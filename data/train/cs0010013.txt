    "and world - wide communications are changing computing concepts as were established some years ago . in the past",
    ", information was stored in trusted hosts where data was managed . in that case , it is easy to see that information security depends on the protection of the hosts themselves .",
    "protection of hosts should be considered as a part of the operating systems design and not as an add - on .",
    "in fact , to ignore last approach opens a wide variety of security holes in modern computer systems @xcite . in any case , hosts protection is more advanced that mobile code protection at present time .",
    "distributed computing requires information to be managed in untrusted and sometimes unknown hosts in the network ; consequently , new data management models must be developed for distributed environments @xcite .",
    "some protection schemes based in the use of partial result authentication codes ( pracs ) ensures a _ perfect forward integrity _ but does not assures backward integrity @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the mobile agent carries the keys that will be used to protect the messages .",
    "each key could be applied to protect only one message being removed from the agent data area after using .",
    "even forward integrity could be compromised .",
    "for example suppose that an agent follows a route @xmath0 , where both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are malicious hosts .",
    "the first hostile node in the route of the agent , that is @xmath1 , could provide a copy of the keys not removed from the mobile agent to the second malicious host , @xmath2 .",
    "the second host could use this information to counterfeit data provided by the hosts that apply these keys .",
    "this fact makes all the hosts in the subset @xmath5 vulnerable .",
    "the same problem will happen if the agent returns to the first malicious host later , showing that backward integrity can not be assured in any case .",
    "the term _ message _ , as applied in this paper , stands for each block of information provided by the remote hosts to either other hosts or mobile agents . the word _ field _ identifies a chunk of the message itself .",
    "we want to note some differences that can be found between mobile agents , mobile code and intelligent agents , to show in detail the problem that could be solved by using the threat described in our work :    * _ mobile agents . _",
    "a mobile agent is a software object that have a code area and a data part .",
    "both code and data areas will convey from a host to another one but the execution thread will not be preserved .",
    "mobile agents could be easily implemented by using serialization in programming languages as java . *",
    "_ mobile code .",
    "_ the most important difference between mobile agents and mobile code is that the latter allows the execution thread to be preserved when the agent goes from one host to the next one . as the execution thread",
    "will be changed in each host visited by the mobile code , to protect this area is not easy . * _ intelligent agents . _",
    "an intelligent agent is a software object that have the ability of process information retrieved autonomously .",
    "these agents does not require to be mobile .",
    "intelligent agents are an active field of study in _ artificial intelligence _",
    "( ai ) at present .",
    "a given agent could be classified in more than one of the groups described above .",
    "for example , a mobile agent could be programmed in a way that allows it to decide the route that it will follow by evaluating the information provided by the _ peer _ ( remote ) hosts , making it both a mobile and an intelligent agent simultaneously .",
    "the threat we propose in our work allows an agent to be protected against both malicious hosts and other agents . these hosts and agents",
    "could try to make unauthorized modifications on either the code area or the data space of the agent or even to remove the information provided by other hosts .",
    "our goal is to protect code and data areas against both counterfeit and erasing .",
    "our technique is based in the use of standard public - key encryption algorithms also known as asymmetric ciphers instead of symmetric ciphers .",
    "we will not propose nor recommend the use of a specific cipher over others in our work .",
    "we are not developing a protection algorithm for the execution thread .",
    "the execution thread is changed by each host where the mobile code arrives . as a consequence",
    ", it can not be easily protected without using a logging system . in our opinion , encryption techniques",
    "could not be used to provide full protection of mobile code .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the notation used in our work .",
    "this notation will be applied to describe digital signature and encryption of data in both the agent server and the peer hosts .    to describe the routes followed by the agents we will define the set @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; this set will denote the @xmath9 hosts followed by the mobile agent released by a given agent server in its @xmath10-th route . in this set , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 , determines the @xmath14-th host in the @xmath10-th route followed by the agent sent by the server @xmath15 .    _",

    "classical protection schemes do not allow a mobile agent to protect its own code area against unauthorized modification easily .",
    "suppose that a server digitally signs the code of an agent before dropping it .",
    "this server must provide copies of the public - key used to other hosts .",
    "this public - key is required to authenticate the code area itself .",
    "this can be done easily by providing a copy of this key to a key - server or by using a ca .",
    "obviously , the agent should be instructed to get this key showing at least the address of both the server that has released it and the host that stores a copy of the key .",
    "at this moment a malicious host , let us say @xmath32 , could change the agent code area and sign it by using its own private / public key pair .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that this modification will not be discovered by the remote hosts if the code is changed in such a way that the agent points to the new public - key .",
    "the hostile host only needs to assure that the signed code area provided by the agent server is recovered before the agent returns to the server that has dropped it .",
    "it is easy to see that code protection could not depend on classical cryptography even if the keys used to authenticate this area are certified and are provided by external trusted authorities . we need to develop a way to link the data provided by the peer hosts with the code part of the agent at the same time",
    ". this will allow us to protect data and code areas simultaneously .",
    "other protection threats have been proposed in recent years .",
    "for example , the use of both code and data areas mess up techniques as described in @xcite . in this reference , hohl recommends the use of variable names that does not means anything .",
    "he also proposed that the code should not be modularized ( _ i.e. _ , it must be written without using subroutines ) and to choose a data representation that makes the program difficult to understand .",
    "this author proposed the use of _ variable recomposition _ techniques , conversion of _ compile - time control flow elements _ into run - time data dependent jumps and the _ insertion of dead code _ , that is code that will not be executed when the agent is running , into the agents .",
    "these techniques are based in mixing up the contents of the variables and creating new variables that contains a few bits of data of some of the original variables .",
    "these are recovered by changing the way the code of the agent handles the access to the variables .",
    "another alternative could be to develop a secure infrastructure for mobile agents @xcite . the use of _ _ encrypted functions _ _ could be obtained without any explicit knowledge of @xmath33 providing @xmath34 $ ] instead of @xmath33 in : @xmath35 & \\!\\!\\!=\\!\\!\\ ! &      { \\rm exp } \\left [ x \\right ] \\cdot { \\rm exp } \\left [ y \\right ] \\nonumber\\cr    { \\rm exp } \\left [ x \\cdot y \\right ] & \\!\\!\\!=\\!\\!\\ ! &      \\left ( { \\rm exp } \\left [ x \\right ] \\right ) ^{y }    \\enspace , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] allowing us to represent the encrypted program as a polynomial . an important",

    "we need protection schemes that do not rely on hiding the algorithms used in code handling or on building trusted environments for agent execution .",
    "another problem is that the execution of encrypted functions requires the development of one - way homomorphic functions .",
    "these functions are unknown at present .    in order to protect both the message provided by the remote host , that we have denoted by @xmath17 , and the mobile agent code area we propose that each host must obtain the next field : @xmath36      + { \\rm crc }      \\left [        f_{{\\rm pri}_{\\rm s } }        \\left [          { \\rm m}_{\\rm code}^{r }        \\right ]      \\right]}_{\\rm provided\\,by\\,the\\,agent\\,server\\ , s }    + { \\rm f}_{i , j}^{r }    \\enspace ,    \\label{eq : crc}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 $ ] stands for the digital signature of the code area @xmath38 .",

    "in fact , each peer host must identify other hosts in the network in soon a way that it does not allows host impersonation techniques . trusted",
    "third parties are needed to avoid well known threats like the middleman attack .",

    "as noted , these attacks could arrive from both other agents and the hosts where the agents are stored . in both cases",
    ", we will protect the agent using the same threat .",
    "as we shown in section iii the agent code area can be protected by adding two crcs to each message provided by the peer hosts .",

    "the attacks against the information carried by mobile agents can be classified in three groups : ( _ i _ ) attacks trying to erase data carried by the agents ( also known as a mobile agent `` brainwashing '' in bibliography ) , ( _ ii _ ) attacks trying to falsify data provided by other hosts and ( _ iii _ ) attacks trying to uncover non - public information carried by the agents .    _ removing information_@xmath16 to avoid a mobile agent `` brainwash '' each host must provide information about the number of messages stored in a particular agent to the rss as we described in section iv .",

    "for example , the cipher - text that corresponds to the @xmath31-th message provided by the @xmath14-th host in the agent route can be erased by changing the agent data area to : @xmath68 even if information about the number of messages carried by the agent is provided in a way that an hostile peer host can not change it , data area can be altered by overwriting it with a _ bit - copy _ of an old data area .    to avoid attacks based in the techniques described above",
    "we propose to send information about the number of messages provided to the agent to the rss shown in the code area of the mobile agent itself .",
    "these hosts can not be changed without invalidating the agent itself .",
    "a copy of the fields @xmath41 , as shown in equation ( [ eq : crc ] ) , is all the information needed to manage it ; in fact , these fields are required to authenticate data provided by each host visited by the mobile agent as shown above .",
    "_ counterfeit of data_@xmath16 even if data have been digitally signed or encrypted information provided can be falsified .",
    "as noted above , data area can be protected against `` brainwashing '' by storing information about the amount of messages provided by each host visited by the agent in separated hosts .",
    "we need a way to protect the information provided by peer hosts to the agent against being overwritten with old signed data provided by those hosts in the past . in section iii",
    "we propose to link data provided as a part of the agent , the fields in @xmath42 as shown in ( [ eq : crc ] ) , with each messages retrieved by the agent .",
    "if this field is not included any hostile host can change the data area of the agent as appears in ( [ eq : dasgn ] ) , overwriting a valid signed message @xmath17 with an old message signed by the same host using the same private / public key pair , let us say @xmath69 : @xmath70 the same problem happens with encrypted messages if the field @xmath71 , obtained by applying ( [ eq : crc ] ) , is not provided as a part of the messages . in this case , the encrypted data area of the mobile agent in ( [ eq : daencr ] ) can be counterfeited by changing one of the cipher - texts provided by the remote hosts , for example the message @xmath28 can be changed to @xmath72 : @xmath73 to avoid information provided by peer hosts to be overwritten by using a bit - copy with old signed data obtained in the same trip we propose to add another field to @xmath42 .",
    "this field is introduced in section iii .",

    "we are not making assumptions about the encryption algorithms used to cover data nor the keys length that may vary in function of the security requirements .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the fact that public - key based ciphers allows predictable patterns to survive the encryption process making this technology vulnerable to cryptanalysis is well known to cryptanalysts ; as a consequence , standard compression techniques should be applied before encryption to increase data security .    _",
    "middleman attack_@xmath16 the man - in - the - middle attack is probably the greatest known vulnerability of asymmetric cryptosystems .",
    "mobile agent based infrastructures can be attacked by using a middleman attack variant . in this case",
    ", a malicious host will intercept both the public - key send to the rss by the remote host and the agent itself .",
    "this host will generate a private / public key pair to falsify data provided by that host and provide a copy of the false public - key to the rss . to avoid the attacks based on this threat the use of cas to verify and sign the keys used by the hosts to protect its own data is recommended .",
    "the mobile agents can be attacked in a way that do not require to modify either the code area or the data part of the agents .",
    "the main goal of these attacks can be to damage the agent infrastructure itself by destroying the agents or releasing new agents instead of the original one .",
    "_ removing agents_@xmath16 any malicious host can remove the agents when arrive to it .",
    "there are no - way to avoid this attack against the agents but or protection threat allows other host to try to discover what host has killed the agent by requesting information about the route followed by the agent .    _",
    "releasing new agents_@xmath16 a hostile host can remove all the information stored in the mobile agent and change the code area .",
    "modifying the code area requires gathering a fake private / public key pair for the agent server but now it is possible because all the @xmath42 fields have been removed from the data area of the agent .",
    "the new private / public key pair can be used to sign a modified code area of the agent .",
    "this fact can be discovered , at least , by the server that has released the agent when it comes back .",
    "if other hosts have a copy of the public - key of the agent server , either obtained by other channels or sent in the past , these hosts can discover the unauthorized modification of the agent too .",
    "our goal is to protect mobile agents against attacks from both peer hosts and other agents .",
    "we are not trying to develop a threat to protect hosts against malicious agents .",
    "attacks against remote hosts could be initiated from both agents and hosts .",
    "the code area protection allows an agent to be protected against malicious changes that could affect how it works . at the same time",
    ", the code protection allows a host to be protected against _ denial of service _ ( dos ) attacks by agent cloning in the sense that the number of clones could be easily verified by using the agent identification number described above .",
    "this allows a host to protect itself by controlling the resources provided to the agents in a _ per - agent _ basis .",
    "the agent identification number allows a host to identify the number of clones of a given agent .",
    "the code protection threat proposed in our work do not permits a hostile host to change the code part of an agent provided by an agent server without invalidating it but , obviously , this host could release its own malicious agents .",
    "mobile agents are an extremely vulnerable piece of software because they are executed in untrusted environments .",
    "both code and data areas must be protected against malicious hosts and agents .",
    "the former requires techniques that does not allow a malicious host to hide the identity of the real agent owner .",
    "the latter requires information provided by remote hosts to be protected against counterfeit and erasing .",
    "the main advantages of the algorithm proposed in this paper are that :    * _ secure communication channels are not required _ allowing a mobile agent to be transmitted over untrusted channels and even stored in malicious hosts where the agent will be shown as plain - text even if trusted communication channels between hosts are established . * _ both code and data areas are protected _ against counterfeit and erasing ; consequently , mobile agents are a more secure and robust platform . *",
    "_ each host could change its own information _ when required .",
    "this allows a host to update information provided permitting the development of more sophisticated agent - based applications , where negotiation between agents and hosts is required .",
    "we hope that our protection scheme allows mobile agent based infrastructures to be protected against other attacks based on threats not covered in this article or even unknown at present .",
    "if this can be achieved , our threat could be a good design principle for mobile agent based information networks .",
