    "the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy was discovered by @xcite . it is the closest known galactic satellite of the milky way , and is in the process of strong tidal disruption , on the way to an eventual merger .",
    "its structure , stellar populations , and distance have been studied extensively by a number of authors , for example , @xcite ( hereafter , ls2k ) .",
    "basic parameters , adopted from @xcite , are : center position ( @xmath4 , b ) = ( 5@xmath561 , @xmath014@xmath51 ) , distance modulus ( m@xmath0m)@xmath6 = 16.9 @xmath20.1 , reddening e(b@xmath0v ) = 0.15 @xmath20.03 .",
    "it has become apparent that the sagittarius dwarf  has experienced a complex star - formation history ( sfh ) , spanning most of the age of the universe ( e.g. , ls2k ) . to accurately determine its sfh requires reliable knowledge of the age - metallicity relation . for sagittarius ,",
    "this remains elusive , as shown by the more than factor of five difference betwen mean metallicity estimates in the literature .",
    "optical and near - infrared ( nir ) cmd analyses have usually yielded low values for the mean metallicity ( c.f .",
    "sarajedini & layden 1995 , ls2k ) .",
    "table 1 shows a selection of cmd - based metallicities from the literature .",
    "the literature average derived by @xcite is [ fe / h ] = @xmath01.1 @xmath20.2 , with a spread of @xmath20.5 dex intrinsic to the galaxy .",
    "direct measurements of the abundance based on high - dispersion , high signal - to - noise spectroscopy of a few red giants have determined a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath00.25 ( bonifacio et al .",
    "2000 , smecker - hane & mcwilliam 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "this number is surprisingly high : for comparison , the mean metallicity of the rgb in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath00.55 @xcite .",
    "if the true mean metallicity of the sagittarius dwarf  is [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath00.25 , the galaxy would be enriched by nearly an order of magnitude above the mean [ fe / h]m@xmath8 relation for dwarf galaxies . like the lmc , the sagittarius dwarf  does not appear to be strongly enhanced in the @xmath9-elements relative to the solar - scaled abundance ( bonifacio et al .",
    "2000 , pagel & tautvaiien 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the continuing discrepancy between photometric and spectroscopic metallicity estimates motivates a study of the nir ( j@xmath0k , k ) cmd of the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "there have been fewer studies of sagittarius in the nir than in the optical , so a new look at the nir cmd is needed .",
    "the nir is less susceptible to systematic errors from interstellar reddening .",
    "new methods for metallicity estimation via the nir colors of red giants have recently been published @xcite . and finally , the superb photometric uniformity and precision of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) permits the direct comparison of a sagittarius field with other objects , e.g. , the lmc .",
    "the central region of the sagittarius dwarf  is contained within the 2mass second incremental data release , and is available electronically  .",
    "we present the 2mass cmd of the region within 1@xmath1 of the center of the sagittarius dwarf  in  2 , make a new photometric determination of the metallicity in  3 , and place our results in the context of earlier work in  4 .",
    "the 2mass survey was carried out at mt .",
    "hopkins and cerro tololo , using dedicated 1.3 m telescopes .",
    "data were obtained in the j , h , and k@xmath10 ( `` k short '' ) passbands , and processed , photometered , and calibrated at ipac .",
    "further details are contained in the 2mass explanatory supplement @xcite .",
    "we selected stars from the    0.3 cm 0.3 cm 2mass point source catalog within 1@xmath1 of the center of the sagittarius dwarf  galaxy , excluding stars within the tidal radius of the globular cluster m 54 .",
    "we selected sources with good psf - fit magnitudes in all three survey bands , excluding objects associated with extended sources or minor planets .",
    "the mean photometric error of selected objects , for k@xmath10 @xmath11 14 , is @xmath12j = 0.03 , @xmath12k@xmath10 = 0.04 .",
    "the resulting cmd is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the rgb of the sagittarius dwarf  is the feature extending brightward and redward of the local m - dwarf plume from ( j@xmath0k@xmath10 , k@xmath10 ) @xmath7 ( 1,14 ) to ( 1.25 , 10.6 ) .",
    "the rgb is surmounted by asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , extending nearly a magnitude brighter , and a red plume of carbon stars ( as already noted by ibata et al .",
    "the three other `` fingers '' of the cmd are the disk main - sequence , the disk / bulge red clump , and the disk / bulge red giants .",
    "the reddening maps of @xcite show very small differential reddening across this field : @xmath13 = 0.015 .",
    "more than 1400 stars are contained in the distinct sagittarius dwarf  rgb .",
    "because the color of the rgb is metallicity - dependent , the eye tends to emphasize the most metal - rich stars .",
    "it is apparent from the comparable color extent of the foreground rgb and the main sagittarius rgb that the sagittarius dwarf  is quite metal rich .",
    "while stars appear to fill in the entire metallicity range between the foreground plume and the metal - rich population , most of the stars are concentrated towards the metal - rich end .",
    "the equations relating rgb color and slope to [ fe / h ] from @xcite and @xcite refer to the cit / ctio system @xcite .",
    "we use the color transformations computed by @xcite to transform the 2mass natural magnitudes to this system .",
    "we adopt the distance and reddening quoted above ,    0.3 cm 0.3 cm deriving a@xmath14 = 0.048 , and e(j@xmath0k ) = 0.084 from the relations in @xcite .",
    "we show the derived cmd in figure 2 .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "2 is overlain with empirical , linear fits to globular cluster rgbs derived from @xcite , for [ fe / h ] = @xmath01.5 , @xmath01.0 , and @xmath00.5 .",
    "the right panel is overlain by isochrones from @xcite , for age - metallicity pairs ( 10 gyr , z=0.001 , 5 gyr , z=0.004 , 2.5 gyr , z=0.008 ) , chosen following ls2k .",
    "the effect of age - metallicity degeneracy is apparent from the similarity of the 2.5 gyr and 5 gyr tracks .",
    "figure 2 plainly shows that the bulk of the stellar population in the center of the sagittarius dwarf  is of intermediate - age , and only moderately metal - poor .",
    "quantitative estimates of the mean metallicty can be derived from the rgb color and slope ( e.g. , ivanov et al .",
    "the rgb slope method has the advantage that it is independent of distance and reddening . for 1410 stars brighter than m@xmath14 = @xmath04",
    ", we derive a slope d(j@xmath0k)/dk = @xmath00.106 @xmath20.002 , with an rms deviation of 0.039 , comparable to the photometric error and indicating a high quality of fit . according to the calibration of @xcite ,",
    "this implies a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.46 @xmath20.06 .",
    "the precision in the relation is estimated to be 0.2 dex . if instead we adopt the calibration of @xcite , we find [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.45 @xmath20.05 , with an estimated precision of 0.25 dex .",
    "another recent calibration is given by @xcite ; it gives [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.49 @xmath20.05 on the carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) scale , or @xmath00.38 @xmath20.05 on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) scale .",
    "@xcite also provide a relation between the rgb color at m@xmath14 = @xmath05.5 and metallicity ; this is distance and reddening dependent .",
    "application of their calibration to 79 stars between @xmath05.6 @xmath11 m@xmath14 @xmath11 @xmath05.4 , we find @xmath15(j@xmath0k)@xmath16 = 0.967 @xmath20.040 , yielding [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.49 @xmath20.27",
    ".    while these values are high compared to the literature average of photometrically - determined abundances , they may in fact be too low .",
    "first , the relations are calibrated according to globular clusters ; age effects may bias the results low by 0.10.2 dex @xcite . and second , the calibrating globulars are enhanced in their abundance of @xmath9-elements relative to a scaled solar abundance , so that their effective metallicities [ m / h ] are higher than their true metallicities [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , carney 1996 ) .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf  is not @xmath9-enhanced @xcite , further contributing to a photometric abundance underestimate .",
    "these effects may be partially countered by the relative difficulty of separating metal - poor stars from the foreground .",
    "we can estimate the metallicity spread by looking at the color distribution of the rgb .",
    "figure 3 shows the ( j@xmath0k@xmath10 ) color histogram for all stars between 11 @xmath11 k@xmath10 @xmath11 12.5 .",
    "the bright limit was chosen to avoid large bias against the metal - poor stars , and the faint limit was chosen to minimize confusion with differentially reddened foreground stars .",
    "the colors were shifted by 0.106(k@xmath10@xmath012.5 ) to account for the rgb slope .",
    "the peak corresponding to the sagittarius rgb is distinct and narrow at j@xmath0k@xmath10 @xmath7 1 .",
    "the dashed line shows the results of a gaussian fit , with the @xmath12 constrained to be equal to the mean photometric error @xmath17 = 0.05 .",
    "it is seen that the rgb width is barely wider than the photometric error on the red side , but a significant tail exists on the blue side . as expected",
    ", there is little evidence for differential reddening .",
    "the exact proportion of stars in the blue tail is hard to determine precisely , because of contamination by the much larger number of foreground giants .",
    "a very rough estimate can be made by assuming that all of the stars in fig .",
    "3 with j@xmath0k@xmath10 @xmath18 0.85 are sagittarius members .",
    "dividing the area under the gaussian fit by the total number of    0.3 cm 0.3 cm stars redward of this limit suggests that @xmath3 2/3 of the rgb belongs to the population with [ fe / h ] @xmath191 . according to ls2k ,",
    "this dominant population would be 0.57 gyr old .",
    "due to the probable inclusion of some foreground , as well as the likely exclusion of some of the most metal - poor giants , we estimate the uncertainty in this fraction to be at least @xmath220% .",
    "comparison to a control field did not prove useful in determining the relative numbers more precisely , because the detailed morphology of the foreground is highly dependent on small - scale reddening variations as well as larger scale spiral structure , yielding a very uncertain subtraction .",
    "by analyzing the slope of the rgb in the ( j@xmath0k , k ) cmd , we have determined a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.5 @xmath20.2 for the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "theoretical considerations regarding the age and [ @xmath9/fe ] of sagittarius relative to galactic globular clusters imply that this may be an underestimate by @xmath30.2 dex .",
    "thus , the photometric abundance of the main sagittarius rgb is in reasonable agreement with the recently determined results from high - resolution spectroscopy ( bonifacio et al .",
    "2000 , smecker - hane & mcwilliam 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "the true abundance distribution in our cmd is masked by age - metallicity degeneracy due to the temporally extended sfh of the sagittarius dwarf(ls2k ) .",
    "we agree with previous cmd analyses that have found a large spread in metallicity , but we find a larger fraction of high - metallicity stars than low - metallicity ones .",
    "the color histogram of the rgb sample shows that there is a significant tail of low - metallicity stars in sagittarius dwarf  that has not been represented in the spectroscopic sample .",
    "very roughly , one - third of the sagittarius rgb is too blue in j@xmath0k@xmath10 to be accounted for by the high - metallicity population .",
    "this is contrary to the scenario proposed by @xcite in which the @xmath710 gyr epoch contributed the majority of stars to the sagittarius field , and implies a longer period of significant star formation .",
    "it is important to remember that our field is    0.3 cm 0.3 cm located at the center of the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "@xcite find that the intermediate - age population is strongly concentrated in this region , and @xcite have shown evidence for a lower average metallicity in radially distant fields .",
    "this issue will be explored using 2mass data in a future paper .",
    "the colors of theoretical isochrones in the ( ( j@xmath0k)@xmath6 , m@xmath14 ) plane are consistent with the age - metallicity relation proposed by @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of intermediate - age stars is consistent with the significant population of agb stars above the trgb , and carbon stars with colors as red as j@xmath0k@xmath10 @xmath7 2.5 .",
    "it is difficult to precisely determine the ratio of metal - poor to metal - rich stars because of contaminating foreground .",
    "the previously published nir cmd of sagittarius , by @xcite , reported a low metallicity for the galaxy , in contrast to what we find here .",
    "however , this result was based on a small number of stars , and relied on a comparison to the globular cluster 47 tuc .",
    "this comparison is not necessarily a good one , because of the large age difference and because the @xmath9-enhancement of 47 tuc by @xmath70.2 dex changes its rgb morphology ( e.g. , vazdekis et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "both effects combine to shift the 47 tuc rgb to the red , relative to sagittarius , mimicking a metal - poor sagittarius .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite obtain a value of [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.58 @xmath20.25 from the slope of the rgb , but reject this in favor of the direct comparison to 47 tuc .",
    "a more natural comparison object for the sagittarius dwarf  is the lmc .",
    "both objects are apparently dominated by intermediate - age stars , and neither is predicted to be highly @xmath9-enhanced .",
    "we overlay the contours of the lmc hess diagram on our sagittarius cmd in figure 4 .",
    "the contours are logarithmically spaced to highlight the agb . to make the comparison ,",
    "the lmc data have been shifted by @xmath20(m@xmath0 m ) = @xmath01.5 , @xmath20e(b@xmath0v ) = 0.075 .",
    "figure 4 shows a remarkable similarity between the two galaxies .",
    "the sagittarius rgb is far narrower than the lmc s ; but it overlaps exactly with the red half of the lmc rgb , in good agreement with the metallicity estimates .",
    "the slight mismatch in the location of the rgb tip may be due to an error in the relative distance moduli ; in the ( j@xmath0k@xmath10 , k@xmath10 ) plane it is also in the correct sense if the sagittarius dwarf  reaches a higher metallicity than the lmc .",
    "the lmc contours trace an rgb to colors blueward of j@xmath0k@xmath10 = 0.9 , mapping the extension to lower metallicities also seen in sagittarius .",
    "both galaxies contain a population of bright agb stars and carbon stars , which overlap to a remarkable extent in color and magnitude .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf galaxy has undergone a high degree of chemical processing ; far more than expected given its current lack of gas and small mass .",
    "this may support the hypothesis first put forward by @xcite that sagittarius may have been a much larger galaxy early in its lifetime and is in the last stages of disruption .",
    "alternatively , it could have captured milky way gas during a previous passage through the galactic disk .",
    "it is necessary to obtain spectroscopic abundances for a large number of sagittarius giants , especially on the blue side of the rgb , in order to trace the variation of abundance and @xmath9-enhancement with time .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and ipac / caltech , funded by nasa and the nsf .",
