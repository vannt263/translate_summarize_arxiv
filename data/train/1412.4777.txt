    "astronomy with tev gamma rays has opened a new window to the universe , allowing us to study a plethora of fantastic sources of very high - energy photons  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sources themselves , we can study intervening phenomena .",
    "in particular , the radiation emitted by all stars , the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , absorbs photons by @xmath3 . as a result ,",
    "the horizon is only some 100  mpc and the observed source spectra are strongly modified .",
    "one can use this effect to explore the ebl which is hard to measure directly @xcite .",
    "more fundamentally , the fast time structure of certain sources allows one to constrain novel dispersion effects , for example by lorentz invariance violation @xcite .",
    "we are here concerned with another effect at the low - energy frontier of elementary particle physics @xcite , the conversion of photons into axionlike particles ( alps ) in large - scale magnetic fields @xcite , enabled by the two - photon vertex of these hypothetical low - mass bosons .",
    "the conversion @xmath4 modifies the source spectra .",
    "the conversion and subsequent back conversion @xmath5 allows tev gamma rays to `` propagate in disguise '' and evade absorption by @xmath6 pair production @xcite .",
    "this effect is a possible explanation of the cosmic transparency problem , i.e. , tev gamma rays seem to travel further than allowed by typical ebl estimates . at the very least ,",
    "this effect represents a systematic uncertainty when probing the ebl with tev gamma rays .",
    "photon and alp propagation and conversion is most easily studied in analogy to neutrino flavor oscillations @xcite .",
    "a wave of frequency @xmath7 and amplitude @xmath8 evolves in the @xmath9 direction according to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the refractive index which gives us the wave number by @xmath12 .",
    "we write @xmath13 and assume @xmath14 .",
    "the real part @xmath15 describes dispersion and the imaginary part @xmath16 absorption .",
    "@xmath8 has three components , the photon amplitude @xmath17 with polarization perpendicular to the transverse @xmath0-field , @xmath18 parallel to it , and the alp amplitude @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are now 3@xmath213 matrices .",
    "the off - diagonal @xmath15 elements cause oscillations between different @xmath8-components such as the faraday effect , where electrons in the longitudinal @xmath0-field instigate a rotation of the plane of polarization .",
    "alps interact with photons by @xmath22 in terms of the electric , magnetic , and alp fields whereas @xmath23 is a coupling constant of dimension inverse energy .",
    "an external transverse magnetic field @xmath24 couples @xmath18 with @xmath19 and provides an off - diagonal refractive index @xmath25 which leads to alp - photon oscillations .",
    "( we always use natural units with @xmath26 . )",
    "the alp dispersion relation is @xmath27 , providing the refractive index @xmath28 .",
    "an analogous expression pertains to photons where the plasma frequency @xmath29 is the effective photon mass .",
    "more important for tev @xmath30-ray dispersion is the @xmath0-field itself due to an effective photon - photon interaction mediated by virtual @xmath6 pairs . at low energies ,",
    "it is described by the euler - heisenberg lagrangian @xmath31 $ ] , which however also pertains to background photons . the overall electromagnetic ( em ) energy density @xmath32 produces @xcite @xmath33 implying spacelike dispersion @xmath34 , i.e. , a `` negative effective mass - squared . ''",
    "large - scale fields or nonisotropic background photons imply further geometrical factors depending on direction of motion and polarization .",
    "if the em background is a homogeneous @xmath0-field , the dispersion of @xmath18 receives a factor and @xmath35 for these coefficients , respectively , a factor 2/3 smaller .",
    "we had mistakenly included @xmath36 in these expressions .",
    "we thank m.  roncadelli for pointing out this error .",
    "notice that for an isotropic gas of unpolarized test photons , averaging over directions leads to @xmath36 and averaging over polarizations leads to @xmath37 , i.e. , their average dispersion in a @xmath0-field is indeed given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : chiem ] ) . ] @xmath38 , whereas @xmath17 a factor @xmath39 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath40 is the angle between the photon and @xmath0-field directions , i.e. , only the transverse field strength @xmath24 enters .",
    "these results correspond to what has been used in studies of tev @xmath30-ray propagation .    a minimal em energy density everywhere is @xmath41 provided by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , where we have used @xmath42 , leading to @xmath43 a typical galactic @xmath0-field of @xmath44 corresponds to @xmath45 , so the cmb dominates by a factor of ten . depending on the environment , dispersion of tev gamma rays involves the cmb and possible larger local radiation densities .",
    "this insight is our main point .",
    "to develop a sense of the quantitative importance of this effect we consider @xmath46 conversion in the galaxy .",
    "we consider propagation in the @xmath9 direction in a transverse @xmath0-field , leading to @xmath47 here , @xmath48 with the cmb and @xmath0-field contributions .",
    "in addition , there can be contributions from other photon populations .",

    "@xmath53    where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for completeness",
    "we have included the electron contribution , which is completely negligible .",
    "the term @xmath59 exceeds all others , corresponding to maximal mixing .",
    "indeed , the considered alp masses are in the nev range to achieve this effect .",
    "the alp and photon dispersion relations have opposite sign ( timelike vs.  spacelike ) so that the two effects add up in the expression for @xmath60",
    ". they can not cancel each other and must be separately small to achieve large mixing .    therefore , @xmath61 dispersion will be unimportant only if @xmath62 .",
    "the above parameters satisfy this condition , but maximal mixing can be lost , and @xmath61 dispersion becomes important , for smaller @xmath23 or weaker @xmath0 ( e.g.  in intergalactic space ) .",
    "likewise , @xmath63  tev , keeping all else fixed , implies @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , the radiation fields in the galaxy , in the tev source regions , and the ebl provide additional contributions .",
    "however , these photons typically exceed the pair - production threshold so that we need to go beyond the low - energy limit to estimate their dispersive effect on tev @xmath30 propagation .",
    "so far , our results apply when pair creation can be neglected . in a static @xmath0-field",
    ", this is true when the dynamical parameter @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this condition is easily fulfilled in our context .",
    "pair production in the cmb becomes important for @xmath63  tev .",
    "however , for tev @xmath30 rays propagating in the ebl or the galactic star light , the euler - heisenberg limit breaks down .",
    "the only pertinent literature is john toll s often - cited phd thesis ( 1952 ) @xcite which we have actually found in our library .",
    "however , his results may be incorrect .",
    "the plot of @xmath66 in fig",
    ".  2.2  b , which is proportional to the squared forward - scattering amplitude and thus to @xmath67 , does not have a zero .",
    "our numerical integration of his equations does not reproduce his fig .",
    "2.2  b. ] and we perform our own analysis .",
    "the dispersive part @xmath15 of the refractive index is related to the imaginary part @xmath68 ( absorption rate @xmath69 ) by the kramers - kronig relation  @xcite @xmath70 where the integral denotes the cauchy principal value .",
    "we assume background photons with number density @xmath71 , energy @xmath72 , and direction @xmath40 relative to the test photon .",
    "then @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the total @xmath75 cross section @xcite . here",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 is the threshold energy for pair production defined by @xmath78 and @xmath79 we show this function in fig .  [",
    "fig : gplot ] as a black line .",
    "the dispersive part of the refractive index therefore is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chiem ] ) with @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the limit @xmath84 we find @xmath85 . taking the angle average in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chigeneral ] ) we find @xmath86 , i.e. , the kramers - kronig transformation reproduces the euler - heisenberg result stated earlier .",
    "we note that background photons collinear with the test photon produce no refractive effect , head - on moving ones produce the largest effect .",
    "this behavior is similar to neutrino - neutrino refraction , although for neutrinos the factor is only @xmath87 .",
    "of course , the origin of the angle dependence is very different in the two cases .",
    "we show @xmath88 in fig .",
    "[ fig : gplot ] as a blue line and note that it has a cusp at the pair - creation threshold @xmath89 , it crosses zero at @xmath90 , and then approaches zero asymptotically from below .",
    "unsurprisingly , the dispersion relation becomes timelike for high energies .",
    "however , it does not approach the form of an effective mass , i.e. , @xmath91 does not become proportional to @xmath92 for high energies .",
    "note that @xmath93 for large @xmath94 and the integral @xmath95 does not converge . in this context",
    "we note that for very large photon energies , the process @xmath96 acquires a constant cross section of order @xmath97 and thus becomes more important than @xmath98 @xcite .",

    "we conclude that for a given @xmath106 , low - energy background photons below the pair threshold are most important for dispersion , whereas photons around the pair threshold are most important for absorption . in intergalactic space ,",
    "the ebl is the most important photon population for the absorption of tev @xmath30 rays , but @xmath116 is only about @xmath117 .",
    "for tev photons , the cmb is far more important for dispersion than the ebl .        . ]",
    "the radiation density in the galaxy can far exceed the cmb . the main component is star light ( sl ) which , however , is partly processed by dust to form infrared radiation ( ir ) . in fig .  [",
    "fig : isrf ] we show the estimated spectral energy distribution of these components in the galaxy near the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "the ir energy density is comparable to the cmb whereas the sl provides about 2.6 times more energy . at smaller galactocentric distances ,",
    "the non - cmb contributions are much larger .",
    "another way of estimating the importance of star light is to use the total galactic luminosity of about @xmath118 and , if the source were concentrated at the galactic center , would provide @xmath119 .",
    "of course , the disk geometry requires a detailed model , e.g. , the one of the galprop code @xcite that we used for fig .",
    "[ fig : isrf ] .",
    "the corresponding @xmath61 refractive index is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : refr ] as a function of the test - photon energy . for @xmath120  gev ,",
    "all background radiations contribute essentially with their euler - heisenberg strength , whereas for higher energies , first the star light and then the infrared radiation drop out .",
    "the cmb contribution becomes small and finally negative only at @xmath121  tev .",
    "photon - photon refraction leads to deflection , e.g. , in the radiation field of the sun . in the euler - heisenberg limit and for photons grazing the sun",
    ", we find an energy - independent deflection of @xmath122 arcsec , much smaller than the gravitational deflection of @xmath123 arcsec .",
    "photon - photon dispersion matters only in the context of @xmath30-alp oscillations where interference with the alp dispersion enhances the effect    in the early universe , there is a brief epoch when @xmath61 dispersion dominates . as the universe cools , the @xmath6 density is @xmath124 , producing @xmath125 .",
    "photons provide @xmath126 , corresponding to @xmath127 and a thermal average @xmath128 .",
    "this is similar to @xmath129 at @xmath130 , in agreement with the crossover shown in fig .",
    "3.6 of ref .",
    "the cosmic @xmath131 ratio is about @xmath132 so that @xmath133 .",
    "it takes over from @xmath61 dispersion at @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , in the primordial plasma , @xmath61 dispersion dominates when @xmath135 , providing photons with a spacelike dispersion relation .",
    "note , however , that the photon gas does not support longitudinal excitations and does not contribute to debye screening  @xcite .",
    "we also mention a recent study of the impact of photon - photon interaction on the polarization of cmb photons after recombination  @xcite , although the effect looks extremely small .",
    "photon - photon interaction is a polarization - dependent effect and therefore can lead to nontrivial birefringence effects  @xcite .",
    "a photon gas is a dispersive medium for photon propagation .",
    "the ubiquitous cmb alone produces @xmath136 , independently of energy if @xmath137  tev .",
    "this tiny effect dominates the dispersion of tev gamma rays and , while it has always been ignored , can modify the oscillation between tev gamma rays and axionlike particles in astrophysical magnetic fields .",
    "if the energies of the background photons exceed the pair - creation threshold , the dispersion effect decreases , i.e. , soft background photons are more important .",
    "therefore , even though radiation in the galaxy or the source regions can far exceed the cmb , their harder spectra prevent them from having a large impact on dispersion except for relatively small energies of @xmath138  gev . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath61 dispersion is weaker for smaller @xmath7 , so while the relative importance of local radiation fields is larger for smaller @xmath7 , the absolute importance of the overall effect decreases .",
    "photon - alp oscillations depend on the @xmath139 interaction strength , the @xmath0-field strength and spatial distribution , the alp mass , the photon energy , and , as a new ingredient , the density and spectrum of background photons .",
    "it is fortuitous that for many scenarios considered in the literature , @xmath61 dispersion will be a benign effect and does not exclude that alps could be important for tev gamma propagation in the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect is large enough that it can not be summarily dismissed ",
    "its quantitative importance has to be evaluated in every individual case .",

    "<S> the propagation of tev gamma rays can be strongly modified by @xmath0-field induced conversion to axionlike particles ( alps ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , at such high energies , photon dispersion is dominated by background photons  the only example where photon - photon dispersion is of practical relevance . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the refractive index for all energies and find that , for fixed energy density , background photons below the pair - production threshold dominate . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmic microwave background alone provides an `` effective photon mass '' of @xmath1 for @xmath2  tev . </S>",
    "<S> the extragalactic background light is subdominant , but local radiation fields in the galaxy or the source regions provide significant contributions . </S>",
    "<S> photon - photon dispersion is small enough to leave typical scenarios of photon - alp oscillations unscathed , but big enough to worry about it case by case . </S>"
