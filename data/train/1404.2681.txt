    "given a binary tree , @xmath1 , suppose that a state from some set @xmath2 is assigned uniformly at random to the root of @xmath1 .",
    "this state then evolves down the tree to the tips of the tree according to a continuous - time markovian process on @xmath2 , acting along the edges of the tree .",
    "given the states at the tips of a tree , _ ancestral state reconstruction _ aims to estimate the state that was present at the root of the tree .",
    "this problem is particularly relevant to certain questions in evolutionary biology @xcite .",
    "the performance of any ancestral state reconstruction methods depends on the underlying tree ( its topology and branch lengths ) ; accordingly , to compare the performance of different ancestral state reconstruction methods , it is helpful to sample trees from some underlying null distribution . in evolutionary biology ,",
    "a natural and widely - used null process is the yule pure - birth model @xcite , starting with a single lineage at time 0 and grown for time @xmath3 with birth rate @xmath4 , and this is the model we study here .",
    "moreover , for the rest of this paper , we will consider the simple continuous - time markov process , on the state space @xmath5 with an instantaneous substitution rate @xmath6 between the two states .",
    "notice that there are two random processes at play here  the generation of the tree and the substitution process that then applies along the edges of this tree .",
    "a straightforward information - theoretic argument shows that any method for estimating the root state at a yule tree can not achieve an accuracy that is strictly bounded above @xmath7 as @xmath3 grows , when @xmath8 , even when the tree and its branch lengths are given @xcite . if just the tree topology is known ( but",
    "not necessarily its branch lengths ) then a natural and often used ancestral state reconstruction approach is to assign a root state that minimises the number of state changes in the tree required to explain the states at the leaves .",
    "this method is known as _",
    "maximum parsimony _ and it was shown in @xcite that when @xmath9 , this method does no better than guessing the root state , as @xmath10 ( for @xmath11 , the probability of correct reconstruction ( as @xmath10 ) is strictly greater than @xmath7 and converges to @xmath12 as @xmath13 ) . the difference between these two ancestral state reconstruction methods is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     with seven leaves .",
    "for the states at the leaves shown , majority rule will assign state @xmath14 to the unknown root state @xmath15 , while maximum parsimony will assign state @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( since @xmath18 requires just two state changes in the tree , while @xmath19 requires at least three ) . ]",
    "there is an even simpler way to estimate the root state from the leaf states , which does not even require us to know the tree topology .",
    "this is to simply count the number of leaves in each state and use a majority state as the estimate ( ties are broken randomly ) . for this",
    "_ majority rule _",
    "method , the question of determining the ratio of @xmath20 at which root state estimation retains some accuracy as @xmath10 was posed in @xcite . in this note",
    ", we show that this transition occurs for majority rule at @xmath21 , which is therefore the smallest possible ratio . in particular",
    ", there is a range ( @xmath22 ) within which simple majority rule will outperform a recursive method that explicitly uses the tree topology information ( maximum parsimony ) , despite the fact that for some trees , maximum parsimony can have higher accuracy than majority rule @xcite .",
    "our findings are consistent with simulations that have suggested that majority rule tends to have higher overall accuracy for ancestral state reconstruction on yule trees than maximum parsimony @xcite , and complement a recent study of ancestral state reconstruction on yule trees for continuous characters evolving under an ornstein  uhlenbeck process @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results to results on census reconstruction from  @xcite .",
    "theorem 1.4 in  @xcite implies that when @xmath23 , then the reconstruction problem is _",
    "census solvable_. this means that there is a linear estimator @xmath24 of the root in terms of the leaves @xmath25 which is correlated with the root of the tree .",
    "the coefficients of this linear estimator depend on the topology and edge lengths of the tree .",
    "in contrast , we are interested in the simpler estimator which is simply given by the majority of the leaf values and show that it results in correlated reconstruction for @xmath23 .",
    "interestingly , our proof shows that for the yule tree , the majority reconstruction estimator maximizes the reconstruction probability among all reconstruction methods which are functions of the number of @xmath14 and @xmath16 leaves only .",
    "first recall that under the symmetric 2-state process , if the initial state is + 1 , the state @xmath26 after time @xmath3 is the random variable with distribution : @xmath27 notice that : @xmath28 = e^{-2mt}.\\ ] ] let @xmath29 be the set of leaves at time @xmath3 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath30 has a geometric distribution with parameter @xmath31 ( and so @xmath32 converges in distribution to an exponential distribution with mean 1 ) . in particular",
    ", we have : @xmath33 = e^{\\lambda t}.\\ ] ] let @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the state at leaf @xmath36 on the resulting yule tree , conditional on the root of the tree being in state @xmath14 .",
    "we first compute the first moment of @xmath37 .",
    "( [ ee ] ) gives @xmath38 = { { \\mathbb e}}[{{\\mathbb e}}[s_t|n_t ] ] = { { \\mathbb e}}[n_t \\cdot e^{-2mt}]$ ] from which eqn .",
    "( [ leq ] ) gives : @xmath39 = e^{(\\lambda -2m)t}.\\ ] ]",
    "calculating the second moment of @xmath37 requires a little more care .",
    "first , observe that we may write : @xmath40 where @xmath41 consequently , since @xmath42 , we have : @xmath43 = e^{\\lambda t } + f(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath44 $ ] for @xmath45    now , suppose that , for the yule tree grown for time @xmath3 , two leaves @xmath36 and @xmath46 have a most - recent common ancestor at time @xmath47 .",
    "then conditional on this , @xmath48 = e^{-4mt'},\\ ] ] where expectation is with respect to the substitution process alone .",
    "the function @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 , and , by the nature of the yule pure - birth process , and eqn .",

    "now , @xmath56 , so if we apply this , along with eqn.([leq ] ) in eqn .  ( [ central ] ) , and collect together all terms of quadratic or higher order in @xmath53 , we obtain : @xmath57 rearranging this , and letting @xmath58 , we obtain the following linear differential equation for @xmath49 : @xmath59 solving for @xmath60 is standard ( using the integrating factor @xmath61 and the initial condition @xmath50 gives @xmath62 ) and so : @xmath63    this , and eqn .",
    "( [ ee2 ] ) leads to the following result :    [ helpsprop ] @xmath64 = e^{{\\lambda}t } + f(t),$ ] where @xmath49 is given by ( [ deq2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , when @xmath23 , then for all @xmath65 : @xmath66}{{{\\mathbb e}}[s_t]^2}= e^{-rt }   + \\frac{1}{(1 - 4m/\\lambda)}(1 - e^{-rt}),\\ ] ] where @xmath67 .",
    "we note that exactly the same proof can be applied to @xmath68 , which is @xmath37 conditioned on the root being @xmath69 we will use this to establish our desired result .",
    "out next goal is to show the following .",
    "[ lemhelps ] provided @xmath23 , then for @xmath67 : @xmath72 and the expression on the right is a monotone decreasing function of @xmath3 , from @xmath12 ( at @xmath73 ) to @xmath74 ( as @xmath10 ) .",
    "we first recall that the total variation distance between any two random variables @xmath75 on the same probability space @xmath76 is defined by : @xmath77   - { { \\mathbb p}}[y = \\omega]|.\\ ] ] a dual definition , which will be used in the proof of the lemma , is given by : @xmath78 : x ' \\sim x , y ' \\sim y \\},\\ ] ] where the infimum is taken over all random variables on @xmath79 with @xmath80 having the same distribution as @xmath17 , and with @xmath81 having the same distribution as @xmath82 ( such @xmath83 is called a coupling of @xmath17 and @xmath82 ) .",
    "let @xmath84 be a coupling of @xmath71 and @xmath70 .",
    "we will use  ( [ eq : tvdef2 ] ) to place a lower bound on the total variation distance by providing a lower bound on @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "this is a standard application of the second moment method ( see e.g.  @xcite , proposition 7.8 ) . using paley  zygmund s second moment inequality , one has : @xmath86",
    "\\geq \\frac{({{\\mathbb e}}[|x - y|])^2}{{{\\mathbb e}}[(x - y)^2 ] } .\\ ] ] by jensen s inequality one has @xmath87)^2 \\geq ( { { \\mathbb e}}[x ] - { { \\mathbb e}}[y])^2 = 4{{\\mathbb e}}[s_{t,+}]^2.\\ ] ] moreover , @xmath88   \\leq 2 { { \\mathbb e}}[x^2 ] + 2 { { \\mathbb e}}[y^2 ] = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2 } ( { { \\mathbb e}}[s_{t,+}^2 ] + { { \\mathbb e}}[s_{t,-}^2 ] ) =   4 { { \\mathbb e}}[s_{t,+}^2].\\ ] ]",
    "thus we have proved that : @xmath89 ^ 2}{{{\\mathbb e}}[s_{t,+}^2]},\\ ] ] and lemma  [ lemhelps ] now follows from proposition [ helpsprop ] ( noting that @xmath37 in that proposition is @xmath71 ) .",
    "this completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "in order to complete the proof , we will establish the following lemma .",
    "[ helps2 ] for all @xmath65 , the probability @xmath90 that majority rule reconstructs the root state correctly is given by : @xmath91    let @xmath92 and let @xmath93 denote the root value .",
    "then , by rewriting  ( [ eq : tvdef1 ] ) , we see that : @xmath94   - { { \\mathbb p}}[s = s | \\sigma = -1]|.\\ ] ] moreover , the probability of reconstruction by majority rule is given by : @xmath95 { { \\mathbb p}}[\\sigma = + 1 | s = s ] +   \\sum_{s < 0 } { { \\mathbb p}}[s = s ] { { \\mathbb p}}[\\sigma = -1 | s = s ] +   \\frac{1}{2 } { { \\mathbb p}}[s = 0].\\ ] ] since @xmath96 + { { \\mathbb p}}[\\sigma = -1 | s = s ] = 1 $ ] , we can rewrite @xmath96 $ ] as @xmath97-{{\\mathbb p}}[\\sigma = -1 | s = s])$ ] and similarly for the other terms .",
    "we thus obtain the following from  ( [ eq : m1 ] ) : @xmath98 ( { { \\mathbb p}}[\\sigma = + 1 | s = s ]   - { { \\mathbb p}}[\\sigma = -1 | s = s]){\\rm sgn}(s ) \\\\   & = \\frac{1}{2 } + \\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{s } ( { { \\mathbb p}}[s = s | \\sigma = + 1 ]   - { { \\mathbb p}}[s = s | \\sigma = -1 ] ) { \\rm sgn}(s ) .",
    "\\label{eq : m2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing  ( [ eq : m2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : d ] ) , we see that in order to prove the lemma , it suffices to show that if @xmath99 then @xmath100 > { { \\mathbb p}}[s_t = s | -1]$ ] , while if @xmath101 then @xmath100 < { { \\mathbb p}}[s_t = s | -1]$ ] .",
    "the proof of this follows from the reflection principle .",
    "consider the markov chain @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the population size .",
    "let @xmath1 be the first stopping time where @xmath104 ( @xmath105 if it does not happen ) .",
