    "the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has driven the search for materials to capture and sequester carbon dioxide at a low - enough cost to be economically viable .",
    "metal - organic framework ( mof ) materials offer great promise for the capture of co@xmath0.@xcite absorption and desorption from mof materials via swings of temperature and pressure in principle requires less energy than do current aqueous capture technologies.@xcite in addition , mof materials can be created with a wide variety of pore sizes , shapes , connectivities , and topologies .",
    "these attributes , as well as the effects of cation substitution on metal sites , can in principle be used to tailor both the physical and chemical interactions of the mof with gas molecules to optimize desirable properties such as co@xmath0 selectivity , capture rates , and costs of absorption / desorption cycles.@xcite        a particularly interesting and well - studied example of a mof material is , also known as hkust-1 ( ref .  ) . this material ( )",
    "consists of copper dimers linked by 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate c@xmath3o@xmath4h@xmath1 ( btc ) units .",
    "the structure has a three - dimensional cubic framework with channels of alternating 13.3   and 11.1   cuboctahedral pores connected by 6.4   square windows along 100-type directions , and 5.5   tetrahedral side pockets connected to the 13.3   pores via 3.7   triangular windows.@xcite    as formed in atmospheric conditions ,   contains a significant degree of water .",
    "this water can be removed via heat - treatment under near vacuum,@xcite leaving a structure with partially  exposed \" cu ions@xcite facing the large cuboctahedral pores , allowing for particularly strong interactions with adsorbates at these cu sites .",
    "these exposed ions lead to several potential applications in addition to carbon capture , including catalysis,@xcite hydrogen storage,@xcite storage of other gases such as no,@xcite and gas separation.@xcite    dry   has a 2 uptake of as much as 19.8 weight  % at atmospheric pressure,@xcite and a high selectivity of 2 over 2.@xcite the situation of hydrated   is interesting . up to about one 2o per cu site",
    ", there is theoretical and experimental evidence for a slight increase in 2 uptake.@xcite for water concentrations greater than about one 2o per cu , a situation which we call here  highly - hydrated \" , the 2 uptake is reduced.@xcite at high - enough concentrations of 2o ,  loses almost all of its 2 capacity.@xcite the last fact likely prevents the use of  as a material for post - combustion carbon capture , as flue gases in coal - burning plants contain significant water vapor.@xcite in some mofs , water can even break down the structure completely.@xcite    in spite of the importance of the highly - hydrated state of  for its performance , little is known about the structure of water in this state .",
    "absorption isotherm measurements@xcite show that as much as 32 to 40 mol kg@xmath5 of water can be absorbed into .",
    "assuming an ideal pore structure , this corresponds to 6.5 to 8.0 2o per cu .",
    "an nmr study@xcite suggests that the state of highly - hydrated   has one water molecule bound to each cu in equilibrium with fluid water in the remaining pore volume .",
    "a recent x - ray powder diffraction refinement,@xcite on the other hand , shows evidence for 2.3 bound water molecules per cu atom , in three different partially occupied binding sites , although it was not possible to determine the hydrogen positions for these water molecules .",
    "previous electronic structure calculations and molecular simulations have generally investigated the structure of 2o in   only up to one 2o per cu ion,@xcite in which case one water molecule binds to each cu position , with the water oxygen atom ( ) closest to the cu . in this work ,",
    "we use density functional theory at the  meta - gga + u \" level to investigate the structure of water absorption in cu - btc up to 3.5 2o per cu .",
    "first principles density functional theory calculations , as encoded in the vasp software  ( ) , were used to calculate the relaxed configurations investigated here and their electronic structures .",
    "all calculations were performed for a primitive cell of  containing 156 framework atoms plus any h@xmath0o adsorbates . because of the large cell , only a single k - point at the origin was used .",
    "the planewave cutoff was 500 ev for all calculations .",
    "van der waals forces were treated using the  dft - d2 \" approximation of grimme,@xcite and were included in all calculations .",
    ".total binding energies of water dimers and hexamers ( in ev ) .",
    "vasp results are compared with benchmark gaussian results .",
    "the gaussian results show the average and ( in parenthesis , with units of the least significant digit ) root mean square deviation for three different highly - converged basis sets,@xcite as tabulated in ref .  .",
    "only the electronic contribution to binding energy is included . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the binding energy per water molecule for one 2o  attached to each cu site is -0.52  ev , almost identical to that for an isolated 2o  molecule (  ) . in the highly - hydrated state configurations ,",
    "the magnitude of the binding energy per water molecule is even larger .",
    "where does this enhanced stability come from ? to determine this , we broke down the binding energy of each model into three parts : intracluster energy ; cluster - framework van der waals energy ( vdw ) , and the excess part , due to chemical interaction of the cluster with the framework .",
    "the intracluster binding energy was calculated by removing the framework and performing a dft energy calculation on just the cluster .",
    "the remaining contribution to the binding energy was then broken down into vdw and chemical contributions as described above for the single molecule case . as a control",
    ", we also took a 28-molecule water cluster , moved it to the medium 11   pore , naming this model  model-28mp \" , fully relaxed the system ( ) , and broke down its energy into components .",
    "the results are shown in .        from",
    ", the primary cause for the high stability of water clusters in  is the _ combination _ of intracluster ( hydrogen bonding ) interactions within each cluster and chemical interactions between the cluster and the framework , particularly when each exposed cu site inside the large pore  sees \" a molecule belonging to a cluster .",
    "the medium pores lack exposed cu sites , and the model 28-mp cluster in this pore has almost zero chemical interaction with the framework . comparing model 28-mp and model 28 ,",
    "the intracluster interactions are stronger in the medium pore , but the overall binding energy of 28 water molecules is about 1.8 ev more stable inside the large pore , secondary influences on water cluster stability in  include van der waals interactions and secondary chemical interactions .",
    "secondary chemical interactions results from two sources : enhancement of 2o-2o binding under an electric field@xcite ( generated by the exposed cu ions ) , and additional h - bonding of 2o  h to o in the framework itself , seen in ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "all calculations were performed at zero temperature , and do not include thermal motion . given that water is a liquid at room temperature , what can we say about the nature of the water in highly - hydrated   at room temperature ? here , we refer to a recent molecular dynamics simulation@xcite on  mil-53 \" , a cr - based mof with a smaller unit cell than .",
    "they found , at room temperature , dynamic hydrogen bonds , one @xmath6 ( quasi)-statically bound to each exposed hydroxyl unit , and additional water molecules that move fluidly .",
    "this is akin to the picture discussed in an nmr study on , @xcite where they conclude that there are two types of water molecules : one type bound to cu , and the other fluid .",
    "the experimental x - ray powder diffraction refinement of , showing 2.3 @xmath6 binding sites per cu,@xcite suggests that more water molecules are ( quasi)-static than just those immediately bound to the cu , but that any additional water molecules in the remaining pore space may be fluid as their oxygen positions are not resolved .",
    "clearly , further theoretical and experimental studies on the dynamics of water in  are needed .",
    "it would be useful to perform molecular dynamics studies of 2o  in .",
    "the relevant time scale for hydrogen bonding rearrangements in 2o  is of order picoseconds ( see _ e.g _ ref .  ) and measurements of liquid water diffusion rates@xcite imply that -  rearrangements occur on the scale of tens of picoseconds .",
    "these time scales are too long for _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics to be practical ; classical molecular dynamics on a suitable force - field model are required .",
    "on the experimental side , diffraction studies at low temperatures , where the water is completely frozen , would be particularly useful .",
    "do our results provide guidance for the design of a mof with weaker water binding , one that might be more useful for 2 capture from a moist gas mixture ?",
    "in the following , we speculate that the distance separating the metal ions in a mof with exposed metal ions is one factor that may affect the selectivity of 2o versus other sorbates . for  hydrated with one water per",
    "cu ion ( ( a ) ) , the closest -  distance is 5.2   , which coincides with the third - neighbor peak in the o - o pair distribution function of water ice.@xcite on the other hand , an o - o distance of 5.8   , is near a minimum of the o - o pair distribution function for both ice and liquid water.@xcite if one could synthesize a mof with open metal sites such that the equilibrium -  distance between water molecule bound to adjacent metal ions were 5.8   , the formation of water clusters that bridge this unfavorable -  distance might be inhibited , leading to a more favorable balance between 2 and water sorption .",
    "meta - gga+u density functional theory calculations are shown to reproduce the experimental structure of dry  and also to accurately give the interaction energies of small water clusters . applying these calculations to models for hydrated , we find that hydrogen - bonded water clusters have their stability enhanced primarily by interactions with the exposed metal ions , and secondarily by van der waals interactions , electric field enhancement of water - water bonding , and hydrogen bonding of water to framework oxygens .",
    "this explains the great affinity of water for  and related metal - organic frameworks .",
