    "virtual knot theory , discovered by kauffman  @xcite , is a nontrivial extension of classical knot theory .",

    "* theorem 1.b ) .",
    "their result served to motivate many subsequent developments , because it predicted that many classical knot and link invariants can be extended to virtual knots and links .",
    "this result from  @xcite was originally deduced from the classical waldhausen s theorem  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.5 ) , but it can also be derived from kuperberg s theorem  @xcite . in the latter formulation ,",
    "one represents virtual knots geometrically as knots in thickened surfaces up to stable equivalence , and kuperberg s theorem tells us that the minimal genus representative is unique up to diffeomorphism .",
    "concordance of virtual knots has recently become an area of active interest , and many basic questions are still open . one important question , which was raised both by turaev  ( * ? ? ? * section 2.2 ) and by kauffman  @xcite , is the following : _ if two classical knots are concordant as virtual ones , are they concordant in the usual sense ? _ our main result gives an affirmative answer to this question .",
    "if two classical knots are concordant as virtual knots , then they are also concordant as classical knots .",
    "this result can be viewed as the analogue in concordance of the earlier result of goussarov , polyak , and viro  @xcite , and consequently we hope that it will stimulate further research on the problem of extending concordance invariants from the classical to the virtual setting .",
    "in fact , there are already exciting new developments along these lines , for instance the extension of the rasmussen @xmath1-invariant to virtual knots given by dye , kaestner , and kauffman  @xcite .",
    "we give a brief overview of the rest of the paper . in section  [ section2 ] ,",
    "we introduce virtual knots as knots in thickened surfaces up to stable equivalence .",
    "we recall turaev s definition of virtual knot concordance in subsection  [ subsection2 - 2 ] , and we state and prove our main result in subsection  [ subsection2 - 3 ] . in section [ section3 ] , we introduce long virtual knots and construct the _ virtual knot concordance group _ @xmath2 we show that a long virtual knot @xmath0 is virtually slice if and only if its closure @xmath3 is , and we use it to deduce injectivity of the natural homomorphism @xmath4 from the classical concordance group to the virtual concordance group .    all manifolds are assumed smooth and all knots are assumed oriented . throughout the paper , we work with smooth concordance .",
    "in this section , we introduce stable equivalence of knots in thickened surfaces and use them to define virtual knots .",
    "this gives rise to a natural notion of concordance for virtual knots , which allows for a bordism between the two surfaces whose thickenings contain representatives of the two virtual knots , and requires also an embedded annulus cobounding the two knots .",
    "it will be convenient for us to regard virtual knots geometrically as knots in thickened surfaces , and we take a moment to explain this point of view .    a _ thickened surface _  @xmath5 is a product of a closed , connected , oriented surface  @xmath6 with the interval  @xmath7 $ ] .",

    "for the sake of completeness , we relate the geometric definition of virtual knots to the usual diagrammatic definition .",

    "two virtual knot diagrams are equivalent if they are related by planar isotopies and _ generalised reidemeister moves_. these consist of the three usual reidemeister moves together with three additional moves just like the usual reidemeister moves but with only virtual crossings , and one more move called the mixed move which is depicted in figure  [ mm ] .",
    "a virtual knot is defined to be an equivalence class of virtual knot diagrams , and virtual links are defined similarly as equivalence classes of virtual link diagrams .        given a virtual knot diagram  @xmath35 of a virtual knot  @xmath0 , there is a canonical surface  @xmath6 called the carter surface constructed from @xmath35 as follows  @xcite : attach two intersecting bands at every classical crossing and two non - intersecting bands at every virtual crossing as in figure  [ band - surface ] .",
    "attaching non - intersecting and non - twisted bands along the remaining arcs of @xmath35 , and filling in all boundary components with 2-disks , we obtain a closed oriented surface  @xmath6 whose thickening  @xmath5 contains a representative of @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath0 be a knot in a thickened surface @xmath5 and @xmath36 a neighbourhood of the image of @xmath0 under projection @xmath37 .",

    "this virtual knot diagram @xmath35 depends on the choice of immersion @xmath39 , but any two such diagrams are equivalent via detour moves  @xcite .",
    "this establishes a one - to - one correspondence between virtual knot diagrams modulo the generalised reidemeister moves and knots in thickened surfaces up to stable equivalence  @xcite .          in this section , we define concordance and sliceness for virtual knots in terms of their representative knots in thickened surfaces .",
    "we follow turaev  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1 ) in defining virtual knot concordance .",
    "if @xmath0 is an oriented knot in a thickened surface @xmath5 , its reverse is the knot @xmath40 obtained by changing the orientation of @xmath0 , and its mirror image is the knot @xmath41 obtained by changing the orientation of @xmath5 .",
    "these operations commute with one another , and we use @xmath42 to denote the knot obtained by taking the mirror image of the reverse knot .

    "filling them in with 2-disks gives a slice disk for @xmath0 , showing that the kishino knot is virtually slice .         although it is not immediately obvious , kauffman s diagramatic notion of virtual concordance is equivalent to definition  [ defn : virtualslice ] .",
