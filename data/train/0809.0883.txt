    "until recently , quasars have typically been selected as point - like objects with colors bluer than stars ( e.g. u @xmath14 b @xmath2 -0.44 , schmidt & green 1983 ) .",
    "this limited the possible spectral energy diagrams ( seds ) that known quasars could have .",
    "a composite sed shows that quasars blue colors are due to the ` big blue bump ' ( bbb ) continuum feature that dominates the optical and uv spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , surveys using different selection mechanisms discovered that quasars can have red colors as well , indicating a diminished or missing bbb .",
    "while in many cases , this reddening is due to dust obscuration , some cases may be due to changes in the accretion disk thought to power the optical / uv continuum .",
    "we identify such a population in this paper .",
    "red quasars were first discovered in the @xcite sample of radio - loud quasars .",
    "@xcite suggested dust - reddening as the cause of the red @xmath15 colors and estimated that red colors could cause as much as 80% of the quasar population to go undetected in existing optical surveys .",
    "some 200 members of a new population of red , radio - quiet quasars were discovered in the near - infrared ( 1 - 2 @xmath16 m ) with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) by @xcite .",
    "the space density of the red 2mass quasars was found to be at least equal to that of optical and uv - selected quasars . @xcite",
    "also suggested dust - reddening to explain the red colors of the 2mass red quasars because the near - ir color distribution is consistent with a reddening of @xmath17 = 1 - 5 magnitudes .",
    "in addition , @xmath1810% of the predominantly radio - quiet sample is highly polarized ( @xmath19 ) @xcite . supporting this conclusion , chandra and xmm - newton observations of red 2mass agn find spectra that are either unusually hard or absorbed by n@xmath9 = 10@xmath20 - 10@xmath12 @xmath21 @xcite .    unlike uv - excess based surveys , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "allows detection of red quasars in the optical band because the algorithm for selecting candidates for spectroscopy uses a four - dimensional multicolor selection criterion @xcite similar to that of the 2df qso redshift survey @xcite .",
    "this allows the sdss to select all objects lying outside of the stellar locus , including atypically red quasars .",
    "@xcite explored the color distribution of sdss quasars and found that while a population of intrinsically red quasars exists , the majority of the red tail of the color distribution is explained by dust reddening . in a later study @xcite ,",
    "the curvatures of the sdss spectra were found to be best - fit by a dust extinction curve similar to that of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) @xcite .",
    "however , only mildly dust - reddened quasars can be detected ( e(b - v ) @xmath2 0.5 ) in the sdss before dust extinction causes them to drop below the detection threshold of the survey @xcite .    while dust - reddening is a common explanation for red colors in quasars , other possible explanations",
    "include : ( 1 ) host galaxy contamination , ( 2 ) absorption by the ly@xmath3 forest , ( 3 ) optical synchrotron emission superimposed on a normal , blue spectrum to create a red spectrum @xcite , and ( 4 ) an intrinsically red continuum .",
    "the redshift selection in this paper minimizes contamination via options ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "x - ray observations used in conjunction with optical information can constrain the amount of intrinsic absorption in a source , thereby allowing an investigation of dust - reddened versus intrinsically red optical continua .",
    "previous studies have found intrinsically red quasar candidates in addition to dust - reddened quasars .",
    "for example , @xcite selected a sample of 12 red quasars from the sdss , but chandra x - ray observations show evidence for nh absorption ( n@xmath22 @xmath21 ) for only 4 of their 12 quasars .",
    "the other seven quasars show no evidence for even moderate intrinsic absorption and three of these show evidence for an intrinsically red optical continuum .    in a similar vein ,",
    "@xcite observed 16 optically - selected , x - ray weak quasars with chandra . while the sample was not selected to be red , the average color of the sample is redder than that of the parent hamburg quasar survey ( @xmath23 1 vs. @xmath23 0.5 ) .",
    "the x - ray weak quasars have a flat average photon index , @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 = -@xmath3 + 1 for f@xmath26 ) and 12 of the 16 quasars have steeper optical - to - x - ray indices than normal .",
    "( the optical - to - x - ray continuum is characterized by @xmath27 = log(f@xmath28/f@xmath29 ) / log(@xmath30/@xmath31 , where f@xmath28 and f@xmath29 are the intrinsic flux densities at 2 kev and 2500 @xmath32 , respectively @xcite . )",
    "while x - ray absorption remains a possibility , @xcite argue that these quasars are intrinsically underluminous in the x - rays . the evidence , however , is not conclusive due to the low signal - to - noise for many of the chandra spectra .",
    "larger surveys including high quality optical and x - ray spectra are now possible with the advent of the sdss and the xmm - newton archive of x - ray observations , both of which cover large areas of the sky .",
    "sdss data can constrain dust - reddening in the optical , while xmm - newton observations constrain absorption in the x - rays . in this paper",
    "we investigate the optical and x - ray properties of 17 red sdss quasars .",
    " 2 introduces the data sources and sample selection and  3 covers the optical and x - ray reduction and data analysis . in  4 , we classify the quasars as dust - reddened , intrinsically red or unclassified , and in  5 we discuss low accretion rates as a possible explanation for the steep optical / uv spectra of intrinsically red quasars .",
    "we assume throughout the paper that h@xmath33 = 70 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the third version of the sdss quasar catalog @xcite is based on data release 3 ( dr3 ) , which covers an area of 5,282 deg@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the quasar catalog contains 46,240 objects from the sdss that have : ( 1 ) 15.0 @xmath37 22.2 ; ( 2 ) m@xmath38 -22.0 ; ( 3 ) at least one emission line with fwhm greater than 1000 km s@xmath5 , or ( 4 ) unambiguous broad absorption line characteristics .",
    "sdss photometry in the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 bands covers 3,250 - 10,000 @xmath32 .",
    "sdss spectroscopy covers 3,800 - 9,200 @xmath32 ( so the @xmath39 band and part of the @xmath43 band lie outside the spectral range ) , with a spectral resolving power of @xmath18 2,000 .",
    "the sdss dr3 quasar catalog overlaps with 1% of the area of archival xmm - newton observations .",
    "xmm - newton imaging is carried out by the three european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) : mos-1 , mos-2 , and pn @xcite .",
    "the xmm - newton telescope is good for retrieving serendipitous x - ray spectra of sdss quasars due to a large collecting area ( 922 @xmath11 for mos and 1,227 @xmath11 for pn at 1 kev ) , large field of view ( 33 x 33 for mos and 27.5 x 27.5 for pn ) , and good spectral resolution ( e/@xmath44e @xmath18 20 - 50 for both mos and pn ) .",
    "the xmm - newton spectral range covers the 0.5 - 12 kev band .",
    "the sdss and xmm - newton archives are well - matched in sensitivity . a source with a 2 - 10 kev flux of 10@xmath45 erg s@xmath5 @xmath21 and a standard radio quiet spectrum ( @xmath25 @xmath18 2.0 ) produces @xmath46 counts in @xmath47 ksec , sufficient for a crude spectral fit . for",
    "a typical value of @xmath48 @xcite , a 10@xmath45 ergs @xmath21 s@xmath5 quasar would have @xmath41 = 19.37 while an x - ray quiet quasar with @xmath49 would have @xmath41 = 15.63 .",
    "both of these magnitudes lie comfortably in the sdss range .",
    "we define our red sample of @xcite quasars lying in xmm - newton fields by selecting the most extreme red colors , @xmath50 . by further restricting our search to moderate redshifts ( 0.9 @xmath2 z @xmath2 2.1 ) , we minimize host galaxy contribution at low redshifts ( z @xmath2 0.5 ) and ly@xmath3 forest absorption at high redshifts ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this selection results in a sample of 17 quasars .",
    "@xcite , hereafter r03 , defines dust - reddened quasars via their relative colors .",
    "relative colors compare a quasar s measured colors with the median colors in its redshift bin , where redshift bin sizes are 0.1 in redshift , so that @xmath52 .",
    "the use of relative colors corrects for the effect of typical emission lines on the photometry in a particular band .",
    "the relative colors of the sdss quasars match a gaussian distribution on the blue side but require the addition of a tail on the red side ( fig . 3 in r03 ) .",
    "r03 identifies quasars belonging to the red tail as @xmath53 , since the @xmath54 color correlates best with the photometric spectral index .",
    "the @xmath54 color has been corrected for an smc - like extinction curve with e(b - v ) = 0.04 , a value typical of high galactic latitudes , for which e(@xmath40 - @xmath42 ) = 0.07 . in practice , this yields a minimum of @xmath55 for the quasars with redshift z@xmath181.5 .",
    "the ( @xmath40 - @xmath42 ) and ( @xmath40 - @xmath41 ) colors behave similarly with redshift ( fig . 2 of r03 ) , and the maximum median color is 0.2 for 1 @xmath2 z @xmath2 2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : color dist ] , we show a histogram of the relative ( @xmath40 - @xmath42 ) colors for our sample . only two have @xmath56 . thus , the @xmath40 - @xmath41 @xmath1 0.5 color selection mimics @xmath57 , though we do not use relative colors .",
    "our red quasar sample is unbiased in x - ray loudness since we do not require x - ray detections for selection . nevertheless , the x - ray detection rates are high : 94% for 2@xmath58 detections ( 16/17 ) and 76% for @xmath59 detections ( 13/17 ) , although most of the quasars have a relatively low x - ray signal - to - noise : 10/17 quasars have s / n @xmath60 .",

    "z @xmath18 1 - 1.5 , the small blue bump reddens the observed @xmath0 colors resulting in similar samples , whether selected by color or color excess .",
    "however , for redshifts z @xmath18 1.5 - 2 , the @xmath0 color decreases ; for this range , selection via color excess would increase the number of quasars with smaller color excesses , thereby possibly increasing the fraction of intrinsically red quasars .",
    "quasars with intrinsically red seds have been discussed before ( e.g. , risaliti et al . 2003 ; hall et al .",
    "2006 , see  1 ) . for example , the intrinsically red quasars found by @xcite do not show absorption in the optical or x - ray continua , yet they also have steep optical slopes ( @xmath165 = -1.0 , @xmath168 = 0.2 ) , determined via fits to the sdss spectra .",
    "intrinsically steep optical power - laws suggest that these quasars have a different continuum emission mechanism from ordinary quasars .",
    "we consider 3 possibilities to explain the red optical power - laws : ( 1 ) strong synchrotron emission visible in the optical , ( 2 ) a high - temperature bbb , which exposes the red power - law that may underlie typical optical emission , or ( 3 ) a low - temperature bbb resulting from a low accretion rate , such that the steep , high - energy tail of the bbb is visible in the optical .      synchrotron radiation could result in a red optical power - law .",

    "first , synchrotron radiation is strongest in the radio , with a turnover frequency at @xmath187 = 10@xmath188 hz @xcite .",
    "therefore , we would expect strong radio emission in all of the intrinsically red quasars , when in fact only one can be classified as radio - loud ( table  [ table : sample ] ) .",
    "second , even if a higher than normal turnover frequency allowed the synchrotron emission to dominate in the optical , the superposition of synchrotron emission on a bbb would result in a ` u'-shaped spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 of francis et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this is not observed in any of the optical spectra .",
    "a red power - law is sometimes proposed to underlie the bbb in other quasars @xcite . if the bbb were removed or diminished , this underlying power - law would be exposed .",
    "one way of `` removing '' the bbb is to shift it to higher temperatures .",

    "the optical power - law slopes are -1.3 and -0.9 , respectively .",
    "re j1034 + 396 is an euv - selected source with an ultrasoft x - ray excess that peaks near 0.4 kev .",
    "the effective maximum temperature of the accretion disk is t @xmath18 10@xmath189 k ( log @xmath19016.8 ) , more than an order of magnitude hotter than typical quasar accretion disk temperatures ( t @xmath18 10@xmath191 k , log @xmath19015.3 , * ? ? ?",
    "the optical spectrum of this source shows no signs of a bbb .",
    "re j2248 - 511 also has a high - energy turnover at around 0.25 kev , but a blackbody is a poor fit to the x - ray data .",
    "the presence of an underlying power - law may be explained by weak synchrotron emission from an associated jet emitting at a large angle to the line of sight .",
    "this synchrotron emission would necessarily be weak for a radio - quiet object , which is why the bbb must be removed or otherwise modified in order for the red power - law to be visible in the optical .",
    "alternatively , unsaturated comptonization of a seed spectrum can produce a power - law over seven decades in frequency ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "assuming a simple model of the accretion disk as a sum of blackbodies , @xcite showed that quasar seds scale homologously with temperature , such that hotter agn have thermal peaks at higher frequencies .",
    "if the local temperature of the disk is due to the release of the gravitational binding energy , then the temperature of the accretion disk scales homologously with the accretion rate .",
    "since the m@xmath172 determines the inner radius of the accretion disk , scaling with black hole mass is model - dependent and non - homologous ; however , simple models show that a less massive black hole will have a hotter maximum effective disk temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , high accretion rates and/or low black hole masses could shift the bbb to higher temperatures / energies .",
    "neither high accretion rates nor low black hole masses are observed in the intrinsically red quasars (  4.6 ) , but since the sdss / xmm red quasars have relatively high redshifts ( z @xmath18 1 - 2 ) , a soft x - ray turnover similar to that found in the @xcite objects would be shifted to @xmath180.4 kev/(1+z ) = 0.1 - 0.2 kev .",
    "this turnover would lie below the observed xmm - epic energy band ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) .",
    "a hidden bbb in the euv or soft x - rays would increase the bolometric luminosity , thereby increasing the accretion rates .",
    "however , an increase in the ionizing continuum would mean that the black hole mass calculations are underestimates . since the effective maximum disk temperature goes roughly as t @xmath166 ( @xmath192m@xmath193 ) , a nls1 ( @xmath2m@xmath194 @xmath18 10@xmath195 m@xmath196 , grupe & mathur 2004 ) can achieve an effective maximum disk temperature of 10@xmath189 k at normal accretion rates , but highly super - eddington conditions ( l / l@xmath197 ) are required for a quasar with m@xmath198m@xmath196 to reach the same temperature . if the black hole masses are underestimates , then even higher accretion rates are required .",
    "therefore , a high - temperature bbb is unlikely to explain the intrinsically red quasars .",

    "<S> these 7 quasars have unusually broad mgii emission lines ( @xmath2fwhm@xmath4=10,500 km s@xmath5 ) , moderately flat , but unabsorbed x - ray spectra ( @xmath6=1.66@xmath70.08 ) , and low accretion rates ( @xmath8 0.01 ) . </S>",
