    "relays are often used to aid communications , not only to improve the quality of service ( qos ) of the user pairs , which have weak direct links due to poor channel conditions , but also to increase the multiplexing gain of the network @xcite . among various relay transmit schemes ,",

    "we are able to solve ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) efficiently , and construct @xmath76 from @xmath114 .    for a precoder @xmath77 ,",

    "however as we have separated the variables into more than two parts , there is no theoretical guarantee that the algorithm converges to a stationary point of ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) .",
    "[ re : re1 ] sharing similar expression of objective function , the algorithm here for tstinr is also applicable to the tlin model in @xcite .",
    "the objective function of ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) is the linear combination of the total leakage interference plus noise @xmath121 and the desired signal power @xmath122 , and the parameter @xmath67 balances their weights , while the model tlin in @xcite only minimizes @xmath121 . from the sum rate point of view , our tstinr model is better motivated .",
    "this is verified by simulation results , where significant improvement of system sum rate by tstinr compared to tlin is shown .",
    "a similar objective function has been discussed in @xcite , where the desired signal power and the leakage interference are combined and optimized . in that case",
    "the leakage interference is aimed to be aligned perfectly , thus the parameter @xmath67 in @xcite approaches to infinity to satisfy the interference alignment constraint . in our paper , @xmath121 might not be reduced to zero , and consequently @xmath67 might not grow to infinity . in @xcite , @xmath67 is enlarged when the interference does not have sufficient reduction , which is different from the update strategy here .      in this subsection",
    ", we extend our new tstinr model , as well as the tlin and wmmse model in @xcite , to the ones with individual user and individual relay fixed transmit power constraints .      with individual user and individual relay fixed transmit power constraints ,",
    "the tstinr model becomes :    @xmath123 assume there is a preprocess to carefully select active relays in the communication stage .",
    "here we require all the users and relays to transmit signals with fixed power .",
    "the difference from ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) is that , the relay sum power constraint is replaced by @xmath20 individual power constraints for each relay .",

    "the extension of our low complexity algorithm to constraints with power control is ongoing and future work .",

    "although the models with power control constraints are more general and practical , the application of sqp method saves computational complexity . even with fixed power constraints , our tstinr model performs better than the wmmse model with power control constraints in medium to high snr scenarios , as shown in section [ sec : sec3 ] .",
    "in this section , we study the multiple data stream model , with the purpose to maximize the system sum rate . it is pointed out in @xcite that multiple data streams , corresponding to multiple dofs , help to increase the capacity of single - hop network in medium to high snr .",

    "<S> computational complexity analysis shows that our proposed algorithm for tstinr has lower complexity than the existing weighted minimum mean square error ( wmmse ) algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze and confirm by simulations that the tstinr , wmmse and the total leakage interference plus noise ( tlin ) minimization models with per user and total relay sum power constraints can only transmit a single data stream for each user . </S>",
    "<S> thus we propose a novel multiple stream tstinr model with requirement of orthogonal columns for precoders , in order to support multiple data streams and thus utilize higher degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> multiple data streams and larger multiplexing gains are guaranteed . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show that for single stream models , our tstinr algorithm outperforms the tlin algorithm generally and outperforms wmmse in medium to high signal - to - noise - ratio scenarios ; the system sum rate significantly benefits from multiple data streams in medium to high snr scenarios .    </S>",
