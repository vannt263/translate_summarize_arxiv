    "high - precision radial velocity measurements of nearby stars resulted in the detections of more than 100 planetary systems ( http:@xmath1cfa-www.harvard.edu/planets ) . besides the radial velocity method , planets can also be detected and characterized by using various other methods .",
    "these methods include the pulsar timing analysis , direct imaging , accurate measurement of astrometric displacement , planetary transit , and microlensing ( see the review of perryman 2000 ) .",
    "however , all these methods except the microlensing method can be used to detect only planets which are gravitationally bound to their parent stars .",
    "theories about the planet formation indicate that planets often do not stay in the same orbit where they were formed .",
    "dynamical interactions with either a massive planetesimal disk @xcite or the protoplanetary nebular gas @xcite can result in inward migration of planets . on the other hand , gravitational interactions with other planet members @xcite or neighboring stars @xcite can result in the disruption of the planetary system and thus ejection of planets .",
    "the latter process could lead to a population of free - floating planets .",
    "microlensing can be occurred by a low - mass object and thus free - floating planets can be , in principle , searched for by detecting short - duration lensing - induced light variations of background stars caused by the planets . however",
    ", this method has not been used due to technical difficulties .",
    "these difficulties arise because of the rarity of lensing events combined with the short durations of planetary events . at",
    "any given time , only a few out of @xmath2 galactic bulge stars undergo microlensing with their fluxes magnified enough for detection and a small fraction of those microlensed stars are expected to be lensed by planetary masses .",
    "in addition , events produced by planetary lenses last only a short duration of @xmath3 day even for an event caused by a giant planet ( with a mass @xmath4 ) and the duration decreases in proportional to the square root of the lens mass .",
    "therefore , implementing the microlensing method to search for free - floating planets requires a massive survey for a large number of stars with a very high monitoring frequency .",
    "several groups have been previously carried out and are currently performing lensing surveys @xcite , but the typical monitoring frequency of these experiments is at most several times per day , which is far too low to detect events caused free - floating planets . to increase the monitoring frequency ,",
    "the experiments are employing early warning systems @xcite to issue alerts of ongoing events detected in the early stage of lensing magnification and follow - up observation programs @xcite to intensively monitor the alerted events hoping to detect short - duration planetary signals on the top of the lensing light curve produced by the parent star .",
    "however , planets detectable from this type of strategy are also bound planets like the ones detectable from other planet search methods",
    ".    however , the situation will greatly change with the advent of future lensing surveys with very high monitoring frequencies .",
    "actually , several such experiments in space and on the ground were proposed .",
    "the space - based gest mission , proposed to nasa by @xcite , is designed to continuously monitor @xmath5 galactic bulge main - sequence stars with a frequency of several times per hour by using a 12 m aperture space telescope .",
    "studies about the scientific outcome from a ground - based high - frequency lensing experiment using four 2 m - class telescopes located at good seeing sites around the world and equipped with large format ccd cameras are in progress @xcite . from detailed simulations of galactic bulge events detectable from the space observation by using the gest",
    ", @xcite estimated that the total number of detections of events caused by free - floating planets during the life time of the gest mission ( @xmath6 yrs ) would be @xmath7 for earth - mass planets and",
    "@xmath8 for giant planets under the assumption that one planet was ejected for each star .    however , the microlensing method is seriously flawed by the fact that the detected planet s mass can not be uniquely determined .",
    "this defect arises because among the three lensing observables related to the physical parameters of the lens , the einstein time scale @xmath9 , the angular einstein ring radius @xmath10 , and the projected einstein radius onto the plane of the observer @xmath11 , only @xmath9 is routinely measured from the lensing light curve .",
    "these three observables are related to the mass of the lens ( @xmath12 ) , relative source - lens parallax ( @xmath13 $ ] , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the distances to the lens and source , respectively ) , and proper motion ( @xmath16 ) by @xcite @xmath17 due to the fact that @xmath9 results from the combination of @xmath12 , @xmath18 , and @xmath16 , short durations of events do not guarantee the events are caused by planets because they can be produced by low - mass stars or brown dwarfs with exceptionally high proper motions or very small einstein ring radii . as a result ,",
    "even if a large number of short - duration events were detected by future lensing surveys , they could not be definitely identified as planetary events . to isolate events caused by free - floating planets and",
    "determine their masses , it is required to measure the other observables of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( see   2 for the detailed description about the methods to measure these quantities ) .",
    "once @xmath10 and @xmath11 are measured , the lens mass is uniquely determined by @xmath19    recently , @xcite pointed out that the masses of _ bound _ earth - mass planets could be measured by combining a gest - type satellite with ground - based observations .",
    "they showed that the proper motions of these events can be measured by analyzing the planet - induced perturbations in lensing light curves observed from space .",
    "they also showed that if the satellite is placed in an l2 orbit , the earth - satellite baseline is sufficient enough to measure lens parallaxes . in this paper , we show that a similar observational setup proposed by @xcite can also be used for the mass determinations of free - floating planets , which are the population of planets that have not been previously probed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   2",
    ", we describe the methods of @xmath11 and @xmath10 measurements and explain the reasons for the difficulties in measuring these quantities for events caused by stellar mass lenses . in   3 , we illustrate the relative easiness of @xmath11 and @xmath10 measurements for events caused by low - mass lenses such as free - floating planets . in   4 , we estimate the mass range over which the proposed mass determination method is sensitive by estimating the uncertainties of the recovered lens masses under the observational setup proposed by @xcite . in   5 , we briefly discuss several problems of the proposed observational setup .",
    "we conclude in   6 .",
    "a microlensing event occurs when a compact massive object ( lens ) approaches very close to the observer s line of sight toward a background star ( source ) . due to the lensing - induced magnification and the varying lens - source separation caused by the relative proper motion ,",
    "the source star flux changes with time . for an event involved with a point source ,",
    "the magnification of the source star flux varies with time by @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the lens - source separation vector normalized by @xmath10 , @xmath22 is the closest lens - source separation in units of @xmath10 ( impact parameter ) , @xmath23 is the time at that moment ( time of maximum magnification ) , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the unit vectors parallel with and normal to the direction of the lens - source motion , respectively . among the three lensing parameters of a point - source event ( @xmath23 , @xmath22 and @xmath9 ) , the first two tell nothing about the lens and the third is related to @xmath12 , @xmath18 , and @xmath16 in a complicated way presented in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) . to fully break the lens parameter degeneracy ,",
    "two additional pieces of information of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are needed .",
    "the angular einstein ring radius can be measured by scaling @xmath10 against some known `` standard angular rulers '' on the source plane ( the plane perpendicular to the line of sight toward the source at the position of the source ) .",
    "the most ubiquitous standard ruler is the source star itself .",
    "if the lens passes close enough to the source , the source star can no longer be approximated as a point source . in this case ,",
    "different parts on the source star surface are magnified by different amounts due to the difference in separation from the lens , and the resulting light curve deviates from that of a point source event ; finite source effect @xcite . by measuring the deviation caused by the finite source effect",
    ", one can measure the relative source size normalized by the angular einstein ring radius , @xmath26 ( normalized source radius ) , where @xmath27 is the angular radius of the source star . since",
    "@xmath27 can be estimated from the position of the source star on a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) relative to the center of red clump giants , whose dereddened and calibrated position on the cmd is well known @xcite , the angular einstein ring radius is determined by @xmath28 @xcite .    the projected einstein ring radius can be measured by scaling @xmath11 against some known `` standard physical rulers '' on the plane of the observer ( the plane perpendicular to the line of sight toward the source at the position of the observer ) .",
    "such a standard ruler is provided by observing an event at two different locations .",
    "if an event is seen by two observers located at different locations , the source star position with respect to the lens is different .",
    "the amount of the normalized difference between the source positions is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the separation vector between the two observers projected onto the observer plane .",
    "then , if @xmath31 is large enough , the light curves of the event seen from the two observers will exhibit noticeable differences ; parallax effect @xcite . by measuring the difference in impact parameters , @xmath32 , and the difference in times of maximum magnification , @xmath33 , between the light curves as seen from the two observers",
    ", one can measure @xmath34 , and so @xmath11 ( with the known separation vector @xmath30 ) .",
    "however , determining the lens masses by using the mentioned standard rulers for events caused by stellar mass lenses was not easy .",
    "this is because the einstein ring radii of these events are much larger than the sizes of the rulers . for galactic bulge events , the sizes of @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "are @xmath35 and @xmath36 noticeable light curve deviations caused by the finite source effect are produced only when the lens - source separation is equivalent to or less than the source radius ( see figure [ f2 ] ) . however , the normalized source radius of a typical bulge event caused by a stellar mass lens with @xmath37 located at @xmath38 is merely @xmath39 for a main - sequence star ( with a physical radius of @xmath40 and an angular size of @xmath41arcsec at @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 even for a clump giant star ( with @xmath44 and @xmath45arcsec ) .",
    "this implies that close lens - source approach enough to produce noticeable light curve deviations caused by the finite source effect occurs very rarely and thus one can measure @xmath10 only for a very small fraction of events .",
    "in addition , the typical projected einstein ring radius for these events is @xmath46 , and thus measurement of @xmath11 is impossible with an earth - scale baseline .",
    "days ) , it is possible to measure @xmath11 because the location of the observer changes considerably during the event because of the orbital motion of the earth around the sun . ]",
    "one may think an appropriate baseline can be provided by a satellite with a heliocentric orbit . however , the problem of this solution is that transmission of a huge amount of data from the satellite is difficult with the current technology .",
    "in addition , even if the technical problem is resolved and events are observed from the earth and the satellite , still @xmath11 can not be uniquely determined because of the inherent degeneracy in @xmath47 .",
    "this degeneracy arises because for a given pair of light curves observed from the two different locations there can be two possible values of @xmath48 depending on whether the source star trajectories as seen from the earth and the satellite are on the same or opposite sides with respect to the lens , causing a two - fold degeneracy in the determined value of @xmath11 @xcite . to lift this degeneracy",
    ", one needs a second satellite . as a result , @xmath49 and @xmath11",
    "have been measured for only a handful number of events each out of the more than 1000 events detected so far [ @xcite for @xmath49 measurements and @xcite for @xmath11 measurements ] , and for only a single event both @xmath10 and @xmath11 have been measured @xcite .",
    "are measured are caustic - crossing binary lens events , which comprise only a small fraction of the total number of events .",
    "we also note that all of the events with known parallaxes are very long time - scale events , which comprise also a small fraction of the total number of events . ]",
    "unlike events caused by stellar mass lenses , it is possible to measure both @xmath11 and @xmath10 for a substantial fraction of events caused by free - floating planets .",
    "this is because the einstein ring radii of these events are much smaller than those of the events produced by stellar mass lenses .",
    "then , the sizes of the angular and physical standard rulers on the source and observer planes compared to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , are no longer negligible , and thus the events are more susceptible to both the finite - source and parallax effects .      if an event caused by a free - floating planet is observed simultaneously from the earth and a satellite located at a distance of @xmath50 au , corresponding to the distance to a satellite located in the l2 orbit , the expected displacement between the locations of the source caused by the parallax effect for a typical bulge event ( with @xmath51 kpc and @xmath52 kpc ) would be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the projection factor .",
    "although this shift is significantly larger than the shift expected from the event caused by a stellar mass lens , it is still small compared to @xmath10 . then , one may question whether the light curves observed from the earth and the satellite can exhibit noticeable differences with such a small displacement .    for high magnification events , however , the light curve difference induced by the parallax effect can be large even with a small amount of @xmath48 .",
    "the reason can be analytically explained as follows . differentiating the expression of the magnification in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) with respect to @xmath55 yields @xmath56 then the fractional difference between the light curves seen from the earth and the satellite is computed by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 represent the magnifications measured from the earth and the satellite , respectively . for a high magnification event ( @xmath60 ) , equation ( [ eq9 ] )",
    "is simplified into the form @xmath61 from equation ( [ eq10 ] ) , one finds that even with a small amount of @xmath48 , the deviation can be large for high magnification events .",
    "for example , the fractional difference between the light curves caused by the source star s positional displacement of @xmath62 is @xmath63 for events with @xmath64 , implying that the difference can be measured for a significant fraction of events caused by free - floating planets .",
    "-0.6 cm    the feasibility of parallax measurements for high magnification events is illustrated in figure [ f1 ] , where we present light curves of an example planetary event observed from the earth ( solid curve ) and a satellite ( dotted curves ) .",
    "the event as seen from the earth has an impact parameter of @xmath65 and the source position as seen from the satellite is slightly displaced by @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( and thus @xmath68 ) .",
    "the inset on the left corner of the upper panel shows the geometry of the lens system , where the dashed circle represents the einstein ring and the solid and dotted straight lines represent the source star trajectories as seen from the earth and the satellite , respectively , with respect to the lens ( marked by a small filled dot at the center of the einstein ring ) .",
    "the inset on the right corner shows the blowup of the region enclosed by a square in the left - side inset .",
    "the three dots represent the source locations at the moment when the magnification of the event seen from the earth is maximum , i.e.  @xmath69 .",
    "the lower panel shows the fractional deviation @xmath70 .",
    "one finds that even with a very small displacement of the source trajectory , the deviation is as large as @xmath71 as predicted by equation ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "we note that the parallax of the event caused by a free - floating planet does not suffer from the degeneracy mentioned in ",
    "this is because the source trajectory seen from the earth and the satellite are nearly always located on the same side with respect to the lens due to the small value of @xmath48 expected for typical planetary events .",
    "-0.7 cm    -0.9 cm      high - magnification planetary events are susceptible not only to the parallax effect but also to the finite source effect . the light curve affected by the finite source effect",
    "is given by the intensity - weighted magnification averaged over the source flux .",
    "under the assumption of a uniform source brightness , the magnification of an event affected by the finite source effect is expressed by @xmath72 , \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 represents the normalized separation between the lens and the center of the source star , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 represent the position vector and the position angle of a point on the source star surface with respect to the source star s center , respectively . in the case of a high magnification event , for which the finite source effect is important , the magnification is approximated by @xmath76 using equations ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) , one finds the expression for the ratio between the magnifications with and without the finite source effect , i.e. @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "then , the fractional deviation caused by the finite source effect is expressed in terms of the function @xmath79 as @xmath80    in figure [ f2 ] , we present the fractional deviation caused by the finite source effect as a function of @xmath81 . from the curve , one finds that if the lens approaches the source star closer than @xmath82 and @xmath83 times of the source star radius , the deviations become @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . the normalized angular radius of a galactic bulge main - sequence source star ( with a physical size of @xmath40 and an angular size of 0.6 @xmath86arcsec at @xmath42 ) , which is the main monitoring target of the gest mission , is @xmath87 .",
    "then , with a detection condition of @xmath88 , the deviation can be detected for events with @xmath89 .",
    "note that while one needs both light curves obtained from the earth and the satellite for @xmath11 measurement , @xmath10 can be measured from a single light curve obtained from space observation with exquisite photometry .",
    "as the mass of the lens decreases , the resulting event becomes more susceptible to the parallax effect for a given baseline and to the finite source effect for a given source radius .",
    "however , if the lens mass is too small , the detection efficiency of the deviation will sharply drop and the uncertainty of the determined lens mass will become large due to not - enough coverage of the deviation . in this section ,",
    "we estimate the lens mass range over which the proposed method is sensitive .",
    "for this , we estimate the uncertainties of @xmath11 and @xmath10 expected under the observational setup proposed by @xcite .    to determine the uncertainties of @xmath11 and @xmath10 , we first estimate the uncertainties of the lensing parameters .",
    "we estimate these uncertainties by computing the curvature matrix of @xmath90 surface , @xmath91 . for the case of a microlensing light curve ,",
    "the curvature matrix is defined by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the number of observations , @xmath94 is the observed flux for each measurement , @xmath95 are the lensing parameters , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the fluxes of the lensed source star and blended light , and @xmath98 is the photometric uncertainty of each measurement .",
    "we note that in addition to the lensing parameters of a point - source event , two additional parameters of @xmath97 and @xmath99 are included to account for the blending and finite source effects .",
    "then , the uncertainties of the individual lensing parameters correspond to the diagonal components of the inverse curvature matrix ( covariance matrix @xmath100 , where @xmath101 ) , i.e. @xmath102    the error analysis is done for events with a source and a lens located at 8 kpc and 6 kpc , respectively , and varying the lens mass and @xmath22 .",
    "the assumed relative proper motion is @xmath103 mas / yr ( corresponding to the relative lens - source transverse speed of @xmath104 ) .",
    "then , the corresponding event time scale is @xmath105 .",
    "the proposed gest mission will take images of galactic bulge main - sequence stars with 2 min exposure and coadd 5 images to yield 10 min exposure @xcite .",
    "following the specification of the gest mission , we assume that each combined image is obtained every 20 min ( corresponding to a monitoring frequency of 72/day ) considering the data readout time .",
    "we also assume a similar monitoring frequency for the ground observation .",
    "we assume each event is observed during @xmath106 . for the photometric uncertainties , we assume 1% and 2% photometry for the space and ground observations , respectively .",
    "we also assume that blended light comprises 0% ( no blending ) and 30% of the observed flux for the space and ground observations , respectively .",
    "the source star is assumed to have a solar radius .",
    "once @xmath107 expected from the space and ground observations are determined , the uncertainty of the source trajectory displacement ( @xmath48 ) is computed according to error propagation analysis by @xmath108^{1/2 }   \\over   \\delta u } , \\label{eq17}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the uncertainties of the differences between the @xmath111 s and @xmath22 s measured from the two light curves obtained from the space and ground observations . to prevent confusion in notations , we note that `` @xmath112 '' is used to denote the measurement uncertainty , while `` @xmath113 '' is used to denote the difference in lensing parameters determined from the light curves obtained from the space and ground observations .",
    "the uncertainties @xmath109 and @xmath110 are computed from @xmath107 s estimated from curvature matrix analysis by @xmath114   \\left({\\delta t_0 \\over { t_{\\rm e } } } \\right)^2 , \\cr   & \\sigma_{\\delta u_0}^2   \\sim ( \\sigma_{u_0})_{sat}^2 +   ( \\sigma_{u_0})^2_\\oplus , \\cr } \\label{eq18}\\ ] ] where the subscripts `` _ sat _ '' and `` @xmath115 '' are used to denote uncertainties from space and ground measurements , respectively . the first relation in equation ( [ eq18 ] ) is obtained under the assumption that the uncertainty of @xmath116 is dominated by @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118 . to account for the projection effect of the earth - satellite separation ,",
    "we assume @xmath119 au and the displacement vector of the tested event is assumed to have equal @xmath120 and @xmath121 components , i.e.  @xmath122 .",
    "since the normalized source star radius can be determined from the light curve observed from space alone , its uncertainty is given simply by @xmath123 once @xmath124 and @xmath125 are determined , the fractional uncertainties of @xmath11 , @xmath10 , and the resulting lens mass are obtained by @xmath126^{1/2}. \\cr } \\label{eq20}\\ ] ]    -0.2 cm    -0.3 cm    in figure 3 , we present the estimated uncertainties for @xmath11 ( upper panel ) , @xmath10 ( middle panel ) , and the lens mass ( lower panel ) as contours maps in the parameters space of @xmath127 . in each map , contours are drawn at the levels of the fractional uncertainties of 10% , 30% , 50% , and 90% . from the figure , one finds that the proposed method is most sensitive to planets with masses ranging from @xmath128 to several jupiter masses .",
    "one also finds that while @xmath129 for a given value of @xmath22 decreases with the decrease of the lens mass until the lens mass is @xmath130 ( equivalent to the mass of an earth - mass planet ) , at which the coverage of the deviation becomes less sufficient , the rapid increase of @xmath131 occurs at a substantially larger mass of @xmath128 . as a result ,",
    "the uncertainty in the determined lens mass for planets with @xmath132 is mostly dominated by @xmath131 rather than @xmath129 .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath131 estimated from the numerical analysis is larger than the expectation based on analytic analysis in   3.1 . to track down the difference",
    ", we did the same curvature matrix analysis to determine @xmath133 but not taking account the finite source effect ( and thus @xmath99 is excluded from the list of fitting parameters ) . from this , we find significant decrease of @xmath133 with the decrease of the number of fitting parameters .",
    "we find a similar trend when the blending effect is not taken into consideration .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the larger uncertainty @xmath133 obtained from the numerical analysis compared to the simple analytic analysis is due to the increase of the number of fitting parameters that are additionally included to account for the blending and the finite source effects ( i.e.  @xmath97 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "considering the high sampling rate with a large format ccd camera , the total data rate of the space microlensing survey will be large , and thus the data transmission from the satellite even at the l2 position will be still a major concern .",
    "one way to alleviate the problem is putting a satellite in a highly elliptical orbit with a period of @xmath3 month as proposed by @xcite .",
    "then , the satellite would spend majority of its time near @xmath134 au and it could focus on data transmission during the brief perigee each month .",
    "another concern for the proposed satellite observation is the location of the galactic bulge field in ecliptic coordinates , which are @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "then , while the physical distance to the l2 point is @xmath50 au , the projected separation is very small ( @xmath137 au ) around the time of summer solstice , when the terrestrial observation is optimal . therefore , during this time of the year , it would be impossible to measure the lens parallax by using the proposed method .",
    "however , the bulge season lasts more than @xmath138 months and the survey can be initiated before spring equinox and can be extended after autumnal equinox , at which the projected earth - satellite separation is maximized . therefore , lens parallaxes can be measured for a large fraction of the observation time .",
    "we note that the actual uncertainty of the mass measurements will be larger than our estimation because we did not include the uncertainty of the angular source size .",
    "there is no empirical calibration of stellar size for main - sequence stars because it is beyond the limit of current interferometric measurements and the available stellar size calibration for these stars are entirely based on theoretical stellar atmosphere calculations .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty of the distance to the source star will also contribute to the uncertainty of the mass determinations for free - floating planets .",
    "we propose an observational setup that enables one to determine the masses of free - floating planets via gravitational microlensing .",
    "the setup is similar to the one of @xcite proposed to resolve the mass degeneracy of the earth - mass planets and requires a modest adjustment to the orbit of an already proposed microlensing planet - finder satellite combined with ground - based observations .",
    "the proposed method is most sensitive to planets with masses ranging from @xmath0 to several jupiter masses .",
    "if realized , the proposed high - frequency lensing surveys will be able to play important roles in characterizing galactic free - floating planets that have not been probed before .",
