    "in neutrino - nucleon deep - inelastic scattering , events that present two muons in the final state are mainly due to the muonic decay of a charmed hadron produced in a neutrino charged - current interaction . the charm quark can be produced both through @xmath11 and @xmath12 weak currents .",
    "the @xmath13 transition dominates in the antineutrino induced dimuon events , whilst in neutrino induced interactions the @xmath11 and @xmath12 transition have comparable contributions , as the large valence @xmath14 quark content of the nucleon compensates for the cabibbo suppressed @xmath11 transition .",
    "dimuon events in neutrino interactions can be used to measure the strange quark content of the nucleon and the value of the charm quark mass . moreover , the charm production mechanism is of great importance for testing perturbative qcd predictions .",
    "neutrino charm production has been investigated with counter experiments like cdhs  @xcite , ccfr  @xcite , charm ii  @xcite , nomad  @xcite and nutev  @xcite , as well as bubble chambers ( bebc  @xcite ) and nuclear emulsion detectors like e531  @xcite and chorus  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the study of a sample of neutrino induced charged - current dimuon events produced in the lead - scintillating fibre calorimeter of the chorus detector ; the collected statistics is the second largest to date .",
    "the analysis is performed in the framework of the leading order qcd formalism and the result will be expressed in terms of the strange content of the nucleus @xmath15 , the charm quark mass @xmath16 , the peterson fragmentation parameter @xmath17and the charmed hadron semileptonic branching ratio @xmath18 .",
    "the chorus experiment has been designed for a short - baseline search of neutrino oscillations in the @xmath19-@xmath20 channel at relatively high @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the detector was exposed to the wide band neutrino beam at cern from 1995 until 1998 .",
    "neutrinos were produced at the sps by a proton beam of 450  gev ; the average @xmath19 energy was 27  gev with a @xmath22 contamination of about 6% .",
    "the detector is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it consists of a nuclear emulsion target , a fibre tracker , an air gap hadron spectrometer , a lead - scintillating fibre calorimeter and a muon spectrometer .",
    "the 112 ton lead - scintillating fibre calorimeter , described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , consists of three sections ( em , had1 , had2 ) with decreasing granularity along the beam direction , for a total of 5.2 interaction lengths . owing to its high mass , the calorimeter also provides an active target for incoming neutrinos . a large number of neutrino charged - current interactions on lead was collected during the four years of data taking .",
    "a test beam calibration of the calorimeter performances was carried out during the data taking and results are reported in ref .",
    "two neural net algorithms were developed in order to improve the vertex position resolution and the energy resolution for charged - current events originating in the calorimeter .",
    "both algorithms have been tuned for the purposes of this analysis on monte - carlo neutrino induced events which present more than one reconstructed muon in the final state . the vertex finding algorithm achieved a longitudinal and transverse position resolution of @xmath23 cm and @xmath24  cm , respectively , with an average efficiency of finding the correct calorimeter plane of ( 82 @xmath25 1)% .",
    "the energy resolution was estimated to be @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 expressed in gev ) .    a muon spectrometer composed of six magnetized iron toroids instrumented with drift chambers and scintillators",
    "is located further downstream to identify muons and determine their momentum . a resolution varying from @xmath28 at 20  @xmath29to @xmath30 at 70  @xmath29was achieved , as measured with test beam muons .",
    "the trigger system of the chorus experiment is described in ref .",
    "a dedicated muon trigger was set - up to collect a large statistic of `` double track '' events used both in dimuon and trimuon analyses  @xcite .",
    "a total of @xmath31 protons were accumulated on the be target in the period 19951998 and the overall chorus data collection efficiency was about 92% with a dead time of 5% .",
    "neutrino interactions with two muons in the final state mainly occur when the weak charged - current on a @xmath14 or @xmath32 quark produces a charmed quark and the charmed hadron subsequently decays with a probability @xmath18 into a muon and other hadrons .",
    "the primary muon and the decay muon have opposite electric charge .",
    "the large value of the charm quark mass gives rise to an energy threshold for the process ; this is described in the leading order qcd formalism by the so called `` slow rescaling '' mechanism  @xcite .      the leading order ( lo ) qcd framework of deep - inelastic neutrino scattering ( dis ) has been adopted to describe charm quark production .",
    "this scheme is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and uses the helicity formalism to describe the neutrino charged - current cross - section .",
    "it has the advantage of treating in a natural way the different mass scales involved in the heavy quark production process .",
    "the neutrino charm production cross - section is written as @xmath33 \\ \\label{cslo}\\ ] ] in terms of the bjorken variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the fermi constant @xmath36 . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the ckm matrix elements , @xmath39 and @xmath40 being the momentum distributions of the scattered quarks .",
    "the angle @xmath41 is related to @xmath27 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the incoming neutrino energy , the leading muon energy and the @xmath44 boson four - momentum , respectively : @xmath45 this reduces to @xmath46 when @xmath16 vanishes . with @xmath47 the mass of the scattered quark and @xmath48 the nucleon mass , the scaling variable @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and the function @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 in the limit @xmath54 the variable @xmath49 becomes the usual `` slow rescaling '' variable  @xcite .",
    "when dealing with experimentally measured quantities , the expression  ( [ cslo ] ) has to be corrected for the electromagnetic radiative processes arising in the final state whose effect is to lower the primary muon energy and , correspondingly , to raise the hadronic shower energy . a correction for such an effect has been applied according to the prescription of bardin  @xcite .      to interpret the experimental data in terms of charm quark production described by eq .",
    "( [ cslo ] ) a parametrization of the quark content in the target nuclei is required .",
    "the grv94lo parton distribution functions derived from experimental deep - inelastic scattering data has been used  @xcite . to take into account the non - isoscalarity of the lead - scintillating fibre calorimeter",
    ", the total valence quark content has been parametrized as @xmath55 where , due to strong isospin symmetry , the _ down _ quark content of the neutron is taken to be the same as the _ up _ quark content of the proton . the strange quark content in protons and neutrons",
    "is assumed to be the same .",
    "the non - strange sea - quark contents of the nucleon is assumed to be symmetric between up and down quarks .",
    "the strange quark content of the nucleon is described by the parameter @xmath56",
    "dx}{\\int   \\left [ x\\bar{u}(x,\\mu_o^2 ) + x\\bar{d}(x,\\mu_o^2 ) \\right ] dx } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath57 is an arbitrary reference scale chosen to be 20 gev@xmath58 . in the following , an su(3 )",
    "flavour symmetric sea is assumed ; this means that the strange and the anti - strange content of the nucleon are the same and have the same @xmath34 dependence",
    ".    an additional parameter @xmath59 is often introduced in similar analyses that allows the strange quark to behave differently from the up and down quarks .",
    "this is obtained by multiplying the strange quark parton distribution function ( _ pdf _ ) by the factor @xmath60 . in the following the weighted average @xmath61 of the values given by the charm ii and",
    "ccfr leading order analyses is used .",
    "the non - perturbative processes that act to `` dress '' the bare charm quark produced in the neutrino interaction are known as fragmentation or hadronization .",
    "the fragmentation is usually described as a function of the variable @xmath62 defined as the fraction of the longitudinal momentum taken over by the charm hadron @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the maximum hadron longitudinal momentum relative to the w - boson direction in the boson - nucleon center of mass reference frame .",
    "the peterson parametrization of the charm quark fragmentation is written as  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath17is a free parameter to be determined from the data . in leading order qcd",
    ", the neutrino cross - section can be factorized as @xmath67 this is no longer true in the next - to - leading order formalism  @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum of charmed hadrons with respect to the w - boson direction is on average small ( @xmath68 @xmath69 ) and is assumed to be distributed as @xmath70 .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 is taken to be @xmath72 following ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fragmentation variable @xmath62 can not be determined on an event - by - event basis since the direction of the charm quark or charmed hadron can not be measured directly .",
    "the visible fragmentation variable is thus defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the energy of the muon coming from the charmed hadron decay and the hadronic shower final state energy , respectively .",
    "the relation between @xmath62 and @xmath76 has been studied with the aid of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the dimuon sample was collected during four years of data taking using a dedicated trigger setup based on the energy released in the fibre calorimeter and on the presence of two or more well separated tracks in the spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "a total of @xmath77 events tagged as dimuons by the trigger were reduced to about @xmath78 requiring that at least two muons were well reconstructed in the muon spectrometer . for each event ,",
    "the reconstructed muon energy @xmath42 , the angle of the muon with respect to the neutrino beam direction @xmath79 evaluated at the interaction vertex and the hadron shower energy @xmath80 are used to derive the following kinematic variables :    * @xmath81 , the visible neutrino energy * @xmath82 , the visible four - momentum transfer squared * @xmath83 , the visible bjorken @xmath34 * @xmath84 , the visible fragmentation variable , as reported in eq .",
    "[ zvis ] .",
    "the final sample of dimuon events was selected imposing the following selection criteria :    * at least two muons must be well reconstructed , i.e. a minimum of five measured track points in the drift chambers placed in the gaps between the iron magnets is required for both muons ; * the longitudinal position of the event vertex ( @xmath85 ) determined by the neural net algorithm must be inside a fiducial volume given by @xmath86  cm ( this corresponds mainly to the had1 part of the calorimeter ) ; the transverse vertex positions ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) are required to satisfy @xmath89  cm to ensure hadronic shower lateral containment ; * the shower energy must be in the range @xmath90  @xmath91 ; * to ensure a good reconstruction quality and control of the acceptances , a cut @xmath92 gev when extrapolated to the vertex position in the calorimeter is applied .",
    "this cut also reduces the meson decay background ; * the reconstructed neutrino energy must be in the range @xmath93  gev to ensure a good control of the detection efficiencies ; * a cut @xmath94 @xmath69is applied in order to exclude regions in which the monte - carlo simulation is not reliable , as described in the following section ; * the transverse distance between the two muons extrapolated to the interaction vertex @xmath34 coordinate ( @xmath95 ) is requested to be less than @xmath96  cm to reject background due to hadron decays .",
    "the primary muon is assumed to be the one with the highest @xmath97with respect to the neutrino beam direction ; this leads to a ( 95.8 @xmath25 1.0)% efficiency to correctly identify the primary muon for neutrino induced interactions and ( 94.0 @xmath25 1.1)% for antineutrino interactions . in cases in which there are more than two reconstructed muons ,",
    "the two most energetic ones are used in the analysis .",
