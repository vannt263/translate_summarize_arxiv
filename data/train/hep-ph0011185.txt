    "if conventional many - body atomic and nuclear effects can be ruled out as the source of these deviations , the @xmath9-decay and apv results imply the existence of new physics at the 1 - 10 tev scale@xcite .",
    "this possibility has motivated a variety of additional atomic and nuclear new physics searches , including new measurements of the neutron @xmath9-decay parameters , apv observables along a chain of isotopes , and parity - violating ( pv ) electron - electron and electron - proton scattering .",
    "one possible manifestation of new physics not probed by the aforementioned experiments would be the existence of new low - energy interactions involving a single generation of fermions which violate time - reversal invariance ( t ) but conserve parity invariance ( p ) .",

    "attempts to do so were first reported in ref .",

    "this relationship has not been systematically delineated in the past .",
    "consequently , some confusion about the respective implications of edm s and the values of hadronic couplings extracted from direct tvpc searches has ensued .",
    "we believe that our analysis has helped clarify these implications .    while the possible origin of tvpc interactions in the context of a renormalizable gauge theory has yet to be delineated ,",
    "one may , nevertheless , address the issue using the framework of eft .",
    "this framework affords a systematic method for treating nonrenormalizable interactions and for carrying out the associated phenomenology .",
    "since the operators we have treated here have @xmath342 , eft is the natural framework for performing our analysis .",
    "as emphasized above , a key ingredient in the application of eft to this problem is the maintenance of a scale separation .",
    "the short - distance ( @xmath35 ) tvpc physics about which we are ignorant is parameterized by the _ a priori _ unknown coefficients of the nonrenormalizable effective interactions . long distance ( @xmath97 ) physics may be treated explicitly in the guise of loops and many - body matrix elem ents involving degrees of freedom having masses and momenta below @xmath29 . as we illustrated for the example of the cut - off regulator used in the loop calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , a failure to adhere to this scale separation can lead to disastrous results .",
    "indeed , in that example , the blurring of scale separation implies ( erroneously ) that the edm is proportional to an infinite series of unknown coefficients of nonrenormalizable operators of arbitrarily high dimension . without the truncation scheme implied by the eft scale separation ,",
    "one is unable to learn anything from experiment about a given tvpc interaction ( or even finite set of such interactions ) .    as argued at the outset of our paper",
    ", the eft scale separation implies one must consider the low - energy consequences of tvpc new physics under two scenarios : parity - restoration below @xmath29 ( scenario a ) and parity - restoration above @xmath29 ( scenario b ) . in the case of scenario",
    "a , the edm is dominated by pv radiative corrections to @xmath88 tvpc operators .",
    "the most significant impact arises from the edm of elementary fermions , generated by a one - loop graph involving @xmath87 .",
    "interpreted in terms of a mass scale , this mechanism , taken with the experimental limits on @xmath169 and @xmath26 , imply that @xmath343 100 - 250 tev when the tvpc new physics is strong \" ( @xmath344 ) .",
    "the impact of many - quark effects  which contribute both directly to @xmath26 as well as to both @xmath26 and @xmath66 via the couplings @xmath49 and @xmath55  is considerably smaller than that of the one - loop elementary fermion edm .",
    "indeed , for the many - quark mechanism to compete with that of the elementary fermion edm , one would require an improvement in the limits on @xmath66 of nine orders of magnitude .",
    "the impact of direct search limits is even weaker under this scenario .",
    "we conclude , then , that @xmath169 and @xmath26 provide the most powerful probes of new tvpc physics when parity symmetry is restored at short distances , while the atomic edm measurements are better suited to constraining other new physics scenarios .    under scenario b , the implications of edm s are ambiguous at best .",
    "the existence of parity - violation at short distances implies that @xmath345 tvpv operators contribute to the edm along with the radiatively corrected @xmath91 tvpc operators .",
    "consequently , no single tvpv observable constrains the latter unless one invokes additional assumptions .",
    "in contrast , the relationship between tvpc observables  such as csb @xmath19 scattering cross sections or fc in neutron transmission  is not clouded by the additional unknown constants which enter the edm . in this case , however , the limits obtained from direct tvpc searches are rather weak : @xmath343 1 gev ( for @xmath344 ) . as a long term benchmark , one would ideally search for new tvpc physics at least up to the weak scale . achieving this goal",
