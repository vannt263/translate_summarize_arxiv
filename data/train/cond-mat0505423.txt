    "a general feature of strongly interacting electron systems is a sizeable suppression of the metallic character , accompanied by a redistribution of the spectral weight from the region close to the fermi level towards higher energies . in the presence of a strong electron - electron repulsion , for example",
    ", incoherent excitations arise far from the fermi energy in the so - called upper and lower hubbard bands , at an energy scale which is ruled by the strength @xmath0 of the interaction . a similar behavior is also found in systems with strong electron - lattice coupling , where the spectral weight is transferred to a broad peak located around the polaron binding energy @xmath1 .",
    "recent photoemission experiments in the high - tc cuprates @xcite , which are generally described in terms of purely electronic models due to the proximity to a mott insulating phase , have revealed the existence of an important electron - lattice coupling .",
    "this has given rise to intense theoretical work focusing on the excitation spectra in the presence of electron - boson interactions , both in models with @xcite and without @xcite electronic correlations .",
    "of particular interest are those works which focus on isotope effects ( ie ) , since they can disentangle the properties which are directly related to the coupling to the lattice degrees of freedom . for example",
    ", it has been found that an anomalous isotope effect on the effective mass arises at the polaron crossover , signaling the breakdown of the migdal - eliashberg adiabatic approximation @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of the ie is also expected in the proximity of a mott metal - insulator transition , i.e. at intermediate values of the electron - electron repulsion @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a strong electronic repulsion suppresses the effects of the lattice dynamics on the low energy excitations near the fermi level .",
    "these persist at high energy , where they amount essentially to a broadening of the electronic spectra @xcite .",
    "in this work , we provide an approximate theoretical framework based on the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , which qualitatively describes the high - energy excitation spectra resulting from both electron - electron and electron - boson interactions , treating the fluctuations of magnetic and bosonic origin as a local _ static _ disorder . although simplified , the present analytical treatment is able to account for the existence of broad incoherent peaks at high energy , which are a common characteristic of strongly interacting electronic systems .",
    "we analyze two extreme cases which can be important for our general understanding of the problem : ( i ) a mott - hubbard insulator at half - filling , in the presence of an additional local interaction of the electrons with dispersionless bosons and ( ii ) a polaronic semiconductor , where the physics is solely determined by the electron - boson coupling . in the former case ,",
    "the validity of our approach relies on the separation of electronic and bosonic energy scales , which is achieved due to a strong electron - electron repulsion . in the latter case ,",
    "the present cpa results are controlled by direct comparison with an exact solution obtained by dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "the consequences of the electron - boson coupling on the dispersion and width of the high energy features in the spectral function are calculated in both situations , in section ii and iii respectively .",
    "particular attention is devoted to the effect of a shift of the boson frequency , as can be achieved through an isotopic substitution if the bosonic mode that couples to the electrons is a lattice vibration , or more generally if it is a collective mode with a sizeable lattice component ( in which case a non - trivial ie can still arise , provided that the frequency of the boson is modified by the isotopic substitution ) . in the present approximation , the ie on the high energy part of the spectrum turns out to be qualitatively similar in the mott - hubbard insulator and in the polaronic semiconductor , being mainly determined by the strength of the electron - boson coupling ( albeit slightly enhanced by the presence of electronic correlations ) : in both cases it is strongly temperature and energy dependent , in agreement with the recently measured ie in the high temperature superconductor bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a tentative analysis of the experimental results , performed in section iv , is compatible with the existence of a moderate electron - phonon coupling in the cuprates .",
    "we study the following holstein - hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath4 where electrons in a band with dispersion @xmath5 mutually interact through an on - site repulsion @xmath0 , and are coupled locally to a dispersionless bosonic mode of frequency @xmath6 , with a strength @xmath7 .",
    "we shall set the energy units such that @xmath8 .",
    "we calculate the spectral properties of the above model at half filling , in the framework of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite .",
    "this is suitable for the mott insulating phase at large @xmath0 , but also gives a fair description of the high energy incoherent excitations in the correlated metal , provided that the upper and the lower hubbard bands are well separated from the low energy quasi - particle peak @xcite .",
    "the latter , however , is not accessible within this theory , and the position of the chemical potential remains undetermined except at half - filling .",
    "additional features that are not included in the present description are the coherent excited states that arise at low temperature , ( even in the insulating phase ) , due to the quantum nature of the magnetic excitations , in an energy range @xmath9 around the hubbard band edges @xcite , and whose dispersion is srongly reminiscent of spin density waves .    bearing these limitations in mind",
    ", the success of the cpa is that , despite its formal simplicity , it correctly accounts for the high - energy scattering by the randomly distributed magnetic moments .",
    "the momentum - integrated green s function has the form @xcite : @xmath10\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is an effective propagator which takes hopping processes into account .",
    "it can be eliminated by introducing a local self - energy @xmath12 through the following self - consistency condition : @xmath13 ( in the `` atomic '' limit , @xmath14 and the usual single site propagator is recovered @xcite ) . for each frequency @xmath15 , we are left with a system of two equations for the two complex unknowns @xmath16 and @xmath12 .    in the presence of a local electron - boson interaction , equation ( [ eq : cpalambda=0 ] ) can be generalized by introducing an additional field @xmath17 , which accounts for the random distribution of electronic energies due to the fluctuations of the bosons at different sites @xmath18.\\ ] ]    in a system where the on - site electron - electron repulsion directly competes with the attraction induced by the bosons , the formation of bipolarons ( and the resulting strong anharmonicities in the boson field ) @xcite is prevented provided that @xmath0 is much larger than the polaron binding energy @xmath19 @xcite . in this case , we can assume that the boson field obeys the following gaussian distribution , @xmath20\\ ] ] the variance @xmath21 is determined either by the thermal fluctuations ( at high temperature , @xmath22 ) or by the quantum fluctuations of the bosons ( at low temperature , @xmath23 ) .",
    "let us emphasize that we have neglected boson renormalization effects which , even in the presence of a strong electron - boson interaction , are suppressed by a sufficiently strong repulsion @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such effects can in principle be included by taking @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : variance ] ) equal to the measured boson frequency rather than the bare parameter of eq .",
    "( [ eq : themodel ] ) .",
    "however , the present scheme is expected to break down in situations where the bosonic and electronic energy scales become comparable ( i.e. @xmath24 ) , in which case the properties of the bosonic field depend crucially on the electron correlations .    equations ( [ eq : selfcons ] ) and ( [ eq : cpa ] ) form the backbone of our theory .",
    "the latter can be further explicited by evaluating the hilbert - transform of the gaussian @xmath25\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the complex error function @xcite .",
    "note also that , since the self - energy @xmath27 does not depend on momentum , the details of the band dispersion @xmath28 enter in equation ( [ eq : selfcons ] ) only through the corresponding density of states .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we shall consider a band dispersion @xmath28 with a semicircular density of states of half - width @xmath29 , for which the self - consistency equation ( [ eq : selfcons ] ) reduces to @xmath30 .",
    "however , since they rely on a momentum independent quantity ( the local self - energy ) , the results are quite independent on the choice of the band dispersion .",

    "such bands represent incoherent states that are strongly scattered by the disordered magnetic moments .",
    "the corresponding spectral function @xmath41 exhibits broad peaks , whose width is comparable with the bandwidth itself : it is determined by the scattering rate @xmath42 , which is proportional to the spectral density , and is therefore strongly energy dependent . as a consequence ,",
    "the peaks sharpen ( and become asymmetric ) when approaching the band edges , as can be seen in the energy scans at constant momentum , in figure 2.a ( dashed green curve ) .",
    "their dispersion , defined as the locus of the maxima of @xmath41 at constant @xmath15 ( the so - called momentum distribution curves , mdc ) can be obtained by solving the equation @xmath43 , and is roughly given by @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "it should be noted that the slope of the dispersion of such high energy features deviates significantly from the unrenormalized fermi velocity @xmath45 .",
    "for this reason , in strongly correlated electron systems , some care should be taken when extracting the function @xmath46 from experimental data under the assumption that @xmath45 tends asymptotically to its unrenormalized value at sufficiently high energy , as is customary in the field @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the coupling to a bosonic mode leads to several modifications of the picture described above .",
    "first of all , the fluctuations of the site energies lead , through the relation ( [ eq : cpa ] ) , to an overall broadening of the hubbard bands . in particular , this generates additional exponential tails in the vicinity of the band edges , whose extension is governed by the variance @xmath47 . in the adiabatic regime , where the boson frequency is small compared to the bandwidth ( @xmath48 ) , and for large @xmath0 , such tails are typically smaller than both the width of the hubbard bands and the size of the gap ( see figure 1.a )    the spectral function @xmath41 , for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , is illustrated in figure 2.a at different values of @xmath28",
    ". this value of the variance corresponds , for example , to a moderate electron - boson coupling @xmath51 , in the adiabatic regime @xmath52 and at zero temperature .",
    "the purely electronic case ( @xmath53 ) is also shown for comparison ( dashed green lines ) .",
    "the electron - boson coupling strongly alters the lineshapes : well inside the hubbard bands , there is a huge broadening of the peaks , which can be estimated in the large @xmath0 limit ( see appendix ) to @xmath54 , and is of the order of @xmath55% in the present example .",
    "however , the effect is even more dramatic in in the vicinity of the band edges .",
    "there , the scattering rate , which is roughly proportional to the spectral density , has a sharp ( square root ) dependence on the energy in the pure electronic case , causing a marked asymmetry of the peaks .",
    "the boson fluctuations convert the sharp edge in a much smoother exponential tail , restoring a more symmetric lineshape for @xmath41 .",
    "let us mention that the above - mentioned power law behavior at the edges of the hubbard bands is not peculiar to the semi - circular dos used in this example ( see ref .",

    "we shall now analyze the consequences of a change in the boson frequency on the spectral properties .",

    ", we immediately see that any isotopic effect will be strongly temperature dependent , on the scale of the boson frequency itself : at low temperatures , where @xmath70 , a modification of @xmath6 directly affects the distribution ( [ gaussian ] ) of the lattice displacements , and therefore modifies the spectral properties described above .",
    "however , this effect is rapidly suppressed when the thermal fluctuations become dominant , in which case @xmath71 is independent on the boson frequency . in the following",
    ", we shall present the results at @xmath72 , where the ie is maximum .",

    "the inset of figure 2.a shows the ie on the peaks in @xmath41 at various @xmath28 close to the edge of the lhb .",
    "the reduction of the boson frequency leads to a weak shift of the peak position , corresponding to a slight reduction of the slope @xmath77 , which is too weak to be observed at such moderate values of @xmath1 ( see also the inset of figure 2.b , where we have reported the renormalized dispersion close to the upper edge of the band ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we know from the previous section that the effect of the electron - boson coupling is much stronger on the linewidths than on the dispersion , and indeed some reduction of the peak widths is already visible in the plots of @xmath41 . for a more quantitative analysis , we have reported in figure 2.c the ie on the scattering rate , defined as @xmath78-\\gamma[\\omega_0]$ ] .",
    "it shows an interesting dependence on the energy : it is rather flat inside the hubbard bands , but exhibits pronounced peaks of width @xmath79 around the band edges , because this is the region where the spectra are mostly affected by the bosonic fluctuations .",
    "the variation of the linewidth in the flat region well inside the hubbard bands is approximately given by ( see appendix ) @xmath80 and gives a direct measure of the strength of the electron - boson coupling . note that although the precise numerical coefficient is specific to the semi - circular dos considered here , analogous formulas can in principle be derived for any choice of the noninteracting band ( in fact , a similar result also holds in the weak coupling regime @xcite ) .    above the band edges , the ie decays exponentially , following the fluctuation induced tails in the spectral density",
    "this gives rise to an extremely asymmetric peak of @xmath81 at the band edge , which becomes more and more symmetric as @xmath82 is increased ( cf .",
    "the discussion on the spectral function in the previous section ) . for sufficiently large @xmath83 , @xmath84 tends to a skewed gaussian , whose maximum is located in @xmath85 , whose width is proportional to @xmath82 and height scales as @xmath86",
    "in this section , we use the approximate theory presented above to address the spectral properties in a system with electron - boson interactions , but in the absence of electron - electron correlations . for this problem ,",
    "extensive results are available in the litterature for the weak coupling regime @xcite , and for the polaronic anti - adiabatic regime , where the boson frequency is assumed to be much larger than the noninteracting bandwidth @xcite .",
    "we shall focus instead on the polaronic adiabatic regime ( i.e. moderate to strong electron - boson couplings @xmath87 and adiabatic bosons @xmath48 ) , which is more often encountered in solids @xcite , and for which a simple formulation of the spectral properties is not clearly established .    for the problem of a single electron coupled to a dispersionless boson ,",
    "a complete characterization of the excitation spectrum has been given in references @xcite , based on the dynamical mean field theory . in the adiabatic regime , the spectra are composed of one ( or several , depending on the coupling strength ) narrow features at low energy , equally spaced by @xmath6 , coexisting with a continuous high energy background centered around the polaron binding energy @xmath1 .",
    "as the coupling strength increases , the low - energy features are rapidly suppressed and the spectral weight becomes dominated by the high - energy incoherent background .",
    "it should be stressed that , contrary to what happens in the anti - adiabatic limit , the high - energy features here are _ dispersive _ due to the strong hybridization with the free - electron states ( see e.g. fig .",
    "14 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the high - energy incoherent excitations are well described by an equation analogous to ( [ eq : cpa ] ) , @xmath88 where the boson field obeys the same gaussian distribution of eq . ( [ gaussian ] ) .",

    "the evolution of such peak - hump structure , which is characteristic of the intermediate coupling regime ( in the strong coupling regime , the narrow features are too weak to be observed ) causes a discontinuous jump , or kink , in the dispersion , which clearly separates the high and low - energy regions with different slopes , as illustrated in figure 3.b ( see also figure 3 in reference @xcite ) . the isotope effect on the kink region is shown in the inset .",
    "note that in this plot , the isotope shift vanishes at @xmath108 by definition , since the origin of energies has been shifted to coincide with the band edge ( see the discussion at the beginning of this section ) .      at extremely large values of the coupling strength @xmath112 ( or at sufficiently high temperatures @xmath113 ) , the variance of the boson field can become comparable with the noninteracting bandwidth ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the latter can therefore be neglected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpa ] ) , replacing @xmath114 .",
    "note that this does not correspond to the usual atomic , anti - adiabatic limit @xcite , where it is assumed from the beginning that @xmath115 is the smallest energy scale in the problem , resulting in _ dispersionless _ high energy features .",
    "the present theory is valid in the opposite limit , @xmath116 , which is more often realized in solids @xcite . due to the large transfer integrals between molecular units , the discrete shakeoff spectrum characteristic of isolated molecules",
    "is converted here into a continuous gaussian spectral density @xcite , and a sizeable high - energy dispersion is recovered .",
    "we recognize from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpa - sp ] ) that the spectral density in this case coincides with the gaussian distribution itself , @xmath117 whose width is governed by the variance @xmath82 ( we have performed the shift @xmath118 using the fact that @xmath119 in the strong coupling limit ) . the full green s function @xmath120 can be read directly from eq .",

    "( [ eq : spect - strong ] ) , which is governed by the variance @xmath82 ] .",
    "correspondingly , the slope of the high - energy dispersion saturates to a finite value in the strong electron - boson coupling limit , which is independent of the coupling strength , and is larger than the noninteracting value ( cf .",
    "the situation in the mott - hubbard insulator at strong @xmath0 , section ii.b ) .    in the energy interval spanned by the dispersion @xmath63 ,",
    "the scattering rate is roughly constant and directly proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "its variation under a change of the boson frequency is given by @xmath128 which is similar to the behavior encountered near the edges of the hubbard bands [ cf .",
    "in this work , we have presented an approximate analytical theory which addresses the high energy spectral properties in systems characterized by a strong electron - boson coupling , both in the presence and in the absence of electronic correlations . concerning the electron - boson interaction alone ,",
    "the present approach gives accurate results in the adiabatic regime ( i.e. opposite to the standard strong - coupling polaron theories ) , where its validity can be controlled by direct comparison with the results of the dynamical mean field theory .",
    "for the correlation part , on the other hand , it reduces to the cpa treatment of reference @xcite , which qualitatively accounts for the incoherent high - energy excitations located in the upper and lower hubbard bands .    although the microscopic mechanisms in the cuprates certainly go beyond the simple model and approximations presented here , our results reproduce at least qualitatively several characteristics of the observed photoemission spectra , such as the existence of broad peaks with a sizeable momentum dispersion , which sharpen and become more asymmetric ( in the edc scans ) as the band edge is approached .",
    "more specifically , we have calculated the isotope effect on the high - energy spectral features . in the present framework , where the bosonic and magnetic fluctuations are effectively decoupled",
    ", the overall behavior in the mott insulator and in the polaronic semiconductor is qualitatively similar .",
    "the most notable result is the existence of a strongly energy dependent ie on the _ linewidths _ , which is maximum in a narrow energy interval of width @xmath47 near the band edges , because this is the region where the excitation spectrum is mostly affected by the electron - boson interaction ( new spectral weight is created there , due to the presence of boson fluctuations ) .",
    "the present approach also predicts a strong temperature dependence of the ie , which should be strongly suppressed when the temperature reaches some fraction of the boson frequency ( typically @xmath75 ) .",
    "this occurs because at high temperatures , the fluctuations of the boson field are dominated by thermal effects , which are independent on the boson frequency , and is in no way related to the existence of a temperature dependent electron - boson coupling .",
    "note that , according to the above general arguments , an analogous energy and temperature dependence of the ie can also be expected in more accurate treatments of the electron correlations .",
    "the results of section ii can be tentatively compared with the experimental results of references @xcite .",
    "if we associate the variance @xmath82 with the observed width @xmath129 of the active ie region , and take the value @xmath130 for the boson energy , a `` polaron '' binding energy @xmath131 is obtained . assuming a noninteracting bandwidth of the order of @xmath132 places this value in the intermediate electron - boson coupling regime .",
    "the same value of @xmath82 is also compatible with the magnitude of the observed ie on the scattering rate . from the frequency",
    "softening @xmath133 deduced from the shift of the kink energy , the theory predicts a decrease of the scattering rate around the band edges of the order @xmath134 ( see the end of section ii.d ) , in agreement with the experimental observations of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the present theory , based on a momentum independent electronic self - energy , clearly fails in addressing the strongly anisotropic _ dispersion _ observed in the cuprate superconductors , which demands to go beyond a local ( and classical ) treatment of the bosonic and magnetic fluctuations . in particular , the edges of the hubbard bands at low temperature are strongly affected by the `` spin density wave '' dispersion , especially at intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "another point which is beyond the range of validity of the present approach is the enhancement of the low energy ie due to proximity to a mott metal - insulator transition . in this case",
    ", even a weak electron - boson interaction may produce a huge effect when the boson frequency is varied @xcite .",
