    "lmcx-1 resides in the highly complex nebula region n159 @xcite .",
    "it is the most powerful known x - ray source in the lmc @xcite , with an x - ray luminosity @xmath1 @xcite , and is believed to be powered by accretion onto a stellar mass ( @xmath2 ) black hole with a companion o7iii - type star identified as star 32 @xcite . @xcite collated extensive spectral data and ruled out collisional excitation by a supernova remnant .",
    "they concluded that their detection of heii  emission is the first evidence for an x - ray ionized nebula ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that the slit spectra used in these studies were limited to a relatively localized region of the nebula , in the immediate vicinity of lmcx-1 .    using integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) ,",
    "we present new evidence suggesting that x - ray photoionization can not be solely responsible for the observed large scale morphology and high excitation lines , which we propose are best understood in terms of shock ionization attributable to an as yet undetected relativistic jet from lmcx-1 .",
    "indeed , the highly complex ionization structure of the extended nebula surrounding lmcx-1 is strikingly reminiscent of the other two only known examples of jet - induced shock ionized nebulae , those surrounding the powerful galactic x - ray binaries ss433 @xcite and cygnus x-1 @xcite .",
    "we were initially alerted to the possibility of shock ionization in n159f after observing with the taurus tunable filter ( ttf ) at the anglo - australian telescope @xcite in 2003 december .",
    "we discovered a rich system of streaming h@xmath3 filaments in the arcmin - scale nebula .",
    "the filaments trail back from the apex of a conical cavity in the dust emission seen in the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) image of @xcite .",
    "the apex is positioned @xmath4 south - west of lmcx-1 , corresponding to @xmath5 at a distance @xmath6 to the lmc @xcite .",
    "motivated by these observations , we undertook further investigation into the environment of lmcx-1 through integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) with vimos at the very large telescope ( vlt ) in 2005 november .",
    "the new data reveal strong detections of optical emission lines due to [ oi ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] , hei  and [ ariii ] , as well as h@xmath3 .",
    "the emission lines all show a similar morphological bow shock structure as the initial h@xmath3  filamentary streamers seen in the ttf image . in figure 3 of @xcite , which overlays the 5ghz radio contours of @xcite on an ir image of n159",
    ", radio emission appears to trace the irac cavity .",
    "we summarize the observations and data reduction procedures in  2 . in  3 , we present our results and provide an interpretation of the environment of lmcx-1 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  4 .",
    "our initial ttf observations of the n159f nebula were taken in a @xmath7  bandpass centred on h@xmath3 .",
    "a powerful differential technique called ` straddle shuffling ' @xcite was used to remove the surrounding continuum emission to better than 1% accuracy , revealing the filamentary structure of the nebula .",
    "these data prompted observations with the vimos integral field unit ( ifu ) at the vlt on 2005 november 2 , 5 , 6 .",
    "conditions were reported as photometric , with @xmath8 seeing ( well matched to the @xmath9 spatial scale of the ifu ) .",
    "observations were queue scheduled using the hr - orange grating ( r@xmath102500 , @xmath115250 - 7400 ) and include the emission lines h@xmath3 , [ oi ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] , hei , and [ ariii ] .",
    "the systemic radial velocity ( @xmath12 ) of the lmc ensures that the [ oi ]  and h@xmath3  emission lines are well separated from their telluric counterparts .",
    "given the @xmath13 field - of - view of the vimos ifu in high resolution mode , four vimos pointings were required ( with a 5pixel/@xmath14 overlap ) to tile the h@xmath3  filaments along the boundaries of the mid - ir cavity in the vicinity of lmcx-1 .",
    "three 1160sec exposures were taken at each of the four pointings .",
    "the data were reduced using the reduction pipeline vipgi ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "datacubes were created and sub - sections of the final mosaic were combined using a set of ifu data manipulation routines created in idl .",
    "emission line fitting was performed for each prominent spectral line using a single unresolved gaussian profile .    due to the restricted spectral coverage of the chosen vimos setting , the key shock diagnostic line [ oiii]@xmath155007 is not present in our data .",
    "however , we retrieved archival [ oiii ]  observations from the public eso archive .",
    "the 2.3 m wfi observations of n159f consists of 2@xmath16500sec observations using the [ oiii ]  filter and 2@xmath16125sec observations using the _ r@xmath17 _  filter .",
    "the data were processed in the usual manner ( overscan corrected , flatfielded from twilight flat frames , aligned and combined ) using elements of the casu imaging processing toolkit @xcite .",
    "continuum subtraction was achieved for the [ oiii ]  and h@xmath3  narrow band images using the aligned and scaled _ v _  and _ r@xmath17 _  images respectively . the wfi and vimos data were spatially registered and resampled using stellar images common to both data sets .",
    "figure  1 shows the main results from the new vimos , wfi and irac observations .",
    "together , these provide compelling evidence for shock ionization in the n159f nebula surrounding lmcx-1 .",
    "1(a - d ) show , respectively , the prominent emission lines h@xmath3 , [ ariii ]  and [ oi ]  in the vimos data cube , and [ oiii ]  from the continuum subtracted wfi data .",
    "a bow shock morphology , with trailing filaments , is evident in the images .",
    "1(e ) shows a line diagnostics plot formed from a pixel - pixel comparison of [ oiii]/[oi ]  vs. [ ariii]/[sii ]  where four color - coded ionization regions show spatial coherence over the n159f nebula ( see fig .",
    "1(f ) ) . fig .",
    "1(h ) is a 3-color _ spitzer _ irac image centered on star 32 @xcite , showing a dust cavity associated with the proposed bow shock .",
    "1(k ) presents a 3-color composite image in [ nii ]  ( red ) , h@xmath3  ( green ) and [ oi ]  ( blue ) .",
    "we speculate that the shock is driven by a jet , with orientation indicated in fig .",
    "1(k ) .",
    "separating out the shock - ionized part of the optical nebula is not straightforward , as radiative shocks can produce collisionally excited optical emission lines similar to those produced by x - ray photoionization ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "both ionization mechanisms can produce enhanced ( relative to hii  regions ) h@xmath3  as well as enhanced forbidden lines of neutral or low ionization species , such as [ oi]@xmath156300 , [ sii]@xmath116716,6731 and [ nii]@xmath116548,6583 , and of higher ionization species , such as [ oiii]@xmath115007,4959 and [ ariii]@xmath157136 .",
    "heii@xmath154686 is a reliable x - ray photoionization diagnostic as it is difficult to produce with shock ionization , while [ ariii ]  is difficult to produce with x - ray photoionization , except for very high ionization parameters ( r. sutherland , private communication ) .",
    "furthermore , x - ray photoionization tends to favour the production of [ oiii ]  over [ oi ]  @xcite . on the other hand , [ oiii ]",
    "can be a powerful shock diagnostic , since all radiative shock models @xcite consistently predict a dramatic onset of [ oiii ]  emission near a critical shock speed , @xmath18100kms@xmath19 .",
    "whilst the h@xmath3  and [ ariii ]  images in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) exhibit a similar morphological structure suggestive of a bow shock , a comparison of the [ oi ]  and [ oiii ]  images in fig .",
    "1(c ) and ( d ) shows regions of anticorrelation in the immediate vicinity of lmcx-1 and around the b5i star r148 @xcite , where there is a deficit of [ oi ]  emission , but enhanced [ oiii ]  emission .",
    "r148 is not capable of producing this high excitation emission . indeed ,",
    "its strmgren sphere ( @xmath20 ) does not even encompass one pixel of our image . the strmgren radius for star 32 ( the o7iii companion to lmcx-1 ",
    "@xcite ) is @xmath21 , comparable to the size of the blue region defined in fig .",
    "1(e ) and ( f ) .",
    "recalling that x - ray photoionization favours [ oiii ]  over [ oi ]  and can produce [ ariii ]  for high ionization parameters , this blue region , which exhibits the largest local enhancement in [ oiii]/[oi ]  and [ ariii]/[sii ] , must be due to the combined effects of x - ray ionization by lmcx-1 and photoionization by star 32 .",
    "the yellow region in fig .",
    "1(e ) and ( f ) is consistent with the extent of the x - ray strmgren radius ( @xmath22 ) , calculated by @xcite .",
    "note , however , that this yellow region is located to the east ( left ) of r148 , on the far side of lmcx-1 and spatially coincides with some of the streamers .",
    "thus , we interpret the yellow zone of enhanced [ ariii]/[sii ]  and [ oiii]/[oi ]  as being due to a combination of shock ionization and x - ray ionization .",
    "the red zone in fig .",
    "1(e ) and ( f ) is predominantly shock - ionized .",
    "1(i ) and ( j ) show a proposed trail of streamers through this shock - ionized region .",
    "the evidence for x - ray photoionization in n159f has hitherto been based on slit spectra of heii@xmath154686 emission detected in the immediate vicinity of lmcx-1 @xcite . in fig .",
    "1(l ) , we show the positioning of the echelle slits used by @xcite to detect the heii  emission .",
    "@xcite used similarly placed orthogonal slits , but centred on star 32 instead of r148 .",
    "note that although the echelle slits coincide with the yellow zone we identify as being both shock ionized and x - ray ionized , the observed heii@xmath154686 emission is almost certainly due to only x - ray ionization as none of the radiative shock models predict significant heii@xmath154686 .",
    "note also that it would have been extremely difficult to find unequivocal evidence for shock ionization from other line diagnostics due to the confusion with x - ray ionization in this region and also to the spatially limited extent of the slits . on scales of several parsecs ,",
    "our ifu data reveal enhanced [ oi]/h@xmath3 , [ oiii ] , and [ ariii ] , as well as h@xmath3 , forming a shell - like structure around lmcx-1 , but extending beyond the x - ray strmgren radius ( that is , beyond the yellow zone in fig .  1(e ) and",
    "this is compelling evidence that shock - ionization rather than x - ray ionization is primarily responsible for this high - excitation emission seen on the largest scales in the nebula .",
    "1(g ) shows an image of the electron number density , @xmath23 , deduced from the [ sii ]  emission @xcite .",
    "it reveals an enhanced flattened region that falls slightly inside and near the apex of the bow - shock morphology .",
    "this structure is highly suggestive of a ` mach disk ' commonly seen in bow shocks associated with herbig - haro jets @xcite . in the flattened region ,",
    "we find @xmath24 , a factor @xmath25 times greater than the environment .",
    "this is less than the maximum compression ratio of @xmath26 expected for a strong shock , but is compatible with the mach number inferred from the shock speed ( see below ) . from the high density region",
    ", we can determine a shock speed using the multitude of line ratios extracted from a single ifs exposure .",
    "1(m ) shows theoretical line ratios from the radiative shock model of @xcite .",
    "the dashed horizontal lines indicate the maximum and minimum shock speeds obtained from the new data for each corresponding line ratio . from the presence of [ oiii ]",
    ", we infer a lower limit @xmath27 @xmath28 80 kms@xmath19 .",
    "[ ariii]/hei  suggests @xmath27 @xmath29 190kms@xmath19 , while both the [ sii]/h@xmath3   and [ ariii]/h@xmath3   line ratios further constrain the shock velocity to @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we estimate a shock speed @xmath3190kms@xmath19 , as indicated by the black dashed vertical line in fig .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the line profiles being marginally resolved at @xmath32 km s@xmath19 fwhm within the high density region .",
    "it also implies a mach number of @xmath33 , assuming an isothermal sound speed @xmath34 for an ambient gas temperature of @xmath35 .",
    "we note , however , that the deduced value of @xmath27 is likely to be somewhat overestimated , as the @xcite shock model assumes a neutral pre - shock medium , and this produces a spectrum similar to preionized , shocked material with a lower @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the streamers are unlike the uniform wind - blown bow shocks associated with ob - runaway stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , the the inferred space velocity @xmath36 of the o7iii companion is too low to be consistent with this interpretation .",
    "we estimate @xmath370.4@xmath38 @xcite , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the wind velocity and mass loss rates of star 32 @xcite , @xmath41 is the mass density of the ambient medium , deduced from the [ sii ]  lines (  3.2 ) , using an ionization fraction of @xmath42 , and where @xmath43 is the distance between star 32 and the stagnation point ( apex ) , which has an angular distance @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath45 , where the inequality takes into account projection effects .",
    "we henceforth consider the possibility that the shock is produced by a jet from lmcx-1 .",
    "adopting the `` dentist drill '' model of @xcite , a cavity , or cocoon , develops naturally around a jet ploughing through the ambient ism .",
    "a shock develops around the cocoon and the shocked gas then comes into dynamical ( ram ) pressure equilibrium with the jet .",
    "thus , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the mass densities of the jet and shocked gas , respectively , and @xmath49 and @xmath27 are the corresponding speeds .",
    "the total jet kinetic power is @xmath50 ( assuming it is not too relativistic ) , where @xmath51 is the jet half opening angle and @xmath52 is the jet length ( distance to the impact site , at the apex of the cocoon , from lmcx-1 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath53 here , @xmath54 ( @xcite find an upper limit of @xmath55 for x - ray binary jets ) , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the jet inclination angle to our line - of - sight .",
    "we have used a post - shock electron number density @xmath58 (  3.2 ) to estimate @xmath48 .",
    "this estimate of jet power falls squarely within the range @xmath59 estimated by @xcite for quasi - steady x - ray binary jets .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that lmcx-1 currently appears to be in a persistent high / soft x - ray spectral state @xcite , during which it is unlikely to be producing a powerful jet @xcite and its x - ray luminosity is dominated by the accretion disk , which radiates away all the accretion power .",
    "since the accretion power inferred from the observed x - ray luminosity , @xmath60 , is an order of magnitude less than the inferred jet power , we suggest that rather than being a dark jet ( as @xcite proposed for cygx-1 , which is in a low / hard spectral state ) , the non - detection of the lmcx-1 jet results from the inherent transient nature of x - ray binary jets . the jet is not presently seen because it may have recently switched off and the shock - ionized nebula surrounding lmcx-1 is still radiating the energy impacted during an earlier jet - active epoch .",
    "we estimate a radiative cooling timescale of just @xmath61yrs , assuming @xmath62 solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "the jet - active phase may have been triggered by a relatively sudden increase in the mass accretion rate , which has a present value @xmath63 ( assuming a radiative efficiency of @xmath64 for standard thin disk accretion ) .",
    "the dynamical timescale over which the jet - driven shock has been expanding into the ism is estimated as @xmath65myr , which is remarkably similar to jet lifetime estimates obtained for other x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated the extraordinary power of integral field spectroscopy in our study of the emission - line nebula n159f around lmcx-1 .",
    "different emission - line diagnostics have been combined to separate out different ionization regions on extended scales .",
    "we propose that three ionizing sources contribute to the complex nature of n159f : 1 .",
    "photoionization by star 32 ( the o7iii companion to lmcx-1 ) ; 2 .",
    "x - ray photoionization by lmcx-1 itself ; and 3 . jet - driven shock ionization .",
    "the first two phenomena are relatively localized , whereas shock ionization dominates over the extended streamers , which appear to be bounded by a bow - shock morphology the morphology and ionization properties of the extended nebula around lmcx-1 are strikingly similar to those seen in other known jet - driven shock ionized nebulae around galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "we infer a shock speed of @xmath66 km s@xmath19 and deduce the power of the jet driving the shock to be @xmath67 erg s@xmath19 . since lmcx-1 is unlikely to be producing a jet in its current x - ray spectral state , we propose that the jet is intermittent , with a characteristic lifetime of @xmath68myr .",
