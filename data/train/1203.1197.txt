    "the notion of multipartite super dense coding was introduced by bose _",
    "@xcite to generalize the bennett - wiesner scheme @xcite of super dense coding to multiparties . in this scheme",
    "it was shown that the use of a multipartite entangled state can allow a single receiver to read messages from more than one source through a single measurement .",
    "a generalization of this multipartite super dense coding to higher dimensions was given by liu _",
    "distributed super dense coding was also widely discussed in @xcite in which two scenarios of many senders with either one or two receiver(s ) were addressed . for a single receiver ,",
    "the exact super dense coding capacity was determined and it was shown that the senders do not need to apply global unitaries to reach the optimal capacity , but each sender can perform a local encoding on her side . as a result , it was shown that bound entangled states with respect to a bipartite cut between the senders ( alices ) and the receiver ( bob ) are not `` multi '' dense - codeable .",
    "furthermore , a general classification of multipartite quantum states according to their dense - codeability was investigated .",
    "the above multipartite scenarios were discussed for noiseless systems . however , in a realistic super dense coding scheme noise is unavoidably present in the system .",
    "we assume here that noise is present only in the transmission channels and the other apparatuses involved are perfect . in @xcite , the bipartite super dense coding for both correlated and uncorrelated channels was discussed . in the present paper",
    "we generalize those schemes to the multipartite case in the presence of covariant noise .",
    "we investigate the scenario of more than one sender with a single receiver , considering both unitary and non - unitary encoding .",
    "we follow two avenues .",
    "first , we will consider the case where the senders are far apart and can only apply local operations .",
    "second , we will assume that the senders are allowed to perform global operations .",
    "since the amount of classical information that can be extracted from an ensemble of quantum states can be measured by the holevo quantity @xcite , the super dense coding capacity for a given resource state is defined to be the maximal amount of this quantity with respect to the encoding procedure . in the present paper we focus on the optimization problem of the holevo quantity in order to find the super dense coding capacity , considering local ( non)unitary encoding as well as global ( non)unitary encoding .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we first review the mathematical definition of the holevo quantity for an ensemble of multipartite states when the parties are connected through a completely positive trace preserving map ( a noisy channel ) . considering unitary encoding , and a covariant channel , for both scenarios of local and global encoding",
    ", we then find an expression for the super dense coding capacity .",
    "this expression only involves to find a single unitary operator acting on the resource state . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the pauli channel as a typical example of a covariant map .",
    "we then give examples of pauli channels and initial states for which the single unitary operator is explicitly determined . in sec .",
    "iv , considering non - unitary encoding , we derive the multipartite super dense coding capacity in the presence of covariant channels up to a pre - processing on the resource state .",
    "we investigate both local and global encoding .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the pauli channel as particular map . in sec .",
    "v we summarize the main results . finally , in the appendix , we provide proofs for two lemmas reported in the paper .",
    "a quantum channel is a communication channel which can transmit a quantum system and can be used to carry classical information .",
    "if the transfer is undisturbed the channel is noiseless ; if the quantum system interacts with some other external systems ( environment ) , a noisy quantum channel results .",
    "mathematically , a quantum channel can be described as a completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) map acting on the quantum state that is transmitted . considering a noisy transmission channel ,",
    "the multipartite super dense coding scheme works as follows : a given quantum state @xmath0 is distributed between @xmath1 alices and a single bob ( in our scenario , bob s subsystem experiences noise in this stage ) .",
    "then , alices perform with the probability @xmath2 a unitary operation @xmath3 on their side of the state @xmath4 , thus encoding classical information through the state @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the identity operator on the bob s hilbert space and @xmath7 , is a set of indices for alices . subsequently",
    ", the alices send their subsystems of the encoded state through the noisy channel to bob .",
    "we consider @xmath8 to be the cptp map ( quantum channel ) that globally acts on the multipartite encoded state @xmath9 . by this process",
    ", bob receives the ensemble @xmath10 . by performing suitable measurements",
    ", bob can extract the accessible information about this ensemble which is given by the holevo quantity @xcite    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the von neumann entropy , and the logarithm is taken to base two .",
    "the subscript refers to unitary encoding .",
    "the super dense coding capacity @xmath13 for a given resource state @xmath4 and the noisy channel @xmath14 is defined to be the maximum of the holevo quantity @xmath15 with respect to the encoding @xmath16 , i.e.    @xmath17    for an illustration , see fig . 1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     table 1 .",
    "a summary of the solved examples of multipartite resource states and channels for super dense coding . here , some of the unsolved examples are also mentioned .",
    "in a multipartite super dense coding scheme with non - unitary encoding , instead of the unitary operators @xmath3 considered in the previous sections , the alices apply the cptp maps @xmath18 on their side of the shared state @xmath19 and thereby perform the encoding via the states @xmath20 .",
    "the rest of the scheme is similar to the case of unitary encoding .",
    "the alices send the encoded state @xmath21 , with the probability @xmath2 , through the covariant channel to bob .",
    "the super dense coding capacity is then the maximum of the holevo quantity with respect to the cptp maps @xmath22 and the probabilities @xmath2 .",
    "we first consider the case for which the alices are again restricted to local cptp maps @xmath23 .",
    "for this situation , the optimization of the holevo quantity in the presence of a covariant channel is given in the following lemma .",
    "* lemma 3 .",
    "* let    @xmath24    be the holevo quantity with @xmath25 and @xmath26 be a covariant channel .",
    "let @xmath27 be the map that minimizes the von neumann entropy after application of this map and the covariant channel to the initial state @xmath28 .",
    "then the super dense coding capacity @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 . + a proof for this lemma is shown in the appendix .    now ,",
    "if the alices are allowed to perform global operations , with an argument similar to lemma 3 , we can show that the super dense coding capacity is @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is a pre - processing that the alices globally perform on the initial state @xmath35 before applying the optimal local unitary operators @xmath36 .",
    "the pre - processing @xmath34 minimizes the output von neumann entropy after applying it and the channel to the initial state . the capacity ( [ global - non - unitary - commutative ] ) is reachable by the optimal ensemble @xmath37 ( \\tilde{v}_{\\{i\\}}^\\dagger \\otimes{{\\mathbbm{1}}}^\\textmd{b}),\\tilde{p}_{\\{i\\}}=\\frac{1}{d^2_{\\textmd{a}}}\\big\\}.$ ]    similar to unitary encoding , the capacities ( [ 1-local - non - unitary - commutative ] ) and ( [ global - non - unitary - commutative ] ) can be also written for the special case of a pauli channel .",
    "in summary , we discussed in this paper the multipartite super dense coding scenario of many senders and a single receiver in the presence of a covariant channel . considering ( non)unitary encoding , for both cases of local and global encoding , and up to some pre - processing on the resource state , we found expressions for the capacity . in general , the pre - processing is not determined and it is an open question . for unitary encoding , we found examples for which the pre - processing can be determined and turns out to be the identity operator .",
    "for the mentioned examples , alices can not do better than local encoding .",
    "we also showed that for some of these examples alices can not do better than unitary encoding .",
    "these results can be seen as first steps in several directions of future research .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to consider other types of channels rather than pauli channels and also other types of memories",
    ". it would be also interesting to consider the case where we have more than one receiver .",
    "the case of two receivers , for noiseless channels , is discussed in @xcite where some of the alices send their information to the first bob while the others send theirs to the second bob .",
    "the two receivers are restricted to perform local operations and classical communication among themselves . to the best of our knowledge , for this situation",
    "the exact super dense coding capacity is still an open question even for noiseless channels . for bipartite super dense coding",
    ", we showed previously that there are examples for which the non - unitary encoding leads to a better capacity than unitary one .",
    "it is still an open problem to establish whether this can happen also in the multipartite case .",
    "* acknowledgments * : this work was partially supported by deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) and the eu - project corner .",
    ".*proof for lemma 2 : * to prove the lemma , we first show that the statement @xmath38 holds . by using the definition of a bell state @xmath39 for a bell state , we have      where in the last line we have used @xmath41 .",
    "different states @xmath42 have at least one different index for @xmath43 or @xmath44 . then by using eq .",
    "( [ 1358 ] ) , the statement of equation ( [ pre - proof - orthogonal ] ) is proved .",
    "subsequently , we arrive at @xmath45 by using eq .",
    "( [ pre - proof - orthogona2 ] ) , for @xmath46 we have @xmath47 which completes the proof . + * proof for lemma 3 : * with an argument similar to lemma 1 , we first introduce an upper bound on the holevo quantity ( [ holevo - non - unitary ] ) , and in the next step , we show that the bound is attainable . by using the subadditivity of the von neumann entropy , noting that the maximum entropy of a @xmath48-dimensional system is @xmath49 , and since the map @xmath50 gives the minimum output entropy , we have the upper bound      the above bound is reachable by the ensemble @xmath52 ( \\tilde{v}_{\\{i\\}}^\\dagger \\otimes{{\\mathbbm{1}}}^\\textmd{b}),\\tilde{p}_{\\{i\\}}=\\frac{1}{d^2_{\\textmd{a}}}\\big\\ }   $ ] . in other words , the optimal encoding consists of a fixed pre - processing @xmath50 ( [ 3 ] ) and a subsequent unitary encoding @xmath36 .",
    "we recognize @xmath53 as the holevo quantity for the ensemble @xmath54 which is given by        the pre - processing @xmath50 maps the quantum state @xmath35 to another quantum state @xmath56 . by using the decomposition ( [ decomposition - multi ] ) for @xmath57 ,",
    "( [ average - lambda ] ) , and the covariance property of the channel , we find that the first term on the rhs of ( [ optiensemble - non - unitary ] ) is given by @xmath58    using the covariance property of the channel and the invariance of the von neumann entropy under unitary transformations , the second term on the rhs of eq .",
