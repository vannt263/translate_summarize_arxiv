    "double white dwarf ( dwd ) binaries are considered to be one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves for lisa , the proposed laser interferometer space antenna @xcite . if , as has been predicted @xcite , close dwd pairs are the end product of the thermonuclear evolution of a sizeable fraction of all binary systems , then dwd binaries must be quite common in our galaxy and the gravitational waves ( gw ) emitted from these systems",
    "may be a dominant source of background noise for lisa in its lower frequency band , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "dwd binaries are also believed to be ( one of the likely ) progenitors of type ia supernovae @xcite in situations where the accreting white dwarf exceeds the chandrasekhar mass limit , collapses toward nuclear densities , then explodes . because its instruments will have sufficient sensitivity to detect gw radiation from close dwd binaries throughout the volume of our galaxy , lisa will provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to study this important tracer of stellar populations and it will provide us with a much better understanding of the formation and evolution of close binary systems in general .",
    "clearly , a considerable amount of astrophysical insight will be gained from studying the dwd population as a guaranteed source for lisa .    broadly speaking , our galaxy s dwd binary population should be dominated by systems that are in two distinctly different evolutionary phases : an `` inspiral '' phase , during which both stars are detached from their respective roche lobes ; and a semi - detached , `` stable mass - transfer '' phase during which the less massive star fills its roche lobe and is slowly transferring mass to its more massive companion . while dwd binaries may encounter other interesting evolutionary phases  for example , a phase of so - called common envelope evolution , or a phase of rapid , unstable mass transfer  the inspiral and stable mass - transfer phases are expected to dominate the population because they are especially long - lived .",
    "it should be noted that we already have a handle on the size of the galactic population of dwd binaries from optical , uv , and x - ray observations . in the immediate solar neighborhood",
    ", there are 18 systems @xcite known to be undergoing a phase of stable mass transfer ( am cvn being the prototype ) and the eso sn ia progenitor survey ( spy ) has detected nearly 100 detached dwd systems @xcite . at present , orbital periods and the component masses for 24 detached dwd systems have been determined ( see table 3 of @xcite and references therein ) , five of which come from the spy survey . during both of these",
    "relatively long - lived evolutionary phases , a dwd system s orbital period ( and corresponding gw frequency ) changes on a time scale that is governed by the rate at which angular momentum is being lost from the system due to gravitational radiation , that is , the so - called `` chirp '' time scale ( see the discussion associated with eq .",
    "[ tau_chirp ] , below ) .",
    "while the system is detached , the orbital separation slowly decreases so the system should emit a gw signal with a characteristic `` chirp '' signature , that is , the frequency and amplitude of the gw signal should monotonically increase with time . during a phase of stable mass transfer",
    ", however , the orbital separation steadily increases so the gw signal should exhibit an inverse - chirp character where by its frequency and amplitude should steadily decrease with time .",
    "the primary objective of our present study is to analyze the imprint that both of these relatively long - lived phases of evolution will have on our galaxy s dwd binary population , as viewed by lisa .",
    "lisa s capabilities as a gw detector are usually discussed in the context of the @xmath2 diagram , where the gw frequency @xmath0 is measured in hertz , and the gw amplitude @xmath3 is a dimensionless `` strain '' ( generally quoted per @xmath4 , reflecting the frequency resolution of the data stream ) .",
    "a useful analogy can be drawn between this amplitude - frequency diagram and the astronomy community s familiar color - magnitude ( cm ) diagram . directly from photometric measurements , astronomers can produce a cm diagram that is based on the apparent brightness ( the apparent magnitude @xmath5 ) of various sources .",
    "however , a determination of the intrinsic brightness of each source must await the determination of the distance @xmath6 to each source and the corresponding conversion of each measured value of @xmath5 to an absolute magnitude @xmath7 .",
    "lisa s measurement of @xmath8 for a given astrophysical source is analogous to a measurement of @xmath5 ; it only tells us how bright the gw source appears to be on the sky .",
    "a determination of the intrinsic brightness of each gw source must await a determination of the source distance @xmath6 and the corresponding conversion of each measured value of ( the apparent brightness ) @xmath3 to a quantity that represents the `` absolute '' brightness of the source .",
    "for lisa sources , the relevant quantity ( analogous to @xmath7 ) is @xmath9 .",
    "astronomers realize that the underlying physical properties of stars , their evolution , and their relationship to one another in the context of stellar populations can only be ascertained from a cm diagram if @xmath7 , rather than @xmath5 , is used to quantify stellar magnitudes . by analogy",
    ", it should be clear that the underlying physical properties of dwd systems , their evolution , and their relationship to one another in the context of stellar populations can be ascertained only if the observational properties of such systems are displayed in a @xmath10 diagram , rather than in a plot of @xmath8 versus @xmath11 .",
    "for this reason , our discussion of dwd systems will be presented in the context of this more fundamental , but rather under - utilized , `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency domain .",
    "as we investigate the evolution of dwd systems across lisa s `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency domain , we will utilize a simplified description of the two long - lived evolutionary phases mentioned above .",
    "we will assume ( 1 ) all orbits are circular ; ( 2 ) the orbital frequency is related to the orbital separation via kepler s third law ; ( 3 ) the spin of both stars can be ignored so that each system s total angular momentum is given by the point - mass expression for orbital angular momentum ; ( 4 ) the total mass of each system is conserved ; and ( 5 ) angular momentum is lost from each system only via the radiation of gravitational waves and that the rate of angular momentum loss is correctly described by a quadrupole radiation formula .",
    "simplification # 4 means , for example , that after the low - mass white dwarf comes into contact with its roche lobe , we will assume that each dwd system evolves along a `` conservative '' mass transfer ( cmt ) trajectory , and simplification # 5 means that we will be ignoring effects that might arise due to direct - impact accretion @xcite . a more thorough analysis that removes some or all of these simplifications is likely to provide additional valuable insight into the evolution of dwd populations ; @xcite , for example ,",
    "have expressed concern that the time - rate - of - change of the gw frequency for many of lisa s most interesting sources will not be correctly interpreted without a proper treatment of tides . in this context , our analysis should be viewed as an important first step in what is likely to be a long - term study of the evolution of the dwd binary population across lisa s `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency domain . at the outset",
    ", we acknowledge that our understanding of this subject has benefitted significantly from the insight of others whose work has preceded ours ; most notably , we recognize the insightful publications by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in the quadrupole approximation @xcite , the time - dependent gravitational - wave strain , @xmath12 , generated by a point mass binary system in circular orbit has two polarization states .",
    "the plus and cross polarizations of @xmath12 generically take the respective forms , , we will assume that the binary system is being viewed `` face on '' so that the measured peak - to - peak amplitude of the two polarization states are equal and at their maximum value , given by @xmath13 .",
    "if the orbit is inclined to our line of sight , the inclination angle can be determined as long as a measurement is obtained of both polarization states as shown , for example , by @xcite . because our discussion focuses on galactic dwd binaries , we ignore the effects of cosmological expansion . ]",
    "@xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] , where the time - dependent phase angle , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the phase at time @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the frequency of the gravitational wave measured in hz , @xmath20 is the angular velocity of the binary orbit given in radians per second , and the characteristic amplitude of the wave , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gravitational constant , @xmath23 is the speed of light , @xmath6 is the distance to the source , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the masses of the two stars , and @xmath26 is the distance between the stars . if the principal parameters of the binary system do not change with time , then @xmath0 and @xmath13 will both be constants and the phase angle @xmath27 will vary only linearly in time , so the source will emit ( monochromatic ) `` continuous - wave '' radiation . if , however , any of the binary parameters  @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , or @xmath20  vary with time , then @xmath13 and/or @xmath0 will also vary with time in accordance with the physical process that causes the variation . here",
    "we will only be considering the evolution of dwd systems in which the basic system parameters vary on a timescale that is long compared to @xmath28 .",
    "we know from the mass - radius relationship for white dwarfs ( see the discussion associated with eq .  [ mass_radius ] , below ) that the less massive star in a dwd binary will always have the larger radius . therefore , in a dwd system that is undergoing mass transfer , we can be certain that the less massive star is the component that is filling its roche lobe and is transferring ( donating ) mass to its companion ( the more massive , accretor ) . with this in mind ,",
    "throughout the remainder of our discussion we will identify the two stars by the subscripts @xmath29 ( for donor ) and @xmath26 ( for accretor ) , rather than by the less descript subscripts @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and will always recognize that the subscript @xmath29 identifies the less massive star in the dwd system .",
    "this notation will be used even during evolutionary phases ( such as a gr - driven inspiral phase ) when the two stars are detached and therefore no mass - transfer is taking place .",
    "furthermore , we will frequently refer to the total mass of the system , @xmath32 and the mass ratio , @xmath33 which will necessarily be confined to the range @xmath34 because @xmath35 .",
    "also , it will be understood that the limiting mass for either white dwarf is the chandrasekhar mass , @xmath36 .",
    "as mentioned above , throughout this investigation we will assume that kepler s third law provides a fundamental relationship between the angular velocity and the separation of dwd binaries , that is , @xmath37 relation ( [ kepler ] ) allows us to replace either @xmath20 or @xmath26 in favor of the other parameter in eq .",
    "( [ hnorm ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we will find it useful to interchange one or both of these parameters with the binary system s orbital angular momentum @xmath38 where , @xmath39 is the ratio of the system s reduced mass to its total mass . for our future discussion , it is useful to express the gravitational wave amplitude @xmath13 and frequency @xmath0 in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "when @xmath46 drops below @xmath160 [ based on the function @xmath79 , this will only happen along curves for which @xmath161 , each curve climbs back above @xmath159 , reflecting the fact that eq .",
    "( [ pac_q_manuscript ] ) admits two solutions over the relevant range of mass ratios .",
    "this , in turn , implies that for mass - transferring dwd systems that have @xmath162 , a measurement of @xmath117 will generate two possible solutions  rather than a unique solution  for the pair of key physical parameters @xmath163 .",
    "once lisa has measured @xmath117 as well as @xmath0 for a given dwd system , figure [ fig : ffdot_pac ] provides a graphical means of determining the values of @xmath44 and @xmath46 for the system , assuming it is undergoing a phase of stable cmt .",
    "we do not expect that lisa will probe the entire parameter space depicted in this figure , however . as discussed above",
    ", we expect that lisa will only be able to detect frequency changes in systems for which @xmath164 .",
    "using expression ( [ to - csimple ] ) , this means that lisa will only be able to measure @xmath117 for systems that have , @xmath165 the dashed black line in figure [ fig : ffdot_pac ] with a slope of @xmath166 that is labeled `` @xmath167 '' shows this boundary ; the parameter regime that can be effectively probed by lisa lies above and to the right of this line .",
    "once the distance has been determined to individual lisa sources , as was outlined in  [ q_and_mtot ] , it will be possible to place them in an `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency diagram , that is , in a @xmath168 diagram .",
    "the location of individual sources in such a diagram should help us understand a great deal about our galaxy s dwd population .",
    "our expectation is that systems in different evolutionary states will fall into several distinct sub - domains of lisa s `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency diagram , and the diagram will exhibit natural zones of avoidance as well .",
    "our models of inspiral and cmt systems permit us to predict where the boundaries will lie between these various population sub - domains .",
    "as depicted in figure [ conclusion_figure ] , the principal sub - domains can be identified as follows .",
    "* _ zones of avoidance _ : no dwd systems will be found in the region above the boundary line that is defined by an inspiral trajectory with @xmath51 ; according to eq .",
    "( [ h_f_relationship ] ) , this boundary is defined by the expression , @xmath169 also , no dwd systems will be found in the region below the bounding curve that is defined by the inspiral termination boundary for systems with @xmath84 ; over the region of parameter space shown in figure [ conclusion_figure ] this bounding curve is given approximately by the expression , @xmath170 both of these population boundaries have been drawn as solid red curves in figure [ conclusion_figure ] .",
    "detached , inspiraling dwd systems will be found throughout the domain whose upper and lower borders are defined , respectively , by boundary curves * a * and * b*. this region of parameter space can be subdivided into the following two principal population sub - domains .",
    "* _ region i _ : only inspiraling dwd systems will be found in the region of parameter space that is bounded above by curve * a * and below by the locus of points that identifies semi - detached systems for which @xmath171 ( the green solid curve in figure [ conclusion_figure ] ) ; over the region of parameter space shown in figure [ conclusion_figure ] , this curve is given approximately by the expression , @xmath172 * _ region ii _ : mass - transferring dwd systems will only be found in the region of parameter space that is bounded above by curve * c * and below by curve * b*.      * _ region iii _ : an inspiraling dwd system that has @xmath108 value will encounter an unstable  rather than a stable  phase of mass - transfer when the less massive star initially makes contact with its roche lobe .",
    "the region of parameter space in which these systems will be found at the onset of mass - transfer is bounded below by curve * b * and above by two intersecting curve segments : at @xmath173 , curve * c * defines the upper boundary ; for @xmath174 , the relevant upper boundary has been drawn as a blue solid curve in figure [ conclusion_figure ] and is given approximately by the expression , @xmath175 * _ region iv _ : dwd systems that enter a phase of stable cmt with a total system mass @xmath75 will be found in a region of parameter space that is bounded above by curve * c * and below by two intersecting curve segments : for @xmath176 , curve * d * defines the lower boundary ; for @xmath177 , the relevant lower boundary has been drawn as a pink solid curve in figure [ conclusion_figure ] and is given approximately by the expression , @xmath178 boundary curve * e * is defined by the stable cmt trajectory for a system with @xmath179 .    an additional demarcation line has been drawn in figure [ conclusion_figure ] that is associated with the @xmath180 yr boundary .",
    "this `` time boundary '' line * t * is defined by setting @xmath181 and @xmath125 yr in eq .",
    "( [ to - cexpression ] ) , that is , it is given by the expression , @xmath182 lisa will be unable to determine distances to dwd systems that lie below and to the left of this demarcation line because their orbital periods and associated gw frequencies are changing so slowly that lisa will be unable to measure with confidence the value of @xmath117 for these systems .",
    "studies of dwd populations will therefore benefit most from the data that lisa collects on systems that lie above and to the right of boundary line * t*.",
    "the segment of this line that bounds _ region ii _ has been drawn as a dashed line to emphasize that it is only an approximate one year boundary for mass - transferring systems .",
    "the particular boundaries * a*-*e * of the population domains that are depicted in figure [ conclusion_figure ] arise as a consequence of the specific mass - radius relationship ( eq .  [ mass_radius ] ) and , hence , the equation of state that we have chosen to use to describe the structure of individual white dwarfs . because it is generally believed that the mass - radius relationship given in eq.([mass_radius ] ) represents the properties of white dwarfs quite well , we expect that the population sub - domains and zones of avoidance shown in figure [ conclusion_figure ] will map well onto lisa s observationally determined `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency diagram .",
    "systems that are found on the `` wrong '' side of a given boundary  for example , any system that lies in one of the zones of avoidance , or cmt systems that are found in region i  will be of particular interest because they may provide evidence that the equation of state that we adopted is not general enough to properly describe this stellar population two examples suffice to illustrate this point .",
    "first , in the presence of tidal stresses , the donor stars in mass - transferring dwd systems may be hotter than assumed here @xcite , which will affect the frequency at which the donor fills the roche lobe .",
    "consequently , the inspiral termination boundary * b * in figure 3 will change .",
    "second , because individual neutron stars obey an entirely different mass - radius relationship and generally seem to have masses @xmath183 , inspiraling double neutron - star systems will likely be distinguishable from dwd systems because they will lie in the zone of avoidance above boundary curve * a * , as defined above .",
    "dwd systems that are undergoing a phase of stable , cmt and that are found to reside in region iv of the `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency diagram can be identified as progenitors of type ia supernovae .",
    "efforts to better understand the origin of supernova explosions in old stellar populations will especially benefit from follow - up studies that identify the optical ( or uv or x - ray ) counterparts to these region iv systems . inspiraling systems that are found to reside in region iii may prove to be equally interesting candidates for follow - up studies .",
    "detached dwd systems in region iii are destined to enter a phase of unstable mass transfer ( likely accompanied by super - eddington accretion , see @xcite ) that will significantly transform the system s properties on a dynamical , rather than a chirp , timescale .",
    "such rapid mass - transfer events may lead to merger of the binary components , perhaps followed by an explosion .    as stated above , we are confident that the population sub - domains and zones of avoidance shown in figure [ conclusion_figure ] will map well onto lisa s observationally determined `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency diagram .",
    "we are less confident about the degree to which lisa s measurements of @xmath117 will match the values that are predicted by our simplified model of the slow , orbit - averaged time - evolution of dwd systems ( as displayed , for example , in figure [ fig : ffdot_pac ] ) .",
    "mass - transferring binary systems , in particular , are notoriously messy laboratories .",
    "for example , significant and unexplained variations in the mass - transfer rate can arise in an individual system over times that are much shorter than the gr - driven evolutionary time scale ; this can introduce significant short - term variations in @xmath117 .",
    "also , magnetic fields can be effective at carrying away mass and angular momentum from a system , thereby violating our assumption of conservative mass transfer .",
    "v407 vul and rx j0806 + 1527 @xcite provide perhaps the best examples of the type of confusion that is likely to arise when attempts are made to extract measurements of @xmath117 from a one - year - long lisa data stream .",
    "these are optically identified , mass - transferring binaries that are thought to be dwd systems because their orbital periods are less than ten minutes .",
    "the best available measurements of period variation in both of these systems indicate that their orbits are slowly shrinking , rather than slowing growing larger as would be predicted by our model of stable cmt .",
    "although , in the mean , the long - term evolutionary behavior of these systems is likely to agree with the predictions of our model , fluctuations about the mean that occur on a timescale that is short compared to @xmath110 may totally confound our ability to interpret lisa s measurements of @xmath117 . on the bright side , if a significant number of lisa sources exhibit noticeable deviations away from the mean behavior predicted by our simplified model , in the end we are likely to gain a more complete understanding of the evolution of such systems .",
    "we acknowledge numerous very useful discussions that we have had with j. frank , v. gokhale , p. motl , and x. peng about the evolutionary behavior of dwd systems .",
    "we appreciate the encouragement that we received from s. larson and m. benacquista to push this work to completion after they reviewed a preliminary presentation of our population boundary diagram .",
    "we also appreciate the advice of an anonymous referee , who urged us to shorten the original manuscript making our key point more succinctly .",
