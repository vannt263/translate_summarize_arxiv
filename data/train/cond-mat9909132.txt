    "friction and its microscopic origins have been intensively investigated in recent years.@xcite progress in atomic force microscopy ( afm ) has made possible precise force measurements at the atomic scale.@xcite these data , together with simulations , theory and _ ab initio _ force calculations have helped to provide a detailed picture of friction .",
    "@xcite much of this work is concerned with the nature and rate of energy transfer from lubricant layers or asperities into bulk substrates .",
    "the understanding of such processes has implications as far - ranging as the design of solar collectors,@xcite where collected energy must be transferred to the bulk before reemission to the surroundings ; to the understanding of reactions in living cells catalyzed on small surfaces,@xcite as well as biomolecular motors;@xcite and to the design of lubricants for industrial purposes.@xcite in many cases , friction is the result of energy dissipation by multiphonon processes .",
    "we address in this article energy dissipation in a stick - slip model for friction involving small and sparsely distributed adsorbates on a surface .",
    "we determine the nature and calculate the rate of damping of the adsorbed molecule , nanoparticle or asperity following the slip step .",
    "relaxation processes of adsorbates have been studied both theoretically and experimentally ( see eg .",

    "if @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the maximum phonon frequency of the sample , the excitations can decay only by the creation of @xmath3 phonons in the sample @xcite . for large @xmath3 ,",
    "this contribution is in general negligible .",
    "thus for small particles on a solid substrate , for which the vibrational frequency of the adsorbate might be much higher than the band of substrate mode frequencies , energy dissipation from the adsorbate into the substrate may be quite slow .",
    "for such cases , anharmonic coupling between the adsorbate and substrate gives rise to energy flow into the substrate .",

    "we vary the adsorbate frequency @xmath0 from @xmath68 up to @xmath69 , and take the iteration step to be @xmath70 .    in fig .",
    "[ et ] , we have plotted the decay profiles , @xmath71 , i.e. , the time - dependent energy in the adsorbate mode over its initial energy , for various values of the adsorbate frequency , @xmath0 . in each case",

    "the exponential character of the decay is clear . for the numerical calculations",

    "this caused the matrix elements at the edges to evolve incorrectly .",
    "however , as long as they are negligible compared to the matrix elements corresponding to the first few excited states , this does not affect the general profile of the time dependence of the energy , which is mainly determined by the evolution of the first few diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "in most cases after 300 iterations the matrix elements at the edge become nonnegligible . in all cases",
    ", we found that the excess energy can be fit almost perfectly to the expression e(t ) = e(0 ) e^- , where @xmath74 . here , @xmath75 is the decay time constant ( or the relaxation time ) .    in fig .",

    "we note that our calculations only include cubic anharmonic coupling of the adsorbate to the substrate .",
    "this is reasonable when @xmath77 .",
    "when the adsorbate frequency is smaller than the debye frequency , indicated in the figure , the plotted @xmath75 will be too large , since we have neglected linear coupling terms , which are important when @xmath78 .",
    "we nevertheless include the regime where @xmath78 to show how the cubic anharmonic contribution to @xmath75 varies in this regime , though the focus of this study is where the adsorbate frequency lies outside the band of substrate frequencies .",
    "we see that both for large @xmath0 and small @xmath0 , @xmath75 diverges . in the large @xmath0 limit ,",
    "the reason is due to the phase space factors ; the two phonons created or absorbed have to be in a band of width @xmath79 which goes to zero as @xmath80 . for @xmath81",
    ", the adsorbed atom can not decay through the emission of two phonons and one has to consider three or more phonon processes . in the small @xmath0 limit",
    ", the coupling constant @xmath82 becomes very small and the system behaves almost as if it is isolated , and can not decay . in fig .",
    "[ td ] , one also sees that in the region @xmath83 there is an interesting variation in @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath84 there is a contribution to the decay process whereby the adsorbate absorbs a low energy phonon from the sample which unites with an adsorbate phonon to emit a high energy phonon into the sample .",
    "this process is absent when @xmath85 , which causes @xmath75 to rise when @xmath0 exceeds @xmath86 .",
    "we note that this rise , followed by a drop in @xmath75 with larger @xmath0 , is not affected by the neglect of linear coupling terms since this interesting nonmonotonic variation of @xmath75 with @xmath0 occurs where the adsorbate frequency is higher than the band of substrate frequencies .",
    "in this work , we developed a formalism based on the reduced density matrix to study the dissipation of excess energy of an adsorbate into a substrate in the framework of a stick - slip model for dry friction .",
    "our focus was on adsorbate frequencies that lie outside the band of substrate frequencies . in this case",
    ", anharmonic coupling between the adsorbate and the substrate controls the rate of energy dissipation , and we introduced cubic terms explicitly in our calculations .",
    "this work presents an extension and generalization of earlier work in which a golden rule formula was used to calculate the rate of energy dissipation from an adsorbate following the slip step.@xcite in that work , the adsorbate was linearly coupled to the substrate , and anharmonic terms were not considered . in this article , we found that excess energy decays essentially exponentially from the adsorbate into the substrate , using the reduced density matrix formalism with anharmonic coupling and a range of parameters that include those for co adsorbed on a cu substrate at room temperature .",
    "previously , we assumed exponential decay in adopting the golden rule . here",
    ", we have developed a more general formalism that yields exponential decay for the systems we have investigated at room temperature .",
    "our work provides an atomic scale theory explaining how and how fast energy dissipates in a stick - slip model for friction when adsorbates are both small and sparsely distributed .",
    "when the adsorbate is small , the adsorbate frequency may lie outside the band of substrate frequencies , and the anharmonic terms that we explicitly take into account here will lead to energy dissipation . because the adsorbates are distributed sparsely over the substrate , we can neglect the interactions among adsorbates in addressing the energy dissipation from each one . the model we have presented fits very well to friction force microscopy .",
    "our work complements a number of important recent studies that address energy dissipation by phonons through films of lubricants@xcite and through the collective motion of asperities,@xcite systems where the interactions of the physisorbed or chemisorbed adsorbates give rise to collective excitations involved in friction .",
