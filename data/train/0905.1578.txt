    "analytical fits to halo mass functions ( e.g. jenkins et  al . 2001 ) and average mass accretion histories of individual haloes of a given mass at the present epoch ( e.g. van den bosch 2002 ) are now available .",
    "in addition , the density and temperature structure of dark matter haloes has been studied extensively using numerical simulations .",
    "observable galaxy properties are due to the baryonic component of these structures .",
    "white & rees ( 1978 ) suggested that haloes accrete baryonic matter along with the dark matter .",
    "the baryons are shock heated to the virial temperature of the halo , @xmath4 , and thermalization of dark matter particles supports the halo from further collapse . as the hot gas cools , it is no longer supported by radiative pressure , and sinks to the centre of the halo potential . once cold , the gas suffers from the gravitational instability , and collapses to form stars ( kennicutt 1989 ) .    while very attractive , this picture is at odds with the observable galaxy properties . in the hierarchical assembly paradigm",
    "lower mass galaxies form first , and it is the most massive galaxies that should be undergoing vigorous star formation at the present epoch .",
    "however , observations ( e.g. silk 2002 and references therein ) show these massive galaxies to be systematically redder ( as calculated from their optical colours ) , implying stars in these systems are older , than their less massive counterparts .",

    "further evidence for suppression of star formation in massive galaxies comes from observations of the local optical luminosity function . under the assumption of a constant mass - to - light ratio , the number counts of the most massive and least massive galaxies are significantly overpredicted when compared with observations ( baugh  2006 ; eke et  al .",
    "while reionization and supernovae feedback provide sufficient heating to reconcile counts at the faint end of the luminosity function , this is insufficient in the most massive galaxies .",

    "the cores of galaxy clusters are dense , and hence the gas there has very short cooling times compared to the hubble time .",
    "this originally led to the idea of a cooling flow , and the expectation of large amounts of cold gas being deposited in such cores .",
    "however , recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ spectroscopic observations ( tamura et  al . 2001 ; peterson et  al . 2003 ) have found no evidence of x - ray gas cooling below @xmath7 , suggesting a temperature floor of about 1  kev .",
    "numerous scenarios have been envisaged in attempts to explain these observations .",
    "it has been argued that the gas may be cooling , but the line emission is either absorbed , or greatly diminished through intrinsic x - ray absorption @xcite , or due to the presence of multiphase gas and inhomogeneity of iron abundance @xcite .",
    "an alternative to hiding the signatures of cooling gas is some form of non - gravitational heating .    in order to offset the cooling in cluster cores ,",
    "such heating must come from a central source .",

    "while encouraging , these approaches do not provide a realistic representation of the interaction between the radio jets and the surrounding gas .",
    "the aforementioned authors have to a large degree built into their models factors that guarantee the success of the agn feedback process .",
    "thus , whether or not radio galaxies really can provide sufficient heating to quench gas cooling by the required amount remains an open question .",
    "we address this issue by developing and applying a galaxy evolution model that , for the first time , incorporates detailed and physically motivated , radio source feedback .",
    "agn feedback is an inherently intermittent process .",
    "heating of the intracluster gas ( icm ) decreases the rate of accretion onto the central black hole , until it is shut off completely ( e.g. shabala et  al . 2008 ) .",
    "once the gas has had sufficient time to cool , the accretion can restart .",
    "it has been suggested ( jester 2005 and references therein ) that accretion processes in galactic x - ray black hole binaries ( bhxbs ) are analogous to those in agns , albeit on much shorter timescales .",
    "at least two different accretion states are observed in bhxbs ; these are characterised by different spectral shapes and luminosities . the high luminosity / soft x - ray ( thermal ) spectrum state is identified with the standard shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) thin accretion disk .",

    "the low luminosity / hard x - ray spectrum state is identified with an optically thin accretion flow .",
    "the cooling times are long and trapped radiation is advected inward , resulting in a `` puffed '' disk @xcite .",
    "the resulting quasi - spherical advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1995 ) is thus radiatively inefficient , and the bhxb is observed in a low luminosity state .",
    "radio jets are only observed in the adaf phase , with quenching occurring when the bhxb enters the high / soft ( i.e. thin disk ) state @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a galaxy evolution model that includes intermittent radio source feedback . in our model ,",
    "existence of radio jets depends on the nature of the accretion flow solution , which in turn is sensitive to the interplay between cooling and heating of the cluster gas .",

    "however , at @xmath5 the cooling rate becomes high enough for radio source feedback to become important . from that point",
    "it is agn feedback that dominates the cooling history of the halo .",
    "contributions of individual feedback components to halting the build - up of stellar mass are shown in figure  [ fig : paper_mstarsmhalo ] .",
    "feedback from supernovae and reionization is dominant in low - mass ( @xmath132  ) haloes , while star formation is significantly impaired by agn feedback in massive haloes .      both the rest - frame uv flux used to derive star - formation rates , and optical and infra - red emission tracking the integrated stellar mass",

    "fortunately , the rest - frame near infra - red _ k_-band luminosity function is almost a magnitude less sensitive to dust extinction than at other wavelengths @xcite , making it a very useful probe of stellar mass .",
    "the main uncertainty in converting between stellar masses and luminosities therefore comes from the adopted imf .",
    "the standard relation frequently used is the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf given by @xmath133 derived for solar neighbourhood stars .",
    "it has recently been argued , however , that field stars do not provide a good proxy for the low - mass end of the imf @xcite due to the sensitivity of the derived mass function to star formation histories at these masses , as well as being at odds with h@xmath2 luminosities of galaxy populations @xcite .",
    "studies of star clusters and galaxies suggest that a `` universal '' imf ( in a statistical sense ) may be applicable @xcite . to this end , a number of models have been put forward .",

    "low mass haloes are much more abundant than their higher mass counterparts- for example , @xmath63   haloes are five orders of magnitude more abundant than @xmath130   ones @xcite . since massive haloes host the more massive galaxies , however , the question of how the total stellar mass is distributed between haloes is a non - trivial one .",

    "it is worth noting that , due to the assumed imf , these are close to the upper limits on the actual star - formation rates at each epoch , and the actual sfrs can be up to 0.35 dex lower than these values .      with supernovae feedback efficiency fixed ,",
    "the fraction of gas accreted onto the central black hole can be determined by invoking known observed relations between the mass of the central black hole and global halo and galaxy properties .",

    "although this fraction is likely to vary between objects ( in particular , satellites are more likely to be disk - dominated than cd galaxies ) , one would expect such bulge estimates to be reasonably accurate because of the dominant contribution of the central galaxy to the stellar mass budget .    due to the self - regulatory nature of the feedback processes , even in the presence of agn feedback the nature of the @xmath144 relation at the high - mass end",
    "is not expected to be altered substantially .",
    "rather , one would expect both the black hole and bulge mass to be reduced by a similar factor relative to the no - feedback case .",

    "it is worth noting that the value of the scaling constant describing the strength of agn feedback ( @xmath151 in croton et  al.s equation 10 ) is different to the value obtained by those authors .",
    "this is a result of the differing model implementations .",
    "since both models reproduce the observed local stellar mass function , the stellar masses for each halo at the present epoch are in agreement ( left panel ) .",

    "the accretion rate falls for the first time below @xmath147 , triggering a powerful jet episode and resultant intermittent activity .",
    "the interplay between gas heating , cooling and ejection by powerful agn outbursts is crucial to explaining both the observed duty cycle of radio galaxies and quasars ( shabala et  al .",

    "figure  [ fig : paper_constrain_mdotdown_lfandmf ] shows that the model can explain the observed dearth of massive galaxies and match the stellar mass function at the present epoch .",
    "it must also reproduce the observed local correlation between black hole mass and global properties such as spheroid mass .",
    "this is plotted in figure  [ fig : paper_mbhvsmhalo ] .    although the final stellar and black hole masses in each halo are lower than when feedback is not included , these clearly grow `` in step '' , with the slope of the final relation remaining unchanged .",
    "thus radio source heating provides a self - regulatory mechanism that can simultaneously limit the growth of the central black hole and the bulge by a similar amount .",

    "the no - agn predictions are also plotted for comparison . as argued in section  [ sec : effhalo_sfr ] , models without agn feedback significantly overpredict the global star formation rate density at the present epoch .",
    "inclusion of such feedback , on the other hand , provides results that are in good agreement with observations .    integrating the predicted local stellar mass function yields a total present - day stellar mass density of @xmath157  mpc@xmath158 , or @xmath159 .",

    "the integral of the predicted star formation rate density over the hubble time is @xmath162 , since a fraction @xmath65 of stars terminate in supernovae .",
    "a successful galaxy formation model must correctly describe the evolution of the galactic population , while simultaneously matching the local observable properties such as the mass function .",
    "this has traditionally proved very difficult , with most models either reproducing the large number of massive galaxies at high redshift but significantly overpredicting the bright end of the local luminosity function ( e.g. kauffmann et  al .",

    "the last two panels of figure  [ fig : paper_mfvsz ] illustrate that the model consistently underpredicts galaxy counts at @xmath165 .",

    "the physical motivation for two different imfs comes from a change in the dominant star formation mechanism with cosmic epoch . at high redshifts star formation",

    "there are two possible causes of this .",
    "one possibility would be current implementations of supernovae feedback truncating star formation too early .",

    "it is clear that the high - mass end of the local stellar mass function is assembled at @xmath139 , while lower - mass objects continue forming stars until the present day .",

    "there are three related reasons for the preferential suppression of star formation in massive galaxies at low redshift .",
    "firstly , lower densities in the low-@xmath167 universe mean the ratio of cooling time to free - fall time is higher there than at high @xmath167 , making agn feedback more effective at low redshifts",
    ". furthermore , black holes are more massive at low @xmath167 , allowing higher jet powers to be generated by adaf disks ( equation  [ eqn : qjetadaf ] ) .",
    "apart from providing greater shock heating , this also introduces an additional mechanism of star formation suppression via gas ejection by powerful radio sources @xcite .",
    "the absence of this mode of feedback in the presented model is most likely responsible for the disagreement between model predictions and observations in intermediate and massive galaxies and at low @xmath167 .",
    "a final illustration of radio source heating giving rise to a massive , red population of galaxies is given in figure  [ fig : paper_meanstellarage ] . here the mean mass- and luminosity - weighted stellar ages at the present epoch are plotted as a function of galaxy stellar mass .",
    "results for a model with no agn , but including gas cooling , and reionization and supernovae feedback are also shown for comparison . in the absence of any feedback the most massive galaxies host the youngest stars , and hence are blue , as expected from the standard hierarchical formation models .",
    "the situation changes dramatically when radio source heating is introduced , with galaxies more massive than @xmath129   at @xmath20 containing older stars than predicted by the no - agn case .",
