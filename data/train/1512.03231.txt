    "[ fig8 ] the threshold and frustration temperature against the transverse component of the heisenberg intra - triangle coupling @xmath17 for several fixed values of its longitudinal component @xmath8 .",
    "it is quite apparent from this comparison that the threshold and frustration temperatures coincide at low enough temperatures , because they both converge to the identical zero - temperature asymptotic limit though they show completely different behavior at higher temperatures .",
    "it can be also understood from fig .",

    "another interesting point is that the reentrance in the threshold temperatures gives rise to the thermal entanglement above the unfrustrated parameter space for @xmath114 [ see fig .

    "the panel ( a ) shows reentrant behavior of the threshold temperature and the panel ( b ) reentrant behavior of the frustration temperature.,title=\"fig : \" ]      next , it could be quite interesting to answer the question whether or not the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg tube may violate the bell inequality , because the entanglement and non - locality capture closely related but independent features of quantum correlations .",
    "a comprehensive analysis reveals that all three available ground state do not violate the bell inequality , since the calculated value of the bell function never exceeds the largest value @xmath115 allowed for classical correlations . to support this statement ,",
    "we have depicted in fig . [",
    "fig9](a ) typical temperature variations of the bell function for three different sets of the heisenberg intra - triangle interaction , which drive the investigated model to the caf , sqt and dca ground states , respectively .",
    "altogether , it could be concluded that quantum correlations are in the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg tube strictly local in spite of the fact that the thermal entanglement is evidently present within the sqt ground state .",
    "the cuspate dip of the bell function at the temperature @xmath116 of the particular case with the caf ground states thus represents the most striking feature of the displayed dependences .",
    "a presence of this kind of singularity can be attributed to a crossing of absolute values of the transverse and longitudinal pair correlation function between the spins from the same heisenberg triangle , which indicates according to eq .",

    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) that the specific heat can exhibit a peculiar double - peak temperature dependence when the sqt phase constitutes the ground state , whereas the low - temperature peak predominantly comes from thermally - induced breakdown of the longitudinal correlation between the spins from the neighboring triangles .",
    "note furthermore that the low - temperature peak gradually merges with the round high - temperature maximum , which shifts to lower temperatures when the spin system approaches the ground - state phase boundary between the sqt and caf phases ( at @xmath120 when @xmath121 is fixed ) .     and several values of its transverse component @xmath17 .",
    "the selected coupling constants @xmath17 are consistent with the following ground states : ( a ) sqt phase ; ( b ) caf phase ; ( c ) dca phase.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and several values of its transverse component @xmath17 .",
    "the selected coupling constants @xmath17 are consistent with the following ground states : ( a ) sqt phase ; ( b ) caf phase ; ( c ) dca phase.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and several values of its transverse component @xmath17 .",
    "the selected coupling constants @xmath17 are consistent with the following ground states : ( a ) sqt phase ; ( b ) caf phase ; ( c ) dca phase.,title=\"fig : \" ]    contrary to this , the specific heat shows a more common temperature dependence with a single maximum in a majority of the parameter space , which corresponds to the caf ground state [ fig . [ fig10](b ) ] .",
    "the only notable exception from this rule is when the heisenberg intra - triangle coupling drives the spin system sufficiently close to the ground - state phase boundary with the dca phase at @xmath122 assuming the fixed value of @xmath102 ( see the subsequent paragraph ) .",
    "last but not least , one recovers the more striking double - peak temperature dependence of the specific heat on assumption that the dca phase constitutes the ground state [ fig . [ fig10](c ) ] . under this condition ,",

    "[ fig11](a)-(b ) .",
    "the triple - peak thermal dependence of the zero - field specific heat can be found when the heisenberg intra - triangle coupling drives the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg tube towards the caf ground state but still keeps it in a close vicinity of the phase boundary with the dca phase ( at @xmath122 for @xmath102 ) . while thermal excitations of physically different origin are responsible for an existence of the high - temperature maximum at @xmath126 , the round maximum at moderate temperatures @xmath127 relates to a gradual decline of the longitudinal and transverse correlations between the spins from the same triangle .",
    "the most surprising is of course a presence of the sizable low - temperature peak , which could be at first sight easily confused with a temperature - driven first - order phase transition .",
    "the sharp and very narrow low - temperature peak , which emerges around the temperature @xmath128 by considering the particular case with @xmath124 and @xmath102 , can be ascribed to massive thermal excitations from the two - fold degenerate caf ground state to the macroscopically degenerate dca excited state . as a matter of fact",
    ", the locus of the sharp low - temperature peak is in a good concordance with the formula @xmath129 which follows from a direct comparison of the helmholtz free energies of the caf and dca phases provided that thermal variations of the internal energy and entropy are simply neglected .",
    "thus , it could be concluded that the sharp low - temperature peak of the specific heat appears due to a high entropy gain , which originates from the chiral degrees of freedom of the dca phase lying in energy just slightly above the doubly degenerate caf ground state . to support this statement ,",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig11](c ) the relevant thermal variations of the entropy , which provides a convincing evidence for an abrupt but still continuous change of the entropy from almost zero to @xmath130 associated with the vigorous thermal excitations from the caf phase to the dca phase .",
    "the abrupt entropy change can be detected at the temperature , which is in accordance with the position of the sharp low - temperature peak of the specific heat given by the formula ( [ peak ] ) .",
    "in the present work , we have exactly solved the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg three - leg tube by taking advantage of the local conservation of the total spin on each heisenberg spin triangle and the classical transfer - matrix method .",
    "the elaborated rigorous procedure has enabled us to derive exact results for the ground - state phase diagram , basic thermodynamic quantities and several pair correlation functions , which were subsequently employed for a calculation of the concurrence and bell function .",
    "the latter two quantities were used in order to quantify thermal entanglement and non - locality , which are related to quantum correlations between two spins coupled by the heisenberg intra - triangle interaction .",
    "while none of three available ground states violates the bell inequality , the sqt phase with a regular alternation of the symmetric quantum superposition of up - up - down and down - down - up on odd and even triangles ( or vice versa ) does exhibit the thermal entanglement .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the sqt and dca ground states are naturally frustrated unlike the unfrustrated caf ground state , above which the so - called thermally activated spin frustration can develop provided that the antiferromagnetic intra - triangle interaction @xmath101 is considered .",
    "we have rigorously calculated the frustration temperature delimiting the unfrustrated region from the frustrated one , which was subsequently compared with the threshold temperature of a disappearance of the thermal entanglement .",
    "it has been verified that the frustration and threshold temperatures coincide at sufficiently low temperatures though they exhibit a very different at higher temperatures . moreover",
    ", it turns out that the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg three - leg tube is thermally entangled just in the frustrated region , which implies that the frustration represents indispensable ground for a presence of the thermal entanglement in this spin system .",
    "note furthermore that the lines of threshold and frustration temperatures may display a reentrant phenomenon though both reentrances are antagonistic and can not appear simultaneously .",
    "hence , the famous dictum that quantum correlations are gradually suppressed through thermal fluctuations is not of general validity , because thermal fluctuations can alternatively act against classical spin arrangements and thus leaving more space to an emergence of the thermal entanglement above a classical ground state .",
    "the most interesting finding stemming from our study certainly represents an extraordinary diversity of temperature dependences of the zero - field specific heat , which may show up to three separate local maxima .",
    "the most remarkable temperature variations of the specific heat involve a sharp low - temperature peak extended in a very narrow temperature range , which is quite reminiscent of a temperature - driven first - order phase transition . however , it has been convincingly evidenced that this anomalous peak relates to massive thermal excitations from the doubly degenerate caf phase to the macroscopically degenerate dca phase with two chiral degrees of freedom per each heisenberg spin triangle . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg three - leg tube is just the second example of the exactly solved model with such an intriguing feature in addition to a hybrid spin - electron double - tetrahedral chain @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be also mentioned that the rigorous procedure elaborated in the present work can be straightforwardly adapted to account for the non - zero external magnetic field as well .",
    "our future work will continue in this direction .",
