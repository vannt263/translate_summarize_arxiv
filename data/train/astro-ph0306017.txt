    "first argument of the pbh formation was presented by carr and hawking @xcite , in which the key concept of the pbh formation is that the three different length scales of the particle horizon , the schwarzschild radius , and the jeans length of any overdense region at radiation - dominated epoch are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "once an initially superhorizon - size density fluctuation crosses the particle horizon , competition between self gravity and centrifugal pressure force determines whether such a fluctuation collapses into black hole or not@xcite . if the self gravity overcomes the pressure force , then the fluctuation will form a black hole with the order of horizon mass .",
    "jedamzik @xcite found that , during cosmic qcd phase transition , there is almost no pressure response on adiabatic compression of fluctuation in the mixed phase of quark - gluon plasma and hadron gas .",
    "this could occur because the enhanced energy density due to the compression of the fluctuations will turn into the high energy quark - gluon phase , instead of increasing centrifugal pressure force . as a result the overdense region from initially existing fluctuations tends to collapse efficiently to form the pbh during the qcd epoch when horizon mass scale is around 1@xmath1 .",
    "pbh mass spectrum is most likely dominated by the horizon mass at the phase transition epoch @xcite .",
    "green and liddle @xcite verified that this speculation turns out to be a good approximation in their detailed studies of the pbh mass spectrum .",
    "these theoretical speculations have been studied more quantitatively in 1d general - relativistic hydrodynamic calculations @xcite , where the required critical overdensity parameter , @xmath2 , was found to be @xmath3 for the pbh formation .",
    "similar sophisticated calculations @xcite have also shown numerically that @xmath4 is even as low as @xmath5 by taking account of the dynamics of the qcd phase transition in supercooling phase by the use of eos in the mit bag model for the mixed phase .",
    "recently an interesting cosmological proposal has been made that our universe is occupied fractionally by a new class of extra - energy component in addition to the ordinary matter , known as `` quintessence '' .",
    "the quintessential scalar field causes the accelerating universal expansion at present @xcite and it also has a possibility of making significant contribution to the total energy density at radiation dominated epoch @xcite . such an extra - energy density is interpreted as to increase relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath0 , and thereby causes more rapid expansion rate at the same temperature .",
    "similar effect is expected in the neutrino - degenerate universe models @xcite , and the universal lepton asymmetry was critically studied in the context of constraining the primordial nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background anisotropies . on the other hand ,",
    "another attempt has been made quite recently to understand the einstein gravity in the light of the unified theory @xcite .",
    "five dimensional brane world cosmology leads to an effective theory of gravity , which is motivated by the superstring theory or m - theory , which is a strong candidate for the unified theory . in this scenario",
    "the `` standard '' friedmann equation should be slightly modified by adding several new terms which arise from the extra dimensions .",
    "several authors @xcite showed that there is a new class of effective energy among them which diminishes in proportion to @xmath6 called `` dark radiation '' , where @xmath7 is the cosmic scale factor .",
    "the interesting point is that this dark radiation term could be even negative because it originates purely from fifth dimensional geometry .",
    "if this is the case , negative dark radiation causes the cosmic expansion slower .",
    "we can therefore interpret this effect as a decrease in effective degrees of freedom , @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of the present letter is to study how strongly the change of the relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath0 affects the pbh formation during qcd phase transition .",
    "the energy density of the universe gets larger for larger @xmath0 at the same temperature , but the duration of qcd phase transition becomes shorter .",
    "these two effects operate in opposite direction to form pbhs . therefore",
    ", it is not a trivial subject since many physical quantities may be affected in a complicated manner by this parameter @xmath0 . in order to clarify its effects we use a simple model for the numerical analysis instead of performing complicated hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "we then try to find the parameter dependence of the typical mass scale and the amount of pbhs which are formed during the qcd phase transition .",
    "we first briefly review important quantities involved in the pbh formation during the qcd phase transition .",
    "horizon mass at the qcd epoch is written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , and t is the cosmic temperature .",
    "this equation shows that the horizon mass at the qcd phase transition is compatible to typical mass scale of machos @xcite .",
    "recent progress in lattice qcd calculations and accelerator experiments have provided with rich information of the qcd phase transition .",
    "we employ the mit bag model to express the quark - gluon plasma phase @xcite . in this model",
    "the energy densities of quark - gluon plasma ( @xmath10 ) and hadron gas ( @xmath11 ) and the pressures ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) respectively are given by @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the numbers of degrees of freedom of the quark - gluon plasma and hadron gas phases , and b is the bag constant .",
    "the condition of pressure balance between the two phases , @xmath18 , for a first order phase transition yields @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the latent heat of the phase transition .",
    "this implies that the intensity of the first order qcd phase transition depends on the difference between the two degrees of freedom before ( @xmath16 ) and after ( @xmath17 ) the phase transition .",
    "duration of the phase transition is expressed by the change of the cosmic scale factor during the phase transition . from the conservation law of entropy",
    "we estimate the rate @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the scale factors at the beginning and the end of the qcd phase transition , respectively .",
    "we can learn from this that the duration of the phase transition is comparable to the hubble time at the qcd epoch , and it is enough for fluctuations to collapse gravitationally .",
    "for the numerical analysis of the pbh formation we mainly follow the method developed by cardall and fuller @xcite .",
    "the condition for the gravitational collapse of pbh is that the self gravity is stronger than the centrifugal pressure force , which is expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is energy density , p is pressure , and @xmath27 is the size of an overdense region at the turn around .",
    "this condition becomes @xmath28 where @xmath29 in the radiation dominated era and @xmath30 is the jeans length .",
    "equation ( 8) is a well known condition for the gravitational collapse .",
    "this condition is also expressed , using the density contrast @xmath31 at horizon crossing @xcite , as @xmath32 this means that fluctuations having density contrast above @xmath33 at the horizon crossing can collapse to form pbh at radiation dominated era .",
    "we need modification of eq.(9 ) , taking account of the effects of the qcd phase transition . in order to proceed quantitative discussions",
    ", we introduce the quantity @xmath34 and modify the above condition by @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the sizes of initially expanding fluctuation at the beginning and the end of the phase transition , and @xmath39 is the size at turn around @xcite .",
    "this quantity @xmath34 works for softening the equation of state @xmath40 and takes the value , @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath34 is the minimum value , @xmath42 , the fluctuation is not affected by the qcd phase transition at all , and eq.(10 ) turns out to be the simplest case of eq.(9 ) .",
    "when @xmath34 is the maximum value , @xmath43 , the fluctuation has been affected the most by the phase transition because the fluctuation starts collapsing early enough so that the overdense region includes the mixed phase of quark - gluon plasma and hadron gas . in the latter case",
    "the system does not feel any effective pressure response . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are calculated from the energy density of the background and the energy contrast of the fluctuation when the fluctuation crosses the particle horizon .",
    "we solve the flat friedmann equation for the background @xmath44 and the closed friedmann equation for the fluctuation @xmath45 in these equations , we assume that the fluctuation has the top hat profile @xmath46 , where @xmath47 means the density contrast at horizon crossing .",
    "we normalize the density evolution and fix the gauge by setting @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 when the fluctuation crosses the horizon .",
    "we show the quantity @xmath51 as the function of @xmath47 in fig.1 , from which we can show the effect of qcd phase transition on the pbh formation . here ,",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 is the mean energy density when the fluctuation crosses the horizon , and @xmath54 is the mean energy density above which the universe is in pure quark - gluon plasma phase .",

    "@xmath57 corresponds to a fluctuation with mass scale @xmath58 @xcite .",

    "the numbers of degrees of freedom of the hadron phase and quark - gluon phase are respectively given by , @xmath67 ( pions ) , and @xmath68 ( 21 for quarks and 16 for gluons ) .",
    "we thus obtain the relation between the parameter @xmath55 and the number of effective degrees of freedom @xmath0 for horizon mass scale @xmath69 , @xmath70      we consider the significance of the pbhs formed in the qcd phase transition in this sub - section .",

    "it is to be noted that even a small fraction @xmath81 can result in the significant amount of cosmological energy density at present . from eq.(15 ) we can estimate the mass of the pbh and the variance @xmath82 for a given @xmath55 and n. we can also calculate the efficiency @xmath81 and @xmath83 using fig.1 and eqs.(15)-(19 ) .",
    "if the universe is modeled to have a new class of extra - energy component , it leads to increase relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath73 . in the neutrino - degenerate universe models",

    "we note that the dark radiation can be negative depending on the sign of @xmath87 .",

    "these indices are slightly larger than the values constrained from the evaporation of pbhs by hawking radiation in much smaller mass scale @xcite . increasing the effective number of degrees of freedom @xmath0",
    "causes the shorter duration of the qcd phase transition because the universal expansion obeys @xmath125 instead of eq.(6 ) .",
    "accordingly , the duration of the mixed phase also becomes shorter , making less efficient pbh formation ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the typical mass scale of the pbhs , however , increases with increasing @xmath0 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "this is because the fluctuations that are most effectively influenced by the qcd phase transition enter the horizon at later time with increasing number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we studied the formation mechanism of pbhs during the qcd phase transition , being motivated by the cosmological interest in machos as a dark matter and also new classes of cosmic extra - energy components for the degenerate neutrinos , dark energy , and dark radiation . in the present paper",
    "we take account of the effects of these extra - components by means of parameterizing their effect as an increase or decrease in effective relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "we conclude that the pbh formation during qcd phase transition becomes more efficient with an negative extra - component because of the increase of the duration of the qcd phase transition .",
    "we also found that in such a case the typical mass scale of pbh becomes smaller .",
