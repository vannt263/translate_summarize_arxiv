    "blazars are one type of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with relativistic jet .",
    "the small viewing angle of the jet makes it possible to observe strong effects of the special relativity , such as a boosting of the emitted power and a shortening of the characteristic time scales . although the variability in blazars has been observed at all the frequencies ( see , for example , the reviews by ulrich et al .",
    "1997 and wagner 2008 ) , the part at high energies deserves a specific interest , since most of the bolometric power of these sources is emitted at @xmath7 rays .    the shortest time scales measured by the egret experiment onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _",
    "are @xmath8 hours for pks  1622 - 29 ( mattox et al .",
    "1997 ) and @xmath9 hours for 3c  279 ( wherle et al .",
    "early results from the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( hereafter _ fermi _ ) indicated similar results : from about half - day for pks  1454 - 354 ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a ) and pks  1502 + 106 ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) to @xmath10 hours in the cases of 3c  454.3 and pks  b1510 - 089 ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2010 ) and 3c  273 ( abdo et al .",
    "2010b ) .",
    "these time scales are in agreement with the common paradigm that the characteristic spatial scale of the emitting region is of the order of the gravitational radius @xmath11 of the central spacetime singularity ( begelman et al .",
    "the zone where most of the dissipation occurs is located at distances greater than @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the bulk lorentz factor ( for most blazars @xmath14 , see ghisellini et al .",
    "the size of the emitting region is in turn linked to the variability time @xmath15 by the relationship @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the doppler factor ) .",
    "obviously , it is expected that @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the emitting region must be optically thin and sufficiently far from the central black hole to allow the @xmath7 rays to escape , otherwise they convert into electron - positron pairs .    an order - of - magnitude estimation of the above parameters results in an overall agreement with the observed variability on scales of days - hours .",
    "however , the recent detection by ground - based cerenkov telescopes ( hess and magic ) of fast variability ( minutes time scale ) at @xmath7 rays in some tev bl lac objects severely threatens the above scenario . in 2006 , during an exceptional outburst ( average flux 7 crab with peaks of more than 14 crab ) , pks 2155 - 304 displayed variability with doubling flux time scale of about @xmath6  s ( aharonian et al . 2007 ) . in 2005 , mkn 501 changed its flux within a few minutes ( albert et al .",
    "2007 ) . given the masses of these two blazars of the order of @xmath19 , the measured variability is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the minimum allowed .",
    "several solutions have been proposed , from a `` simple '' increase of the doppler factor ( @xmath20 ) to invoking an internal structure of the jet ( begelman et al .",
    "2008 , ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 , giannios et al .",
    "2009 ) .    as noted by begelman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , while these explanations could fit reasonably with bl lac subclass of blazars , the same is not appropriate for flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) subclass . indeed , this type of blazars generate @xmath7 rays by inverse compton on a population of seed photons external to the jet ( external compton , ec )",
    ". therefore , the pair photosphere can be at fairly large distances ( @xmath21 ) , which in turn means that the blob has a size so large to determine an insufficient energy density to develop strong and fast flares .",
    "it is evident that the search for sub - hour time scales in fsrq can have strong impact on the current knowledge .",
    "if measured , such very short variability would call for a strong revision of the present day models and understanding of relativistic jets .",
    "what we need is a strong outburst  like those occurred in the bl lac objects pks  2155 - 304 and mkn  501  and a highly performing instrument .    to date ,",
    "the shortest time scale observed at high energies in a fsrq is @xmath22  s , but in the hard x rays .",
    "it is the case of nrao  530 as observed by _ integral _",
    "( @xmath23  kev energy band ) during an exceptional flare in february 2004 ( foschini et al .",
    "2006 ) . despite of the good performance of _ integral",
    "_ , that episode consists of a single @xmath24 detection , while the source is below the detection limit of the instrument during the remaining of the time .",
    "no multiwavelength observations were possible at that time and , specifically , no @xmath1ray satellites were operating .",
    "therefore , this remains an isolated exceptional case and , as for every exceptional claim without a strong observational support , there is always an `` halo '' of doubts .",
    "the launch of _",
    "fermi_/lat in june 2008 could give more opportunities to search for sub - hour variability .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat , atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) could have the necessary sensitivity to probe the shortest time scales at @xmath7 rays in quasars . if we consider a flux of @xmath3  ph  @xmath4  s@xmath5 ( @xmath2  mev ) and an effective area of @xmath25  @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "14 of atwood et al .",
    "2009 , by taking into account the @xmath27  gev energy range ) , it results that for normal incidence there are about @xmath28  photons per @xmath29  minutes ( about a @xmath30 detection , by assuming that on such short time scales the background is almost absent )",
    ". however , lat operates almost always in scanning mode .",
    "this , in turn , has the great advantage to offer an efficient monitoring of all the sky ( a complete coverage every three hours or two orbits ) , but it hampers the possibility to probe time scales shorter than three hours ( the source is not always at the boresight of the instrument and , therefore , the effective area is smaller ) .",
    "a first tentative to bypass this issue has been recently made by performing a pointed observation during the giant outburst of 3c 454.3 ( @xmath0 ) occurred in early april 2010 ( wallace et al .",
    "2010 ) , when the source reached fluxes in excess of @xmath3  ph  @xmath4  s@xmath5 ( @xmath2  mev ) .",
    "such flux levels were already reached by 3c 454.3 during the first ten days of december 2009 ( see bonnoli et al . 2010 and references therein ) , but it was not possible at that time to perform a pointed observation and hence to search for sub - hours time scales .        here",
    "we report the study of the variability of the @xmath1ray emission of 3c 454.3 as observed by _",
    "fermi_/lat during the pointed observation performed from 5 to 8 april 2010 .",
    "data of _ fermi_/lat ( atwood et al . 2009 ) have been downloaded from the publicly accessible web site of heasarc and analyzed by means of the public software package ` lat science tools v. 9.15.2 ` , including the calibration files ( instrument response file , irf ` p6_v3_diffuse ` ) , the maps of the spatial diffuse background and the spectrum of the isotropic ( cosmic and instrumental ) background .",
    "we retrieved the photon list with @xmath2  mev and spacecraft data from 5 april 2010 19:38 utc to 8 april 2010 03:12 utc ( mjd @xmath31 ) corresponding to an elapsed time of about @xmath6  ks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : curva3p1 ] ) . events of class 3 ( diffuse ) inside a radius of @xmath32 centered on the coordinates of 3c 454.3 ( @xmath33 ; @xmath34 , j2000 ) and coming within @xmath35 of the zenith angle have been selected .",
    "this data set has been further filtered to exclude the events outside the good - time intervals and within @xmath36 of the earth limb .",
    "livetime and exposure maps have been calculated , as well as the diffuse background .    an unbinned likelihood algorithm ( cash 1979 , mattox et al .",
    "1996 ) , implemented in the ` gtlike ` task , has been used to extract the flux and the photon index of the source emission . a single power - law model in the form @xmath37 , where @xmath13 is the photon index ,",
    "was used to fit the energy flux distribution of the blazar .",
    "it is known that the @xmath1ray spectrum of 3c 454.3 displays a break at a few gev ( abdo et al .",
    "2009b , finke & dermer 2010 ) , but since we want to probe the shortest time scales ( hence , lower statistics ) , it is better to adopt a single power - law model .",
    "the broken power - law model has been used to fit the data of the whole observation ( see the next section ) .",
    "the backgrounds ( spatial diffuse and isotropic ) measured during this fit are kept fixed during the processing of the light curves with hours time bins or less , since we do not expect strong changes of the background in such short time scales .",
    "a first run with the optimizer ` drmnfb ` is done to grossly estimate the spectral parameters .",
    "then , the output of this process is used as input for a second run with the ` newminuit ` optimizer , to better assess the measurement errors . in the following",
    ", only statistical errors are displayed . the use of the ` p6_v3_diffuse ` response file guarantees that systematics affect the results by a value of less than 20% ( rando et al . 2009 ) . however , since this work is based only on lat data , with no comparison with other instruments at other wavelengths , there is no need of absolute flux calibration .",
    "hence , systematics are not applied .",
    "this procedure is performed iteratively for each bin time within each good - time interval in order to generate the light curve .",
    "we discarded all the detections that have no sufficiently high _ test statistic _",
    "( @xmath38 , see mattox et al .",
    "1996 for the definition ) , i.e. we considered only time bins with detection at @xmath39 . a light curve with 3 hours time bin is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : curva3p1 ] , left panel .",
    "the effective source ontime changes within the elapsed time bin , ranging from 10 to 98% in the 30-minutes bin light curve .",
    "therefore , we checked for a reasonable high @xmath38 even in presence of low source ontime .",
    "for example , the bin with the lowest source ontime ( 10% of the elapsed time bin ) has @xmath40 .",
    "we note that the average @xmath38 increased by a factor @xmath41 during the pointed observation , as expected from the increase of the instrument sensitivity when changing from scanning to pointed mode ( the light curve in scanning mode is not shown ) .",
    "the whole data set of @xmath6  ks observation has been fitted with a broken power - law model in the form of @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 otherwise .",
    "this results in these parameters : the photon indices below and above the break energy are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the break energy is @xmath47  gev and the flux integrated over the @xmath27  gev energy band is @xmath48  ph  @xmath4  s@xmath5 .",
    "the recorded counts are @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we compare these values with the early observation with _",
    "fermi _ referring to the first month of data ( abdo et al .",
    "in august 2008 , the flux was about a factor 4 smaller than in april 2010 , with a value of @xmath52  ph  @xmath4  s@xmath5 , the break energy was greater ( @xmath53  gev ) , and the photon index above the break quite softer , with a value of @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is consistent within the measurement errors .",
    "it seems that the higher flux needs of a harder spectrum .    the @xmath1ray emission of 3c 454.3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : curva3p1 ] ( left panel ) is variable on a few hours time scale .",
    "a fit with a constant - flux line gave @xmath56 ( with 18 degrees of freedom , this means a chance probability of 0.99 ) .",
    "however , we note that the last point , which is mainly driving the global variability of the light curve , is not a statistical fluctuation , but the beginning of a real flux increase .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that on 8 april there was the peak of the @xmath1ray emission of the april 2010 outburst , with a day average of @xmath57  ph  @xmath4  s@xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "no strong variability of the photon index has been measured , although some trend is visible between @xmath58 and @xmath59 april : @xmath13 changed from @xmath60 on @xmath61  april to @xmath62 ( @xmath63 significance ) on @xmath64  april .",
    "similar spectral changes have been observed in @xmath1ray blazars by egret ( nandikotkur et al .",

    "time starts on 31 march 2010 ( mjd 55286 ) , so that the number of the days corresponds also to days of april .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines in each panel correspond to the weighted average plus / minus one standard deviation . ]    the light curve with 1 hour time bin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : curva3p1 ] , right panel ) has larger error bars and hence the slight variability seen in the 3-hours - bin curve is now smoothed .",
    "the fit with a constant flux line gives @xmath65 , but the visible trends are consistent with those observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : curva3p1 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the most significant trend is the drop in flux observed between @xmath66  april .    to evaluate the time scales of these trends , we calculated the time of exponential rise or decay as defined by :    @xmath67\\ ] ]    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the fluxes at the time @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , and @xmath72 is the characteristic time scale .    in this case ,",
    "the drop on @xmath66  april visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : curva3p1 ] ( right panel ) , has @xmath73 hours ( significance of the flux variation @xmath74 ) .",
    "this value is confirmed in the 30-minutes time bin light curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : curva30min ] ( @xmath75  hrs , @xmath74 )",
    ". moreover , the rise at the end of the curve between @xmath76 has @xmath77  hrs ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "it is possible to estimate the minimum doppler factor @xmath17 ( e.g. dondi & ghisellini 1995 , mattox et al .",
    "1997 )  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 ( freedman & madore 2010 ) . ] , although during this pointed observation it was not possible to perform multiwavelength observations , because the blazar was too close to the sun .",
    "therefore , we adopted for the x - ray flux and spectrum , the values measured during the december 2009 outburst , when 3c  454.3 reached similar @xmath1ray fluxes : @xmath79 and @xmath80  @xmath81jy ( bonnoli et al .",
    "we obtain @xmath82 , for 1  gev @xmath7 rays and @xmath83  hours , a high value for a lower limit , but not unlikely ( cf ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we noted a few cases of sudden drop in the flux with @xmath84  min time scale on @xmath85 and @xmath86  april .",
    "a closer inspection of the data revealed that these bins had small source on time ( @xmath87% of the whole bin ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that it is a fake drop , caused by the not good reconstruction of the flux in presence of too few events , although sufficient for a high @xmath38 .",
    "we presented the variability analysis of the @xmath1ray observation with _ fermi_/lat of the blazar 3c 454.3 pointed during the outburst of early april 2010 .",
    "contrary to the usual scanning mode , this time _",
    "fermi _ performed a @xmath6  ks pointed observation ( wallace et al . 2010 ) , which guarantees a higher sensitivity and a longer source ontime .",
    "these particular settings , together with the exceptionally high flux emitted by the blazar , enabled us to probe the shortest time scales that we found to be in the range of @xmath88 hours , confirming the indications found by bonnoli et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and in agreement with the current theories .",
    "although the significance of the events is not very strong ( @xmath63 ) , the fact that it is present in the light curves with different time bins is an indication that the findings are well grounded . on the other side ,",
    "we have not found significant evidence of sub - hour time scales , but the present data set is not yet conclusive .",
    "we noted that the flux increased at the end of the pointed observations with @xmath89 hours .",
    "therefore , we could expect ( or reasonably hope ) that hours or less time scales may be effectively probed with _",
