    "the latter estimate is close to the timescale on which primordial gas is believed to disappear ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , if the 10 myr age estimate proves to be true , we can not exclude that this disk would contain substantial amount of primordial gas similarly to transitional disks .",
    "converting our upper limit on the co mass to total gas mass assuming a canonical h@xmath64/co abundance ratio of 10@xmath65 , the estimated gas mass in the disk of hd95086 is @xmath660.12  m@xmath54 ( @xmath663.7@xmath67  m@xmath21 ) .",

    "the characteristic dust temperatures for the inner and outer dust belts ( 190  k and 60  k ) were found to be very similar independently of the host stars luminosity , implying that the formation of dust belts is controlled by a temperature - sensitive mechanism .",

    "* ) . because the characteristic temperature of the warm component is slightly above the ice evaporation temperature , @xcite proposed that the formation of the warm component is related to sublimation of icy planetesimals crossing the snow line , or due to collisions in an asteroid belt - like system formed just interior to the snow line ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "one of these mechanisms could also work in the case of hd95086 .    to determine the relative location of the two dust belts and the planet candidate",

    "we derived a radius of 64au for the outer dust belt .",
    "since we adopted blackbody grains , this is a lower limit , because smaller grains with the same temperature can be located farther from the star .",

    "we note that the planetary system of hd95086 resembles the one around hr8799 .",
    "both systems harbor a warm inner dust belt and a broad colder outer disk and giant planet(s ) between the two dusty regions .",
    "the short lived dust grains in debris disks are believed to be replenished by collisions between larger bodies . for destructive collisions , the collision velocity must exceed a critical value and it requires a dynamical perturbing force .",
    "according to theory , this perturbation is linked to 1000  km - sized planetesimals formed within the planetesimal ring ( self - stirring , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the presence of planet(s ) in the system ( planetary stirring , * ? ? ?",
    "the formation of 1000  km - sized planetesimals is a slow process at large orbital radii . adopting an age of 17  myr for the system and using eqs .",
    "27,41 from @xcite , we found that , even in a disk with an unusually high initial surface density ( ten times higher than the minimum - mass solar nebula ) , the formation of such large bodies is limited to @xmath6670  au .",
    "our pacs images show that the disk around hd95086 is spatially extended with a diameter of 540  au .",
    "while large dust grains have the same spatial distribution as the parent planetesimals , the distribution of small grains ( smaller than the blowout limit of @xmath31.8 , estimated following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be more extended , because they are expelled by stellar radiation pressure and form a dust halo .",
    "however , the contribution of such small grains to the 100 and 160 flux is small , suggesting that hd95086 harbors an extended planetesimal belt whose dynamical stirring can not be explained by self - stirring .",
    "@xcite claim that planetary stirring can be faster than self - stirring in the outer regions of planetary systems . using their formulae",
    ", we found that the candidate planet can dynamically excite the motion of planetesimals even at 270  au via their secular perturbation if its orbital eccentricity is larger than @xmath700.4 .",

    "<S> recently , a new planet candidate was discovered on direct images around the young ( 10 - 17 myr ) a - type star hd95086 . </S>",
    "<S> the strong infrared excess of the system indicates that , similarly to hr8799 , @xmath0  pic , and fomalhaut , the star harbors a circumstellar disk . aiming to study the structure and gas content of the hd95086 disk , and to investigate its possible interaction with the newly discovered planet , here we present new optical , infrared and millimeter observations . </S>",
    "<S> we detected no co emission , excluding the possibility of an evolved gaseous primordial disk . </S>",
    "<S> simple blackbody modeling of the spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of two spatially separate dust belts at radial distances of 6 and 64  au . </S>",
    "<S> our resolved images obtained with the _ herschel space observatory _ reveal a characteristic disk size of @xmath1 ( 540@xmath2490au ) and disk inclination of @xmath325@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the same inclination for the planet candidate s orbit , its re - projected radial distance from the star is 62  au , very close to the blackbody radius of the outer cold dust ring . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the planetary system at hd95086 resembles the one around hr8799 . </S>",
    "<S> both systems harbor a warm inner dust belt and a broad colder outer disk and giant planet(s ) between the two dusty regions . </S>",
    "<S> modelling implies that the candidate planet can dynamically excite the motion of planetesimals even out to 270  au via their secular perturbation if its orbital eccentricity is larger than about 0.4 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis adds a new example to the three known systems where directly imaged planet(s ) and debris disks co - exist . </S>"
