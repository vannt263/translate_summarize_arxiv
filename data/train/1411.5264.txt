    "a most general description of a planet is that it is a self - gravitating object composed of a heavy element core and an envelope of gas .",
    "terrestrial like planets are dominated by solid cores whereas giant gas planets are mainly hydrogen gas .",
    "given these observational facts , it should come as no surprise that there are two competing scenarios for planet formation that take opposite views on what comes first ( for a recent review see * ? ? ? * ) . in the top - down scenario hydrogen gas cloud",

    "@xcite proposed that these cores could be all that is left of the original gas protoplanets if the dominant gas component is disrupted by tidal forces from the sun ( this process was rediscovered by * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite instead posited that microscopic dust grains in the protoplanetary disc grow larger and then somehow collect into huge rocks of at least @xmath3 1 km size , called planetesimals .",
    "these coalesce into even larger solid cores .",
    "low mass cores become terrestrial planets .",
    "largest cores , of mass @xmath4 ( 10 earth masses ) , attract gaseous atmospheres from the protoplanetary disc and end up as giant gas planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this bottom - up scenario is now called core accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is by far the most popular planet formation theory .",
    "differentiation between these two theories was thought to be straight forward based on the solar system data .",
    "gi unstable discs were argued not to produce self - gravitating clumps at all at the location of the solar system planets due to an inefficient disc cooling @xcite , so the sequence of events envisioned by the top - down picture could not be even started .",
    "ca picture , on the other hand , proved quite successful in explaining the solar system @xcite .",
    "however , the above criticism of the top - down scenario neglects the possibility of planet migration ( that is , shrinking of the planet s orbit due to gravitational torques from the protoplanetary disc , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ca planets were equipped with migration since @xcite , who showed convincingly that hot jupiters could not have formed at their observed planet - star separations , @xmath5  au , and are more likely to have migrated from their assumed birth location of @xmath6  au .",
    "in contrast , the role of migration for gi planet formation model was not appreciated until @xcite .",
    "these authors pointed out that gravitationally unstable discs do not actually need to form gas clumps at @xmath3 a few au to explain the observed planets there : in simulations , most gi fragments are found to migrate rapidly from their birth locations at @xmath7  au into the inner disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is hence plausible that all of the observed giant planets were hatched by gi in the outer disc and were then pulled much closer to the host star by the gravitational disc torques .",
    "furthermore , some of the fragments could give birth to earth - mass or more massive cores by grain growth and sedimentation , and be tidally disrupted , potentially providing a `` new '' pathway  au to arbitrarily close to the star .",
    "] to forming all kinds of planets at all separations in a single framework that was called `` tidal downsizing '' ( td ) .",
    "we note in passing that @xcite recently presented the results of the palms survey which shows that the frequency of giant gas planets at large separations ( @xmath8  au ) is very low , e.g. , less than @xmath9% , implying that the `` poster child '' gi - planet system hr 8799 @xcite is very rare .",
    "@xcite conclude that `` disc instability is not a common mode of giant planet formation '' . in the context of td hypothesis , the observations of @xcite , unfortunately",
    ", do not tell us directly about disc fragmentation properties at these separations ; they rather show that gi - planets rarely survive at their initial large separations to the present day .",
    "in fact , given that the inward migration times of gi planets are as short as @xmath10 million years @xcite , it has been argued that it is not clear how any of the observed gi planets ( such as the multi - planetary system hr 8799 ) survive .",
    "for example , @xcite found that all of their 13 simulated gas clumps were either tidally destroyed , migrated into the inner few au , or became brown dwarfs due to gas accretion .",
    "observations of @xcite are therefore in excellent agreement with expectations of td . any gi model that does not include migration of planets",

    "the potential of the top - down scenario remains poorly explored to this day , mainly because understanding of different aspects of the model is not yet complete , and connecting them together in order to make solid observational predictions is not trivial . the first population synthesis model for td hypothesis was presented by @xcite , who used a semi - analytical approach to disc evolution and an analytical description for fragment contraction , grain growth and the resultant core formation .",
    "the results of their study are not particularly encouraging for td .",
    "many fragments were found to run away in mass by accreting gas and became brown dwarfs at large separations from the parent star .",
    "others were disrupted by tides before they could assemble a massive core .",
    "while solid cores with masses up to @xmath11 were assembled inside the fragments by grain sedimentation , most of them were locked inside brown dwarf mass fragments . out of a million gas fragments simulated , only one yielded an earth mass core _ without _ an overlaying massive gas envelope .",
    "more recently , population synthesis was also performed by @xcite , who used different prescriptions for fragment cooling and did not address core formation .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , the latter study found that most of the gas fragments yield hot jupiters rather than brown dwarfs at large separations .",
    "this large difference in the results of the two studies motivates the present paper , which improves on both by using 1d numerical rather than analytical descriptions of the coupled disc and planet evolution .",
    "the eventual goal is to have a physically constrained and therefore predictive model of the td hypothesis , put in a computationally expedient framework , and enabling statistical comparisons to the observed planetary data .    while a detailed comparison to the data is to be reported in follow up publications , as a way of illustrating the methods and the information obtained at the end of the runs , the question of gi fragments surviving the initial rapid inward migration from their birth place into the inner disc regions is considered .",
    "more specifically , the focus is on how and when the fragments can contract and collapse more rapidly than they migrate in .",
    "this topic has direct observational connections .",
    "giant planets are observed to be much more frequent around metal - rich stars than around metal - poor ones @xcite .",
    "this correlation has been argued to provide a direct support to ca theory since metal - rich environments assemble massive cores much more readily ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the same time ,",
    "gravitational instability planets ( and thus td planets also ) are expected to survive the inward migration phase most readily in metal - poor environments because their radiative cooling is the fastest at low dust opacities @xcite .",
    "this therefore appears to contradict the observed planet - metallicity correlation and is a very clear challenge to the td hypothesis .",
    "accretion of `` pebbles '' , @xmath12  cm sized grains , from the surrounding protoplanetary disc onto solid bodies , e.g. , large planetesimals up to massive cores , has been studied by a number of authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite argued that while pre - collapse giant planets may be inefficient gas accretors ( see  [ sec : broader ] further on this ) , they nevertheless should accrete pebbles for same reasons as solid cores in the ca picture do , except at higher rates because td fragments have much higher ( @xmath13 jupiter ) masses . adding a pebble injection term to the equations of an otherwise isolated td fragment evolution ,",
    "a surprising result was obtained : the fragments actually accelerated their contraction and collapsed sooner , not later , despite the increase in the dust opacity associated with the higher metallicity of the fragments .",
    "@xcite explained the effect in terms of the extra weight and ( negative , of course ) potential energy that pebbles bring with them into the gas fragments .",
    "pre - collapse fragments turn out to be very sensitive to pebble accretion because they are nearly polytropes with low effective adiabatic indexes , @xmath14 .",
    "it was found that addition of @xmath9% by mass in grains is sufficient to drive a typical pre - collapse molecular h fragment into collapse .",
    "even more recently , @xcite presented a population synthesis like study that included the `` metal overload '' collapse due to pebble accretion on td planets for the first time , and found a strong positive rather than negative correlation of giant planet survival with disc metallicity .",
    "his model did not include the processes of grain growth , sedimentation and core formation inside the fragment .",
    "this paper expands the work of @xcite by adding core growth processes .",
    "further , two ways of enhancing the survived giant planet fraction are considered : pebble accretion and lower dust opacity due to grain growth ( this was not considered in * ? ? ? * at all ) .",
    "it is argued that low opacity models require unrealistically small dust opacities ( @xmath1 orders of magnitude smaller than the interstellar grain opacity at same metallicity ) to save the gas fragments from disruptions .",
    "even if this were plausible , low opacity models suffer from a host of other issues : ( i ) predict a negative correlation of planet frequency with host metallicity , ( ii ) can not produce solid cores more massive than @xmath15 , ( iii ) fail to explain why the observed giant planets are strongly over - abundant in metals .",
    "it is thus clear that low opacity models are a dead end as far as an all inclusive td model for planet formation is concerned .",
    "pebble accretion models , on the other hand , offer a more attractive alternative .",
    "they do not require unrealistically small opacities , naturally explain why giant planets can be much more metal rich than their host stars , and produce a positive giant planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "even the `` discarded '' gas fragments , e.g. , those destroyed by tides or thermal over - heating are important since the masses of solid cores surviving such disruptions can be in the terrestrial and above mass range .",
    "the paper is structured as following .",
    "a brief introduction into the physical motivation behind the td hypothesis , and a short overview of the literature on td , including potential applications to observations of the solar system and beyond , is given in  2 below .",
    "numerical algorithms for simulating the planet - disc interaction and the disc evolution are introduced and some example ( point mass planet ) migration tracks are calculated in  [ sec : disc ] . ",
    "[ sec : planet ] deals with the methods used to calculate the fragment evolution , including pebble accretion , grain growth , settling and core formation , whereas  [ sec : together ] explains how the two modules are put in one code and what the initial conditions are .   [ sec : opacity ] and [ sec : pebbles ] show examples of fragment evolution tracks for low opacity and pebble accretion models , respectively . in  [ sec : discussion ] , the implications of the results obtained for td hypothesis is given .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the evolution of an isolated jupiter mass planet contracting from an initial state in which its central temperature is 100 k. the planet s metallicity is set to solar , and opacity is set to that of the interstellar gas / dust mix @xcite .",
    "the calculation is done with the part of the code described in section [ sec : planet ] , although grain growth and grain sedimentation within the planet are neglected .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig:1 ] shows the evolution of planet s radius , @xmath16 , in units of jupiter s radius , @xmath17 , whereas the bottom panel shows the planet s central temperature .",
    "the planet s evolution is conveniently described in two stages @xcite . in the first `` pre - collapse '' stage",
    ", the planet s central temperature is below @xmath18  k , and hydrogen is in the molecular form . as temperature exceeds @xmath18  k , h@xmath19 molecules begin to dissociate .",
    "the process of breaking the molecules up requires 4.5 ev per hydrogen molecule , which is very large : it is equivalent to the thermal kinetic energy of two h atoms at temperature @xmath20 k. the dissociation process is therefore a huge energy sink , and leads to the planet loosing its hydrostatic equilibrium and collapsing dynamically . the new , post - collapse , equilibrium is such that h is atomic and partially ionised , central planet s temperature is well above @xmath21  k , and the planet radius is more than ten times smaller than in the pre - collapse state . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the dynamical collapse corresponds to the nearly vertical part of the radius and temperature evolution curves . after the collapse ,",
    "the planet arrives on the post - collapse stage , which is one and the same as the `` hottest start '' track for giant gas planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , this post - collapse part of the evolution begins at the blue `` o '' symbol in the top panel of the figure . during this phase , the planet contracts from @xmath22 to @xmath23 relatively rapidly , e.g. , in some @xmath24  years , and then takes much longer to eventually contract to @xmath25 .",
    "the key point to observe from the top panel of figure [ fig:1 ] is just how extended the planet is at birth ( @xmath26 1 au , or about @xmath27 ) , and that it takes over a million years for the planet to contract to radii comparable to that of jupiter .",
    "the red solid horizontal lines show the hill s radius , @xmath28 , of the planet at three distances from a @xmath29 host star .",
    "when @xmath16 is larger may be sufficient for disruption , see  [ sec : tides ] below ] when @xmath28 , tidal forces from the star exceed self - gravity of the planet , and it can be disrupted , as in the original @xcite scenario .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] thus shows that the planet can be tidally disrupted at the planet - star separations @xmath30",
    "au in the pre - collapse stage .",
    "in addition , the planet can be tidally disrupted in the post - collapse stage in the innermost `` hot '' region of the disc , @xmath31  au , provided the collapse happened very recently ( no more than @xmath32  years earlier ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that such hot disruptions may be the origin of `` hot '' sub - giant planets such as hot super - earths or hot neptunes .",
    "another point worth noting from figure [ fig:1 ] is that the astrophysical metal components of the protoplanet ( that is , all elements heavier than h and he ) can settle into the centre of it provided that condensation temperature of the components is higher than the central temperature of the planet . in this paper",
    "we limit our attention to three dominant grain species : water ice , organics called chon , and a mix of fe and silicates ( cf . ",
    "[ sec : gr_growth ] below ) .",
    "the condensation temperatures for these species are marked approximately by the position of the respective text in the bottom panel of figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "note that the planet spends little time in the cold configuration , since it cools relatively rapidly initially . from this one",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the gaseous component of the protoplanet is then disrupted by the tides , the nearly `` naked '' core survives , since its density is much higher .",
    "such disruptions may be an alternative to ca origin for terrestrial - like planets @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the fate of a gas fragment formed in the outer disc by gi is sealed @xcite by the ratios of the various time scales : @xmath33 , the planet s contraction and collapse time scale ; @xmath34 , the planet s migration time scale ; and @xmath35 , the grain growth and sedimentation time scale .",
    "qualitatively , there are several possibilities :    1 .",
    "if the migration time is the shortest of the three , the fragment is disrupted with essentially nothing remaining of it ; 2 .   if @xmath36 , then grains sediment down before the planet is disrupted .",
    "there is therefore a remnant , a solid core @xcite , possibly surrounded by a post - disruption atmosphere remaining bound to the core if the latter is massive enough ; 3 .",
    "if @xmath37 , then the planet collapses before it is disrupted , and survives as as a gas giant planet , provided it is not disrupted in the `` hot '' region or pushed all the way into the star .",
    "4 .   if grain sedimentation time is the shortest of the three , and the core mass is significant , @xmath38  a few to ten or more earth masses , then the grain component can affect the whole fragment by either triggering its collapse @xcite or destruction @xcite .",
    "clearly , it is essential to be able to calculate not only these three time scales but also the detailed planetary structure as well as the protoplanetary disc evolution .",
    "the planet formation / destruction road map outlined above is only a very rough guess as to what may actually happen in a realistic disc and planet setting .",
    "@xcite found formation and a rapid inward migration of massive self - gravitating gas clumps in their 2d simulations of protostellar discs .",

    "@xcite were first to point out that gas clump migration , core formation and then envelope disruption may result in formation of terrestrial - like planets .",
    "@xcite noted that dynamics of solids can be important enough to change the fragmentation properties of the gravitationally unstable discs , and to affect the gas clump compositions .",
    "these in general do not therefore have to be same as that of their parent discs @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the high - temperature environment inside the clumps ( before they are disrupted ) may provide a natural nursery for high temperature inclusions found in chondrules of the solar system .",
    "@xcite proposed that prograde rotation of the pre - collapse gas fragments may have been imprinted on the spin directions of earth and mars , and yield enough angular momentum for proto - earth to revive the fission hypothesis for the moon formation .",
    "@xcite observed recurrent episodes of clump formation , destruction and protostellar outflow injections in 3d simulations of self - gravitating discs .",
    "@xcite made detailed studies of planet migration in gravitationally unstable discs , finding migration times of order @xmath9 thousand years .",
    "@xcite simulated in 3d a gravitationally unstable gas disc together with the grains that were allowed to grow , and found that grains grew most rapidly inside the clumps and indeed sedimented into the dense cores .",
    "@xcite made first 3d simulations of collapse of the rotating molecular clumps , noting the importance of the angular momentum and formation of the post collapse circum - planetary discs .",
    "it is important to note that planetesimals are not a pre - requisite for td model , unlike for ca . in the context of td , minor solids , such as asteroids ,",
    "are remnants of larger solid bodies that were fragmented in collisions .",
    "thus , @xcite argued that kuiper and asteroid belts in the solar system could be made in disruptions of molecular gas fragments in which some of the solids sedimented into the centre and got locked into a number of ceres mass bodies .",
    "they found that after the gas clump disruption , the distribution of solid bodies naturally forms rings with sharp edges , as observed in the solar system , and that this model does not have the `` mass budget deficit '' , resolving the two well known problem of the classical models of the kuiper belt ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite argued that gas accretion on relatively low mass gas td fragments ( @xmath39  a few @xmath40 ) is inefficient due to preheating effects from the planet on surrounding gas .",
    "these authors found that there is a dichotomy in the fate of the clumps .",
    "low mass clumps were found to migrate in rapidly at more or less constant mass , and eventually were destroyed by the host star s tides .",
    "clumps more massive than @xmath41 were found to run away in the `` opposite '' sense : accreting gas rapidly , they become as massive as @xmath42 , open deep gaps in their protoplanetary discs , and stall at about the initial star - clump separation .",
    "this divergent evolution may explain the divergent results on the fate of the gas clumps in the literature ( giant planets or brown dwarfs ",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* for references ) , since small changes to the disc parameters and the treatment of gas thermodynamics may shift the clumps from one of the other regime .",
    "@xcite presented 3d radiative hydrodynamics simulations of massive self - gravitating discs .",
    "their approach is clearly preferable to all of the previous 2d studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also the earlier 3d studies which used radiative cooling prescriptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite find that most of their clumps are as massive as @xmath43 at birth and grow rapidly in mass while migrating in .",
    "what is not clear is how general these results are with respect to changes in initial conditions , and how they depend on the dust opacity model assumed by @xcite .    here , and everywhere in the paper , only the simplest version of events is considered , in which the planets start out as self - gravitating gas fragments and do _ not accrete _ gas or planetesimals from the disc . both gas accretion and especially planetesimals",
    "are virtues of the core accretion model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it appears to be most prudent to first consider the simplest `` orthodox '' td hypothesis .",
    "more complicated versions of td may be considered in the future .",

    "@xcite were interested not only in the fate of the planets but also in the potential connection between giant planet disruptions and the fu ori outbursts of young stars @xcite .",

    "the approach here follows that of @xcite with a few changes . since the fate of less massive gas planets and also that of even less massive remnants ( solid cores , if the planets are disrupted ) is of interest to us here , type i migration regime ( no gap in the disc ) is also included .",
    "accretion luminosities of young stars , although calculated here automatically by the viscous disc evolution code , are of no direct interest .",
    "therefore , the treatment of the planet s mass loss is simplified from that of @xcite : it is assumed that the planet is disrupted instantaneously if the disruption criteria are satisfied , and the mass deposition back in the disc is neglected for simplicity .",

    "as far as we are aware , there is no corresponding expression for @xmath67 , perhaps partly because one usually studies type i migration in the limit where the planet s mass is small compared to the disc mass , so that the back reaction of the planet on the disc can be neglected .",
    "our planets can be massive and yet still be in type i regime , especially in the outer self - gravitating disc @xcite , and also in the inner disc if viscosity parameter @xmath68 is `` large '' ( e.g. , greater than @xmath3 0.01 - 0.03 ) . furthermore , gas giant planets studied here are bright and can easily dominate the disc luminosity around their location , e.g , within the region @xmath69 $ ] ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this may affect the thermodynamic disc structure near the location of the planet , yet none of the migration disc studies in the literature currently take this effect into account .",

    "the first disc is much cooler , so that @xmath96 is smaller . due to this , and since the viscosity parameter is low , the disc already develops a deep gap when the planet migrates to @xmath98  au .",
    "the gap remains deep but partially opened until the planet migrates to @xmath99  au , at which point the inner disc viscous time is shorter than the planet s migration time , so that the inner disc drains onto the star and there is a complete gap between the star and the planet .",
    "the planet continues to be `` pushed '' inward by the angular momentum exchange with the outer disc , and eventually perishes by going through the inner boundary of our computational domain for these tests , @xmath100 au .",
    "in contrast , the planet is unable to open a gap of any denomination in the second test because the disc is much hotter , so @xmath96 is higher , and because the disc viscosity is high . this planet is always embedded in its parent disc and migrates in type i regime only .",
    "the high disc viscosity in the second disc implies that this disc evolves much faster .",
    "this can be surmised from the @xmath45 curves in figure [ fig : two_discs ] : there is a notable decrease in the disc surface density curves st late times even at large @xmath48 in the middle right hand panel , whereas the corresponding curves on the left show that the disc evolves only inside @xmath101  au region for the low viscosity test .",

    ", there is however a profound difference .",
    "while the hot disc planet ( solid curve ) continues to migrate in the type i regime , initially quickly and then slower and slower as it nears the inner disc , the other planet opens a deep gap and starts to migrate in type ii regime , as we already saw in figure [ fig : two_discs ] .",
    "contrary to the hot disc case , the planet in the low mass disc test accelerates as it enters the inner disc region .",
    "therefore , somewhat contrary to intuition , the less massive and cooler disc pushes the planet through the inner boundary much faster ( the hotter disc case planet arrives at the inner boundary  not shown in the figure  about a million years later ) .",
    "focusing now on the irradiation temperature evolution , two significant factors should be noted .",
    "first of all , the planet in the hotter disc is bound to find itself in hotter environment , generally .",

    "temperature @xmath95 .",
    "the planet in the colder disc is in the gap , and that region is much cooler : the appropriate irradiation temperature is comparable to the disc effective temperature .",
    "there is a factor of at least a few difference in these two temperatures _ at the same radius @xmath48 _ because the disc optical depth is usually considerable and hence the midplane temperature is higher than the effective one ( @xmath105 in the shakura and sunyaev 1973 disc theory , where @xmath106 is the disc optical depth ) . in terms of irradiating flux incident on the planet",

    "this is the `` thermal bath '' effect by which gaseous protoplanets are known to be destroyed when the surrounding environment is too hot @xcite .",

    "it should be noted that if the thermal bath destruction did not occur , this particular planet would have been destroyed very soon nevertheless by tidal disruption since the tidal disruption criterion ( equation [ disruption1 ] ) is almost satisfied at @xmath275  years .",

    "the remnant of the disruption is a low mass solid core , @xmath277 .",
    "it is composed almost equally of chon and silicates .",
    "the presence of chon materials in the core is explained by the arrested evolution of the planet : since it is unable to cool and contract , it stays relatively cold for longer , and this enables chon grains to sediment down into the core .",
    "water ice can not condense out even in these conditions , which is consistent with earlier results of @xcite who found that td cores contain little water .",
    "the remnant core is very low mass , so that it does not migrate appreciably during the simulation , stalling at @xmath278  au .",
    "the simulations m1lowopx were all stopped at @xmath279 million years , but the remnant s migration time is @xmath280 years at the end of the run , so not much migration would occur in the typical 3 million years disc lifetime even if the simulations were continued for longer .",
    "figure [ fig : m1_op0.01 ] shows an identical run but with opacity further reduced , @xmath281 , labelled m1lowop7 in table 1 . in this case , the planet s intrinsic luminosity exceeds the irradiating one at early times ( cf . the dash - dot blue and the dotted red curves in panel b ) .",
    "the planet thus contracts rapidly , and its central temperature increases rapidly ( the solid black curve in panel b ) .",
    "the planet undergoes the second collapse at @xmath282 years , well before it is challenged thermally ( due to external irradiation ) or tidally ( due to tidal forces from the star ) .",

    "the conclusion from this series of tests is that opacity reduction by a factor of @xmath284 , compared to the interstellar grain opacity at solar metallicity , is needed to counter the short inward migration times and the thermal bath effect , at least for the parameters of the disc and the planet mass chosen in this section .",
    "figure [ fig : mcores ] shows the mass of the cores formed in the series of runs m1lowopx as a function of the opacity reduction factor @xmath285 , and section [ sec : discussion ] considers broader implications of these runs for td theory of planet formation .",
    "finally for this section , figure [ fig : m5_op0.1 ] shows simulation m5lowop2 , where the fragment is more massive , @xmath286 .",
    "the practical interest in considering more massive fragments is that such fragments cool much more rapidly than @xmath3 jupiter mass ones ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , one may reason that dust opacity may not need to be reduced by orders of magnitude for such fragments .    indeed , in simulation m5lowop2",
    "( see table 1 ) , @xmath287 , that is , the dust opacity is reduced by only a factor of 2 , yet the planet is able to contract and collapse before being tidally disrupted .",
    "the collapse occurs at @xmath288 years , when the planet is at separation @xmath289  au .",
    "one reason for the fast contraction of the planet is that the planet s effective isolated temperature , @xmath269 , is always above the irradiation temperature ( cf .",
    "panel b ) , and the second is that the planet s migration is dramatically slowed down when the planet opens a gap in the disc at @xmath290  au .",
    "however , the planet eventually migrates all the way to the inner boundary condition at @xmath291  au after about 0.5 million years ( see the inset in panel a of the figure ) .",
    "it would become either a hot jupiter , if its migration stalls in the regions closer to the star that are not simulated here , or be swallowed by the star completely .",
    "note also that despite having 5 times more mass in metals than the @xmath263 runs , the fragment only manages to assemble a tiny silicate core , @xmath292 ( cf .",
    "panel c of the figure and the table ) .",
    "this is because the fragment spends too little time in the molecular h regime ( the pre - collapse stage ) , so that even the silicate grains have too short a time window in which to grow and sediment .",
    "this finding is consistent with results of @xcite who found that the higher the mass of the fragment , the less efficient is core formation .    to save space , the simulation m5lowop1",
    "is not shown in figures but its results are listed in table 1 . in this higher opacity , @xmath293 case , the planet does not manage to contract into the giant planet and is disrupted at @xmath294  au .",
    "the core formed in this simulation is only slightly more massive , @xmath295 .    from the m5lowopx series of runs we learn that ( i ) the planet must be more massive than about @xmath296 to contract faster than migrate in at solar metallicity , at least for the disc parameters chosen in this series of runs , and that ( ii ) massive planets do not make much more massive cores than less massive planets do .",
    "this last finding is not new at all @xcite .",
    "in this section , models with pebble accretion onto the gas fragments and with interstellar dust opacity , scaled to the instantaneous metallicity of the fragment , are considered .",
    "the initial conditions for the disc and the planet are exactly the same as for the runs m1lowopx , but here the opacity reduction factor is @xmath293 . additionally , since the metallicity of the fragments now varies with time as pebbles accrete onto the fragments , the opacity coefficient is chosen to be proportional to the fragment s metallicity : @xmath297 , where @xmath298 is the interpolated table dust and gas opacity at solar metallicity from @xcite .",
    "pebble accretion rate is calculated as described in  [ sec : dot_mz ] .",
    "table 1 lists input parameters and key results from several runs of this series , which are labelled m1pebx , where x is an integer between 1 and 9 which sets the pebble mass fraction in the disc , @xmath299 . presumably , higher metallicity discs would have higher @xmath300 as grain growth is faster at higher metallicities , so high ( low ) values of @xmath285 may be taken as a proxy for high ( low ) values of disc metallicity .",
    "figure [ fig : m1_terr1 ] shows the results of the run m1peb4 , @xmath301 in the format similar to figure [ fig : m1_op0.01 ] to [ fig : m5_op0.1 ] , except that the bottom panel ( c ) also shows the evolution of the planet s metallicity , @xmath107 , defined as the ratio of the mass of the metals to the total mass of the planet .",

    "due to pebble accretion , the planet s metallicity increases with time sharply until time @xmath268  years . at that point accretion of pebbles",
    "slows down since the planet starts opening a gap in the disc around its location , so that @xmath231 plummets . as a result , the planet contraction slows down ( note that the dashed blue curve in panel ( a ) flattens at that point ) . due to a continuing inward migration",
    ", the hills radius of the planet ( red dotted curve in panel a ) continues to shrink , and the planet is tidally disrupted at time @xmath302  years , when the tidal disruption criterion ( equation [ disruption1 ] ) is met .",
    "the core s mass at that point is @xmath303 and the planet s location is @xmath304  au .",
    "since the core s possible atmosphere is neglected in this paper , the mass of the planet after the disruption is set to that of the core , and the metallicity is set to @xmath305 by definition . also , the temperature of the planet is arbitrarily set to 0 to make the cases of envelope disruption visibly distinct from the cases when the envelope collapses and heats up ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : m5_op0.1 ] ) . in reality",
    "the core s temperature may be quite high but that is not modelled here (  [ sec : core ] ) .",
    "the core s composition in run m1peb4 is dominated by silicates ( see panel c of fig . [",
    "fig : m1_terr1 ] ) , yet over a third of the core s mass comes from organics ( chon ) .    next figure , [ fig : m1_hjup1 ] , shows simulation m1peb3 , which has a slightly higher fraction of pebbles in the disc , @xmath306 .",
    "this turns out to be sufficiently high to enforce collapse of the fragment before it is tidally or thermally disrupted .",
    "metallicity of this planet at collapse is @xmath307 .",
    "this higher metallicity translates into larger grain sizes in the planet ( since @xmath308 term in equation [ dadt_full ] is larger ) and a higher grain growth rate of the core .",
    "the mass of the core at collapse is @xmath309 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the chon mass of the core is actually slightly lower than in the run m1peb4 , and hence the core is over 90% silicates .",
    "this result is driven by a faster contraction rate of the planet in m1peb3 .",
    "the time window for chon grains settling into the core is now shorter , so despite more chon mass inside the planet , a smaller mass of that reservoir arrives at and is locked into the core .",
    "the planet in simulation m1peb3 continues to migrate in a regime intermediate between type i and ii regimes and eventually arrives at the disc s inner edge .",
    "the planet may survive as a hot jupiter if the disc is removed while the planet is still migrating in or if the inner boundary of the disc is cut off by magnetospheric interactions sufficiently far from the star s surface .",
    "finally , table 1 lists the results of the most pebble - rich run of the series , m1peb1 , @xmath310 .",
    "interestingly , the higher abundance of pebbles did not increase the core s mass or the planet s metallicity at collapse .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that the planet collapses when it accretes enough pebbles @xcite , which is independent of the rate at which the metals are added to the planet .",
    "the core s mass appears to be lower due to a shorter time span available for grain sedimentation .    in summary , runs m1pebx with x=1,2,3 produced a giant planet that collapses before it was tidally disrupted , whereas runs with x@xmath311 resulted in tidal or thermal disruptions of the giant planets - to - be .",
    "since a higher pebble accretion rate may be expected at higher metallicity environments , one expects a positive correlation of the giant planet detection frequency with metallicity of the host , as shown by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : structure ] shows the planet s internal variables as a function of the total ( gas plus metals ) mass enclosed in concentric shells for a planet from run m1peb3 at time @xmath312 years , before it is tidally disrupted . the planet s structure in the pre - collapse ( or pre - disruption ) stages are similar to one another , so fig . [ fig : structure ] is representative of the pre - collapse td planets structure in general .",
    "the temperature in the planet , as expected , is maximum in the centre and falls off towards the planet s outer edge ; see the solid curve in panel ( a ) . in the same panel , the dotted red curve shows radius in units of au as a function of the enclosed mass .",
    "the planet s outer radius is @xmath313  au .",
    "the blue dashed curve shows the local metallicity , @xmath314 , defined as the ratio of the metal s mass in the given mass shell to the total mass of that shell .",
    "note that the highest metallicity gas is at the centre of the planet , as may be expected if metals ( grains ) are able to sediment to the planet s centre .",
    "in addition , there are two somewhat sharp features in the @xmath314 function , one at @xmath315 , and the other near the outer edge of the planet .",
    "these two features mark two important transitions within the planet .",
    "the nature of these transitions is best inferred from the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] , ( c ) , which shows the grain size for the three grain species that are considered in this paper : water , chon and silicates .",
    "the vaporisation temperatures for these species are very different ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the silicate grains are the most refractory of the three , so they are able to sediment down all the way to the centre of the cloud in fig . [",
    "fig : structure ] . despite this , note that the grain size for silicates is limited to a few cm .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the grain breaking velocity set to @xmath316  cm / s for this simulations .",
    "larger grains would sediment faster than this and would fragment due to collisions . in the outer regions of the planet ,",
    "the grains are not limited by fragmenting collisions .",
    "instead , the limitation here comes from the balance between the rate at which the grains grow and the rate at which they sediment down : larger grains are constantly removed from the outer regions of the planet by sedimentation , so there exist a quasi equilibrium between small growth injection at the outer edge of the cloud , grain growth and sedimentation of the grains",
    ".    grain diffusion due to convection in particular is a very important part of this quasi - equilibrium , since convection opposes grain sedimentation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "effects of convective grain mixing are best revealed by looking at the grain volume density distributions ( the middle panel , b ) .",
    "it is notable that there are transitions in @xmath317 , where @xmath318 is the grain volume density of species @xmath252 , at locations where grain size @xmath319 changes abruptly .",
    "for example , chon grains are `` small '' in the outer region of the cloud , then `` large '' between @xmath320 and @xmath321 , and very small again for @xmath322 .",
    "just as with silicate grains , this is because grain growth is sedimentation - limited in the outer region , then fragmentation - limited in the middle , and finally grain vaporisation dissolves the grains and puts them into the gas phase .",
    "convection controls chon grains volume distribution in the inner part of the cloud , where @xmath323 const to a good degree . in the fragmentation - limited range",
    ", @xmath324 is strongly decreasing outward , until the grains are small and convection again takes over .",
    "water ice grains are able to settle down only through the outermost @xmath325 of the planet , and therefore there is a very large gradient in the water ice concentration there . in the rest of the planet water",
    "is very well mixed with the h / he phase .",
    "these grain growth , fragmentation and convective mixing equilibria drive the chemical abundances of the species with the planet . in the outer @xmath326 of the planet , water is more abundant than chon and silicates by a factor of @xmath327 rather than the expected ( solar ) abundance ratio ( two ) . on the other hand , silicates are over - abundant over water and chon compared to their initial relative abundances by a factor of @xmath9 in the centre of the planet .",
    "td fragments are hence natural thermo - mechanical element differentiation `` factories '' while they are in the molecular h ( pre - collapse ) phase ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more on this point ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mcores ] presents a bird s view of the results of the three series of runs presented in table 1 by showing only the dependence of the core mass , @xmath209 , on the pebble mass fraction , @xmath230 , for the pebble accretion runs m1pebx ( triangles ) , and on the opacity reduction factor , @xmath285 , for the `` low opacity '' runs m1lowopx or m5lowopx ( diamonds and squares , respectively ) .",
    "in addition , the runs that resulted in the collapse of the giant planet rather than its disruption are connected with one another by solid segments of the same colour as the symbols .",
    "for example , the three black triangles in the upper right of fig .",

    "it could be argued that planet migration inside lower mass discs than @xmath328 used universally for all the tests in table 1 could allow for a smaller reduction in opacity ( that is , higher @xmath285 ) , but much lower mass discs are unlikely to become self - gravitating and give birth to a gi fragment in the first place .",
    "furthermore , observed giant planets in the solar system and beyond ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are known to be over - abundant in metals by a factor of @xmath9 or more than @xmath329 .",
    "thus the needed opacity reduction is a factor of @xmath222 for the observed metal - rich giant planets of about one jupiter mass .",
    "while grain growth can reduce opacity @xcite , grain fragmentation should be included in such models as well @xcite .",
    "we have seen that collisions with grains as large as a few cm in size are frequent enough inside the pre - collapse fragments ( see  [ sec : internal ] ) to limit grain size by fragmentation .",

    ", the trends of the low opacity td models for giant planet formation directly contradict the observations .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : mcores ] that low metallicity environments would be more hospitable to planet formation via gi / td models _ if _ radiative cooling was the bottle neck for giant planet contraction , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "this trend is exactly opposite to what is observed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : mcores ] , the core masses assembled by such rapidly collapsing gas fragments would be rather small , @xmath332 .",
    "when the `` low opacity '' run fragments ( diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcores ] ) are tidally or thermally disrupted , the mass of their cores is far too small to explain rocky terrestrial planets , save for the more massive super - earth planets .    considering more massive gas fragments relaxes the requirement for the low opacity , as is seen from the sequence of squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcores ] . for @xmath286 ,",
    "the required reduction in opacity is only a factor of @xmath333 , which is quite reasonable .",
    "however , the mass of the cores assembled inside such high mass planets is still very low .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "disruptions of high mass fragments would therefore fail to explain the abundant massive rocky planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the high mass gas fragments would also not be able to explain formation of lower mass giant planets , @xmath334 , which are much more abundant in the data than planets of mass @xmath335 .",
    "there is also no clear reason why the high mass radiatively cooling fragments would follow a positive metallicity correlation .",
    "finally , whatever the mass of the gas fragment , the low opacity models do not provide an explanation for why giant planets are found to be much more abundant in metals than their host stars .",
    "therefore , it is our opinion that in terms of development of td planet formation theory that could account for all types of observed planets , low dust opacity models are not only physically unlikely , they are a dead end .    in contrast , pebble accretion models ( i ) yield a positive planet - metallicity corelation @xcite ; ( ii ) are very metal rich , e.g. , @xmath336 ( cf .",

    "we conclude that fragments cooling and contracting radiatively rather than due to pebble accretion are not likely to explain observed planets .",
