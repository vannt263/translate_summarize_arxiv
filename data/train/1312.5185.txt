    "the abstract equation includes many stochastic wave equations ( swes ) in applications @xcite . since",
    "their true solutions are rarely known explicitly , numerical simulations are often used to understand the behavior of the solutions . to do this",
    ", one has to discretize both the time interval @xmath21 $ ] and the infinite dimensional space @xmath11 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the main difficulty in studying numerical schemes for stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) of evolutionary type lies in the treatment of the time discretization . on the one hand , development of",
    "effective high order time - stepping schemes are important since better time integration technology gives significant performance improvements in the numerical solution of spdes .",
    "this issue is , however , essentially difficult , even in the context of finite dimensional stochastic ordinary differential equations ( sodes ) @xcite .",
    "time discretizations of spdes encounter all the difficulties that arise in the time approximations of both deterministic pdes and finite dimensional sodes as well as many more due to the infinite dimensional nature of the driving noise processes . on the other hand ,",
    "as one can see in our forthcoming work , the arguments used in the following analysis of pure time discretization can be extended to the analysis of fully discretized scheme when combined with arguments used in the deterministic theory .",
    "for instance , optimal error estimates for the deterministic wave equation obtained in @xcite allow us to analyze a fully discretized scheme with finite element spatial discretization . therefore , and also for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we first concentrate on the time discretization of in this paper .    on the interval",
    "@xmath21 $ ] , we construct a uniform mesh @xmath22 satisfying @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , being the time stepsize .",
    "this article is concerned with the following scheme for the time discretization of : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 $ ] are the cosine and sine operators and @xmath30 is the wiener increment . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , temporal approximations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 at the grid points @xmath35 . rewriting in another abstract form ( see )",
    ", one can observe that the scheme can be identified with a version of the stochastic exponential euler scheme in the literature @xcite , where the schemes were designed for parabolic spdes . by choosing particular filter functions ,",
    "the stochastic exponential euler scheme can be viewed as a stochastic trigonometric method for nonlinear problems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 2 ) .",
    "recently , cohen , larsson and sigg @xcite applied the stochastic trigonometric method to the linear swe with additive noise , which coincides with the scheme when applied to the linear case . in the first part of this article",
    ", we establish the uniform @xmath0-convergence of the scheme in a general framework for nonlinear problems , which of course extends the @xmath36-convergence results in @xcite for the linear case .",
    "to get started , we make the following assumptions .    [ assump : fg ]",
    "assume @xmath37 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 are deterministic mappings satisfying @xmath38 for all @xmath39 and some positive constants @xmath40 .",
    "for notations , we refer to the next section . throughout this article , we choose @xmath41 to be a universal constant in all assumptions . under assumption",
    "[ assump : fg ] , possesses a unique mild solution ( theorem [ thm : unique.mild ] ) .",
    "moreover , the spatial regularity properties of the mild solution and its numerical approximations are investigated under the above assumption ( proposition [ prop : mb.x.xm ] ) .",
    "further , we establish the main strong convergence result , theorem [ thm : strong.conv.result ] , which shows that the scheme is convergent uniformly in the strong @xmath0-sense , @xmath42 . in particular , we show @xmath43 here , and throughout this work , @xmath44 is a constant that may vary from one place to another and depends on @xmath45 and the initial data @xmath46 , but is independent of @xmath47 . to derive",
    "the uniform bound , a continuous - time extension of @xmath48 is introduced and the group property of the operator family @xmath49 is exploited .",
    "then , several concrete examples including swes with general additive noise , multiplicative trace class noise and multiplicative space - time white noise are presented to fit in the above setting .",
    "for the three different cases , is then applied with precise convergence rates given .",
    "it is shown that the spatial regularity of the noise term determines the order of strong convergence . moreover , unlike the parabolic case , the exponential euler scheme achieves higher strong order than the implicit euler and crank - nicolson time discretizations do ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting finding is that , for the particular case of multiplicative trace - class noise the scheme can achieve the strong convergence order of one , which is , as one can see later , the ultimate limit on the rate one can achieve for .",
    "this upper limit on convergence order can be also found in @xcite .    for the case of additive noise satisfying @xmath50 we also measure the weak error @xmath51 - \\mathbb{e } \\ !",
    "\\left[\\varphi ( u_m)\\right ] \\big|$ ] for a class of test functions @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "we mention that the essential condition has been used in @xcite to carry out the weak convergence analysis of numerical schemes for the linear swe .",
    "also , we emphasize that the presence of the nonlinear term leads to non - trivial technical difficulties in the analysis of weak error . indeed , in the weak error analysis for linear spdes with additive noise @xcite , whose solution can be written down explicitly , one can get rid of the irregular term involving the unbounded operator by a transformation of variables .",
    "this transformation , however , does not work for the nonlinear heat equation . since the operator family @xmath49 is a group",
    "( see the next section ) , one can adapt the basic line of @xcite to make the weak error analysis easier . instead of imposing very strong spatial regularity conditions on the nonlinearities (",
    "* hypothesis 5.7 , 5.8 ) , we make certain relatively mild assumptions on the nonlinearity @xmath54 ( c.f .",
    "theorem [ thm : weak.conv.result ] and corollary [ cor : weak.error ] ) .",
    "for instance , the assumptions do not require @xmath54 to be twice frchet differentiable in @xmath11 , which is in general not fulfilled for nemytskij operators but was commonly demanded in the weak error analysis @xcite .",
    "moreover , a key condition on @xmath54 ( see ) is used to avoid techniques involving the malliavin calculus . under such assumptions",
    "we obtain @xmath55 - \\mathbb{e } \\",
    "! \\left [ \\varphi ( u_m ) \\right ] \\big| \\leq c_{\\epsilon } \\tau^{\\min ( 2\\beta , \\frac{1}{2 } + \\beta - \\epsilon , 1 ) } \\ ] ] with arbitrarily small @xmath56 .",
    "as expected , the rate of weak convergence is , up to an arbitrarily small @xmath56 in some cases , twice that of strong convergence .",
    "eventually , the assumptions we put are illustrated by a concrete setting .    in summary , the contribution of this article to the numerical analysis of swes is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "a unified abstract framework is formulated and a high order time - stepping scheme is proposed for nonlinear swes . within the abstract framework ,",
    "strong convergence of the exponential euler scheme is studied thoroughly .",
    "the framework is general as it covers cases of additive noise , multiplicative trace - class noise as well as multiplicative space - time white noise . on the other hand",
    ", we provide a weak error analysis which does not rely on the malliavin calculus , while techniques based on the malliavin calculus were usually exploited in the course of weak error analysis for the nonlinear case @xcite .",
    "both strong and weak convergence results show that the proposed scheme attains higher convergence rates than the implicit euler and crank - nicolson time discretizations .    finally , we mention that parabolic spdes have been extensively studied from the numerical point of view .",
    "the readers are referred to a review article @xcite , a relevant monograph @xcite and more recent doctor thesis @xcite for numerous references .",
    "the numerical research of stochastic wave equation , however , is in its beginning .",
    "available results @xcite are much less compared with the numerical analysis of stochastic parabolic problems , which also partly motivates this work .",
    "a brief outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we collect some preliminaries and formulate an abstract framework . in section [",
    "sect : stongconvergence ] , we analyze the strong approximation error arising from the time discretization .",
    "then in section [ sec : examples ] , several examples are included , which fit in the abstract setting , to illustrate our abstract results .",
    "weak convergence of the scheme is studied in section [ sec : weak.convergence ] for the case of additive noise .",
