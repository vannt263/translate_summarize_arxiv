    "recent experimental studies have shown that the ultrastrong coupling regime , where the coupling strength is some tenths of the mode frequency , can be achieved in a number of implementations such as superconducting circuits @xcite , semiconductor quantum wells @xcite , possibly also in surface acoustic waves @xcite and trapped ions @xcite .",
    "the fast - growing interest in the ultrastrong coupling regime is motivated not only by theoretical predictions of novel fundamental properties liberato , felicetti2 , felicetti3 but also by potential applications in quantum computing tasks @xcite .",
    "the advent of these impressive experimental results prompts a number of theoretical efforts to give analytical solutions for the quantum rabi and dicke models @xcite by applying various techniques @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the models are expanded to more general cases , including different qubits @xcite , anisotropic couplings @xcite , a finite - size ensemble of interacting qubits @xcite and two - photon interactions @xcite , to name only a few .",
    "in particular , people start to tackle the entanglement features both between the qubit and the field and inside the qubit system , yet with the rotating wave approximation @xcite .",
    "entanglement , as a fundamental quantum mechanical tool describing the non - local correlations between quantum objects , lies at the heart of quantum information sciences @xcite .",
    "it is highly expected that nontrivial population and entanglement dynamics would emerge in the ultrastrong coupling regime where the rwa fails . for the rabi model , a displaced fock state method @xcite is developed to analytically predict the time evolution of the qubits occupation probability in the case of strong coupling and large detuning .",
    "the key step is the adiabatic approximation which nicely truncates the system hamiltonian into a block diagonal form and the resulted solutions are utilized to study the entanglement dynamics in the two - qubit system @xcite .",
    "specifically , a simple expression of the concurrence @xcite for the two qubits is given analytically and the entanglement sudden death appears even in the inhomogeneous coupling case .",
    "the circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) architecture offers considerable potential for simulating such dynamics following an analog - digital approach @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this study is stimulated by a lack of an analytical analysis of the bipartite entanglement inside the multi - qubit system in the ultras - trong coupling regime .",
    "typical model for this is the three - qubit dicke model characterized by a realistic realization of a ghz state @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that superconducting circuit technology allows to exploit the the dynamical casimir effect physics as a useful resource for the generation of highly entangled states for multi superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "it is thus desirable to demonstrate whether the sudden death of entanglement would survive the dissipative effects for the strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes @xcite . here",
    ", we show the robustness of three - qubit ghz state against the interaction and the energy exchange between the qubits and the field in the dicke model , which could be of importance for future applications e.g. in quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum computation @xcite and quantum gates @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we solve the three - qubit dicke model in a spin-3/2 subspace and derive the analytical eigen solutions by means of the adiabatic approximation in sec .",
    "these results are applied to study the population dynamics of the three qubits coupled to , respectively , a fock state and a coherent state of the oscillator in sec .",
    "the spectrum of the multi - revival signal is analyzed and compared to the numerical calculation without the adiabatic approximation .",
    "then , we explore the entanglement dynamics for three qubits starting from the ghz state and the field in a coherent state and show the robustness of the ghz state through the bipartite entanglement measure @xmath0 tangle in sec .",
    "v. finally , a brief summary is presented in sec .",
    "we consider the three - qubit dicke model described by the following hamiltonian ( @xmath1 ) @xcite@xmath2here @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the single bosonic mode with frequency @xmath5 , @xmath6 denotes the qubit splitting , the constant @xmath7 represents the coupling between the qubit and field mode , and the total spin operator is the sum of the pauli operators of the individual qubits , i.e. @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . note that @xmath10 commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , i.e. @xmath11 = 0 $ ] ,",
    "this provides a splitting of the eight - dimensional spin space into a quadruplet state space @xmath12 and two doublet state spaces @xmath13 , @xmath14which comes from three possible standard young tableaux @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 in representation theory of permutation group theory @xcite .",
    "the three - qubit dicke model thus decomposes into a system of one spin-3/2 and two spin-1/2 rabi models @xcite . while both models have been solved using the displaced fock space method @xcite and bargmann - space techniques @xcite , little attention has been paid to the analytical dynamics of the qubit occupation probability due to the cumbersome task in extracting the analytical solution in both formulations .",
    "indeed the power series must be terminated in the transcendental function @xmath18 @xcite , or the expansion of the wave function in terms of displaced fock space should be truncated in a finite @xmath19 subspace @xcite .    here ,",
    "similar to the cases of single- @xcite and two - qubit agarwal , mao rabi model , we apply the adiabatic approximation to the numerical solutions when the frequencies of the qubits are much smaller than the oscillator frequency @xmath20 . in this displaced oscillator basis",
    "the hamiltonian may be truncated to a block - diagonal form and the blocks solved individually .",
    "we shall confine ourselves in the following to the system with four - dimensional spin - subspace of @xmath12 , due to the fact that all interesting dynamics in the three - qubit system prepared in the experiments is confined in this subspace , and best of all , this method is the most effective way to study analytically the dynamical properties of three qubits .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath21 reduces to @xmath22 block diagonal form , i.e. @xmath23 with @xmath24where @xmath25 .",
    "the system is spanned by the the joint spin - field space @xmath26 where @xmath27 are eigenstates of @xmath10 and @xmath28 with eigenvalues @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , and the displaced fock states satisfy @xmath31with @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements in the matrix are given by@xmath35^{2}}\\alpha ^{2\\left ( n - l\\right ) } .",
    "\\label{omega}\\]]it can be easily proved that the parity operator defined in the spin-3/2 subspace as @xmath36 $ ] with eigenvalues @xmath37 , commutes with the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath38 = 0 $ ] .",
    "accordingly , the hilbert space splits into two mutually orthogonal subspaces with even and odd parities @xcite .",
    "the four eigenstates of @xmath39 are non - degenerate and can be classified uniquely by one quantum number .",
    "however , for numerical solutions beyond the adiabatic approximation , it is necessary to use the parity operator to classify the degeneracies that take place between levels of states with different parity . for consistency ,",
    "we use parity invariance @xmath40 = 0 $ ] with @xmath41 an anti - diagonal matrix @xmath42 $ ] , to further block diagonalize @xmath39 as @xmath43 with @xmath44and @xmath45 .",
    "the energy levels are given by@xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates in the spin - field space are @xmath48with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we restrict the analysis in the following to the case of @xmath51 fulfilled by most experimental systems in the ultra - strong coupling regime @xmath52 , which enables us to achieve an analytical dynamics below .",
    "the eigenvalues are therefore simplified to@xmath53 and the corresponding eigenfunctions are@xmath54we observe that the parity @xmath55 and the photon number @xmath56 in the displaced fock state are independent to each other .",
    "this is due to the fact that in constructing the unitary transformation which brings the hamiltonian into a block diagonal form ( [ h3 ] ) , a phase difference @xmath57 is introduced in the superposition of two displaced fock states @xmath58 in opposite directions so that symmetric and antisymmetry superposition states of the corresponding bases are respectively even and odd parities .",
    "this situation resembles the parity of the ground state and the first excited state in the standard quantum tunneling model of double well potential .",
    "after a detailed discussion of the energy spectrum , we now turn to the study of population dynamics of the qubits . in particular",
    ", we will examine the dynamics with all three qubits being excited to the upper level @xmath59 , while the initial state of the oscillator is prepared in the displaced fock basis corresponding to it , i.e. @xmath60 , which is expressed as the linear combination of the eigenvectors ( [ eigenstate1 ] ) @xmath61then at subsequent time @xmath62 the probability to find three qubits in the initial state @xmath63 is easily obtained @xmath64substituting the simplified eigensolutions ( [ eigenergy2 ] ) and ( eigenstate3 ) into eq . ( [ fp ] ) , we find that the probability is composed of three oscillating frequencies @xmath65while in the single- and two - qubit rabi models we have respectively one and two frequencies dominating the evolution .     of finding three qubits in the initial state",
    "@xmath63 as a function of @xmath66 for @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

( [ population ] ) into the following analytical form @xmath79 , \\label{population3}\\]]with @xmath80 .",
    "the collapse and revival of the probability @xmath81 , which is approximated with fairly good accuracy by the sufficiently simple function @xmath82 , is obvious here and the individual revival function @xmath83with a height @xmath84 and @xmath85-th revival time @xmath86 where we have defined @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . during each peroid @xmath90 , however , the signals in @xmath91 and @xmath92 revive twice and three times respectively .",
    "we thus get three revival sequences in the evolution of the probability @xmath93 .",
    "the envelope and the fast oscillatory of the revival signal are determined by @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , a comparison of the analytic formula derived for @xmath93 and the numerical calculations is made in the parameter regime where the coupling strength is strong enough to invalidate the rwa .",
    "we see that with the time increasing the equilibrium value @xmath96 , about which the revival signal oscillates , is smaller than @xmath97 in the single qubit model and @xmath98 in the two - qubit model @xcite due to the involvement of higher order harmonic signals in the probability .",
    "the width of the successive revival signals keeps increasing as @xmath99 that leads to the mergence of the third harmonic signal into the first and second ones after several revival periods .",
    "the salient feature of the three - qubit model as demonstrated above is that the revival signals corresponding to the three oscillating terms @xmath100 and @xmath101 produce a beat note of @xmath102 .",
    "the three revival sequences in the evolution of @xmath93 are even clearer in the fourier analysis @xmath103 defined as @xmath104 which is presented in fig .",
    "2 . the spectral signals @xmath105 corresponding to the probability of displaced fock state are @xmath106 functions located at @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "the involvement of fock states of many photons in the coherent state leads to a broad distribution of the spectral functions for @xmath110 at a fundamental frequency @xmath111 , which is @xmath112 for @xmath113 and @xmath69 , as well as at the second and third harmonics with decreasing magnitude .",
    "this contrasts the single and double revival sequences for the single and two - qubit systems as a consequence of having only one and two rabi frequencies , respectively , which have been showed in @xcite .",
    "the analytical results reproduce the multiple revival sequences for the three - qubit model , except that breakups appear in the main and the second harmonic revival frequencies if no adiabatic approximation is made , which can be compared with the rwa case in @xcite . we find that the rwa completely breaks down in the ultra strong coupling parameter regime considered here .     and the breakups in the fundamental and the second harmonic frequencies without the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the corresponding parameters are the same as in figure [ fig1].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the entanglement properties of two identical qubits strongly coupled to a single - mode radiation field have recently been studied in @xcite , where the entanglement sudden death does appear in the numerical and analytic calculations . however , qualitative differences should arise in the case of the three - qubit system .",
    "it is widely accepted nowadays that entangled states of multi - particle systems are the most promising resource for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to explore the entanglement dynamics of the three - qubit dicke model .    in this section",
    "we provide an easily computable formula for the entanglement dynamics when the field is initially in a coherent state @xmath114 and the three qubits are initially in the form of a familiar ghz state @xmath115 , i.e. @xmath116for small values of @xmath117 , we may expand the state @xmath118 in the displaced fock space and the most important contribution in the summation over @xmath56 comes from the terms with the same @xmath56 , which is equivalent to take @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "this approximation gives the state at subsequent time @xmath62 as @xmath120to examine the entanglement evolution of the system we calculate the reduced density matrix of the qubits by tracing over the quantum field @xmath121which can be reduced to the following matrix form@xmath122 in the eigen basis @xmath123 of spin @xmath124     tangle between the qubits and light field as a function of @xmath66 for transition frequency @xmath67 and different coupling strengthes @xmath125 and @xmath126 , given by numerical method ( left ) , the adiabatic approximation ( red solid line , right ) and analytical approach ( blue dashed line , right).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the entanglement between the field and the qubits may be described by the @xmath0 tangle @xmath127which is introduced in @xcite and applicable to infinite - dimensional bipartite systems @xcite .",
    "it runs from zero for a product state to the maximum value @xmath128 with @xmath129 for a maximally entangled state , where @xmath130 are respectively the dimensions of the three - qubit system and the photon field .",
    "the analytic expression for the reduced density matrix ( [ density ] ) allows us to obtain the explicit formula @xmath131 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the time evolution of @xmath0 tangle @xmath132 for various values of @xmath7 .",
    "should we adopt the expression ( [ eigenstate1 ] ) for the eigenstates @xmath133 and do not take into account @xmath119 , the adiabatic approximation produces a quite accurate result in the ultrastrong coupling regime as shown in the right column of fig .",
    "the analytic result determined by formula ( tangle2 ) agrees well with the envelope of the numerically evaluated result , but fails in describing the long time behavior when the coupling strengths are sufficiently large which is evident in fig .",
    "the @xmath0 tangle @xmath132 starts from zero for the initial product state ( intial state1 ) , and undergoes periodic weakening and recovery with the oscillation period getting smaller and smaller for increasing coupling strengths , which however could never reach the maximum entanglement value of the system .",
    "we see that the field - qubit entanglement exhibits collapse and revival and the analytic formula predicts correctly the main features of the individual entanglement revival signals .",

    "( [ density ] ) .",
    "we may analytically study the entanglement between the qubits in the following .",
    "the measures of entanglement for mixed states depend on the pure state decompositions , in this way the main difficulty is to find the minimization over all decompositions of mixed state into pure states .",
    "however , our analytic method provides a particular case , where @xmath134 is a rank-2 mixed state of a qubit and a qudit in the basis of the three - qubit product states .",
    "thus we may discuss the properties of the entanglement of three qubits system using the @xmath0 tangle proposed by osborne et al .",
    "@xcite . as a good mixed - state entanglement measure for three qubits ,",

    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the population and entanglement dynamics of three qubits within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "it works very well in the ultrastrong coupling regime under the assumption that the qubit frequencies are much smaller than the field frequency .",
