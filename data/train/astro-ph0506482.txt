    "nowadays it is widely accepted that the present stage of cosmic expansion is accelerated @xcite albeit there are rather divergent proposals about the mechanism behind this acceleration . a cosmological model of present acceleration should not only fit the high redshift supernovae data , the cosmic microwave background anisotropy spectrum and safely pass other tests , it must solve the coincidence problem as well , namely  why the universe is accelerating just now ? \" , or in the realm of einstein gravity  why are the densities of matter and dark energy of precisely the same order today ? \"",
    "@xcite -note that these two energies scale differently with redshift .",
    "while it might happen that this coincidence is just a  coincidence \" -and as such no explanation is to be found- we believe models that fail to account for this can not be regarded as satisfactory .    in a class of models designed to solve this problem the dark energy density  tracks \" the matter energy density for most of the history of the universe , and overcomes it only recently ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "however , these models suffer the drawback of fine - tuning the initial conditions whereupon they are not , after all , much better than the conventional  concordance \" model which rests on a mixture of matter and a fine - tuned cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "there is an especially successful subset of models based on an interaction between dark energy and cold matter ( i.e. , dust ) such that the ratio @xmath0 of the corresponding energy densities tends to a constant of order unity at late times @xcite thus solving the problem .",
    "however , the current observational information does not necessarily imply that @xmath0 ought to be strictly constant today .",
    "for the coincidence problem to be addressed a softer condition may suffice , namely that at present @xmath0 should be a slowly varying function of the scale factor with @xmath1 , the currently observed ratio . by _ slowly varying _ we mean that the current rate of variation of @xmath2 should be no much larger than @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the hubble factor of the friedamnn - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , and a zero subscript means present time .",
    "it should be noted that because the nature of dark matter and dark energy is largely unknown an interaction between both can not be excluded a priori . in fact , the possibility has been suggested from a variety of angles @xcite .    to avoid a possible conflict with observational constraints on long - range forces",
    "@xcite we consider that the baryon component of the matter does not participate in the the interaction and , further , to simplify the analysis -i.e .",
    ", in order not to have an uncoupled component- we exclude the baryons altogether .",
    "while this might be seen as a radical step it should be taken into account that our study restricts itself to times near the present time and these are characterized , among other things , by a low value of the baryon energy density ( @xmath5% or less of the total energy budget , approximately six times lower than the dark matter contribution and fourteen below the dark energy component @xcite ) whereby it should not significantly affect our results .",
    "this is in keeping with the findings of majerotto _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . for interacting models encompassing most the universe history in which the baryons enter the dynamical equations as a non - interacting component , see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the target of this paper is to present two models of late acceleration that fulfill  soft coincidence \" , namely : @xmath6 when the dark energy is a quintessence scalar field , and @xmath7 when the dark energy is a tachyon field .",
    "the latter was introduced by sen @xcite and soon afterwards it became a candidate for driving inflation as well as late acceleration -see e.g. , ref .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : section ii considers the quintessence model with a constant equation of state parameter .",
    "there it is assumed that the quintessence field slowly decays into dark matter with the equation of state of dust .",
    "section iii considers the tachyon field and again assumes a slowly decay into dust .",
    "this time , however , the equation of state parameter is allowed to vary . finally , section iv summarizes our findings .",
    "we consider a two - component system , namely , cold dark matter , described by an energy density @xmath8 , and a quintessence scalar field @xmath9 with energy density and pressure defined by + @xmath10 + respectively , in a spatially flat flrw universe .",
    "the over dot indicates derivative with respect to the cosmic time and @xmath11 is the quintessence scalar potential .",
    "we assume that these two components do not evolve separately but interact through a source ( loss ) term ( say , @xmath12 ) that enters the energy balances + @xmath13 + and + @xmath14 + where in view of ( [ rhop1 ] ) last equation is equivalent to + @xmath15 = - q .",

    "we also assume that the quintessence component obeys a barotropic equation of state , it is to say @xmath20 with @xmath21 a negative constant ( a distinguishing feature of dark energy fields -quintessence fields or whatever- is a high negative pressure ) . in virtue of these relations the set of dynamical equations reduces to a single equation + @xmath22 + whose solution is + @xmath23 + with + @xmath24 + and the prime means derivation with respect to @xmath25 . on the other hand , by combining friedmann s equation + @xmath26 + with eq .",

    "a negative @xmath31 would imply a transfer of energy from the matter to the scalar field which migth violate the second law of thermodynamics .",

    "we do not consider negative values for @xmath40 since it would imply that @xmath18 was increasing in the recent past and therefore that it oscillates . while we are unaware of any definitive argument against this possibility it looks certain that only contrived models may lead to this behavior .",
