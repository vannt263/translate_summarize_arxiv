    "to explain our results we assume parallel domains whose width and orientation depend on the values of @xmath138 and @xmath26 at the onset of the domain state , hence the dependence on magnetic history .",
    "we attribute the absorption peaks shown in figs.[fig : int - abs ] , [ fig : int - abs1 ] to the tail of the domain mode resonance .",

    "the latter can strongly affect the energy and structure of the domain walls and even drive the transition from the bloch to nel wall @xcite .",
    "when the field is lowered , the domain width changes but due to pinning some memory of the magnetic conditions at the onset of the multidomain state is conserved . since @xmath26 and @xmath138 play very different roles in establishing the domain state , the domain pattern and the frequency of the domain mode resonance ( eq.[eigenfrequency3 ] ) depend on field orientation during field sweep , hence the resulting absorption peak is strongly angular- and field - dependent",

    "<S> we studied magnetic - field induced microwave absorption in 100 - 200 nm thick la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 films on srtio@xmath2 substrate and found a low - field absorption with a very peculiar angular dependence : it appears only in the oblique field and is absent both in the parallel and in the perpendicular orientations . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this low - field absorption results from the ferromagnetic resonance in the multidomain state ( domain - mode resonance ) . </S>",
    "<S> its unusual angular dependence arises from the interplay between the parallel component of the magnetic field that drives the film into multidomain state and the perpendicular field component that controls the domain width through its effect on domain wall energy . </S>",
    "<S> the low - field microwave absorption in the multidomain state can be a tool to probe domain structure in magnetic films with in - plane magnetization . </S>"
