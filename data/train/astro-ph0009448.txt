    "observations with the _ einstein _ x - ray observatory showed that elliptical and s0 galaxies are luminous sources of x - ray emission ( e.g. , forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ) . at least for the x - ray luminous early - type galaxies ( defined as those having a relatively high ratio of x - ray to optical luminosity @xmath6 ) , the bulk of the x - ray luminosity is from hot ( @xmath0@xmath7 k ) interstellar gas .",
    "however , there is a large dispersion in the x - ray luminosities of early - type galaxies of a given optical luminosity .",
    "we will refer to galaxies which have a very low @xmath6 ratio as `` x - ray faint . '' in these x - ray faint ellipticals , much of the hot interstellar gas may have been lost in galactic winds or by ram pressure stripping by ambient intracluster or intragroup gas .",
    "the source of the bulk of the x - ray emission in x - ray faint galaxies is uncertain .    in general ,",
    "x - ray faint galaxies exhibit significantly different spectral properties than their x - ray bright counterparts .",
    "the x - ray bright galaxies are dominated by thermal emission at @xmath8 kev due to their hot interstellar medium ( ism ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray faint galaxies exhibit two distinct spectral components : first , they have a hard @xmath0510 kev component , most easily seen in _ asca",
    "_ spectra ( matsumoto et al .  1997 ) , which is roughly proportional to the optical luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "this suggests that the hard component is due to low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) like those seen in the bulge of our galaxy and m31 .",
    "x - ray faint galaxies also have a very soft ( @xmath00.2 kev ) component , whose origin is uncertain ( fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1994 ; pellegrini 1994 ; kim et al .",
    "1996 ) . suggested stellar sources for the very soft emission in x - ray faint ellipticals include active m stars , rs cvn binaries , or supersoft sources , but none of these appears to work quantitatively ( pellegrini & fabbiano 1994 ; irwin & sarazin 1998b ) .",
    "it is possible that the soft x - rays are due to warm ( 0.2 kev ) ism .",
    "recently , we proposed that the very soft emission in x - ray faint ellipticals is due to the same lmxbs responsible for the hard emission ( irwin & sarazin 1998a , b ) .",
    "however , the origin of the very soft component in x - ray faint ellipticals remains something of a mystery .    with the superb spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , it should be possible to resolve the emission from nearby x - ray faint early - type galaxies into lmxbs , if this is indeed the source of their emission",
    "recently , we used a deep _ rosat _ hri observation to detect a number of discrete x - ray sources in the x - ray faint elliptical ngc  4697 ( irwin , sarazin , & bregman 2000 , hereafter isb ) . however , the bulk of the x - ray emission was not resolved .",
    "we also simulated a 40 ksec _",
    "observation of ngc  4697 , and showed that it should be possible to detect @xmath0100 lmxbs if they provide the bulk of the emission . here , we present the results of exactly this observation . at a distance of 15.9 mpc ( faber et .",
    "al .  1989",
    "; assuming a hubble constant of 50 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) , ngc  4697 is the closest normal , optically luminous , x - ray faint elliptical galaxy .",
    "given its proximity , ngc  4697 is an ideal target for detecting the lmxb population .",
    "it is sufficiently x - ray faint that diffuse ism emission should not bury the fainter lmxbs .",
    "the purposes of the _ chandra _ observation are to resolve and study the lmxb population of ngc  4697 , to determine the source of both the hard and soft spectral components , and to detect or place strong limits on any residual diffuse ( possibly gaseous ) emission .",
    "ngc  4697 was observed on 2000 january 15 - 16 with the _ chandra _ acis - s3 detector for a total exposure of 39,434 s. the s3 chip was chosen because of its good low energy response .",
    "no background flares occurred during this observation .",
    "this observation was processed at a time when the standard pipeline processing introduced a boresight error of about 8  in the absolute positions of x - ray sources .",
    "the absolute positions were corrected by using the optical identifications and positions from usno - a2.0 ( monet et al .",
    "1998 ) of x - ray sources .",
    "the absolute positions are accurate to about 0.5  near the center of the s3 image , with larger errors further out .",
    "background was taken from the outer regions of the same chip and blank sky backgrounds .",
    "more details concerning the x - ray observation , data analysis , variability of the sources , and spectral fitting are given in sarazin , irwin , & bregman ( 2000 , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "2.75truein    0.2truein",
    "the _ chandra _ s3 chip x - ray image is shown in figure  [ fig : xray_whole ] .",
    "the central portion of the _ chandra _ image ( adaptively smoothed ) is shown in figure  [ fig : xray_mid ] .",
    "these images show the basic result of the _ chandra _ observation : much of the emission from the galaxy is resolved into individual point sources of x - rays (   [ sec : src ] ) .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : xray_mid ] indicates that there is also some unresolved , diffuse emission .",
    "the diffuse emission is centrally concentrated , and its x - ray surface brightness increases by about a factor of 30 into the center of the galaxy .",
    "both the point sources and the diffuse emission are elongated in the same direction as this e6 galaxy ( a position angle of 67@xmath9 ) .",
    "we determined the portion of the x - ray emission due to resolved sources and diffuse emission , both for the entire _ chandra _ x - ray band ( 0.310 kev ) and for three narrower bands : hard h ( 2 - 10 kev ) , medium m ( 1 - 2 kev ) , and soft s ( 0.3 - 1 kev ) . here , we report on the counts coming from within the elliptical optical isophote containing one half of the optical light ( `` one effective radius , '' semimajor axis @xmath10 , semiminor axis @xmath11 ) .",
    "first , the population of resolved sources was determined as discussed below (   [ sec : src ] ) .",
    "then , the total emission was determined , and the source flux subtracted to give the amount of unresolved emission .",
    "within one effective radius , 61% of the x - ray emission is resolved into individual x - ray sources for the total band . in the hard , medium , and soft bands , the resolved fractions are 81% , 79% , and 48% , respectively .",
    "thus , it is clear that the bulk of the total x - ray emission from ngc  4697 comes from point sources , which are likely to be lmxbs .",
    "2.75truein    0.2truein    a portion of the unresolved emission must also come from lmxbs which fall below our threshold for reliable detection of resolved sources .",
    "indeed , if one sets the detection threshold for sources lower , one finds many more 2-@xmath12 fluctuations than expected just from poisson statistics . if the observed luminosity function of the resolved sources in ngc  4697 ( fig .  [ fig : xlum ] below ) is extended down to @xmath13 ergs s@xmath3 , the approximate lower limit for lmxbs in globular clusters ( hertz & grindlay 1983 ) , the contribution of lmxbs to the total band x - ray emission from ngc  4697 increases to 74% within one effective radius .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the diffuse emission is somewhat softer than that of the resolved sources .",
    "if one decomposes the unresolved emission into two components , one with the same spectrum as that of the sum of the resolved sources plus a softer component , one finds that the lmxbs would contribute about 77% of the total band emission .",
    "the remaining @xmath023% of the emission would come from a more diffuse component with a soft ( @xmath00.3 kev ) spectrum .",
    "this soft component has a very extended spatial distribution ( paper ii ) , and is most likely due to interstellar gas .",
    "additional evidence for ism emission comes from the adaptively smoothed x - ray image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray_mid ] ) .",
    "if the diffuse x - ray emission is from a large number of faint stellar sources , then it should appear smooth and symmetrical ( like the optical image ) .",
    "the diffuse emission in figure  [ fig : xray_mid ] is smooth and fairly symmetric in the inner regions , but there is an extended asymmetrical feature at the outer regions to the northeast .",
    "such asymmetries are more easily produced in the distribution of gas ( e.g. , by ram pressure ) than in the distribution of stellar sources .",
    "the discrete x - ray source population on the acis s3 image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray_whole ] ) was determined , using a wavelet detection algorithm with the source detection threshold set at @xmath14 , which implies that @xmath151 false source ( due to a statistical fluctuation in the background ) would be detected in the entire s3 image .",
    "the minimum detectable flux was about @xmath16 cts s@xmath3 ( @xmath17 ergs s@xmath3 at the ngc  4697 distance ) in the 0.310 kev band in the part of the chip covered by the galaxy .",
    "fluxes were corrected for exposure and the instrument psf .",
    "a total of 90 sources were found ; a complete list with positions and other properties is given in paper ii .",
    "some of the detected sources are likely to be unrelated foreground or ( more likely ) background objects . based on the source counts in brandt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we would expect about 1015 unrelated sources in our observation .",
    "the unrelated sources should mainly be found at larger distances from the optical center of ngc  4697 , while the sources associated with ngc  4697 should be concentrated to the center of the galaxy . within 2  of the center of ngc 4697 ( roughly the region covered by fig .",
    "[ fig : xray_mid ] ) , @xmath03 of the @xmath060 detected sources would be expected to be unrelated to ngc  4697 .",
    "eight of the x - ray sources coincide ( within 1 ) with candidate globular clusters in ngc  4697 .",
    "cxou j124834.4 - 055014 ( paper ii , src .",
    "64 ) is identified with globular cluster 33 in hanes ( 1977 ) , while cxou j124846.8 - 054852 ( paper ii , src .",
    "72 , isb src .",
    "11 ) is associated with hanes globular cluster 24 .",
    "six additional x - ray sources ( cxou j124827.0 - 054925 , cxou j124826.1 - 054729 , cxou j124830.8 - 054836 , cxou j124834.2 - 054926 , cxou j124835.9 - 054551 , cxou j124841.5 - 054736 ) agree with the positions of candidate globulars kindly provided by kavelaars ( 2000 ) .",
    "given the positional agreement of the x - ray sources with the globular candidates , it is likely that all 8 of these identifications are real .",
    "however , at the distance to ngc  4697 , globular clusters are not resolved in ground - based optical images , and the candidate globulars were identified by luminosities and ( possibly ) colors . as a result , as many as half of them might be unrelated faint optical objects , rather than globular clusters .",
    "the count rates for the sources were converted into unabsorbed luminosities ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) assuming that all of the sources were at the distance of ngc  4697 . using the best - fit _",

    "the cumulative luminosity function of all of the sources is shown in figure  [ fig : xlum ] .",
    "note that the luminosity function appears to have a knee at @xmath18 ergs s@xmath3 . in fitting the luminosity function , we corrected for unrelated sources using the deep source counts ( brandt et al .",
    "2000 ; mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , assuming that the shape of the number versus flux relation is that derived from _",
    "deep fields ( hasinger et al .  1998 ) .",
    "a single power - law ( plus the background contribution ) fit to the luminosity function could be rejected at the @xmath1995% confidence level .",
    "however , a broken power - law fit was successful : @xmath20 with @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 . here , @xmath25 is the x - ray luminosity ( 0.310 kev ) in units of @xmath26 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the best fit , determined by the maximum - likelihood method , gave @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and a break luminosity of @xmath30 ergs s@xmath3 ( figure  [ fig : xlum ] ) .",
    "the errors ( at the 90% confidence level ) were determined by monte carlo simulations .",
    "2.00truein    0.2truein    the break luminosity is similar to the eddington luminosity for spherical accretion onto a 1.4 @xmath5 neutron star .",
    "this suggests that the sources with luminosities above this break are accreting black holes , while those below the break are predominantly neutrons stars .",
    "this would imply that ngc  4697 contains @xmath3115 luminous x - ray binary systems containing black holes .",
    "if the more luminous of these systems ( @xmath32 ergs s@xmath3 ) are limited by the eddington luminosity , they must contain fairly massive ( @xmath33 ) black holes .",
    "we studied the crude spectral properties of the resolved sources by using hardness ratios ( full results and spectral analysis in paper ii ) .",
    "hardness ratios or x - ray colors have the advantage that they can be applied to weaker sources . figure  [ fig : colors_noerr ] plots h31 vs.  h21 . for comparison ,",
    "the hardness ratios ( h21,h31 ) are @xmath34 for all of the emission , @xmath35 for the unresolved emission , and @xmath36 for the sum of the sources , all within one effective radius .",
    "there are three moderate luminosity sources with hardness ratios of @xmath37 , which means that they have no detectable emission beyond 1 kev .",
    "these three sources are almost certainly supersoft sources ( e.g. , kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 ) .",
    "there are three sources , one of which is the brightest source in the field , with values of @xmath0@xmath38 , all of which are located @xmath1935 from the center of ngc  4697 .",
    "these are probably unrelated , strongly absorbed agns .",
    "there are eight sources near @xmath39 which have essentially no hard emission .",
    "six of these sources are at large radii ( @xmath1922 ) , which suggests that this population is also unrelated to ngc  4697 .",
    "most of the sources lie in a diagonal swath centered at about @xmath40 .",
    "these values are similar to but slightly harder than the integrated colors for the entire galaxy , but considerably harder than the values for the unresolved emission .",
    "the x - ray sources identified with globular cluster candidates have hardness ratios which are similar to other lmxbs , with the exception of cxou j124834.4 - 055014 , whose hardness ratios suggest that it is actually a background agn .",

    "the dominance of lmxbs implies that this and other x - ray faint ellipticals have lost most of their interstellar gas .    of the remaining unresolved emission ,",
