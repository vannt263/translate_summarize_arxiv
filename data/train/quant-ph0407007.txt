    "practical quantum computation requires considering systems containing scalable number of qubits .",
    "recently , schemes have been proposed that employ more than two qubits to perform various quantum information tasks  @xcite .",
    "there is also an interest in performing quantum teleportation of state of more than one qubit .",
    "lee  @xcite has presented a setup for teleportation of an entangled state of two photons .",
    "the scheme , as some other schemes  @xcite , uses photons because they propagate fast and can carry quantum information over long distances . on the other hand ,",
    "photonic states are much worse for the storage of the quantum information than atomic states",
    ". the scheme does not provide a way to store the quantum information and therefore it will be difficult to use in quantum computing .",
    "other problem is that the scheme works only with a @xmath1 success rate .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed a novel scheme to teleport state of one atom using photonic states as a carriers of quantum information . in the scheme , the quantum information is stored in atomic states but the probability of successful teleportation is about @xmath2 .",
    "the protocol of the teleportation can be repeated to teleport an entangled state of two atoms .",
    "this method , however , has at the most only a @xmath3 success rate .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a scheme that allows the teleportation of an entangled state of two atoms with insurance .",
    "our device employs an atomic states for storage and photonic states to transfer quantum information .",
    "there are two distinguishing features of our protocol .",
    "first of them is that the probability of successful teleportation of the initial entangled state is about @xmath2 .",
    "second of them is that the initial state is not lost , when detection stage is unsuccessful , because of using _ local redundant encoding",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "hence the teleportation procedure can be repeated until the quantum transfer is successful .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the teleportation device in detail . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the operations manipulating a state of many atoms trapped in a cavity . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the protocol of the teleportation .",
    "v gives the numerical results .",
    "we consider the device composed of one cavity with three atoms inside , one cavity with two atoms inside , a 50 - 50 beam splitter , two lasers @xmath4 and @xmath5 with right- and two lasers @xmath6 and @xmath7 with left - circular polarized radiation and two detectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rys1.eps ] .",
    "and @xmath10 is teleported to bob s atoms @xmath11 and @xmath10.,width=302 ]    the atoms are assumed to be located in fixed positions along a line in a linear trap or an optical lattice inside an optical cavity .",
    "we also assume that the atoms are separated by at least one optical wavelength so they can be addressed individually by two different laser fields .",
    "the propagation directions of the two laser beams are very close to each other as to allow for effective transfer of photons from one beam to the other mediated by the atom .",
    "introducing two laser beams allows for reseting the atomic states .",
    "the cavity with two atoms inside and two lasers ( @xmath5 , @xmath7 ) with different polarizations belong to bob .",
    "the sender - alice has the other parts of the device .",
    "all the trapped atoms are modeled by three - level @xmath0 systems with an excited state @xmath12 and two ground states @xmath13 and @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rys2.eps ] .",
    "the excited state spontaneously decays with a rate @xmath15 .",
    "the transition @xmath16 is coupled to the cavity mode with frequency @xmath17 and coupling strength @xmath18 .",
    "the transition is also driven by a classical laser field with frequency @xmath19 which is the same as the cavity mode frequency . the coupling strength for this transition",
    "is denoted by @xmath20 . another classical laser field with different polarization couples to the @xmath21 transition with the coupling strength @xmath22 .",
    "the frequency of the laser field is @xmath23 .",
    "we define two detunings @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "atoms interacting with two classical laser fields and the quantized cavity mode.,width=264 ]    the evolution of the system is conditional .",
    "photon detection corresponds to action of the operator @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the annihilation operators for alice s and bob s cavity modes , respectively , @xmath29 denotes the cavity decay rate and @xmath30 is equal to unity when there is a click in the detector @xmath8 or minus unity for a click in @xmath9 . between the emissions evolution of the system",
    "is governed by the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 . in  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] )",
    "we define @xmath34 , where @xmath35 for the @xmath36th atom . in the far off resonance limit",
    "when @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we can eliminate adiabatically the level @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the conditions have to be even more restrictive in our teleportation protocol because only then we can properly estimate a phase shift factors for long evolution times .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in order to simplify the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] ) we also assume that @xmath41 and the product of the excited level saturation parameter and the spontaneous decay rate is much smaller than the decay rate of the cavity mode ( @xmath42 ) . under these conditions",
    "we can neglect the influence of the spontaneous decay rate on teleportation .",
    "otherwise , the probability of success will be much lower as it was proved in  @xcite .",
    "these assumptions were also used in another quantum information process of entangled state preparation  @xcite . with these assumptions , after adiabatic elimination of the excited state @xmath12 of the atoms , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 account for various contributions to the effective hamiltonian , for example , @xmath51 describes the transfer of photon from one laser beam to the other via coupling to the atom , @xmath52 describes the transfer of photon from a cavity into the laser @xmath53 beam , etc . in this",
    "approximations all the atomic dynamics are restricted to the ground states @xmath13 and @xmath14 which can be treated as atomic qubits .",
    "in our teleportation protocol we need certain transformations or quantum operations , which applied to a given state of the system ( quantum register ) transform it into another state .",
    "such operations are performed with the unitary evolution operator @xmath54 applied to the state of the system .",
    "it is assumed that only one atom is illuminated at a time and that the laser fields are such that @xmath55 .",
    "it is useful to distinguish between the results of the action of the evolution operator onto particular states of the system and write down explicitly the results for some special cases .",
    "we list a number of local operations that can be performed by alice and bob on their states .    to fix and simplify the notation we label the alice atoms with numbers @xmath56 and bob s atoms with numbers @xmath57 .",
    "let us denote a state of the system of @xmath58 atoms trapped in the cavity with @xmath59 photons by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the @xmath36th atom state ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this means that the state of the alice part has the form @xmath63 and the bob part has the form @xmath64 , for example , @xmath65 means that at the alice site atoms @xmath56 are all in their state @xmath14 and the cavity field is in state @xmath13 . in our notation , the first two or three numbers in the ket denote atomic states with labels increasing from left to right , and the last number is reserved for the field state .",
    "the joint state of the entire system can be described in the basis that is formed by the product states of the alice part and the bob part .",
    "later on , we use the simplified notation @xmath66 .",
    "the simplest operation is just waiting for an arbitrary time @xmath67 while all of the lasers are turned off . in this case both @xmath68 and @xmath20 are set to zero , and we can use the simplified hamiltonian given by @xmath69 during this operation the evolution of the system is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of atoms being in state @xmath13 that are not illuminated by the laser field . in order to simplify the following transformations we assume @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , we want the probability of no collapse during the encoding stage to be close to unity .",
    "this can be done provided that @xmath73 .",
    "those assumptions imply that @xmath74 and therefore the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath75 for the operation time @xmath76 .",
    "thus , for short times the evolution simplifies to @xmath77 where @xmath78 .    as the next local operation we consider the illumination of the @xmath36th atom by the laser field driving @xmath21 transition ( @xmath79 )",
    "while the second laser field coupled to @xmath80 is turned off ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we can use this laser field to get a number of useful transformations .",
    "the transformations times are of the order of @xmath82 and therefore under conditions @xmath72 and @xmath83 the system evolution can be well approximated by the relation @xmath84 where , , @xmath85 t /2\\right\\}$ ] , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "one can see that we are able to perform different transformations by illuminating the @xmath36th atom for different times .",
    "we map the atomic state onto the cavity mode by choosing the interaction time @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an integer , according to @xmath90    if we turn the laser on for time @xmath91 then we create a maximally entangled state of the illuminated atom and the cavity system according to @xmath92 interaction for time @xmath93 gives only the phase factor @xmath94    the transformations can also be performed for the states with @xmath95 .",
    "the states mapping can be done for the illumination time @xmath96 where @xmath97 is an integer as @xmath98 interaction for the time @xmath99 leads to generation of maximally entangled state @xmath100 and illumination for the time @xmath101 generates only a phase factor .",
    "there is a special state with @xmath102 .",
    "if laser is turned on , the state accumulates a phase shift but the population of the state remains unchanged as described by @xmath103 when we want to map an arbitrary superposition of the two atomic ground states onto the cavity mode then this feature of the state is very desired . however , when the detection stage is unsuccessful in our protocol , the population transfer is necessary to repeat the teleportation process",
    ". therefore we have to use another local operation consisting in simultaneous applying of two laser fields with different polarizations ( for instance @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) . for evolution times of the order of @xmath104 we can neglect in the hamiltonian all terms much smaller than @xmath51 ,",
    "then the approximate state dynamics are given by @xmath105 it is evident that by using @xmath106 pulse we can change the atom state even if the cavity field mode is empty .",
    "this case can be described by @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "the set of transformations listed above forms necessary ingredients for the teleportation protocol we present in the next section .",
    "the teleportation protocol we propose here makes it possible to teleport an entangled state of two atoms with insurance .",
    "the state to be teleported is an entangled state of atoms @xmath11 and @xmath10 at alice site , which is latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : statezero }     the alice cavity and both bob s atoms are prepared in their states @xmath14 .",
    "the field modes in both cavities are initially empty .",
    "thus , the joint state of the entire system is initially given by @xmath110 we assume that this state is given or prepared before the protocol starts .    the teleportation protocol consist of five stages : ( i ) preparation stage , ( ii ) encoding stage , ( iii ) detection stage i , ( iv ) detection stage ii and ( v ) recovery stage . in each stage",
    "there are a number of steps to be performed in order to get , finally , the required result .",
    "the aim of the preparation stage of the protocol is to create a maximally entangled state of the third alice atom and the first bob atom .",
    "this can be done by following the distant atom entangling technique of ref .",
    "this stage consists of three steps .    _",
    "( a ) _ first , alice and bob perform transformation given by  ( [ eq : ud ] ) .",
    "they simply illuminate , using lasers @xmath4 and @xmath5 their atoms , _",
    "i.e. _ , alice s atom 3 and bob s atom 1 , for the time @xmath111 .",
    "after this operation each cavity is in one photon state .",
    "_ ( b ) _ next , they wait until either of alice s detectors clicks .",
    "all lasers are turned off and therefore , before the detection event , evolution of their systems is described by  ( [ eq : oper_0 ] ) .",
    "one photon registered by alice corresponds to an action of the collapse operator  ( [ eq : operatorcoll ] ) and leads to creation of maximally entangled state of both cavity fields .    _",
    "( c ) _ after the detection event , alice and bob have to turn on the lasers @xmath4 and @xmath5 , immediately .",
    "they illuminate the two atoms for time @xmath112 performing the transformation given by  ( [ eq : ud_b ] ) .",
    "this operation leads to mapping and storage of the entangled state of both cavity fields in the state of alice s atom 3 and bob s atom 1 .",
    "this concludes creating a maximally entangled state of the two atoms and then the global system state is given by @xmath113      the encoding stage is introduced to apply the local redundant encoding  @xcite in which alice codes the entangled state of her first two atoms ( atoms 1 and 2 ) , that is to be teleported , to the entangled state of four atoms ( atoms 1,2,3 of alice and atom 1 of bob ) .",
    "the third alice atom and the first bob atom are the backup atoms which allow to protect the teleported state in case of protocol failure in the detection stage .",
    "the encoding consists of a sequence of four steps .    _",
    "( a ) _ first of them is mapping the state of the first alice atom onto the cavity mode by illuminating ( using laser @xmath4 ) the atom for time @xmath112 .",
    "this corresponds to the transformations given by  ( [ eq : ud ] ) and  ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) . during the operation",
    "bob s lasers are turned off and therefore he uses transformation  ( [ eq : oper_0 ] ) . after the operation",
    "the unnormalized joint state becomes @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "_ ( b ) _ the second step of the encoding stage is illuminating the third alice atom .",
    "one can see that @xmath116 in all terms of the superposition  ( [ eq : psi2 ] ) .",
    "the purpose of the second operation is to make @xmath117 s different .",
    "the rabi frequency scales with @xmath118 and therefore we can perform independly different transformations for different values of @xmath118 .",
    "alice switches the laser @xmath4 on for the appropriate interaction time leading to the transformations  ( [ eq : ud ] ) , ( [ eq : ud_b ] ) , ( [ eq : ud2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the time has to satisfy conditions @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this can be done only approximately for @xmath121 and @xmath122 . during this step bob",
    "waits with lasers turned off thus evolution of state of his system is given by  ( [ eq : oper_0 ] ) .",
    "after this operation we achieve the state close to @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "we neglect the low populated states in the superposition  ( [ eq : fi3 ] ) but we include them as all other imperfections of the operation in our numerical calculations .    _ ( c ) _ the third step is the most important at the encoding stage .",
    "the previous two steps are intended to prepare the third one , which creates the entangled state of three atoms and cavity field . in order to make",
    "the entangled state alice has to swap one pair of the state amplitudes without exchanging the second pair of amplitudes .",
    "alice can do that by turning on the @xmath4 laser and illuminating her second atom for the time which leads to completing the transformations  ( [ eq : n ] ) , ( [ eq : ud2 ] ) , ( [ eq : ud2_b ] ) and ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) . here , we meet the same problem as in the second step because the illuminating time has to satisfy two conditions : @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "we can find an approximate solution for @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in this step bob s lasers are turned off .",
    "just as in the previous step , we neglect the states for which the population is close to zero and obtain @xmath129 where @xmath130 .",
    "although the entangling is already done , one can see that the state  ( [ eq : psi4 ] ) is not protected yet .",
    "for instance , if the two - photon state is detected then the initial state of the first two alice atoms will be lost .    _",
    "( d ) _ in order to change the state  ( [ eq : psi4 ] ) into a protected state alice illuminates her third atom using the @xmath4 laser .",
    "this is the fourth step of the encoding stage .",
    "alice needs to perform transformations  ( [ eq : n ] ) , ( [ eq : ud2_b ] ) and ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) , therefore the illumination time has to fulfill the conditions @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "it is obvious that the time is the same as for the previous operation time and thus @xmath133 .",
    "we again neglect low populated states . during",
    "this step bob performs two operations .",
    "first , bob waits for time @xmath134 with lasers turned off .",
    "next he creates a maximally entangled state of his second atom and his cavity . for this purpose",
    "he turns the laser @xmath5 on for time @xmath135 performing the transformation given by  ( [ eq : ud ] ) .",
    "alice and bob perform their actions in such a way that they end the fourth step at the same time .",
    "then the global system is given by @xmath136    this is the end of the encoding stage .",
    "if we wanted to store the protected state we would map the cavity state to the first alice atom state .",
    "then we would have the entangled state of four atoms .",
    "however , we want the photonic state to be the state  ( [ eq : psi5 ] ) because we use the cavity field for quantum information transfer .",
    "the third stage of the protocol is the first detection stage , in which alice just waits for time @xmath137 making a measurement of the fields leaking from the cavities .",
    "the detection of one photon only leads to the quantum information transfer . if alice does not detect any photon or detects two photons",
    "the teleportation process will be unsuccessful .",
    "however , even then , quantum information will be safe owing to the local redundant encoding . in the absence of any laser field the evolution is given by  ( [ eq : oper_0 ] ) .",
    "if alice does not detect any photon in this stage the state evolves into @xmath138 this is one of two unsuccessful cases .",
    "the initial state which alice wanted to teleport is modified by phase shift factors but it is not lost .",
    "the modified initial state is stored in the second and third alice atoms . in order to repeat the whole protocol alice",
    "has to reset her first atom .",
    "she turns on both her lasers ( @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) for the time @xmath139 performing transformation  ( [ eq : oper_powrot ] ) . during the reseting operation both",
    "bob s lasers are turned off .    if the evolution given by  ( [ eq : oper_0 ] ) is interrupted by a collapse at time @xmath140 then the jump operator @xmath141 acts on the global system state .",
    "after that the transformation  ( [ eq : oper_0 ] ) continues changing the state .",
    "if alice registers the second click of either of her detectors the joint state becomes @xmath142 it is evident that the alice initial state is not destroyed also in the second case when the step is unsuccessful . before the protocol",
    "can be repeated alice has to prepare her first atom in the state @xmath14 and bob has to prepare both of his atoms in the state @xmath14 using transformation  ( [ eq : oper_powrot ] ) .",
    "they reset the atoms in two steps .",
    "first , alice and bob turn on all their lasers ( @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 ) for the time @xmath139 .",
    "alice and bob illuminate their first atoms .",
    "next , bob illuminates for the time @xmath143 , using both his lasers , his second atom while alice waits with lasers turned off .      in the fourth stage of the protocol alice measures state of her third atom . during the stage bob",
    "waits with lasers turned off .",
    "this stage consists of two steps .    _",
    "( a ) _ first , alice turns the @xmath4 laser on and illuminates the third atom performing transformations  ( [ eq : ud ] ) and ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) .",
    "_ ( b ) _ after this she turns the laser off and the evolution is given by  ( [ eq : oper_0 ] ) which leads to the joint state @xmath145 making a measurement of the fields leaking from the cavities .",
    "the detection of one photon corresponds to an action of the jump operator @xmath141 on the global state  ( [ eq : psi_detekcja2_tlumienie ] ) . in this case",
    "the state becomes @xmath146 otherwise , when alice has not detected any photon , the joint state is given by @xmath147      generally , alice and bob may need the protocol to be repeated several times until alice registers only one click in the third stage .",
    "it is easy to prove that after @xmath148 repetitions of the protocol bob s system state is given by @xmath149 if alice has detected one photon in the fourth stage and @xmath150 if alice has not registered any detection in the fourth stage , where @xmath151 \\mu_{0}^{{\\cal n}_{0 } } \\mu_{2}^{{\\cal n}_{2}}$ ] , @xmath152 \\mu_{0}^{{\\cal n}_{0 } } \\mu_{2}^{{\\cal n}_{2}}$ ] , @xmath153 $ ] and @xmath154 $ ] .",

    "( c ) _ finally , he again turns the @xmath5 laser on illuminating his first atom for the time @xmath112 . in this way bob performs transformations  ( [ eq : ud_b ] ) and ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) .",
    "if no photon has been detected in the fourth stage bob performs four operations to remove the phase shift factor @xmath158 and to exchange the amplitudes .    _",
    "( a ) _ first , he turns the @xmath5 laser on and illuminates his first atom for the time @xmath112",
    ". he performs transformations  ( [ eq : ud ] ) and  ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) in this step .",
    "_ ( b ) _ next , he illuminates , using the @xmath5 laser , his second atom .",
    "he turns the laser off after the time @xmath112 when transformations  ( [ eq : ud ] ) and  ( [ eq : ud_b ] ) are done .    _",
    "( c ) _ next , he waits with lasers turned off for such time @xmath161 that @xmath162 .    _",
    "( d ) _ finally , he illuminates his first atom using the @xmath5 laser .",
    "he turns the laser off after the time @xmath112 . in this way he performs transformations  ( [ eq : ud_b ] ) and ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) .",
    "after the last stage of the protocol bob s system state is given by @xmath163 .",
    "in order to simplify the above considerations we have used some approximations and therefore the fidelity of the teleported state and the probability of the successful teleportation process have to be calculated numerically . both quantities depend on the moduli of the amplitudes @xmath164 and @xmath165 of the initial state  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need to calculate average values of the fidelity and probability taken over all input states .",
    "we compute the averages using the method of quantum trajectories  @xcite . in order to take also into account such imperfections as spontaneous emission from the excited states ,",
    "we have performed the numerical calculations with the full hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] ) .",
    "we can get individual trajectory by generating a random initial state and performing the whole teleportation protocol .",
    "the initial state will be successfully teleported when photon detections are only registered during the second step of the preparation stage , the detection stage i or the second step of the detection stage ii .",
    "the state will be lost when either of the detectors click during other steps of the protocol .",
    "the initial state can be also destroyed by spontaneous atomic emission .",
    "the trajectories in which the initial state is destroyed are counted as the unsuccessful cases .",

    "now , it is easy to check that the parameter values @xmath167 mhz satisfy the conditions . in order to make the average values reliable , we generate thirty thousand trajectories .",
    "we have got the average fidelity about @xmath168 and the average probability of success @xmath169 .",
    "these results show that the probability of success is much higher than the successful teleportation probability in other schemes  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the initial state is not lost in our scheme when alice s measurement is unsuccessful contrary to the other schemes , when the initial state is lost and the probability of success is equal or less than @xmath170 . owing to the local redundant encoding technique used in our scheme the initial state is protected and therefore the protocol can be repeated until only one photon is detected in the detection stage . figure  [ fig : ryspn.eps ] shows the probability to transmit the quantum state in the first try and in the subsequent repetitions .",
    "of the repetitions of the first detection stage . , width=302 ]",
    "as it is seen the probability that a single try will lead to the successful transfer of the initial state is about @xmath171 .",
    "moreover , one can see that the probability to achieve the successful teleportation process after @xmath148 repetitions saturates very quickly . therefore the protocol does not require great number of repetitions .    as mentioned above ,",
    "there are some imperfections in the encoding stage .",
    "this is obvious that the imperfections decrease the average fidelity of teleported state .",
    "also transformations recovering the original state can be done only approximately . in order to show the influence of the imperfections on the average fidelity we plot the average fidelity as a function of the number of the repetitions in fig .",

    "[ fig : rysfp.eps ] the increase of average fidelity can be achieved by accepting lower success rate .",
    "moreover , the increase of the average fidelity and the decrease of the average probability is higher for small number of cases counted as successful .",
    "when the repetition number limiting the successful cases is high the points become indistinguishable .",

    "the distinguishing feature of our protocol is using the local redundant encoding technique .",
    "we have shown feasibility of the technique in detail for atoms trapped in a cavity and manipulated by laser fields . since the technique codes the initial state in the way that the state is secure during the detection stage , the encoding procedure and the detection stage can be repeated until the teleportation is successful .",
    "the numerical calculations show that the average probability of success of the protocol is about @xmath172 while the average probability of successful teleportation without the insurance does not exceed @xmath170 .",
    "moreover , we have shown that not more than six repetitions are enough to obtain high average values of the probability and the fidelity of the teleportation .",
    "we have also shown that although the average fidelity is as high as @xmath173 , one can still increase it by rejecting the cases with too many repetitions and accepting lower success rate .",
    "in addition , we have shown how to manipulate states of many atoms trapped in a cavity using two lasers .",
    "we believe that the analytical results presented in sec .",
    "iii can be helpful for description of various atomic systems in optical cavities ."
