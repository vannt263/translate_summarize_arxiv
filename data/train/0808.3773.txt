    "in classical physics concepts of entropy quantify the extent to which we are uncertain about the exact state of a physical system at hand or , in other words , the amount of information that is lacking to identify the microstate of a system from all possibilities compatible with the macrostate of the system . if we are not quite sure what microstate of a system to expect , notions of entropy will reflect this lack of knowledge .",

    "we will encounter a non - zero entropy ! this entropy arises because of a very fundamental property of quantum mechanics : entanglement .",
    "this quite intriguing trait of quantum mechanics gives rise to correlations even in situations where the randomness can not be traced back to a mere lack of knowledge .",
    "the mentioned quantity , the entropy of a subregion is called _ entanglement entropy _ or _ geometric entropy _ and , in quantum information , _ entropy of entanglement _ , which represents an operationally defined entanglement measure for pure states ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the context of quantum field theory , questions of scaling of entanglement entropies in the size of @xmath3 have some tradition",
    ". seminal work on the geometric entropy of the free klein - gordon field @xcite and subsequent work on conformal field theories @xcite was driven in part by the intriguing suggested connection to the bekenstein - hawking black hole entropy @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", studies of properties of the entanglement entropy in this sense have enjoyed a revival initiated in refs .",
    "importantly , this renewed activity is benefitting from the new perspectives and ideas of quantum information theory , and from the realisation of their significance for the understanding of numerical methods and especially their efficiency for describing quantum many - body physics .",
    "quantum information theory also provides novel conceptual and mathematical techniques for determining properties of the geometric entropy analytically .    at the heart of these studies",
    "are questions like : what role do genuine quantum correlations  entanglement ",
    "play in quantum many - body systems ?",
    "typically , in such investigations , one abstracts to a large extent from the microscopic specifics of the system : quite in the spirit of studies of _ critical phenomena _ , one thinks less of very detailed properties , but is rather interested in the _ scaling _ of the entanglement entropy when the distinguished region grows in size .",
    "in fact , for quantum chains , this scaling of entanglement as genuine quantum correlations  a priori very different from the scaling of two - point correlation functions  reflects to a large extent the critical behavior of the quantum many - body system , and shares some relationship to conformal charges .    at first sight one",
    "might be tempted to think that the entropy of a distinguished region @xmath3 , will always possess an extensive character .",
    "such a behavior is referred to as a _",
    "volume scaling _ and is observed for thermal states .",
    "intriguingly , for typical ground states , however , this is not at all what one encounters : instead , one typically finds an _ area law _ , or an area law with a small ( often logarithmic ) correction : this means that if one distinguishes a region , the scaling of the entropy is merely linear in the _ boundary area _ of the region . the entanglement entropy is then said to fulfill an _",
    "area law_. it is the purpose of this article to review studies on area laws and the scaling of the entanglement entropy in a non - technical manner .    the main four motivations to approach this question ( known to the authors ) are as follows :    * * the holographic principle and black hole entropy : * the historical motivation to study the entanglement or geometric entropy stems from considerations of black hole physics : it has been suggested in the seminal work of refs .",
    "@xcite that the area law of the geometric entropy for a discrete version of a massless free scalar field  then numerically found for an imaginary sphere in a radial symmetry  could be related to the physics of _ black holes_,@xcite in particular the bekenstein - hawking entropy of a black hole which is proportional to its boundary surface .",
    "it has been muted that the _ holographic principle _ @xcite  the conjecture that the information contained in a volume of space can be represented by a theory which lives in the boundary of that region  could be related to the area law behavior of the entanglement entropy in microscopic theories . *",
    "* distribution of quantum correlations in quantum many - body systems : * area laws also say something quite profound on how quantum correlations are distributed in ground states of local quantum many - body systems .",
    "interactions in quantum many - body systems are typically local , which means that systems interact only over a short distance with a finite number of neighbors .",
    "the emergence of an area law then provides support for the intuition that short ranged interactions require that quantum correlations between a distinguished region and its exterior are established via its boundary surface .",
    "that a strict area law emerges is by no means obvious from the decay of two - point correlators , as we will see .",
    "quantum phase transitions are governed by quantum fluctuations at zero temperature , so it is more than plausible to observe signatures of _ criticality _ on the level of entanglement and _ quantum correlations_. this situation is now particularly clear in one - dimensional systems , @xcite but progress has also been made in higher - dimensional systems,@xcite with rigorous area laws specifically for quasi - free bosonic @xcite and fermionic @xcite systems , as well as in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "* * complexity of quantum many - body systems and their simulation : * one of the key motivations for studying area laws stems from a quite practical context : the numerical simulation of quantum many - body systems .",
    "in fact , if there is little entanglement in a ground state of a many - body systems , one might suspect on intuitive grounds that one can describe this ground state with relatively few parameters . more specifically , for one - dimensional systems , one would expect numerical algorithms like the powerful _ density - matrix renormalization group method _",
    "@xcite ( dmrg ) to perform well if the ground state contains a small amount of entanglement .",
    "this suspicion can in fact be made rigorous @xcite as it turns out that the scaling of entanglement specifies how well a given state can be approximated by a matrix - product state @xcite as generated in dmrg .",
    "it is hence not the decay behavior of correlation functions as such that matters here , but in fact the scaling of entanglement . * * topological entanglement entropy : * the topological entanglement entropy is an indicator of _ topological order_,@xcite a new kind of order in quantum many - body systems that can not be described by local order parameters @xcite .",
    "lattice models having a non - vanishing topological entanglement entropy may be seen as lattice instances of topological quantum field theories . here",
    "a global feature is detected by means of the scaling of geometric entropies .    in this colloquium",
    "we do not have sufficient space to give an account of all known derivations of area laws for the entanglement entropy .",
    "however , we will try not to merely remain at a superficial level and only state results , but will explain a number of key techniques and arguments .",
    "when we label main statements as `` theorems '' this is done to highlight their special role , to make it easier to follow the line of reasoning .",
    "for details of arguments and proofs , often technically involved , we refer the reader to the original work .",
    "the reason for the technicality of proofs originates from the type of question that is posed : to distinguish a region of a lattice breaks the translational symmetry of the problem  even in a translationally invariant setting .",
    "while numerical studies are sometimes easier to come by , analytical argument can be technically involved , even for quasi - free models . in this article",
    ", we discuss the study of entanglement entropy primarily ( i ) from the viewpoint of quantum information theory , ( ii ) with an emphasis on rigorous and analytical results , and ( iii ) the implications on the efficiency of numerical simulation .",
    "throughout this article , we will consider quantum many - body systems on a lattice .",
    "such quantum lattice systems are ubiquitous in the condensed matter context @xcite where they play a key role in obtaining an understanding of material properties from a microscopic basis .",
    "lattices systems are also of considerable importance in the study of quantum field theories where a lattice provides a natural ultra - violet cut - off and facilitates numerical simulations of quantum fields @xcite .",
    "one could think , e.g. , of systems of strongly correlated electron systems or lattice vibrations of a crystal lattice . with the advent of research on _ cold atoms _ in optical lattices , quantum lattice systems",
    "can also be prepared in laboratory conditions with an unprecedented degree of control @xcite .",
    "we will consider  at least in parts of this article  general lattices .",
    "each vertex of the _ lattice _ is associated with a quantum system , such as a spin , a bosonic or a fermionic system .",
    "it is convenient to think of this lattice as a simple graph @xmath14 with vertices @xmath0 , and the edge set @xmath15 labeling neighborhood relations .",
    "@xmath16 could be the graph representing a one - dimensional chain with periodic boundary conditions , and in fact a good proportion of this article will deal with such quantum chains . for later purposes",
    ", it will be convenient to think in terms of such a slightly more general picture , however .",
    "the hilbert space of the total many - body system is then the tensor product @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hilbert space associated with the physical system on lattice site @xmath19 .",
    "on such a lattice , one has @xmath20 for @xmath21 as the natural _ graph theoretical distance _ which is the length of the shortest path connecting @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "for a _ cubic lattice _ of dimension @xmath23 with periodic boundary conditions , in turn , @xmath24 where @xmath25 has a compact support @xmath26 , independent of the system size , that is the number of lattice sites denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "the _ boundary surface area _",
    "@xmath28 of a distinguished region @xmath3 of the lattice @xmath0 can be defined in a very natural fashion on such a graph as the cardinality of the set of boundary points @xmath29 so @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "[ areaboebbel ] . throughout the article ,",
    "unless defined specifically otherwise , we will say that the entanglement entropy satisfies an _ area law _ if @xmath30 this means that the entropy of the reduced state @xmath31 scales at most as the boundary area of the region @xmath3 .",
    "before we dive into the details of known results on area laws in quantum many - body systems , let us appreciate how unusual it is for a quantum state to satisfy an area law .",
    "in fact , a quantum state picked at random will exhibit a very different scaling behavior .",
    "if one has a lattice system with @xmath32-dimensional constituents and divides it into a subsystem @xmath1 and the complement @xmath8 , then one may consider the expected entanglement entropy of @xmath3 for the natural choice , the unitarily invariant haar measure .",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath33 >",
    "|i|\\log_2(d)- \\frac{d^{|i|-|o|}}{2 \\log_2(2)}.\\ ] ] that is , asymptotically , the typical entropy of a subsystem is almost maximal , and hence linear in the number of constituents @xmath34 .",
    "hence a `` typical '' quantum state will asymptotically satisfy a volume law , and not an area law . as we will see that area laws are common for ground states of quantum many - body systems",
    ", we find that in this sense , ground states are very non - generic .",
    "this fact is heavily exploited in numerical approaches to study ground states of strongly correlated many - body systems : one does not have to vary over all quantum states in variational approaches , but merely over a much smaller set of states that are good candidates of approximating ground states of local hamiltonians well , that is states that satisfy an area law .",
    "most known results on area laws refer to one - dimensional chains such as _ harmonic _ or _",
    "spin chains_. this emphasis is no surprise : after all , a number of physical ideas  like the jordan - wigner transformation  as well as mathematical methods  such as the theory of toeplitz determinants and fisher - hartwig techniques  are specifically tailored to one - dimensional translationally invariant systems .",
    "if we distinguish a contiguous set of quantum systems of a chain , a _ block _ @xmath35 the boundary of the block consists of only one ( two )",
    "site(s ) for open ( periodic ) boundary conditions .",
    "an area law then clearly means that the entropy is upper bounded by a constant independent of the block size @xmath36 and the lattice size @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath37 we will see that in quantum chains , a very clear picture emerges concerning the scaling of the entanglement entropy . whether an area law holds or not , will largely depend on whether the system is at a _ quantum critical point _ or not .",
    "we will summarize what is known in one - dimensional systems at the end of the detailed discussion of quantum chains , starting with bosonic harmonic chains .",
    "bosonic harmonic quantum systems , as well as fermionic models and their quantum spin chain counterparts like the xy model , play a seminal role in the study of quantum many - body systems . harmonic lattice systems",
    "model discrete versions of klein - gordon fields , vibrational modes of crystal lattices or of trapped ions and serve generally as lowest order approximations to anharmonic systems .",
    "the fact that they are integrable renders even sophisticated questions like the scaling of the geometric entropy in instances amenable to fully analytical study , even in higher spatial dimensions .",
    "in fact , in the latter case these so - called quasi - free models are the only settings that allow for rigorous analytical results so far .",
    "hence , they do form the central object of consideration to explore what should be expected concerning general scaling laws .",
    "the hamiltonian for a harmonic lattice @xmath0 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 are real , symmetric and positive matrices determining the coupling structure of the systems .",
    "the canonical operators @xmath40 satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath41={\\mathrm{i } } \\delta_{j , k}$ ] . in terms of the bosonic annihilation operators @xmath42 the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "ground and thermal states of the above hamiltonian are fully characterized by the second moments of the canonical operators , while first moments vanish @xcite ( entanglement properties of the state are invariant under changes of first moments anyway ) .",
    "the second moments define the _ covariance matrix _",
    "@xmath46 where @xmath47 is the vector of canonical operators .",
    "the covariance matrix of the ground state of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) is given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 , see refs .",
    "@xcite . on the level of covariance matrices unitary operations express themselves as symplectic transformations @xmath51 that preserve the commutation relations @xmath52 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "importantly , _",
    "williamson s theorem _ states that for any strictly positive matrix @xmath54 there exist a symplectic transformation @xmath51 such that @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a diagonal matrix with the same spectrum as the positive square roots of @xmath57 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath58 of @xmath56 are called the _ symplectic eigenvalues _ of @xmath59 .",
    "now , what is the entanglement content of the ground state ? to answer this we need to define entanglement measures and compute them in terms of the properties of the covariance matrix .",
    "the first of these is of course the entropy of entanglement .",
    "williamson s theorem shows that any function of a state that is unitarily invariant is fully determined by the symplectic eigenvalues .",
    "notably , the entropy of a gaussian state @xmath60 with symplectic eigenvalues @xmath61 of the covariance matrix of @xmath60 is given by @xmath62    a key ingredient in the analytical work is another full entanglement measure that was defined in quantum information theory , the _ logarithmic negativity _ @xcite .",

    "the logarithmic negativity has two key features .",
    "mathematically , the importance of @xmath76 is due to @xmath77 which holds for all pure states @xmath60 .",
    "this _ upper bound _ for the entanglement entropy is simpler to compute as one does not have to look at spectra of reductions @xmath31 but of the full system .",
    "this renders a study of area laws possible even in higher dimensional systems .",
    "secondly , in contrast to the entropy of entanglement , the negativity is also an entanglement measure for mixed states , such as thermal states and provides an upper bound on other important measures of mixed state entanglement @xcite .",
    "all of the above holds for general lattices @xmath0 but for the moment we will focus on the one - dimensional setting , that is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is even to allow us to consider the _ symmetrically bisected chain _",
    "@xmath80 with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath81 .",
    "we concentrate on the ground state and discuss thermal states later .",
    "it is worth noting that in higher spatial dimension the natural analog of this setting , the half - space , is of some importance as it allows for a reduction of the problem in question to the 1-d case discussed here @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the scaling behavior of the entanglement of the half - chain has direct consequences on the availability of efficient representations of the state by means of matrix - product states as will be discussed in some detail later on in this article . for a general nearest - neighbor coupling",
    "this means that @xmath26 is the circulant matrix , @xmath82 as a consequence of translational invariance .",
    "@xmath83 specifies the coupling strength , @xmath84 defines the on - site term , @xmath85 , i.e. , positivity demands @xmath86 , and the energy gap above the ground state is given by @xmath87 .",
    "for the logarithmic negativity of the symmetrically bisected half - chain we find @xcite :    [ t1 ] consider a hamiltonian of a harmonic chain on @xmath78 with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath81 , and nearest - neighbor interactions as in eq .",
    ". then the entanglement entropy of the symmetrically bisected chain and the logarithmic negativity satisfy @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the operator norm and @xmath90 .",
    "the quantity @xmath91 will later be related to the speed of sound in the system .",
    "this expression for the block entanglement quantified with respect to the negativity is exact and no approximation .",
    "this was to the knowledge of the authors a first rigorous area law for a lattice system , complementing earlier seminal work for fields @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this expression is entirely independent of @xmath79 , the system size .",
    "the most important observation here is that an area law holds , which can be expressed in terms of the spectral gap in the system : whenever the system is non - critical in the sense that the energy gap @xmath92 satisfies @xmath93 with a system size independent constant @xmath94 , a one - dimensional area law will hold .",
    "the above link of entanglement entropy and spectral gap in the system can be established in much more generality and we will delay this discussion to a later subsection .",
    "the argument leading to theorem [ t1 ] is involved , and for details we refer to ref .",
    "the interesting aspect of this proof is that the spectrum of the half chain can not be obtained analytically , thus not allowing for a direct computation of the entanglement content .",
    "instead , it is the particular combination of spectral values of the partial transpose entering @xmath76 itself that can be explicitly computed .",
    "the proof makes heavy use of the symmetry of the problem , namely the invariance under a flip of the two half chains .",
    "this result suggested that the locality of the interaction in the gapped model is inherited by the locality of entanglement , a picture that was also later confirmed in more generality .",
    "note that the above bound is a particularly tight one , and that it may well suggest what prefactor in terms of the energy gap and speed of sound one might expect in general area laws , as we will discuss later .",
    "let us now consider an important model for which the energy gap vanishes in the thermodynamical limit @xmath95 : taking @xmath96 , @xmath97 , identifying lattice sites by @xmath98 , and the canonical operators by @xmath99 , @xmath100 , one obtains the klein - gordon field hamiltonian @xmath101 in the field limit @xmath95 .",

    "@xcite . ) from the expression ( [ halfent ] ) for the entanglement , we immediately obtain @xmath102 this is a striking difference to the area laws that we have observed earlier , now the entanglement does not saturate but diverges with the length of the half - chain .",
    "the behavior observed here will be mirrored by a similar logarithmic divergence in critical quantum spin chains and fermionic systems .",
    "this will be discussed in the following section .      following the initial work on bosonic models of ref .",
    "@xcite similar questions were explored in fermionic systems and the associated spin models .",
    "the numerical studies in refs .",
    "@xcite presented a significant first step in this direction .",
    "their key observation , later confirmed rigorously @xcite using techniques that we will sketch in this section , is that the scaling of the entanglement entropy as a function of the block size appears to be related to the system being _ quantum critical or not_. again , for a gapped system , away from a quantum critical point , the entanglement entropy would saturate , i.e. , an area law holds . in turn in all cases when the system was critical , the numerical study indicated that the entanglement entropy grows beyond all bounds .",
    "more specifically , it grows logarithmically with the block size .",
    "this behavior is also consistent with the behavior of geometric entropies in conformal field theory @xcite which applies to the critical points of the models discussed in refs .",
    "the intriguing aspect here is that being critical or not is not only reflected by the scaling of expectation values of two - point correlators , but in fact by the ground state entanglement , so genuine quantum correlations .",
    "this section defines the setting , introduces the basic concepts required and outlines the rigorous results in more detail .",

    "this approach was particularly successful in the numerical assessment of the kondo problem , whereas for other problems , results were not quite what was hoped for .",

    "initially , the formulation of dmrg was based on the above renormalization idea .",

    "@xcite relaxed this constraint to demonstrate that a suitable formulation significantly outperforms standard dmrg for periodic boundary conditions in terms of memory requirements .",

    "the functioning of this algorithm can essentially be traced back to the observation that an arbitrarily good approximation to the propagator can be established with polynomial computational resources in the system size @xcite . in time , however , one will eventually encounter typically an exponential increase in the number of degrees of freedom to be kept in order to faithfully describe the state .",
    "this eventually limits the time up to which one can numerically simulate time evolution using a variant of dmrg .",
    "the increase in the entanglement content also eventually limits classical simulations of _ quantum adiabatic algorithms _ based on mps , which nevertheless perform often impressively well ( for a careful numerical analysis , see , e.g. , ref .",

    "we end this subsection with a note rather from the computer science than from the physics perspective : the fact that a true ground state is well - approximated by an mps does , strictly speaking , not necessarily mean that dmrg will also efficiently _ find _ this best approximation . in practice ,",

    "the ultimate reason for this impressive performance is yet to be ultimately understood .",

    "even more strongly put , the problem of approximating the ground state energy of a system composed of a chain of quantum systems is _ qma - complete _ @xcite .",
    "this should be seen as a warning sign : the functioning of variational algorithms such as dmrg is essentially based on heuristics , and in worst case one can encounter hard problems .",
    "the energy landscape is then so rugged that one gets stuck in local optima .",

    "a rigorous result similar to theorem [ ap ] , yet , is still lacking for peps or mera .",
    "the intuition developed so far , however , is in one way or the other quite certainly right : whenever an area law is satisfied , peps with small bond dimension should give rise to a reasonably good approximation .",

    "as has been pointed out above , this research field is presently enjoying a lot of attention , for a number of reasons and motivations . yet , needless to say , there are numerous open questions that are to be studied , of which we mention a few to highlight further perspectives :    * can one prove that gapped higher - dimensional general local lattice models always satisfy an area law ? * in higher dimensional systems , critical systems can both satisfy and violate an area law .",
    "what are further conditions to ensure that critical systems satisfy an area law ? what is the exact role of the fermi surface in the study of area laws in fermionic critical models ?",
    "* can one compute scaling laws for the mutual information for quasi - free systems ? * for what 1-d models beyond quasi - free and conformal settings can one find rigorous expressions for the entanglement entropy ?",
    "* under what precise conditions do quenched disordered local models lead to having `` less entanglement '' ?",
    "* what are the further perspectives of using conformal methods for systems with more than one spatial dimension ?",
    "* can the link between the bekenstein formula in the ads context and the scaling of geometric entropies in conformal field theories be sharpened ? * to what extent is having a positive topological entropy and encountering topological order one to one ? * how can the relationship between satisfying an area law and the efficient approximation of ground states with peps be rigorously established ?",
    "* what efficiently describable states satisfy an area law , such that one can still efficiently compute local properties ?",
    "* are there further instances for 1-d systems satisfying an area law that allow for certifiable approximations in terms of matrix - product states ?",
    "these questions only touch upon the various perspectives that open up in this context .",
    "the quantitative study of a research area that could be called `` hamiltonian complexity '' is just beginning to emerge .",
    "the puzzle of how complex quantum many - body systems are , and how many effective degrees of freedom are exploited by nature , is still one of the intriguing topics in the study of interacting quantum systems .",

    "<S> center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed , area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation in quantum lattice models , and disordered systems , non - equilibrium situations , and topological entanglement entropies are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> these questions are considered in classical and quantum systems , in their ground and thermal states , for a variety of correlation measures . </S>",
    "<S> a significant proportion of the article is devoted to the clear and quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss matrix - product states , higher - dimensional analogues , and variational sets from entanglement renormalization and conclude by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations of quantum states . </S>"
