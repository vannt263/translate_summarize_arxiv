    "the first example of a pure state describing the coexistence of phases separated by an interface was discovered by r. dobrushin in 1972 , @xcite .",
    "there he was studying the low temperature 3d ising model .",
    "he was considering the ising spins in a cubic box @xmath0 with @xmath1__-boundary condition _ _ @xmath2 : all spins of @xmath2 are @xmath3 in the upper half - space and @xmath4 @xmath5 in the lower half - space .",
    "such a boundary condition forces an interface @xmath6 into @xmath7 separating the @xmath3-phase from the @xmath8-phase .",
    "dobrushin has shown that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath9 the distribution of @xmath6 goes to a proper limit ( in contrast with the 2d case ) .",
    "this limit describes the behavior of the surface separating the @xmath3- and the @xmath4-phases .",
    "his method of analysis was what is now called the cluster expansion , based on pirogov - sinai contour functional theory .",
    "later on , this approach was applied to other discrete models in @xcite .",
    "the question of coexistence of phases for systems with continuous symmetry was addressed in @xcite .",
    "it was found there that the analogous states for the @xmath10-model do not exist , and that the surface tension between two magnetized phases vanishes .",
    "other systems were not studied in the literature .",
    "there are probably two reasons for that :    1 .",
    "most systems with continuous symmetry do not display the above ising - type rigid interface separating different phases , 2 .   the pirogov - sinai theory ( ps ) does not work  for continuous symmetry systems , while the ( only ) alternative method  the reflection positivity ( rp )",
    " works just for periodic boundary conditions , and therefore one can not handle boundary conditions of the type @xmath2 needed in order to create the interface .    in order to illustrate the first point , let us consider the low - temperature 3d classical @xmath10 model , defined by the hamiltonian@xmath11 where the spins @xmath12 are taking values on the circle @xmath13 as was established in the seminal paper @xcite , this model has a continuum of low - temperature magnetized phases , @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "one can try to create a state of coexistence of two phases by using the @xmath1-boundary condition _",
    "_ @xmath16 which assigns the value @xmath17 to spins in the upper half - space and the value @xmath18 in the lower half - space .",
    "however , as the comparison with the gaussian case shows , one expects the thermodynamic limit of that state to be the mixture state , @xmath19 with no interface emerging .",
    "the @xmath20 model is defined by the same hamiltonian @xmath21 but the variables @xmath22-s are taking values on the sphere @xmath23 and the difference @xmath24 is just the angle between @xmath25 and @xmath26 let @xmath27 be the euler angles  coordinates on @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30   .$ ] again , at low temperatures there are extremal gibbs states @xmath31 @xmath32 the @xmath33-boundary condition @xmath34 is now the configuration assigning the value @xmath35 ( north pole ) to the upper half - space , and @xmath36 ( south pole ) to the lower half - space .",
    "we expect that the corresponding finite - volume state @xmath37 converges weakly , as @xmath38 to the mixture @xmath39    still , we believe that dobrushin states for some systems with continuous symmetry do exist .",
    "one likely example is the so - called non - linear sigma - model , considered recently in @xcite .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by@xmath40 with @xmath41 for @xmath42 large enough ",
    "i.e. when the potential well is narrow enough  this model exhibits the following behavior : at high temperatures it has unique gibbs state ( the chaotic state ) . at low temperatures in 2d",
    "it presumably has the kosterlitz - thouless phase with power - law correlation decay , which can be obtained by the methods of the paper @xcite . at low temperatures in 3d",
    "it should have infinitely many ordered gibbs states , indexed by magnetization , as the results of @xcite suggest . moreover",
    " and that is the main result of @xcite  there exists a critical temperature @xmath43 at which we have the coexistence of the chaotic state and the ordered state(s ) .",
    "( of course , all these states are translation - invariant . )",
    "the results of @xcite are valid in any dimension @xmath44 we believe that in dimension @xmath45 at the critical temperature @xmath46 the system possesses also non - translation - invariant states , describing the coexistence of ordered states and chaotic state , with the rigid interface separating them .",
    "the present paper was started as an attempt to prove the above conjecture .",
    "unfortunately , we are currently unable to complete this program .",
    "( our partial results in this direction are briefly described at the end of this introduction . )",
    "however , we are able to study the interfaces in some discrete approximations of the non - linear sigma - model and other models of this type . by discrete approximation",
    "we mean here the following .",
    "let @xmath47 be the hamiltonian for the continuous spin model , @xmath48 with free measure @xmath49 then its discrete approximation is given by the hamiltonian @xmath50 with @xmath51 where the group @xmath52 is equipped with counting measure .",
    "the integer @xmath53 is the parameter of the approximation .",
    "( one can call the resulting model as _ the _ _ clock - model , _ corresponding to the interaction @xmath54 )    if the function @xmath55 has unique nondegenerate minimum on @xmath56 then the resulting @xmath52-model at low temperatures is potts - like , and thus has properties quite different from the continuous symmetry system .",
    "the situation becomes much more interesting if the _ minimum of _ @xmath55 _ is degenerate _ and , moreover , the _ minimal value is attained along a ( small ) segment _ , while the discretization parameter @xmath53 is large .",
    "then the properties of such a system are quite similar to the one with continuous symmetry . unlike the potts model ,",
    "the ground states of our hamiltonian @xmath57 are infinitely degenerate .",
    "we believe that in the 3d case at low temperatures ( as well as at zero temperature ) such a model exhibits spontaneous magnetization , while the truncated correlations decay as a power law .",
    "hopefully one can establish this conjectured behavior by a suitable version of the infrared bounds . in the 2d case",
    "we believe that mermin - wagner  theorem holds , so that the magnetization is zero , even at zero temperature .",
    "we expect the correlation decay to be a power law .",
    "our 2d conjecture at zero temperature is close in spirit to the results of r. kenyon @xcite on 2d tilings , while for positive low temperatures its behavior looks to us to be similar to that of the intermediate phase of the classical clock - model , established in @xcite .",
    "another model with similar features was considered by m. aizenman , @xcite .",
    "the methods of the cited papers @xcite can be easily adapted to prove that in dimension @xmath58 the structure of the phase diagram for the hamiltonian @xmath57 , with the function @xmath59 having deep and @xmath60-narrow well ( possibly with a flat bottom ) and @xmath53 large enough , has the same features as for the very  non - linear sigma - model : at high temperatures it has unique gibbs state , while at low temperatures it has ( one or more ) gibbs states with local order , which means that the probability of seeing the discrepancy : @xmath61 at two n.n .",
    "sites is small .",
    "moreover , there exists a temperature @xmath62 at which the high - t chaotic state coexists with the low - t locally - ordered state(s ) .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the rigidity property of the chaos / order interface once the dimension @xmath63 is at least @xmath64 namely , we show that if the two phases are put into coexistence at the transition temperature @xmath65 by applying suitable boundary conditions in a given volume , then the interface between them is rigid , and its height function exhibits the long - range order . since the proof of this result is quite involved , we will establish it in the present paper only for the simplest model of the above type , defined below , @xmath66    we will now comment on the method we use to study our problem . presently there are two techniques to study phase transitions : the pirogov - sinai theory and the method of reflection positivity .",
    "it seems unlikely that our model can be treated by ps - theory , since we have here infinite degeneracy of the ground states and we expect power - law decay of correlations .",
    "on the other hand , the applications of the rp method rely on the study of the states with periodic boundary conditions . in the phase coexistence regime",
    "such a state is not ergodic , and its ergodic decomposition allows one to study various pure states  but only _ _ some states,__since the non - translation - invariant states do not contribute to the state with periodic boundary conditions .    notwithstanding",
    "the above discussion , our method of proof will be that of reflection positivity .",
    "but in order to study the chaos / order interface , we will use rp not with periodic boundary conditions , but with mixed ones ; namely , we impose periodic boundary conditions only in two ( horizontal ) dimensions , and we leave the third ( vertical ) dimension free  to impose fixed spins boundary conditions in the third dimension . in other words ,",
    "we consider the cylindric boundary conditions topology , @xmath67   , $ ] and we impose ordered boundary conditions on the top of the cylinder and chaotic boundary conditions on its bottom .",
    "of course , the resulting state will be rp only with respect to reflections in vertical planes , but that will be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "this restricted reflection positivity is the main technical innovation of this paper .",
    "* our main result * will be that the so constructed state at @xmath68 necessarily possesses an interface , separating the ordered and the disordered phases , which interface is rigid in the sense of @xcite : it has a well - defined ( random ) global height , while the deviations from it happen at any given location with a small probability .    one usual advantage of rp method and the chess - board estimates is that their technical implementations are usually quite simple , as compared with the pirogov - sinai theory .",
    "in this respect we have to note that the _ restricted _ rp is already more involved technically and requires a detailed study of various spatially extended defects , not present in the usual applications of rp .",
    "our technique enables one to study also the continuous symmetry case , and to obtain similar results in a 3d slab @xmath69 : $ ] with order - disorder boundary conditions and for a suitable narrow - well interaction @xmath55 one has the chaos / order rigid interface at the critical temperature @xmath70 however , the technical limitations of our approach are such that the width @xmath60 of the potential well depends on the width @xmath71 of the slab , with @xmath72 as @xmath73 therefore , in contrast to the discrete symmetry case , we can not take the full thermodynamic limit @xmath74 @xmath73 the details will be published separately , see @xcite .",
    "* other models . *",
    "finally we remark that our technique , applied to the 3d ising or potts models , allows one to obtain simpler proofs of the rigidity of their interfaces .",
    "indeed , since in these models the ground states are non - degenerate , our machinery simplifies a lot , and the resulting proofs are relatively short .",
    "we can also treat various 3d real valued random fields .",
    "for example , we can study the double - well case , defined by the hamiltonian@xmath75 we can show that at low temperatures this system possesses rigid interface separating the plus - phase , where @xmath76 from the minus - phase , where @xmath77 another case of interest is the model with extra local minimum of the energy , considered in @xcite , where @xmath78 here the potential @xmath79 has a ( unique ) global minimum , which is narrow , and an additional local one , which has to be relatively wide . then , as it is shown in @xcite , such a model undergoes a phase transition at some temperature @xmath80 at which temperature one has a coexistence of the low - energy phase , corresponding to the global minimum , with high entropy phase , corresponding to the local minimum . in dimension 3",
    "we can show that at this temperature this model exhibits rigid interface separating the above two phases .",
    "we want to stress that the above stated results for the models @xmath81 and @xmath82 are technically simpler than the corresponding statements for the system @xmath57 and its discrete versions . indeed , while in the models @xmath83 and @xmath82 one has exponential decay of correlation due to the positive mass of the potential wells , in @xmath84 and its discrete version we expect power law decay .",
    "this is why in the present paper we concentrate on the last model .",
    "the corresponding results for @xmath85 and @xmath86 will be published separately , @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following :    the next section contains the definition of the model we study and the formulation of the main result .",
    "section 3 contains the main steps of the proof .",
    "we introduce there the gas of defects of the interface , and we use reflection positivity and the chess - board estimates to reduce the study of the local defects to the study of defect sheets . some defects do not contribute to the weight of the interface , so to control these we have to glue them in pairs by means of the gluing transformation .",
    "the sections 4 and 5 contain the needed combinatorial - energy properties of various defect sheets .",
    "the last section 6 contains the final steps of the proof of our main result .",
    "in what follows we will consider the 3d lattice model with spins @xmath87 taking values in the additive group @xmath88 we will equip @xmath52 with the counting measure .",
    "let @xmath89 be a configuration of our model .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system is given by @xmath90 where the summation goes over nearest neighbors .",
    "clearly , the interaction and the hamiltonian are @xmath52-invariant .",
    "( in terms of section 1 , the hamiltonian @xmath91 corresponds to the model @xmath84 with interaction having a well of width @xmath92 )    let us define the notion of order :    [ ordered bonds]a bond @xmath93 of our lattice @xmath94 is called ordered in @xmath95 iff @xmath96 .",
    "otherwise it is called disordered .    using a technique similar to @xcite",
    ", one can show that for @xmath53 large enough the above model undergoes a first - order phase transition in temperature .",
    "namely , the following theorem holds :    there exists a temperature @xmath97 at which the hamiltonian @xmath91 has at least two gibbs states : the ordered state @xmath98 and the disordered state @xmath99 they are characterized by the properties : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is any bond of @xmath102 while @xmath103 goes to zero as @xmath104 ( incidentally , the critical temperature @xmath65 goes to zero as @xmath105 . )    note .",
    "we believe that in 3d the state @xmath106is not pure , and is a mixture of @xmath53 states with different values of magnetization .",
    "the purpose of our work is the study of the interface between the ordered and disordered phases of the hamiltonian @xmath91 at the critical temperature @xmath65 , put into coexistence by suitable boundary conditions .",
    "the construction of the corresponding non - translation - invariant states will be discussed in another publication , @xcite .    to study the interfaces we will consider special boxes and we will impose special boundary conditions , which will force the interface into the box .",

    "we merge them into a single defect : we will consider the connected components of the family @xmath250 , and by a slight abuse of terminology we still call the resulting segments defects ( or extended defects ) .",
    "the sign of the merger is defined to be the sum of the constituents .",
    "now any two defects have no cubes in common ( though they can share a facet ) . from now on we will deal exclusively with extended defects , so in what follows we will omit the symbol @xmath247 and will write just @xmath237 for the extended defects .",
    "we also _ fix the nature of every bond in the defect _",
    ", i.e. whether the bond is ordered or disordered .    [ problematic defects][probl ] among the defects we single out those with the property that every bond not belonging to the two end - cubes is disordered .",
    "( note that at least one of these end - cubes has then to be ordered . )",
    "if this defect is signed , it was built from a blob consisting of just one horizontal plaquette ; if it is not signed , it was built from the coagulation of two consecutive signed blobs , both consisting of just one horizontal plaquette . in both cases",
    "these defects will be called _ problematic . _ if both end - cubes of a problematic defect are ordered , the defect consists of 5 cubes , 3 of which are pure ; if only one end - cube is ordered , the defect consists of 3 cubes , 2 of which are pure .    other defects , which will be called exceptional problematic defects , appear among defects attached to the bottom ( disordered ) boundary . such a defect is called e - problematic , if it has the following three properties :    \\1 .",

    "we will show in the section [ np ] that the replacement of it by one of the two following narrower defect sheets:@xmath380 or@xmath381 leads to the increase of the probability .",
    "which of the last two patterns gives the increase needed depends on the temperature ; in the high temperature region the first scenario ( the advance of disorder ) wins over the frustration strip , while at low temperatures the second one takes over the frustration .",
    "moreover  and that is of crucial importance  the two temperature regions are intersecting , and at the common temperature each of the two scenarios gets a higher probability than the thick frustration sheet .",
    "note also , that the frustration sheet can not disappear completely : in every column there should be at least one frustrated cube between the ordered and the disordered phase , which is the reason for the problematic defects to be treated separately .    in more details",
    ", our strategy will be the following : we consider all signed defects in the column @xmath198 , which from now on will have their special notation : @xmath382 note that we always have an odd number of them ; moreover , their signs alternate , with @xmath383",
    ". some of @xmath384-s can be problematic .",
    "the remaining neutral defects will be denoted by @xmath385 ; some of them can also be problematic .",
    "we pair signed defects as follows : @xmath386 while neutral defects are paired in the following way : @xmath387 if @xmath388 is odd , we finally pair the remaining neutral defect @xmath389 with @xmath390 ; if @xmath388 is even , the defect @xmath390 is left unpaired .",
    "notice that the two paired signed defects have the same sign .",
    "note also that for a non - trivial pattern it can not happen that we have just one defect of problematic or e - problematic type",
    ".    the above pairing will be essential for us only when both defects in the pair are problematic ",
    "i.e. when we have a _ problematic pair_. in that case we will treat them together via gluing construction , explained below .",
    "the pairing of the remaining defects is inessential , since each pair contains at least one non - problematic defect , so we can distribute the cost of the latter over the pair . in particular , if both are non - problematic , we will just add the two separate contributions .      in this section we will construct for every layered event @xmath391 another layered event , @xmath392 of a similar type .",
    "the new event will have less frustrated layers , and , what is most important , it will have no problematic pairs of defects .",
    "more precisely , we prove the following :    for any event @xmath202 with @xmath388 problematic pairs one can construct the event @xmath393 such that :    1 .   @xmath394 2 .",
    "all defects of @xmath395 can be paired in such a way that no pair is problematic , 3 .",
    "the number of frustrated layers in @xmath396 is @xmath397 .",

    "we consider first the case when the two defects paired are problematic ( or e - problematic ) signed defects @xmath384 and @xmath398 , with @xmath399 .",
    "we assume that the sign of @xmath384 ( and therefore of @xmath398 ) is minus ; the plus case is even simpler , since both defects are then non - exceptional problematic defects .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath398 consists of a sequence of 3 cubes : in ascending order we first meet one pure disordered cube , then one frustrated , followed by one pure ordered cube .",
