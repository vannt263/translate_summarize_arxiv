    "after decades of trying , the search for solar - type oscillations in stars finally appears to have been successful ( see , e.g. , bouchy & carrier 2001 and carrier et al .",
    "although this led gough ( 2001 ) to announce the `` birth of asteroseismology '' , for the past two decades asteroseismology has successfully investigated the interiors of many types of stars other than the solar - type stars .",
    "remarkable success stories of observational and theoretical investigations of white dwarf stars and rapidly oscillating ap stars have amply demonstrated the power of asteroseismology as a tool to advance our knowledge of the physics of stellar interiors and the details of stellar evolution ( see , e.g. , kurtz et al 1989 ; winget et al . 1991 ; kawaler & bradley 1994 ; matthews et al . 1999 ) .    with these successes , some mysteries have remained . in this letter , we address apparently contradictory interpretations of the pulsation spectrum of the rapidly oscillating ap star hr1217 .",
    "this star , discovered to be a pulsator by kurtz ( 1982 ) , was investigated with an extensive global campaign in 1986 ( kurtz et al .",
    "1989 ) . a key result from that data set was a list of six principal pulsation frequencies , reproduced in table 1 . as expected from the asymptotic theory of nonradial pulsations , five of the modes are nearly equally spaced in frequency .",
    "the asymptotic frequency spacing , @xmath2 , is a measure of the sound crossing time of the star , which in turn is determined by the star s mean density and radius . with a typical mass of ap stars of about 2m@xmath3 , @xmath2 reflects the radius of the star , with @xmath2 scaling as @xmath4 .",
    "in the asymptotic limit , the number of nodes in the radial direction , @xmath5 , is larger than the spherical degree @xmath6 .",
    "assuming adiabatic pulsations",
    "in spherically symmetric stars the pulsation frequencies are , to first order , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a ( small ) constant ( tassoul 1980 , 1990 ) . without precise identification of the degree ( @xmath6 ) of the pulsation modes , asymptotic theory allows the frequency spacing to be uncertain by a factor of two , depending on whether modes of alternating even and odd @xmath6 are present ( producing modes separated by @xmath9 in frequency ) , or only modes of consecutive @xmath5 .",
    "the results of the 1986 campaign were inconclusive as to whether @xmath2 was 68@xmath0hz or 34@xmath0hz .",
    "the prinicipal frequencies seen in the data are given in table 1 ; they correspond to those found by kurtz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for the 15 day stretch of best coverage ( for comparison with the new data presented in table 3 ) .",
    "the highest frequency of hr1217 in those data was 50@xmath0hz higher than the fifth mode , suggesting that @xmath2 was 34@xmath0hz .",
    "but the fine structure of the spacings was suggestive of alternating @xmath6 values .",
    "fortunately , the two possible values could be assessed if the luminosity of the star were precisely known .",
    "if @xmath2 were 34@xmath0hz , then the radius of hr1217 would be large enough that it would be far removed from the main sequence ( i.e. more evolved ) and therefore more luminous ( heller & kawaler 1988 ) .",
    "matthews et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used the hipparcos parallax measurement to place hr1217 unambiguously close to the main sequence  meaning that @xmath2 is indeed 68@xmath0hz .",
    "this deepened the `` mystery of the sixth frequency '' , now @xmath10 higher .",
    "no clear theoretical construct could explain it .",
    "the asymptotic frequency spacing given in the equation above is valid only for linear adiabatic pulsations in spherically symmetric stars .",
    "however , the magnetic field , the chemical inhomogeneities , and rotation all contribute to break the spherical symmetry in roap stars .",
    "therefore , it is important to know the effects that these deviations from spherical symmetry have on the theoretical amplitude spectra of roap stars , before comparing the latter with the observed amplitude spectra .",
    "the effects of the chemical inhomogeneities have been discussed recently by balmforth et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but those will not concern us further here .",
    "the effects of the magnetic field on the oscillations of roap stars ( dziembowski & goode 1996 ; bigot et al .",
    "2000 ; cunha & gough 2000 ) , as well as the conjoined effect of rotation and magnetic field ( bigot 2002 ) , have been determined by means of a singular perturbation approach .",
    "while generally the magnetic field effect on the oscillations is expected to be small , cunha & gough ( 2000 ) found that , at the frequencies of maximal magnetoacoustic coupling , the latter is expected to become significantly large , resulting in an abrupt drop of the separation between mode frequencies .",
    "the observational consequence of the results of cunha & gough ( 2000 ) suggests that we should see equally spaced modes in roap stars , with an occasional mode much closer to its lower frequency counterparts .",
    "more recently , cunha ( 2001 ) suggested that the explanation of the strange separation between the last two modes observed in hr1217 could rest on the occasional abrupt decrease of the large separations predicted by cunha & gough ( 2000 ) .",
    "for this prediction to hold , she argued that the observations of kurtz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) must have missed detecting a mode at a frequency 34@xmath0hz higher than that of the fifth mode they observed .",
    "she predicted that new , more precise measurements would find this `` missing mode '' if the alfvnic losses were not large enough to stabilise it .",
    "detailed re  examination of the data from 1986 shows no peak at the key position approximately 33 @xmath0hz above f5 at the 0.1  mma level .",
    ".principal frequencies in hr1217 ( data from kurtz et al .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in 2000 november , we began an extensive , coordinated global photometry campaign on hr1217 using the whole earth telescope .",
    "a complete analysis of this extensive data set , which addresses many other aspects of roap stars , is in preparation . in this letter",
    ", we present a preliminary analysis of data from that run that clearly shows a previously unseen pulsation mode at a frequency about 36@xmath0hz above the fifth frequency , as predicted by cunha ( 2001 ) . in the next section",
    ", we describe the observational procedures and the data coverage and reduction .",
    "section 3 presents the preliminary frequency analysis , and the results are discussed in section 4 , along with a brief discussion of the impact of this result on the theory of pulsations of roap stars .",
    "the wet run on hr1217 began on 2000 november 6 at selected sites , and continued through early 2000 december .",
    "the bulk of the data , with the best global coverage , were obtained during 2000 november 14 - 30 .",
    "a complete analysis of all of the available data is currently underway . for this letter , we concentrate on the central portion of the wet run , with data from five sites .",
    "this subset of the full data set provides high signal  to  noise and a reasonable global coverage .",
    "it also extends over slightly more than one rotation cycle of hr1217 .",
    "since the pulsation amplitude is modulated with the rotation period , this data subset is just long enough to begin to resolve rotational sidelobes of the main peaks .",
    "table 2 lists the individual observing runs in this data set .",
    "the telescopes used range in aperture from 0.6 m to 2.1 m .",
    "data from all sites were obtained using photoelectric photometers , with 10s individual integrations . at beijing astronomical observatory , mcdonald observatory , mauna kea observatory , and observatorio del teide ,",
    "the observers used three - channel photometers that are functionally similar to the equipment described in kleinman et al .",
    "the south african astronomical observatory observations were made with a single - channel photometer , and the observations at ctio with a two  channel photometer . at all sites , observations were made through a johnson @xmath11 filter , along with neutral density filters when needed to keep the count rates below @xmath12s@xmath13 .",
    "following the procedures described in kleinman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the sky background was continuously monitored with the three - channel instruments . at sites using two - channel and single channel photometers ,",
    "the sky was obtained several times during the night at irregular intervals , and then interpolated during reduction .",

    "early in the run , it became clear that hr1217 was pulsating with the same frequencies that were present in the 1986 data analysed by kurtz et al .",

    "the chief difference between the 2000 data and 1986 data is the presence of a frequency at 2791 @xmath0hz listed as f6 in table 3 .",
    "that mode was not detected in the data of kurtz et al .",
    "( 1989 - table 1 ) but was a clear signal in the wet xcov20 2000 data . to ensure that this frequency is not an artefact of the data reduction algorithm",
    ", we repeated the frequency analysis of our data fitting just the large - amplitude peaks f2 , f3 , f4 , and f5 , and their rotational sidelobes ( if present ) .",
    "we then removed those 10 frequencies .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . this figure shows the original ft , and the ft of the data simulated by including f2-f5 and their rotational sidelobes .",
    "clearly , there is excess signal at the positions of f1 and f7 , but also at 2791  @xmath0hz as well .",
    "thus we conclude that the `` new '' frequency , f6 , is real .",
    "table 3 shows that it lies at nearly @xmath9 above f5 , as expected if it is a normal @xmath20mode and @xmath21hz .",
    "it is much closer to f7 than @xmath9 , as predicted by cunha ( 2001 ) .",
    "cunha ( 2001 ) speculated that the position of the f7 peak in the kurtz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) data is consistent with her model of the normal mode structure in ap stars when magnetic fields are important to the pulsation dynamics .",
    "since that peak was @xmath10 above f5 ( which is inexplicable in asymptotic theory ) , she suggested that there should be a peak at @xmath9 above f5 .",
    "that is precisely what we see in the data from the wet run in november 2000 with the discovery of f6 .    as discussed earlier ,",
    "other explanations for the frequency spacing pattern from f5 to f7 are in direct conflict with the now well - determined hipparcos luminosity of hr1217 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the frequency pattern in hr1217 suggests that the pulsations we see in this star are consistent with normal @xmath20mode pulsations whose frequencies are , in some cases , strongly affected by the magnetic field of the star .",
    "cunha ( 2001 ) suggested that large alfvnic losses could help explain the missing f6 in the 1986 data , as these losses are maximal at the frequencies where the large separations experience the abrupt decrease .",
    "this energy loss could either stabilize the mode or contribute to decrease its amplitude ( although it is not clear how the growth rates relate to the amplitude of the modes in roap stars ) .",
    "since f6 is observed in the present data , the possibility that the alfvnic losses are large enough to stabilise this mode can be ruled out , at least at the time of these observations . whether at the time of the previous observations the efficacy of the magnetoacoustic coupling ( which depends , among other things , on the exact frequency of the mode and on the characteristics of the magnetic field ) was different , is something to which we do not have an answer . an attempt to monitor the amplitude of f6 , as well as that of the other modes , in the future",
    "might , therefore , be worthwhile .",
    "however , the magnetic field does produce an important observable effect on the frequency of f7 .    with the detection of f6 , we move closer to a detailed understanding of the pulsation mechanism in roap stars .",
    "most intriguingly , this result for hr1217 suggests that , with appropriately detailed models , we may soon be able to probe the magnetic field structure below the surfaces of these stars through their pulsation frequencies  another application of asteroseismology to probing stellar interiors .",
