    "while qcd has been unequivocally established as the theory of strong interactions , the resolution of one of its mysteries , the @xmath1 problem , has remained somewhat unsatisfying .",
    "the @xmath1 problem is that the lagrangian of qcd @xmath2 has , in the massless limit , a global chiral @xmath3 symmetry , under which @xmath4 , which does not seem to be reflected in the spectrum of light pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the formation of quark condensates @xmath5 spontaneously beaks the @xmath6 symmetry of massless qcd down to a diagonal @xmath7 , which should result in nine pseudoscalar pseudogoldstone bosons .",
    "the problem is that , with masses included , chiral perturbation theory unambiguously predicts a neutral pseudoscalar meson whose mass is strictly less than @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "however , the true hadron spectrum contains only the regular @xmath9 ( 140 ) , the @xmath10 ( 549 ) , and the @xmath11(957 ) , so the chiral perturbation theory bound is clearly violated .",
    "actually , the @xmath1 problem is little more subtle ; the @xmath3 is anomalous , _",
    "i.e. _ broken by quantum effects .",
    "mathematically , while the qcd lagrangian is invariant ( except for the mass terms ) , the functional measure in the path integral is not , and so a chiral rotation results in @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the simplest solution of the @xmath14 problem is then to say that the @xmath15 symmetry is not really a symmetry at all , so there should be no corresponding pseudogoldstone boson  @xcite . however , from the qcd side it is hard to see how the new term in could make any difference .",
    "because it is a total derivative , any feynman diagram involving the anomaly carries a factor of zero for total momentum .",
    "thus , the new term does not contribute at any order in perturbation theory , and therefore the solution must be non - perturbative .",
    "if we accept that @xmath15 is not a symmetry , the pseudoscalar sector can be modeled in the chiral lagrangian  @xcite . in full generality",
    ", the chiral lagrangian has five free parameters , corresponding to a scale for the @xmath14 breaking , and four decay constants characterizing the interaction strength between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons and the @xmath16 and @xmath17 currents  @xcite .",
    "the number of parameters can be reduced , for example by going to the large @xmath18 limit , but a few parameters at least remain . in particular ,",
    "none of the assumptions allow a first - principles calculation of the @xmath11 mass .",
    "the first convincing resolution of the @xmath14 problem was given by t hooft  @xcite , who argued topological instanton configurations of the qcd vector potential can contribute to the path integral through the anomaly .",
    "the instanton contributions are suppressed by factors of @xmath19 , which can be significant only for large @xmath20 , _ i.e. _ when qcd enters the non - perturbative regime .",
    "however , instanton calculations generically have infrared divergences , due to integrals over large instanton size , so it is impossible to use them for precise quantitative calculations .",
    "nevertheless , they seem to be the correct qualitative solution . and , for example , using qcd sum rules  @xcite",
    ", they can be used to get a ballpark estimate of the @xmath11 mass ( @xmath21 gev ) .",
    "other non - perturbative insights into the @xmath14 problem have come from the lattice  @xcite .",
    "because the @xmath11 is critically sensitive to both quark loops and non - local field configurations , it has been a challenge to simulate .",
    "nevertheless , the lattice has been remarkably successful in this case , and a recent estimate  @xcite puts the @xmath11 at @xmath22 mev , which is within 10% of the experimental value .",
    "this is absolute confirmation that qcd itself solves the @xmath14 problem .",
    "but it is hard to get any qualitative understanding from such a purely numerical approach .    in this paper , we propose that the pseudoscalar mesons can be studied both qualitatively and quantitatively with a non - perturbative framework based on the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "this framework has already produced an impressive post - diction of the meson spectrum , decay constants , and couplings  @xcite .",
    "it has also led to some new insights into observations about qcd , such as vector meson dominance  @xcite , and the structure of tensor mesons  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask whether it can say anything about the @xmath14 mystery of qcd .",
    "the approach to ads / qcd we take in this paper is completely bottom up .",
    "although the ads / cft correspondence began strictly as a duality between a four - dimensional conformal gauge theory and a 10-dimensional string theory , it is difficult to make any quantitative predictions about qcd from the string side .",
    "early work , studying for example , the glueball spectrum of a large-@xmath23 theory  @xcite , had some success when compared to lattice results ; but to study real world qcd , with three flavors and massive quarks , we would need much more information about the string dual of qcd than is currently known ( see , for example  @xcite ) .",
    "instead , we assume that whatever the string theory is , it must contain bulk modes dual to the various local operators of qcd . to reproduce the conformal behavior of the asymptotically free regime of qcd",
    ", these modes will propagate on a background close to anti - desitter space .",
    "it turns out this is enough information to reproduce a number of non - trivial quantitative predictions about qcd at low energy .",
    "the setup is a five - dimensional space , with background metric @xmath24 in pure ads the warp factor is @xmath25 , but we will allow for background corrections due to deviations from conformality",
    ". the extra dimension can be thought of as energy , with small @xmath26 representing high energy .",
    "thus we model the ir , where qcd is strong , by boundary conditions at a point @xmath27 .",
    "we also impose boundary conditions at @xmath28 , high energy , where qcd approaches a trivial conformal fixed point .",
    "thus the gravity background is modeling energies between @xmath29 and infinity .",
    "for this 5-d description to be equivalent to qcd , it should reproduce qcd correlation functions of external currents .",
    "these appear as probes in the uv . for each qcd operator which couples the vacuum to these currents",
    ", there must be a corresponding field in 5d which also couples to the current . more generally ,",
    "for each operator in qcd , there should be a 5d field . in our case ,",
    "the currents of interest are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the right- and left - handed @xmath32 currents .",
    "the corresponding fields are bulk gauge fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the operator @xmath35 which spontaneously breaks @xmath36 is represented by bifundamental bulk scalars @xmath37 . the fields x@xmath38 have interactions and a potential",
    ". however , this potential is neither calculable nor relevant to low energy , so we simply parameterize this potential and fit to data .",
    "to study the @xmath14 problem , we now introduce a new complex field @xmath39 to represent the square of the gluon field strength : @xmath40 .",
    "we can think of the phase of @xmath39 as dual to @xmath41 .",
    "we emphasize that identifying @xmath39 is not important for the low energy physics , we only use it to manifest a linear representation of the symmetries . thus our 5d lagrangian , including all terms allowed by symmetry , is @xmath42 \\right\\ } \\label{linearsig}\\ ] ] that @xmath43 gets a 5d mass but @xmath39 does not follows form the ads / cft map between masses and dimensions of operators . with these masses ,",
    "the solutions to the equations of motion for @xmath43 and @xmath39 in pure @xmath44 are @xmath45 these must correspond to the vacuum expectation values , @xmath46 and @xmath47 and to the sources @xmath48 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus the @xmath26-dependence of a field is seen to match the scaling dimension of the corresponding operator . in the 3-flavor case , for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that @xmath49 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath50 and use only two masses @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    to study this theory , we will explore the pseudoscalar excitations around the @xmath43 and @xmath39 backgrounds .",
    "@xmath53 there are of course scalar excitations as well , but these are harder to study as they are sensitive to details of the @xmath43 and @xmath39 effective potentials . for the left and right @xmath32 gauge fields , we will only need the axial combination @xmath54 .",
    "the longitudinal modes of @xmath55 mix with the pions , so it is helpful to include them explicitly with the replacement @xmath56",

    "we have also dropped @xmath67 , as it is will be a subleading power correction in everything that follows . regardless of these conventions",
    ", it is simplest to regard eq .  , instead of eq .",
    ", as the starting point for phenomenological analysis .    in 4d",
    "the @xmath15 symmetry is anomalous ; it is broken by quantum effects .",
    "but quantum effects in 4d correspond to classical effects in 5d , so the symmetry should be explicitly broken in 5d .",
    "in unitary gauge , this is true .",
    "but in the form , we have restored the symmetry with our `` axion '' goldstone boson @xmath68 .",
    "in fact the whole @xmath69 is gauged , so there is a local symmetry under which @xmath70 we can use this to set @xmath71 , however it is helpful to retain these modes to simplify the calculations .    because of the gauge symmetry , the fields @xmath72 and @xmath68 are not strictly independent , but they do have different physical meanings as can be seen by introducing external sources ( and notation ) .",
    "we define @xmath73 the @xmath3 current is normalized as @xmath74 a source @xmath75 on the uv brane leads to @xmath76 after introducing @xmath77 and integrating by parts .",
    "so the source for @xmath77 is @xmath78 finally @xmath79 and @xmath68 by definition correspond to specific 4d fields , so we have @xmath80 note that we use constants @xmath81 and @xmath82 to normalize @xmath83 and @xmath84 , while the normalization of @xmath85 is set by the interaction strength @xmath86 in the lagrangian .",
    "these currents help us identify our pseudoscalar fields .",
    "we see that although @xmath72 and @xmath68 all mix they still have physical meanings : for a particular mode , @xmath68 is the `` glueball '' component and @xmath10 and @xmath77 are the `` quark '' components of the corresponding mesonic wavefunction , with @xmath77 related to the longitudinal mode of the axial vector field .",
    "we will now calculate the parameters in our model by matching to the qcd operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "let us start immediately with the case of interest , 3-flavors , massive quarks , and a physical @xmath11 .",
    "we will need to make use of the anomaly equation @xmath87 the anomaly shows up in the ope  @xcite @xmath88    as explained in detail elsewhere  @xcite , correlations functions are calculated in 5d by solving the equations of motion in the presence of a source .",
    "for example , this lets us deduce that @xmath89 in the case of interest , @xmath90 . for the @xmath91 correlator , which is relevant for the anomaly",
    ", we can write @xmath92 here , @xmath93 is a bulk - to - boundary propagator , that is , a solution to the equations of motion with @xmath94 . for this calculation ,",
    "chiral symmetry breaking is irrelevant to leading order and so we can set @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath91 and @xmath96 equations of motion then become @xmath97 these are solved perturbatively near @xmath28 by @xmath98 matching to leads to @xmath99    note that for this matching we have assumed that @xmath100 is constant in the uv . of course",
    ", @xmath100 runs with scale , and it is therefore reasonable to assume that @xmath100 would be a function of @xmath26 as the 1-loop qcd @xmath101 function .",
    "hence , we should take @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "the fact that @xmath100 varies slowly in the uv , and that @xmath104 , makes the above matching correct to leading order in @xmath100 .    instead of sourcing @xmath91 with @xmath105",
    ", we can also consider pure gluodynamics and source @xmath68 by turning on @xmath41 .",
    "this will fix the normalization of @xmath84 .",
    "the qcd correlation function of interest is  @xcite @xmath106 which should match @xmath107 for a solution with @xmath108 .",
    "solving the equations of motion perturbatively @xmath109 lets us deduce that @xmath110 we will use this later on to compute the topological susceptibility @xmath111 .",
    "next , we would also like to consider modifications to the background due to deviations from conformality , in particular the effect of the strange quark mass .",
    "consider the transverse part of the axial vector ope @xmath112 @xmath113 the @xmath114 term on the right hand side is determined by conformal invariance and is used to fit @xmath86 .",
    "the second term is the power correction in which we are interested now .",

    "then , using the ads green s function @xmath120  @xcite , the perturbative inhomogeneous solution can be written as @xmath121 \\\\   & = & \\left ( \\frac{2 g_5 ^ 2 m_q \\sigma}{3 } + \\frac{4 c_4}{3}\\right)\\frac{z^2}{q^2 } + { \\mathcal o}(z^3)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus ads gives @xmath122 comparing to , we deduce @xmath89 and @xmath123 the last equality follows from the gell - mann - oaks - renner relation  @xcite .      having determined @xmath124 and @xmath125 from matching to the ope , our lagrangian is complete .",
    "the remaining unknowns must be fit to data .",
    "we use @xmath126 this gives @xmath127 for strange and @xmath128 for up / down .",
    "thus we are justified in only turning on @xmath125 for the strange quark .",
    "keep in mind that although these``quark masses '' may seem small , care must be taken when comparing them to masses deduced from another scheme .",
    "there is one more parameter in our lagrangian that remains , @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath66 term corresponds to an entirely non - perturbative effect .",
    "however , it multiples a function which grows like @xmath129 , so we expect it to act effectively like a boundary condition forcing @xmath130 .",

    "the rms error is 18% .",
    "now , let us turn to the topological susceptibility , @xmath184 .",
    "the standard argument is that if there are massless quarks in the theory , then @xmath185 is unphysical , and thus @xmath184 must vanish . however , if all quarks are massive , or there are no quarks at all , then we expect @xmath184 to be nonzero .",
    "these facts lead the witten - veneziano relation  @xcite for the @xmath11 mass at large @xmath186 @xmath187 this relation , which gives @xmath188 mev)@xmath189 , is only approximate .",
    "it assumes all the decay constants are equal , that the mesons have no glueball component , and that @xmath186 is large .",
    "nevertheless , lattice seems to confirm these approximations  @xcite by producing @xmath190 . with our 5d construction",
    ", we can calculate the topological susceptibility , the meson masses , and the decay constants directly , and furthermore we can _ verify _ that @xmath184 vanishes only with massless quarks , from which the witten - veneziano relation follows .",
    "recall that @xmath191 for a solution with @xmath108 .",
    "first , consider the case of pure gluodynamics .",
    "then there are no @xmath10 or @xmath192 fields , and the equation of motion at zero momentum is simply @xmath193 in the absence of a @xmath66 term , it is simplest to just impose @xmath194 directly .",
    "then the solution is @xmath195 from .",
    "now suppose there are quarks .",
    "in the limit that the anomaly is weak ( for example at large @xmath186 ) , we can do a perturbation expansion in @xmath65 . to leading order in @xmath65 ,",

    "note that we have not used the @xmath66 term at all to calculate the topological susceptibility ; we have only used the fact that it leads to @xmath214 in pure gluodynamics , or @xmath215 if quarks are included .",
    "the @xmath66 term is supposed to represent some non - perturbative effects which are normally associated with instantons , so it is natural to ask if we can make the connection more precise . in qcd",
    "the one instanton contribution to the topological susceptibility can be calculated explicitly  @xcite @xmath216 ^ 2\\ ] ] here , @xmath217 is the dilute - gas instanton density .",
    "for example , for @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",
    "the bessel function @xmath220 appears as the fourier transform of @xmath41 evaluated on a one - instanton solution .",
    "this expression is divergent due to large instantons , so one normally cuts off the integral at @xmath221 .    in qcd",
    "it is not meaningful to compare the contribution of this specific gauge configuration to any particular calculation on the ads side .",
    "this is because the five - dimensional dual describes only gauge invariant quantities resulting from integration over all gauge configurations , and it is not clear in which sense this particular configuration dominates the integral .",
    "nevertheless , in truly conformal theories , where the coupling constant is a marginal parameter , it makes sense to compare non - perturbative contributions to correlators ( _ i.e. _ in powers of @xmath222 ) between the cft and the five - dimensional theory . of course",
    ", the axion would have a similar bulk description in such a case , the main difference being the @xmath26-dependence of the @xmath66-like term in the dual to the cft .",
    "we thus expect that the @xmath66 term contribution to some correlation function to have structures similar to those one gets from integration over instanton size , since the bulk integration over the @xmath26-variable , must ultimately reproduce the same correlation function in the cft .    to see the similarity to the instanton calculation , let us look at the @xmath223 two - point function from the bulk perspective .",
    "we can solve for @xmath68 perturbatively around the conformal limit . in the conformal approximation",
    ", there is no ir brane , and the axion bulk - to - boundary propagator ( with @xmath224 ) is @xmath225 conformality is broken by the ir brane and by the @xmath66 term . with these effects ,",
    "the equation of motion becomes @xmath226 where @xmath227 includes the non - conformal @xmath26-dependence of the @xmath66 term .",
    "now , we can get a simple expression for the topological susceptibility by integrating the action by parts on the equations of motion @xmath228   =   c^2 \\lim_{z \\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{a\\partial_z a}{z^3 } = 2 n_f \\chi_t ( q)\\ ] ] if conformal invariance is a good approximation , we can estimate the effect of conformal symmetry breaking by evaluating this expression on @xmath229 .",
    "we thus find @xmath230 ^ 2\\ ] ] this has exactly the same form as the instanton contribution .",
    "thus , the scale dependence of the @xmath66 term acts just like the instanton density and the ir brane provides a natural cutoff on the integral over instanton size .    finally , let us say a word about the qcd vacuum angle @xmath185 .",
    "this angle is intimately tied to the solution of the @xmath1 problem .",
    "the argument , roughly , is that the topological susceptibility must be nonzero to split the @xmath11 from the @xmath10 and the @xmath9 .",
    "since the topological susceptibility is the second variation of the effective action with respect to @xmath185 , there must be sensitivity to @xmath185 in qcd .",
    "thus the strong cp problem , which is why the apparent value of @xmath185 is so tiny ( @xmath231 ) , must be taken seriously .    in ads , there are three angles , appearing in the @xmath43 and @xmath39 vevs , and in the @xmath66 term .",
    "we can write @xmath232 ,  @xmath233 and @xmath234 . since @xmath235 and @xmath236 come from vevs , they can be functions of @xmath26 ( as in eqs.([xvev],[yvev ] ) ) , but @xmath237 , like @xmath66 , should be a constant . in full generality , @xmath235 can have flavor indices as well .",
    "this leads to @xmath238 ^ 2 +    \\frac{c^2}{2 z^3 } [ a_5 ^ 0 + \\partial_z ( a - \\theta_2)]^2 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2 z^5 }    v^{n_f } ( a - \\eta^0 - \\theta_3)^2\\ ] ] now , the axial symmetries in ads are local gauge symmetries , so we can rotate @xmath239 and @xmath236 into @xmath79 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "this leaves @xmath240 as the physical vacuum angle .",
    "although the combination @xmath241 couples directly to @xmath242 , it can not be the physical axion which solves the strong @xmath243 problem . even though @xmath244 , @xmath242 can not be eliminated since it is @xmath68 and @xmath10 which appear in the rest of the lagrangian , not the orthogonal combination @xmath245",
    ". however , there is hope that since ads allows a quantitative study of confinement , a strong - dynamics based solution to the strong cp problem might be realizable .",
    "we have studied the @xmath1 problem through and extra - dimensional model inspired by the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this model is built from the bottom up , by fitting some parameters to perturbative qcd correlation functions and others to data .",
    "all of the parameters in the model can be determined by the experimental masses of the @xmath9 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 mesons , and the pion decay constant @xmath248 .",
    "this is only one more experimental value than is needed to define qcd itself ( in qcd , we have the quark masses @xmath249 and",
    "@xmath52 and the value of @xmath29 ) . in particular , no strong - dynamics based observable , such as the topological susceptibility , is needed to study the @xmath11 . instead , we only need the coefficient of the anomaly which is perturbatively calculable and 1-loop finite .",
    "the non - perturbative effects are represented in our model with a @xmath66 term , on which we have shown the observables are only weakly dependent . using this construction , we have calculated @xmath250 mev , which is 9% off from experiment .",
    "we have also calculated its decay constants , and its coupling to photons , as well as the analog quantities for the @xmath10 . the best fit for @xmath66 matches the four observables to 18% .",
    "in addition to being quantitatively precise , the extra - dimensional construction allows for additional qualitative insight into the u(1 ) problem and related issues .",
    "for example , we have shown how the vanishing of a quark masses would cause the topologically susceptibility to vanish , independent of any discussion of the theta angle @xmath242 of qcd . from this , the witten - veneziano relations follow . in qcd , it is difficult to study the contribution of non - perturbative effects , because one can not turn off the anomaly except by taking @xmath251 . in the holographic model",
    "there are two additional parameters , @xmath66 and @xmath252 which can be separately dialed , giving us new handles on the anomaly .",
    "we also showed that the non - perturbative contribution to the topologically susceptibility , which can be represented with an instanton calculation , has a direct analog in ads .",
    "the same bessel functions appear in both cases , and the integral over instanton size is replaced by an integral over the extra dimension . instead of having to invoke a separate cutoff to regulate the ir divergence",
    ", we naturally use the same ir cutoff we would have in a non - anomalous theory .",
    "this solution to the @xmath1 problem demonstrates the versatility of the bottom - up ads / qcd approach .",
    "it also emphasizes that ads is not just a complicated way of phrasing the predictions of chiral perturbation theory ",
    "the @xmath11 mass is simply a free parameter in the chiral lagrangian . although our effective description is non - renormalizable , higher - dimension operators are quantitatively irrelevant for the observables in question , as is expected from naive dimensional analysis .",
    "it is therefore likely that through further application of the ads / qcd correspondence , additional quantitative and qualitative information about the non - perturbative structure of gauge theories can be derived .",
