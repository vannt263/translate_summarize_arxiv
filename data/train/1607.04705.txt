    "these two works employ opposite strategies .",
    "the maebashi and fukuyama formula is on the basis of the fermi - surface harmonics which is the polynomial of the velocity .",

    "the interaction is diagonalized but the velocity is expanded in terms of the scattering eigenfunction .    by these two formulae",
    "we know the exact forms of the dc conductivity of anisotropic fermi liquids .",
    "consequently it becomes evident that there is no room for the current - vertex - correction discussed in the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation  @xcite .",
    "* 2 - 1 fermi - surface harmonics expansion *    we start from the fermi - liquid formula  @xcite for the dc conductivity @xmath0 which is ( 2.34 ) of @xcite and equivalent to the result of the linearized boltzmann equation , ( 58 ) of @xcite .    using the fermi - surface harmonics  @xcite , @xmath1 , ( [ fl ] )",

    "the conductivity tensor reduces to a scalar @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "this means the integrand in ( [ dyadic ] ) is proportional to the scalar product @xmath45 . thus introducing the anisotropic life time @xmath46 , the vector mean free path is written as @xmath47",
