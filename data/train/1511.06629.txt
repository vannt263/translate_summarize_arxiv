    "over the last decade fundamental phenomena in many - body rydberg systems have been discovered , from dipole blockade  @xcite and antiblockade  @xcite over long - range molecules  @xcite to excitonic dynamics due to resonant dipole - dipole interactions  @xcite .",
    "underlying all of these are strong long range interactions @xcite , which also make rydberg atoms promising for quantum computing  , quantum simulators  @xcite and model systems for biological processes  @xcite .",
    "it also became apparent , that the interplay of atomic motion and excitonic dynamics  @xcite yields entanglement transport  @xcite and conical intersections ( cis )  @xcite .",
    "the latter play a crucial role in many quantum chemical processes , where they enable highly non - adiabatic dynamics on an ultrafast timescale  @xcite .",
    "they may also protect the dna structure from damage by uv radiation  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have explored how conical intersections affect the wavepackets of atomic motion , which describe the entanglement transport and the associated energy and momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the ci can split those wavepackets , resulting in a superposition of two different excitation transfer processes . since the relative weight of the processes",
    "after the splitting can be tuned through the system geometry and hence ci position , this gives rise to a sensitive switch for exciton transport properties .",
    "here we show the evolution of the underlying exciton spectra as a function of time in more detail .",
    "we also provide a parameter space survey for the operation of the conical intersection switch .",
    "our results are derived from a model of isotropic dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "we finally show qualitatively similar features using the inherently anisotropic dipole - dipole interactions , where the anisotropy is suppressed through the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "dipole - dipole forces between atoms in two different rydberg states @xmath0 and @xmath1 cause a strong interdependence of atomic motion and rydberg state dynamics  @xcite . on a homogeneous chain of all but one atom in state @xmath0 , a single @xmath1 excitation will delocalize forming a frenkel exciton  @xcite . if the chain has a dislocation formed by two more closely spaced atoms , the exciton localises on these and in a repulsive state causes a combined pulse of chain dislocation , excitation and entanglement to propagate through the chain , akin to newton s cradle  @xcite . in the scenario considered here ,",
    "this combined pulse is directed towards a second chain orthogonal to the first , causing atoms to reach a configuration with a conical intersection in the exciton energy spectrum .",
    "the intersection causes non - adiabatic effects , triggering two different modes of pulse propagation on the second chain .",
    "the basic mechanism by which the conical intersection acts as a switch between these modes , can best be understood considering the essential subunit of two orthogonal atomic dimers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ basics ] , we discuss rydberg aggregates and their numerical treatment .",
    "we then proceed in section  [ sec : nges4 ] to describe a double rydberg dimer , with two atoms freely moving on each of two orthogonal chains .",
    "we study the consequences of a conical intersection and characterise the dynamics on each of the two participating potential surfaces .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ sec : nges8 ] we extend this setup to a seven atom system , with three and four atoms on the two chains . in section  [ exciton_switch ]",
    "we highlight how the conical intersection can be functionalised as a switch controlling the transport dynamics on the second chain . finally in section  [ bfield ]",

    "possible future extensions could be velocity adjustments of rydberg atoms via external fields , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in this article we have employed an isotropic interaction model with just one participating azimuthal quantum number , which results in numerical simplifications and easier interpretation of quantum dynamics .",
    "we have demonstrated how this model can experimentally be realized using a magnetic field . however , the essential physics reported , the splitting of a rydberg atom wave - packet onto multiple born - oppenheimer surfaces through acceleration by resonant dipole - dipole interactions is a generic feature of higher dimensional rydberg aggregates .",
    "it neither relies on any of the above simplifications ( as shown here ) nor on the confinement of atomic motion on one - dimensional lines ( as we will report in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , note that similar transport processes on different energy scales could be studied through rydberg dressed dipole - dipole interactions @xcite , or could rely on rydberg atoms immersed in host cold atom clouds @xcite instead of individual atoms .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions with alexander eisfeld and sebastian mbius .",
    "as demonstrated in section  [ bfield ] , an external magnetic field can be used to reduce the number of electronic angular momentum states participating in the dynamics of rydberg aggregates and thus render the interactions predominantly isotropic .",
    "here we describe the underlying model and analytically derive an expression for the resulting effective interactions , including anisotropic correction terms .",
    "we additionally discuss spin of the rydberg atoms , and show that the same mechanism that renders interactions isotropic also removes spin as a degree of freedom .    besides including the azimuthal quantum number in our extended single excitation basis @xmath126 , see section  [ bfield ] , we also have to describe the spin of the atoms , where it suffices to label the z - component for each atom @xmath58 by @xmath127 .",
    "we start by defining the hamiltonian for the interaction of the magnetic field with @xmath2 atoms , given by @xmath128 the magnetic field @xmath129 points in z - direction and @xmath130 , @xmath131 denote the operators of angular momentum and spin in z - direction for the @xmath58th atom , and @xmath132 is the bohr magneton .",
    "a spin configuration for the aggregate is uniquely defined by the tuple @xmath133^\\mathrm{t}$ ] .",
    "we denote the corresponding state with @xmath134 , which is the product state of all single atom spin states , labeled for the @xmath58th atom with @xmath135 . introducing the quantum number for the z - component of the aggregate spin @xmath136 which is the sum over all individual spin quantum numbers ,",
    "the energy shift of the magnetic field is for @xmath137 states given by @xmath138 the detuning between the @xmath117 and @xmath118 states inside a single @xmath139-manifold is @xmath140 .",
    "this has to be larger than the anisotropic matrix elements of dipole - dipole interactions , which for lithium atoms and our typical parameters also makes it larger than the finestructure - splitting .",
    "this implies we are in a strong field regime , where spin and angular momentum couple separately to the magnetic field , which effectively removes the finestructure and gives an energy level structure sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic_field : energy_levels ]  ( b ) .",
    "the energy spacing in this strong field regime is @xmath141 , which is of the order of @xmath142  mhz .",
    "the finestructure furthermore yields doublets for neighboring states with @xmath143 , sketched as red and blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic_field : energy_levels ]  ( b ) .",
    "the only singlet states with @xmath144 are the manifolds @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "hence we concentrate on the @xmath145 manifold , which can be well addressed during the rydberg excitation process .",
    "the magnetic field yields increasing decoupling of the @xmath145 manifold from the @xmath147 manifold with increasing magnetic field strength .",
    "we study this decoupling in detail , giving the hamiltonian structure in appendix  [ isotrope_dip_dip_int : setup ] and derive effective interactions in appendix  [ isotrope_dip_dip_int : blockdiag ] .",
    "the only coupling of the @xmath148 state to other manifolds than @xmath147 is through spin - orbit interactions and can thus be neglected .      here",
    "we derive the hamiltonian for a rydberg aggregate in an external magnetic field pointing in the z - direction , where the magnetic field shift is much larger than the finestructure .",
    "this strong field regime allows a reduction of the electronic hilbert space to a single spin manifold .",
    "all atoms are assumed to be located within a plane , as in all cases considered here , with quantization axis perpendicular to that plane .",
    "then , the @xmath115 manifold is already completely decoupled @xcite .",
