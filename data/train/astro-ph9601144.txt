    "the hubble space telescope has made it possible to derive boron abundances for cool stars by observation of the  resonance doublet at 250 nm .",

    "these abundances , for stars of different ages and in different evolutionary stages , can give important clues to the origin of the light elements and to stellar evolution .",
    "it is important that the abundances derived are correct , so the validity of the stellar abundance analyst s standard approximations of plane - parallel stellar atmospheres with line formation in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( ) must be investigated .",
    "kiselman ( 1994 ) investigated the statistical equilibrium of neutral boron in three solar - type atmospheric models and found significant departures from  in stars hotter or more metal - poor than the sun .",
    "the most important process causing these departures was found to be the pumping in the ultraviolet resonance lines that gives rise to line source functions exceeding the local planckian value and to overionisation .",
    "the effects on derived abundances are significant when it comes to interpretation of observations of metal - poor halo stars ( edvardsson et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the formation of  lines in cool stars and to provide non-  abundance corrections in a form that is convenient to use for general observers . to this end",
    "we have studied the  lines in a grid of model atmospheres and for a range of boron abundances .",
    "we will first present the techniques used , then discuss the line - formation circumstances and their dependence on atmospheric parameters , and finally present abundance corrections that are of practical use for abundance analysts using spectral synthesis .",
    "the discussion concentrates on the lines which are of observational interest , the least blended in each of the 250 nm and 209 nm doublets , that is @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , all wavelengths from johansson et al .",
    "these lines will be referred to as the 250 nm and the 209 nm lines .",
    "the 209 nm doublet holds some promise in being useful for determining boron isotopic ratios ( johansson et al .",
    "1993 ) , but no detailed observational analysis of these lines have yet been published .",

    "we express elemental abundances on the customary scale where the abundance @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the logarithm , base 10 .",
    "overall metallicity is given relative to solar as @xmath6 = \\lg { n({\\rm fe } ) \\over n({\\rm h } ) } - \\lg { n({\\rm fe } ) \\over n({\\rm h})}_{\\sun}.\\ ] ] to comply with common usage in stellar atmosphere work , the logarithm of the surface gravity , @xmath7 is given with @xmath8 in cgs units .",
    "quantities denoted with an asterisk , e.g. @xmath9 , are  values .",
    "the model atmospheres were produced using the code osmarcs of edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) which is an extended version of the marcs program ( gustafsson et al .",
    "this code includes a great number of spectral lines in the blue and ultraviolet by means of opacity sampling .",
    "the line data are from the kurucz compilation ( e.g. kurucz 1991 ) and it has been claimed ( kurucz 1991 ; edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ) that inclusion of these opacities solves the so - called `` missing - opacity problem '' for the blue and ultraviolet parts of the solar spectrum .",
    "it has , however , been questioned ( bell et al .",
    "1994 , see also gustafsson 1995 and bell & tripicco 1995 ) whether the adding of these line opacities really solve the problem in the right way , i.e. the resulting models may reproduce the observed flux spectrum well at low resolution but badly at high resolution .",
    "if this is the case , systematic errors may appear in comparisons of different stars .",
    "we consider , however , these models as the best choice , since they apparently are successful in reproducing the ultraviolet fluxes of solar - type stars of different metallicities ( edvardsson et al . 1993 , duncan et al .",
    "1992 ) , something which is crucial for the current study .",
    "the radiation - field values for different depths and wavelengths that are produced by the atmosphere code are saved and used in the non-  spectral modelling for the calculation of the fixed radiative rates .",
    "the parameters of the atmospheric grid are displayed in table  [ tab_grid_params ] .",
    "the temperature and gravity ranges were determined by the limitations of the osmarcs code .",
    "we are aware that some of the combinations of fundamental parameters are unlikely to correspond to any observed stars .",
    "all models were calculated with a gaussian microturbulent velocity of 2.0kms@xmath10 , this was also used in the subsequent line calculations .",
    "the relative elemental abundances assumed for the atmospheres and for the background opacities in the non-  calculations are the solar abundances of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "the exception is iron , for which we use the meteoritic abundance of 7.51 which is close to what analyses of feii lines give ( e.g. holweger et al .",

    "this version also allows the inclusion of spectral lines in the background opacities for the line transitions treated in detail , as described in the following section .",
    "kiselman ( 1994 ) did not include the effect of other lines blending with the  resonance lines  the `` background '' opacities were just the continuous ones .",

    "our treatment of blending is schematic for the shortest - wavelength lines but gets more detailed towards longer wavelengths :    * the shortest - wavelength resonance lines are treated in the same way as the photoionisations , i.e. the transitions are considered to be fixed , with radiation fields computed by the atmospheric code , thus including the effect of line blanketing in an averaged way .",

    "the calculation of the boltzmann - saha populations needed for the background line opacities is handled by the continuous - opacity package .",

    "the departures from  that kiselman ( 1994 ) found for the metal - poor atmosphere with low boron abundance can be described as follows .",

    "the hot , non - local , ultraviolet radiation field causes an optical - pumping effect where the excitation balance is shifted upwards relative to  so that @xmath35 .",
    "the line opacities are set by the ionisation balance which departs from the saha equilibrium in that neutral boron is depleted  overionisation .",
    "the pumping in the resonance lines causes this because the radiation fields in the ionisation edges of the excited levels are so much richer than at the ground - state ionisation edge .",
    "furthermore , these radiation fields are stronger than the local planckian value .    the pumping and",
    "the overionisation will both make absorption lines weaker than in , leading to underestimations of the boron abundance when  is assumed .",
    "we calculate the two - level line source function    @xmath36    where @xmath37 measures the destruction probability of line photons ( stimulated emission neglected ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath38 was then studied as a measure of how good the two - level approximation for each atmosphere and boron abundance in the grid .",
    "it turned out that this ratio falls very close to 1 for the largest part of the grid , both with and without background lines , the exceptions are mainly for the cooler stars in the case including background lines , where the ratio goes down to @xmath39 for some models with low b abundance .",
    "this is because the line source functions for the two doublet components are forced to be equal by the strong coupling between their lower levels , while @xmath40 is quite different for the two components due to the different strength of the background lines .",
    "we consider the two - level picture adequate for discussing the departures from  over the entire grid .",
    "this means that much of the discussion of kiselman ( 1994 ) is valid .    over most of the grid , the  resonance lines experience pumping from the hot , non - local , radiation field .",
    "the pumping effect decreases as the boron lines grow stronger .",
    "the relative overionisation at a given optical depth increases towards higher temperatures , lower metallicities , and lower surface gravities .",

    "when the  lines become strong , the pumping effect weakens leading to less overionisation , as can be seen when comparing figs .",

    "the pumping - induced overionisation eventually turns into its opposite  the `` photon suction '' described by bruls et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for nai and ksc i  which actually causes a marginal underionisation ( overabundance of neutral boron ) in the coldest , metal - rich , atmospheres of high boron abundances .",
    "the introduction of background lines should decrease the optical pumping effect simply by decreasing the local mean intensity at the line frequency .",

    "we will here present non-  corrections that can be used to improve  abundance estimates .",
    "we give such corrections rather than , e.g. , presenting non-  curves of growth because corrections are less model - dependent , and because line blending makes it difficult to unambiguously compute or measure equivalent widths needed for a curve a growth .",
    "the ordinary procedure to get such abundance corrections is to calculate both  and non-  equivalent widths for a range of abundances .",
    "the two resulting curves of growth are then used to interpolate the and the non-  abundances implied by a certain equivalent width .",
    "the non-  abundance corrections can be tabulated as functions of abundance or line strength and atmospheric parameters .",
    "this procedure is straightforward when the background continuum of the line that is studied varies little over the line width .",
    "but when we introduce lines in the background opacities , equivalent widths can be defined in several ways which will give somewhat different results when curves of growth are compared .",
    "we choose here to use a definition that essentially measures the area contained between the line and the background flux in a plot that is normalised in the way of figs .",
    "[ fig_bspec_250 ] and [ fig_bspec_209 ] .",
    "we believe this to be the measure that corresponds best with the result an abundance analyst gets when fitting synthetic spectra to observations ( kiselman & carlsson 1995 ) .    in practice",
    ", we use the equivalent widths as they are output from the program , their numerical values thus including a dominating contribution from the background lines . for numerical reasons ,",
    "we subtract the equivalent - width value from a run with zero boron abundance .",

    "the range in  abundance for each plot is naturally limited by the boron abundance grid .",
    "we have also introduced limits to ensure that the lines are strong enough to be of any observational interest and that they are weak enough for our modelling to be relevant .",
    "the lower limit on line strength is @xmath43 ( from the case without background lines ) .",
    "the upper limit is set to assure that the line centre is optically thin at the uppermost point of the model atmosphere ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the curves in the plots are generally flat , illustrating that the departures from  are set by the background radiation fields as long as the  lines are weak . when the resonance lines become strong enough to influence their own radiation fields , the pumping effects decreases , and so does the overionisation",
    "this leads to the downturn in the abundance correction curves seen in many of the plots . in some cases , for the exotic parameter combination of hot , very metal - poor stars with high boron abundance",
    ", there is a hint of an upturn instead .",
    "the boron lines are here still rather weak ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig_bspec_250 ] and [ fig_bspec_209 ] ) , and we interpret the upturn as a result of the lines being formed at greater heights in the atmosphere where the relative overionisation is larger .",

    "compare this with fig .",

    "more details are given in table  [ tab_files ] .",
    "for quick reference , we also present numerical values for the corrections ( 250 nm ) over a part of the grid representing solar - like stars in table  [ tab_tab ] .        the model - atom uncertainties are discussed by kiselman ( 1994 ) who concludes that they are not likely to be the most important cause of errors .",
    "our corrections are model dependent and should really only be applied to  results acquired with the same atmospheric models .",
    "model - atmosphere errors and differences , within the plane - parallel paradigm , will , however , probably influence the non - corrections only to second order .",
    "effects caused by granulation and other kinds of photospheric inhomogeneity is probably a matter of greater concern .",
    "( and would be so even if the lines were formed in perfect . )",
    "the 250 nm doublet is approaching optical thickness in the uppermost point of our solar - like atmospheric models with high boron abundance when background lines are included .",
    "the modelling is then not very realistic , especially since the lines should be affected by a chromospheric temperature rise .",
    "everything seems to imply , however , that departures from  will be small for stars similar to the sun .",
    "errors in the line lists and inadequacies in our treatment of background lines influence the results in two ways .",
    "first , errors in oscillator strengths and non-  effects can cause the background opacities to be erroneous .",
    "this could in principle be mended by detailed fitting to observed spectra .",
    "( something which would be needed anyhow to allow for the detailed abundance pattern of individual stars . )",
    "second , errors in the background source function are introduced by treating the line opacities as pure absorption .",
    "this will tend to thermalise the transitions involved .",
    "the effect of photon escape , which would lead to @xmath46 for strong lines is expected to be suppressed leading to a line source function of the boron line that is too close to the  value .",
    "abundance corrections will then be close to zero instead of negative ( if overionisation is negligible ) .",
    "we have investigated the latter effect by introducing a scattering part in the background line opacities via a line - photon destruction probability @xmath47 that is calculated using van regemorter s ( 1962 ) approximation for the collisional rate .",
    "thus the absorption fraction of the line opacity is @xmath48 and the scattering fraction @xmath49    this was done for atmospheric models representing the sun , procyon and the halo star hd140283 ( the same models as in kiselman 1994 ) and the same range of b abundances as in the main grid .",

    "[ fig_abcorr_ng4][fig_abcorr_ag45 ] ) for the cases with ( solid curves ) and without ( dashed curves ) scattering in background lines .",
    "the effect of introducing the background scattering is to increase the magnitude of the abundance corrections , regardless whether these are positive or negative .",
    "( note the crossing of the curves at the zero level for the solar 250 nm case . )",
    "this is expected since we decrease the photon - destruction probability and thus increase the effective photon path length  the non - local nature of the radiation field is enhanced .",
    "the differences in abundance corrections are , however , small  never more than 0.1dex    we conclude that a refined treatment of background lines may make the non-  corrections slightly greater .",
