    "experimentally , all total cross - sections rise asymptotically with energy , but it is not clear whether the rate of increase is the same for different processes . to appreciate it at a glance , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : tx ] a compilation of available data on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the data span an energy range of four orders of magnitude . to plot them all on the same scale",
    ", we have multiplied the relevant cross - section by a constant factor @xmath4 for each incident photon . in this figure , we have taken @xmath5 to be @xmath6 , purely on the grounds to have all the cross - sections in the low energy region to be close in value to each other .",
    "one simple way to estimate this value consists in counting the fermion lines in the proton and the photon and the probability of basic quark - antiquark scattering . through this the factor",
    "is found to be @xmath7 the same result is obtained using vector meson dominance ( vmd ) with pure @xmath8 coupling @xcite .",
    "this scaling is very approximate .",
    "further there is no reason to expect the scaling factor to be energy independent .",
    "this can be easily understood by noting that at low energy the photon behaves like a vector meson in its interactions with matter , while at high energies qcd phenomena which are energy dependent will appear .",
    "thus while at low energies the factor @xmath5 can be evaluated through vmd considerations  @xcite which may include other vector mesons beyond the @xmath9 , at high energy it is likely to be different  @xcite due to the difference in the quark and gluon content of photons  @xcite and that of the hadrons .    to understand the role played by the quark - parton structure of the photon , one can use a qcd model such as the one developed in @xcite , and apply it to evaluate cross - sections for processes involving photons . in the following",
    ", we shall describe the model for protons and then apply it to photons .",
    "this model is based on the following :    1 .   qcd mini - jets to drive the rise of the total cross - section in the qcd asymptotic freedom regime ; 2 .",
    "resummation of soft gluon emission down to zero momentum to soften the rise due to the increasing number of gluon - gluon collisions between hard perturbative , but low - x , gluons ; 3 .",
    "eikonal representation for the total cross - section ( with @xmath10 ) to incorporate the mini - jet cross - section , using an impact parameter distribution obtained as the fourier transform of resummed soft gluon transverse momentum distribution .",
    "each of these components will be discussed in detail , before applying it to obtain the total cross - section .",
    "the mini - jet cross - section is obtained by integrating the standard qcd inclusive jet cross - section , using a lower cutoff @xmath11 @xmath12 , and is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the colliding hadrons .",
    "this cross - section strongly depends on the value chosen for such @xmath11 and -for a fixed cut off- it increases with energy , reflecting the sharp increase in the number of low - x gluons with increasing energy .",
    "this increase is very rapid and , if left unchecked , the mini - jet cross - section would surpass the observed total cross - section .",
    "the saturation mechanism which restores the froissart bound comes from another qcd mechanism , soft gluon emission , which will be described in the next subsection .",
    "the mini - jet cross - sections are calculated using realistic parton densities ( pdfs ) .",
    "the most common ones for the proton are grv @xcite , mrst @xcite , cteq @xcite , whereas those for the photon are grv@xcite , grs @xcite , cjkl @xcite .",
    "these densities are available both at leading order ( lo ) or higher , but in our model we use only the lo given the fact that part of the nlo effects are described by the soft gluon resummation discussed in the next section .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : miniphoton ] the energy dependence of the mini - jet cross - sections for @xmath3 collisions , for three different sets of parton densities , grv , grs and cjkl , for a typical value of the cut - off , @xmath16 .     value . ]",
    "we stress the distinction between low - x gluons which participate in hard parton - parton scattering described by the mini - jet cross - section discussed in the previous section , and the soft gluons emitted in any given parton - parton process .",
    "soft gluons by definition need to be resummed , and hence their momentum integrated up to a maximum value",
    ". the maximum value should typically be @xmath17 of the emitting parton energy , the lower value is usually taken to correspond to the intrinsic transverse momentum scale of the scattering hadron . instead we extend the integration down to the zero momentum modes . to do so , we need therefore to make an anstz as to the behaviour of the strong coupling constant in the infrared region , where the usual asymptotic freedom expression for @xmath18 can not be used .",
    "our proposal is that in the infrared limit , one can phenomenologically use the expression @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the qcd constant in the scheme chosen for the hard scattering calculation , and @xmath21 is a parameter which embeds the infrared behavior with @xmath22 so that the soft gluon integrals converge .",
    "the constant in front of eq .",
    "[ phenoas ] should be chosen to provide a smooth extrapolation to the perturbative expression for @xmath23 .",
    "our choice for the interpolating function is @xmath24 } } \\label{alphas}\\ ] ] this expression is used in the soft gluon resummation formula in the transverse momentum variable which reads : @xmath25 with @xmath26\\ ] ] in qed @xmath27 and resummation in transverse momentum variable is well approximated by first order expansion in @xmath28 . in qcd ,",
    "the situation is completely different because @xmath23 is ( i ) not a constant and ( ii ) can become very large as the gluon transverse momentum goes to zero . in phenomenological applications ,",
    "resummation is typically exploited by splitting the integral between the very soft and the non - infrared region so that @xmath29 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx c_0 b^2 + c_1 \\int_\\mu^{q_{max } } { { dk_t^2}\\over{k_t^2 } } \\alpha_s(k_t^2 ) \\log ( { { 2q_{max}}\\over{k_t}})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as mentioned before , our approach is different .",
    "we use eq .",
    "[ alphas ] and @xmath30.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy dependent quantity @xmath31 represents the maximum energy allowed to a soft gluon in a given parton - parton interaction , and it depends upon the kinematics , i.e. the parton energy fractions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and from the emitted parton momentum @xmath34 .",
    "( this is described explicitly in @xcite ) .      a convenient formalism to calculate total cross - sections is provided by the eikonal integral for the elastic amplitude , valid for small angle scattering .",
    "using the optical theorem , the total cross - section can be written as @xmath35\\ ] ] a simple model for calculating the eikonal function @xmath36 consists in evaluating the probability of inelastic processes , obtained by summing over all possible poisson distributed collisions .",
    "one then obtains @xmath37\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the average number of inelastic collisions . neglecting the real part of the eikonal",
    ", one finds @xmath39\\ ] ] this expression has the advantage of satisfying unitarity , but it requires knowledge of the impact parameter distribution of the scattering particles .",
    "we propose this distribution to be given by the fourier transform of the soft gluon distribution discussed in the previous section , namely @xmath40 and approximate @xmath38 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 represents the average number of collisions with outgoing partons with @xmath43 , with all other collisions of non perturbative description included in @xmath44 .",
    "this quantity is often parametrized by factorizing completely the @xmath45 and @xmath46 dependence , and using the fourier transform of the relevant hadron form factor to describe the impact parameter distribution . instead , in our model",
    ", we do not use a factorised form in @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and write @xmath49\\ ] ] with @xmath50 a constant to fix the overall normalization , and @xmath51 depending upon the process being proton - proton or proton - antiproton respectively . here",
    ", @xmath52 is obtained from the bloch - nordsieck ( bn ) model with @xmath53 parametrized so as to always remain @xmath54 of the value of @xmath11 . for proton - proton and proton - antiproton scattering",
    "we show the results of our model in figure [ fig : regge ] , where we also show comparison with other models @xcite .",
    "the model described previously can now be applied to the photon processes .",
    "an extremely simple exercise is to use factorization as @xmath55 one can then either parametrize @xmath56 or choose an appropriate constant as we did in fig .",
    "[ fig : tx ] . the result is shown in figs . [",
    "fig : gamp ] and [ fig : gg ] where the green band corresponds to the band for proton - proton scattering of fig .",
    "[ fig : regge ] multiplied by @xmath6 and @xmath57 respectively .     and the dotted line to @xcite . ]",
    "a more involved exercise is to follow the same eikonalization procedure as outlined for the proton cross - sections , using the experimentally determined photonic parton densities , and then compare it with data , as well as other model predictions . in such case",
    ", one needs to know how to apply to the photon a typically hadronic description like the eikonal representation .",
    "quite a while ago @xcite , the following expression was proposed for photon processes : @xmath58^l\\int d^2{\\bf b}[1-e^{-n^{\\gamma}(b , s)/2 } ] \\label{eq : eikg}\\ ] ] with @xmath59^{l}n_{soft}(b , s)+n_{hard}^{\\gamma } \\label{eq : nb}\\ ] ] and with @xmath60^l } } \\label{eq : nhard}\\ ] ] with @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath3 respectively , @xmath63 to be calculated using current photon densities , and @xmath64 given by eq.[abn ] with the appropriate @xmath65 for the photon processes .    in the above described expressions",
    ", there appears the quantity @xmath66 , which represents the probability that the photon behaves like a hadron in the eikonal formulation .",
    "a possibility is to use vmd models , namely @xmath67 where the sum extends to all vector mesons , not just the @xmath9 .",
    "as the photon energy increases , the contribution from the other , resolved , components also increases and one can expect @xmath66 to differ from the vmd proposal . using a phenomenologically fixed value @xmath68 we obtain the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gg ] for the @xmath3 case , using grs densities .",
    "total cross - sections from factorization ( green band ) or using the eikonal with grs densities and soft gluon resummation . ]",
    "please notice that the parameter @xmath69 appearing elsewhere in this note is a purely phenomenological multiplicative factor between the total photon and proton cross - sections , and it is different from @xmath66 , which is defined through the eikonal and @xmath70 through the cross - sections .",
    "it is however to be expected that both parameters be of the same order of magnitude , namely of @xmath71 .",
    "we notice that while factorization a la gribov could still hold for @xmath62 , the same can not be said for @xmath3 where present data do appear to be higher than the curve obtained by the simple factorization hypothesis . on the other hand a more detailed model , like the mini - jet cum soft gluon resummation appears better suited to describe the present photon - photon data .",
