    "the study of hadron structure and , in particular , the spin structure of the proton is one of the most exciting challenges facing modern nuclear and particle physics . through measurements of high energy scattering of electroweak probes one can measure the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which describe the number densities of partons with momentum fraction , @xmath1 , in the nucleon .",
    "the study of the spin and flavor dependence of the pdfs has provided a wealth of data which has proven critical to our understanding of the structure of the nucleon  @xcite .    in recent years , the extension of this concept to so - called generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) has attracted enormous interest  @xcite .",
    "the gpds are related to the amplitude for deeply virtual compton scattering where the initial and final photons have different momenta .",
    "it is widely anticipated that the gpds should provide even more information concerning the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "of particular relevance to our present work is the link between the low moments of the gpds and the angular momentum carried by each quark flavor within the proton  @xcite .",
    "this is now widely considered essential to a satisfactory resolution of the famous proton spin crisis  @xcite , because successful models suggest that a great deal of the proton spin is carried as quark orbital angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "there have been many theoretical and experimental studies of the gpds . on the theoretical side ,",
    "much of the work has centered on the most effect ways to parameterize them  @xcite .",
    "there has also been quite a bit of work on phenomenological models , such as the mit and cloudy bag model  @xcite , the constituent quark model  @xcite , the njl model @xcite , the light - front model  @xcite , the color glass condensate model  @xcite and the bethe - salpeter approach @xcite . on the experimental side",
    ", various groups have focussed on different kinematic ranges .",
    "zeus and h1 measured the dvcs cross section for the first time , with @xmath2 in the very low range @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "compass focussed on a little larger @xmath2  from @xmath4 to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the data from hermes is in the range @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the study of the high @xmath2 domain , where valence quarks should dominate , requires high luminosity and a high energy electron beam . with the jlab 12 gev upgrade",
    ", @xmath2 will range up to 0.7 , while the current jlab data is in the range @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the gpds have a close relationship with the form factors . by integrating the gpds with different powers of the momentum fraction @xmath1",
    ", the gpds can be transformed into mellin moments .",
    "there has been important work on the moments and form factors from various lattice qcd collaborations  @xcite , as well as chiral perturbation theory @xcite . as for many other observables computed in lattice qcd",
    ", current lattice simulations have been concentrated at quite large pion mass . while chiral perturbation theory is only expected to be convergent at quite low pion mass  @xcite , in order to relate the simulations at large quark mass to experimental data ,",
    "the lattice data has been extrapolated using covariant and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory with dimensional regularization ",
    "e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .    based on the observation that _ all _",
    "hadron properties show a slow , smooth variation with quark mass above @xmath8gev , suggesting that chiral corrections ( pion loops ) are strongly suppressed there  @xcite , an alternative regularization method , namely finite - range - regularization ( frr ) has also been used to extrapolate the lattice data .",
    "it was first applied in the extrapolation of nucleon mass and magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "the remarkably improved convergence properties of the frr expansion mean that lattice data at large pion mass can be described very well and the obtained nucleon mass at physical pion mass is close to the experimental value .",
    "later , the frr method was applied to extrapolate the vector meson mass , nucleon magnetic moments , form factors , charge radii and strange form factors  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that frr has the unique advantage that it provides a natural connection between physical results and quenched lattice data  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the low moments of the gpds .",
    "the lhpc lattice data will be used as input for the extrapolation . the contribution from the disconnected quark loops",
    "has not been included in the lattice qcd simulation , which means that part of the sea quark contribution has been omitted  @xcite . while this contribution cancels in the isovector moments it could be very important in the isoscalar moments .",
    "extensive investigation of other nucleon properties suggests that this omission might be more important at the physical quark mass than at the relatively heavy masses where the lattice calculations were made  @xcite .",
    "if this were the case , the chiral extrapolation , which _ does _ include contributions from disconnected diagrams , may yield a reasonable representation of the physical values , even for isoscalar quantities .",
    "this is indeed the case for the octet magnetic moments  @xcite , for example .",
    "on the other hand , we are unable to quantify the error associated with this procedure for isoscalar quantities and in future it would clearly be preferable to be able to work with lattice simulations which include the disconnected contributions .",

    "therefore , we have carried out another fit with a modified dipole form .",
    "the @xmath96 dependence of the first moments , i.e. eq .  ( [ vfixm ] ) , is now changed to the following expression : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is chosen to be 1 gev . while a pure dipole form would be prefered phenomenologically , we note that the data from ref .",
    "@xcite tends to give much harder form factors for the axial channel than those found in nature .",
    "the reason for this is not understood but our modified form allows room to fit the lattice data while still including some physically reasonable @xmath96 dependence .",
    "we show the momentum dependence of @xmath169 and @xmath156 at @xmath166 mev in fig .  8 and fig .  9 . as a comparison ,",
    "the solid and dashed lines with the previous linear fit are also shown .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to the fit with the modified dipole form at tree level .",
    "the lattice data can be reasonably described with both forms . for @xmath154 ,",
    "compared with the linear fit , the dipole fit gives a larger value at @xmath124 .",
    "the situation is similar for the other pion masses .",
    "the curve of mass dependence of @xmath154 in fig .  6",
    "is shifted up in the dipole fit . as a result ,",
    "the moment at the physical mass is increased from 0.433 to 0.53 . for @xmath151",
    ", the difference between two fits is not as large as for @xmath154 .",
    "this is because the lattice data for @xmath169 at @xmath124 impose a strong constraint in that case . at the physical pion mass ,",
    "its value changes from 0.156 to 0.17 .",
    "the dipole fit makes the absolute value of all the first moments larger at @xmath124 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the difference is about @xmath170 with the help of the lattice data at zero momentum . for @xmath61 and @xmath147 ,",
    "the difference is about @xmath171 .",
    "the value of @xmath172 is still around zero .",
    "the difference between these two separate fitting procedures provides some indication of the systematic error in extracting this important physical information from the lattice data .",
    "chiral perturbation theory with finite - range - regularization has been applied to the problem of extrapolating lattice qcd data for gpd moments to the physical pion mass and zero momentum transfer . for the isovector form factors ,",
    "the one loop contribution is of @xmath137 . for the isoscalar form factors , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , the leading order is of @xmath137 , while for @xmath175 , the leading order is of @xmath136 .",
    "the lattice data were fitted both globally and separately at each pion mass . at @xmath124 , the @xmath135 dependence of the first moments ( except @xmath175 )",
    "does not show a big degree of curvature at small pion mass , which is quite different from the zero - th moments ( electromagnetic form factors ) .",
    "overall the level of agreement between the extrapolated results obtained using dimensional regularization and frr is satisfactory .    the @xmath96 dependence , especially of @xmath61 , is mainly determined by the tree level @xmath96 behavior . in our first calculation , we retained only the tree level terms up to @xmath96 , that is a linear dependence . on the other hand ,",
    "the data has been determined over a wide range of @xmath96 , up to 1.2 gev@xmath133 .",
    "phenomenlogically one knows that the physical form factors exhibit a considerable variation with @xmath96 over such a range  usually described by a dipole form . in order to test the sensitivity to this problem",
    ", we have re - done the fits to the lattice data using a modified dipole form . in this case",
    "the first moments at @xmath124 are about @xmath165 larger than those in the linear fit .",
    "we regard this as a measure of one of the main systematic errors associated with extracting information about the quark angular momentum .    in our calculation , the @xmath49 contributions have been included explicitly , because of its potential importance for spin dependent quantities .",
    "for the nucleon spin , the inclusion of the @xmath49 changes the result by @xmath170  @xcite .",
    "however , for the extrapolation of the first moments of gpds , if the @xmath49 is not included the low energy constants are different . since they are adjusted by fitting the lattice data , the extrapolated moments at the physical pion mass change by less than about @xmath176 when the @xmath49 is included .",
    "using the extrapolated moment @xmath61 , we can extract information concerning the quark contribution to the nucleon spin .",
    "our results are consistent with the current jlab and hermes experiments @xcite . on the other hand , the experimental errors there are quite large at the present time . the comparison with model predictions , such as those of refs .",
    "@xcite , is also quite satisfactory , especially given the systematic errors associated with the @xmath96 dependence of @xmath61 ( discussed above ) and the dependence of the proton axial charge on lattice volume . as for the other two moments ,",
    "the @xmath150 quark contribution is twice as large as that for the @xmath53 quark in @xmath60 , while they give similar contributions to @xmath62 . in comparing with data , it is important to note the possible sensitivity of isoscalar quantities to disconnected graphs which were not included in the lhpc simulation . in the next few years",
    "we can look forward not only to more accurate data on gpds but lattice qcd data on larger volumes and at lower quark masses and , ideally , including disconnected terms .",
    "all of this offers enormous promise towards unravelling the proton spin problem .",
