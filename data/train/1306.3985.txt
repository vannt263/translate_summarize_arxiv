    "three decades of increasingly precise measurements , culminating most recently with those from the planck satellite @xcite , have all shown consistency with the simplest single - field slow - roll ( sfsr ) models of inflation @xcite .",
    "still , many questions about the new physics responsible for inflation remain , and a number of further predictions of inflation remain to be tested .",
    "one of these predictions is a stochastic background of gravitational waves , or tensor metric perturbations @xcite .",
    "efforts are now underway to detect these tensor modes in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization @xcite , and there are prospects for direct detection of the background @xcite",
    ".    there may , however , also be an imprint of tensor modes in the observed cosmic mass distribution .",
    "one possible observable is the distortion induced by gravitational lensing by tensor modes to the galaxy distribution @xcite , the cmb @xcite or the 21-cm background @xcite .",
    "another possibility  which we focus upon here  is that long - wavelength tensor perturbations may lead to a quadrupolar power asymmetry in the power spectra for scalar perturbations .",
    "the idea is simple : tensor modes with wavelengths longer than the distance over which observations are done give rise to a quadrupolar distortion to the spacetime over the observed volume .",
    "this quadrupole may then ( a ) get imprinted somehow in the _ primordial _ mass distribution and/or ( b ) induce a quadrupole in the _ observed _ distribution through projection effects .",
    "such a quadrupole could then be sought , for example , in the cosmic microwave background @xcite or in galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "in fact , null searches for power asymmetries have already been carried out in galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "a tentative detection in the cmb @xcite was later disputed ; current measurements place upper limits @xcite at the level of @xmath0 on the amplitude of a power quadrupole .",
    "one might think that the amplitude of the power asymmetry would be large .",
    "for example , in standard sfsr inflation , the contribution to the square of the local tensor - perturbation amplitude is equal across each logarithmic interval of tensor wavelength .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the local quadrupolar distortion then scales with total number of @xmath1-folds of inflation , and this number could conceivably be large .",
    "an explicit calculation of the scalar - scalar - tensor power quadrupole @xcite , based upon the sfsr scalar - scalar - tensor bispectrum @xcite , seems to show such an infrared divergence .",
    "an upper limit on the power asymmetry would then translate into an upper bound to the duration of inflation .",
    "roughly speaking , the power quadrupole obtained this way is @xmath2 , instead of @xmath3 for tensor modes . ]",
    "where @xmath4 is the number of @xmath1-folds , and @xmath5 is the typical amplitude for a given fourier mode of the tensor field in terms of the energy density @xmath6 during inflation and the planck mass @xmath7 .",
    "a conservative current upper limit of @xmath8 for the power quadrupole @xcite then translates to @xmath9 .    on second",
    "thought , there are several reasons to question this result .",
    "first of all , it seems strange that observables within our horizon ( which is contained within the last @xmath10 @xmath1-folds of inflation ) could be probing physics on scales many orders of magnitude beyond the observable horizon .",
    "this becomes even clearer when we realize that as the tensor wavenumber @xmath11 , a given fourier mode of the tensor field approaches a constant tensor perturbation @xmath12 to the metric .",
    "however , the coordinates in a metric with a constant tensor @xmath12 can always be re - scaled to give a friedman - robertson - walker metric . in other words",
    ", observables only depend on ( at least two ) spacetime derivatives , @xmath13 , of the tensor metric perturbation @xmath12 .",
    "true , a perturbation of arbitrarily long wavelength was presumably within the horizon at some sufficiently early time during inflation .",
    "but again , it seems strange that observables within our horizon would depend on asymptotically early times during inflation .",
    "these arguments thus suggest that the infrared divergence in the power quadrupole is a gauge artifact .    since maldacena s paper  @xcite on three - point functions in inflation , a large literature ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) has clarified that analogous divergences that arise from the squeezed limit of the scalar - scalar - scalar bispectrum are gauge artifacts .",
    "@xcite point out that the only effect of the squeezed - limit bispectrum in terms of the global synchronous - gauge coordinates used in ref .",
    "@xcite is a constant coordinate transform into the local fermi normal coordinates ( fnc ) .",
    "@xcite splits perturbations into small- and long - wavelength modes and absorbs the latter into the background . ref .",
    "@xcite defines genuine gauge - invariant variables , whose bispectrum explicitly vanishes in the squeezed limit .",
    "while there are some differences ( to be expanded upon below ) , many of those arguments apply to the squeezed limit of the scalar - scalar - tensor bispectrum . as clarified most recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also below , the divergence in the primordial power quadrupole from the scalar - scalar - tensor bispectrum is canceled precisely by projection effects induced by the tensor perturbation at late times .",
    "we show here , however , that there still remains in sfsr inflation , after these divergences cancel , a nonzero but finite quadrupolar asymmetry in the observed _ local _ power spectrum . here _ local _ means that the power spectrum is measured within a patch smaller than the wavelength of the tensor mode .",
    "we focus on here should not be confused with the quadrupolar component ( @xmath14 ) of some two - dimensional angular power spectrum @xmath15 . ] while the switch , employed in previous work @xcite , to fnc coordinates right after inflation suffices to demonstrate the cancellation of divergences , it fails to account for the effects of spatial and temporal variations of tensor perturbations @xcite .",
    "both fnc and the peak - background split are only valid locally and hence introduce ambiguities for finite fourier wavelengths . in this paper",
    "we therefore work with global frw coordinates but define observables in a physical way . for simplicity ,",
    "we first derive rigorous results for a post - inflation universe filled with non - relativistic matter .",
    "we then argue heuristically , but without a complete calculation , that the power quadrupole induced by tensor modes of the smaller wavelengths that enter the horizon during radiation domination should be suppressed .",
    "the calculation presented here thus applies to tensor modes outside the horizon and to modes within the horizon today but that entered the horizon during matter domination ( i.e. , with wavelengths @xmath16 ) .",
    "this allows us to account for the epoch of radiation domination that precedes matter domination .",
    "dark energy dominates only at very late times and thus plays a marginal role on the power quadrupole .",
    "it does affect the mapping between source redshift and comoving distance though . with these insights ,",
    "we are able to generalize our results and make contact with our universe .",
    "our work expands upon previous work @xcite , which also suggested a finite effect on the observed power spectrum that grows logarithmically with time , by making precise the prediction for _ observable _ quantities .",
    "our calculation shows that the observable power asymmetry depends on spacetime derivatives of the tensor perturbation , rather than just its amplitude . as a result ,",
    "the contribution from a given superhorizon mode to the observable power asymmetry is suppressed by a factor @xmath17 relative to the naive calculation .",
    "thus , local observables are not sensitive to inflationary tensor modes with arbitrarily long wavelength .",
    "our conclusion is based on three considerations : ( 1 ) the squeezed primordial scalar - scalar - tensor bispectrum satisfies the single - field consistency relation [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : sst - consistency - relation ] ) below ] ; ( 2 ) throughout the expansion history after inflation , nonlinear mode couplings between long - wavelength tensor perturbations and short - wavelength scalar perturbations take effect ; ( 3 ) the positions at which we correlate matter / galaxy overdensities are specified in a _ physical _ way , e.g. by the _ observed _ redshifts and the _ observed _ angular position on the sky .",
    "we then find that the observable power quadrupole is induced at any given time predominantly by tensor perturbations with wavelengths comparable to the horizon at that time , as it should be . while the amplitude @xmath18 ( rather than @xmath19 ) of the resulting quadrupolar power asymmetry is too small to be observable today , it is important conceptually to note that the power asymmetry exists .",
    "we also note that in models where the self - consistency relation is violated  @xcite ,  the power quadrupole could conceivably be far larger",
    ". a null detection can thus constrain such alternative models .",
    "conversely , detection of a power quadrupole would rule out sfsr inflation .",

    "<S> inflationary models predict a correlation between primordial density perturbations ( scalar metric perturbations ) and gravitational waves ( tensor metric perturbations ) in the form of a scalar - scalar - tensor three - point correlation , or bispectrum in fourier space . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezed limit of this bispectrum implies a quadrupolar asymmetry in the observed local power spectrum for matter and galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> here we show ( like others before ) that an infrared divergence in the amplitude of this power asymmetry predicted in single - field slow - roll models is canceled by projection effects when considering the observed power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we then further evaluate the nonzero , but finite , residual quadrupolar power asymmetry that remains after the divergences are canceled . while the quadrupolar power asymmetry is small , it is conceptually important . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation moreover clarifies how the predictions for this power asymmetry may change in models with different scalar - scalar - tensor bispectra , and shows that convincing detection of the quadrupolar power asymmetry would rule out the single - field slow - roll models of inflation . </S>"
