    "the solar wind outflow presents a major challenge to numerical modeling since it is a fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) , time - dependent physical environment , where regions of supersonic and subsonic speeds coexist in a tenuous , magnetized plasma .",
    "ulysses observations ( mccomas et al .",
    "@xcite ) highlighted again that the solar wind about the ecliptic plane is fundamentally dynamic in nature , while the fast speed wind across both solar poles is on the whole stationary and uniform .",
    "recent soho measurements ( hassler et al .",
    "@xcite ) demonstrated how the fast wind emanating from coronal holes is rooted to the ` honeycomb ' structure of the chromospheric magnetic network , making the outflow truly 3d , while the daily coronal mass ejections are in essence highly time - varying .",

    "their magnetic topology shows both open ( polar ) and closed ( equatorial ) field line regions . when heating the closed field region , a sharp streamer - like cusp forms at its tip as the region continuously expands and evaporates . a quasi - stationary wind model results where the emphasis is on reaching a qualitative and quantitative agreement with the observed latitudinal variation ( reproducing , in particular , the sharp transition at roughly @xmath0 latitude between fast and slow solar wind ) by tuning the spatial dependence of the artificial volumetric heating and momentum sources",
    "we follow another route towards global solar wind modeling , working our way up stepwise from stationary 1d to 3d mhd configurations . in a pure ideal , stationary , axisymmetric mhd approach",
    ", numerical simulations can benefit greatly from analytical theory .",
    "this is demonstrated in ustyugova et al .",

    "( @xcite ) modeling efforts to 2.5d , by including toroidal vector components while remaining axisymmetric .",
    "this allows us to explore stellar wind regimes where rotation is also important .",
    "the magnetic field still has open and closed field line regions , but in ideal mhd , the closed field region is a ` dead ' zone from where no plasma can escape .",
    "the unknown coronal heating is avoided by assuming a polytropic equation of state and dropping the energy equation all together .",
    "the stationary , axisymmetric , polytropic mhd models are analysed as in ustyugova et al .",

    "the advantages of a gradual approach towards such ` final ' model were pointed out in keppens & goedbloed ( @xcite ) . there",

    "all obtained with the versatile advection code ( vac , see tth  @xcite ; tth & keppens  @xcite ; keppens & tth  @xcite , and http://www.phys.uu.nl/toth ) , we demonstrated that we can now routinely calculate axisymmetric magnetized wind solutions for ( differentially ) rotating stars .",
    "an important generalization of previous modeling efforts ( sakurai  @xcite ) is that the field topology can have both open and closed field line regions , so we model ` wind ' and ` dead ' zones self - consistently .",
    "in essence , our work extends the early model efforts by pneuman & kopp ( @xcite ) in ( i ) going from an isothermal to a polytropic equation of state ; ( ii ) allowing for stellar rotation ; and ( iii ) including time - dependent phenomena .",

    "the largest deviations are apparent at the rotation axis ( symmetry axis ) in @xmath99 , which is not unexpected due to its @xmath100 dependence .",
    "other inconsistencies are in the region which has drastically changed from its initial zero velocity , purely dipole magnetic field structure : open field lines coming from the polar regions are now draped around a dipolar ` dead ' zone of limited radial extent .",

    "in fact , a dip in the density variation was present due to an active region situated above the equator .",
    "qualitatively , we recover this variation at the boundary of the dead zone .",

    "the other two radial cuts situated beyond the dead zone agree quite well with the conclusions drawn by the observational study .",
    "the reference wind solution also conforms with some well - known studies in mhd wind modeling .",

    "their base number density was imposed to be @xmath121 , independent of latitude , and they assumed a slightly higher value for the mean molecular weigth , namely @xmath122 .",
    "this leads to a base density which is a factor of 2.246 higher than the one used in our model . with these differences in mind ( together with our polytropic equation of state and the rotational effects ) , we show in the right panel of fig .",

    "the final base field strength turns out to be of roughly the same magnitude , but differs in its detailed latitudinal variation .",
    "the changes in the gobal wind pattern are qualified by the resulting deformations of the critical surfaces ( hourglass curves ) where the wind speed equals the slow , alfvn , and fast speeds .",

    "if we keep the dead zone small , but double the initial field strength @xmath58 ( from a to c ) , the opposite behaviour occurs : the critical curves , hence the entire acceleration behaviour of the wind , become much more anisotropic .",
    "the most pronounced change is an inward shift of the polar slow transition , and an outward shift of the alfvn and fast polar transition .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with what a weber - davis model ( weber & davis  @xcite ) predicts to happen when the field strength is increased ( note that the weber - davis model only applies to the equatorial region ) . when both the field strength and the dead zone are doubled ( from a to d ) , the resulting alfvn and fast critical curves are rather isotropic due to the influence of the dead zone .",
    "the polar slow transition is displaced inward while the polar alfvn and fast curve are shifted outward , as expected for the higher field .",
    "the detailed equatorial behaviour is clearly modulated by the existing dead zone .",
    "we note that all wind solutions presented are still thermally driven , since the solar - like rotation rate is rather low and the field strengths are very modest .",
    "the changes are entirely due to reasonable variations in magnetic field topology and only a factor of two in field strength .",

    "thereby , it also leads to streamline bending , both poleward as clearly seen in the high latitude field lines , and equatorwards in the vicinity of the stellar surface . in this way , the magnetic topology consisting of a dead and a wind zone , combined with fast rotation , leads to magnetically dominated collimation along the stellar poles , together with magneto - rotational deflections along the equator .",
    "the latter leads to enhanced densities in the equatorial plane .",
    "figure  [ f - rotcuts ] shows the radial dependence at a polar angle @xmath146 of the radial velocity @xmath147 , sound speed @xmath148 , radial alfvn speed @xmath149 , and azimuthal speed @xmath150 .",
    "note that the radial velocity reaches up to @xmath151 ( compare with the @xmath152 velocities reached under solar conditions as shown in fig .",
    "[ f - cuts ] ) , as a result of the additional centrifugal acceleration .",
    "the rotation plays a significant dynamical role here , in contrast to the ` solar - like ' models discussed earlier and displayed in fig .",
    "[ f - winds ] .",
    "the toroidal speed @xmath150 reaches above @xmath153 , a factor of @xmath134 higher than along the ecliptic as shown in fig .",
    "[ f - cuts ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the corotation obtained by the numerical procedure to find the stationary state can again be quantified by the relative error @xmath154 : the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ f - rotcuts ] proves that it is less than 3 % along that same radial cut .",
    "in the process of generating a stationary wind solution , various dynamic phenomena take place which may have physical relevance .",
    "for instance , the equatorial conic section delineated by @xmath155 $ ] which was initially static ( @xmath156 ) and dipolar throughout , first gets ` invaded ' by plasma emanating from the wind zone .",
    "the open field structure is dragged in towards the equator , and most of the dipolar field is moved out of the domain , except for the remaining ` dead ' zone .",
    "one could qualitatively relate some of these changes in the global magnetic topology with observed coronal phenomena .",
    "in reality however , coronal mass ejections represent major disturbances which happen on top of the stationary transonic solar wind .",
    "they are associated with sudden , significant mass loss and cause violent disruptions of the global field pattern .",
    "most notably , one frequently observes the global coronal wind structure to return to its previous stationary state , after the passage of the cme . within the realms of our stellar wind models , we can trigger cmes on top of the outflow pattern , study their motion , and at the same time demonstrate that the numerical solutions indeed are stable to such violent perturbations by returning to a largely unchanged stationary state .",
    "we still restrict ourselves to axisymmetric calculations , so the geometry of our ` cme ' events is rather artificial . in future work , we intend to model these cmes in their true 3d setting .    as background",
    "stellar wind , we use a slightly modified model b from the previous section .",
    "model b had a large dead zone , @xmath51 , @xmath48 , and a rigid rotation with @xmath31 corresponding to @xmath157 .",
    "we changed the boundary condition on @xmath150 to mimick a ` solar - like ' differential rotation , by taking @xmath158 with @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .",
    "this enforces the equator to rotate faster than the poles in accord with the observations .",
    "as expected for this low rotation rate , this has no significant influence on the wind acceleration pattern .",
    "the coronal mass ejection is an equally straigthforward modification of the boundary condition imposed on the poloidal momentum equation , namely @xmath162 with @xmath163 for @xmath164 and @xmath165 , and otherwise @xmath166 the wind related mass loss rate @xmath167 contains the polar angle dependence due to the dead zone , as before .",
    "the extra four parameters control the magnitude of the cme mass loss rate @xmath168 , the duration @xmath169 , and the location @xmath170 and extent @xmath171 in polar angle for the mass ejection .",
    "we only present one cme scenario for parameter values @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 .",
    "note that the up - down symmetry is hereby deliberately broken .",
    "this scenario mimicks a mass ejection which detaches from the coronal base within 45 minutes and which has an associated mass flux of about @xmath176 .",
    "in fact , the total amount of mass lost due to the cme can be evaluated from @xmath177 for the chosen parameter values , this works out to be @xmath178 , corresponding to @xmath179 , a typical value for a violent event .",
    "figure  [ f - cme1 ] shows the density difference between the evolving mass ejection and the background stellar wind at left , the magnetic field structure ( middle ) , and the toroidal velocity component @xmath180 ( right ) at times @xmath181 ( 1hr 27 after onset ) and @xmath182 ( 4hr 20 after onset ) .",
    "the region is plotted up to @xmath183 .",
    "although the event is triggered in the upper quadrant dead zone only , its violent character also disturbs the overlying open field ( or wind ) zone . the added plasma , trapped in the dead zone , even perturbs the lower quadrant wind zone at later times .",
    "note that the cme induces global , abrupt changes in the toroidal velocity component .",
    "the outermost closed field lines get stretched out radially , pulling the dead zone along ( see fig .  [ f - cme1]-[f - cme2 ] ) . in ideal mhd calculations",
    ", they can never detach through reconnection , although numerical diffusion can cause it to happen .",
    "we observed the outermost field lines of the dead zone to travel outwards without noticable reconnection .",
    "the overall wind pattern in the first 15 base radii thereby approximately returns to its original stationary state , as shown in figure  [ f - cme2 ] which gives the solution at @xmath184 ( 7hr 13 after onset ) and @xmath185 ( more than 43 hrs after onset ) .",
    "figure  [ f - cmeis ] shows how a hypothetical spacecraft at @xmath186 , close to the ecliptic , would record the cme - passage as a sudden increase in density and poloidal velocity which eventually relax to their pre - event levels .",
    "the event is followed by an increased azimuthal flow regime and shows large amplitude oscillations in magnetic field strength and orientation .",
    "as we assumed axisymmetry , this simulation serves as a crude model for cme - type phenomena .",
    "interestingly , axisymmetric numerical simulations of toroidal flux ` belts ' launched from within the dead zone of a purely meridional , polytropic mhd wind can relate favourably to satellite magnetic cloud measurements at 1au ( wu et al .",
    "@xcite ) . note that we triggered a ` cme ' by prescribing a time and space dependent mass flux at the stellar base , where the density and the magnetic field components could adjust freely .",
    "alternatively , as used in studies by miki & linker  ( @xcite ) , global coronal restructuring can be triggered by shearing a coronal arcade .",
    "parameter studies of axisymmetric , but ultimately 3d solutions , could investigate the formation and appearance of various mhd shock fronts depending on plasma beta , mach numbers , etc .",
    "continuing our gradual approach towards dynamic stellar wind simulations in three dimensions , we studied the influence of the magnetic field strength and topology ( allowing for wind and dead zones ) , of the stellar rotation , and of sudden mass ejecta on axisymmetric mhd winds .",
    "we demonstrated how reasonable changes in the coronal magnetic field ( factor of two in field strength and in dead zone extent ) influence the detailed acceleration behaviour of the wind .",
    "larger dead zones cause effective , fairly isotropic acceleration to super - alfvnic velocities since the polar , open field lines are forced to fan out rapidly with radial distance .",
    "the alfvn transition moves outwards when the coronal field strength increases .",
    "the equatorial wind outflow is in these models sensitive to the presence and extent of the dead zone , but has , by construction , a vanishing @xmath187 and a @xmath188 zone from the tip of the dead zone to large radial distances .",
    "the parameter values for these models are solar - like , hence the winds are mostly thermally driven and , in particular , emanated from slowly rotating stars .",
    "for a twenty times faster than solar rotation rate , the wind structure changes dramatically , with a clear separation of the alfvn and fast magnetosonic critical curves . at these rotation rates ,",
    "a pure hydrodynamic model predicts equatorward streamline bending from higher latitudes .",
    "our mhd models show how this is now mediated by the dipolar dead zone .",
    "an equatorial belt of enhanced density stretches from above the dead zone outwards , where effective thermo - centrifugally driven outflow occurs .",
    "the magnetic field structure shows signs of a strong poleward collimation , due to the significant toroidal field pressure build up at these spin rates . as pointed out by tsinganos & bogovalov ( @xcite )",
    ", this situation could apply to our own sun in an earlier evolutionary phase .",
    "it could be of interest to make more quantitative parameter studies of the interplay between field topology , rotation rate , etc . in order to apprehend transonic stellar outflows driven by combinations of thermal , magnetic , and centrifugal forces .",
    "a systematic study of the angular momentum loss rates as a function of dead zone extent , magnetic field strength , and rotation rate can aid in stellar rotational evolution modeling ( keppens , charbonneau , & mcgregor  @xcite ; keppens  @xcite ) . specifically , li ( @xcite ) pointed out that the present solar magnetic breaking rate is consistent with either one of two magnetic topologies : ( i ) one with the standard coronal field strength of @xmath83 1 @xmath189 and a small @xmath190 dead zone ; or ( ii ) one with a larger @xmath83 5 @xmath189 dipole strength and a sizeable dead zone .",
    "when we calculate the torque exerted on the star by the magnetized winds a , b , c and d shown in fig .",
    "[ f - winds ] as @xmath191 ( noting the axi- and up - down symmetry ) , we find @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .",
    "this confirms li s result , since a simultaneous doubling of the coronal field strength and the dead zone extent ( from model a to d ) hardly changes the torque magnitude . as could be expected , only enlarging the dead zone lowers the breaking efficiency ( as pointed out in solanki , motamen , & keppens  @xcite ) , while only raising the field strength leads to faster spin - down .",
    "interestingly , a weber - davis prediction with governing parameters identical to the reference model a ( as presented in keppens & goedbloed  @xcite ) gives a value @xmath196 ( all quantities evaluated at the alfvn radius @xmath197 ) , one order of magnitude larger !",
    "the same conclusion was reached by priest & pneuman ( @xcite ) by estimating the angular momentum loss rate from the purely meridional pneuman & kopp ( @xcite ) model . although the latter model does not include rotation ( so that @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ q - tor ] ) is strictly zero for this model ) , priest & pneuman ( @xcite ) could estimate the torque for a solar rotation rate from the obtained variation of the poloidal alfvn radius as a function of latitude ( our fig .",
    "[ f - new ] , right panel ) .",
    "the resulting estimate was only 15  % of that for a monopole base field .",
    "our exactly evaluated spin - down rates are 2.6  % to 10.3  % of a split - monopole case .",
    "the large difference arises due to the presence of the dead zone and the fact that @xmath187 vanishes across the equator for the wind solutions from fig .",
    "[ f - winds ] . indeed , evaluating the torque from eq .",
    "[ q - tor ] for the monopolar wind solution from keppens & goedbloed  ( @xcite , figure  4 ) gives @xmath198 , in agreement with the weber - davis estimate .",
    "hence , it should be clear that full mhd modeling is a useful tool to further evaluate and constrain different magnetic braking mechanisms .",
    "we showed how cme events can be simulated on top of these transonic outflows .",
    "the detailed wind structure is stable to violent mass dumps , even when ejected in the dead zone .",
    "note that we restricted ourselves to axisymmetric perturbations , and it will be of interest to show whether the axisymmetric solutions are similarly stable to non - axisymmetric perturbations ( as recently investigated for shocked accretion flows on compact objects in molteni , tth , & kuznetsov  @xcite ) .",
    "one could then focus on truly 3d mass ejecta and their parametric dependence ( possibly allow for direct comparison with lasco observations of coronal mass ejections ) , or even experiment with unaligned rotation and magnetic axes .",
    "a 3d time - dependent analytic model by gibson & low ( @xcite ) can be used as a further check on the numerics .",
    "alternatively , we may decide to zoom in on ( 3d ) details of the wind structure at the boundaries of open and closed field line regions or about the ecliptic plane , to see whether shear flow driven kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ( keppens et al .",
    "@xcite ; keppens & tth  @xcite ) develop in these regions .",
    "the versatile advection code was developed as part of the project on ` parallel computational magneto - fluid dynamics ' , funded by the dutch science foundation ( nwo ) priority program on massively parallel computing , and coordinated by jpg .",
    "computer time on the cray c90 was sponsored by the dutch ` stichting nationale computerfaciliteiten ' ( ncf ) .",
