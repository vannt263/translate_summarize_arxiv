    "a system of laser - cooled ions immersed in an ultracold atomic gas introduces a new experimental degree of freedom , a charge , into cold atom experiments @xcite",
    ". a single ultracold ion would be useful as a local probe of an ultracold atomic cloud with high spatial resolution , since ions can be controlled using an electric field without exerting much influence on the atoms @xcite .",
    "a system of several crystalized ions mixed with neutral atoms would nicely model atomic cores comprising lattice mixed with an electron gas in a solid - state material @xcite .",
    "the charge of the ions would activate the atoms and ions to chemical reactions , and therefore the atom - ion hybrid system would make an ideal platform to study chemical reactions at a single atom level .",
    "when atoms and ions are trapped together , the ions attract the atoms by their static electric field and sometimes lead to inelastic collisions .",
    "so far , charge - exchange collisions either with or without emission of radiation @xcite and molecular association due to radiative processes @xcite or three - body collisions @xcite have been studied in ultracold atom - ion hybrid systems .",
    "a systematic study of such inelastic collisions , which are elementary chemical reaction processes , is essential to realize the full quantum control of the chemical reactions in an ultralow temperature regime .",
    "the knowledge of the molecular interaction potentials and the potential couplings is important for understanding such chemical reactions .",
    "the experimental characterization of the ultracold inelastic collisions under the precise control of the collision energies and the internal states of the reacting atoms and ions allows for testing the interaction potentials which are obtained from the elaborated quantum chemistry calculations .    in this article",
    ", we systematically study the energy dependence and the internal - state dependence of the charge - exchange cross sections in an ultracold @xmath0li@xmath1ca@xmath2 mixture .",
    "our choice of the atom - ion combination is unique and promising for the observation of quantum collisions since the @xmath0li@xmath1ca@xmath2 combination has a high s - wave threshold energy of 10  @xmath3k and a quite low limit of micromotion - induced heating rate of a few microkelvin per second  @xcite .",
    "the collision energy in our measurement ranges from 0.2  mk to 1  k , spanning nearly four orders of magnitude . to control the collision energies",
    "precisely , we deliberately excite an excess ion micromotion in a linear paul trap .",
    "we determine the energy of the ions from the micromotion - modulated fluorescence spectra @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the charge - exchange cross section @xmath4 is scaled with the energy - dependent langevin cross section @xmath5 and the cross section can be expressed as @xmath6 .",
    "the factor @xmath7 describes the probability of undergoing the charge - exchange collision reflecting the details of the potential mixing of the incoming and outgoing channels .",

    "we also performed the calculation of the lica@xmath2 potential energy curves , and from the comparison between the experimental results with theory calculations , we have identified the route of the charge - exchange collisions . a profound understanding of the interaction potentials is an important step to predict the route for the molecular ion formation , which may allow us to realize the creation of translationally cold molecules composed of large number of atoms , and to reveal the physics of the growth of mesoscopic molecular ions @xcite .",
    "in our experiment , @xmath0li atoms and @xmath12 ions were trapped and cooled separately in a different part of a vacuum chamber as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : system ] . after the preparation of the atoms and the ions ,",
    "the atoms were transferred to the center between the ion trap electrodes using an optical tweezer , and mixed with the ions .",
    "the ions were trapped by a conventional linear paul trap with an rf voltage with amplitude 44  v and frequency @xmath13  @xmath14 , realizing the radial and the axial trap frequencies of @xmath15  khz , respectively .",
    "neutral @xmath16 atoms from the oven were photoionized using 423  nm and 375  nm lasers .",
    "then the ions were cooled with a 397  nm laser , whose frequency was red - detuned from the @xmath17 transition and with a 866  nm laser , as a repump light , tune to the resonance of the @xmath18 transition .",
    "fluorescence from the ions was detected by a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and an electron multiplying ccd ( emccd ) camera .",
    "the ion trap system included compensation electrodes to minimize the excess micromotion of the trapped ions .",
    "minimization of the micromotion was accomplished by the rf photon correlation method , and the residual micromotion energy at the optimum condition was estimated to be @xmath19 0.2 @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 atoms were first trapped by a conventional magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and then transferred into a cavity - enhanced optical dipole trap ( odt ) @xcite . eventually , they were transferred into a single optical dipole trap created by a 1064  nm laser @xcite .",
    "then , the atoms were transported to the position of the ion trap to create the atom - ion mixture by moving one lens placed on the translation stage .",
    "the trap frequencies for the atoms were 670  hz in the radial direction and 1.7  hz in the axial direction .",
    "the peak density of the atoms was @xmath22  @xmath23 .",
    "the temperature of the @xmath21 atoms was @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath21 was prepared in the ground hyperfine state @xmath26 of @xmath27 when they were mixed with the @xmath12 ions in the current experiment .",
    "we tune the energy of the ions by deliberately exciting the excess micromotion in a controlled way .",
    "we start from the condition in which the micromotion of the ions is well compensated , and then we apply an offset electric field to displace the ions in the radial direction ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions ) to intentionally add an excess micromotion energy to the ions .",
    "the added kinetic energy of the ions is determined from the shape of the ions fluorescence spectra .    when the micromotion is excited , the spectral shape gets broadened and deformed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](a ) . the spectral intensity @xmath30 can be described as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the laser detuning , the natural linewidth of the @xmath17 transition , and the electric dipole moment of the transition , respectively , and @xmath35 is the @xmath36-th order bessel function for @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath37 is the modulation index defined by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , is the wavenumber of the cooling laser , @xmath40 is the velocity of the ion along the direction of the micromotion ( namely @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions in our case ) , and @xmath41 is the angle of the propagation direction of the cooling laser to the @xmath28-@xmath29 plane , respectively . when @xmath42 , the bessel function can only be @xmath43 , and",
    "the spectral shape becomes a simple lorenz function .",
    "when @xmath37 has a finite value , the spectral shape is deformed and shows a peak around @xmath44 .",

    "the excess micromotion energy of the ion @xmath46 is determined by @xmath37 from the expression @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the mass of the ca@xmath2 ion .",
    "the total kinetic energy of the ca@xmath2 ion is @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the minimum energy we can reach in the optimum compensation condition of the micromotions .",
    "@xmath51 can in principle reach @xmath52  mk ( @xmath53 is the doppler limit ) , but the actual value is determined by the quality of the laser cooling .",
    "figure [ fig : energy](b ) illustrates the kinetic energy of the ion determined from the fluorescence spectra plotted against the applied offset electric field .",
    "the electric field is enforced by applying the voltage to the compensation electrode , and the electric field strength is calibrated through the displacement of the ions measured using the ccd camera .",
    "the plot shows the quadratic dependence of @xmath46 to the applied electric field which can be described as @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are an elementary charge , the applied electric field strength , and the stability parameter of the ion trap , respectively @xcite . from the fitting of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](b ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : quadratic ] ) by taking @xmath57 as a free parameter , we obtain @xmath58 from the data ( the dashed curve ) .",
    "the dashed curve is used to interpolate the data for the determination of the energy of the ion at the intermediate electric field strength .",
    "the collision energy is determined from the ion kinetic energy by @xmath59 , where @xmath3 is the reduced mass of the @xmath60 combination and @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , in ideal conditions , we can in principle reach the collision energy down to factor of eight smaller than the doppler limit of the ca@xmath62 ion only by the doppler cooling .",
    "the inelastic collisions that we observe in our system have been identified as charge - exchange collisions through the mass spectrometry of the reaction product ions in our previous work @xcite . in the current experiment ,",
    "three to seven ca@xmath2 ions are loaded in the ion trap to form a one - dimensional crystal .",
    "then ions are mixed with li atoms and held for one second , and we count the number of ions lost from the trap . within one second of the holding , the number of ions decays in time .",
    "we repeat the measurement 50 times and the ion - loss probability @xmath63 as a function of holding time is measured .",
    "we derive the charge - exchange collision rate @xmath64 from the solution of the rate equation which takes into account the radiative decay of the ion from the metastable @xmath10 and @xmath11 states , @xmath65 , where @xmath33 is the spontaneous decay rate of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states and @xmath66 is the mixing time of the atoms and ions @xcite",
    ". the energy - dependent charge - exchange collision cross section @xmath67 can be derived from the relation @xmath68 , where @xmath36 is the atomic density and @xmath69 is the mean relative velocity of the colliding atom and ion .",
    "the atomic density @xmath36 at the ion position is determined from the information on the number of atoms , the trap frequencies for the atoms , and the displacement of the ion position from the center of the atomic cloud .",
    "although an elastic collision between a li atom and a ca@xmath2 ion causes the loss of the atoms , the reducation of the number of atoms in the current experiment is negligible .",
    "the relative velocity of the li atom and the ca@xmath2 ion is determined solely by the velocity of the ion , since the velocity of the ion is much greater than the velocity of the atom .",
    "figure [ fig : cross](a ) shows the measured charge - exchange collision cross sections as a function of the collision energy @xmath70 for the @xmath71 ions under the irradiation of the cooling and repump lasers . in this condition ,",
    "ions are considered to be in the superposition state of the @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 states .",

    "since the charge - exchange collision happens when the atom - ion distance is very small , the charge - exchange collision is a part of the langevin collision and therefore @xmath77 is proportional to but smaller than @xmath78 .",
    "the energy dependence of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross](a ) is consistent with that of the langevin model in the collision energy range of our measurements .    in order to reveal the internal - state dependence of the charge - exchange collision",

    "the repump laser is turned off 20ms earlier than the cooling laser . to prepare the ion in the @xmath11 state",
    ", we turn off the repump laser and then the 850 nm laser that drives the ions from @xmath10 to @xmath79 is irradiated together with the cooling laser for 20 ms .",
    "the pumping of the ions is done just before the atoms are transported to the ion trap position .",
    "we have confirmed that the fluctuation of the transportation timing does not affect our measurement of the charge - exchange rate .",

    "in contrast to the case of ions under cooling lasers , ions prepared in the metastable @xmath80 state is not irradiated by the cooling lasers and therefore ions may be exposed to heating by an rf noise @xcite .",

    "we estimate the rate of the heating due to rf noise using the typical value of the spectral density from the power law , and it is estimated to be 70 mk / s for the geometric layout of our ion trap . since our measurement of the charge - exchange cross section may suffer from the heating due to the rf noise , we exclude the data of the collision energy less than 10 mk ( shown with the open markers in figs .

    "since the collision cross section for the mixed state is described as @xmath83 , @xmath7 coefficient for the @xmath9 state is determined from @xmath7 for the @xmath8 and @xmath10 states . as for the ions in the @xmath8 state , the charge - exchange collision rate is too small to be measured accurately in the current experiment .",
    "we have determined the upper limit of @xmath7 for the @xmath8 state to be @xmath84 which corresponds to our measurement limit of the smallest charge - exchange rate of @xmath85 s@xmath86 .",
    "the knowledge of the molecular properties of the lica@xmath2 system yields useful insight to interpret the results above .",
    "surprisingly enough , no information was available in the literature for this system up to now . following the approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculated the lica@xmath2 potential energy curves ( pecs ) for all symmetries up to the li(@xmath87)+ca@xmath2(@xmath88 ) dissociation limit , namely the 9@xmath89 asymptote .",
    "computing such highly - excited states is indeed easily tractable with our approach . generally speaking",
    ", a diatomic molecules composed of an alkali - metal atom and an alkaline - earth ion can be modeled as a system where the two valence electrons are moving in the field of the two ionic cores li@xmath2 and ca@xmath90 .",
    "the latter are represented by two effective core potentials which include core polarization effects .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the two valence electrons can then be solved in a configuration space spanned by a large gaussian basis set . with only two active electrons , a full configuration interaction",
    "can thus be achieved @xcite yielding ground state pec and numerous excited state pecs , displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : pec ] .",
    "in contrast with heavier systems like rbca@xmath2 or rbba@xmath2 @xcite , the lica@xmath2 species is light enough to allow accessing to the pecs up to li(@xmath87)+ca@xmath2(@xmath88 ) , thus representing an appealing species to sort out the complicated dynamics taking place in such a hybrid trap . assuming that only two - body reactions are expected in the present experimental conditions",
    ", one can immediately infer several statements allowing to understand the present experimental results .",
    "first there is a strong avoided crossing ( circled in fig .",
    "[ fig : pec ] ) between the ( 2)@xmath91 and the ( 3)@xmath91 pecs which is probably responsible for the large observed charge exchange rate in the li(@xmath87)+ca@xmath2(@xmath92 ) entrance channel .",
    "as it is well isolated from other curves , this avoided crossing can be linearized following the standard landau - zener approach , so that a single path transition probability can be estimated according to @xmath93 . in this expression the interaction strength parameter @xmath94  a.u .",
    "is half of the potential energy spacing between the two pecs at the crossing point located at @xmath95 ( @xmath96 is the bohr radius ) .",
    "the classical relative velocity @xmath97  a.u . at @xmath98 of the particles with reduced mass @xmath3",
    "is obtained through the value @xmath99  a.u . of the potential energy at @xmath98 with respect to the li(@xmath87)+ca@xmath2(@xmath92 ) , assuming a negligible incoming velocity at large distance .",
    "finally the @xmath100  a.u .",
    "is the difference of slopes between the two branches of the linearized crossing .",
    "all together we obtain @xmath101 which is large enough to explain the large observed charge exchange rate .",
    "note however that several further issues should be taken in account for a more quantitative estimate .",
    "first , assuming a statistical population of the initial molecular states , the ( 3)@xmath91 state would be populated with a weight of 3/20 . on the other hand",
    ", spin - orbit interaction probably plays a significant role in the dynamics ; in particular , the ( 2)@xmath102 , ( 1)@xmath103 and ( 1)@xmath104 state are expected to be efficiently coupled to the ( 3)@xmath91 state , so that the effective incoming flux toward the avoided crossing is probably higher than the one inferred by the statistical weight . moreover",
    ", the inclusion of the spin - orbit interaction in the model would allow to interpret the observed difference of rates for the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 states .",
    "the reported almost unmeasurable rate for the charge exchange reaction starting from the li(@xmath87)+ca@xmath2(@xmath105 ) entrance channel is also readily interpreted from the behavior of the pecs . just like in other similar species @xcite ,",
    "two molecular states are correlated to this asymptote , namely the ( 1)@xmath91 and the ( 2)@xmath106 .",
    "the former state is the lowest one in this symmetry so that only elastic collisions are expected in this channel .",
    "the latter state lies far above the lica@xmath2 electronic ground state so that no clear efficient avoided crossing is present",
    ". therefore the only possible two - body reaction proceeds through spontaneous emission , leading to either radiative charge exchange leading to two ground state species ( a li@xmath2 ion and a neutral ca atom ) , or to the formation of a ground state molecular ion lica@xmath2 as already reported in refs .",
    "following the method exposed in @xcite , we estimated that the cross section for these radiative processes is about 50 times smaller than the one calculated for rbca@xmath2 , namely smaller than 10@xmath107  @xmath108 .",
    "it is likely that this process could be observed provided that an improved detection using mass spectrometry is implemented .    finally , the situation is more involved for the li(@xmath87)+ca@xmath2(@xmath88 ) entrance channel .",
    "this asymptote is quite well isolated from neighboring ones so that there is no obvious avoided crossing in the relevant pecs .",
    "however we see that at almost vanishing initial energy ( see the horizontal dotted line in the figure ) the ( 5)@xmath102 pec crosses several curves correlated to lower asymptotes to which it can be coupled through spin - orbit interaction , thus allowing for efficient charge exchange .",
    "an estimate of the transition probability would require a model for the molecular spin - orbit for these states , and thus further quantum chemistry calculations which are out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "in conclusion , we have systematically studied the energy dependence and the internal - state dependence of the charge - exchange collision cross sections for the @xmath0li  @xmath1ca@xmath2 combination .",
    "the energy dependence is confirmed to be consistent with the langevin model in the collision energy range from 0.2  mk to 1  k. thanks to the relatively large atom - ion mass ratio , we have reached down to 0.2  mk only with the doppler cooling .",
    "this energy is only a factor of 20 higher than the s - wave threshold energy of 10  @xmath3k .",
    "it is confirmed that the collision energy in the current work is still in the classical langevin regime .",
    "the inelastic collision rate depends on which internal state the ions are prepared , and the direct comparison between experiment and theory enable us to pin down the route of the charge - exchange process and also to confirm the calculation result of the potential curves with the experiment .",
    "considering that the @xmath0li@xmath1ca@xmath2 combination has a quite low heating rate arising from a micromotion @xcite , the @xmath0li@xmath1ca@xmath2 combination is one of the most promising candidates to investigate the quantum collisions in an atom - ion hybrid system .",
    "the detailed understanding of the inelastic collisions and interaction potentials will be an important step toward the realization of the full quantum control of the elementaly processes of chemical reactions in an ultracold temperature regime .",

    "<S> we investigate the energy dependence and the internal - state dependence of the charge - exchange collision cross sections in a mixture of @xmath0li atoms and @xmath1ca@xmath2 ions in the collision energy range from 0.2 mk to 1 k. deliberately excited ion micromotion is used to control the collision energy of atoms and ions . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of the charge - exchange collision cross section obeys the langevin model in the temperature range of the current experiment , and the measured magnitude of the cross section is correlated to the internal state of the @xmath1ca@xmath2 ions . revealing the relationship between the charge - exchange collision cross sections and the interaction potentials is an important step toward the realization of the full quantum control of the chemical reactions at an ultralow temperature regime . </S>"
