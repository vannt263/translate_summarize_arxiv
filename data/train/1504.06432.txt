    "although the discovery of the standard model ( sm ) like higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite suggests that there is an isospin doublet scalar field in the higgs sector , the possibility of the existence more higgs doublets still remains open .",
    "in fact , a second doublet is often introduced in new physics models such as the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , models with a multi - doublet structure have also been discussed based upon various physics motivations , e.g. , to explain tiny neutrino masses via radiative generation  @xcite , to provide a dark matter ( dm ) candidate  @xcite and to supply extra cp violating phases  @xcite for the explanation of the baryon asymmetry of universe .",
    "thus , testing the existence of additional doublet fields is quite important to probe new physics scenarios beyond the sm .",
    "one of the most important features of models with multi - higgs doublets is the appearance of physical extra scalar bosons such as charged higgs bosons @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the properties of @xmath0 states strongly depend on the structure of the higgs sector , e.g. , the symmetries of the model , the actual number of doublets , the mass spectrum , etc .",
    "therefore , through the detection of @xmath0 and by measuring those properties , e.g. , the mass , couplings , production cross sections and decay rates , one can directly probe the existence of additional doublets as well attempt extracting the structure of the higgs sector .    among the various observables related to @xmath0 , studying",
    "the @xmath1 vertex is quite interesting because of the following features .",
    "firstly , it has been known that the @xmath1 vertex does not appear at the tree level vertex does also not appear at the tree level in any models with the @xmath13 symmetry . ] in multi - doublet models  @xcite , because of an approximate global @xmath14 symmetry known as the custodial symmetry coupling in the kinetic sector which generates the mass difference between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bosons . ] in the kinetic terms for the doublet fields . secondly , although the @xmath1 vertex is loop induced , its magnitude can be enhanced by non - decoupling effects of particles running in the loop , especially for the case where they come from the sector which breaks the custodial symmetry .",
    "for example , the top and bottom quark loop contributions to the @xmath1 vertex give the quadratic dependence upon the top quark mass  @xcite , which is responsible for the violation of the custodial symmetry in the yukawa sector .",
    "in refs .",
    "@xcite , the impact of extra higgs boson loop contributions on the @xmath1 vertex has been evaluated in the 2-higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a large mass splitting between the cp - odd higgs boson and the charged one gives a sizable correction to the @xmath1 vertex . from the above reasons ,",
    "it is clear that the strength of the @xmath1 vertex measures the effects of the violation of the custodial symmetry in the model embedding it .",
    "therefore , by measuring this vertex , we can indirectly observe such a new physics effect .",
    "feasibility studies to measure the @xmath1 vertex have been performed in ref .",

    "@xcite for future linear colliders .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the magnitude of the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) vertices at the one - loop level in the 3-higgs doublet model ( 3hdm ) , in which the higgs sector is composed of two @xmath19 ( with a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) ) and one @xmath20 ( without a non - zero vev ) doublet scalar fields . in this model",
    ", the scalar bosons from the inert doublet field give an additional contribution to the @xmath17 vertex with respect to the top / bottom quarks and scalar bosons from the active doublet loop contributions .",
    "as a phenomenological application , we also discuss how such new contributions change the decay branching fractions of the @xmath8 and @xmath11 modes and , consequently , the production cross sections involving these decay processes at the lhc .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .

    "[ br1 ] and  [ brx ] . as a result",
    ", @xmath60 attains a maximal value around @xmath61 150 gev , while @xmath62 is simply reduced as @xmath63 becomes larger since br(@xmath11 ) does not encounter any threshold ( as @xmath64 ) . for the ew processes ,",
    "the reduction of the production cross section ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) is milder than that of the top decay process ( @xmath65br(@xmath12 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the signal cross section of the ew processes become larger than the top decay process at @xmath66 gev .",
    "finally , we note that the signal cross sections in the type - x case is more than one order of magnitude smaller than those in the type - i case .",
    "we have computed the strength of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 vertices at the one - loop level in the 3hdm under a @xmath67 symmetry , which defines a higgs sector with two active doublets and one inert one .",
    "we have discussed all the four types of the yukawa interactions which are defined by the @xmath5 charge assignment to the sm fermions .",
    "we have taken into account vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity as theoretical constraints , and have considered the bounds from the ew @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 parameters , flavour experiments and direct searches for @xmath24 states at lep - ii and lhc run - i .",
    "we have seen that the mass of the @xmath0 can be smaller than the top quark mass in models with the type - i and type - x yukawa interactions , but not in type - ii and type - y .",
    "further , we have shown that , among all the form factors , only @xmath6 can be enhanced with respect to the 2hdm by taking large mass splittings between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , because of the non - decoupling effect of the inert scalar boson loop contributions .    in particular , we have found that in the 3hdm the squared form factor @xmath7 can be one order of magnitude larger than that predicted in the 2hdm under the aforementioned theoretical and experimental constraints .",
    "in addition , the branching fraction of the @xmath8 mode can be about 4  ( 0.2)% , 40  ( 2)% and 0.4  ( 0.3)% in the cases of @xmath70 , 170 and 200 gev , respectively with the type - i ( type - x ) yukawa interactions .",
    "in contrast , the branching fraction of the @xmath11 mode is at the few percent level as long as @xmath58 is smaller than the top quark mass in the type - i and type - x cases , thus benefiting from very little enhancement with respect to the 2hdm .",
    "such increased rates in the 3hdm stem from loop contributions due to inert higgs states that are absent in the 2hdm .    finally , we have discussed signal processes embedding @xmath71 and @xmath72 decays at the lhc . in the light @xmath0 scenario ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath73 , with the type - i and type - x yukawa interactions , the top quark decay process @xmath12 is the dominant production mode for @xmath0 except for the extreme case of @xmath74 . in the heavy @xmath0 scenario , i.e. , @xmath75 , this channel is no longer viable and we have resorted to the @xmath76 mode .",
    "( herein , we have emulated top production plus decay and @xmath0-strahlung via @xmath77 . ) in fact , there are also ew production modes , such as @xmath52 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . by combining the production and decay of @xmath0 s , we have considered the signal processes @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we have thus computed the ensuing cross sections in all cases and shown that the lhc run - ii has the potential to access @xmath71 and/or @xmath72 decays , certainly for light @xmath0 s ( at standard luminosity ) and possibly for heavy @xmath0 s ( at very high luminosity ) . to establish one or the other such signals at the cern machine may represent circumstantial evidence of a 3hdm sector , as opposed to a 2hdm .",

    "<S> we compute one - loop induced trilinear vertices with physical charged higgs bosons @xmath0 and ordinary gauge bosons , i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in the model with two active plus one inert scalar doublet fields under a @xmath3 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 and @xmath5 symmetries are introduced to guarantee the stability of a dark matter candidate and to forbid the flavour changing neutral current at the tree level , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant form factor @xmath6 of the @xmath1 vertex can be enhanced by non - decoupling effects of extra scalar boson loop contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in such a model , @xmath7 can be one order of magnitude larger than that predicted in two higgs doublet models under the constraints from vacuum stability , perturbative unitarity and the electroweak precision observables . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the branching fraction of the @xmath8 @xmath9 mode can be of order 10  ( 1)% level when the mass of @xmath0 is below the top quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> such a light @xmath0 is allowed by the so - called type - i and type - x yukawa interactions which appear under the classification of the @xmath10 charge assignment of the quarks and leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the cross sections for the processes @xmath8 and @xmath11 onset by the top quark decay @xmath12 and electroweak @xmath0 production at the lhc . </S>"
