    "the meson @xmath1 is the ground state of the heavy - flavored binding system @xmath2 , and it is the unique ` double heavy - flavored ' meson in standard model ( sm ) and is stable for strong and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the binding interaction for the system is similar to the case of heavy quarkonium @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "its mass and the spectrum of the binding system can be computed by potential model@xcite , pnrqcd@xcite and lattice qcd@xcite etc .",
    "the results are in the region , @xmath5gev .",
    "its lifetime was estimated in terms of the effective theory of weak interaction and by applying the effective lagrangian to the inclusive processes of @xmath1 decays@xcite . according to the estimates , the lifetime @xmath6ps , a typical one for weak interaction via virtual @xmath7 boson .",
    "hence with such a long lifetime , the vertex detection is very useful in its experimental observations .",
    "@xmath1 meson has been observed by cdf@xcite and d0@xcite already , and so far the observations are consistent with theoretical predictions within theoretical uncertainties and experimental errors .",
    "since the system @xmath2 carries two heavy flavors explicitly , its excited states decay to the ground state @xmath1 by electromagnetic and/or strong interaction directly or in a cascade way according to the available phase space with almost 100% possibility , while the ground state @xmath1 decays via weak interaction only . here",
    "i shall concentrate on the weak decay of the ground state meson @xmath1 .",
    "there are two ` spectator ways ' in the weak decay of @xmath1 meson : @xmath8-quark decays with @xmath9-quark as a ` spectator ' and @xmath9-quark decays with @xmath8-quark as a ` spectator ' .",
    "the interesting aspect of them is that the rates of these two ` ways ' are competitive in magnitude : the ckm matrix elements have @xmath10 , that is in favor of the @xmath8-quark decay greatly , whereas the phase space factor is proportional to the fifth power of the mass of the decay fermion for a weak decay via a virtual @xmath7-boson to a massless three - body final state , and @xmath11 for the two flavor , that compensates the ckm matrix element factor a lot .",
    "in fact , besides these two , there is one more important decay way only for the @xmath1 meson decay i.e. the annihilation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . here",
    ", when we talk about the three ` ways ' individually , it means that we have ignored the interferences among the amplitudes for the three ` ways ' in a moment .",
    "the interferences among them actually are not very great@xcite , therefore , the aspect obtained by the individual consideration is kept , so @xmath1 has very rich weak decay channels with comparable decay branching ratio@xcite .",
    "furthermore , by measuring the decay product , one may precisely know the specific decay is caused by @xmath8-quark decay or by @xmath9-quark decay .",
    "hence we may study the two heavy flavors @xmath8 and @xmath12 simultaneously just with one meson @xmath1 , and may gain some advantage in comparative studies of the two flavors e.g. in estimating and measuring the ratio of ckm matrix elements @xmath13 , because there is a cancellation for theoretical uncertainties and experimental systematic errors .    of the @xmath1 decay ,",
    "the rate of the decay caused by @xmath8-quark , in fact , is bigger than that caused by @xmath9-quark . as a consequence ,",
    "even though the available phase space for @xmath8-quark decay is comparatively small , the decay @xmath14 still has quite great branching ratio : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are taken into account too . ] . therefore , ` @xmath1 decay to @xmath17 ' can be used as a @xmath17 generator ( source ) potentially if the @xmath1 is produced numerously .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath17 meson generated from @xmath1 decay is ` tagged ' explicitly by @xmath1 charge , since @xmath1 carries positive charge .      to estimate the lifetime of @xmath1 , the most reliable way is to compute its inclusive decays with optics theorem and effective lagrangian for weak interaction .",
    "it is because that in this way the non - spectator effects can be taken into account and the non - perturbative effects are factorized out clearly .",
    "the two spectator components for @xmath1 decay , which are similar to that of @xmath18 and @xmath19 decay accordingly , contribute to the lifetime with the partial rates : @xmath20 i.e. @xmath9-quark decay with @xmath8-quark as spectator , and @xmath21 i.e. @xmath8-quark decay with @xmath9-quark as spectator .",
    "each of them includes both of the semileptonic and nonleptonic decays .    in @xmath1 decay ,",
    "the annihilation component is another important one and its contributions are different from those in @xmath18 and @xmath19 decays .",
    "the so - called weak annihilation ( via @xmath7 boson ) component contains @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 which correspond to the non - leptonic decay induced by the ` tree ' and ` penguin ' parts , and the pure leptonic ( pl ) decay are ignored .",
    "] respectively . the so - called pauli interference components ( interferences among the spectator components and annihilation component ) contain the ` tree ' part @xmath25 and the ` penguin ' part @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the total width of @xmath1 should be the sum of the partial widths @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    in table . 1",
    ", @xmath30 means the lifetime in unit @xmath31 ; @xmath32 is the decay constant in unit gev ; @xmath33 is the branching ratio of the @xmath9-quark inclusive decay to @xmath8-quark and the @xmath8 inside @xmath1 as the spectator ; @xmath34 is the branching ratio of the @xmath8-quark decay to @xmath35-quark and the @xmath9 inside @xmath1 as the spectator ; @xmath36 is that of the pure leptonic decay @xmath37 ( without pauli interference ) .",
    "owing to the interference , @xmath38 is negative , so the value of @xmath39 .",
    "all of the branching ratios in the table are in percentage .",
    "when determining the necessary input parameters , the authors of ref.@xcite further considered the measured lifetimes of @xmath18 mesons and @xmath19 mesons as well .",
    "as typical ones , here i quote the values of the theoretical estimate on the @xmath1 lifetime from ref.@xcite into table 1 should be @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 . ] . due to the uncertainties in treating the non - perturbative matrix elements in the estimates , there are some disagreements in the theoretical estimates on the lifetime which can be found in ref.@xcite , but at the present stage , all of them agree with the experimental measurements@xcite within the experimental errors",
    ".      the meson @xmath1 can decay by weak annihilation .",
    "of them , the pure leptonic decay is of specially interest due to the fact that it can be used to measure the decay constant @xmath32 and there is no strong interaction in final state of the decay and the induced ` penguin ' in the effective lagrangian plays no role to it .",
    "the vector left - hand nature of the weak interaction causes the so - called chiral suppression . indeed , due to the suppression ,",
    "the decays @xmath42 are negligible small because @xmath43 is negligible small .",
    "whereas , if there is additional particle such as one photon or one gluon in the final state , then the decay may escape from the chiral suppression .",
    "when there is an additional photon in final state , due to the ` escape ' , the branching ratio is enhanced by several magnitude order e.g. @xmath44 , and with a hard photon the absolute branching ratio still can be sizable as @xmath45 .",
    "detail analysis about the suppression and enhancement can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover if there is an additional gluon ( which fragments to light hadrons ) to the neutrino and charged lepton in the final state , the decay not only escapes from the chiral suppression but also can be used as a test of the color - octet components in the meson @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that such decay can be used to measure the color - octet components in the meson @xmath1 indeed , if the color - octet components in the meson are predicted as that by the ` scaling - rule ' of nrqcd .",
    "when the meson is produced numerously , as long as more attention is payed to the region of the decay phase - space that is close to the end point of the charged lepton ( the final state of the decay contains the charged lepton , light hadrons and missing neutrino only ) in the measurements , the color - octet components can be measured . in the ` end point ' region of the decay the contributions from the color - octet components become greater than those from the color - singlet components .",
    "the quantitative computations on the decays of @xmath1 to leptons with light hadrons ( which are fragmented from one or two gluons ) and the conclusion about the color - octet component measurements can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the essential factor which must be computed in nonleptonic decays with naive factorization and in semileptonic decays may be attributed to a matrix element of the relevant current as @xmath46 ( fig.1 ) , where the particle @xmath47 in initial state is @xmath1 , and the particle @xmath48 in final state is one of the particles @xmath49 .    , where the wave line represents a virtual ` particle ( @xmath7-boson ) ' which brings momentum and quantum number away ; the full dot represents the current which couples to the virtual @xmath7-boson ; the ladder - like spring - lines in right hand diagram mean the binding interactions multi - times between the two components .",
    "]    since the @xmath1 meson is much heavier than the bound state @xmath48 in the final state , so there may be a great momentum recoil , i.e. , the velocity @xmath50 of the produced bound state @xmath48 in c , m.s . of @xmath1 meson",
    "may be very great , e.g. , @xmath50 even may reach to @xmath51 ( in unit @xmath8 ) in the semileptonic decay @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the recoil effects should be treated carefully in estimation of the decays .    to deal with the recoil effects in the decays , there are several ways , but i think that all of them should ` contain ' multi - interactions between the components as indicated in fig.1 ( the right hand diagram ) . in refs.@xcite the authors consider the multi - interactions to dictate the recoil effects with bether - salpeter or dyson - schwinger equations , while in ref.@xcite the authors consider them with qcd sum rule with infinite ` coulomb gluon ' exchanges .",
    "the results obtained by the different ways are different due to the fact that each of them has taken certain approximations and has different input parameters , although all are similar in the inspirits .",
    "-wave state ( @xmath1 meson ) to a @xmath53-wave state ( e.g. @xmath54 ) . ]    in table.2 the value of the ckm matrix element is taken as @xmath55 and the coefficient in the effective lagrangian @xmath56 , the results in @xmath57 column is taken from ref.@xcite , those in column @xmath58 from ref.@xcite , those in column @xmath59 from ref.@xcite , those in column @xmath60 from ref.@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to point out here that due to the effects of the great momentum recoil , for the decays from @xmath61-wave ( @xmath1 meson ) to a @xmath53-wave state ( e.g. @xmath54 ) there are two ` isgur - wise'-like functions ( see fig.2 ) , while for the decays from @xmath61-wave ( @xmath1 meson ) to an @xmath61-wave state ( e.g. @xmath62 ) there is only one ` isgur - wise'-like function .",
    "the so - called ` isgur - wise'-like function(s ) means that all of the form factors for the decays may always be depicted by the function(s ) with proper kinematic factors as in the cases of hqet .",
    "the dotted curve in fig.2 represents the ` common ' one which is similar to that for the decays from @xmath61-wave to the @xmath61-wave state and decreases slowly with the momentum recoil @xmath63 .",
    "whereas the solid curve is a ` fresh ' ` isgur - wise'-like function , which is zero at @xmath64 ( null recoil ) and increases with the momentum recoil @xmath65 rapidly then goes down slowly .",
    "if the recoil effects had been ignored , then the fresh ` isgur - wise'-like function would always is zero .",
    "typical results of the semileptonic decays are put in table 2 and we can see that the decay rates of the channels with @xmath17 or @xmath66 in final state are great .",
    "the theoretical estimates on the nonleptonic decays of @xmath1 meson with naive factorization can be found in many references such as refs.@xcite etc .",
    "it is too long to present all of the results here , so alternatively , i only choose some of them to put in table 2 .",
    "one can see the general feature of the nonleptonic decays from table 2 that the decay rates of the channels with @xmath17 or @xmath66 in final state are also comparatively great .",
    "the reason why the first experimental observation of the ` usual ' meson @xmath1 happened so late in 1998 is because the difficulty of its production i.e. smallness of its production cross - section . only at high energy hadronic colliders",
    "can the cross - section be sizable enough for observation , so its first observation was successful at tevatron by cdf collaboration .",
    "according to theoretical estimates and the design luminosity of various kinds of colliders , accurately experimental studies of the meson under high statistics are accessible only at tevatron and lhc .",
    "since the meson @xmath1 carries two heavy flavors explicitly , so to produce it in the most favorable manner is to produce two pairs of heavy quarks : @xmath67 first , and then the two heavy quarks @xmath68 of them combine into the meson by certain possibility .",
    "two pairs of the quarks @xmath69 are so heavy that their production always in the perturbative region of qcd , while the ` possibility ' to combine the two heavy quarks @xmath68 into the meson , being nonperturbative nature , relates to a relevant matrix element in nrqcd framework ( for color - singlet production it can be related to the wave function of @xmath1 at origin in potential model framework ) directly@xcite . therefore the production of @xmath1 meson may be always estimated by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) with proper factorization formulation@xcite .    in table .",
    "3 , the characteristic energy scale @xmath70 is taken as @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the c.m .",
    "energy of the active subprocess or @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the transverse momentum of @xmath1 meson ; the values are taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "there are two theoretical approaches of pqcd to the estimate of its production : the so - called fragmentation approach@xcite and the so - called complete calculation approach of the lowest - order perturbative qcd@xcite .",
    "since the second one may keep more useful information of the production for experiments , it is highlighted in literature .",
    "there are several mechanisms for the hadronic production of @xmath1 meson , in most @xmath75 ( transverse momentum of the produced @xmath1 meson ) region , the so - called ` gluon - gluon fusion ' mechanism is domimant@xcite . since only lo estimates of @xmath1 production are available up - to now , so several important theoretical uncertainties for lo estimate are investigated in ref.@xcite",
    ". recently the @xmath53-wave excited @xmath1 production not only via its color - singlet component but also via its color - octet components is estimated , and it is pointed out that the @xmath53-wave production can be sizable@xcite . the general feature of the production is the cross sections increase slowly with the center mass energy of the collision @xmath76 .",
    "the total production cross - sections@xcite at tevatron and lhc are put in table .",
    "3 and the precise @xmath74 distributions for the production can be found in refs.@xcite . from table . 3",
    ", one still can see that the cross - sections at lhc are greater than those at tevatron by one order of magnitude , therefore , the studies at lhc can have much higher statistics than that at tevatron .",
    "it is remarkable that to meet various experimental needs of event simulation for feasibility studies of the meson @xmath1 at tevatron and lhc , a computer program ( the event generator for @xmath1 ) named bcvegpy that is in compliment to the pythia environment has been completed@xcite .",
    "it is powerful enough for most purposes , i.e. , with it one can enhance the event generating efficiency greatly in contrast to pythia itself . with the latest version bcvegpy2.0 , not only the ground state of @xmath1 meson",
    "can be generated , but can also its @xmath53-wave excited states .",
    "in prospects of the cross sections of @xmath1 production , available detectors , collision luminosity at tevatron ( run - ii ) and at lhc , accurately and thoroughly experimental studies of it is accessible very soon .",
    "@xmath1 physics is compelling . with very high statistics we will have various tests of the theoretical estimates ( predictions ) etc . and",
    "might have better measurements on ckm matrix elements .",
    "the self - tagged @xmath17 mesons via @xmath1 decays as a tagged @xmath17 source might be achieved .",
    "the future copious data require more accurate theoretical predictions in the environments at tevatron and at lhc respectively since now on etc .",
    "the studies of @xmath1 meson will jump to a new stage not only for itself but also to implement the studies of the heavy quarkonia etc .",
