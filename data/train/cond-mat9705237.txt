    "note that the density of states of the pairs is linearly temperature dependent .",
    "coherent coupling between pairs is destroyed if there is spontaneous decay during the up - down transition . for primary tls with @xmath73",
    "this occurs with a rate ( [ 4 ] ) , which guided burin and kagan to estimate the lower bound ( for secondary tls formed from symmetric primary tls ) @xmath74 comparing ( [ 23 ] ) with ( [ 6 ] ) yields @xmath75 this looks encouraging ; however , after a closer examination , there are several inconsistencies .",
    "first , maier et al .",
    "@xcite could fit their data with a _ temperature independent _",
    "parameter @xmath76 .",
    "burin and kagan s theory gives @xmath77 .",
    "the 10% variation , which maier et al.@xcite found between the 1 and 0.5  k data , is too weak to account for the linear temperature dependence of the theory .",
    "second , putting in numbers , we find for pmma at 1  k : @xmath78  k and @xmath79  mk , which is inconsistent with the experimental values ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 11 ] ) by several orders of magnitude . indeed , at 1  k , tls with @xmath80  k can never be responsible for spectral diffusion on the time scale between @xmath25 and @xmath81  s. however , it is possible that very asymmetric primary tls are responsible for long time spectral diffusion .",
    "for very asymmetric tls , the estimate of burin and kagan ( 28 ) would be significantly reduced . hence , though burin and kagan s theory predicts the measured time - dependence quite accurately , there arise severe inconsistencies in orders of magnitude and the temperature dependence upon applying their theory at 1  k. it should be mentioned that burin and kagan considered only the millikelvin regime , which avoids all these problems .",
    "though the picture developed by burin and kagan is very appealing , it explains only qualitatively the hole - burning data of maier et al . @xcite .",
    "the question arises whether a microscopic calculation can yield testable predictions based on the interacting tls scheme of burin and kagan .",
    "we carry out calculations based on strong coupling of tls to phonons with deformation potential @xmath82  ev .",
    "this allows for a shifting of the rate distribution towards longer times and indeed brings the  calculated \" value of @xmath76 ( see ( 29 ) ) into closer agreement with experiment .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of strong coupling effects alone gives a reasonable fit to the experiment of maier et al .",
    "for intermediate times ( cf .",
    "3(a ) ) .",
    "let us start with the usual spin - boson hamiltonian for an ensemble of tls interacting with phonons via a strain field . in the tls - eigenbasis",

    "the coupling between the tls will also be changed .",
    "the assumption traditionally made is that the dressed entities can be considered as weakly interacting .",
    "hence , first order perturbation theory in the dressed states might be sufficient at low temperatures .    based on this picture , kassner and silbey",

    "the flaws and merits of the kassner - silbey way of handling strong - tls - phonon - coupling effects have been discussed in ref . .",
    "an important point is that a @xmath101-interaction between tls , as used in burin and kagan s approach , can not be derived from this approach .    in appendix",
    "a we have generalized kassner and silbey s approach to include coherent coupling between pairs .",
    "our procedure has been as follows .",
    "first , we have eliminated the diagonal ( @xmath102 ) and off - diagonal ( @xmath103 ) coupling in the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) by two separate unitary transformations ( [ u1 ] ) and ( [ u2 ] ) .",
    "second , instead of continuing with the full transformed hamiltonian , we have projected out the _ one - phonon coupling part _ in the dressed state basis .",
    "this has been achieved by expanding the generated phonon shift operators around their mean value up to the first leading term in @xmath104 .",
    "this generates one - phonon transition matrix elements in the four - level system of the pair and , more importantly , debye - waller factors which renormalize burin and kagan s coherent coupling term ( [ 21 ] ) as @xmath105 here , @xmath106 which is equivalent to ( [ 14])-([17 ] ) .",
    "the pair asymmetry energy and tunneling amplitude read @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "one should note that for @xmath109 the debye - waller factor @xmath110 is practically unity except for nearly symmetric tls .",
    "since we will be mainly interested in strongly asymmetric tls , we will always use this simplification hereafter . in appendix",
    "b we calculate the pair parameter distribution function .",
    "the result is : @xmath111 with @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a modified bessel function , and @xmath114 with @xmath115 the parameters @xmath116 are cutoffs which are set by the requirement of stability for the coupled pairs .",
    "@xmath117 is a cutoff in the energy of the _ primary _ tls , which , as we will see below , is generally a function of the temperature . if @xmath118 , @xmath119 is the sum of a constant and a bell shaped curve centered around @xmath120 with a width of @xmath121 .",

    "this confirms that their model is valid at ultralow temperatures for nearly symmetric tls with weak coupling to phonons . in the limit @xmath127 ,",
    "the asymptotic expansion of the modified bessel function , @xmath128 , ( @xmath129 ) , provides a renormalization of @xmath130 by a factor @xmath131 .",
    "to determine @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we first neglect the level broadening effect of the phonons .",
    "then , @xmath132 scales with the glass transition temperature , and @xmath133 is set by the concentration @xmath134 of pairs in the glass . to determine @xmath134 , we start with estimating the probability for 2 tls separated by a distance @xmath135 to form a pair to @xmath136",

    "the maximum volume @xmath143 each of these pairs can occupy is given by @xmath144 which determines the minimum interaction energy @xmath145 .",

    "we will not provide a full discussion of the relaxation dynamics in the four - level system of the pair , but instead try to argue more physically .",
    "after two unitary transformations ( [ u1 ] ) and ( [ u2 ] ) , one finds the hamiltonian ( [ a1 ] ) as is pointed out in appendix a. here , only the term @xmath150 allows relaxation within the up - down subspace @xmath151 .",
    "the relaxation mechanism is a flip - flop process linked with the emission or absorption of a phonon . the relaxation rate scales with @xmath152 : @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "we used that @xmath156 , as discussed in appendix a. note that there is no debye - waller factor of the kassner - silbey type because of the coupling of the phonons to @xmath157 instead of to @xmath158 .",
    "the coherent coupling is destroyed by spontaneous decay during the up - down transition of primary tls constituting a pair : for instance @xmath159 . based on this argument , burin and kagan estimated @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the decay rate of _ symmetric _ , primary tls with @xmath162 . clearly , on a the time scale explored in the experiment of maier et al .",
    ", strongly asymmetric tls dominate the hole width instead of symmetric ones .",
    "note that in constructing @xmath163 ( eq .",
    "( 42 ) ) , we integrated over values of the energy splittings of the primary tls less than @xmath164 , which have the correct initial population factors to insure the creation of stable pair excitations .",
    "we now investigate which primary tls are able to guarantee stability of secondary tls at 1  k , i.e. , we ask whether the limit @xmath165 or @xmath166 applies .",
    "we first study if secondary tls may be formed from primary tls with thermal splitting , @xmath167 , at 1  k. we need to satisfy three conditions .",
    "first , we require @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the relaxation rate of a primary thermal tls which has not yet decayed at @xmath27 , i.e. , for which ( cf . eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) ) @xmath170 with @xmath171  s. these two requirements guarantee that the secondary tls is coherent on the time scale where deviations from logarithmic spectral diffusion is seen .",
    "furthermore , if secondary tls are responsible for the spectral line broadening after @xmath25  s , the pair rate must satisfy @xmath172 .",
    "this provides the relation @xmath173 . using this relation , multiplying eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) by @xmath174 and squaring it , one can now easily check that eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) always implies eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) .    with respect to the stability of secondary tls at 1  k ,",
    "we conclude : first , from the condition ( [ b2 ] ) we deduce the criterion @xmath175 , i.e , the primary tls must be very asymmetric .",
    "second , upon replacing @xmath176 [ cf .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) ] and noting that @xmath177 for @xmath178 , we find the criterion @xmath179 hence , according to @xmath180 and @xmath181  k  @xmath51 , the relevant tls are separated by a distance @xmath182   .",
    "note that these estimates are highly approximate .",
    "in particular , we have approximated the rate at which coherence in a secondary tls is destroyed by the relaxation rate of a primary tls , without consideration of the true rates that govern the coupled four level system .",
    "however , we may still conclude that at 1  k , it is unlikely that primary tls with thermal splitting , @xmath183 , can form pairs , unless they sit extremely close to each other .",
    "this fact suggests a natural cutoff , @xmath184 , in the energy splittings of the primary tls that comprise the secondary tls existing at 1  k. this cutoff is motivated by the above stability criteria , and can change the temperature dependence of @xmath185 in eq .",

    ".      we have noted in the previous section that it is very unlikely that thermal primary tls can form stable pairs at 1  k. if we impose a minimum separation distance between primary tls ( say 5  ) , then a natural energy cutoff enters due to the stability requirements outlined in the previous section .",
    "if we assume that this cutoff @xmath117 satisfies the condition @xmath221 then we can estimate @xmath164 from the conditions considered in sec .",

    "this shows that @xmath228 , which significantly alters the temperature dependence of the hole width . if the above condition is met , then @xmath229 and @xmath230 in the regime where @xmath220 , this expression is essentially temperature independent .",
    "thus , the stability requirements imply an interesting thermal breakup of the secondary tls .",
    "for very low temperatures ( @xmath231 ) , the majority of asymmetric tls are stable even if constructed from asymmetric primary tls that have energy splittings on the order of @xmath232 , leading to the strong temperature dependence depicted in fig .",
    "we have argued that at higher temperatures , a crossover should occur where the temperature dependence should become weaker , as secondary tls become less stable .",
    "therefore , it is qualitatively consistent with this picture that the observed temperature dependence at @xmath233  k is weaker than that shown in fig .",
    "such arguments require further  slowing down \" of the temperature dependence .",
    "this is indeed seen experimentally at 2  k. @xcite hannig et al .",
    "are able to fit their data with essentially the same value of @xmath76 at 0.5  k and 1  k , and a value of @xmath234  k ) at 2  k. eventually , the entire tls picture should break down at some temperature in the range 1 - 10  k. a clear test of the validity of this picture would be to see if the stronger temperature dependence emerges at lower temperatures .",
    "such experiments are difficult to conduct at ultralow temperatures , due to slow equilibration effects .",
    "we may also note that the discrepancy between the  derived \" and literature values of @xmath235 can be explained by the thermal breakup of secondary tls demanded by stability criteria .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the primary tls must lie closer together to form a stable secondary tls at long times .",
    "the probability of finding two neighboring primary tls a very close distance apart is small , which effectively decreases the  derived \" value of @xmath235 .",
    "note that there is also a reduction in @xmath199 due to the factor @xmath236 ( see eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , at least qualitatively , it is indeed possible that a picture based on coupled tls can account for all the properties currently observed in longtime spectral diffusion experiments .",
    "so far we have shown the pros and cons of applying the idea of coupled pairs to hole - burning experiments on ultralong time scales at 1  k. here we propose an interesting experiment which , although difficult to perform , would provide a conclusive test of the coupled tls hypothesis .",
    "a crucial observation is that the exponent of the power law depends on the _ dimensionality _ of the glassy probe .",
    "for example , the exponent would be systematically smaller if the primary tls were confined to ( quasi)-two dimensions , while the interaction between them still varies as @xmath237 .",
    "this would result in a distribution function @xmath238 ( from @xmath239 and @xmath240 , @xmath241   constant ) and therefore in a @xmath242-power law .",
    "the experiment we suggest has already been performed , albeit not not for the purpose that we discuss here and not on a time scale up to @xmath81  s. the hole - burning experiment by orrit et al.@xcite on an ionic dye in a langmuir - blodgett monolayer lying on a three - dimensional substrate is an experiment of the type we proposed above  the tls dynamics is restricted to two dimensions whereas sound waves and strain are not affected by the interface between the amorphous layer and the bulk . indeed , orrit et al.@xcite have observed spectral diffusion which could be explained by pack and fayer@xcite using the standard tunneling model . from this perspective",
    "it seems promising to extend orrit s experiment to longer times and look whether a power law weaker than the three - dimensional result @xmath216 could be observed .",
    "there are , however , reasons to be skeptical of the picture we have outlined .",
    "a number of approximations have been invoked that render only a semiquantitative description of the experimental results .",
    "these approximations include the reduction of the primary tls to an effective secondary tls , and the use of relaxation rates for uncoupled tls to discuss decoherence effects for coupled secondary tls .",
    "these approximations , especially the first one , may not be valid at temperatures near 1  k. clearly , one has to think about alternative explanations .",
    "a simple idea would be to attribute the deviation from the standard @xmath21-behavior to a _",
    "nonequilibrium _ state of those tls which relaxes on these long time scales .",
    "indeed , recent experiments by friedrich et al .",
    "@xcite have proven that spectral diffusion in glasses under nonequilibrium conditions results in a nonlogarithmic time evolution of the hole width .",
    "however , the data in maier s experiment were obtained after letting the sample relax at the measurement temperature for a longer period than the later data recording period .",
    "hence , one expects that all relaxation processes shorter than this waiting time occur under equilibrium conditions .",
    "it is interesting to compare the glass results with equivalent experiments on proteins .",
    "hole - burning experiments on proteins show almost no hole broadening up to three hours , followed by a nonlogarithmic hole broadening regime .",
    "@xcite a new type of temperature - cycle hole - burning experiments@xcite leads to the conclusion that the excess broadening of the hole in the protein can not be interpreted in the framework of the stm .",
    "hence , one might speculate that in both glasses and proteins , the interaction of tls becomes important at long time scales .",
    "an alternative conclusion avoids the notion of interacting tls altogether .",
    "perhaps the energy landscape of glasses is not too different from that of proteins , and also shows features of organization at high barriers .",
    "recall that the experiments of maier et al .",
    "were carried out in pmma , which is a polymer glass .",
    "polymer glasses may be expected to have conformations similar to proteins .",
    "for example , such  conformational \" dynamics may involve side chain motions .",
    "the physical picture is that the energy landscape comprises high barriers in addition to constantly distributed lower barriers within each of its basins .",
    "the algebraic behavior then results from tunneling through those high barriers , which have to be distributed around a `` typical '' value @xmath243 .",
    "this value has to be sufficiently high in order that the onset of the algebraic behavior occurs only after 3  h. we give some details on these ideas in appendix c ; more can be found in ref . .",
    "the model predicts a temperature and time - dependence of the hole width with an exponent which is slightly weaker than @xmath244 and @xmath245 , respectively , and a slowly decreasing function of @xmath246 and @xmath27 .",
    "we note that if indeed specific polymer dynamics ( like side chain motion ) are responsible for deviations from logarithmic spectral diffusion , perhaps a deuterated sample may show different hole broadening behavior .",
    "one is tempted to speculate that these `` non - stm like '' high barriers arise from the presence of the chromophore in the glassy host@xcite , because they have not been observed in sound attenuation experiments up to 100  k.@xcite note however , that these experiments were not performed on polymer glasses , and that sound attenuation experiments on pmma and ps indeed show an additional peak above ca .",
    "50  k.@xcite interestingly , doping a network glass with oh - impurities leads to the same observation @xcite , which conceivably supports the importants of side chain motion in polymer glasses .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the glass , the protein probe is not doped by a dye .",
    "instead part of the protein is chemically changed in order to serve as a chromophore .",
    "thus , it seems that such deviations from standard spectral diffusion behavior are not due to the inclusion of the chromophore into the sample .",
    "one should also note nonlogarithmic line broadening is the _ typical _ case because a logarithmic time dependence occurs only in case of a @xmath247-distribution for the singular case @xmath248 . without invoking the physical reasons for deviations from the standard @xmath249 distribution function introduced by anderson , halperin and varma , and of phillips",
    ", we may say that for small values of @xmath6 ( corresponding to long times ) , the distribution of barriers is not really flat , but instead a smoothly varying function of the parameter @xmath250 ( see appendix c ) .",
    "that the distribution of barriers in such a model turns out to be a log - normal distribution shows a striking similarity to general systems exhibiting @xmath251 noise . @xcite",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the consistency of the conjecture that _ coupled pairs of tls dominate spectral diffusion on ultralong time scales_. because the pairs distribution @xmath252 is correlated with the distribution of the primary `` stm - like '' tls , we have in a sense pushed the stm as far as possible by looking at these new low energy excitations .",
    "we believe that this is an important step , which has to be done _ before _ trying to find another extension of the stm for every new experiment .",
    "the questions was whether they also apply to the 1  k regime , and , in particular , whether they can provide an explanation of the longtime hole - burning experiment of maier et al .",
    "we find that a picture based on the idea of interacting tunneling systems seems consistent with the experimental data , although we are unable to fit certain aspects of the experiment , such as the temperature dependence , quantitatively .",
    "also , alternative explanations have been presented .",
    "these models are , at the moment , at least as speculative as the scenario of coherently coupled pairs .",
    "for this reason , we have discussed some possible experimental tests of the theoretical models we have presented . more theory and experiments",
    "have to be done to finally evaluate the role of coupled tls in glasses , and to understand the origin of nonlogarithmic hole broadening in glasses .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the nsf and the alexander von humboldt foundation .",
