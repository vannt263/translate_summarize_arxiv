    "late time acceleration is one of the most profound observations made for the evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "current experimental research @xcite aims to further enlighten both the late time era and also evolution stages that belong to higher redshift .",
    "one of the latest observational successes was the verification of the b - mode power spectrum @xcite , which verifies the existence of the inflationary era @xcite of the universe .",
    "in addition to observational methods that use standard candles , such us supernovas and gamma ray bursts , there exist other methods proposed in the literature that may reveal the way that our universe evolves in cosmic time , using indirect methods , such us by observing the spectrum of direct dark matter scattering @xcite . for methods of observing dark matter directly in the laboratory , see @xcite .    in reference to late time acceleration",
    ", the cosmological models accounting for dark energy or late time acceleration largely take the two distinct ways .",
    "one is to add directly in the einstein equations some non - standard matter component , with the most well known candidate being the cosmological constant @xmath1 , and the corresponding model of cosmological evolution is known as the @xmath1-cold - dark - matter(@xmath1cdm ) . according to this model ,",
    "the universe consists of ordinary matter ( @xmath2 ) , cold dark matter ( @xmath3 ) , and dark energy ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "dark energy is the component of the matter energy tensor that generates the late time acceleration and one way to model this is provided by the @xmath0 theories of gravity @xcite , in which the right hand of the einstein equations is directly modified due to the existence of terms coming from the geometry of the theory itself . for a list of reviews and important papers on this vast topic , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the challenge in modern cosmology is to find a unique theoretical framework to explain both late time and inflation at once .",
    "one such description was provided at first time by the nojiri - odintsov model in @xcite , in which dark energy and also inflation was generated from a single model . for theories that can also consistently address the dark energy problem , see @xcite and relevant references therein and for a recent study on unified dark energy with quintessential inflation @xcite , see @xcite .    in a recent study @xcite",
    ", we investigated the effect of collisional matter @xcite on the late time evolution of the universe , in the context of @xmath0 modified theories of gravities .",
    "the resulting picture of our investigation was that the behavior of the collisional matter filled universe , varied in a model dependent way , giving in some cases better fit to the @xmath1cdm model with respect to the non - collisional matter filled universe , always in the context of @xmath0 gravities .",
    "motivated by this rather vague result , in this paper we further scrutinize the effect of collisional matter in the cosmological evolution of @xmath0 theories .",
    "our approach is different with regards to our previous work , in which we were interested in the late time epoch . in the present work we shall consider the matter domination eras and also study the oscillatory behavior of dark energy . with regards to the matter domination era , we shall also examine the matter perturbations of the collisional universe and compare it to the non - collisional matter filled universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 1 we briefly review the fundamental features of @xmath0 gravity , in section 2 we present necessary information for the exponential @xmath0 gravity model which we shall use and also for the we give a brief account on the collisional matter essentials .",
    "then , by introducing the necessary for our study variables , we explicitly re - calculate the corresponding equations of motion and we solve these numerically .",
    "we investigate the behavior of the dark energy density , the dark energy equation of state parameter , the effective equation of state parameter and also the hubble parameter .",
    "we compare the results coming from a collisional matter filled plus radiation universe with those coming from a universe filled with ordinary matter plus radiation .",
    "we give special attention to dark energy oscillations in the process and investigate how the oscillations behave under the change of the parameters that characterize the collisional matter . in the end of section 2 , we study in detail the behavior of matter perturbations and focus our investigation on the study of the growth factor as a function of the redshift @xmath5 . in section 3 , we discuss in detail the results of this article and combine these to our previous work results @xcite .",
    "the conclusions follow in the end of the paper .",
    "in order to maintain the article self contained , it worths recalling the essential features of the jordan frame formulated @xmath0 modified theories of gravity , considered in the metric formalism",
    ". for detailed work on these issues , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is assumed that the geometric background is that of a pseudo - riemannian manifold , which locally is a lorentz metric , which in our case is a flat friedmann - robertson - walker",
    "metric ( frw hereafter ) , of the following form , @xmath6 the corresponding to this metric ricci scalar is , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the hubble parameter and the `` dot '' denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmological time @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that the connection on this manifold is a torsion - less , symmetric , and metric compatible affine connection , the levi - civita connection .",
    "the general action that describes @xmath0 modified theories of gravity in the four dimensional jordan frame is , @xmath10 with @xmath11 and in addition @xmath12 contains all the matter content of the theory .",
    "variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath13 results in the following equations of motion , @xmath14 where as usual , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the energy momentum tensor corresponding to ordinary matter fields . as we already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "in the context of @xmath0 theories , dark energy finds an elegant and self consistent description and it is named geometric dark energy .",
    "the reason for this can directly be extracted from the equations of motion above ( [ modifiedeinsteineqns ] ) .",
    "as it can be seen , the left hand side of these equations is identical to the einstein equations of general relativity , while the right hand side is modified in a way that describes ordinary matter plus a contribution coming from a perfect fluid contribution , with purely geometric origin .",
    "indeed we can write the equations of motion in the following form ( for a very informative work on this see @xcite ) , @xmath17 with @xmath18 being equal to , @xmath19 and originating from ordinary matter perfect fluids , while @xmath20 is equal to , @xmath21 the energy momentum tensor ( [ tmnmatcurv ] ) is attributed to a perfect fluid of geometric origin , which describes the dark energy and is also called curvature fluid .",
    "in principle an @xmath0 gravity model has to pass a series of serious tests in order it can be considered a viable model .",
    "the constraints put by these tests are coming both from local astrophysical data and also from global , at a cosmological level , considerations , see for example @xcite and related references therein . in this paper",
    "we shall consider a viable exponential model , firstly studied in @xcite by cognola , elizalde et al .",
    ", which passes all the viability tests and also provides a very elegant theoretical framework for explaining late time acceleration and also inflation , at the early stages of the universe s evolution , mimicking the @xmath1cdm model at large curvature values . for studies on exponential models ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the model is described by the following @xmath0 function , @xmath22 with @xmath1 being the cosmological constant corresponding to present time , which is equal to @xmath23ev@xmath24 and @xmath25 is a free positive parameter which is assumed to be @xmath26 ( we adopt the numerical values of reference @xcite ) .",
    "regardless the good viability properties of the model ( [ expmodnocurv ] ) , there are some complications that arise in the process of the cosmological evolution and particularly during the matter domination era .",
    "particularly , the higher derivatives of the hubble parameter diverge , an issue that originates from the dark energy oscillations during the matter phase @xcite .",
    "in fact for large values of the redshift , there occur high frequency dark energy oscillations , and also the derivatives of the dark energy density , denoted as @xmath27 , take large values , which leave this imprint in the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath28 .",
    "actually , the dark energy oscillations become more pronounced ( higher frequency ) in @xmath0 modified gravity models that mimic more the @xmath1cdm model , which practically speaking occurs when @xmath29 is close to zero .",
    "thus our fundamental function of the exponential model ( [ expmodnocurv ] ) to correct einstein s gravity in the small curvature regime , causes undesirable features in the high curvature regime .",
    "a way out of this is offered by directly modifying the @xmath0 gravity lagrangian , in order to stabilize dark energy oscillations , in such a way so that the frequency of the oscillations becomes constant @xcite .",
    "a consistent modification was proposed in @xcite , so that the curvature corrected @xmath0 lagrangian reads , @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the addition of the curvature correction stabilizes the dark energy oscillations while keeping all the viability features of the model intact .",
    "for example the minkowski spacetime still is the flat space solution and the effects of the curvature correction vanish in the de - sitter epoch , provided @xmath33 , which obviously is satisfied for the adopted value of @xmath34 .",
    "the detailed description of a perfect matter fluid with interactions was given in @xcite and reference therein ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it worths recalling in brief , the basic features which we shall use in this article .",
    "the basic assumption to be made is that the collisional matter has a total mass - energy density , denoted as @xmath35 , which receives two contributions in it s functional form and reads , @xmath36 in the expression above , @xmath37 stands for the rest mass density which remains unaffected by the internal motions of the gravitational cosmic fluid and the part containing the potential energy @xmath38 , is what renders the matter fluid collisional @xcite .",
    "the collisional matter is considered to be a prefect fluid with equation of state , @xmath39 with the equation of state parameter taking values @xmath40 .",
    "the potential energy density is assumed to be of the form @xcite , @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 denoting the present values of the motion invariant mass energy density and of the potential energy , respectively .",
    "hence , the total energy density of the gravitational fluid is equal to , @xmath44}\\ ] ] in addition and due to the continuity equation for the collisional matter fluid ( see the book of fock @xcite , pages 90 - 93 ) , the continuity equation of the gravitational fluid in a spatially flat frw metric takes the following form , @xmath45 which leads to @xcite , @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 denoting the scale factor and it s present value respectively . finally the value of @xmath43 is equal to @xcite , @xmath49 which we shall use in our numerical calculations . in the next section",
    "we shall go through the equations of cosmological evolution and see in detail how these are modified in the presence of a collisional matter fluid with total mass - energy density given by relation ( [ totenergydens ] ) .",
    "our basic intention and core subject of this section , is to study the cosmological evolution of a universe filled with collisional matter and radiation , with special emphasis in the redshift region which corresponds to matter domination and later .",
    "this is in order to study the dark energy oscillations during this era , which as we already mentioned in the previous sections , can have a significant value during this era and at low redshifts in general .",
    "we shall express the quantities entering the frw equations in terms of the redshift parameter @xmath50 and also use new variables , appropriate for the study of dark energy oscillations .",
    "we shall perform a numerical analysis of the modified frw equations for the type of collisional matter described in the previous section , and thoroughly study the behavior of the dark energy density @xmath51 , the modified hubble parameter , @xmath52 and of the effective equation of state parameter @xmath53 , which we re - express later in terms of the new variables we shall introduce . for the numerical analysis",
    ", we shall take into account values of the redshift @xmath54 , which covers the last stages of the matter domination era , which started at approximately @xmath55 and is considered to end at @xmath56 ( this can vary from model to model ) .",
    "after that the late time acceleration era starts .",
    "the motivation for us to use the redshift as our central parameter of our analysis comes from the fact that , the cosmological distances in standard cosmology are determined by using standard candles as references , such as typeia supernovae or gamma ray bursts ( grb hereafter wherever used ) .",
    "the typeia supernovae correspond to a redshift with values between @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , grbs are visible in much more higher redshifts , up to @xmath58 , which corresponds to the late stages of the matter domination era .",
    "this is why we shall use values of the redshift with @xmath59 , in order to take into account future observational data coming from grbs corresponding to high redshifts with @xmath60 .    in order to proceed in the description of the cosmological evolution , we rewrite the cosmological equations in a specific form .",
    "particularly , the frw equations of motion ( [ modifiedeinsteineqns ] ) can be written in the following form , @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the total mass - energy density containing all the matter fluids . in the present case the matter fluids we shall take into account consist of collisional matter and relativistic matter ( radiation ) ,",
    "so @xmath62 is in our case , @xmath63 and by taking into account relations ( [ totenergydens ] ) and ( [ evlotuniomatt ] ) , equation ( [ totalmattenergdensmf ] ) becomes , @xmath64}+\\rho_{r}^{(0)}a^{-4}\\ ] ] in addition , @xmath65 is the corresponding total pressure corresponding to all the matter fluids .",
    "the first equation of the frw equations in relation ( [ eq : flrw ] ) can be written as , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ricci scalar which for the purposes of this paper , can be written as , @xmath68 in order to provide general formulas that hold true for any type of collisional matter , we shall assume that the total matter - energy density takes the following general form , @xmath69 with @xmath42 and @xmath70 being the present values of the mass - energy densities of matter and radiation respectively , and @xmath71 being defined as the ratio @xmath72 .",
    "so practically , the collisional nature of the non - relativistic matter is described by the function @xmath73 , which in the case of collisional matter described in the previous section , this is equal to , @xmath74}\\ ] ] in order to consistently describe the dark energy oscillations , we re - express the cosmological equations ( [ eq : modifiedeinsteineqns2 ] ) in terms of new parameters which have vanishing values at the high redshift limits , where the @xmath0 modifications are negligible @xcite ,    @xmath75    with @xmath27 the energy density of dark energy .",
    "so the new quantity which quantifies the cosmological evolution is , @xmath76 , which is the scaled dark energy density , and scaled by the factor @xmath42 . dividing the equations ( [ eq : modifiedeinsteineqns2 ] ) by @xmath77 , and upon using , @xmath78 from ( [ eq : yh ] ) , we solve the resulting expression with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "the final result is , @xmath80\\frac{1}{h^2f''}\\ ] ] upon differentiation of relation ( [ eq : yr ] ) , with respect to @xmath81 we get , @xmath82 in which we substitute ( [ eq : drdlna ] ) , @xmath83\\frac{1}{h^2f''}\\ ] ] upon differentiation of ( [ eq : yh ] ) with respect to @xmath81 , we get , @xmath84 where we made use of relation ( [ eq : yh ] ) . combining equations ( [ eq : dhlna ] ) and ( [ eq : dyr ] ) , we get the following expression , @xmath85\\frac{1}{\\tilde{m}^2f''(y_h+g(a)+\\chi a^{-4})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] differentiating relation ( [ eq : drdlna ] ) with respect to @xmath81 , results to , @xmath86 from ( [ eq : ricciscal2 ] ) and ( [ eq : yh ] ) we get , @xmath87 so relation ( [ eq : dyh ] ) becomes , @xmath88 and in addition the ricci scalar can be written as , @xmath89 upon differentiation of relation ( [ eq : dyh2 ] ) with respect to @xmath81 , @xmath90 and by making use of relation ( [ eq : dyr2 ] ) , we obtain , @xmath91 finally we express all quantities as functions of the redshift @xmath5 , and order to do that , we shall make use of the following expressions ,    @xmath92    then , by applying the above formulas in relation ( [ eq : frform ] ) , we obtain the following final form of the differential equation that describes the cosmological evolution of the universe filled with radiation and collisional matter , @xmath93 which is a second order differential equation in terms of the scaled dark energy @xmath94 . in the rest of this section",
    "we solve numerically this equation for the matter profile @xmath73 given in relation ( [ fgd ] ) and compare the dark energy oscillations and the cosmological evolutions of collisional matter in comparison to the non - collisional one .",
    "it worths to present briefly the set of initial conditions and also the values of the various parameters we shall use . specifically , the present value of the matter density is @xmath95 , the equation of state parameter of collisional matter shall be assumed to have two different values , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and the initial conditions are taken to be identical to those used in reference @xcite , @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 , @xmath77 being defined in the previous sections .",

    "before we close this section let us note that apart from the scaled dark energy density and the dark energy equation of state parameters , all the other parameters we examined generated almost indistinguishable cosmological evolution for a universe filled with collisional or non - collisional matter .",

    "we used a popular exponential @xmath0 model , with curvature corrections , which is given in relation ( [ expmodnocurvcorr ] ) .",
    "the resulting picture is that , in general , collisional matter generates a pronounced oscillatory behavior for dark energy , in reference to non - collisional matter ( see figures [ ycomp ] and [ omegadecomp ] ) .",
    "however , the cosmological evolution of the universe quantified in terms of the hubble parameter , the effective equation of state parameter and the scalar curvature , looks quite similar in both collisional and non - collisional matter filled universes ( see figures [ hubcurv ] and [ weffcomp ] ) . in addition to this , by looking table 1 , we can see that some observational data coming from collisional matter filled universe , always for the @xmath0 model under study , are quite closer to the observational data , in comparison to the non - collisional matter case . for example",
    "the value of the dark energy equation of state for @xmath97 in the collisional matter case , is much closer to the observed value .",
    "however , in the same case , the dark energy density for the non - collisional matter is closer to the observed value , than the corresponding value of the collisional matter case .",
    "in addition , collisional matter generates different matter perturbations , in comparison to the ones generated from non - collisional matter .",
    "we have to note that the same conclusions hold true for other @xmath0 models we tried , for example the curvature corrected @xmath143-model , but we omit the details for brevity .",
    "notice however that the present exponential model combines many elegant characteristics which render it as an ideal viable reference model for these studies .    in conclusion",
    ", it is rather difficult to decide whether the effect of collisional matter makes the resulting picture better or worse .",
    "it is necessary to further scrutinize the effects of collisional matter so we can have more arguments in favor or against collisional matter .",
    "some aspects of the cosmological evolution we did not address in this article , but should be thoroughly studied are the following : firstly , one should perform a detailed analysis of the density perturbations in the framework of @xmath0 theories . note that density perturbations may be extracted from any first order tensor orthogonal to the four velocity , and describes the scalar part of any perturbation variables .",
    "there exist very stringent constraints coming from baryon acoustic oscillations and these could shed some light on whether we should consider the collisional matter a necessary ingredient of the matter content of our universe .",
    "secondly , since we only restricted our study to @xmath0 theories in the jordan frame , one should try to study the evolution of a universe filled with collisional matter in the einstein frame , by making a conformal transformation of the original @xmath0 theory .",
    "moreover , in order to be detached from the @xmath0 framework , the same study we performed here should be done for scalar tensor theories , thus for gravitational theories that contain scalar fields . in the same study , it is possible to examine how the parametrization of the dark energy transition to the phantom epoch is affected by the presence of collisional matter .",
    "it worths to briefly present the late time cosmological evolution of the exponential model ( [ expmodnocurv ] ) in terms of the deceleration parameter @xmath144 , as a function of the redshift @xmath5 , a study which was absent in our previous work @xcite . following the approach we adopted in @xcite , and omitting the details for brevity , in fig .",
    "[ myti ] we plot the deceleration parameter @xmath144 for collisional matter ( blue ) , non collisional matter ( red ) and for the @xmath1cdm model ( black ) .",
    "as it is obvious , in this case too , the collisional matter filled universe gives better fit to the @xmath1cdm curve .     over z , for the model @xmath145 .",
    "the blue , red , and black lines refer to collisional , non - collisional , and @xmath146 models , respectively . ]",
    "before we close this section we comment on another rather interesting feature of the collisional matter filled universe .",
    "it is known that the cosmographic indication suggest that the cosmological standard model expressed in terms of the hubble parameter , is extended in the following way @xcite , @xmath147 notice relation ( [ fgd ] ) , which when expressed in terms of the redshift @xmath5 , takes the following form , @xmath148}+\\chi ( z+1)^{4}}\\ ] ] we have to notice the resemblance between the two hubble parameters . in a future work , it worths trying to fit the collisional matter hubble parameter ( [ hubbleparcaponew ] ) with the cosmographically indicated one ( [ capowner ] ) .",
    "we have studied the effect of collisional matter on the cosmological evolution of an viable curvature corrected exponential @xmath0 model and compared the results to those coming from the same theoretical framework but with non - collisional matter .",
    "particularly , we focused our study on the oscillatory behavior of dark energy during the matter domination era and at later epochs , an effect that is owing to the existence of diverging higher derivatives of the hubble parameter .",
    "this phenomenon is present in the exponential @xmath0 model , even in the presence of ordinary , that is , non - collisional matter , and as we explicitly demonstrated , this also occurs in the collisional matter case .",
    "moreover , this oscillatory behavior is even more pronounced in the collisional matter case , and as the collisional matter equation of state parameter @xmath103 takes lower values , this phenomenon is not so intense .",
    "specifically , this oscillatory behavior can be seen in the study of the dark energy equation of state parameter and for @xmath5 taking values in the matter domination era . however , one important result of our analysis is that the effective equation of state parameter oscillates but never crosses the phantom divide and in addition the oscillations are not so severe .",
    "the cosmological evolution of collisional and non - collisional matter filled universes are almost indistinguishable , a fact that motivated us to study matter perturbations in order to reveal differences in the process of cosmic expansion .",
    "as we explicitly showed by studying the growth factor , the evolution of matter perturbations is different in the two forms of matter , so this can distinguish the cosmic evolution of collisional and non - collisional matter .",
    "the final picture is rather vague , since in some cases collisional matter produces a cosmology that fits better the observational data in comparison to non - collisional matter , always in the context of viable @xmath0 theories . on the other hand ,",
    "the oscillatory behavior of dark energy is pronounced in the collisional matter case , and as a result the final picture is not clear if the existence of some sort of interaction between ordinary non - relativistic matter can be considered as a true fact .",
    "therefore , one should further scrutinize the effects of collisional matter , until a conclusion is reached .",
    "in addition , one should try to embed the collisional matter effects into other cosmological theoretical frameworks , such as scalar - tensor theories and also further study the evolution of matter perturbations more concretely . for an interesting work with respect to the latter see @xcite .",
    "we hope to address these issues in a future work .",
