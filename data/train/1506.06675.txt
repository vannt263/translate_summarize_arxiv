    "the lhc run - i has led the standard model ( sm ) particle content to be completed by discovering the higgs boson ( @xmath1 ) with the 125 gev mass  @xcite .",
    "the data tell us that properties of the higgs boson are consistent with those of the higgs boson in the sm within the current uncertainties .",
    "the discovery of @xmath1 does not directly mean that the true higgs sector is the sm higgs sector .",
    "in the sm , the higgs sector is assumed to be the minimum form to spontaneously break the @xmath2 gauge symmetry into @xmath3 .",
    "there are possibilities for extended structures of the higgs sector with some number and representation of additional higgs fields ; e.g. , models with the doublet field and additional singlet fields , doublet fields and/or triplet fields . these extended higgs sectors , like the sm higgs sector",
    ", can also explain the current lhc data for @xmath1 in some portions of their parameter regions .",
    "therefore it is important to determine the true higgs sector by future experiments .",
    "many of new physics models beyond the sm have characteristic extended higgs sectors .",
    "for example , by introducing additional higgs fields , new physics phenomena such as neutrino mass , baryon asymmetry of the universe and dark matter can be explained .",
    "there is a strong relation between the structure of the higgs sector and the new physics theory .",
    "when the true higgs sector is determined by future experiments , we can obtain an important hint for new physics .",
    "therefore , the study on the determination of the higgs sector is one of the most important studies of new physics",
    ".    it has been known that indirect tests for new physics can be performed by utilizing precision measurements of electroweak observables such as the electroweak oblique parameters at the lep / slc experiments . by the discovery of the higgs boson and the measurement of their properties ,",
    "the higgs boson couplings have been added to the list of such useful observables .",
    "it is important to study deviations of the higgs boson couplings from the sm predictions in various new physics models , because measurement accuracy of these coupling constants will be improved at future experiments such as the high - luminosity lhc ( hl - lhc ) and future electron - positron collider experiments . at the international linear collider ( ilc ) , most of the higgs couplings are expected to be measured with typically 1 @xmath4 or better accuracy  @xcite . in order to use these future precision measurements , we should calculate various higgs couplings as precisely as possible with radiative corrections . furthermore , by evaluating the pattern of deviations in the higgs couplings in each extended higgs sector , we may be able to distinguish extended higgs sector .    there have already been many studies on radiative corrections to the @xmath1 couplings in extended higgs sectors . in refs .",
