    "one of the quintessential properties of spatial structures is to support human navigation , or give cities , buildings etc .",
    "their _ navigability_. navigability in purely topological ( not spatially embedded ) graphs or networks have been studied , especially during the last decade of complex network research  @xcite .",
    "navigability in more relevant context of spatial networks  @xcite , however , is a more recent topic  @xcite . as a contribution to this topic ,",
    "we have introduced greedy spatial navigation ( gsn ) as a simple probe of the effects of human cognitive limitation to navigation in non - familiar environments  @xcite .",
    "the essence of gsn is the quantification of navigability for _ given _ spatial structures . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the reverse problem of _ giving _ spatial structures for better navigability .    in our previous work",
    ", we made the observation that a spring - embedding layout ( for better visualization ) actually helps the greedy navigators to find better routes compared to a random layout  @xcite .",
    "the difference is occasionally very large , depending on the network structure .",
    "this `` side effect '' comes from the property that layouts for visualization usually put topologically close vertex pairs geometrically close . in this paper",
    ", we study the layouts optimized solely for the better greedy navigability .",
    "in particular , we focus on geometric characteristics of optimized layouts compared to the aforementioned visualization oriented layouts .",
    "the optimization is done by simulated annealing ( sa ) process  @xcite .",
    "this will be further discussed in the next section .",
    "we begin the optimization procedure by assigning a random position for each vertex independently , inside square of unit length .",
    "the object function to minimize is the average steps greedy navigators take for all the vertex pairs as source  target ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) ones ( denoted as @xmath2 in ref .",
    "we use the sa  @xcite technique that repeatedly applies the heating and quenching processes . at each time step , the position of a randomly chosen vertex , whose coordinates are @xmath3 , is relocated to @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are randomly drawn from the interval @xmath7 $ ] ( @xmath8 ) uniformly . in the heating ( quenching ) process , such a trial movement is accepted if @xmath2 is decreased , while it is accepted with the probability @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) otherwise , respectively .",
    "this is similar to successful heuristic methods in combinatorial optimization  @xcite .",
    "the trial movement in the heating process is repeated for @xmath11 times in the unit of monte carlo ( mc ) steps , where one step is defined as @xmath12 ( the number of vertices ) trial movement .",
    "on the other hand , in the quenching process , the trial movement is repeated until consecutive @xmath13 times ( again , in the unit of mc steps ) of rejection occurs .",
    "overall , these consecutive heating and quenching processes as a single session are repeated @xmath14 times in total . finally , during this procedure , the layout @xmath15 corresponding to the minimum @xmath2 value up to present is recorded and constantly updated if a new minimum @xmath2 occurs . with the method ,",
    "after the sa procedure ends , we obtain the approximated optimal layout for gsn up to the moment .",
    "( @xmath16 ) for the optimal ( kk ) layout , respectively . ]     in the unit of mc steps @xmath17 , in case of the ba model used in fig .",

    "strogatz ( ws )  @xcite model graphs , where the average degree is set as @xmath26 for ba and hk and @xmath27 for ws graphs ( triangle formation probability for hk model is @xmath28 and the rewiring probability for ws model is @xmath29 ) . as an example of real - world graph , we analyze the social network of the oft - studied zachary karate club with @xmath30  @xcite . as representative examples of completely regular structures , the two - dimensional square lattice ( 2d square ) with the open boundary condition with @xmath31 and the one - dimensional ring ( 1d ring ) with @xmath25 and @xmath32 ( connected only with the nearest neighbors )",
    "are analyzed as well .",

    "[ ba_example](a ) and [ ba_time_series_example ] .",
    "graph ensembles are used to average for all the cases . ]     along the pathways , in the optimized ( a ) and kk ( b ) layout .",
    "at least @xmath33 graph ensembles are used to average for all the cases , and the horizontal axis is equipartitioned into @xmath34 bins . ]    in our further analysis we first investigate the angle ( defined as the undivided angles between edge pairs attached to each vertex  in fig .",
    "[ ba_example ] this is means we include @xmath35 and @xmath36 but not @xmath37 ) distributions of optimal layouts for gsn , in comparison to the spring - embedding kamada  kawai ( kk ) layout for the purpose of visualization  @xcite , as shown in fig .  [ angledist_opt_kk ] .",
    "an example of @xmath15 and time series of @xmath2 in case of the kk layout is shown in figs .",
    "[ ba_example](b ) and [ ba_time_series_example ] .",
    "even if it is demonstrated that the kk layout is helpful for gsn compared to the random navigation  @xcite , the optimal layout shows significantly different angular profiles to the ones in kk layout . in particular , much sharper angles dominate the former case , in contrast to the latter case composed of a certain range of characteristic angles for better visualization . among the optimized layouts , the graphs with hubs ( vertices with large numbers of neighbors ) such as the ba , hk , and karate club graphs , are obviously dominated by more sharper angles attached to the hubs than the ws graph case .    for a deeper investigation of gsn pathways ,",
    "we analyze the average distance ( number of edges in the shortest path to the target ) decreased along the gsn pathway .",
    "we denote this quantity as @xmath38 and present in fig .",
    "[ dx_avg ] , where the relative position in a pathway is denoted as the fraction @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) for the @xmath41th intermediate vertex . as seen , for all the graphs ,",
    "@xmath42 is larger for the kk layout than for the optimal layout in the early stage of the gsn pathways .",
    "however , the optimal pathway shows larger @xmath42 soon afterwards , which leads to better performance ( shorter gsn pathways ) .",
    "another aspect is the peak of @xmath38 for both the kk and optimal layouts , indicating the characteristic intermediate peak ( point of inefficiency ) in the gsn pathways .",
    "in contrast to the random graph models ( ba , hk , and ws ) and karate club graph , in case of the regular lattices ( 2d square and 1d ring ) the kk layout provides the exactly optimal layout for gsn , where the topological square lattice is mapped to a geometrical square lattice with almost right angles . this can be seen from the peaks of fig .",
    "[ angledist_opt_kk](b ) .",
    "the topological 1d ring network is laid out as a circle ( with almost straight angles as shown in the peak in fig .",
    "[ angledist_opt_kk](b ) ] , and by @xmath43 regardless of @xmath44 in fig .  [ dx_avg](b ) ) .",
    "the sa algorithm , however , shows a suboptimal performance for such regular structures as shown in figs .",
    "[ angledist_opt_kk](a ) and [ dx_avg](a ) , in contrast to the kk layout very good at detecting such regular structures .",
    "@xmath1 pair .",
    "each intermediate vertex s location in the gsn pathway of length @xmath45 ( arrows ) is compared to the corresponding intermediate points ( green dots ) equally spaced in the straight line ( red line ) .",
    "the deviation for each intermediate point is defined as the euclidean distance between the two points ( blue dashed lines ) , in the unit of the straight line . ]",
    "another way to explore the gsn pathways is to measure their straightness , by comparing the pathways to the straight line connecting @xmath0@xmath1 pairs .",
    "similar to the analysis of @xmath38 , we quantify the local straightness as a function of @xmath44 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dev_schematic ] .",
    "the deviation from the straight line connecting a @xmath0@xmath1 pair , represented as a vector @xmath46 from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , at @xmath44 is denoted as @xmath47the euclidean distance between the intermediate vertex at @xmath44 and the point at the same fraction @xmath44 on the straight line .",
    "note that all the distance measures for each @xmath0@xmath1 pair are scaled with respect to the length of the straight line ( @xmath48 ) , to facilitate the comparison between all the different paths and layouts .",
    "furthermore , each vector @xmath49 ( whose direction is from the point on the straight line to the vertex on the gsn pathway ) for the distance @xmath47 is decomposed into the component parallel to the straight line @xmath50 and the one perpendicular to it @xmath51 .",
    "due to the intrinsic directionality from the source to the target , @xmath50 can be positive or negative depending on the angle between @xmath46 and @xmath49 , and we take the positive value of @xmath51 for convenience .    for the optimized and kk layouts applied to the graphs we have used , values of average deviation from the straight lines as a function of @xmath44 are presented in fig .",
    "[ dev_from_lines]@xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 separately . from the results",
    ", we observe that in most cases the gsn pathways with kk layouts show much less deviation from the straight lines than with the optimized layouts . at a first glance , it may seem counterintuitive , because the gsn routes are shorter in the optimized except for 2d square and 1d ring cases .",
    "it is , however , reasonable if one recalls the fact that the path length is defined as the hopping distance ( number of edges along a pathway ) , so that optimized layouts can have much longer edges compared to the kk ones [ compare figs .",
    "[ ba_example](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "such longer edges amplify the entire length scale of optimized layouts compared to kk ones .",
    "therefore , in case of hopping - distance - based optimized layouts , the absolute values of deviation themselves are not quite comparable to different types of layouts",
    ". however , for a single type of layout , we can compare the effects of different graph topologies .",
    "for instance , the ( purely topological ) ba model shows the largest deviation in most cases , related to the amount of embedded geometric information  @xcite .",
    "the circular trajectories of gsn pathways in the 1d ring case are clearly reflected in the concave curves of @xmath47 and @xmath51 and the slightly negative ( positive ) @xmath50 for small ( large ) @xmath44 , respectively , for both optimized and kk layouts",
    ". it would be interesting if we adopt the alternative definition of path length , for instance , the sum of euclidean distance along the path  @xcite and compare the results .",
    "we have investigated the properties of optimized spatial graph layouts for gsn generated by a simple sa process . from the observed geometrical measures",
    ", it is shown that , in general , the optimized layouts are characterized by sharp angles and point of inefficiency in the middle of the gsn processes .",
    "these properties are qualitatively different from the layouts for better visualization , namely the kk ones , showing the dominating intermediate angles within characteristics ranges .",
    "a closer inspection of the navigational routes also reveals that the inefficiency of kk layouts soon follows its initially better performance compared to the optimized ones . in other words , our simulation shows that it is possible to generate gsn - friendly layouts other than the visualization - friendly layouts by just taking the simple sa optimization process .",
    "our simple sa optimization process , however , also shows its limitation by yielding the suboptimal results for completely regular structures such as the 1d ring and 2d square lattice , where the kk layouts happen to coincide with the exact solution of optimization for gsn .",
    "the sa optimization certainly gets close to the exact optimal layout , but not perfectly , at least in our simulation setting . besides such possible suboptimal performances , the observed properties of optimized layouts for better navigation can",
    ", we believe , give valuable hints for constructing various spatial structures in practice , e.g. , the urban planning and architecture  @xcite .",
    "adopting more sophisticated optimization processes and studies on diverse graph structures would be a natural candidate for the future work , for even better understanding of the tripartite relationship of topology - geometry - navigability .",
