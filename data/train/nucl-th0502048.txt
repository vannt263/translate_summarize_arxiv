    "the present study investigates a number of different models for the nuclear electromagnetic current derived from realistic interactions .",
    "the emphasis is on constructing two- and three - body currents which satisfy the current conservation relation ( ccr ) with the corresponding two- and three - nucleon interactions .",
    "two different methods are adopted to achieve this goal : one is based on meson - exchange mechanisms , the other uses minimal substitution in the explicit and implicit  through the isospin exchange operator  momentum dependence of the interactions . a by - product of this analysis is , in particular , the elucidation of the sense in which these two different methods are related to each other .    a variety of electromagnetic observables involving the @xmath5=2 and 3 nuclei",
    "are taken as case study for these current operator models , including the @xmath11@xmath9 radiative capture at thermal neutron energy , the deuteron photodisintegration at low energy , the magnetic form factors of @xmath3he and @xmath3h , and the @xmath11@xmath10 and @xmath9@xmath10 radiative captures .",
    "these processes have been extensively studied in the past by several research groups ( for a review , see ref .",
    "most recently , the authors of the present paper ( and collaborators ) have investigated the @xmath5=3 radiative capture reactions below deuteron breakup threshold in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the trinucleon form factors in ref .",
    "below , we briefly review those aspects of these earlier works that are more pertinent to the present study .    the @xmath5=3 bound- and scattering - state wave functions were obtained using the pair - correlated hyperspherical harmonics ( phh ) method  @xcite from a realistic hamiltonian model consisting of the argonne @xmath4 two - nucleon  @xcite and urbana ix three - nucleon interaction  @xcite ( av18/uix ) .",
    "this technique allows for the inclusion of the coulomb interaction in both the bound and scattering states .",
    "the nuclear electromagnetic current operator included , in addition to one - body convection and spin - magnetization terms , two- and three - body terms .",
    "the dominant two - body terms were constructed using meson - exchange mechanisms  @xcite from the momentum - independent part of the av18 , including the long - range pion - exchange component , and coincide with those derived here within the same approach .",
    "they satisfy the ccr with this part of the interaction .",
    "the two - body currents originating from the spin - orbit components of the av18 were constructed using again meson - exchange mechanisms  @xcite ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 exchanges for the isospin - independent , and @xmath14 exchange for the isospin dependent terms ) , while those from the quadratic momentum - dependent components were obtained by gauging only the momentum operators  @xcite , but ignoring the implicit momentum dependence which comes through the isospin exchange operator .",
    "the resulting currents are not strictly conserved .",
    "this lack of current conservation was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , but has not been sufficiently emphasized in subsequent papers , mostly because of the short - range character of these currents and their generally small associated contributions to photo- and electronuclear processes , for example see refs .",
    "the overcome of this limitation is one of the main aims of this work .",
    "earlier studies , as well as the present one , also take into account the two - body currents , associated with the @xmath15 and @xmath16 transition mechanisms and with the excitation of intermediate @xmath17 resonances ( for a review , see again ref .",
    ". however , these currents are purely transverse , and therefore unconstrained by the ccr .",
    "they are not the focus of the present work .",
    "the effects of @xmath17-isobar degrees of freedom in nuclear electroweak processes were studied more thoroughly in refs .",
    "@xcite , using two different approximations .",
    "one was based on first - order perturbation theory ( referred to above ) , while the other retained explicit one- and two-@xmath17 admixtures in the nuclear wave functions via the transition - correlation - operator ( tco ) method  @xcite .",
    "this latter approach is inherently non - perturbative .",
    "in particular , it generates three - body currents  @xcite , which are strictly not consistent with the three - nucleon interaction in the hamiltonian . in the present work",
    "these currents will be derived directly from the three - nucleon interaction , and will satisfy by construction the ccr with it .",
    "the derived new models for the electromagnetic current are tested in this paper on a variety of @xmath5=2 and 3 processes .",
    "the predictions for the @xmath0 radiative capture and deuteron electrodisintegration cross sections at low energies remain practically unchanged and are in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "for @xmath5=3 the situation is more interesting since the two - body currents play a very important role .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite it was found that two - body currents play a crucial role in reproducing the cross section and polarization observables measured in @xmath9@xmath10 and @xmath11@xmath10 radiative captures .",
    "however , some significant discrepancies remained unresolved . in the @xmath11@xmath10 case ,",
    "the theoretical prediction for the total cross section at thermal energies exceeds the experimental value by 14% . with the present model of the current , the overprediction",
    "is reduced to 9% .",
    "the origin of this overestimate is still puzzling , particularly in view of the fact that the astrophysical @xmath18-factor for the @xmath9@xmath10",
    "radiative capture at zero energy is calculated to be within 1%  @xcite of that extrapolated from cross section measurements in the range @xmath19 kev  @xcite .    in the @xmath9@xmath10 case , the calculated tensor observables @xmath20 and @xmath21 at center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of 2 mev  @xcite were found to be at variance with data . in that same work",
    ", it was also shown that these observables are sensitive to the small ( suppressed ) contributions arising from electric dipole transitions between the initial @xmath9@xmath10 @xmath22-wave scattering states with spin channel @xmath23 and the final @xmath3he bound state . when these contributions were calculated in the long - wavelength - approximation ( lwa ) using the siegert form of the @xmath24 operator ,",
    "the resulting tensor observables were much closer to the experimental values .",
    "since the year 2000 , more accurate phh wave functions have become available for the @xmath5=3 nuclei , and the calculations for @xmath2 radiative capture could be extended at energies above deuteron breakup threshold  @xcite . in preliminary calculations",
    "@xcite , we found that also at 3.33 mev the theory could not reproduce the precise data for the tensor polarization observables @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite . in the present work , it will be shown how the use of a conserved current indeed removes the discrepancy between theory and experiment for these observables .",
    "furthermore , the calculation has been extended up to 20 mev .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the theoretical predictions for the magnetic form factors of @xmath3he and @xmath3h were in satisfactory agreement with experimental data at low and moderate values of the momentum transfer .",
    "the first diffraction region , however , was poorly reproduced by the theoretical calculation , especially in the @xmath3he case .",
    "the three - body current operators , constructed within the tco approach , gave only very small contributions .",
    "this discrepancy is not resolved in the present study .",
    "alternative descriptions of the @xmath5=2 and 3 electromagnetic processes have been also recently reported .",
    "a conserved current model was developed by arenohvel and collaborators  @xcite and applied to @xmath5=2 reactions  @xcite .",
    "several groups are studying electromagnetic processes in the three - nucleon system . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the nucleons are taken as interacting via two- and three - nucleon potentials .",
    "the electromagnetic currents are then constructed using the meson exchange scheme for satisfying the ccr , but only with a part of the interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the meson exchange currents are taken into account using the siegert s theorem  @xcite .",
    "no three - body currents are considered in these works . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a nuclear model is employed which allows for the excitation of a nucleon to a @xmath17 isobar , and the two - body forces and currents are generated by the exchange of mesons .",
    "the @xmath17 excitation yields also effective three - body forces and three - body currents .",
    "however , this current model does not satisfy exactly the ccr with the adopted hamiltonian as discussed in ref .",
    "very recently , models of the currents derived from chiral lagrangians are starting to appear  @xcite .",
    "in all these calculations , the coulomb interaction between protons in the scattering state is disregarded .",
    "note that , in spite of the differences of the various approaches , the theoretical predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite and of this paper turn out to be , for most of the observables , quantitatively quite similar .",
    "an example will be presented for @xmath1 radiative capture , where the theoretical results are free from the uncertainty related to the omission of the coulomb interaction .",
    "also other approaches , as the lorentz integral transform technique  @xcite , have been applied to study the electromagnetic response of the trinucleon systems .",

    "<S> a number of low - energy electronuclear observables , including ( i ) @xmath0 radiative capture at thermal neutron energies and deuteron photodisintegration at low energies , ( ii ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 radiative capture reactions , and ( iii ) isoscalar and isovector magnetic form factors of @xmath3h and @xmath3he , are calculated in order to make a comparative study of these models for the current operator . </S>",
    "<S> the realistic argonne @xmath4 two - nucleon and urbana ix or tucson - melbourne three - nucleon interactions are taken as a case study . for @xmath5=3 processes , the bound and continuum wave functions , both below and above deuteron breakup threshold , are obtained with the correlated hyperspherical - harmonics method . </S>",
    "<S> three - body currents give small but significant contributions to some of the polarization observables in the @xmath6h(@xmath7)@xmath3he process and the @xmath6h(@xmath8)@xmath3h cross section at thermal neutron energies . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the use of a current which did not exactly satisfy current conservation with the two- and three - nucleon interactions in the hamiltonian was responsible for some of the discrepancies reported in previous studies between the experimental and theoretical polarization observables in @xmath9@xmath10 radiative capture . </S>"
