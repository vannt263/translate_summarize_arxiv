    "while our current knowledge on the partonic substructure of nucleons is obtained largely from deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments , the drell - yan process  @xcite , in which a charged lepton pair is produced in a hadron - hadron interaction via the electromagnetic @xmath4 process , also provides unique information on parton distributions .",
    "in particular , the drell - yan process has been used to determine the antiquark contents of nucleons and nuclei  @xcite , as well as the quark distributions of pions , kaons , and antiprotons  @xcite .",
    "such information is difficult , if not impossible , to obtain from dis experiments .",
    "as the drell - yan process can be well described by next - to - leading order qcd calculations  @xcite , a firm theoretical framework exists for utilizing the drell - yan process to extract the parton distributions .",
    "the study of the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions of the nucleon has received much attention in recent years as it provides new perspectives on the hadron structure and qcd  @xcite .",
    "these novel tmds can be extracted from semi - inclusive deep - inelastic ( sidis ) scattering experiments .",
    "recent measurements of the sidis by the hermes  @xcite and compass  @xcite collaborations have shown clear evidence for the existence of the t - odd sivers functions .",
    "these data also allow the first determination  @xcite of the magnitude and flavor structure of the sivers functions and the nucleon transversity distributions .",
    "the tmd and transversity parton distributions can also be probed in drell - yan experiments . as pointed out  @xcite long time ago , the double transverse spin asymmetry in polarized drell - yan , @xmath5 , is proportional to the product of transversity distributions , @xmath6 . the single transverse spin asymmetry , @xmath7 , is sensitive to the sivers function  @xcite , @xmath8 of the polarized proton ( beam or target ) .",
    "even unpolarized drell - yan experiments can be used to probe the tmd distribution function , since the cos@xmath9 azimuthal angular dependence is proportional to the product of two boer - mulders functions  @xcite , @xmath10 .",
    "a unique feature of the drell - yan process is that , unlike the sidis , no fragmentation functions are involved .",
    "therefore , the drell - yan process provides an entirely independent technique for measuring the tmd functions .",
    "furthermore , the proton - induced drell - yan process is sensitive to the sea - quark tmds and can lead to flavor separation of tmds when combined with the sidis data .",
    "finally , the intriguing prediction  @xcite that the t - odd tmds extracted from dis will have a sign - change for the drell - yan process remains to be tested experimentally .    in this article , we first present the measurement of drell - yan azimuthal angular distributions in the fermilab experiment e866 .",
    "implication of the data on the tmd boer - mulders function is discussed .",
    "prospects for future drell - yan experiments for studying tmd and transversity distributions at fermilab and j - parc will also be discussed .",
    "during the last two decades , a series of fixed - target dimuon production experiments ( e772 , e789 , e866 ) have been carried out using 800 gev / c proton beam at fermilab . at 800 gev / c ,",
    "the dimuon data contain drell - yan continuum up to dimuon mass of @xmath11 gev as well as quarkonium ( j/@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 resonances ) productions . the drell - yan process and quarkonium productions often provide complementary information , since drell - yan is an electromagnetic process via quark - antiquark annihilation while the quarkonium production is a strong interaction process dominated by gluon - gluon fusion at this beam energy .",
    "the fermilab dimuon experiments cover a broad range of physics topics .",
    "the drell - yan data have provided informations on the antiquark distributions in the nucleons  @xcite and nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these results showed the surprising results that the antiquark distributions in the nuclei are not enhanced  @xcite , contrary to the predictions of models which explain the emc effect in term of nuclear enhancement of exchanged mesons .",
    "moreover , the drell - yan cross section ratios @xmath15 clearly establish the flavor asymmetry of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 distributions in the proton , and they map out the @xmath18-dependence of this asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis of the @xmath14 production cross section ratios for @xmath15 has shown that the gluon distributions in proton and neutron are very similar  @xcite .",
    "pronounced nuclear dependences of quarkonium productions as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath20 have been observed for j/@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 resonances  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear drell - yan cross sections also exhibit @xmath19 as well as @xmath20 dependences  @xcite , which are weaker than the quarkonium nuclear dependences but can provide information on the energy loss of quarks traversing the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "several review articles covering some of these results are available  @xcite . in the following , we will focus on the recent results from experiment e866 on the measurement of angular distributions of the drell - yan cross sections .      despite the success of perturbative qcd in describing the drell - yan cross sections , it remains a challenge to understand the angular distributions of the drell - yan process .",
    "assuming dominance of the single - photon process , a general expression for the drell - yan angular distribution is  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the polar and azimuthal angle , respectively , of the @xmath24 in the dilepton rest frame . in the  naive \" drell - yan model , where the transverse momentum of the quark is ignored and no gluon emission",
    "is considered , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are obtained .",
    "qcd effects  @xcite and non - zero intrinsic transverse momentum of the quarks  @xcite can both lead to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "however , @xmath29 and @xmath30 should still satisfy the relation @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "this so - called lam - tung relation , obtained as a consequence of the spin-1/2 nature of the quarks , is analogous to the callan - gross relation  @xcite in deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "the first measurement of the drell - yan angular distribution was performed by the na10 collaboration for @xmath32 with the highest statistics at 194 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 angular dependences showed a sizable @xmath30 , increasing with dimuon transverse momentum ( @xmath20 ) and reaching a value of @xmath33 at @xmath34 gev / c .",
    "the fermilab e615 collaboration subsequently performed a measurement of @xmath32 drell - yan production at 252 gev / c with broad coverage in the decay angle @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the e615 data showed that the lam - tung relation , @xmath35 , is clearly violated .",
    "the na10 and e615 results on the drell - yan angular distributions strongly suggest that new effects beyond conventional perturbative qcd are present .",
    "brandenburg , nachtmann and mirke suggested that a factorization - breaking qcd vacuum may lead to a correlation between the transverse spin of the antiquark in the pion and that of the quark in the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "this would result in a non - zero @xmath36 angular dependence consistent with the data .",
    "several authors have also considered higher - twist effects from quark - antiquark binding in pions  @xcite . however , the model is strictly applicable only in the @xmath37 region , while the na10 and e615 data exhibit nonperturbative effects over a much broader kinematic region .",
    "more recently , boer pointed out  @xcite that the @xmath2 angular dependences observed in na10 and e615 could be due to the @xmath38-dependent parton distribution function @xmath3 .",
    "this so - called boer - mulders function  @xcite is an example of a novel type of @xmath38-dependent parton distribution function , and it characterizes the correlation of a quark s transverse spin and its transverse momentum , @xmath38 , in an unpolarized nucleon .",
    "the boer - mulders function is the chiral - odd analog of the sivers function and owes its existence to the presence of initial / final state interactions  @xcite .",
    "while the sivers function is beginning to be quantitatively determined from the sidis experiments , very little is known about the boer - mulders function so far .",
    "several model calculations have been carried out for the boer - mulders functions . in the quark - diquark model",
    ", it was shown that the boer - mulders functions are identical to the sivers functions when only the scalar diquark configuration is considered  @xcite .",
    "more recently , calculations taking into account both the scalar and the axial - vector diquark configurations found significant differences between the sivers and boer - mulders functions  @xcite . in particular , the @xmath39 and @xmath40 quark boer - mulders functions are predicted to be both negative , while the sivers function is negative for the @xmath39 quark and positive for the @xmath40 quark .",
    "other calculations using the mit bag model  @xcite , the relativistic constituent quark model  @xcite , the large-@xmath41 model  @xcite , and the lattice qcd  @xcite also predicted negative signs for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 boer - mulders functions .",
    "burkardt recently pointed out  @xcite that the origin of the negative signs for the boer - mulders functions lies in the phase of the @xmath42-wave lower component relative to the @xmath43-wave upper component of the quark wave function for the solution to the free dirac equation .",
    "the model predictions for the same signs of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 boer - mulders functions remain to be tested experimentally .",
    "to shed additional light on the origins of the na10 and e615 drell - yan angular distributions , we recently analyzed @xmath0 and @xmath1 drell - yan angular distribution data at 800 gev / c from fermilab e866 .",
    "there had been no report on the azimuthal angular distributions for proton - induced drell - yan  all measurements were for polar angular distributions  @xcite .",
    "proton - induced drell - yan data provide a test of theoretical models .",
    "for example , the @xmath36 dependence is expected to be much reduced in proton - induced drell - yan if the underlying mechanism involves the boer - mulders functions .",
    "this is due to the expectation that the boer - mulders functions are small for the sea - quarks  @xcite .",
    "however , if the qcd vacuum effect  @xcite is the origin of the @xmath2 angular dependence , then the azimuthal behavior of proton - induced drell - yan should be similar to that of pion - induced drell - yan .",
    "finally , the validity of the lam - tung relation has never been tested for proton - induced drell - yan , and the present study provides a first test .",
    "the fermilab e866 experiment was performed using the upgraded meson - east magnetic pair spectrometer .",
    "an 800 gev / c primary proton beam with up to @xmath44 protons per 20-second beam spill was incident upon 50.8 cm long target flask containing either liquid hydrogen , liquid deuterium or vacuum .",
    "the detector system consisted of four tracking stations and a momentum analyzing magnet . from the momenta of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 , kinematic variables of the dimuons ( @xmath47 ) were readily reconstructed . the muon angles @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the collins - soper frame  @xcite were also calculated . to remove the quarkonium background , only events with @xmath48 gev / c@xmath49 or @xmath50 gev / c@xmath49 were analyzed .",
    "a total of @xmath5154,000 @xmath0 and @xmath51118,000 p+d drell - yan events covering the decay angular range @xmath52 and @xmath53 remain .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath2 dependence for the @xmath1 drell - yan cross sections has already been reported  @xcite . as shown in fig . 1 , significantly smaller ( but non - zero ) cos@xmath9 azimuthal angular dependence was observed in the @xmath1 reaction . while pion - induced drell - yan process is dominated by annihilation between a valence antiquark in the pion and a valence quark in the nucleon ,",
    "proton - induced drell - yan process involves a valence quark annihilating with a sea antiquark in the nucleon .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 result suggests  @xcite that the boer - mulders functions for sea antiquarks are significantly smaller than those for valence quarks .",
    "a recent analysis  @xcite of the @xmath1 @xmath2 data showed that the sea - quark boer - mulders functions are indeed smaller by a factor @xmath54 than the valence - quark boer - mulders functions .",
    "this analysis also indicated that the e866 @xmath1 data are consistent with the @xmath39 and @xmath40 boer - mulders functions having the same signs , as predicted by various models .",
    "however , the @xmath1 data alone can not provide an unambiguous determination of the flavor dependence of the boer - mulders functions .",
    "moreover , it was recently pointed out  @xcite that qcd processes would lead to sizeable @xmath36 effect which has not been taken into account in the extractions  @xcite of boer - mulders functions from the drell - yan data .",
    "the @xmath0 drell - yan data should provide further constraints on the flavor dependence of the boer - mulders functions  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data with the prediction of qcd .",
    "figure 2 shows the angular distribution parameters @xmath55 and @xmath30 vs.  @xmath20 for the e866 @xmath0 and @xmath1 drell - yan data . within statistics , the angular distributions of @xmath0",
    "are consistent with those of @xmath1 . also shown in fig .",
    "2 is the quantity @xmath56 , which should vanish if the lam - tung relation is valid .",
    "figure 2 shows that the lam - tung relation is indeed quite well satisfied within statistics .",
    "this is different from the observation of a significant violation of the lam - tung relation by the e615 collabortaion in the @xmath32 reaction at 252 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the parameter @xmath30 vs.  @xmath20 for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 drell - yan data .",
    "the solid curves are calculations  @xcite for @xmath0 and @xmath1 using parametrizations based on a fit to the @xmath1 drell - yan data .",
    "the larger values of @xmath30 for @xmath0 compared to @xmath1 are in qualitative agreement with the prediction .",
    "however , the shape of the predicted @xmath20 dependence is different from the data .",
    "this strongly suggests that there could be other mechanisms contributing to the @xmath36 azimuthal angular dependence at large @xmath20 region . in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "the qcd contribution to the @xmath36 azimuthal angular dependence is given as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the dimuon transverse momentum .",
    "the predicted qcd contribution is shown as the dotted curve is fig .",
    "although neither the prediction based on boer - mulders functions nor the qcd prediction could describe the entire range of @xmath20 , it is evident that the qcd contribution becomes important at high @xmath20 and the boer - mulders functions contribute at lower @xmath20 .",
    "an analysis combining both effects is required before a reliable extraction of the boer - mulders functions could be obtained .",
    "future fixed - target dimuon experiments have been proposed at the 120 gev fermilab main injector ( fmi ) and the 50 gev j - parc facilities .",
    "the fermilab proposal  @xcite , e906 , has been approved and is expected to start data - taking around 2011 . two dimuon proposals ( p04  @xcite and p24  @xcite ) have also been submitted to the j - parc for approval .",
    "the lower beam energies at fmi and j - parc present opportunities for extending the drell - yan measurements to larger @xmath18 ( @xmath59 ) . for given values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",
    "the drell - yan cross section is proportional to @xmath62 , hence a gain of @xmath63 times in the drell - yan cross sections can be obtained at the j - parc energy of 50 gev .",
    "this would extend the measurement of boer - mulders functions to larger @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , the nuclear dependence of the boer - mulders functions can also be measured .    the dimuon physics program at j - parc is proposed to be carried out in several stages . since 30 gev proton beam will be available at the initial phase of j - parc , the first measurements will focus on @xmath64 production at 30 gev .",
    "this will be followed by measurements of drell - yan and quarkonium production at 50 gev after the beam energy is upgraded to 50 gev .",
    "experiments using polarized target could already be performed with unpolarized beams .",
    "when polarized proton beam becomes available at j - parc , a rich and unique program on spin physics could also be pursued at j - parc using the dimuon spectrometer .",
    "an important feature of @xmath64 production using 30 or 50 gev proton beam is the dominance of the quark - antiquark annihilation subprocess .",
    "this is in striking contrast to @xmath64 production at 800 gev ( fermilan e866 ) or at 120 gev ( fermilab e906 ) , where the gluon - gluon fusion is the dominant process .",
    "this suggests an exciting opportunity to use @xmath64 production at j - parc as an alternative method to probe antiquark distribution .    with the possibility to accelerate polarized proton beams at j - parc , the spin structure of the proton",
    "can also be investigated with the proposed dimuon experiments .",
    "in particular , polarzied drell - yan process with polarized beam and/or polarized target at j - parc would allow a unique program on spin physics complementary to polarized dis experiments and the rhic - spin program .",
    "specific physics topics include the measurements of t - odd boer - mulders distribution function in unpolarized drell - yan , the extraction of t - odd sivers distribution functions in singly transversely polarized drell - yan , the helicity distribution of antiqaurks in doubly longitudinally polarized drell - yan , and the transversity distribution in doubly transversely polarized drell - yan .",
    "it is worth noting that polarized drell - yan is one of the major physics program at the gsi polarized antiproton experiment ( pax ) .",
    "the rhic - spin program will likely provide the first results on polarized drell - yan .",
    "however , the high luminosity and the broad kinematic coverage for the large-@xmath18 region at j - parc would allow some unique measurements to be performed in the j - parc dimuon experiments .",
    "i am very grateful to lingyan zhu , paul reimer , and my collaborators on the e772 , e789 , and e866 experiments at fermilab .",
    "illuminating comments from matthias burkardt , feng yuan , bo - qiang ma , werner vogelsang , and jianwei qiu are greatly appreciated .",
    "i would also like to acknowledge the collaboration with shinya sawada and yuji goto on the j - parc dimuon proposals",

    "<S> the roles of the drell - yan experiments in studying the transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> recent results from the fermilab e866 experiment on the angular distributions of drell - yan dimuons in @xmath0 and @xmath1 at 800 gev / c are presented . </S>",
    "<S> these data are compared with the pion - induced drell - yan data , and with models which attribute the @xmath2 azimuthal distribution to the presence of the transverse - momentum - dependent boer - mulders structure function @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on the magnitude of the sea - quark @xmath3 structure functions are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> future prospects for studying the tmds with drell - yan experiments at fermilab and j - parc are also discussed . </S>"
