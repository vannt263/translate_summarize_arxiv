    "electric dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) is a method to electrically manipulate electron spins . in this technique ,",
    "two fields are applied ; a static magnetic field @xmath0 and an oscillating electric field @xmath1 resonant with the electron precession ( larmor ) frequency  @xcite .",
    "spin resonance techniques are of interest for quantum computing schemes based on single electron spins , because they allow arbitrary one - qubit operations  @xcite .",
    "single - spin edsr is a particularly desirable experimental tool because it allows spin manipulation without time - dependent magnetic fields , which are difficult to generate and localize at the nanoscale  @xcite .",
    "achieving edsr requires a mechanism to couple @xmath2 to the electron spin .",
    "this coupling can be achieved by the traditional spin - orbit interaction , which couples to the electron momentum @xmath3 , or by an inhomogeneous zeeman interaction , which couples to the electron coordinate @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "single - spin edsr has recently been achieved in quantum dots using both techniques  @xcite .",
    "recently , we presented an experimental and theoretical study of a novel edsr effect mediated by the spatial inhomogeneity of the hyperfine nuclear field  @xcite .",
    "an electron moving under the influence of the electric field @xmath1 experiences this inhomogeneity as an oscillating hyperfine coupling which drives spin transitions . in this paper , we illuminate the underlying physics and present new experimental data on a still unexplained phenomenon at half the resonant frequency .    this edsr effect is observed via spin - blocked transitions in a few - electron gaas double quantum dot  @xcite . as expected for a hyperfine mechanism , but in contrast to the @xmath5-coupling mediated edsr , the resonance strength is independent of @xmath0 at low field and shows , when averaged over nuclear configurations , no rabi oscillations as a function of time . we find that at large @xmath0 driving the resonance creates a nuclear polarization , which we interpret as the backaction of edsr on the nuclei  @xcite .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that spins can be individually addressed in each dot by creating a local field gradient .",

    "voltages applied to ti / au top gates locally deplete the 2deg , defining a few - electron double quantum dot . a nearby charge sensing quantum point contact ( qpc ) is sensitive to the electron occupation @xmath16 of the left @xmath17 and right @xmath18 dots  @xcite .",
    "the voltages @xmath19 and @xmath20 on gates l and r can be rapidly pulsed ; in addition , l is coupled to a microwave source .",
    "the static magnetic field @xmath21 was applied in the plane of the heterostructure , and measurements were performed in a dilution refrigerator at 150  mk electron temperature .",
    "the characteristic feature of tunnel - coupled quantum dots is a discrete electron energy spectrum .",
    "an overall shift to the spectrum , proportional to the electron occupation , is induced by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which therefore determine which occupation is energetically favoured .",
    "figure  1(b ) shows the qpc conductance @xmath7 as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; different conductances correspond to different ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "for most @xmath25 configurations , only one value of @xmath16 is energetically accessible ; these correspond in figure  1(b ) to regions of uniform @xmath26 .",
    "a bias @xmath27 applied across the device drives electron transport via sequential tunneling subject to two constraints  @xcite .",
    "the first constraint , coulomb blockade , arises because for most gate configurations electrostatic repulsion prevents additional electrons from tunneling onto either dot .",
    "this constraint inhibits transport except when @xmath25 are tuned so that three occupation configurations are near - degenerate .",
    "the energy cost of an extra electron tunneling through the device is then small enough to be provided by the bias voltage .",
    "values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfying this condition correspond to the two white dashed triangular regions marked in figure 1(b ) , for which transport is permitted via the transition sequences @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "a second constraint , spin blockade , is caused by the pauli exclusion principle , which leads to an intra - dot exchange energy @xmath30 in the right dot  @xcite .",
    "as shown in the first panel of figure 1(c ) , the effect of this exchange is to make the @xmath31 transition selective in the two - electron spin state , inhibited for triplet states but allowed for the singlet .",
    "although the hyperfine field difference between dots rapidly converts the @xmath32 component @xmath33 of the blocked triplet @xmath34 to an unblocked singlet @xmath35 , decay of @xmath36 components @xmath37 requires a spin flip and therefore proceeds much more slowly .",
    "this spin flip becomes the rate - limiting step in transport , and so the time - averaged occupation is dominated by the ( 1,1 ) portion of the transport sequence @xcite .",
    "gate configurations where spin blockade applies correspond to the black solid outlined region of figure 1(b ) ; inside this region , @xmath7 has the value corresponding to ( 1,1 ) .",
    "any process that induces spin flips will partially break spin blockade and lead to a decrease in @xmath7 .",
    "unless stated otherwise , edsr is detected via changes in @xmath7 while the following cycle of voltage pulses @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xcite is applied to l and r ( figure  1(c ) ) .",
    "the cycle begins inside the spin blockade region ( m in figure  1(b ) ) , so that the two - electron state is initialized to @xmath38 with high probability .",
    "a @xmath391  @xmath40s pulse to point c prevents electron tunneling regardless of spin state . towards the end of this pulse ,",
    "a microwave burst of duration @xmath41 at frequency  @xmath42 is applied to gate l. finally the system is brought back to m for @xmath393  @xmath40s for readout / reinitialization . if and only if a spin ( on either dot ) was flipped during the pulse , the transition @xmath31 occurs , leading to a change in average occupation and in @xmath7 .",
    "if this transition occurs , subsequent electron transitions reinitialize the state to @xmath38 by the end of this step , after which the pulse cycle is repeated .",
    "this pulsed edsr scheme has the advantage of separating spin manipulation from readout .",
    "changes in @xmath7 are monitored via the voltage @xmath43 across the qpc sensor biased at 5  na .",
    "for increased sensitivity , the microwaves are chopped at 227  hz and the change in voltage @xmath44 is synchronously detected using a lock - in amplifier .",
    "we interpret @xmath44 as proportional to the spin - flip probability during a microwave burst , averaged over the 100  ms lock - in time constant .",

    "a theoretical description of @xmath57 and its dependence on @xmath45 and @xmath51 can be obtained by modeling edsr as arising from the coupling of an electron in a single dot to an oscillating electric field @xmath1 and the hyperfine field of an ensemble of nuclei  @xcite .",
