    "symplectic capacities are an important tool in the study of symplectic rigidity phenomena .",
    "these were introduced and axiomatized by ekeland and hofer @xcite , though the first one was constructed previously by gromov @xcite .",
    "many such capacities exist  arguably , each phenomenon of symplectic rigidity gives rise to its own capacity .",
    "a large number of examples are described in @xcite , and relationships between them , notably energy - capacity inequalities , lead to interesting connections between hamiltonian dynamics and symplectic topology .",
    "very little is known about capacities defined relative to special submanifolds @xmath0 of a symplectic manifold , and , indeed , even in the lagrangian case there are many open questions .",
    "barraud and cornea introduced the first relative capacities ( in the lagrangian case ) , the lagrangian gromov width and relative packing numbers @xcite .",
    "upper bounds for the lagrangian gromov width of the clifford torus in @xmath1 were computed by biran and cornea@xcite .",
    "buhovsky @xcite later showed lower bounds for the clifford torus .",
    "schlenk s constructions @xcite also work in the relative case , and therefore compute the relative packing numbers for @xmath2 balls in @xmath3 . in @xcite ,",
    "the second author defined a blow - up and blow - down procedure for lagrangian submanifolds , and used it to compute the relative gromov radius of a class of lagrangians that are fixed point sets of real , rank-@xmath4 symplectic manifolds . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "zehmisch constructed a capacity of a manifold @xmath5 from embeddings of @xmath6-disk bundles over a lagrangian submanifold and subsequently related it to the geometry of the lagrangian .",
    "finally , in @xcite , borman and mclean construct a spectral capacity for wrapped floer homology , and use it to study the relative gromov width of closed lagrangian submanifolds in liouville manifolds .    in this paper",
    ", we study a notion of a capacity relative to a coisotropic submanifold , which we call a coisotropic capacity . in a heuristic sense ,",
    "if a symplectic capacity measures the width of a symplectic manifold , our coisotropic capacity similarly measures the symplectic size of a coisotropic embedding inside an ambient symplectic manifold . after discussing the general notions ,",
    "we define a new capacity relative to a coistropic submaifold via hamiltonian dynamics on the ambient symplectic manifold in a manner analogous to the definition of the hofer - zehnder capacity @xcite .",
    "our proof is obtained as a modification of their variational proof .",
    "the main innovations in the proof are to consider a function space better suited to the relative problem , which also requires us to consider a different extension of the hamiltonian .",
    "our extension introduces some new subtleties to the argument , which we emphasize in our discussion .    as an application of the existence of our capacity ,",
