    "these values of k were chosen , because the range of temperatures where reliable extrapolation of the behaviour of physical quantities could be performed included positions of the maxima of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility and the position of the phase transition in the bulk system .",

    "the ratio of critical exponents @xmath63 and @xmath64 we determined from the fss behaviour of the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility . they are consistent with values obtained in the two - dimensional lattice ising model . in annealed diluted magnets",
    "the exponents are renormalized if the pure specific - heat exponent @xmath86 is positive and do not change if it is negative @xcite . as for the pure lattice ising model @xmath87",
    ", we expect for the annealed diluted ising models the pure ising exponents .",
    "our results disagree with this prediction and suggests a renormalization of exponents which leaves @xmath63 and @xmath64 unchanged and changes @xmath29 .",
    "we were unable to consider large system sizes with good statistics to determine possible corrections to finite - size scaling .",
    "however , the presented self - consistency in the determination of @xmath37 using the estimated exponent @xmath29 convinces one that the obtained values of @xmath29 and @xmath88 are correct .",
