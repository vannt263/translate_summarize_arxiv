    "given an autonomous nonlinear system and a target set , the region of attraction ( roa ) is the set of all states that end in the target set at a given time without leaving the state constraint set .",
    "the roa is one of the principal sets associated to any dynamical system and goes by many other names in the literature ( e.g. , backward reachable set or capture basin  @xcite ) .    in  @xcite we showed ( in a controlled setting ) that there is a genuinely primal convex characterization of the roa .",
    "optimization over system trajectories is formulated as optimization over occupation measures , leading to an infinite dimensional linear programming ( lp ) problem in the cone of nonnegative measures .",
    "finite dimensional relaxations of the dual of this problem then provide a converging sequence of _ outer _ approximations to the roa . for a description of alternative techniques for numerical approximations of the roa",
    ", please consult @xcite or @xcite and the many references therein .    in this paper",
    "we show , within the same measure - theoretic framework , that there exists an infinite dimensional lp whose finite - dimensional relaxations provide a converging sequence of _ inner _ approximations to the roa .",
    "this paper can therefore be seen as a complement to  @xcite . to simplify our developments and to emphasize our contribution",

    "the main idea is to construct a converging sequence of outer approximations to the _ complement _ of the roa .",
    "there are certain difficulties , topological in nature , associated with this approach .",
    "a careful distinction had to be made between trajectories leaving the constraint set and trajectories hitting its boundary .",
    "this then translates to a ( sometimes subtle , but necessary ) distinction between open and closed semialgebraic sets .",
    "fortunately , the lp formulation proposed in @xcite was flexible enough to allow for these modifications .    generally speaking , and consistently with our previous work @xcite , we believe that the main virtues of our approach are overall convexity , conceptual simplicity and compactness .",
    "both primal and dual finite - dimensional relaxations turn out to be linear matrix inequalities ( lmi ) , also called semidefinite programming ( sdp ) problems , with no tuning parameters besides the relaxation order and no initialization data besides the defining ingredients of the problem .",
    "in addition , the inner approximations obtained are particularly simple  they are given by a sublevel set of a single polynomial of a predefined degree .",

    "therefore , it suffices to restrict the test functions @xmath136 and @xmath50 in ( [ rrlp ] ) to all monomials , reducing the linear equality constraints of  ( [ rrlp ] ) to linear equality constraints on the moments .",

    "by truncating the moment sequence and taking only the moments corresponding to monomials of total degree less than or equal to @xmath137 we obtain a necessary condition for this truncated moment sequence to be the first part of a moment sequence of a measure with the desired support .",
    "this procedure leads to the primal sdp relaxation of order @xmath135 @xmath138 where the notation @xmath139 stands for positive semidefinite and the minimum is over moment sequences @xmath140 truncated to degree @xmath137 corresponding to measures @xmath34 , @xmath63 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath85 .",

    "both techniques are illustrated in figure  [ fig : loworde ] ; in figure  [ fig : loworde ]  ( a ) we consider the univariate cubic dynamics and we both shrink the constraint set @xmath12 and choose low order @xmath131 while keeping @xmath41 of higher order . in figure",
    "[ fig : loworde ]  ( b ) we consider the van der pol oscillator , keeping the constraint set @xmath12 unchanged and only selecting low order @xmath131 .",
    "the inner approximations obtained are indeed significantly tighter for the given degrees ( compare with figures  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "this paper presented an infinite dimensional convex characterization of the region of attraction ( roa ) for uncontrolled polynomial systems , following the approach initiated in our previous work @xcite .",
    "finite dimensional dual relaxations yield a converging sequence of inner approximations to the roa , thereby complementing the outer approximations of @xcite .",
    "one of the virtues of the approach is its conceptual simplicity  the resulting approximation is the outcome of a single sdp or lmi problem with no free parameters except for the relaxation order .",
    "the approximations itself are also simple , given by sublevel sets of polynomials of predefined degrees .",
    "nevertheless , this approach does not escape the curse of dimensionality  indeed , whereas the number of variables of the lmi relaxations grows polynomially with the relaxation order , this number grows exponentially with the state dimension .",
    "tailored structure - exploiting sdp solvers could enable this approach to reach higher dimensions .",
    "in addition , a different choice of basis functions ( e.g. , chebyshev polynomials rather than monomials ) would improve numerical conditioning of the lmis , allowing higher oder relaxations to be computed .",
    "future research directions include inner approximations in a controlled setting and the related problem of robust region of attraction / reachable set computation with either unknown but constant uncertainty or a time - varying disturbance .",
    "the cases of asymptotic region of attraction and maximum ( controlled ) positively invariant set computation are amenable to similar tools .",

    "<S> in a previous work we developed a convex infinite dimensional linear programming ( lp ) approach to approximating the region of attraction ( roa ) of polynomial dynamical systems subject to compact basic semialgebraic state constraints . </S>",
    "<S> finite dimensional relaxations to the infinite - dimensional lp lead to a truncated moment problem in the primal and a polynomial sum - of - squares problem in the dual . </S>",
    "<S> this primal - dual linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) problem can be solved numerically with standard semidefinite programming solvers , producing a hierarchy of outer ( i.e. exterior ) approximations of the roa by polynomial sublevel sets , with a guarantee of almost uniform and set - wise convergence . in this companion paper , we show that our approach is flexible enough to be modified so as to generate a hierarchy of polynomial inner ( i.e.interior ) approximations of the roa with similar convergence guarantees . </S>"
