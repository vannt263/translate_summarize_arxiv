    "the study of brownian motion on a riemannian manifold shows that the short - time and long - time asymptotic behavior of the process strongly reflects the geometry of the underlying manifold . considering the importance of heat kernels in riemannian geometry",
    ", it appears very natural to investigate the links between geometry and asymptotics of brownian paths in a lorentzian setting . in his seminal work @xcite , r.m .",
    "dudley showed that a relativistic diffusion , _",
    "i.e. _ a diffusion process with values in a lorentz manifold whose law is lorentz - covariant , can not exist in the base space , but makes sense at the level of the tangent bundle .",
    "more precisely , dudley showed that there is no lorentz - covariant diffusion in the minkowski space - time but that there exists a unique lorentz - covariant diffusion with values in its ( pseudo)-unitary tangent bundle .",
    "this process , that we will name _ dudley s diffusion _ in the sequel , is simply obtained by integrating the classical hyperbolic brownian motion on the unitary tangent space .    in @xcite , j. franchi and y. le jan",
    "extend dudley s construction to the realm of general relativity by defining , on the future - directed half of the unitary tangent bundle @xmath0 of an arbitrary lorentz manifold @xmath1 , a diffusion which is lorentz - covariant .",
    "this process , that we will simply call _ relativistic diffusion _ , is the lorentzian analogue of the classical brownian motion on a riemannian manifold .",
    "it can be seen either as a random perturbation of the timelike geodesic flow on the unitary tangent bundle , or as a stochastic development of dudley s diffusion in a fixed tangent space , see sect .",
    "3 of @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "franchi and le jan generalized their construction by introducing the so - called `` curvature diffusions '' , whose quadratic variation is allowed to depend locally on the curvature of the underlying space - time .    in the case when the underlying manifold is the minkowski space - time , the long - time asymptotic behavior of the above relativistic diffusion is well understood .",
    "it was first studied by dudley himself in @xcite where it is shown that the process is transient , and escapes to infinity in a random preferred direction . in @xcite ,",
    "i. bailleul completed dudley s results by performing the full determination of the poisson boundary of the relativistic diffusion , _",
    "i.e. _ the set of bounded harmonic functions on the minkowski phase space endowed with the differential operator which is the infinitesimal generator of the diffusion . recall that this is equivalent to the determination of the invariant @xmath2-field of the natural filtration of the relativistic diffusion .",
    "moreover , bailleul gave a geometric description of the poisson boundary of the relativistic diffusion which can be formulated in terms of the causal boundary of minkowski space - time .",
    "as for the usual brownian motion on a general riemannian manifold , there is no hope to fully determine the asymptotic behavior of the relativistic diffusion on an arbitrary lorentzian manifold : it could depend heavily on the base space , see e.g. @xcite and its references in the case of cartan  hadamard manifolds .",
    "in fact , the difficulty is a priori greater in the lorentzian context : first because of the non - positivity of the underlying metric , then because the relativistic diffusion does not live on the base manifold , but on its pseudo - unit tangent bundle , so that it is basically seven - dimensional when the base manifold have four dimensions , and there is no general reason for which it must contain one or more lower - dimensional sub - diffusions . on the contrary ,",
    "recall that in the case of a constantly curved riemannian manifold , the brownian motion fortunately always admits a one - dimensional sub - diffusion : the radial sub - diffusion .",
    "nevertheless , the study of the relativistic diffusion has been led in details in a few examples of lorentzian manifolds .",
    "thereby , in @xcite and @xcite , the authors studied the long - time behavior of the diffusion in schwarzschild - kruskal - szekeres space - time and gdel space - time respectively .",
    "although they did not reach the full determination of the poisson boundary , they achieved to describe the almost sure asymptotics of diffusion s paths and came up with the conclusion that they asymptotically behave like random light - like geodesics .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform a detailed study of the long - time asymptotic behavior of the relativistic diffusion in the case when the underlying space - time belong to a large class of lorentz manifolds : robertson - walker space - times , or rw space - times for short , see sect .",
    "[ sec.rw ] .",
    "this class of lorentzian manifolds offers the advantage of being very rich ( e.g. , rw space - times can be spatially compact / non compact , geometrically complete / non complete etc . ) , yet the geometry of these space - times remains quite simple ( one can for example explicitly integrate the geodesic equations ) .",
    "we fully caracterize the asympotic behavior of the diffusion in terms of geometric properties at infinity of the base manifold .",
    "we show in particular that the relativistic diffusion s paths converge almost surely to random points of the causal boundary @xmath3 ( see sect . [ sec.rw ] and @xcite ) of the base manifold @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a rw space - time satisfying the hypotheses of sect .",
    "[ sec.rw ] .",
    "let @xmath5 and let @xmath6 be the relativistic diffusion in @xmath7 starting from @xmath8 .",
    "then , almost surely as @xmath9 goes to the explosion time @xmath10 of the diffusion , the process @xmath11 converges to a random point @xmath12 of the causal boundary @xmath3 .",
    "as the geometry of the causal boundary strongly reflects the one of the base manifold , the above synthetic result actually covers a huge variety of geometric asymptotic behaviors , depending on the type of rw space - times considered , see sect .",
    "[ sec.conv ] .",
    "we also caracterize the asymptotic behavior of the tangent vector @xmath13 when @xmath9 goes to @xmath14 .",
    "we show in particular that it is strongly related to the finiteness of @xmath15 and/or to the growth rate of the torsion function @xmath16 .",
    "rougthly speaking , if @xmath17 or @xmath18 and @xmath16 grows polynomially , then when properly rescaled , the tangent process @xmath19 is convergent , whereas if @xmath18 and @xmath16 grows exponentially fast , @xmath19 shows some `` recurrence '' properties .",
    "precise statements are given in section [ sec.derivative ] below .",
    "in the case of a spatially flat robertson - walker space - time @xmath20 where @xmath16 has exponential growth , we manage to push the analysis further , see @xcite .",
    "indeed , we show that not only the process @xmath11 converges to a random point @xmath12 of the causal boundary @xmath3 but the poisson boundary of the diffusion is precisely generated by the single random variable @xmath12 , which in that case can be identified with a spacelike copy of the euclidean space @xmath21 .",
    "namely , we prove the following result :    let @xmath22 be a robertson - walker space - time where @xmath23 has exponential growth .",
    "let @xmath5 and let @xmath24 be the relativistic diffusion in @xmath25 starting from @xmath8 .",
    "then , almost surely when @xmath9 goes to infinity , the spatial projection @xmath26 converges to a random point @xmath27 in @xmath21 , and the invariant @xmath28field of the whole diffusion is generated by the single random variable @xmath27 .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly recall the geometrical background on robertson - walker space - times and the definition of the relativistic diffusion in this setting . in section [ sec.results ] , we then state the results concerning the asymptotic behavior of the relativistic diffusion .",
    "the last section is devoted to the proofs of these results . for reasons of concisions , some elements of proofs",
    "are omitted here but they appear in great detail in the author s thesis @xcite .",
    "the lorentz manifolds we consider here are robertson - walker space - times . these manifolds are named after h. p. robertson and a. g. walker @xcite and their work on solutions of einstein s equations satisfying the `` cosmological principle '' .",
    "they are the natural geometric framework to formulate the theory of big - bang in general relativity .      the constraint that a space - time satisfies both einstein s equations and the cosmological principle implies it has a warped product structure , see e.g. @xcite p. 395404 . a rw space - time , classically denoted by @xmath29 ,",
    "is thus defined as a cartesian product of an open interval @xmath30 ( the base ) and a riemannian manifold @xmath31 of constant curvature ( the fiber ) , endowed with a lorentz metric of the following form @xmath32 where @xmath23 is a positive function on @xmath33 , called the _ expansion function _ or _",

    "let us fix an integer @xmath35 .",

    "moreover , we will consider here two types of expansion functions that correspond to the two standard models in cosmology : a universe in _ infinite expansion _ or a _ big - crunch _ , see fig .",

    "@xmath18 , and @xmath44 on @xmath45 ( infinite expansion ) ; 2 .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( big - crunch ) ;    ]    in the case @xmath18 , since @xmath48 is nonnegative and nonincreasing , it admits a limit at infinity that we denote by @xmath49 .",
    "[ rem.logconcave ] the hypothesis of @xmath42concavity of the expansion function is classical . from a physical point of view",
    ", it ensures that a rw space - time satisfies the weak energy condition of @xcite .",
    "indeed , the stress - energy tensor associated to a rw space - time via einstein s equations has a perfect fluid structure with energy density @xmath50 and pressure density @xmath51 given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the curvature of the fiber @xmath54 . the classical weak energy condition @xmath55 and strong energy condition @xmath56 are thus respectively equivalent to @xmath57 in particular , a spatially flat rw space - time satisfies the weak energy condition if and only if the expansion function is log - concave .",
    "if the warping function is concave , the strong energy condition is automatically satisfied , whatever the curvature of the fiber . from a more mathematical point of view , @xmath42concavity of the expansion function allows for example to caracterize spacelike hypersurfaces with constant higher order mean curvature as the slices @xmath58 of the foliation @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "let us also note that despite we are assuming global @xmath42concavity here for simplicity , most of our results generalize if @xmath23 is @xmath42concave outside a compact set .    in the case",
    "@xmath18 , the growth rate at infinity of the warping function @xmath23 will play and important role in the sequel .    [ defi.2 ] if @xmath18 , we will say that the growth rate of the torsion function is    1 .",
