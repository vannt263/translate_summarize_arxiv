    "an optical light pulse with a well defined amplitude is represented in the quantum theory by a coherent state prepared in a certain localized mode of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "this imposes restrictions on the possibility of identifying the pulse amplitude , as coherent states are in general not orthogonal in the quantum mechanical sense and consequently can not be distinguished with certainty @xcite .",
    "the above observation suggests that the capacity of an optical communication link is fundamentally limited by the average optical power and the number of available field modes , which is indeed confirmed by a thorough analysis @xcite .",
    "the most elementary technique for reading out optical signals is direct detection based on the photoelectric effect , in which the incoming radiation generates a discrete number of counts @xcite .",
    "this process does not depend on the phase of the incident light .",
    "in many communication schemes direct detection is not optimal , and the readout can be enhanced by coherent phase - sensitive techniques , which combine the incoming signal with a strong coherent reference field and detect resulting superpositions @xcite .",
    "such a strategy can approach the quantum limit for certain encodings , but it requires phase stability between the signal and the reference @xcite .",
    "a coherent reference field is therefore an additional resource that allows one to boost the performance of optical communication .",
    "however , coherent detection becomes sensitive to imperfections that direct detection is robust against , such as the phase noise : one can envisage a realistic scenario in which the phase wanders randomly between consecutive transmissions , introducing a mismatch with the reference field .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze how phase noise affects the ultimate quantum limit on the accessible information for a class of optical communication schemes .",
    "specifically , we consider a sequence of time bins , each of them containing a coherent pulse with a fixed amplitude prepared in one of @xmath0 distinguishable modes , corresponding to @xmath0 symbols used for communication .",
    "these modes can be thought of as two orthogonal polarizations for @xmath1 , or modes with well defined orbital angular momentum in a more general case @xcite . in order to explore the intermediate regime between fully coherent detection and the completely dephased limit corresponding to direct detection",
    ", we assume that the phase between consecutive uses of the channel undergoes diffusion described by a canonical model obtained by solving the diffusion equation on a unit circle .",
    "general formulas for the transformation of the transmitted states are derived in the multimode fock basis .",
    "the accessible information is estimated with the help of the holevo bound @xcite . for a finite number of time bins we study analytically the weak amplitude limit when the dominant contribution comes from the one - photon sector .",
    "further , we carry out numerical calculations of the holevo quantity which allows us to extend the discussion to higher average photon numbers .",
    "these results lead us to a conjecture which implies a linear form of the asymptotic scaling in the weak signal limit of the accessible information with the average photon number used for communication .",
    "this is a qualitatively different behaviour compared to the fully coherent scheme , when the holevo quantity as a function of the average photon number becomes infinitely steep when the pulse amplitude tends to zero .    by way of illustration ,",
    "let us briefly discuss the two extreme cases using the simplest version of the communication scheme that will be studied here .",
    "suppose that two equiprobable symbols , corresponding to two bit values , are encoded as coherent states of equal amplitudes prepared in a single time bin , but in two orthogonal polarizations .",
    "if the two polarizations are separated at the output using a polarizing beam splitter and measured using direct detection , the bit value is missing whenever neither of the detectors produces any counts .",
    "such a communication scheme is an example of the well known binary erasure channel @xcite .",
    "the probability that one of the detectors clicks , i.e.  an erasure does not occur , is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the average number of photons in the coherent state .",
    "this figure gives directly the accessible information for the communication scheme , which for very weak signals , when @xmath4 , can be approximated as @xmath5 , scaling linearly with @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , the ultimate quantum limit for classical communication using two equiprobable quantum states depends only on the absolute value of their scalar product , which in our example is @xmath6 .",
    "the accessible information is bounded from above by the holevo quantity @xcite , given in this specific case by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 stands for binary entropy .",
    "this value can be viewed as the maximum accessible information of the communication scheme achievable by implementing collective detection and exploiting phase coherence between consecutive transmissions .",
    "for @xmath4 the accessible information scales as @xmath9 in the leading order . consequently ,",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : dif ] the accesible information becomes infinitely steep when @xmath3 approaches zero , demonstrating the dramatic difference between coherent and incoherent detection . results presented in this work indicate that for an arbitrarily small amount of phase diffusion this feature is lost and the accessible information scales linearly with @xmath3 , albeit it becomes enhanced by a multiplicative factor that diverges to infinity when diffusion becomes negligible .",
    "although this conclusion relies on a numerically motivated conjecture , we have been able to derive an analytical expression for the multiplicative enhancement factor using the szeg limit theorem @xcite .",
    "[ fig : dif ]     the motivation for the model studied in this paper is two - fold . on the practical side ,",
    "the idea of sending a light pulse in one of @xmath0 distinguishable modes underlies the pulse position modulation ( ppm ) format , in which the modes form a temporal train .",
    "for very low average photon numbers , the ppm encoding approaches the optimal capacity of a bosonic channel and is currently studied in the context of deep - space communication @xcite .",
    "our model can be viewed as a study of dephasing in ppm keying when the phase diffusion occurs only between the consecutive @xmath0-ary ppm symbols .",
    "this assumption is justified when the temporal separation between the symbols is much larger then the overall duration of individual symbols . from the formal perspective",
    ", the property of the fixed average photon number per symbol simplifies the mathematical treatment of the model : for a random overall phase , one can analyze separately contributions to the holevo quantity from individual subspaces with a well - defined total photon number .",

    "transmission of information encoded in a sequence of light pulses with the phase subjected to diffusion can be formally represented as a quantum memory channel @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the phase plays the role of a classical memory system that undergoes fluctuations between channel uses and is not affected by channel inputs",
    ". we will be interested in a scenario when the initial phase preparation is completely random and neither the initial nor the final value of the phase is available to the communicating parties . in order to analyse the accessible information we will consider communication using blocks of input systems of length @xmath10 . the ultimate quantum bound will be given by the holevo quantity in the limit of the block size going to infinity .",
    "specifically , the memory effects will be included by taking as the physical system a block of @xmath10 time bins , each comprising @xmath0 orthogonal modes of the electromagnetic radiation , distinguishable for example by their polarization and/or orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the annihilation operator for the @xmath12th mode in the @xmath13th bin , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the orthogonality implies that @xmath16 = \\delta_{ll ' } \\delta_{mm'}$ ] . a single word to be encoded in the block of time bins",
    "can be represented as an @xmath10-element sequence @xmath17 , where each @xmath18 , assuming one of @xmath0 values , specifies the symbol transmitted in the @xmath13th bin .",
    "this word is encoded as the input state @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the vacuum state of the electromagnetic field and @xmath21 is the amplitude of a coherent pulse in an individual time bin , assumed for simplicity to be real .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath22 can be viewed as a coherent state with an amplitude @xmath23 prepared in a delocalized mode characterized by a bosonic operator @xmath24 which satisfies @xmath25 = 1 $ ] .",
    "we will find this representation helpful when analyzing the fock state representation of the input states .",
    "it will be convenient to write the state @xmath22 as a superposition @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the average photon number in an individual time bin , @xmath28 denotes the poisson distribution with the mean value @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the normalized @xmath31-photon component , which can be defined in a compact way as @xmath32 the states @xmath22 undergo dephasing described by a completely positive trace - preserving map @xmath33 whose explicit form will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : dephasing ] .",
    "the strength of the dephasing introduced by @xmath33 will be characterized by a real parameter @xmath34 , to be defined later . for the time being , the only property required from @xmath33 is that it preserves the total photon number @xmath31 while removing completely coherence between subspaces with different @xmath31 .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath35    it is assumed that all input states are sent with the same probability @xmath36",
    ". we will be interested in the holevo quantity @xmath37 calculated for a block of @xmath10 symbols and the dephasing strength @xmath34 , which can be viewed as a bound on the accessible information when the phase is completely randomized after every @xmath10 uses of the channel .",
    "explicitly , the holevo quantity is given by the difference @xmath38 between the von neumann entropy @xmath39 of the averaged state @xmath40 subjected to @xmath33 and the average entropy of the individual states @xmath41 .",
    "because the states @xmath42 appearing on the right hand side of ( [ eq : lambda|m > ] ) occupy orthogonal subspaces corresponding to different eigenvalues of the total photon number operator @xmath43 , the von neumann entropy of a state @xmath41 can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the shannon entropy of a classical probability distribution .",
    "analogously , the von neumann entropy of the average state after dephasing @xmath46 reads @xmath47 where the normalized average density matrix in the @xmath31-photon sector is given by @xmath48 consequently , the holevo bound for our communication scheme can be written as a weighted sum of contributions from @xmath31-photon sectors : @xmath49 where @xmath50 let us note that @xmath51 are functions of the word length @xmath10 and depend on the specifics of the dephasing process , but they are independent of the average photon number per time bin @xmath3 .",
    "this is because each symbol is encoded in a coherent pulse with the same amplitude .",
    "the above feature greatly simplifies the analysis of the holevo quantity .",
    "let us now specify details of the dephasing map .",
    "we assume that the phases in individual bins are shifted by respective random variables @xmath52 taken from the range @xmath53 .",
    "the phase @xmath54 in the first time bin is completely randomized , while the phase @xmath55 for the bin @xmath56 is given by a conditional probability distribution @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a solution of the diffusion equation on the group u(1 ) with the initial condition in the form of the dirac delta function @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 , playing the role of time in the diffusion equation , defines here the diffusion strength .",
    "the characteristic coherence time of our channel , expressed in the number of time bins , is given by @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath61 we recover perfectly correlated phases as then @xmath62 approaches the dirac delta @xmath59 , while in the limit @xmath63 we obtain a uniform flat distribution @xmath64 which corresponds to complete dephasing .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath62 reads @xmath65 this expression will be useful when calculating the transformation of the input states in the fock basis .",
    "the map @xmath33 describing dephasing of the input state for all @xmath10 time bins can be written explicitly as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the operator of the total photon number in the @xmath13th time bin . changing integration variables to @xmath68 , @xmath69 ,",
    "enables one to represent @xmath33 as a composition of commuting maps @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "if the input state is represented as a density matrix in the fock states basis for the set of modes @xmath11 , then the action of @xmath33 results simply in multiplying off - diagonal elements by certain coefficients .",
    "the explicit form of these coefficients can be found as follows .",
    "let @xmath74 and @xmath75 be two states such that the number of photons in each time bin is fixed : @xmath76 it will be convenient to denote sequences of photon numbers in individual time bins as @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "obviously , averaging with respect to the overall phase defined in ( [ eq : lambda1 ] ) implies that @xmath79 is non - zero only if the total photon numbers in both the states are identical , @xmath80 .",
    "we will restrict our attention to this case for the remainder of the present section",
    ". then the fourier transform given in ( [ eq : ftdiffusion ] ) yields : @xmath81{{|\\phi\\rangle_{}}}{{}_{}\\langle \\phi'|}.\\ ] ] consequently , for the composition of all @xmath10 maps @xmath70 we have @xmath82 where the dephasing factor @xmath83 appearing in the exponent can be written as @xmath84 in the second equality we applied to one of the two identical sums over @xmath85 in the squared large round bracket the fact that @xmath86 .",
    "a simple counting how many times a product @xmath87 for a given pair of indices @xmath88 and @xmath85 appears in the above sums yields the expression @xmath89 it is seen that the contributions to the dephasing factor grow linearly with the distance between the time bins .",
    "this reflects the fact that a convolution of conditional probability distributions defined in ( [ eq : condprobdist ] ) has also the form of ( [ eq : pdiff ] ) with the parameter @xmath34 multiplied by an integer specifying the distance between the time bins .",
    "obviously , the zero - photon sector contribution @xmath90 to the holevo quantity in ( [ eq : holevo = sum ] ) is identically equal to zero .",
    "therefore for very weak signals , when @xmath91 , i.e.  the average number of photons in the sequence of @xmath10 time bins is much less than one , the poisson distribution @xmath92 in ( [ eq : holevo = sum ] ) assigns the largest weight to the one - photon contribution @xmath93 . because the contribution to the holevo quantity from any @xmath31-photon sector can not exceed @xmath94 which corresponds to perfect decoding of the symbols",
    ", we expect that for sufficiently weak signals the holevo quantity will be well approximated by @xmath95 in this section we will analyze in detail the structure of input states in the one - photon sector in order to find a closed expression for @xmath96",
    ".    it will be convenient to introduce in the one - photon sector of the hilbert space a formal decomposition into the time bin subsystem @xmath97 spanned by @xmath10 states @xmath98 and the symbol subsystem @xmath99 spanned by @xmath0 states @xmath100 such that @xmath101 the normalized density matrix for an individual input state in the one - photon sector can be written as @xmath102 which after dephasing is transformed into @xmath103 it is straightforward to notice that the entropy of this state is equal to the entropy of a density matrix for the subsystem @xmath97 alone obtained by replacing @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "the latter can be in turn written as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is an example of a so - called toeplitz matrix @xcite , for which elements depend only on the difference of the indices @xmath108 .",
    "the von neumann entropy @xmath109 has the same value for any word @xmath110 .",
    "let us now inspect the average input density matrix @xmath111 in the one - photon sector , which using ( [ eq : psi(1)mdecomp ] ) can be written as : @xmath112 the average of the rank one operator @xmath113 over all words @xmath110 depends on whether the indices @xmath13 and @xmath114 are equal or different . if @xmath115 , the average is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the identity operator in the subspace @xmath99 , while for @xmath118 the average reads @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is an equally weighted superposition of all symbol states .",
    "therefore , the one - photon sector of the averaged input state can be written as @xmath121\\ ] ] as a result , the average state at the output reads @xmath122 where @xmath123 has been defined in ( [ eq : tdef ] ) and @xmath124 is the identity operator for the time bin subsystem @xmath97 .",
    "the two terms in the above equation contain orthogonal projectors @xmath125 and @xmath126 in the symbol subspace @xmath99 .",
    "consequently , the von neumann entropy @xmath127 can be simplified to the form @xmath128 this yields @xmath129 \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : x1sumh(t_i ) } &   = & \\log_2 m + \\frac{m-1}{lm } \\sum_{i=1}^{l } h(t_i),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath123 .",
    "we will analyze this expression , including the asymptotic limit @xmath132 , in the next section .",
    "although the assumption @xmath91 made in ( [ eq : xonephotonapprox ] ) requires @xmath10 to be finite , let us inspect the asymptotic limit of ( [ eq : x1sumh(t_i ) ] ) when @xmath132 .",
    "we will find a closed analytic expression in this limit and show that it approximates with good accuracy the value of @xmath96 even for finite word lenghts @xmath10 provided that dephasing is sufficiently strong .",
    "the crucial feature of the derived expression for @xmath96 that enables further simplification is that @xmath131 are eigenvalues of a toeplitz matrix whose elements depend only on the distance from the diagonal , @xmath133 . for this class of matrices we can use the szeg theorem @xcite , which states that if the series @xmath134 remains finite with the increasing matrix size when @xmath135 , then in this limit the average of the values of any continuous function @xmath136 on the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath123 approaches an asymptotic value given by an integral @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the inverse fourier transform of the coefficients @xmath139 .",
    "szeg theorem holds for any toeplitz matrix as long as the sum of absolute values @xmath140 is finite . in our case @xmath141 and the above series is convergent for any @xmath142 .",
    "it is also straightforward to calculate a closed expression for @xmath143 : @xmath144 further , we show in [ sec : appa ] that the integral on the right hand side of ( [ eq : integral ] ) with the function @xmath143 given by ( [ eq : f(theta ) ] ) can be evaluated analytically .",
    "this yields finally the following asymptotic expression for the holevo quantity in the one - photon sector : @xmath145 in figure [ fig : chi1 ] we depict @xmath146 given by ( [ eq : chi1 ] ) as a function of @xmath34 for several numbers @xmath0 of symbols used for communication .",
    "when @xmath63 , i.e.  coherence between consecutive bins is erased , the proportionality factor approaches the value @xmath147 .",
    "this factor , multiplied by the average photon number @xmath3 gives the standard expression for the capacity of an @xmath0-ary erasure channel in the regime of high erasure probability .",
    "for finite @xmath34 the proportionality factor increases , as the coherence that survives dephasing allows one to boost the channel capacity . in the same graph",
    ", we also show @xmath96 calculated for finite numbers of time bins , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath96 deviates from @xmath150 towards lower values for small @xmath34 , as restricting the length of the time bin sequence prevents one from exploiting fully the state coherence at the detection stage .    in order to gain insight into the validity of the limiting expression @xmath146 obtained from szeg theorem , in figure [ fig : chi1contour ] we present a contour plot of @xmath96 calculated according to ( [ eq : x1sumh(t_i ) ] ) as a function of the number of bins @xmath10 and the channel coherence time @xmath60 .",
    "the graph indicates that the limiting value offers a good approximation in the region when @xmath151 .",
    "let us recall that truncating the holevo quantity to the one - photon sector is valid when @xmath152 .",
    "combining these two inequalities gives a condition @xmath153 , i.e.  the average number of photons transmitted over the coherence time of the channel needs to be much smaller than one for the limiting value @xmath150 to be reached .",
    "finally , let us point out that the expression given in ( [ eq : chi1 ] ) diverges as @xmath61 .",
    "this is easily understood , as for finite @xmath10 and @xmath154 the matrix @xmath123 has only one non - zero eigenvalue equal to @xmath10 which gives @xmath155 at the same time , the off - diagonal elements of the toeplitz matrix @xmath123 are all equal to one , @xmath156 , and the assumptions of the szeg theorem are not satisfied .",
    "in order to go beyond the one - photon approximation and find contributions to the holevo quantity defined in ( [ eq : xndef ] ) from sectors containing @xmath157 photons we need to resort to numerical calculations .",
    "we used the following computational approach to obtain numerical results .",
    "the first observation is that for a fixed photon number @xmath31 the entropies of individual states @xmath158 are all equal for any word @xmath110 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to consider a single word @xmath110 in order to calculate the second term in ( [ eq : xndef ] ) . starting from the definition given in ( [ eq : psimn ] ) and using multinomial expansion of the @xmath31th power @xmath159 of the respective creation operator",
    "the input state @xmath160 can be written as @xmath161 here the summation is carried out over all sequences of nonnegative integers @xmath162 satisfying the constraint @xmath163 .",
    "it will be helpful to denote multimode fock states present in the superposition as @xmath164 the density matrix of the output state written in the fock basis @xmath165 has elements given by @xmath166 where @xmath167 are given by ( [ eq : lambda = sumfinal ] ) . in order to estimate the computational complexity of the eigenproblem that needs to be solved to calculate the von neumann entropy @xmath168 ,",
    "let us find the number of vectors @xmath169 for a given total number of photons @xmath31 and a fixed word @xmath110 .",
    "for this purpose we need to calculate in how many distinguishable ways @xmath31 photons can be distributed among @xmath10 time bins .",
    "a number @xmath31 can be written as a composition ( i.e.  an ordered partition ) of @xmath170 greater than zero integers in @xmath171 ways .",
    "time bins for these integers can be chosen in @xmath172 ways .",
    "this gives altogether @xmath173 distinguishable states .",
    "let us now consider the density matrix of the average output state .",
    "it is given explicitly by @xmath174 here the first sum is over sequences @xmath175 and @xmath176 satisfying the constraint @xmath177 , while the second sum is carried out over all @xmath178 words @xmath110 . here attention needs to be paid to the number of distinguishable states @xmath169 for a given sequence @xmath175 .",
    "of course , if two words @xmath110 and @xmath179 differ only for time bins in which no photons are present , i.e.  @xmath180 occurs only for @xmath13 such that @xmath181 , then the kets @xmath169 and @xmath182 correspond to the same physical state according to the definition in ( [ eq : ketnmdef ] ) .",
    "therefore for a fixed @xmath175 we will have only @xmath183 distinguishable states , where @xmath184 is the number of non - zero entries in the sequence @xmath175 . we will label these distinguishable states as @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is a sequence of length @xmath184 specifying symbols only for time bins occupied by at least one photon .    in order to avoid the superfluous degeneracy associated with states @xmath169",
    "we will write the average output state @xmath187 in the basis states @xmath185 : @xmath188 and give formulas for the coefficients @xmath189 .",
    "if @xmath190 , ( [ eq : varrhonav = nm ] ) implies that only elements with @xmath191 are nonzero .",
    "a given @xmath192 is realized by @xmath193 terms in the sum over @xmath110 in ( [ eq : varrhonav = nm ] ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath194 let us now consider the density matrix elements when @xmath195 . if the symbols specified by @xmath192 and @xmath196 differ at ( at least one ) time bin for which both states @xmath185 and @xmath197 contain nonzero photons , then @xmath198 as the corresponding term of the form @xmath199 never appears in the sum over @xmath110 given in ( [ eq : varrhonav = nm ] ) .",
    "if the symbols are identical at all the time bins that contain non - zero photons for both @xmath175 and @xmath176 , we need to count how many times this instance would occur in the summation over @xmath110 in ( [ eq : varrhonav = nm ] ) . because symbols are fixed in time bins for which either @xmath175 or @xmath176 give a non - zero photon number , we are free only to choose symbols in time bins in which both @xmath175 and @xmath176 are zero .",
    "the number of these time bins is equal to @xmath200 .",
    "consequently , the corresponding density matrix element is given by @xmath201    the number of distinguishable states @xmath185 spanning the average output state can be calculated similarly as before for an individual output state , but in the current case we need to take into account all possible combinations of symbols for a given distribution of photons between time bins .",
    "when @xmath31 is represented as a composition of @xmath170 integers greater than zero , we will now have @xmath202 states distinguishable by chosen symbols .",
    "consequently , the total number of states that need to be taken into account is @xmath203 .",
    "this effectively limits the number of time bins and photons that can be taken into account in numerical calculations . as an example , for binary encoding @xmath1 and @xmath204 time bins the dimension of the relevant hilbert space is 952 for @xmath205 and 1408 for @xmath206 .",
    "using the numerical approach presented in the preceding section , we calculated contributions to holevo quantity for sequences of @xmath204 and @xmath207 bins containing up to @xmath205 and @xmath208 photons , respectively , assuming binary encoding , @xmath1 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : chin ] .",
    "for all numerical examples we found that the contribution from the @xmath31-photon sector is bounded from above by @xmath209 additionally , we have also verified numerically this inequality for longer sequences , up to @xmath210 in the two - photon sector and up to @xmath211 in the three - photon sector .",
    "assuming that the inequality ( [ eq : xn<=nx1 ] ) holds in a general case would allow us to obtain the following bound on the holevo quantity : @xmath212 this in turn would give a universal bound on the accessible information per channel use in the form @xmath213 valid for an arbitrary photon number @xmath3 .",
    "it is seen that the asymptotic value of the holevo quantity in the one - photon sector plays the role of the proportionality factor between the accessible information and the average photon number per time bin .",
    "this factor , depicted in figure [ fig : chi1 ] , specifies the enhancement that can be gained from partial coherence between time bins that remains after dephasing .",
    "its divergence in the limit @xmath61 indicates the qualitative change of scaling from the linear one , as discussed in the introduction .    in figure [",
    "fig : total ] we plot the accessible information as a function of the average photon number @xmath3 calculated using the numerical values of contributions @xmath214 . in the graphs , we chose the range of @xmath3 such that the poisson distribution @xmath92 truncated at the highest photon number @xmath31 included in the calculations yields at least @xmath215 of the actual mean value @xmath216 .",
    "the results are compared with the conjectured linear bound @xmath217 . while for strong dephasing the linear bound matches the numerical results in the limit @xmath218 , for weak dephasing the bound becomes less tight .",
    "the principal reason for this change is that the coherence time of the channel is longer than the bin sequence included in numerical calculations .",
    "we will close the paper by discussing one physically motivated attempt to prove inequality ( [ eq : xn<=nx1 ] ) that illustrates certain mathematical subtleties of the communication scheme considered here .",
    "the basic idea is to apply a photon number splitting procedure analogous to eavesdropping in quantum key distribution with faint laser pulses @xcite to split deterministically @xmath31 photons prepared in the state @xmath30 into @xmath31 separate paths , each containing exactly one photon .",
    "this realizes a transformation @xmath219 i.e.  individual photons are described by the same state @xmath220 and the overall state is given by its @xmath31-fold tensor product",
    ". the photon splitting procedure can be in principle reversed using a suitably chosen unitary transformation @xcite , therefore communication using the ensemble of states @xmath221 should be equivalent to that using states @xmath222 , where @xmath223 . in the absence of dephasing , the entropy of the average state can be estimated as @xmath224 which follows immediately from the subadditivity of von neumann entropy , while for an individual state we have @xmath225 as individual states are completely uncorrelated .",
    "these two identities combined together give the sought bound @xmath226",
    "= n { \\cal x}^{(1 ) } \\label{eq : ineqindependentdephasing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the fully coherent case .",
    "however , the above argument no longer works in the presence of dephasing .",
    "the reason is that dephasing applied to the state @xmath30 introduces phase correlations between photons after splitting them into separate paths and their joint state can not be represented as a tensor product of identical individual states . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath227 and @xmath228 photons in two time bins .",
    "let the word @xmath110 be fixed , which allows us to consider only one field mode per time bin .",
    "the single - photon sector state after dephasing written in the fock basis @xmath229 takes the form @xmath230 two independently dephased single photons are described in the product fock state basis by the joint state : @xmath231 on the other hand , consider the input state in the two - photon sector @xmath232 when the two photons are subjected to dephasing and split into separate paths according to a map @xmath233 their final state written in the same basis as in ( [ eq : onetimesone ] ) takes the form @xmath234 this expression is clearly different from ( [ eq : onetimesone ] ) , although tracing over one of the two photons does reproduce the dephased single photon state from ( [ eq : onephotondephased ] ) . while the inequality ( [ eq : ineqindependentdephasing ] ) holds also for states @xmath235 , the above example shows that unfortunately in the general case the dephased multiphoton states @xmath236 are not mapped by the beam splitting procedure onto @xmath31-fold tensor products @xmath237^{\\otimes n}$ ] .",
    "the difference between independent and collective dephasing for photons split into separate paths has consequences for the holevo quantity . in figure",
    "[ fig : holentr ] we plot as a function of @xmath34 entropies of individual and average states in the two - photon sector as well as contributions to the holevo quantities @xmath238 given by the difference between these two , assuming either the actual photon pairs subjected to collective dephasing or two independently dephased single photons .",
    "the case of binary coding @xmath1 and sequences of either @xmath239 or @xmath207 time bins is shown in the graphs . in these plots , the holevo quantity for collective dephasing turns out to be slightly smaller than its counterpart for individual dephasing .",
    "if this observation was a universal feature , it would pave the way to prove the inequality conjectured in ( [ eq : xn<=nx1 ] ) in the general case using ( [ eq : ineqindependentdephasing ] ) .",
    "however , its validity seems to depend heavily on the specifics of the input states and the noise model considered in this work rather than to follow from general properties of noisy quantum channels .",
    "we have analysed the accessible information of an optical communication scheme based on sending a sequence of symbols encoded as coherent states of orthogonal field modes .",
    "we implemented a numerical procedure to compute the holevo quantity and analysed analytically the weak pulse limit , when the number of photons in a time bin sequence is much less than one .",
    "the obtained results suggest a general fact that if consecutive transmissions experience dephasing , the holevo quantity scales linearly with the average photon number in the limit of very weak pulses .",
    "this is a qualitative departure from the fully coherent scheme , where the holevo quantity becomes enhanced by a logarithmic factor .",
    "nevertheless , even partial preservation of the relative phase can improve the communication capacity compared to incoherent direct detection by increasing the multiplicative factor that relates the average photon number to the accessible information .",
    "this conclusion resembles the results obtained recently in quantum metrology @xcite , where in many scenarios even arbitrarily weak decoherence changes dependence of the measurement precision on the number of probes used from the heisenberg scaling to the shot - noise scaling , albeit the latter can be improved by a multiplicative factor if the probes are prepared and measured collectively .",
    "the current work leads to questions about the practical attainability of the holevo limit for communication over realistic channels with phase noise .",
    "this includes design of receivers , efficient schemes for calibrating the phase reference , and the sensitivity of optimal strategies to the specific form of dephasing and other noise mechanisms occurring in realistic scenarios .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of classical communication over correlated noise channels @xcite optimization over input states is not attempted here , limiting attention to coherent states that can be prepared using standard techniques . however , even in such restricted settings , construction of receivers approaching the quantum limit remains a subject of ongoing research @xcite .",
    "this research was supported by the foundation for polish science team project cofinanced by the eu european regional development fund and the era - net chist - era project quasar .      in order to evaluate @xmath96",
    "given in ( [ eq : x1sumh(t_i ) ] ) in the asymptotic @xmath132 we need to calculate the integral @xmath240 with @xmath143 defined in ( [ eq : f(theta ) ] ) .",
    "it will be convenient to decompose @xmath241 , where the integral @xmath242 can be evaluated by elementary means , while the integral @xmath243 can be transformed by substituting @xmath244 to the form @xmath245 we will now use expansion into chebyshev polynomials of the first kind @xmath246 and the second kind @xmath247 : @xmath248 inserting these expansions into the integral over @xmath249 and making use of the properties of chebyshev polynomials @xcite gives : @xmath250}{\\sin\\theta}+\\frac{\\sin[(m - n+1)\\theta]}{\\sin\\theta}\\right)\\frac{t^{n+m}}{n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but @xmath251 when @xmath252 is odd , otherwise the integral is equal to @xmath253 . by changing summation variables to @xmath254 and @xmath255 we obtain @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the @xmath170th harmonic number defined as @xmath258 .",
