    "some of the suspected resonant pairs may not be confirmed eventually ( see , e.g. , @xcite for 55 cancri ) . on the other hand , the number of resonant pairs that remain undetected could be quite large , because the radial velocity variation due to two planets in resonance ( in particular , 2:1 ) could be indistinguishable from that due to a single planet for certain planetary mass ratio and orbital eccentricities , given the precision levels of the existing radial velocity surveys @xcite .",

    "the critical value of @xmath51 is @xmath185 for @xmath186 , @xmath187 for @xmath188@xmath74 , and @xmath189 for @xmath190 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : edampsummary ] ) .    for faster migration rate , the effects of eccentricity damping on the evolution of the system can be more complicated .",
    "for example , the calculation shown in figure [ fig : edampmed ] is similar to that in figure [ fig : inclinedmed ] ( @xmath27 and @xmath88 ) but with @xmath191 . in this case , the eccentricity damping results in clear libration of the inclination resonance variables @xmath138 after the rapid inclination excitation phase .",
    "nevertheless , the critical value of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath19 shown in figure [ fig : edampsummary ] also summarizes the results for migration rate up to @xmath192 , if it is interpreted as the critical value for inclination excitation , which may or may not be followed by a phase with @xmath138 clearly in resonance . for @xmath193 ( the maximum migration rate studied ) , the critical value of @xmath51 is modified at large @xmath19 , with none of the calculations with @xmath194 showing inclination excitation .",
    "we have investigated the effects of different migration rates on the capture into and evolution in eccentricity and inclination resonances at the 2:1 mean - motion commensurability by the convergent migration of two planets .",
    "we focused on systems with orbits that are initially slightly inclined with respect to each other .",
    "the system is first captured into the sequence i of 2:1 eccentricity resonances found by @xcite , the same as in the case of exactly coplanar orbits .",
    "if the migration rate is fast and @xmath30 , the subsequent evolution is also identical to the coplanar case , with the eccentricity resonances entering a new family ( sequence iv ) , and there is no inclination excitation or capture into inclination resonances .",
    "the new family of 2:1 eccentricity resonances ( with @xmath124@xmath1 , asymmetric librations , and orbits that intersect if they are exactly coplanar ) exists for @xmath53 , but it is possible to evolve into this family by fast migration only for @xmath30 . if the migration rate is slow , the system subsequently enters a phase with the 4:2 inclination resonance variables @xmath138 changing slowly and the inclinations increasing rapidly , before it is captured into 4:2 inclination resonances .",
    "the inclination resonance configuration is symmetric , with @xmath195 , if @xmath177 and asymmetric if @xmath181 . for intermediate migration rate ( and fast migration rate",
    "if @xmath196 ) , there is typically a rapid inclination excitation phase , but not a phase with @xmath138 clearly in resonance .",
    "we have also studied the effects of different eccentricity damping rates during migration and found that the maximum value of latexmath:[$k =    may or may not be followed by a phase with @xmath138 clearly in resonance if the migration rate is not slow ) ranges from @xmath189 for @xmath190 to @xmath187 for @xmath198 . since the evolution is sensitive to the rates of migration and eccentricity damping within the ranges expected for type ii migration due to planet - disk interaction , the discovery of extrasolar planetary systems with certain combinations of mass ratio and 2:1 resonance geometry would place a constraint on the strength of eccentricity damping during migration , as well as on the rate of migration itself .",
    "there are several effects of disk - planet interaction that were neglected in our analysis and may require further investigations .",
    "we have focused on inward migration and eccentricity damping of the outer planet , because previous hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) have shown that the disk inside the inner planet s orbit , not just the disk material between the planets , should be cleared rapidly .",
    "however , @xcite have recently shown that a better numerical treatment of the inner disk may result in a slower depletion of the inner disk and that the eccentricity damping from the inner disk could be important in explaining the observed eccentricities of resonant pairs such as that in the gj 876 system .",
    "on the other hand , when the nearby disk mass is comparable to the planet mass ( i.e. , in older , partially depleted disks ) , planets will undergo type ii migration at significantly less than the disk s viscous advection speed @xcite , so that the inner disk `` outruns '' the planet and eventually leaves an inner hole , no matter how small the inner boundary radius .",
    "the simulations of @xcite suggest the majority of planets form late enough in their parent disk s lifetime that such holes are ubiquitous .",
    "planet - disk interaction can also affect the orbital inclination of a planet .",
    "the net effect of inclination damping by secular interactions and excitation by interactions at mean - motion resonances depends on the disk parameters , but any net damping should be on a timescale comparable to or longer than the migration timescale ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is likely too slow to affect the rapid inclination excitation phase , but may result in equilibrium inclinations if the system is subsequently captured into inclination resonances and the inclinations are excited slowly by continued migration .    we have also neglected the secular apsidal and nodal precessions induced by the disk , which could change the sequence of resonance capture by changing and splitting the locations of the various resonances at the same mean - motion commensurability .",
    "@xcite have performed coplanar three - body integrations of the gj 876 resonant pair with additional apsidal precession and found that the eccentricity resonances @xmath13 and @xmath14 are captured into libration in a sequence that differs little in order or timing from the case without additional apsidal precession .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the 2:1 eccentricity resonances are first order , which means that the resonance - induced retrograde apsidal precession is proportional to @xmath199 and much larger in magnitude than the disk - induced prograde precession for small @xmath85 . on the other hand ,",
    "disk - induced nodal precession could have a larger effect , because the 4:2 inclination resonances are second order and the resonance - induced nodal precession is roughly constant for small @xmath137 .",
    "@xcite have performed some non - coplanar calculations with additional apsidal and nodal precessions and did not find any significant difference from the calculations without additional precessions .",
    "although the adopted disk surface density is 5 times that of the minimum mass solar nebula , they assumed an outer disk with an inner edge that is likely too far ( 20 hill radii ) from the outer planet s orbit , and the amount of precession induced by the disk is determined primarily by the material closest to the planet .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have recently examined the effects of turbulence in circumstellar gas disks on mean - motion resonances in extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "they have found that stochastic perturbations due to turbulence could prevent planets from staying in resonant configurations and that planetary systems with mean - motion resonances should be rare .",
    "this appears to be inconsistent with the observational evidence discussed in  [ intro ] .",
    "one possible explanation is that these studies assumed full magnetorotational turbulence , whereas circumstellar disk models usually exhibit an extensive dead zone around the midplane , where the ionization fraction is low and the disk is magnetorotationally stable due to ohmic dissipation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for weak turbulence",
    ", the turbulence may generate larger libration amplitudes than in smooth migration and allow , e.g. , the jump from sequence i to sequence iv to occur at a slower migration rate .",
    "finally , a better understanding of the capture into the inclination resonances is needed .",
    "since the time spent in the phase with @xmath138 changing slowly and @xmath137 increasing rapidly is nearly independent of the migration rate for slow migration ( see  [ noncoplanar ] ) , in the limit of very slow migration , there is an almost instantaneous jump in the inclinations at the time of the inclination resonance capture , if we measure time in units of the migration timescale .",
    "this is not what one would expect if the capture into the inclination resonances can be modeled by the appearance of additional equilibrium points and separatrices in the hamiltonian theory of a single second - order resonance ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian approach is based on the assumption that each resonance is encountered individually , which is clearly not the case in our problem . in particular , the system is already in eccentricity resonances when it enters the inclination resonances .",
    "if the system is captured into just an inclination resonance , the capture requires @xmath200 . on the other hand , if the system is already in eccentricity resonances so that @xmath201 , then the capture into the inclination resonances requires @xmath202 .",
