    "as pulsars age , they lose their spin - down energy through both radiation and relativistic particle ejection .",
    "one may approximate the particle ejection in two forms : anisotropic winds from the pulsar surface and bi - polar jets .",
    "previous x - ray studies have shown the wind component to be primarily equatorial and axisymmetric , producing observed tori in pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , whereas the jet outflows are only observed in a few , though well studied , young pulsars ( e.g. the crab and vela pulsars , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "only a few nearby and relatively old pulsars have been shown to have their pwne , mostly enhanced by ram - pressure confinement ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for a pwn or similar pulsar ejection feature to be observed in x - rays , the synchrotron - emitting particles must have energies on order of 10@xmath2 tev , achievable in shocks of the pulsar ejecta as it encounters the local interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "x - ray investigations of pulsar outflows are therefore crucial in understanding their origin and particle acceleration , which can in turn provide insight into the origin of other , more exotic and distant , outflows ( e.g. from active galactic nuclei ) .",
    "a particularly striking case is that of the pulsar b2224 + 65 and its x - ray - emitting `` jet '' .",
    "b2224 + 65 is one of the fastest pulsars known with a radio proper motion of @xmath3 mas yr@xmath1 @xcite ; corresponding to a transverse velocity of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance to b2224 + 65 in units of kpc and is uncertain in the range of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the rapid motion of the pulsar produces a bow shock nebula visible in h@xmath7 @xcite which has been dubbed the `` guitar nebula '' due to its peculiar morphology . aside from its high proper motion ,",
    "b2224 + 65 behaves like a normal radio pulsar , with a modest energy spin - down rate of @xmath8 and period @xmath9 s. x - ray studies of b2224 + 65 do not reveal significant emission concurrent with the h@xmath7 ( however , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but rather an unusual extended linear feature apparently stemming from b2224 + 65 and offset from the pulsar s direction of motion by @xmath0118@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the feature , extending @xmath02@xmath11 away from the pulsar , was found to have an apparent non - thermal spectrum though the details as to its origin have thus far remained a mystery .",
    "such a distinct , linear x - ray emitting feature has not been identified anywhere else in the galaxy with the possible exception of the galactic center ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it was suggested by @xcite that the extended feature may not be associated with b2224 + 65 but rather with a nearby point source , although no physical production scenario was developed for the feature . through theoretical modeling of the linear x - ray emission by @xcite ,",
    "it was proposed that the feature could be produced through highly energetic particles that are accelerated at , and subsequently escape , the pulsar wind terminal shock but are ultimately confined by a large - scale , organized interstellar magnetic field . however , there are a number of observational requirements to the @xcite model that have yet to be fulfilled , primarily a proper motion of the feature consistent with b2224 + 65 .",

    ", we assume the case of no bending for simplicity .",
    "the presence of any bending will serve primarily to dilute the significance of any determined edge location along the minor axis and will be propagated through our analysis as a systematic uncertainty .    for our morphological analysis of the jet , particularly for studying its proper motion and the significance of the extended emission regions , we construct surface brightness profiles along its major and minor axes .",

    "4a , there is evidence for a weak counter feature , opposite in direction to the primary jet - like feature .",
    "this counter feature , extending @xmath020@xmath18 away from b2224 + 65 , is considerably fainter than the main jet - like feature though it still appears significant compared to the local x - ray background . due to the faintness of the counter feature , the counting statistics are too low in individual epoch observations for a positive detection .",
    "we therefore use the merged epoch event file , along with a small 20@xmath3520 arcsec@xmath2 box centered on the feature in question , to derive a background subtracted count rate of @xmath38 .",
    "comparatively , the local background corresponding to the same region has a count rate of 0.68@xmath160.09@xmath39 , placing the counter feature at 4 times the background uncertainty or at a detection significance of @xmath04@xmath15 .",
    "it is therefore highly unlikely that this feature results from poisson variations in the x - ray background .        in fig .",
    "4b , there appears to be a slight shift in the sharp left edge as well as an extension far to the right when comparing the minor axis surface brightness profiles in the first and second epochs .",
    "currently , we concern ourselves with the presence of the apparent shift which , if confirmed , may be compared to the observed proper motion of b2224 + 65 , establishing a connection between the pulsar and jet - like feature . in order to determine the shift between epochs",
    ", we apply a simple one dimensional edge detection method to the sharp edges in the two epoch data .",
    "our edge detection method involves constructing finely binned intensity profiles taken from high resolution count maps ( with @xmath00.12@xmath18 pixels ) and convolving the profiles with a filter based on the work of @xcite , which can be approximated by @xmath40e@xmath41 , with a filter scale of @xmath42=0.5 , comparable to the acis resolution . to determine the underlying distribution of edge positions in the two epoch data , and",
    "thus derive uncertainty estimates , we generate 5000 poisson realizations of the high resolution count profiles and convolve each with the chosen filter , following the method of bootstrap resampling . by filter design , the edge position for each realization",
    "is determined by `` centroiding '' the peak in the surface brightness profile and therefore depends primarily on the counting statistics of the available data .",
    "the derived positions are thus insensitive to the exact choice of the filter scale or binning of the count profiles ; we have verified this using a variety of profile binning and filter scales , all of which produce results consistent with those presented here .",
    "based on the histogram distributions of the resampling ( fig .",
    "5 ) , we find a shift between the two epochs of 0.62@xmath43 arcsec , with 90 percent confidence intervals .",
    "the reported errors on the shift are likely underestimates of the true uncertainty as they do not account for errors in our astrometric corrections , though they do include any possible systematic uncertainty from unresolved bending in the jet .",
    "nevertheless , the shift , especially its direction , is consistent with the proper motion of b2224 + 65 , correcting for its projection to the adopted minor axis of the jet ( a factor of @xmath00.88 ) , and thus supports an association between the pulsar and jet - like feature .",
    "as mentioned previously , there is evidence for excess extended emission along the minor axis of the jet in the second epoch compared to the first .",
    "this excess emission can also be seen in fig .",
    "2a , b through the apparent widening of the jet - like feature over the two epochs . examining the two epoch surface brightness profiles",
    ", there is little deviation between epochs , after correcting for the previously determined shift , except for the excess emission region , located @xmath07 - 17@xmath18 away from the left sharp edge .",
    "the presence of this region will not effect our previous edge determination due to its distance from the left sharp edge and our choice of filter . following a method similar to the extension along the major axis ,",
    "the region of excess extended emission is found to have a count rate that is 0.28@xmath160.11@xmath44 higher in the second epoch than in the first , which has a total count rate ( sky background included ) of 0.64@xmath160.06@xmath44 . given the high detection significance of the excess emission in the second epoch ( @xmath05@xmath15 ) , it is very unlikely that it is artificial or statistical in nature ; although a physical explanation for the excess emission is perhaps even more enigmatic than the jet or counter feature .",

    "* ) and are likely unrealistic . from our spectral analysis",

    "there is also indication for further spectral variation along the jet , including spectral hardening farther from the pulsar and softening counter to the pulsar proper motion , although these trends are only marginally detected ( with @xmath70 significance ) .",
    "based on our two epoch x - ray analysis of b2224 + 65 and the jet - like feature , we have verified the proper motion of the pulsar and have shown similar motion in the sharp leading edge of the jet , providing strong evidence for its association with the pulsar . along the major axis of the jet , a region of extended x - ray emission ( hereafter counter feature ) , detected with @xmath04@xmath15 confidence ,",
    "is found near the pulsar and opposite the jet .",
    "the jet also appears wider , due to a significant ( @xmath05@xmath15 ) region of excess emission , with a harder spectrum in the second epoch compared to the first whereas additional spectral evolution across the major and minor axes is more ambiguous .",
    "given the low confidence for many of the spectral variations , including softening counter to the direction proper motion , the physical nature of the jet - like feature remains puzzling .",
    "here , we briefly examine two candidate physical scenarios for the production of the jet based on current results .    to begin with ,",
    "let us first consider the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model assumes that the jet represents electrons that have been accelerated at the termination shock of the pulsar wind which then leak out of the bow shock and diffuse into an ambient medium containing a large - scale plane - parallel magnetic field .",
    "the orientation of the jet - like feature feature would then correspond to the direction of the magnetic field , which needs to be unusually strong ( @xmath71 g ) . as stated by @xcite",
    ", this scenario would predict motion for the jet - like feature consistent with b2224 + 65 , softening of the jet spectrum counter to the direction of proper motion due to synchrotron cooling of particles injected at different times and the presence of a counter feature .",
    "our two epoch observations support many of these predictions though the spectral variation can not be positively confirmed .",
    "additional spectral variations , such as hardening between epochs and away from the pulsar along the jet major axis , are difficult to explain under this scenario . if the jet spectrum was observed to soften away from the pulsar , then one may naturally expect synchrotron cooling to be responsible ; however , the observed hardening implies acceleration within the jet feature , unlikely for particles confined by a magnetic field .",
    "hardening between epochs may suggest variation in the acceleration of the energetic particles , possibly due to changes in the pulsar wind and/or ism properties .",
    "however , the lack of spectral evolution for the pulsar advocates against any such deviations at the terminal shock if , in fact , a significant portion of the pulsar emission results from the ism - pulsar wind interaction .",
    "furthermore , the relative faintness of the counter feature posses a challenge for the @xcite model , as the energetic electrons should have no preference in which direction along the magnetic field they travel , though this issue may be rectified by internal anisotropies and asymmetry of the pulsar wind .    alternatively , the b2224 + 65 extended x - ray features may represent the externally processed particles from jets , akin to those associated with agns . in this scenario ,",
    "the main jet - like feature , counter feature and the guitar nebula represent the pulsar jets and equatorial wind outflow where the latter is responsible for the formation of the guitar nebula trailing the pulsar .",
    "x - ray emission is not expected in the pulsar wind forming the nebula as the particles are not energetic enough to generate detectable x - ray synchrotron radiation .",
    "the pulsar jets , intrinsically relativistic and containing highly energetic particles , may easily escape the bow shock but are ultimately confined by the large ram - pressure generated by the pulsar s motion . in this scenario ,",
    "the spectrum of the jet - like feature would soften counter to the direction of proper motion , similar to the @xcite model , due to synchrotron cooling .",
    "if enhancement of the x - ray emission due to the high ram - pressure contributes significantly to the x - ray emission , then spectral variation between epochs may arise from density variations in the ism resulting in post - processing variations of the energetic particles ( i.e. through their acceleration and/or synchrotron cooling efficiency ) .",
    "ism variation over time has been seen previously by @xcite where they found a decrease in the local density by a factor of @xmath00.7 between 1994 and 2001 ; however , any such density contrast can not be directly confirmed given the current two epoch _",
    "observations and the relatively static pulsar spectrum .",
    "spatial variations of the ism could also explain the spectral hardening away from the pulsar through similar post - processing of the energetic particles .",
    "the relative faintness of the counter feature compared to the main jet - like feature may be due to doppler effects if they are indeed relativistic and aligned along the line of sight ; specifically , if @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the bulk flow velocity and @xmath74 is the angle along the line of sight .",
    "further constraints may be possible by invoking more detailed jet mechanics and synchrotron theory .",
    "the ballistic jet scenario was deemed unlikely by @xcite , as it would predict a ratio between the length and width of the jet - like feature ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively ) that is too small to match observations ( @xmath77 pc and @xmath78 pc for d@xmath79 ) along with significant bending in the jet based on comparisons of the bow shock pressure , transverse momentum added to the jet through the ism ram - pressure and its the initial momentum . following @xcite , we may estimate the expected bending angle of the jet - like feature under the ballistic jet model by assuming that the pulsar imparts a constant fraction @xmath80 of its spin - down energy into the jet , which has a transverse size of @xmath76 .",
    "balancing the transverse and initial momenta , the angle @xmath74 describing the bending of the jet may be given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the ism ionization fraction and mean molecular weight , respectively , and @xmath84 is the pulsar proper motion .",
    "if we assume a fully ionized ism composed mostly of hydrogen ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) with number density @xmath87 and dimensions for the proposed jet as taken from current observations , then such a ballistic jet should trail behind the pulsar regardless of the value of @xmath80 ; strongly suggesting against the jet interpretation .",
    "however , the actual jet may be very narrow ( @xmath88 pc ) , similar to agn jets , and/or the ism could be largely neutral in which case the expected bending angle would be significantly reduced .",
    "a largely neutral ism would contribute little to the ram - pressure as the mean free path of neutral atoms is much larger than the width of the feature ( @xmath00.1 pc for neutral hydrogen atoms with density @xmath89 ) ; however , this would impose a fine - tuning problem on the jet - ism interaction where the number density for the small ionized fraction must still be large enough to generate the confining ram - pressure and accelerate the energetic particles to x - ray emitting energies .",
    "an additional complication of the jet interpretation is the misalignment of the spin axis ( believed to be correlated with pulsar jets ) and the direction of b2224 + 65 s proper motion ; nevertheless , the method by which pulsars or their progenitors acquire such high velocities remains uncertain ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "certainly , additional and more detailed theoretical modeling , which may require additional observations in order to confirm apparent spectral trends , will be necessary to further test the jet and @xcite models .",
    "using the available two epoch _",
    "observations , we have presented an x - ray morphological and spectral study of the pulsar b2224 + 65 and its apparent extended linear x - ray - emitting features .",
    "we confirm b2224 + 65 s proper motion over the two epochs and find little variation in its spectrum .",
    "additionally , we find motion in the sharp leading edge of the jet - like feature that is consistent with the proper motion of the pulsar . the jet is found to be significantly harder and wider in the second epoch than the first with spectral variation along its major and minor axis detected only marginally .",
    "these observations are somewhat consistent with magnetically confined `` leaking '' of energetic particles as proposed by @xcite as well as a typical jet interpretation ; although there are certain limitations to each of these scenarios . in the @xcite model , it is difficult to explain the faintness of the counter feature as well as the spectral variations between epochs , if verified . on the other hand , it is difficult to imagine a jet being responsible for the observed emission unless the jet is actually very thin and unresolved , similar to agn jet outflows , or if the ism is mostly neutral , which would then impose fine - tuning of the ism number density and ionization fraction . detailed spectral and theoretical modeling following pulsar ejecta interacting with the ism and/or an ambient magnetic field , including turbulent effects within the ejecta , will be necessary in order to place any further constraints on the physical origin of the jet given current observations .",
    "additional observations may then be required for confirmation of the observed spectral trends and place definite constraints on the origin of this enigmatic x - ray feature .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referees for their helpful comments on improving the manuscript and acknowledge eric gotthelf for his comments in developing the calibration and analysis for the extended feature .",
