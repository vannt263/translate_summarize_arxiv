    "let@xmath3 , @xmath4 , denote the deligne - mumford compactification of the moduli space of smooth @xmath0-pointed genus @xmath5 curves . as explained in @xcite , there exists a stratification @xmath6 whose codimension @xmath7 strata @xmath8 , @xmath9 , can be thoroughly described by genus @xmath5 graphs with a finite set @xmath10 of vertices , a finite set of edges @xmath11 and characterised in the following way :    * each vertex can have labelled half - edges , which we shall refer to as leaves , with labels in the set @xmath12 ; * there exists a map @xmath13 ; * for each vertex @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of edges issuing from @xmath14 and @xmath17 is the number of leaves stemming from @xmath14 ; * @xmath18 the topological genus of the graph .",
    "observe that a graph with @xmath19 , for every @xmath14 , and without loops is simply a tree .",
    "let us now consider @xmath20 , @xmath21 , ( @xmath22 ) , which is easily seen to be a union of quasi - projective subvarieties @xmath23 . with each @xmath24 we can associate a graph which describes all the elements contained in a codimension @xmath25 stratum , but not in its closure .",
    "we will make use of this stratification to calculate generating functions for the euler characteristic of @xmath26 , @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , given a graph @xmath27 associated with @xmath24 there exists a morphism @xmath28    which is described as follows .",
    "each vertex @xmath14 of the graph corresponds to a smooth @xmath29- pointed genus @xmath30 curve @xmath31 $ ] which is attached to another curve , corresponding to another vertex , through one of the marked points @xmath32 , @xmath33 . by the multiplicativity of the euler characteristic",
    ", this means that @xmath34 is generically given by the product of euler characteristics of each moduli space corresponding to vertices of @xmath27 . in some cases , depending on the symmetries of the graph",
    ", we should take into account a symmetric group action .    by the additivity of the euler characteristic",
    ", we just have to find out how to enumerate all the graphs involved in the complete description of boundary strata . to this end , we introduce the generating function for trees , which satisfies the following recursive relation : @xmath35    and observe that our graphs are obtained by some particular configurations to which trees are attached ( see sections [ graphs ] and [ k2 ] for these configurations and the definition of * graph - type * ) .",
    "we can finally state our main results .",
    "consider the generating function @xmath36    then the following theorems hold .",
    "[ genus1 ] @xmath37    [ genus2 ] @xmath38 \\text{,}\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath39 .",
    "although a generating function for @xmath40 has already been found by getzler in @xcite , we propose an elementary and simplified algorithm to determine it .",
    "this will allow the reader to become more familiar with calculations for the genus @xmath1 case .",
    "while preparing this work , we came to know that a generating function for @xmath41 has been found by j. harer ; even if our computation works in theory for every genus @xmath5 , at the moment it turns out to be effective only for small genera , but in these cases it provides very direct algebraic formulas for the sought - for generating functions .",
    "we also notice that for the computation we need to know the characteristic of the open sets @xmath42 ( when @xmath43 ) : although a general method to compute @xmath44 can be found in @xcite , our paper is self - contained , since we shall make explicit calculations for @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 on the basis of a convenient stratification as suggested in @xcite .",
    "we also checked that our results , for low @xmath0 , coincide with the ones obtained by e. getzler in @xcite , and with some recent computations of him , which he kindly informed us about .",
    "we would like to thank e. arbarello , m. cornalba and j. harer for their help and encouragement during the development of our work .",
    "many of our explicit computations were performed using _ mathematica _ ; we are grateful to d. finocchiaro for his patience in teaching us to use it .",
    "as remarked in the introduction , we shall compute @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 summing the contributions provided by the euler characteristic of the subvarieties @xmath24 represented by graphs . when computing the characteristic associated with each graph , we have to deal with the characteristic of @xmath53 and some of its quotients with respect to the symmetric group action which permutes the marked points .",
    "furthermore , we will need quotients of products of @xmath53 with respect to suitable actions of the symmetric group .",
    "in addition , these quotients are also useful to describe strata in the stratification introduced in sections [ m2n ] and [ m1n ] in order to compute directly the characteristic of the open sets @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this section is devoted to these computations , which are of independent interest and will be carried out using two different techniques .",
    "on one side , one can study the @xmath56-invariants in the rational cohomology ring of @xmath53 ( subsection [ invariant ] ) , and on the other side one can employ geometric arguments involving branched covering ( subsection [ geometric ] ) . in this last subsection , we are going to use some results of section [ m1n ] , namely the formula for the euler characteristic of @xmath54 ; nevertheless this formula will be proved without assuming any of the previous results of this paper .",
    "obviously , we start by recalling the euler characteristic of @xmath53 . this is provided by the following    for @xmath57@xmath58    * proof . *",

    "we notice that when @xmath67 the quotient map @xmath68 is unramified , since any automorphism of @xmath69 fixing three or more points is the identity .",
    "this implies that @xmath70    the following subsection provides a description of the @xmath56 module @xmath71 which allows us to compute the euler characteristic of the quotient spaces @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the following well known theorem of invariant theory points out the relations between the cohomology ring of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and the @xmath65-invariants in @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be a variety and @xmath79 a finite group which acts on @xmath78 .",
    "then    @xmath80    [ inva ]    let us first recall some results about the symmetric group action on @xmath77 .",
    "for every @xmath57 and every @xmath66 we will denote by @xmath81 ( resp .",
    "@xmath82 ) the character of the @xmath65 representation on @xmath77 ( resp . on @xmath83",
    "furthermore , we will denote by @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively the characters of the trivial and standard representations of @xmath65 .",

    "this implies that @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "it remains to prove the last assertion , which can be formulated as @xmath102 then we can write @xmath103 @xmath104 which , applying theorem [ indotto ] , is equal to @xmath105 the second addendum can be easily computed using the branching rule and is equal to @xmath106 .",
    "this completes the proof .",

    "in fact we then observe that the top cohomology of @xmath121 has degree @xmath106 and we can apply lemma [ almeno ] . for @xmath122",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the quasi - projective subvarieties @xmath382 of @xmath383 are in correspondence with a collection of genus @xmath384 graphs with @xmath385 leaves . considering a graph @xmath386 of this collection , its contribution to the euler characteristic is provided by the product of the euler characteristics of the moduli spaces associated to its vertices .",
    "now it turns out that all the genus @xmath384 graphs ( with any number of leaves ) can be obtained by attaching trees to some loops or to some vertex representing a curve of genus greater than 1 .",
    "therefore , if we let @xmath387 to be a generating function which counts the contributions of trees to the euler characteristic , the computation of the series @xmath388 reduces to the sum of the contributions of all the possible combinations of loops and vertices with genus greater than 1 , multiplied by a suitable power of @xmath387 .",
    "let us then give the following suitable definition of @xmath387 :    @xmath389 here the second sum ranges over the collection of `` admissible trees '' , which are all the oriented rooted trees on @xmath385 numbered leaves with the following two further properties    1 .",
    "there is an unlabelled half - edge going into the root .",
    "the tree is stable , that is to say , for every vertex of the tree the number of outgoing edges ( including the leaves ) , plus 1 , is greater than or equal to 3 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath390 is the euler characteristic of the stratum of @xmath391 which corresponds to @xmath392 .    as an example of the way in which we use @xmath387 , the contribution to @xmath393 of all the graphs of the following kind    [ fun1 ]",
    "can be computed by means of the series @xmath394    let us now focus on the series @xmath387 : we can easily find a recursive relation for it noticing that , if we cut an edge which stems from the root of a genus 0 admissible tree , the cut part is again a genus 0 admissible tree .",
    "therefore we can write the following recursive relation for @xmath395 ( which was taken as a definition in the introduction ) : @xmath396 substituting the values for @xmath397 we obtain @xmath398 which , after differentiating with respect to @xmath399 gives @xmath400    @xmath401 this is a differential equation that allows us to compute recursively all the coefficients of @xmath402 @xmath403    we notice that , in computing euler characteristics , we will often come across the series @xmath404 , which can be equivalently written in the following way @xmath405 and summarizes the contribution provided by trees that stem from a vertex of a polygon .",
    "let us now pass to motivate the introduction of two different operations on generating series , namely the derivative with respect to @xmath406 and the derivative with respect to @xmath399 .",
    "let us consider a graph @xmath407 of the following kind    [ fun2 ]    or more generally a graph which is made by two components of genus 1 attached by a genus 0 path .",
    "when computing the contribution of such graphs to the series @xmath408 , we can imagine to cut the picture in the following way    [ fun3 ]    what remains on the left is a graph @xmath409 of genus 1 with the artificial leaf @xmath410 , while on the right there is another graph @xmath411 of genus 1 with the artificial leaf @xmath412 instead of a tree .    a first approximation to the contribution of such graphs is provided by @xmath413 . in fact    1 .",
    "the factor @xmath414 takes into account the contribution of the left part of the graph .",
    "the derivative with respect to @xmath399 cancels the mistake due to the presence in @xmath409 of the leaf @xmath410 which is not a leaf of @xmath415 .",
    "the factor @xmath416 takes into account the contribution of the right part of the graph .",
    "the derivative with respect to @xmath387 is the translation in terms of generating series of the presence , in @xmath417 , of the artificial leaf @xmath412 instead of a tree .",
    "the coefficient @xmath418 is needed since in general there are two possible ways to cut the graph @xmath407 .",
    "there are some exceptional cases ; for instance one is provided by the following configuration , which should be carefully looked at :    [ fun4 ]    here and from now on , when we draw a dotted line outgoing from a vertex we mean that any number of trees can stem from the vertex itself .    in this case",
    ", the contribution to @xmath408 turns out to be equal to @xmath419 instead of @xmath420 which was implicit in the expression @xmath421 .",
    "in this section we obtain with our elementary and direct methods the generating function for the genus one case , which was already calculated by getzler in @xcite .",
    "there are two different contributions which should be considered : the first one comes from graphs of this kind    [ gen1 ]    and is exactly @xmath422 the second contribution comes from the graphs containing a loop , and is @xmath423 where the action of @xmath171 exchanges the last two markings , simultaneously in the second case .",
    "it can be written as @xmath424 summing up we get the generating function for genus @xmath248 .",
    "let us consider the set @xmath426 of graphs representing boundary components of the moduli space of genus @xmath1 pointed curves , including the one representing the open part .",
    "we define the * graph - type * of each graph as the graph obtained by deleting the markings , contracting all trees , and smoothing each vertex of valence @xmath1 .",
    "there are seven different graph - types , and we denote by @xmath427 the collections of graphs of each type .",
    "we count separately the contribution these sets give to the generating function for the characteristic of @xmath2 .",
    "the group of automorphisms @xmath428 of the graph - type acts on @xmath429 , and generically the contribution should have coefficient @xmath430 ; in this general formula we should `` correct '' the contribution of the components corresponding to graphs with non trivial stabilizer . in this case , the stabilizer of the graph acts generically non - trivially on the boundary component , since it acts on the added markings of the irreducible components of the curve . if there are enough markings on this component , the action is free , and nothing changes in the coefficient @xmath430 ; but , for a low number of markings , we should analyze the contribution this component gives independently .",
    "( which are of type @xmath336 ) give the contribution @xmath431 in the generic formula , since the graph - type has automorphism group of order @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , what we should really put in the formula is @xmath432 , where @xmath171 permutes the two added markings .",
    "the two formulas coincides for @xmath251 , when the action becomes free , but the initial terms should be corrected .",
    "these graph - types could be considered together , as they all could be seen in exactly two different ways as the union of a genus @xmath248 graph with one cut leaf , and a genus @xmath248 graph with one cut tree .",
    "we recall that the generating function for the genus @xmath248 case is @xmath435 the generic contribution is : @xmath436 @xmath437 moreover , the group exchanging the two sides of the graph type fixes the following graphs of type @xmath1 and @xmath366 :        the fourth graph requires a little more work : in fact we have to analyze the action of @xmath171 on @xmath441 which is free for @xmath442 . for the case",
    "@xmath443 , the action is trivial , whereas for the case @xmath252 , the quotient map is generically @xmath444 , and it is ramified on @xmath445 \\times \\delta \\text{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath446 is the diagonal in @xmath447 .",
    "thus we get @xmath448 once more we should replace @xmath439 with @xmath395 .                                        the contribution of these graphs ( here and from now in the pictures a pentagon stands for any polygon with more than three edges ) is @xmath473 where in the formula we have @xmath474 , and finally we have                                        the stabilizer is a subgroup of order @xmath1 of @xmath486 , and we should put @xmath496 instead of @xmath497 , and , for the case @xmath498 , since we already corrected part of this term , we substitute @xmath499 to @xmath500 ."
