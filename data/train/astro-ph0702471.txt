    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) at sufficiently close distances ( @xmath6 ) have been found to be accompanied by luminous and energetic type ic supernovae ( sne ic ) called hypernovae ( hne ; grb  980425/sn  1998bw : @xcite ; grb  030329/sn  2003dh : @xcite , @xcite ; grb  031203/sn  2003lw : @xcite ) .",
    "these grb - associated hne ( grb - hne ) are suggested to be the outcome of very energetic black hole ( bh ) forming explosions of massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ejected @xmath0ni  mass is estimated to be @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) which is @xmath8 times larger than typical sne ic [ @xmath9 ; @xcite ] .    for recently discovered nearby",
    "long - duration grb  060505 ( @xmath10 , @xcite ) and grb  060614 ( @xmath11 , @xcite ) , no sn was detected .",
    "upper limits to brightness of the possible sne are about 100 times fainter than sn  1998bw [ i.e. , @xmath12 .    a small amount of @xmath0ni  ejection has been indicated in the faintness of several type ii sne ( sne ii , e.g. , sn  1994w , @xcite ; and sn  1997d , @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated explosion energies , @xmath13 , of these faint sne  ii are very small ( @xmath14ergs , @xcite ) .",
    "these properties are well - reproduced by the _",
    "spherical _ explosion models that undergo significant fallback if @xmath13 is sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "thus these faint sn explosions with low @xmath13 seem to be superficially irreconcilable to the formation of energetic grbs @xcite . however , nomoto et al .",
    "( 2006a ; see also @xcite ) has predicted the existence of `` dark hypernovae '' ( i.e. , long grbs with no sne ) based on the argument in the next paragraph .",
    "in this letter , we present actual hydrodynamical models in which a high - energy narrow jet produces a grb _ and _ a faint / dark sn with little @xmath0ni  ejection .",
    "an indication that some faint sne produce high - energy jets is seen in the abundance patterns of the extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath15 .",
    "it has been suggested that the abundance patterns of these emp stars show the nucleosynthesis yields of a single core - collapse sn ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , the c - enhanced type of the emp stars have been well explained by the faint sne @xcite , except for their large co / fe and zn / fe ratios ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the enhancement of co and zn in low metallicity stars requires explosive nucleosynthesis under high entropy . in a `` spherical '' model",
    ", a high - entropy explosion corresponds to a high - energy explosion that inevitably synthesizes a large amount of @xmath0ni .",
    "one possible solution to this incompatibility is that some faint sne are associated with a narrow jet within which a high - entropy region is confined @xcite . if this would be a realistic model for the emp stars , some faint sne would accompany sufficiently energetic jets to produce grbs .    in this letter",
    ", we present hydrodynamical and nucleosynthetic models of the 40 @xmath2 star explosions with relativistic jets .",
    "we show that these models can explain the existence of grb - hne and grbs without bright sne in a unified manner .",
    "we suggest that both grb - hne and grbs without bright sne are bh - forming sne involving relativistic jets and that these explosions are responsible for the formation of the emp stars .",
    "we investigate the jet - induced explosions ( e.g. , @xcite ) of the @xmath16 population iii stars @xcite using a multi - dimensional special relativistic eulerian hydrodynamic code ( @xcite ; n.  tominaga , 2007 , phd thesis , in preparation ) .",
    "we assume that the explosions of the @xmath16 population iii stars involve relativistic jets in analogy with the @xmath16 pop i grb - hne , since the fe core masses of population iii and population i stars are similar .",
    "we inject the jets at a radius @xmath17 km , corresponding to an enclosed mass of @xmath18 , and follow the jet propagation . since the explosion mechanism of grb - hne is still under debate ,",
    "the jets are treated parametrically with the following five parameters : energy deposition rate ( @xmath19 ) , total deposited energy ( @xmath20 ) , initial half angle of the jets ( @xmath21 ) , initial lorentz factor ( @xmath22 ) , and the ratio of thermal to total deposited energies ( @xmath23 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the dependence of nucleosynthesis outcome on @xmath19 for a range of @xmath24 .",
    "the diversity of @xmath19 is consistent with the wide range of the observed isotropic equivalent @xmath25-ray energies and timescales of grbs ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "variations of activities of the central engines , possibly corresponding to different rotational velocities or magnetic fields , may well produce the variation of @xmath19 .",
    "we expediently fix the other parameters as @xmath26ergs , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 in all models .",
    "the thermodynamic history is traced with marker particles representing individual lagrangian elements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the nucleosynthesis calculation is performed as post - processing and includes 280 species up to @xmath30br ( see @xcite , table  1 ) . because recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest that the electron fraction ( @xmath31 ) is affected by neutrino processes , we assume @xmath32 in the fe core to maximize the co / fe ratio @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic history of the jet is also traced by the marker particles . in computing the jet composition ,",
    "we assume that the jet expands adiabatically from the schwartzshild radius to the inner boundary of the computational domain , and that the jet initially has the composition of the accreted stellar materials .",
    "the details will be presented in future work .",
    "in order to inject the jet , the ram pressure of the jet ( @xmath33 ) should overcome that of the infalling material ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "@xmath33 is determined by @xmath35 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , thus being constant in time in the present models . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath34 decreases with time , since the density of the outer materials decreases following the gravitational collapse ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for lower @xmath19",
    ", @xmath33 is lower , so that the jet injection ( @xmath36 ) is realized at a later time when the central remnant becomes more massive due to more infall .",
    "after the jet injection is initiated , the shock fronts between the jets and the infalling material proceed outward in the stellar mantle .",
    "figure  [ fig : fallback ] is a snapshot of the model with @xmath37 at 1 s after the start of jet injection .",
    "when the jet injection ends , the jets have been decelerated by collisions with the dense stellar mantle and the shock has become more spherical .",
    "the inner material is ejected along the jet - axis but not along the equatorial plane . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer material is ejected even along the equatorial plane because the infall along the equatorial plane is terminated as the shock reaches the equatorial plane ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : edotni ] shows the dependence of the ejected @xmath38 on the energy deposition rate @xmath19 . for lower @xmath19 , smaller @xmath38",
    "is synthesized in explosive nucleosynthesis because of lower post - shock densities and temperatures ( e.g. , @xcite ; maeda & tominaga 2007 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "while the materials in the c+o layer fall through the inner boundary , @xmath34 decreases only moderately , being almost constant ( @xmath39 @xmath40 ) during this phase because of the relatively shallow pre - sn density gradient in the c+o layer ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    if @xmath41 , @xmath42 so that the jet injection is initiated below the bottom of the c+o layer , leading to the synthesis of @xmath43 . if @xmath44 , on the other hand , @xmath45 so that the jet injection is delayed until @xmath34 decreases below @xmath33 and initiated near the surface of the c+o core ; then the ejected @xmath0ni  is as small as @xmath46 .    @xmath0ni  contained in the relativistic jets is only @xmath47 to @xmath48 because the total mass of the jets is @xmath49 in our model with @xmath50 and @xmath26ergs .",
    "the @xmath0ni  production in the jets is predominant only for @xmath51 in the present model ( fig .  [ fig : edotni ] ) .",
    "the models can not synthesize @xmath0ni  explosively and eject very little @xmath38 ( @xmath52 ) .      for high energy deposition rates ( @xmath53 ) , the explosions synthesize large @xmath38 ( @xmath54 ) being consistent with grb - hne .",
    "the remnant mass was @xmath55 when the jet injection was started , but it grows as material is accreted from the equatorial plane .",
    "the final bh masses range from @xmath56 for @xmath57 to @xmath58 for @xmath59 , which are consistent with the masses of stellar - mass bhs @xcite .",
    "the model with @xmath60 synthesizes @xmath61 and results in @xmath62 .",
    "since the jet injection with large @xmath19 is in short timescale and terminated before the jets reach the surface of the c+o core , the asphericity of the ejecta inside the c+o core for @xmath53 is probably consistent with a relatively oval explosion as indicated by the light curve and spectra of grb - hne @xcite .",
    "neutrino annihilation has been estimated to provide only a small energy deposition rate ( e.g. , @xmath63 ; @xcite ) , leading to the synthesis of smaller @xmath38 than is required for grb - hne . in order to synthesize a sufficient amount of @xmath0ni",
    ", large @xmath19 should be produced via some mechanism , e.g. , magneto - rotation ( @xcite ; another possibility , @xmath0ni production in the disk wind , is discussed in @xcite ) .      for low energy deposition rates ( @xmath44 ) ,",
    "the ejected @xmath0ni  masses [ @xmath46 ] are smaller than the upper limits for grbs  060505 and 060614 .",
    "the final bh masses range from @xmath65 for @xmath66 to @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "while the material ejected along the jet direction involves those from the c+o core , the material along the equatorial plane is ejected only from the outer part of the h envelope .",
    "thus @xmath69 exceeds the c+o core mass @xmath70 for the @xmath16 star .",
    "if the star lost the h and he envelopes before its core collapsed , and if the explosion is viewed from the jet direction , we would observe grb without sn re - brightening .",
    "this may be the situation for grbs  060505 and 060614 .      for intermediate energy deposition rates ( @xmath71 ) ,",
    "the explosions eject @xmath72 and the final bh masses are @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting sn is faint [ @xmath74 or sub - luminous [ @xmath75 .",
    "nearby grbs with faint or sub - luminous sne have not been observed .",
    "possible reasons may be that ( 1 ) they do not occur intrinsically , i.e. , the energy deposition rate is bimodally distributed , or that ( 2 ) the number of observed nearby grbs is still too small . for case 1",
    ", the grb progenitors may be divided into two groups , e.g. , with rapid or slow rotation and/or with strong or weak magnetic fields . for case 2",
    ", future observations will detect grbs associated with a faint or sub - luminous sn .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : edotni ] shows the dependence of the abundance ratio [ c / fe ] on @xmath19 .",
    "lower @xmath19 yields larger @xmath69 and thus larger [ c / fe ] , because the infall decreases the amount of inner core material ( fe ) relative to that of outer material ( c ) ( see also @xcite ) . as in the case of @xmath38 (  3.1 )",
    ", [ c / fe ] changes dramatically at @xmath76 .",
    "the abundance patterns of the emp stars are good indicators of nucleosynthesis in a single sn because the galaxy was effectively unmixed at [ fe / h ] @xmath77 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they are classified into three groups according to [ c / fe ] : ( 1 ) [ c / fe ] @xmath78 , normal emp stars ( @xmath79 [ fe / h ] @xmath77 , e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) [ c / fe ] @xmath80 , carbon - enhanced emp ( cemp ) stars ( @xmath79 [ fe / h ] @xmath77 , e.g. , cs  22949 - 37 ; @xcite ) ; ( 3 ) [ c / fe ] @xmath81 , hyper metal - poor ( hmp ) stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath82 , e.g. , he  01075240 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; he  13272326 , @xcite ) .",
    "figure  3 shows that the general abundance patterns of the normal emp stars , the cemp star cs  22949 - 37 , and the hmp stars he  01075240 and he  13272326 are reproduced by models with @xmath83 , 3.0 , 1.5 , and 0.5 , respectively ( see table  1 for model parameters ) . the model for the normal emp stars",
    "ejects @xmath84 , i.e. a factor of 2 less than sn  1998bw . on the other hand , the models for the cemp and the hmp stars eject @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , which are always smaller than the upper limits for grbs  060505 and 060614 .",
    "the lack of the metal - poor stars at @xmath87 [ fe / h ] @xmath88 is explained by the narrow range of @xmath89 . the n / c ratio in the models for cs  22949 - 37 and he  13272326 is enhanced by partial mixing between the he and h layers during pre - sn evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have computed hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis for the explosions induced by relativistic jets .",
    "we have shown that ( 1 ) the explosions with large @xmath19 are observed as grb - hne and their yields explain the abundances of normal emp stars , and ( 2 ) the explosions with small @xmath19 are observed as grbs without bright sne and are responsible for the formation of the cemp and the hmp stars .",
    "we thus propose that grb - hne and grbs without bright sne belong to a continuous series of bh - forming sne with the relativistic jets of different @xmath19 .",
    "presently , the number fraction of grbs without bright sne relative to the known nearby grbs is @xmath90% ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , among the emp stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath15 , the fractions of the cemp and the hmp stars relative to the emp stars are @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the numbers of observed grbs and the emp stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath15 are still too small to discuss statistics , the fraction of grbs without bright sne is consistent with the sum of the fractions of the cemp and the hmp stars . thus grbs  060505 and 060614 are likely related to the cemp stars ejecting @xmath3 to @xmath4 or hmp stars ejecting @xmath93 .    a short grb , probably the result of the merger of two compact objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) , synthesizes",
    "virtually no @xmath0nibecause the ejecta must be too neutron - rich .",
    "in contrast , our model suggests that grbs  060505 and 060614 produced @xmath94 or @xmath5 .",
    "if such a grb without a bright sn occurs in a very faint and nearby galaxy , our model predicts that some re - brightening due to the @xmath0nidecay can be observed .",
