    "nonparametric density estimation techniques are widely used to construct an estimate of a density function and to provide valuable information about several features of the underlying population ( e.g. , skewness , multimodality , etc . ) without imposing any parametric assumptions .",
    "these methods are very popular in practice and their advantages over histograms or parametric techniques are greatly appreciated .",
    "for example , they are widely used for both descriptive and analytic purposes in economics to examine the distribution of income , wages and poverty ( e.g. , minoiu and reddy , 2012 ) ; in environmental and ecological studies ( e.g. , fieberg , 2007 ) ; or in medical research ( e.g. , miladinovic et al . ) , among others .",
    "most of these density estimation techniques are based on simple random sampling ( srs ) design which involve independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "samples from the underlying population .",
    "there are only a few results available when the sampling design is different ( e.g. , buskrik , 1998 ; chen , 1999 ; gulati , 2004 ; lam et al . , 2002 ;",
    "barabesi and fattorini , 2002 ; breunig , 2001 , 2008 ; opsomer and miller , 2005 ) .",
    "the properties of nonparametric kernel density estimation based on i.i.d .",
    "samples are well known and extensively studied in the literature ( e.g. , wand and jones , 1995 ; silverman , 1986 ) . in many applications ,",
    "however , the data sets are often generated using more complex sampling designs and they do not meet the i.i.d .",
    "examples include the rank - based sampling techniques which are typically used when a small number of sampling units can be ordered fairly accurately with respect to a variable of interest without actual measurements on them and this can also be done at low cost .",
    "this is a useful property since , quite often , exact measurements of these units can be very tedious and/or expensive .",
    "for example , for environmental risks such as radiation ( soil contamination and disease clusters ) or pollution ( water contamination and root disease of crops ) , exact measurements require substantial scientific processing of materials and a high cost as a result , while the variable of interest from a small number of experimental ( sampling ) units may easily be ranked .",
    "these rank - based sampling designs provide a collection of techniques to obtain more representative samples from the underlying population with the help of the available auxiliary information .",
    "the samples obtained from such rank - based sampling designs often involve independent observations based on order statistics which are not identically distributed .",
    "so , it is important to develop kernel density estimators of the underlying population using such data sets and study their optimal properties .    in this paper",
    ", we study the problem of kernel density estimation based on a partially rank - ordered set ( pros ) sampling design .",
    "ozturk ( 2011 ) introduced pros sampling procedure as a generalization of the ranked set sampling ( rss ) design . to obtain a ranked set sample of size @xmath1",
    "one can proceed as follows .",
    "a set of @xmath1 units is drawn from the underlying population .",
    "the units are ranked via some mechanism rather than the actual measurements of the variable of interest .",
    "then , only the unit ranked as the smallest is selected for full measurement .",
    "another set of @xmath1 units is drawn and ranked and only the unit ranked as the second smallest is selected for full measurement . this process is repeated @xmath1 times until the unit ranked the maximum is selected for the final measurement .",
    "see chen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , wolfe ( 2004 , 2012 ) and references therein for more details .    in rss",
    ", rankers are forced to assign unique ranks to each observation even if they are not sure about the ranks .",
    "pros design is aimed at reducing the impact of ranking error and the burden on rankers by not requiring them to provide a full ranking of all units in a set .",
    "under pros sampling technique , rankers have more flexibility by being able to divide the sampling units into subsets of pre - specified sizes based on their partial ranks . ozturk ( 2011 ) obtained unbiased estimators for the population mean and variance using pros samples .",
    "he also showed that pros sampling has some advantages over rss .",
    "hatefi and jafari jozani ( 2013a , b ) showed that the fisher information of pros samples is larger than the fisher information of rss samples of the same size .",
    "since 2011 , pros sampling design has been the subject of many studies . among others ,",
    "see gao and ozturk ( 2012 ) for a two - sample distribution - free inference ; ozturk ( 2012 ) for quantile estimation ; frey ( 2012 ) for nonparametric estimation of the population mean ; arslan and ozturk ( 2013 ) for parametric inference in a location - scale family of distributions , and hatefi et al .",

    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce some preliminary results and present a general theory that can be used to obtain nonparametric estimates of some functionals of the underlying distribution based on imperfect pros samples . in section 3 , we present a nonparametric kernel density estimate of the underlying distribution based on an imperfect pros sampling scheme and study its properties .",
    "we also consider the problem of density estimation when the distribution of population is symmetric . in section 4 ,",
    "we consider the problem of estimating the misplacement probabilities . to this end , we propose a modified em - algorithm to estimate the probabilities of subsetting errors .",
    "this algorithm is fairly simple to implement and simulation results show that its performance is satisfactory . in section 5 ,",
    "we compare our pros density estimate with its rss and srs counterparts using simulation studies .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we illustrate our proposed method by a real example .",
    "in this section , we first give a formal introduction to pros sampling design and then present some notations and preliminary results .",
