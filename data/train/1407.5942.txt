    "in the modeling of phase transformations it is often of interest to consider surface - energy - driven motion of interfaces ( see the work of gurtin  @xcite @xcite @xcite , the recent review by taylor , cahn , and handwerker  @xcite , and the references therein ) . if the surface energy is isotropic this leads to motion by mean curvature , i.e.  the normal velocity of the interface equals its mean curvature . if the surface energy is anisotropic the associated evolution equation has been called `` motion by weighted mean curvature '' ( see the review taylor  @xcite ) .    when the surface energy is `` strictly convex '' the evolution law is a quasilinear parabolic equation .",
    "the isotropic case falls in this class . when the surface energy is `` crystalline '' the surface must be faceted and its evolution law reduces to a family of ordinary differential equations for the lengths of the faces .",
    "the mathematical theory of surface - energy - driven motion of interfaces is discussed at length in angenent and gurtin @xcite , developing upon an extensive materials science literature of which herring @xcite is representative .",
    "the essential aspects are summarized in an appendix , for the reader s convenience .",
    "we emphasize that familiarity with this theory is _ not _ assumed in the present work , though it provides the motivation and the context for what we do",
    ".    there has recently been intense mathematical activity concerning the analysis of motion by ( weighted ) mean curvature ( see for example angenent and gurtin  @xcite @xcite , brakke  @xcite , chen , giga , and goto  @xcite , de mottoni and schatzman  @xcite , evans and spruck  @xcite @xcite , gage and hamilton  @xcite , grayson  @xcite , gurtin  @xcite , huisken  @xcite , and sethian  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of crystalline surface energies has also received considerable attention both with regard to statics ( energy minimization ) ( see sullivan @xcite and taylor @xcite ) and with regard to dynamics ( motion by weighted mean curvature ) ( see almgren , taylor and wang  @xcite , angenent and gurtin  @xcite , ohnuma and sato  @xcite , and roosen and taylor  @xcite ) .",
    "we provide these references for the interested reader ; the only one we actually need in this paper  is  @xcite .",
    "it is a geometrically natural idea to approximate a strictly convex energy by a crystalline one .",
    "this idea has recently been analyzed by sullivan in @xcite , but only for problems of energy minimization .",
    "`` crystalline approximation '' has been used in applications without rigorous justification as a method for computing motion by weighted mean curvature in the context of closed curves and surfaces , because it replaces a parabolic differential equation with a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "this paper  represents a first attempt to establish its convergence .",
    "we study the simplest possible case : the interface is the graph of a function of one variable .",
    "our main result is the convergence of a `` crystalline '' scheme for solving a quasilinear parabolic equation in one space dimension .",
    "we prove convergence in @xmath0 , with a specified rate .",
    "our method is somewhat similar to the convergence analysis for a galerkin approximation ( see e.g. thome  @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that the `` crystalline '' discretization considered here is quite different from any of the more standard schemes from numerical analysis .",
    "the approximate solution is a piecewise linear function of the spatial variable , with `` pieces '' that have fixed slopes and variable lengths .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to finite difference and finite element methods ( where it is the spatial grid that is fixed ) , to front tracking ( which places no constraint on the slopes of the approximate solution ) , and to spectral methods .",
    "the recent paper of fukui and giga @xcite is closely related to the present work .",
    "they prove a general existence and uniqueness theorem for motion of graphs by weighted curvature ( by adapting the theory of nonlinear semigroups ) , which applies to a wider class of interfacial energies and even to `` incompatible '' initial data . when the surface energy is `` crystalline '' and the initial data is piecewise linear and compatible ( i.e.  has the `` right '' slopes ) their solution is the same as ours .",
    "they prove continuous dependence on the initial data and on the form of the interfacial energy .",
    "this fact would suffice to prove convergence of our approximation scheme .",
    "the result we prove here is sharper , however , because we get a specific convergence rate in the @xmath0 norm .    in another paper @xcite",
    "we prove convergence of the crystalline algorithm for the motion of a simple closed convex curve by weighted curvature .",
    "this is done by parametrizing the weighted curvature by the angle between the interface normal and a fixed coordinate axis , and comparing it with the weighted curvature of the approximate solution .",
    "it turns out that the crystalline approximation scheme corresponds to a standard finite difference scheme for the ( nonlinear ) evolution equation for the weighted curvature .",
    "the organization of this paper  is as follows : in section  2 we set up the scheme and make some preliminary observations . in section  3 we study the case of the ordinary heat equation . in section",
    "4 we prove convergence for general convex energies and constant dirichlet boundary conditions . in section  5",
    "we prove convergence for constant neumann boundary conditions . in section  6",
    "we set up the general dirichlet problem .",
    "however , for general dirichlet boundary conditions we do not prove convergence of the scheme because we have been unable to prove that the approximate solution exists up to a fixed time as the discretization gets finer .",
    "it seems plausible that , under suitable growth conditions on the energy , one should be able to bound the slope of the approximate solutions .",
    "then convergence would follow as in section  4 .",
    "finally , section  7 is an appendix which outlines the physical and mathematical context of our work .",
    "this paper is part of the first author s ph.d . thesis .",
    "this paper is concerned with the convergence of an approximation scheme for the equation    @xmath1 for now we focus on the case of homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath2 postponing consideration of other boundary conditions to sections  5 and 6 .",
    "if @xmath3 ,  @xmath4  is the curvature of the graph of @xmath5 , and in general it is the negative of the gradient of @xmath6 or the weighted curvature of the graph of @xmath5 .",
    "so eq .  ( )",
    "says that the normal velocity of the graph of @xmath5 equals its weighted curvature .",
    "we assume throughout that @xmath7 is strictly convex and @xmath8 , and that eq .",
    "( ) has a @xmath8 solution in @xmath9\\times [ 0 , t]$ ] .",
    "the existence of a @xmath8 solution is guaranteed by theorem  @xmath10 and the regularity results of ladyenskaja , solonnikov , and uralceva  @xcite when @xmath7 and @xmath11 are sufficiently smooth , @xmath11 satisfies compatibility conditions at zero and one , and @xmath7 satisfies certain growth conditions .",
    "appropriate growth conditions are discussed in section  6 ( see especially conditions  ( 32 ) ) .",
    "the numerical scheme considered in this paper arises by deriving an analogue of eq .",
    "( ) in the setting where @xmath7 is substituted by a piecewise linear function , , which coincides with @xmath7 at its corners ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "we now carry out this derivation .",
    "as explained in the appendix , this has been done in a slightly different way by gibbs ( see the review taylor  @xcite ) .",
    "the equations we will arrive at have been obtained in a physical context by angenent and gurtin @xcite .",

    "the function + coincides with @xmath7 at its corners .",

    "we will refer to the set of all such functions as the set of admissible functions . for now , the parameter @xmath14 has no meaning by itself , but later on it will be the maximum distance between two such adjacent values of @xmath13 , and it will determine the rate of convergence of the scheme , thus playing a role similar to the one that the mesh size does in a finite difference scheme .",
    "we order the faces from left to right . at selected times",
    "faces will disappear and each time this happens we reorder them . so the number of faces is a piecewise constant function of time denoted simply by @xmath15 .",
    "we usually keep the time dependence of such functions implicit .",
    "the exception will be @xmath5 s time dependence and that of its first argument , when that argument is itself a function , which we often make explicit .",
    "let @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) be the abscissa of the @xmath18th corner of @xmath12 , @xmath19 be the length of the projection of the @xmath18th face on the @xmath20-axis , and  and  be the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , for the @xmath18th face of @xmath12 .",
    "first of all , we focus on the initial data",
    ". define @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that    _ @xmath24 belongs to the set of admissible functions , satisfies the boundary conditions , and jumps in @xmath25 correspond to adjacent corners of _  ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "( )    this is a reasonable assumption , and we make it because our scheme will move but not create faces .",

    "second , we impose the boundary conditions . since @xmath27",
    "we have to choose @xmath28 for them to be satisfied .",
