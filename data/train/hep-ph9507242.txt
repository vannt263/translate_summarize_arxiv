    "one of new directions in the heavy quark physics is related with a description of baryons with two heavy quarks @xcite . in a large heavy quark mass limit ,",
    "a typical size of a @xmath10-diquark configuration is much less than the characteristic radius of light hadrons @xmath11 . for light quarks ,",
    "the heavy - heavy diquark object looks like a heavy antiquark at low virtualities , so that one can relate the @xmath12-baryon characteristics with the properties of a meson with a single heavy quark @xcite .",
    "the form factors of the doubly heavy baryons are straightforwardly related with those of heavy light mesons @xcite , described by the isgur - wise functions , up to the accuracy of a probability for the transition of the doubly heavy diquark to another one .",
    "the latter point of view to the @xmath10 diquark allows one also to formulate some rules , describing the process of the @xmath12 baryon production @xcite .",
    "first , the process under consideration can be represented as the process of a hard production of the @xmath10 diquark , that further has a hadronization into the @xmath12 baryon .",
    "the hadronic production of the diquark with a mixed flavor is calculated under the analogy with the @xmath13 heavy quarkonium production , on the basis of computations of the fourth @xmath3-order diagrams in the qcd perturbation theory .",
    "second , the nonperturbative soft part of the matrix element describes the quark binding in the @xmath10 diquark and it is given by the diquark wave function at the origin .    at present , the basis for the current estimates of the @xmath12 baryon production cross section is the consideration of the @xmath10 diquark production cross sections at large transverse momenta via the fragmentation mechanism @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation function of the heavy quark @xmath14 is taken in the same form as the function of fragmentation into the heavy quarkonium @xmath13 @xcite with the same quantum numbers over the lorentz group .",
    "this approach is quite excusive and valid in the high energy @xmath15-annihilation , where the fragmentational mechanism does practically dominate @xcite , but the situation is more complex for the hadronic production @xcite .",
    "the complication is caused by that a number of the leading order diagrams , describing the hadronic production of doubly heavy diquark , is much greater than the number of diagrams in the @xmath15-interaction .",
    "moreover , the former diagrams do not allow one completely to interpret them in terms of the fragmentational mechanism .",
    "the fragmentation is not exactly defined in the hadronic production . as was shown @xcite ,",
    "the diagrams of the recombinational type give a dominant contribution even at quite large transverse momenta .",
    "so , a simple formula , corresponding to the convolution of the differential cross section of the heavy quark production with the function of the heavy quark fragmentation into the @xmath16 quarkonium or @xmath10 diquark , gives only a cross section evaluation in the order of magnitude . to obtain an exact result",
    "is necessary to take into account all 36 diagrams of the fourth order over @xmath3 .",
    "in what follows , we present the results of exact calculations for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 baryons yields in the framework of the computations for the heavy quark pair production in the fourth order diagrams of qcd .",
    "the difference between the given approach and the fragmentational one is connected with that the contribution of the complete set of diagrams is calculated with no neglection of a part of them .",
    "for the states with a various quantum numbers , the performed calculations result in the yield ratios , different from those of in the approximate approach of the fragmentation .",
    "the calculation technique , applied in the present paper , is analogous to that of the hadronic production of @xmath19 mesons @xcite .",
    "the only difference is due to the binding of two heavy quarks ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) in contrast to the binding of a heavy quark with a heavy antiquark .",
    "we suppose that the binding energy in the diquark is much less than the masses of quarks , composing the diquark , and hence , the quarks are on the mass shells .",
    "therefore , the quark four - momenta are related with the diquark momentum @xmath22 in the following way @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the diquark mass , @xmath25 are the quark masses .    in the given approach",
    ", the diquark production can be described by the 36 leading order feynman diagrams , corresponding to the production of four free quarks in the way of combining of two quarks into the colour antitriplet diquark with the given quantum numbers over the lorentz group .",
    "the latter procedure is performed by means of the projection operators @xmath26 for the scalar state of diquark ( the corresponding baryon is denoted as @xmath27  ) , @xmath28 for the vector state of diquark ( the baryons are denoted as @xmath29 and @xmath30  ) .",
    "to produce the quarks , composing the diquark , in the @xmath31-state , one has to introduce the colour wave function as @xmath32 , into the diquark production vertex , so that @xmath33 is the colour index of the first quark , @xmath34 is that of the second one , and @xmath35 is the colour index of the diquark .    the diquark production amplitude @xmath36 is expressed via the amplitude @xmath37 for the free quark production in kinematics ( [ 1 ] ) as @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the spiralities of corresponding quarks , @xmath40 are its colour indices , @xmath41 is the diquark radial wave function at the origin , and the @xmath42 operators have the following explicit form ( @xmath43 ) @xmath44 for the scalar state , and @xmath45 for the vector one .    in the numerical calculations , giving results , which will be discussed in the next section ,",
    "we suppose the following values of parameters @xmath46 where the @xmath47 value has been calculated by means of a numerical solution of the schrdinger equation with the martin potential @xcite , multiplied by the 1/2 factor , caused by the colour antitriplet state of quarks instead of singlet one , and the @xmath48 value is taken from ref.@xcite for the sake of convenience of the result comparison .    to calculate the production cross section of the diquarks , composed of two @xmath49-quarks , one has to account for their identity .",
    "one can easily find , that the antisymmetrization over the identical fermions leads to the scalar diquark production amplitude , equal to zero , and it results in that the amplitude of the vector @xmath50-diquark production can be obtained by the substitution of equal masses in the amplitude of the vector @xmath51-diquark production with the account for the 1/2 factor , following from the identity of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "we assume , that the produced diquark has the fragmentation into the baryon , practically carrying away a total diquark momentum , with the unit probability .",
    "therefore , discussing the results , we will talk on the differential cross sections of @xmath52 and @xmath2 baryons production , since we suppose that the latters negligibly small deviate from the differential cross sections of diquarks .",
    "the total energy dependence of the gluonic production cross sections of @xmath0 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath54 ) baryons is shown on fig.1 and in tab.1 .",
    "to compare , the predictions of the fragmentational mechanism for @xmath1 ( solid line ) and @xmath0 ( dashed line ) are also presented .",
    "one can see from the figure , that the fragmentational production mechanism , assuming the validity of factorization in the cross section at @xmath55 and at large transverse momenta via the formula @xmath56 with @xmath57 , does not work at low gluon energies , where it overestimates the cross section , because of the incorrect evaluation of the phase space , and it is not valid also at large energies , where the predictions of the fragmentational mechanism are essentially less that the exact results .",
    "so , the fragmentational values underestimate the @xmath1 and @xmath0 cross sections in 9 and 4 times , respectively , at @xmath58 gev .",
    "when the fragmentational predictions give the ratio @xmath59 , the exact perturbative calculations result in @xmath60 even at @xmath58 gev .",
    "the agreement with the fragmentational production at @xmath58 gev is poor even at large transverse momenta of the baryon , as one can see from the distributions over @xmath61 for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 production , shown on fig.2 in comparison with the predictions of the fragmentational mechanism .",
    "note , that in contrast to the doubly heavy baryon production , the exact perturbative calculations of the gluonic production of @xmath62 mesons with @xmath63 gev at @xmath58 gev agree with the fragmentational predictions . for the baryon production ,",
    "a visible deviation is observed up to the largest values of @xmath61 .    the differential cross section @xmath64 of the @xmath65 production in @xmath66 interactions at @xmath67 tev",
    "is presented on fig.3 in comparison with the fragmentational predictions . in the @xmath19 meson production",
    ", the difference between the exact and fragmentational approaches was slightly hidden due to the convolution with the hadron structure functions . in the process of baryon production , this is not the case , and the invalidity of the fragmentational approach explicitly follows from the form of the distribution under consideration .    the calculation results on the @xmath2 production point out that the deviation between the exact perturbative and fragmentational values is also essential as in the @xmath1 production .",
    "this disagreement can be noted on fig.4 and in tab.2 , where the dependence of the @xmath2 production cross section on the energy of the gluon interactions is presented , as well as on fig.5 , where the differential cross section @xmath64 of the @xmath2 production in the gluon interactions is shown at @xmath58 gev in comparison with the fragmentational mechanism predictions . from the latter figure",
    ", one can see that even at @xmath68 gev , the exact result slightly overestimates the fragmentation .    the differential cross section @xmath64 of the @xmath2 production in @xmath66 interactions at the energy @xmath67 tev",
    "is shown on fig.6 in comparison with the fragmentational estimate .",
    "one can see , that at the reasonable values of @xmath61 , the fragmentational result is approximately 3 times less than the exact perturbative one .    at the chosen values of parameters and with the account for the cuts over the transverse momentum and rapidity of the baryons ( @xmath8 gev and @xmath9 ) ,",
    "the production cross section of the @xmath69-wave @xmath17-baryons and its antiparticles is evaluated as @xmath70 nb , and the total cross section of the @xmath69-wave @xmath18-baryon production with the account for antiparticles is equal to @xmath71 nb . after the expected end of run ib at tevatron with the integral luminosity @xmath72 , one has the yields of @xmath73 of @xmath17-baryons and @xmath74 of @xmath18-baryons .",
    "thus , we have shown , that the calculations in the leading order approximation of the qcd perturbation theory for the gluonic production of the doubly heavy diquarks , having the hadronization into the baryons , lead to the essential discrepancy in the differential as well as total cross sections of the baryon production in comparison with the predictions of the mechanism of the heavy quark fragmentation into the diquark .",
