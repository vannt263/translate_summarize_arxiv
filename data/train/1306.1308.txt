    "<S> we simulate ultracold sagnac atom interferometers using quantum - mechanical matter wavepackets , e.g. bose - einstein condensates , that counter - propagate within a rotating ring - trap . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the accumulation of the relative phase difference between wavepackets , i.e. the matter wave sagnac effect , is manifested as discrete phase jumps . </S>",
    "<S> these plateaus result from three effects ; that the atoms should be initially trapped at rest with respect to the rotating frame , that they counter - propagate with the same group velocities in the rotating frame , and that the imaging is performed in the rotating frame . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the plateaus persist in the presence of nonlinear atom - atom interactions , and in atoms undergoing various rotations , and thus will occur during matter wavepacket experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce the simplest possible sagnac atom interferometry scheme which relies on wavepacket dispersion around a ring - trap .    </S>",
    "<S> the sagnac effect was first demonstrated experimentally for light one hundred years ago by french physicist georges sagnac  @xcite and , in recent years , atoms have begun to exhibit a rotation measurement sensitivity able to go beyond that of light - based systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sagnac effect is an interference phenomena of waves encountered in rotating frames of reference that can be used to measure absolute rotations with respect to an inertial frame  @xcite , such that the phase - shifts are well - known , well - tested , and are given by  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle mass , @xmath2 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath3 is the speed of light , and @xmath4 is the wavelength of the light . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the shift is proportional to the magnitudes of the areal vector @xmath5 and the angular velocity vector @xmath6 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : schematic](a ) ) , however , it is ( to first - order ) independent of the velocity of the rotating matter waves  @xcite . the optical sagnac effect has not only been used to address fundamental scientific questions ( e.g. as in the michelson - gale - pearson experiment  @xcite ) , but it has also found technological applications . in particular , the sagnac effect is the fundamental basis of rotation measurements made with fiber - optic and ring - laser gyroscopes  @xcite , which are currently deployed in many high - precision inertial navigation systems .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) initial location of the various wavepackets and the areal vector @xmath5 orientations of the ring - traps considered in this paper , all undergoing the same rotation rate @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) schematic of our sagnac thought experiment with localised matter waves as seen in the inertial ( non - rotating ) frame . for @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> the initial wavepacket is localised in a rotating trap potential ( i.e. with angular momentum @xmath8 ) , and at @xmath9 is symmetrically split into counter - propagating wavepackets in a ring - trap with different ( group ) velocities in the inertial frame . </S>",
    "<S> these collide and produce an interference pattern at @xmath10 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the sagnac effect has also been observed for matter waves , including neutrons  @xcite , neutral atoms  @xcite , electrons  @xcite and superfluids  @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we ignore the ( translated ) advice of malykin , who stated  quantum - mechanical calculations of the imaginary part of a wave function are not at all necessary to compute the phase - shift of de broglie counter - propagating waves in a rotating ring interferometer , attributable to the sagnac effect \"  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we present a theoretical scheme and calculations to elucidate how the sagnac effect is manifested in localized matter waves . </S>",
    "<S> the basic setup , schematically shown in fig .  [ fig : schematic](b ) , involves trapping a bec , splitting it into two counter - propagating waves within a ring - shaped atom trap , and allowing them to collide . instead of a linear accumulation of the phase - difference with time , we find perfectly - step - like jumps of the phase - shift between wavepacket collisions , with the magnitude of the phase jumps being exactly predicted by the sagnac formula </S>",
    "<S> . these plateaus will be observed in rotating bec experiments in the various geometries shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic](a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for developing sagnac systems with atoms is the potential improvement , @xmath11 over photons ( near optical wavelengths )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a state - of - the - art atom - based sagnac interferometer is currently able to achieve a precision comparable to ring - laser - based gyroscopes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was based on thermal atoms in a non - portable @xmath12  m long vacuum chamber with an enclosed area of @xmath13  mm@xmath14 , i.e. an effective circle of radius @xmath15  mm . </S>",
    "<S> while there are competing technologies developing compact sensors  @xcite , ultracold gaseous atoms in a vacuum chamber offer a flexible scaling of the geometry  @xcite , and thus could explore systematics on the fly . </S>",
    "<S> a bec - based rotation sensor would enable a relatively compact sensor with long experiment times  @xcite and the use of common mode noise rejection by making the atoms enclose loops , e.g. using guided bec configurations  @xcite and portable atom chips  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a sensor could be used on earth  @xcite , but it would also be feasible to send it into space  @xcite , in the search for physics beyond the standard model  @xcite . the best attempt so far at the measurement of the rotation of the earth in a bec experiment  @xcite enclosed areas of up to @xmath16 mm@xmath14 , i.e. an effective radius of @xmath17 @xmath18 m ( at the limit for being able to observe the earth s rotation ) , but was unable to do so due to technical challenges .    apart from schemes where a localised bec is split and traverses a guided path around the interferometer  @xcite , there have been schemes proposed to use the interference due to the counter - rotation of bec modes  @xcite which are yet to be realised experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> there has also been recent experimental progress in this direction with a sagnac measurement using sound - waves in a bec in a ring - trap  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key idea that differentiates such systems from the present paper is that their propagating bec modes fill up the ring - trap and hence they experience a linear accumulation of the phase shift , i.e. @xmath19 ) , that can be extracted at any measurement time . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for wavepackets we need to wait until a collision . </S>"
