    "the magnetized liner inertial fusion ( maglif ) concept@xcite is presently being investigated experimentally@xcite using the z facility@xcite at sandia national laboratories .",
    "maglif is part of a broader class of concepts referred to collectively as magneto - inertial fusion ( mif).@xcite these concepts seek to significantly reduce the implosion velocity and pressure requirements of traditional inertial confinement fusion ( icf)@xcite by using a magnetic field to thermally insulate the hot fuel@xcite from a cold pusher and to increase fusion product confinement .",
    "the maglif concept at sandia uses the electromagnetic pulse supplied by the z accelerator to radially implode an initially solid cylindrical metal tube ( liner ) filled with preheated and premagnetized fusion fuel ( deuterium or deuterium - tritium ) .",
    "the implosion is a result of the fast z - pinch process , where a large gradient in the applied magnetic field pressure operates near the liner s outer surface.@xcite one- and two - dimensional simulations of maglif using the lasnex radiation magnetohydrodynamics code @xcite",
    "predict that if sufficient liner integrity can be maintained throughout the implosion , then significant fusion yield ( @xmath1100 kj ) can be attained on the z accelerator when deuterium - tritium fuel is used and the accelerator s marx generators are charged to 95 kv to obtain a peak drive current of about 27 ma.@xcite    to maintain liner integrity throughout the implosion , liners with thick walls have been proposed@xcite and used experimentally.@xcite thick walls mitigate the deleterious effects of the magneto - rayleigh - taylor ( mrt ) instability,@xcite which first develops on the liner s outer surface , and then works its way inward , toward the liner s inner / fuel - confining surface , throughout the implosion .",
    "the parameter that is typically used to describe the robustness of a liner to the mrt instability is the liner s initial aspect ratio @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the liner s initial outer radius and @xmath4 is the liner s initial wall thickness .",
    "lower @xmath5 liners are more robust to the mrt instability , but their use results in slower implosion velocities ; thus , there is a tradeoff between liner robustness and implosion efficiency .",
    "two - dimensional lasnex simulations predict that liners with @xmath6 should be robust enough to keep the mrt instability from overly disrupting the fusion burn at stagnation.@xcite these preliminary lasnex simulations predict a broad optimum in the fusion yield surrounding @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "10 in ref .  ) .",
    "experiments@xcite on the z accelerator with no initial axial magnetic field have found the implosion dynamics of @xmath8 be liners to be in good agreement with the 2d lasnex predictions found in the original maglif paper@xcite ( e.g. , compare fig .  2 in ref .   with fig .",
    "9 in ref .  )",
    "by contrast , @xmath8 be liner experiments on the z accelerator that included an initial axial magnetic field of about 10 t have revealed the presence of a helical instability structure that is fundamentally 3d in nature,@xcite and thus could not be captured by the 2d lasnex simulations ; regardless , the inclusion of the initial axial field seems only to have improved overall implosion stability.@xcite moreover , the first fully - integrated experimental tests of maglif have shown that a fuel implosion driven by an @xmath8 be liner , combined with preheat and premagnetization , does indeed result in fusion relevant conditions on the z accelerator.@xcite therefore , we assume that the qualitative 1d versus 2d behavior shown in fig .  10 of ref .",
    "holds fairly true for @xmath9 , and thus that maglif can be modeled reasonably well in 1d for @xmath9 .    the leading hypothesis for what seeds the mrt development is the electrothermal instability ( eti).@xcite recent experiments have shown that eti growth can be tamped by applying a thick dielectric coating to the outer surface of the metal liner , thereby delaying the onset of nonlinear mrt growth.@xcite thus , it is hopeful that the application of dielectric coatings may enable maglif s 2d and/or 3d @xmath10 1d performance to be extended to liners with aspect ratios significantly greater than 6 .",
    "note that these assumptions do not account for possible azimuthal variations ; the effects of azimuthal variations on fuel confinement are beyond the scope of this paper , but they are presently being investigated in other studies.@xcite presumably , the deleterious effects of azimuthal variations are also mitigated by the use of low @xmath5 liners , and perhaps by dielectric coatings as well .",
    "since maglif calls for low @xmath5 liners to mitigate the mrt instability , the resulting liner implosions are too slow to shock heat the fuel ( i.e. , the fuel heating due to compression is approximately adiabatic ) .",
    "thus , to heat the fuel to fusion - relevant temperatures ( @xmath11 kev ) while simultaneously lowering fuel convergence requirements , the maglif concept calls for preheating the fuel just prior to the implosion .",
    "the parameter typically used to describe fuel convergence is the convergence ratio @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the initial and time - dependent radii of the fuel - liner interface , respectively .",
    "the convergence ratio is often evaluated at particular times of interest , such as the time of peak fusion power , @xmath14 , and the time of minimum @xmath15 , i.e. , the time of  bounce \" , @xmath16 . in many cases , @xmath14 and @xmath16 have fairly similar values , but differences between these two parameters can indicate important phenomena such as fuel collapse or fuel ignition . to reduce @xmath14 and @xmath16 requirements to @xmath17 ,",
    "the maglif concept calls for preheat temperatures of @xmath18 ev .    at the z facility",
    ", fuel preheating has been accomplished using the z beamlet laser ( zbl),@xcite which was originally coupled to the z pulsed - power accelerator for diagnostic purposes ( e.g. , radiography@xcite ) . in the first fully - integrated maglif experiments,@xcite zbl provided about 2 kj of 532-nm light in a 2-ns pulse .",
    "recently , zbl has been upgraded to deliver about 4 kj in a 4-ns pulse , and plans are in place to further increase zbl s delivered pulse energy to 6 kj and beyond over the next several years .    to keep the fuel hot during the relatively slow implosion of a maglif liner , the concept requires premagnetization of the fuel using an axially - aligned @xmath19 field .",
    "about 1050 t are to be supplied by external @xmath19 coils .",
    "this initial seed field is to be amplified by a factor of 10@xmath2010@xmath21 within the fuel - filled volume of the imploding liner via magnetic flux compression .",
    "this large axial field is required to mitigate energy loss from the fuel due to electron and ion thermal conduction .",
    "additionally , the axial field should enhance @xmath0-particle confinement and heating of the fuel , and thus increase the overall fusion yield .    in the first fully - integrated maglif experiments,@xcite as well as in liner implosion dynamics experiments,@xcite initial seed fields of up to 10 t",
    "have been supplied by a newly developed applied @xmath22 on z ( abz ) subsystem at the z facility.@xcite analysis of the neutron diagnostics data collected during the first fully - integrated maglif experiments indicates that significant flux compression did indeed occur.@xcite also , the abz capabilities at the z facility have recently been upgraded to 15 t , and plans are in place to further increase these fields to 30 t in the next couple of years.@xcite    to elucidate some of the key physics issues relevant to maglif , we have developed a new semi - analytic model of the concept .",
    "this model is formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that are straightforward to solve , particularly with standard software tools such as matlab^^ , idl^^ , mathematica^^ , etc . this model accounts for : ( 1 ) preheat of the fuel ( optionally via laser absorption ) ; ( 2 ) pulsed - power - driven liner implosion ; ( 3 ) liner compressibility with an analytic equation of state , artificial viscosity , internal magnetic pressure , and ohmic heating ; ( 4 ) adiabatic compression and heating of the fuel ; ( 5 ) radiative losses and fuel opacity ; ( 6 ) magnetic flux compression with nernst thermoelectric losses ; ( 7 ) magnetized electron and ion thermal conduction losses ; ( 8) end losses ; ( 9 ) enhanced losses due to prescribed dopant concentrations and contaminant mix ; ( 10 ) deuterium - deuterium and deuterium - tritium primary fusion reactions for arbitrary deuterium to tritium fuel ratios ; and ( 11 ) magnetized @xmath0-particle heating .",
    "this model has been implemented in a code called samm ( semi - analytic maglif model ) .",
    "simulations using samm typically take about 30 seconds to run on a laptop using the ode23 solver in matlab^^. using the parallel computing cluster at sandia , parameter scans of about 2000 simulations can be completed in as little as 10 minutes .",
    "semi - analytic models have proven themselves useful in the past.@xcite their fast run times allow the system parameter space to be explored rapidly .",
    "also , the physics included in semi - analytic models are often transparent and thus accessible by anyone , which is not always the case for more sophisticated codes ( e.g. , the lasnex code@xcite that the original maglif paper@xcite was based on ) .",
    "finally , one of the most important aspects of developing simplified models such as samm , is that it forces those involved to verify and understand the results generated by more sophisticated codes .",
    "for example , when differences are observed between a simple model and a more advanced code , can those differences be explained in terms of the simplifying assumptions made in the reduced model ?",
    "this type of questioning often leads to new physics insights that would otherwise be overlooked .",
    "for example , during the development of samm , we found an important relationship between radiative loss rates and the initial radial fraction of the fuel that is preheated ; this finding and others are discussed further in this paper .",

    "the pressure profile is flat throughout the fuel ( i.e. , we have made an isobaric assumption due to the subsonic nature of maglif implosions ) .",
    "the gas temperature and density profiles thus have an inverse dependence to one another ; their analytic expressions are given by eqs .",
    "[ tgr][rhogrshelf ] in the text .",

    "the gas temperature in the shelf region is equal to the radiation temperature ( i.e. , the fuel material and the radiation field are in thermodynamic equilibrium in the shelf region ) .",
    "the shelf region erodes away throughout the implosion , until @xmath35 , due to thermal transport from the hot spot to the shelf .",
    "the shelf region is only present if the fuel is preheated from @xmath33 to @xmath36 . ]",
    "the liner implosion , and thus the fuel implosion , is driven by the pressure associated with the azimuthal magnetic field , which is supplied by the pulsed - power driver ( e.g. , the z accelerator ) .",
