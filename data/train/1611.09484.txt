    "in the early 1960 s , bohr and mottelson pointed out some puzzling experimental data : some light nuclei thought to be spherical in shape had excited energy levels exhibiting characteristics of deformed nuclei .",
    "this was taken up first by engeland @xcite and then gerry brown , who saw an opportunity to test the realistic nuclear interactions that were being developed at the time .",
    "the nuclei @xmath0o and @xmath1o were the first subjects of study @xcite .",
    "as his graduate student , i worked on a parallel study of ca isotopes as part of my thesis project .",
    "later , a more definitive study of the ca nuclei was carried out by gerace and green @xcite . as a general conclusion",
    ", one saw that the mixing between shapes could be understood with the realistic interactions derived from nucleon - nucleon scattering data .    since those early days of nuclear structure physics",
    ", the subject of nuclear deformation has matured .",
    "first of all , we now know that the shape coexistence is ubiquitous in the low - energy spectra of nuclei across the periodic table , affecting even the fission properties of the heaviest nuclei .",
    "also , we now have computational tools to describe and predict the static features of the landscape of nuclear shapes",
    ". however , the dynamics of shape change , ie . how different shapes mix together , has been a challenging problem in the theory of heavy nuclei and is still not well understood .",
    "i shall describe some work i have been engaged in recently , to develop a new approach to fission dynamics in the spirit of the old studies on light nuclei .",
    "nuclei are highly deformable , and the first task is to construct reliable models of the nuclear potential energy surface , ie . the energy of configurations as a function of deformation coordinates such as the expectation values of quadrupole and higher moments .",
    "an immediate question is how to define both energy and shape of a configuration : the operators for these two quantities do not commute .",
    "the resolution of this conundrum is that we are only dealing with approximate wave functions , not the true eigenstates of the hamiltonian . in practice",
    ", theory relies on the mean - field representation of wave functions as products of single - particle orbitals .",
    "the present - day calculational framework is very similar to the density functional theory ( dft ) of condensed matter physics .",
    "one defines an effective interaction , which may depend on the local density .",
    "the energies and shapes are determined by minimizing the energy expectation value just as in hartree - fock ( hf ) theory .",
    "several families of dft in use today , and all have considerable predictive power on static properties of nuclei . in the examples discussed below",
    ", i will show results obtained with the gogny d1s functional .",
    "it has 14 parameters , 3 of them fixed and 11 adjusted many years ago @xcite to reproduce general nuclear properties .",
    "an example showing its considerable predictive power is recent systematic study of the low - energy spectroscopy of even - even nuclei @xcite .",
    "i will come back to findings from this study later .",
    "another success of the dft approach is verification of additional shape minima at very high deformation in heavy nuclei .",
    "the potential energy surface that a fissioning nucleus traverses has at least two minima and perhaps more .",
    "[ pes ] shows the energy versus deformation in a typical fissile nucleus .",
    "u covering the range of deformations up to the scission point .",

    "the point marked  i \" is the global minimum .",
    "the points marked  a \" and  b \" are saddle points on the fission path , with a second minimum  ii \" in between . , width=10 ]",
    "up to now , the only practical approach for treating shape dynamics in heavy nuclei is the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) proposed by hill and wheeler @xcite .",
    "formally , one generates a continuum of configurations by minimizing the hamiltonian in the presence of an external field .",
    "thus , the configuration @xmath2 is defined by minimizing _",
    "h - q | _ where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian or energy - density functional and @xmath4 is a one - body operator such as the axial quadrupole field q_20 = z^2 -(x^2+y^2)/2 .",
    "then one constructs an effective hamiltonian from information about the diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "computationally , the gcm can be implemented in two ways . in the first way ,",
    "the moment @xmath7 is treated as the position variable in a one - dimensional schrdinger equation .",
    "it is straightforward to derive formulas for potential energy function @xmath8 and a kinetic energy operator -12q 1(q ) q in approximations such as the gaussian overlap approximation @xcite .",
    "this one - dimensional collective approach works well for treating the ground state tunneling under the barriers , but generalizing it to include excited states is cumbersome @xcite .",
    "a more technical problem is necessity to define at least four or five deformation operators to completely specify the shape of the fissioning nucleus .",
    "it is possible , but not easy , to set up and solve the corresponding higher - dimension schrdinger equation ; a two - dimensional approximation was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second computational method is to discretize the gcm configurations with a mesh of @xmath9 values and minimize the hamiltonian in that finite basis .",
    "there are obstacles to this approach as well . on a purely technical level",
    ", the fact that the configurations are not orthogonal leads to numerical instabilities .",
    "more serious on a fundamental level , it is not clear how to calculate interaction matrix elements between configurations when they are constructed via an energy density functional .",
    "several plausible prescriptions are possible , but the results can be unphysical if the wrong prescription used @xcite .",
    "such problems never occurred in the early work on light nuclei ",
    "we used orthogonal bases and we had a pretty good idea of the interactions .    to build an alternative to the gcm approach , we should start by constructing an orthonormal basis within the mean - field framework . the dynamics can be developed later from the off - diagonal interactions in this basis . in the old work ,",
    "the basis was constructed from the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian by using the associated su(3 ) group structure to organize the many - body configurations .",
    "this is obviously too crude for treating heavy nuclei , and it is better to use the dft to build the orbitals . in the nuclear context , one could use dft orbitals and still preserve orthogonality by to constraining them by their quantum numbers rather than by their deformations . for most nuclei ,",
    "the mean - field potential is axially symmetric and has good parity at the dft minima .",
    "this allows one to assign orbital quantum numbers @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angular momentum about the symmetry axis and @xmath12 is the parity of the orbital .",
    "the dft minimization can be carried out taking as a constraint the number of nucleons having given values of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and isospin projection @xmath13 .",
    "wave functions that differ in filling numbers are automatically orthogonal , so this should be very helpful for constructing an orthogonal basis . in the remaining sections of this article",
    ", i will go through some examples illustrating the use of a @xmath10 partitioning to define the configurations .    before going on to the examples , it is instructive to see how the partitioning works in a semiclassical limit .",
    "assume that the nucleus is spherical and the phase space density is uniform in spheres of radius @xmath14 in coordinate space and @xmath15 in momentum space .",
    "then the number of nucleons having orbital quantum number @xmath16 is given by n_m = g^r d^3 r ^k_f d^3 k ( 2 ) ^3 ( m - ( r k)_z ) where @xmath17 is the spin degeneracy of the nucleon and @xmath16 is the orbital angular momentum about the @xmath18-axis . the integrals can be carried out analytically ; the result is n_m = 9 n 4k_f r ( ( 1/2 + x^2 ) arccos x - 3 x ( 1-x^2)^1/2 ) [ eq - semiclassical ] where @xmath19 .",
    "the same formula applies to ellipsoidally deformed nuclei with the radius @xmath14 replace by the transverse radius of the ellipsoid .",

    "the first excited state in the spectrum has angular moment zero , which is rare among the 600 or so known even - even nuclei .",
    "the excited @xmath24 together with the @xmath25 and @xmath26 above it form the lowest members of a rotational band .",
    "the evidence that these states are part of a band comes from the energy spacing and from the electromagnetic transition rates between states , indicated by arrows in the figure .",
    "the measured quadrupole transition strength between two lowest states in the band is @xmath27 e@xmath28 @xmath29 @xcite . on the scale of a single - particle quadrupole moment",
    "this is very large and would require an axis ratio of @xmath30 to model the band as an ellipsoidal rotor .",
    "the corresponding intrinsic mass quadrupole moment in the band is q_20 = 117  fm^2 .",
    "[ q - ca ]    now let us compare the gcm and the @xmath10-partition approaches to determine the structure of the band .",

    "there will be a small gain of energy when one takes into account that the calculated energy is that of the band as a whole , but the energy gain is probably too small to approach the experimental value .",

    "the competition between spherical and deformed configurations plays out differently .",

    "my ultimate goal is to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of fissioning nuclei .",
    "as mentioned at the beginning , the gcm approach works well for describing spontaneous fission as tunneling through a barrier in the potential energy surface .",
    "but when the excitation energy is above the barrier , it is far from clear what theoretical approach is justified . in any case , the spontaneous fission show that the part of the interaction responsible for pairing is very important @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation ( td - hfb ) might be appropriate for above - barrier dynamics .",
    "recently , computer power has become available to test the td - hfb for fission using current nuclear energy functionals .",
    "such a study was carried out by bulgac and collaborators @xcite .",
    "their starting point was a very deformed configuration past the second barrier and at a small excitation energy over the potential energy surface .",
    "they found that fission would take place , but the duration before the fragment formation could be very long .",
    "a weak point of the td - hfb approximation is that it takes into account only a very restricted set of interaction matrix elements to propagate the system from one configuration to another .",
    "namely , configurations that can be generated as two - quasiparticle excitations of the starting configuration are included in some way , but all four - quasiparticle transitions are neglected . in the example of configuration mixing in @xmath43ca , the hfb approximation would be useless .",
    "there is no pairing condensate , and even if there were one , the intermediate configurations are only partially represented by the allowed pair jumps .    while it would still be an enormous challenge to make a realistic treatment of fission in the discrete - configuration approach ,",

    "the more jagged curve above that is the gcm in the hf , ie . ignoring pairing effects .",
    "the hf configurations have definite @xmath10 partitions that change abruptly along the curve .",
    "the black dots are three configurations generated by the @xmath10-constrained minimization , with the partitions taken from the gcm results .",
    "it is interesting to compare the @xmath10 partitions found with the gogny d1s energy function with other simpler ways for building a many - particle wave function .",
    "the simplest is the nilsson model mentioned earlier .",
    "one finds that it gives exactly the same ground state @xmath10 partition as the dft .",
    "another model simpler than the dft is the finite - range liquid drop model @xcite . here",
    "the orbital energies are computed in a deformed potential well , but the shape of the well is determined by an energy functional based in part on the liquid drop model .",
    "it also gives the same @xmath10 partition as the other models .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath10 filling of the ground state is a quite robust property of the mean - field wave function . and",
    "it is certainly easier to specify , compared with the many shape parameters needed to describe unambiguously configurations obtained by the gcm .",
    "however , at the a and the ii points along the fission path the partition obtained with the gogny functional differs by one pair jump from the frld partition .",
    "it is likely that they are nearly degenerate , and would be mixed by the pairing interaction .    for dynamics ,",
    "an important consideration is the number of steps it takes to get from one configuration to another via the two - particle interaction in the hamiltonian .",
    "this suggests a distance measure between configurations as the number of pairing jumps needed to get from one to the other .",

    "the left - hand plot is the gcm in the hfb approximation , which is seen to be smooth with very little structure .",
    "the right - hand plot shows the same path in the hf approximation .",
    "it is broken into a sequence of segments , each segment having a specific @xmath10 partition . analyzing these segments",
    ", one can determine that it takes 6 pair jumps to get from i to a and 8 pair jumps to get from a to ii .",
    "but it would wrong to concluded that it takes 14 pair jumps to get from i and ii . in fact , examination of end - points reveals that the configuration ii can be reached from i by changing the orbits of only 6 pairs .",
    "that of course requires surmounting a higher potential barrier .",
    "which path is more important in the dynamics is not obvious ; one needs to know interaction matrix elements between configurations as well as their energies to begin to address this question .",
    "the configuration - interaction method has been very successful in light nuclei , and it should be possible , at least in a statistical way , to extend it to heavy nuclei .",
    "i have concentrated exclusively on the basis of wave functions , advocating the use of dft constrained by @xmath45 partitioning .",
    "this still leaves the interaction matrix elements to be determined .",
    "the same problem exists in condensed - matter theory , and there a hybrid approach has been quite successful @xcite .",
    "it would take a large effort to carry out this program in nuclear physics . however , there are good reasons , rooted in experimental findings , to undertake that effort . empirically , there is strong evidence that the fissioning nucleus is close to a statistical equilibrium near the scission point @xcite .",
    "the big open theoretical question is whether we can explain that in terms of hamiltonian dynamics with realistic interactions .",
    "fluctuation phenomena also remain unexplained . here",
    "are two examples . in 1978",
