    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) is one of the most mysterious phenomena in the universe .",
    "although there was a great revolution in our understanding on grbs in 1997 that some of them were proved to be of extragalactic origins  @xcite , there are still a lot of questions and puzzles left on the phenomena .",
    "that is why grbs have been the fascinating targets for astronomers .",
    "in fact , there are a lot of interesting and valuable discussions under debate . for example",
    ", we have not known what is the origin of grb .",
    "although this problem has never been settled and still controversial , there are some reports that suggest the physical connections between grbs and supernovae ( sne )  @xcite .",
    "if the sn / grb connection is correct , grbs will be born from the death of massive stars .",
    "then the grb event rate should trace the star formation history in the universe  @xcite .",
    "the central engine of a grb is an important but difficult problem to be solved .",
    "although a fireball model  @xcite is a promising and attractive one , we do not know how the initial condition is .",
    "we merely gave it artificially .",
    "in the fireball model , since the ratio of baryon number to photon number is required to be extremely small as an initial condition , only a peculiar environment could meet such a condition .",
    "as long as we believe the grb / sn connection , however , a collapsar ( failed supernova ) model  @xcite will be one of the convincing candidates as the central engine of a grb . in the model ,",
    "much energy is generated by the neutrino heating from an accretion disk surrounding a black hole which is made by the core collapse of a massive star .",
    "on the other hand , total explosion energy of a grb is also one of the most important problems in the physics of grbs .",
    "observationally it is well known that there is a large dispersion of total energy of gamma - rays emitted from grbs  @xcite .",
    "although the dispersion may become small when we consider the beaming effects  @xcite , after all we do not know the total explosion energy of the system that generates a grb only by the gamma - ray observations . in the theoretical side ,",
    "the total explosion energy in the collapsar model is also not estimated clearly , and only a rough estimate is reported as a result of the numerical computations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to know the total explosion energy , we require the multi - dimension numerical hydrodynamical computations including the microphysics of neutrino heating in future , which is , of course , a laborious task to be performed .",
    "are there observations which give us new clues to know how a grb is produced ? in this study , we point out that the grb neutrino background may be detected in a large water cherenkov neutrino detector such as super - kamiokande ( sk ) and titand which is proposed as a next - generation plan of the multi - megaton water cherenkov detector  @xcite .",
    "we also stress that this signal should give us valuable informations on grbs , such as the total explosion energy and/or event rate of grbs .",
    "the reason is as follows . in this study",
    ", we assume that the origins of grbs are massive stars .",
    "thus , the event rate of grbs should trace the star formation history in the universe . since we adopt the collapsar model here , we can assume that the central engine of a grb is the neutrino heating from an accretion disk surrounding the central black hole .",
    "we show that the total number of neutrinos emitted from a grb is very sensitive to the mass - accretion rate @xmath2 which is difficult to estimate only from the existing theoretical models .",
    "however , we can obtain the informations of the mass - accretion rate by observing the grb neutrino background .",
    "we also derive an approximate relationship between the total explosion energy and the mass - accretion rate of a grb .",
    "namely , although we can not determine the total explosion energy only from the gamma - ray observations , we can obtain informations of it by observing the grb neutrino background .",
    "that is an important clue to understand grbs . in this study",
    "we find that the grb neutrino background may be detected within @xmath0 10 yrs by titand as long as the average mass - accretion rate among grbs is @xmath3 a few @xmath4 s@xmath5 , and the probability that one collapsar generates a grb is @xmath6 @xmath0 0.5    1.0 .",

    "summary and conclusion are presented in section  [ summary ] .",
    "first we assume that the rate of grbs traces the global star formation history of the universe , @xmath7 .",
    "although a number of workers have modeled the expected evolution of the cosmic sfr with redshift , there are some uncertainties ( in particular , at high redshift @xmath8 ) , and further observations are required to determine the cosmic sfr . in this study , we use the three different parameterizations of the global star formation rate per comoving volume in an einstein - de sitter universe to take into account the uncertainty of the cosmic sfr which is derived by ref .",
    "they are @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 .    assuming that massive stars with masses larger than @xmath13 explode as grbs  @xcite  @xcite , grb - rate density @xmath14",

    "here we assumed that one tenth of the collapsars whose mass range is in ( 35  125)@xmath4 are accompanied with grbs ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the validity of this assumption and the detailed discussions are presented in section  [ discussion ] .",

    ".        in the collapsar model , neutrinos are mainly generated at the inner - most region of an accretion disk which is formed around the central black hole .",

    "@xcite , they assumed that the mass of the central black hole is constant . in this study , however , to estimate the total energy of neutrinos we consider the effects that the mass of the central black hole becomes larger with time by accretions .",
    "when we know the density and the temperature in the neutrino emitting region , we can estimate the emissivity of neutrinos ( @xmath36 ) in the accretion disk .",
    "the total emissivity of @xmath22 is represented by two terms : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is energy of @xmath22 . for @xmath39 , the emissivity of @xmath22",

    "( [ eq : temperature ] ) that as the mass of the central black hole grows , the temperature becomes lower , and the flux of neutrinos decreases . in fig .",

    "this almost corresponds to the timescale in which the temperature at the innermost region of the accretion disk becomes lower than @xmath0 1 mev .",
    "namely this will approximately reflect the timescale of a grb .",
    "now we investigate the dependence of the energy spectrum of anti - electron neutrino on the mass - accretion rate ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the mass - accretion rate is theoretically not known while the numerical simulations have been performed , because there are uncertainties on the viscosity of the accretion disk and angular momentum of the progenitor . in fig .",

    "this is because the temperature at the inner region of the accretion disk becomes higher .",
    "here we have to give some comments on the application limit for the present accretion disk model in this study .",
    "high energy electron - positron pairs whose energies are greater than @xmath74mev produce muons and charged pions , which , in turn , decay into low energy leptons .",
    "such microphysics is not included in the present model .",
    "the influence might become important for the high accretion rate model .",
    "in addition , as the density becomes large , the assumption that the neutrinos are optically thin might become to break down  @xcite .",

    "it is found that the differential number flux is similar with each other even if the different star formation history is adopted .",

    "as long as the collapsar model is adopted , the density profile of the progenitor should depend on the zenith angle and time .",
    "we are planning to investigate these effects in the near future .    when the mechanism of the central engine is not the neutrino heating but the blandford - znajek mechanism  @xcite , the observations of grb neutrino background will give a lower limit of the total explosion energy of a grb .",
    "we have estimated the flux of the grb neutrino background and computed the event rate at sk / titand in the collapsar models , assuming that grb formation history traces the star formation history .",
    "we have found that the flux and the event rate depend sensitively on the mass - accretion rate although the detection of signals from grbs seems to be difficult by sk . on the other hand , however , we have found that the grb neutrino background may be detected by titand within @xmath0 10 yrs as long as the average mass - accretion rate is high ( @xmath188 a few @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) , and the probability that one collapsar generates a grb is high ( @xmath6 = 0.5    1.0 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the informations on the mass - accretion rate of collapsar will be obtained by the observations of the grb neutrino background , which in turn , should give us informations on the total explosion energy of grbs in future .",
    "they are , of course , never obtained only by the gamma - ray observations .",
    "although there are some simplifications in our analyses and some uncertainties on the present observations , our proposal to determine the total explosion energy of a grb is very challenging and interesting .",
    "this paper is the maiden attempt about the grb neutrino background .",
    "we will revise our model to enhance the predictability , and our suggestions will be tested by the future observations .",
