    "an outstanding problem of considerable theoretical and experimental interest is the possible formation of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in collisions of nuclei at very high energies .",
    "since the collisions are very violent and the time scales involved are ephemeral , the answer to the question of whether a qgp is formed depends sensitively on the initial conditions for the matter produced in the collision .",
    "specifically , it requires an understanding of the distributions of partons in the wavefunctions of the two nuclei _ before _ the collision .",
    "what do these parton distributions look like ?",
    "it is well known that multi - particle production in high energy collisions is dominated by modes in the nuclear wavefunction which carry a small momentum fraction @xmath5 of the nuclear momentum  @xcite .",
    "understanding the correct initial conditions therefore requires that we understand the properties of these small @xmath5 modes . in recent years",
    ", a sophisticated effective field theory approach has been developed to describe properties of partons at small @xmath5  @xcite - these form a color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",
    "the cgc is characterized by a bulk scale @xmath6 which grows with energy and the size of the nuclei . for rhic energies ,",
    "if one assumes @xmath6 is a constant as for cylindrical nuclei , then @xmath7-@xmath8 gev  @xcite .",
    "the field strengths in the saturation region behave as @xmath9 : since @xmath10 , the field strengths are large .",
    "furthermore , the occupation number of saturated gluons is also @xmath11 .",
    "the initial conditions for nuclear collisions can be formulated in the cgc  @xcite .",
    "since the occupation numbers of the partons before the collision are large , the very initial stage of the nuclear collision can be treated classically . in practice",
    ", this means that one solves the yang - mills equations for two sources of color charge with initial conditions given by the classical fields of the two nuclei before the collision .",
    "this program is difficult to accomplish analytically , but it can be formulated and solved numerically  @xcite .",
    "an important assumption is that of boost invariance : the gauge fields are assumed not to depend on the space - time rapidity @xmath12 .",
    "the qcd hamiltonian ( in @xmath13 gauge , where @xmath14 is the proper time ) can then be formulated as a dimensionally reduced 2 + 1-d theory of transverse gauge fields coupled to an adjoint scalar field .",
    "numerically , the lattice analog of the dimensionally reduced hamiltonian is the kogut ",
    "susskind hamiltonian  @xcite coupled to an adjoint scalar field  @xcite .",
    "the space - time evolution of the classical gauge fields after the collision is obtained by solving , for each configuration of the color charge sources , hamilton s equations for the canonically conjugate momenta and fields . at late times",
    "@xmath15 the system is well approximated as a collection of weakly coupled harmonic oscillators , and the energy and number distributions can be computed accordingly for an su(2 ) gauge theory  @xcite and an su(3 ) gauge theory  @xcite after averaging over all color configurations .    in these earlier studies , nuclear collisions , for simplicity , were idealized as central collisions of infinite , cylindrical nuclei .",
    "the color charge squared @xmath16 was taken to be a constant for the uniform cylindrical nuclei .",
    "furthermore , color neutrality was imposed only in a global sense  @xcite , namely , the color charge distribution over the entire nucleus was constrained to be zero . while very useful in obtaining first estimates of the space - time evolution of the produced gluonic matter , these studies did not make predictions for realistic nuclear collisions . in addition , studies of the distributions in peripheral collisions , in particular of the azimuthal anisotropy associated with elliptic flow , require finite nuclei and realistic nuclear matter distributions within each nucleus . in a recent paper we implemented all of these realistic requirements to compute elliptic flow in the cgc model  @xcite . in this paper we will discuss the effects of imposing color neutrality in more detail and compute energy and number distributions as a function of centrality .",
    "strictly speaking , the results of our numerical simulations are only valid for very early times ( @xmath17 ) when the occupation numbers of the fields are large enough for the classical field approximation to hold .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the system can be treated by solving semi - classical transport equations .",
    "an interesting scenario of how thermalization may be achieved in this picture was discussed by baier et al .",
    "the results presented here can be used as initial conditions for detailed simulations of the equilibration dynamics in the early stage of heavy ion collisions  @xcite .    the results here",
    "can also be compared to the data on global observables from rhic , if one assumes parton - hadron duality  @xcite . remarkably , the cgc results on the centrality and energy dependence of charged particle multiplicities and on the rapidity and @xmath18 distributions appear to agree with data",
    ". however , there are data on the transverse energy per particle and on the elliptic flow ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) which appear to require additional assumptions beyond simple parton - hadron duality .",
    "we will discuss constraints from the data and from our simulations on our scenarios of equilibration and hydrodynamic flow in heavy ion collisions .",
    "finally , we will discuss @xmath4 collisions at rhic energies .",
    "this topic has recently attracted much theoretical interest recently  @xcite because of the likelihood that such ( more specifically @xmath21 ) collisions will be performed at rhic in the immediate future .",
    "this problem was first discussed in the classical framework by kovchegov and mueller  @xcite and subsequently by dumitru and mclerran  @xcite .",
    "both these authors derived analytical expressions for gluon production in @xmath4 collisons .",
    "in particular , dumitru and mclerran showed that the gluon distribution , while proportional to @xmath22 for @xmath23 , is proportional to @xmath24 in the kinematic region @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the color charges squared of the proton and nucleus respectively .",
    "reproducing these results is a test of our numerical framework and we will show that our results indeed agree well with the analytical expressions .    this paper is organized as follows . in the following section , we will discuss the numerical simulations of nuclear collisions with emphasis on improvements over previous work . in particular",

    "we will discuss in this section the mclerran - venugopalan model ( mv )  @xcite for ultrarelativistic nuclei with realistic nuclear matter distributions .",
    "we will compute the classical gluon distributions of the nuclei both before and after the collision .",
    "we first discuss parton distributions in a single nucleus in the mv approach  @xcite . in the original mv approach ,",
    "the color charge squared per unit area , @xmath16 , is taken to be much larger than the confinement scale (  @xmath28 ) .",
    "for realistic nuclei at finite energies , confining effects can not be ignored .",
    "for instance if in a finite nucleus no color neutrality condition is imposed , the gluon distribution outside the nucleus would be finite even if the distribution of color charges were localized .",
    "the issue of color neutrality in the mv model of a single nucleus was first discussed at length by lam and mahlon  @xcite . in their work , they considered large nuclei with uniform nuclear matter distributions . in this section , we will construct color charge distributions by imposing different color neutrality constraints at the nucleon level .",

    "the classical treatment of nuclear collisions can also be improved significantly .",
    "one such improvement is to give up the assumption of strict boost invariance and to study the effects of doing so on our distributions .",
    "another is to go beyond the simple assumption of gaussian - distributed color charges and to incorporate the effects of renormalization group evolution of the color charges at high energies .",
