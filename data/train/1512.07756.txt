    "the study of star - forming regions is one of the most eminent fields in astronomy .",
    "enhanced instrumental capabilities are now enabling us to investigate regions which were impossible to detect or resolve before .",
    "in particular , the advent of ( sub-)millimeter detectors is providing us with opportunities to plumb more deeply the mystery of star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) . to a large extent this is because dust usually becomes optically thin at the longer ( sub-)millimeter wavelengths .",
    "hence , estimates for total masses of molecular clouds , cores and envelopes become possible as the emission traces the entire structures @xcite .",
    "molecular clouds are the birthplaces of stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "numerous clouds are found in the local milky way . among them , the perseus molecular cloud has been studied for decades and is a proven star - forming factory .",
    "the perseus cloud extends over an area of about hundred pc@xmath6 , elongated from north - east to south - west with a length of 25 pc ( e.g. @xcite ) . with a total mass around @xmath7 @xcite ,",
    "it is filled with protostellar and star - forming clusters , such as ngc 1333 , l1448 , and l1455 .",
    "the very first molecular line surveys of the perseus ob2 association ( containing massive stars ) in @xmath1co @xcite and @xmath1co , @xmath8co , c@xmath0o @xcite , suggested a complex structure of the perseus molecular cloud , which is believed to be influenced by and thus , physically related to the ob2 association ( for a summary of the perseus cloud , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the distance to the perseus cloud has been a long - lasting controversy in the literature .",
    "measurements toward the eastern and western ends of the cloud reveal significant discrepancies .",
    "for example , @xcite suggests a distance of 220 pc to the western part ngc 1333 , while the _ hipparcos _ parallax census shows 320  pc for the eastern ic 348 @xcite .",
    "high - accuracy maser parallax measurements give @xmath4232  pc for l1448 .",
    "besides , a clear velocity gradient extending over @xmath450  pc in length from 3 km s@xmath9 in the western edge to 10 km s@xmath9 in the eastern end @xcite is thought to result from multiple structures overlapping along the line of sight @xcite , which adds further uncertainty to determining a unified distance .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. @xcite ) adopt a distance of 250 pc , which we also assume for the present work . at this distance",
    ", @xmath10 corresponds to about 250  au .          within the perseus cloud , besides the two young clusters ic 348 and ngc 1333 , there are mainly four small regions which are spawning new stars : b1 , b5 , l1448 , and l1455 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the l1455 cloud , being an intermediate mass case , possesses a suitable number of possibly interacting and forming stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it , thus , serves as an ideal testbed to study star formation in a cluster .",
    "furthermore , @xcite hinted that , in regions like l1448 and l1455 , the deeply embedded protostars are likely in their earliest stages of evolution .",
    "therefore , examining these regions is a key to understanding star formation in its early phase .",
    "the l1455 region @xcite encloses an area of about 7.6 pc@xmath6 , centered approximately at @xmath11(j2000)@xmath12 , @xmath13(j2000)@xmath14 .",
    "it contains 11 young stellar objects ( ysos ) , with the majority of them being in their early stages ( class 0/@xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "the first three protostars discovered in the _ _ iras _ _ catalogs are l1455 irs1 , l1455 irs2 , and l1455 irs3 @xcite . since then , more were found in the proximity of them .",
    "specifically , @xcite name three more protostars , l1455 irs4 , l1455 irs5 and l1455 irs6 , that are all clustered inside a small @xmath16 pc@xmath6 region .",
    "unfortunately , this area where more than half of the ysos reside , as well as the individual cores were seldom investigated in detail .",
    "in particular , the densest region in l1455 , encompassing a roughly 0.02 pc@xmath6 box centering on l1455 irs1 has never been studied with scrutiny .",
    "l1455 irs2 @xcite ( a.k.a .",
    "rno 15 @xcite or pp9 @xcite ) is probably the very first discovered yso in the region . @xcite",
    "provide early co images of outflows that initiated the discussion of the extended outflows observed around l1455 irs2 .",
    "an early nh@xmath17 survey also confirms these outflows @xcite .",
    "several herbig - halo objects were also identified via h@xmath11 and @xmath18 $ ] @xcite .",
    "@xcite use both @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath1co lines to analyze these outflows , finding a dominant northwest - to - southeast elongated outflow overlapping a smaller one perpendicular to it .",
    "although a number of studies ascribe the origin of the first ( dominating ) one to l1455 irs2 and/or l1455 irs5 @xcite , others are in favor of attributing it to l1455 irs4 , which sits approximately in the center of the outflow @xcite . while there might be multiple outflows along the northwest - southeast direction , @xcite exclude l1455 irs2 and l1455 irs5 as candidate driving sources based on the evolutionary stages of the surrounding protostars .",
    "this is further supported by @xcite and nh@xmath17 imaging @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fil](a ) shows the l1455 region surveyed by @xcite with _ spitzer_. figure [ fig : fil](b ) depicts the _ herschel _ 350@xmath19 detection overlapping with our iram-30 m c@xmath0o integrated intensity map ( section [ sec : obs_iram ] ) .",
    "tracing back to _ spitzer _",
    "results , @xcite show that the l1455 cloud has a filamentary appearance with a southeast - northwest axis , coinciding with the complex dominant outflow mentioned above .",
    "since this outflow is covering several protostars on its path , the debate on its source is still unsettled .",
    "as early as @xcite , l1455 irs1 was viewed as the driving source of the second outflow in this region .",
    "recently , a survey by carma verified this , though with a slightly different outflow axis position angle @xcite .    since the _ herschel _ gould belt survey , filaments are ubiquitously observed in star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . alongside high - mass star - forming regions ,",
    "low - mass ones are no exception @xcite .",
    "recent studies , using observations with higher angular resolutions and kinematic information , further confirm the significance of filaments in such regions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed mechanisms according to which pre - stellar cores form from filaments , however , are still obscure ( e.g. , @xcite ) and , although widely seen , these hierarchical structures ( from clouds to filaments to cores ) in clustered star - forming regions remain mysterious @xcite .",
    "therefore , our goal of the present paper is to provide an in - depth study addressing star formation in a complex cloud in a filamentary environment .",
    "as alluded to in the previous paragraphs , the l1455 region possess filaments as well . in this paper , we focus on one specific protostar in this complex cloud , l1455 irs1 .",
    "it is one of the brightest protostars ( @xmath20 ) in the l1455 region @xcite . as a protostar in its early stage",
    ", it has an ambiguous classification throughout the literature . the discrimination between class 0 and class @xmath15 protostars , from an observational point of view , is non - trivial ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we follow the suggestion of @xcite , where l1455 irs1 is assigned a class @xmath21 .",
    "abundant archival data are enabling us to examine l1455 irs1 from different perspectives .",
    "dust continuum polarimetry data from scupol and tadpol are also available .",
    "the scupol legacy @xcite provides large - scale information of the magnetic field in the densest sub - region , similar in size to our iram-30 m single - dish region in l1455 . the tadpol survey using carma @xcite yields high - resolution polarization data specific to l1455 irs1 .",

    "section [ sec : ana ] details our analyses supporting the existence of a disk around l1455 irs1 .",

    "the process of combining interferometric data and single - dish data comprises several steps .",
    "the basic idea is that , we need to match the units of each data set , and generate visibilities of the single - dish data , which are then combined directly with the sma visibilities in the _ uv_-domain . in the subsequent section [ sec : test ]",
    ", we will demonstrate that this procedure yields reliable images that do not deviate much from the real sky .",
    "we follow the steps as described in @xcite .",
    "the concept is as follows :    1 .",
    "* unit conversion : * in order to generate visibilities from single - dish data , we convert brightness temperature to jy beam@xmath9 , which is the unit of the sma data .",
    "* uv samplings : * since the sma ( or any other interferometer ) does not completely cover all _ uv_-distances , and particularly not the shortest ones , it loses information on the larger - scale structures . we , therefore , want to complement this gap in _",
    "uv_-distances with single - dish data .",
    "we use the miriad tasks _ uvrandom _ and _ uvcat _ to randomly generate _ uv _ points with controlled and wanted _",
    "uv_-coverage that fill the gap of the shortest baselines .",
    "* visibilities : * the _ uv_-samplings obtained from the previous step are then modelled with the real - sky components of the single - dish data with the miriad task _",
    "uvmodel_. these components are obtained by deconvolving the single - dish beam and then multiplying it by the sma primary beam response . by the end of this step , visibilities in all _",
    "uv_-distances are generated .",
    "* slight adjustment : * before going to the final step of combination , due to the often unknown telescope efficiency ( for both single - dish and the sma ) , we have to correct the scales between the two visibility data sets ( one from single - dish , generated above ; the other from observed sma ) , to make sure that the visibilities are smoothly connected from the single - dish ( short baselines ) to the sma regime ( long baselines ) .",
    "* combination : * we now have a set of visibilities without missing flux .",
    "the usual steps of inversion , cleaning , and restoration for generating maps follow straightforwardly .",
    "we note that , in the above steps , we are forced to compromise on the angular resolution because of the addition of single - dish data .",
    "moreover , by tuning the number of points ( which we call `` weighting '' ) in step 2 when generating _ uv_-sampling points , we effectively change the final synthesized beam size .",
    "the weighting of _",
    "uv_-points of the single - dish data is chosen such that the final image cube has the best signal - to - noise ratio .        in order to check",
    "if the combination process by which we generate sma - iram - combined maps does not remove real structures nor create artificial ones , we simulate the process as described below .",
    "the idea is illustrated in figure [ fig : cbsim ] .",
    "first , we choose a map to represent the real sky .",
    "the real sky is then converted into a simulated sma and a simulated single - dish image ( denoted simulated 30 m image in figure [ fig : cbsim ] ) .",
    "after this , the two simulated images are combined through the above outlined method . to assess the quality of this combined map",
    ", we generate another simulated image , which is the ( simulated ) observed map with a synthesized beam of size equal to that of the combined map .",
    "finally , this ( simulated ) observed map is compared with the combined map .    since size and geometry of a source",
    "will generally affect what the source looks like in interferometric maps , we use the moment 0 of the combined map ( figure [ fig : m0](b ) ) as the real sky .",
    "furthermore , we are assured that the simulation does not produce non - ignorable artificial structures , which were present in @xcite because of the gap between their single - dish and the sma _ uv_-coverages . to simulate observations of the sma",
    ", we multiply the real sky by the primary beam response of the sma and convolve it with the sma synthesized beam . for the single - dish iram-30 m ,",
    "the real sky is convolved with the 30 m beam and then resampled onto the nyquist grid as the real 30 m map ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "the combination of the two subsequently gives a `` combined synthesized beam '' , which is used to simulate the observed map of the real sky ( indicated by the dashed arrow in figure [ fig : cbsim ] ) .",
    "finally , the ( simulated ) observed map is subtracted from the combined map , giving an absolute residual map ( figure [ fig : cbres](c ) ) .",
    "dividing this residual map by the observed map gives a map in unit of percentage , showing how significant the relative difference is ( figure [ fig : cbres](d ) ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : cbres ] . except for the inner most region ,",
    "the combined map is consistent with the observed map within a 1@xmath54 difference . in regions where the intensity is greater than 6@xmath54 ,",
    "we find less than 10% flux deviation .        in conclusion",
    ", the simulation assures that the combination of the sma and the iram-30 m maps is credible .",
    "we note that the best weighting for reproducing the best non - distorted image varies from case to case . since _",
    "uv_-samplings and beam sizes determine how well structures are recovered in combined maps , one should be careful when combining multiple data sets for different sources , with varying structures .",
    "we note , however , that it is impossible to perfectly reproduce the real - sky structures , due to the same reasons .",
    "we believe that a @xmath510% loss in the central region is acceptable , given that the sma usually has the same level of uncertainty in flux .                                                                                                                                          , r.  j. , teuben , p.  j. , & wright , m.  c.  h. 1995 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol .",
