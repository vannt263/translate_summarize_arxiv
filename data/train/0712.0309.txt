    "the equilibrium state of a collisionless stellar system such as an elliptical or lenticular galaxy is completely described by its distribution function ( df ) in the six - dimensional phase space of positions and velocities .",
    "the recovery of the df from observations is difficult , as for galaxies other than our own , we can usually only measure the projected surface brightness and the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) of the integrated light as a function of position on the plane of the sky .",
    "moreover , we generally do not know the intrinsic shape of the galaxy , nor the viewing direction , or the contribution to the gravitational potential provided by a super massive central black hole and/or an extended halo of dark matter . by jeans ( 1915 )",

    "it allows for an arbitrary gravitational potential , which may include contributions from dark components , integrates the equations of motion for a representative library of orbits , computes the density distribution of each orbit , and then determines the orbital weights such that the combined orbital densities reproduce the density of the system .",

    "although schwarzschild models have significantly increased our understanding of the dynamical structure and evolution of early - type galaxies , questions remain about the uniqueness and the accuracy with which they are able to recover the global parameters as well as the internal dynamics of these galaxies .",
    "many tests have been done to establish how the axisymmetric code recovers known input models , but these generally have been limited to spherical geometry or to an input axisymmetric df that is a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 only ( van der marel et al .  1998 ; cretton et al.1999 ; verolme & de zeeuw 2002 ; valluri et al.2004 ; cretton & emsellem 2004 ; thomas et al.2004 ; krajnovi et al.2005 ) .",

    "this is useful , but does not provide a fully independent test of the software .",
    "an alternative is to consider the special family of models with gravitational potential of stckel form , for which all three integrals of motion are exact and known explicitly .",
    "these separable potentials have a core rather than a central cusp , so the corresponding models can not include a central black hole , and are inadequate for describing galactic nuclei . however , they can be constructed for a large range of axis ratios ( statler 1987 ) , and their observed kinematic properties are as rich as those seen in the main body of early - type galaxies ( statler 1991 , 1994 ; arnold , de zeeuw & hunter 1994 ) .    a small number of analytic dfs have been constructed for triaxial separable models . the ` thin - orbit ' models ( hunter & de zeeuw 1992 ) have the maximum possible streaming motions , but their df contains delta functions , and they are therefore not particularly useful for a test of general - purpose numerical machinery .",
    "dejonghe & laurent ( 1991 , hereafter dl91 ) constructed separable triaxial models in which the df depends on a single parameter @xmath5 , which is a linear combination of the three exact integrals @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 admitted by these potentials , and is quadratic in the velocity components . for a given radial density profile , the df follows by simple inversion of an abel integral equation .",
    "these so - called abel models have no net mean streaming motions , and are the axisymmetric and triaxial generalisations of the well - known spherical osipkov  merritt models ( osipkov 1979 ; merritt 1985 ) , for which the observables can be calculated easily ( carollo , de zeeuw & van der marel 1995 ) .",
    "mathieu & dejonghe ( 1999 , hereafter md99 ) generalised the results of dl91 by including two families of df components with net internal mean motions around the long and the short axis , respectively , and compared the resulting models with observations of centaurus  a. although the abel character of the non - rotating components is no longer conserved , the expressions for the velocity moments in these more general models can still be evaluated in a straightforward way . when the entire df depends on the same single variable @xmath6 the famous ellipsoidal hypothesis ( e.g. , eddington 1915 ; chandrasekhar 1940 ) applies , so that self - consistency is only possible in the spherical case ( eddington 1916 ; camm 1941 ) .",
    "this does not hold for abel models with a df that is a sum of components for which the variable @xmath6 has different values of the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "such multi - component abel models can provide ( nearly ) self - consistent models with a large variety of shapes and dynamics .    here",
    ", we show that for abel models , in addition to the velocity moments , the full losvd can be calculated in a simple way .",
    "next , we construct axisymmetric and triaxial abel models to test our numerical implementation of schwarzschild s method .",
    "we assume a convenient form for the gravitational potential , and construct the df that reproduces a realistic surface brightness distribution .",
    "we compute the losvds of the models and derive two - dimensional maps of the resulting kinematics .",
    "we show that , despite the simple form of the df , these models display the large variety of features observed in early - type galaxies with integral - field spectrographs such as ` sauron `  ( emsellem et al .",

    "a similar good recovery was found by krajnovi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for the case of a two - integral df @xmath606 , which implies an isotropic velocity distribution in the meridional plane .",
    "thomas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that their independent axisymmetric numerical implementation of schwarzschild s method is similarly able to recover an analytical @xmath606 .",
    "our results show that the orbital mass weight distribution that follows from a fully three - integral df @xmath607 can be recovered as well .",
    "we have extended the abel models introduced by dl91 and generalised by md99 , and shown that , in addition to the intrinsic velocity moments , the full losvd of these models can be calculated in a straightforward way .",
    "we have then used the abel models to construct realistic axisymmetric and triaxial galaxy models to test the accuracy of schwarzschild s orbit superposition method .",
    "although abel models have separable potentials with a central core and assume a specific functional form for the ( three - integral ) df , they display a large range of shapes and their observables , which can be calculated easily , include many of the features seen in the kinematic maps of early - type galaxies .",
    "we have used an isochrone stckel potential that in the axisymmetric limit reduces to the kuzmin - kutuzov model and becomes hnon s isochrone in the spherical limit . because of the simple form of the isochrone potential , the resulting abel models are ideally suited to test numerical implementations of the schwarzschild orbit superposition method .",
    "the calculation of @xmath608 , needed when comparing the orbital mass weight distribution of the schwarzschild models with the three - integral df of the abel models , simplifies significantly for this case .",
    "integral - field observations in principle provide the losvd as a function of position on the sky , so that it is a function @xmath609 that depends on three variables .",
    "the oblate axisymmetric and triaxial galaxy models we have constructed , have a df which is a sum of abel components @xmath610 with different values of the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 , so that the df is a function of three variables as well , namely the integrals of motion @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "we have shown that the simulated integral - field observables of these models are matched in detail by the best - fit schwarzschild model .",
    "this does not automatically imply that the intrinsic velocity moments and the three - integral df  which are not directly fitted  are also correctly recovered .",
    "first consider three - integral oblate models , i.e. , with a df that is a function @xmath607 . in the special case",
    "that a galaxy happens to be well approximated by a two - integral df @xmath611 , the density @xmath612 uniquely determines the even part of @xmath606 and the mean streaming @xmath613 in the meridional plane fixes the part of @xmath606 that is odd in @xmath1 ( dejonghe 1986 ) .",
    "ignoring non - uniqueness in the deprojection of the surface density @xmath162 ( rybicki 1987 ) and the mean streaming motion @xmath151 on the plane of the sky , these two quantities define a two - integral df completely .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion and higher - order velocity moments of the losvd then provide additional information , which for example can be used to constrain the inclination ( e.g. , cappellari et al .",
    "however , the reliability of the derived inclination , of course , depends on the correctness of the assumption of a two - integral df . in the more realistic case of a three - integral df @xmath607 ,",
    "such a one - to - one relation with ( the velocity moments of ) the observed losvd @xmath609 has not been established .",
    "nevertheless , we showed that , given integral - field observations of the velocity moments of the losvd ( up to @xmath154 ) , recovery of the full three - integral df is possible with schwarzschild s method , for the correct inclination and mass - to - light ratio .    in the triaxial case ,",
    "the df is again a function of three integrals of motion , but the orbital structure in these models is substantially richer than in the oblate axisymmetric models , with four major orbit families , instead of only one .",
    "this introduces a fundamental non - uniqueness in the recovery of the df .",
    "whereas in the oblate axisymmetric case @xmath612 uniquely defines the even part of @xmath606 , in the ( separable ) triaxial case the density @xmath614 does _ not _ uniquely determine the even part of @xmath44 , although both of these are functions of three variables ( hunter & de zeeuw 1992 ) .",
    "it is ( yet ) unknown how much specification of @xmath609 can narrow down the range of possible dfs further , even ignoring the non - uniqueness caused by the required deprojection of the surface brightness .",
    "our results show that schwarzschild s method recovers the correct orbital mass weight distribution associated to @xmath44 .",
    "given the very large freedom in the orbit choice for this case , the modest resolution of our orbit library , and the resulting approximations in the evaluation of the phase space volume , the agreement between the orbital mass weights found in ",
    "[ sec : intdftriax ] is in fact remarkable . it may be possible to improve the df recovery further by refining the sampling of the orbits and the regularisation of the orbital mass weights .",
    "our analysis shows that it is clear that abel models are useful for testing orbit - based modelling methods such as schwarzschild s method .",
    "in particular the oblate limiting case with a kuzmin - kutuzov potential (   [ sec : recoveryaxi ] ) provides a new and convenient test for existing axisymmetric schwarzschild codes .",
    "furthermore , because abel models with a few df components can already provide quite a good representation of observed early - type galaxies , they can be used as a way to ( numerically ) build three - integral dynamical models of these galaxies ( see e.g. md96 for an application to centaurus  a ) .",
    "we conclude that schwarzschild s method is able to recover the internal dynamical structure of realistic models of early - type galaxies .",
    "we show in vdb07 that schwarzschild s method also allows for an accurate determination of the mass - to - light ratio and provides significant constraints on the viewing direction and intrinsic shape .",
    "the axisymmetric schwarzschild method has already been successfully applied by us and other groups to determine the black hole mass , mass - to - light ratio ( profile ) , dark matter profile as well as the ( three - integral ) df of early - type galaxies . with our extension to triaxial geometry , described in detail in vdb07",
    ", we are now able to model early - type galaxies  in particular the giant ellipticals  which show clear signatures of non - axisymmetry , including isophote twist , kinematic misalignment and kinematic decoupled components .",
    "moreover , since triaxial galaxies may appear axisymmetric ( or even spherical ) in projection , we can investigate the effect of intrinsic triaxiality on the measurements of e.g.  black hole masses based on axisymmetric model fits to observations of galaxies .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
