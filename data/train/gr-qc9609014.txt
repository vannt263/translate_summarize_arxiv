    "binary neutron star systems which are spiraling toward their final coalescence under the dissipative influence of gravitational radiation reaction forces are the primary targets for detection of gravitational waves by interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as ligo and virgo@xcite .",
    "extracting the gravitational waves from the detector noise and making use of the information encoded in the signals will require a thorough knowledge of the expected waveforms produced by these binaries@xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the effect of the neutron - star equation of state on the orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission of binaries just prior to merging .",
    "specifically , we show that a combination of post - newtonian ( relativistic ) effects and newtonian tidal effects ( which depend on the equation of state ) conspire to induce a dynamical instability in the orbital motion , which causes the plunge to final coalescence to begin somewhat sooner  and to proceed somewhat faster  than it would simply under the influence of the dissipative radiation reaction force .",
    "thus the motion of the bodies during the late stages of binary inspiral depends on the structure of the neutron stars .",
    "consequently , the gravitational waveform emitted during this short portion of the final coalescence will be imprinted with information about the nuclear equation of state .    during the final @xmath2 minutes or the last @xmath3 orbits of a neutron star binary inspiral , the orbital frequency increases from about 5 hz on up to a cutoff of a few hundreds to a thousand hertz ( roughly corresponding to the orbital frequency when the final plunge begins ) .",
    "thus the gravitational wave frequency ( twice the orbital frequency for the dominant quadrupole radiation ) _ chirps _ through the ligo detector bandwidth during this period @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the binary in these last few minutes of the inspiral is very sensitive to a number of relativistic effects , such as gravitational - wave tails and spin - orbit coupling ( dragging of inertial frames ) .",
    "the gravitational waveform emitted by the binary in this portion of the coalescence , the adiabatic inspiral , is currently being extensively studied @xcite . during most of this inspiral phase",
    "the neutron stars can be treated as simple point masses because the effects associated with the finite stellar size turn out to be small : ( i ) the neutron star has too small a viscosity to allow for angular momentum transfer from the orbit to the stellar spin via viscous tidal torque@xcite ; ( ii ) the effect of the spin - induced quadrupole is negligible unless the neutron star has rotation rate close to the break - up limit@xcite ; ( iii ) resonant excitations of neutron star internal modes ( which occur at orbital frequencies less than @xmath4 hz ) produce only a small change in the orbital phase due to the weak coupling between the modes and the tidal potential@xcite ; ( iv ) the correction to the equation of motion from the ( static ) tidal interaction is of order @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the neutron star radius , @xmath7 is the orbital separation@xcite ) , which is negligible except when @xmath7 is smaller than a few stellar radii . since @xmath8 for a typical neutron star of mass @xmath9 and radius @xmath10 km , the tidal effect is essentially a ( post)@xmath11-newtonian correction @xcite .",
    "the expression for the phase error induced by the tidal effect is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the fact that the evolution of the binary system as it sweeps through the low frequency band of the detector is insensitive to finite - size effects means that the measurement of the inspiral waveform will allow us to probe cleanly into the intricate structure of general relativity , and to test whether general relativity is the correct theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "moreover , some of the parameters of the binary system , such as the masses of the stars , can be determined with reasonable accuracy@xcite .",
    "however , the waveform s lack of dependence on the finite size of the objects during the most of the adiabatic inspiral also implies that information about the internal structure of the neutron star is only imprinted on the radiation emitted just prior to coalescence when the orbital radius is small .",
    "indeed at small orbital separations , tidal effects are expected to be very important . in a purely _ newtonian _ analysis , the interaction potential between star @xmath12 and the tide - induced quadrupole of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , increases with decreasing @xmath7 .",
    "the potential becomes so steep that a dynamical instability develops , accelerating the coalescence at small orbital radius .",
    "this newtonian instability has been fully explored using semi - analytic models in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite ( hereafter referred to as ls ) .",
    "it has also been examined numerically in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , a purely newtonian treatment of the binary at small separation is clearly not adequate , as general relativistic effects will also be important in this regime ; and general relativistic effects can also make the orbit unstable .",
    "for example , a test particle in circular orbit around a schwarzschild black hole will experience an `` innermost stable circular orbit '' at @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 in harmonic coordinates ) .",
    "this unstable behavior is caused by higher - order relativistic corrections included in the schwarzschild geodesic equations of motion .",
    "for computing the orbital evolution of two neutron stars of comparable mass near coalescence , the test - mass limit is obviously inadequate . in order to explore the orbital instability for such systems , kidder ,",
    "will and wiseman @xcite ( hereafter referred as kww ) developed _ hybrid _ equations of motion . these equations",
    "augment the the schwarzschild geodesic equations of motion with the finite - mass terms of the ( post)@xmath17-newtonian equations of motion . including these finite mass terms in the equation of motion moved the innermost - stable - circular - orbit radius farther out ( in units of the total mass ) . in this paper , we augment the hybrid equations with contributions due to the tidal deformation of the stars . in a nutshell , the work presented here combines the newtonian tidal analysis of ls @xcite with the relativistic point - mass analysis of kww @xcite to yield a more complete picture of the neutron - star coalescence prior to merging .",
    "we note , that unlike a test - particle around a schwarzschild black hole , the very notion of `` innermost stable circular orbit '' is poorly defined for objects of comparable mass .",
    "after all , in the relativistic regime the binary orbit will be decaying rapidly due to radiation reaction ; thus the orbit is not circular , but rather a decaying spiral . in order to give a semi - quantitative definition of `` innermost stable circular orbit '' we use the artifice of `` shutting off '' all the dissipative terms in the equation of motion and looking for the point where the solutions of the remaining non - dissipative equations become dynamically unstable .",
    "the use of hybrid equations of motion augmented with the tidal terms allows us to map out the dependence of the critical radius @xmath18 , or the corresponding orbital frequency @xmath19 , for a wide range of allowed neutron star equations of state ( parametrized by radius and effective polytropic index ; see figure 1 ) .",
    "we believe that clearing up such dependence is important , and this analysis provides a benchmark with which comparisons can be made with future numerical results .",
    "_ indeed , an important point we wish to make in this paper is that neither relativistic ( post newtonian ) effects nor newtonian tidal effects can be neglected near the instability limit , and the critical frequency can be much lower than the value obtained when only one of these effects are included . _",
    "the main results of our analysis are summarized in figure 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 2 shows that the rate of radial infall for stars near coalescence is substantially underestimated if one models the coalescence as a newtonian circular - orbit decaying solely under the influence of radiation reaction ( top dotted curve ) . in other words , the rate of coordinate infall is substantially enhanced by the non - dissipative terms .",
    "somewhat more relevant for observational purposes , figure 3 shows that the number of orbits ( or gravitational wave cycles ) per logarithmic frequency interval is substantially reduced by the unstable collapse of the orbit .",
    "both plots show modest sensitivity to the equation of state .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present our equations of motion . in section iii",
    "we examine the orbital stability using the non - dissipative portion of the equations of motion , and thus identify the location of the `` innermost stable circular orbit '' . in section",
    "iv we include the dissipative terms that were omitted in the analysis of section iii , and evolve the full equations of motion . in section",
    "v we briefly discuss the relevance of our results to numerical hydrodynamic calculations and to gravitational wave signal analysis .",
    "consider a binary containing two neutron stars of mass @xmath13 and @xmath12 , each obeying a polytropic equation of state @xmath20 .",
    "we use the compressible ellipsoid model for binary stars developed in ls@xcite . basically , we model the tidally deformed neutron star as an ellipsoid , with internal density profile similar to that of a spherical polytrope .",
    "the dynamics of such a neutron star ( so called riemann - s ellipsoid ) is characterized by the three principal axes ( @xmath21 for star @xmath13 and @xmath22 for star @xmath12 ) , the angular velocity ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) of the ellipsoidal figure about a principal axis ( perpendicular to the orbital plane ) and the internal motion of the fluid with uniform vorticity .",
    "the non - zero internal fluid motion is necessary because the binary neutron stars are not expected to corotate with the orbit due to rapid orbital decay and small viscosity@xcite .",
    "although the newtonian tidal interaction between the neutron stars can be treated exactly in the linear regime using mode decomposition@xcite , the ellipsoid model has the advantage that it can be extended to the nonlinear regime at small orbital radii , when the tidal deformation of the star becomes significant .",
    "the newtonian dynamical equations for the binary neutron stars as derived in ls include the familiar newtonian ( @xmath25 ) force - law for point - masses orbiting one another ; they further contain newtonian terms involving finite size ( tidal ) effects . a post - newtonian treatment of the tidal problem would give the relativistic corrections to these terms , namely the standard point - mass , post - newtonian corrections to the equations of motion , as well as relativistic corrections to the quadrupole moment and corrections due to higher moments the bodies .",
    "( see appendix f of @xcite . )",
    "to insure that our equations of motion at least agree with the known post - newtonian , point - mass equations we augment these newtonian equations of motion with the hybrid equations of kww .",
    "however , we use only the newtonian equations to describe the evolution of the neutron stars structure ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and the fluid motion ( the figure rotation rate and the internal vorticity ) within the stars .",
    "these are given by eqs .",
    "( 2.18)-(2.22 ) of ls .",
    "in other words , we neglect the relativistic corrections to the fluid motion , self - gravity and tidal interaction . these corrections are secondary effects and should not modify the _ orbital dynamics _",
    "appreciably ( e.g. , the newtonian tidal interaction between the two stars scales approximately as @xmath28 , and its relativistic correction is of order @xmath29 smaller ) . as noted",
    "before , the tidal interaction enters the newtonian potential as a correction of @xmath30\\sim o[(m_t / r)^5]$ ] , in effect , as a ( post)@xmath11-newtonian term .",
    "therefore , by not including relativistic corrections to these tidal terms , we are merely omiting terms which are of ( post)@xmath31-newtonian order .",
    "in fact , the largest error comes from neglecting the post - newtonian correction ( of order @xmath1 ) to the internal stellar structure ( see sec .",
    "iii.b for an estimate of its effect on @xmath19 ) .",
    "the relativistic corrections to the orbital motion , however , are very important . our equations of orbital motion can be assembled from eqs .",

    "see ref.@xcite . ] . we conclude that to neglect either the tidal effects or the relativistic effects can lead to large error in the estimated critical frequency .    except for the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the hybrid equations of motion@xcite , the main uncertainty in our determination of @xmath19 comes from neglecting post - newtonian corrections to ( i ) the stellar structure and ( ii ) the the tidal potential .",

    "thus the change in @xmath19 due to these two effects is @xmath80 , i.e. , the critical frequency increases by a few percent@xcite .    as emphasized in sec .",
    "i , the critical radius ( or critical frequency ) , at which the non - dissipative equations become dynamically unstable , is meaningful only in the sense that when @xmath56 , the binary will coalesce on dynamical ( orbital ) timescale even in the absence of dissipation . in the realistic situation , the dissipative radiation reaction forces",
    "will also be rapidly driving the binary to coalescence . therefore to determine the significance of the dynamical instability we must compute the orbital evolution with the full equations of motion  including the radiation reaction .",
    "we now include the dissipative radiation reaction forces in our analysis . in this case",
    "the plunge will be driven by both the dissipative , as well as the non - dissipative effects associated with the steepening potential ( both the tidal potential and the relativistic potential ) .",
    "but what effect is dominant ? in order to numerically investigate this question , we choose a specific system with @xmath81 , @xmath63 and @xmath67 .",

    "( ii ) a purely relativistic plunge in which we neglect the tidal effects [ specifically we set @xmath85 in eqs .  ( 1)-(2 ) ] .",
    "this relativistic case is depicted by the long - dashed curve in figure 2 and 3 .",
    "( iii ) a tidally enhanced plunge : we include only the newtonian terms in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(2 ) and the radiation reaction force .",
    "[ specifically we set @xmath83 and @xmath86 in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(2 ) . ]",
    "this case is depicted by the short - dashed curve in figure 2 and 3 .",
    "( iv ) finally , we evolve the complete dynamical equations including all terms in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(2 ) ; this is depicted by the solid curve in figure 2 and 3 .",
    "each intergration is terminated when the surfaces of the stars touch , i.e. , at @xmath87 ( for the point - mass problem , the calculation is terminated at @xmath88 ) .    in figure 2",
    "we clearly see that the non - dissipative effects  tidal and relativistic  substantially increase the rate of infall .",
    "the radial velocity at binary contact is comparable to the tangential velocity .",
    "we also note that the radial coordinate velocity is a gauge dependent quantity ; therefore our only intent in using it in figure 2 is to convey the general trend that the rate of infall is enhanced by the dynamical instability .",
    "figure 3 shows the number of orbits the binary spends per logarithmic frequency . in the simplest point - mass , newtonian - plus - radiation - reaction case [ case ( i ) above ]",
    ", the result can be calculated analytically @xmath89 which gives @xmath90 cycles at @xmath91 hz .",
    "in contrast , the tidal and relativistic effects reduce this number to less than @xmath92 .",

    "the newtonian plus radiation reaction result is @xmath95 .",
    "we see that the radiation power near contact becomes much smaller .",
    "note that @xmath96 calcuated in this way is not exactly the energy power spectrum , which must be obtained from the fourier transform of the waveform@xcite ; however , it does provide a semi - quantitative feature of the full analysis ; in particular , the dip in the @xmath96 curve around @xmath97 hz results from the dynamical instability of the orbit ( see also refs.@xcite , although the calculations presented there are purely newtonian ) .",
    "a number of authors have tried to define and locate the innermost stable circular orbit for relativistic coalescing systems of comparable masses @xcite in order to characterize the final moments of a binary coalescence ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "the results of the various analyses are not converging to an agreed answer .",
    "obviously , the precise nature of the final coalescence of two neutron stars will only be determined by a numerical simulation using full general - relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "however , the present analysis does point to two intersting features to look for in a full numerical treatment : ( i ) to get even a qualitative picture of the coalescence , it is necessary to begin the numerical evolution when the stars are still well separated , _",
    "i.e. _ before the onset of the orbital dynamical instability .",
    "the instability  the plunge  causes the coalescence to proceed much more swiftly than a coalescence driven solely by radiation reaction ; thus the actual coalescence may differ qualitatively from one computed with a simple radiation - reaction driven inspiral .",
    "the final coalescence may be more of a splat , than the slow winding together of the stars@xcite .",
    "( ii ) the instability results from both the tidal effects and the relativistic corrections in the equations of motion .",
    "kww showed that there is no instability in the _ first _ post - newtonian relativistic equations of motion ; the instability does not show up until at least second post - newtonian order .",
    "therefore , in order for numerical simulations to see the effects of the relativistic unstable plunge , it will probably require the use of at least second - order , post - newtonian hydrodynamic code .",
    "kww also showed that the location of the dynamic instability does not converge very rapidly as one increases the post - newtonian order of the approximation .",
    "[ this fact led kww to the introduce the hybrid equations of motion . ]",
    "thus , to get even a qualitatively accurate evolution of the binary near coalescence , it may be necessary to use a full general relativistic hydrodynamic treatment of the coalescence problem , and begin the evolution when the stars are still well separated .",
    "as we have shown , the dynamical instability in the equation of motion will , in effect , cut off the chirping waveform .",
    "the frequency of the cut - off is somewhat dependent on the neutron star equation of state . only in this late stage of the evolution",
    "does the equation of state leave a tell - tale sign in the emitted waveform .",
    "however , devising a strategy to dig this information from the detector output requires further consideration .",
    "most detection / measurement strategies for coalescing binaries involve integrating template waveforms against long stretches ( 8000 orbits ! ) of raw output data , the idea being that one can detect / measure a relatively low amplitude signal by integrating for a long time .",
    "looking for the signature of this very late stage plunge is precisely the opposite : we are looking at the waveform just before coalescence when the amplitude is fairly strong , but the plunge is of fairly short in duration .",
    "so answering questions about the plunge ( such as , at what orbital frequency did it begin ? ) requires measuring a relatively large amplitude , but short - duration , effect .",
    "clearly , analysis of such events will require a different detection strategy@xcite .",

    "assigning such a high `` post - newtonian '' relativistic order to this `` newtonian '' tidal effect may seem strange , but the argument goes as follows : the quadrupole correction enters the the newtonian potential as @xmath98 $ ] , here the leading term is just the usual @xmath99-part of the newtonian potential , @xmath100 is some measure of the bodies quadrupole moment , @xmath101 is the second legendre polynomial .",
