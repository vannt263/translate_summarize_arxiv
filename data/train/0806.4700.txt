    "one of the most renowned features of the exchange bias ( eb ) effect , which results from the exchange coupling between ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) layers , is a shift of the hysteresis loop away from zero field .",
    "it is associated with a frozen - in unidirectional anisotropy , induced , e.g. by cooling of the eb system through the nel temperature in an applied magnetic field . due to the intriguing properties underlying the eb phenomenon and its relevance for magnetic recording applications it is under persistent study since the seminal paper by meiklejohn and bean in 1956",

    "the interplay between these anisotropies is crucial for domain formation and remagnetization processes in nanostructures  @xcite .",
    "while vortex formation sometimes is observed in the f layer of exchange biased nanostructures  @xcite , the unidirectional anisotropy may also lead to a collapse of the vortex state that occurs in the same f nanostructure without being in contact to an antiferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "an obvious question is whether the opposite is also possible : vortex formation in the eb system , but no vortex nucleation in the corresponding unbiased f island .    in this paper , we investigate nio / ni eb systems .",
    "we analyze the magnetic behavior of a continuous nio / ni bilayer film and of nio / ni square islands of different sizes , both with ( eb case ) and without ( non - eb case ) the existence of unidirectional anisotropy . for the patterned samples , we see vortexlike hysteresis loops in the eb case , whereas in the non - eb case several features of a vortex hysteresis loop are missing .",
    "micromagnetic simulations show that the eb field can cause a vortexlike state that is not observed for the same f microstructure .",
    "the nio / ni samples were fabricated by uhv ion beam sputter deposition and subsequent plasma oxidation .",
    "after heating the mgo(001 ) substrate to 800  @xmath1c for cleaning its surface , ni was deposited at a substrate temperature of 100  @xmath1c with a sputter rate of 0.03 nm / s .",

    "test experiments with other oxidation methods showed that plasma oxidation appears to be the only method to obtain exchange biased films by means of oxidizing a ni layer , probably because a minimum film thickness of the af layer is required for nonzero eb fields .",

    "if there were frozen - in spins from the previous field - cooling procedure ( at the starting angle ) , then the hysteresis loops are expected to differ , indicating that the blocking temperature was above 400  k. however , in the experiment , we observed identical hysteresis loops at different angles . therefore , we conclude that in our nio / ni samples the blocking temperature is below 400  k.    accordingly , the hysteresis loop of the continuous nio / ni film was measured at 10  k after field cooling from 400  k in a field of 0.3  t. the field was applied along the easy axis and its value exceeded the saturation magnetization . in fig .",

    "the shape of the hysteresis loop at 400  k changed remarkably compared to the continuous nio / ni film and clearly indicates a domain state at remanence .",
    "moreover , the magnetic hysteresis loops at 10k ( solid lines ) show considerable divergence of the shape , coercivity and eb field magnitude from the corresponding data for the continuous nio / ni film .",
    "it is also noticeable that in the eb case all hysteresis loops of the patterned samples show kinks in each branch before reaching saturation and exhibit an asymmetric shape .",
    "however , the shape of the hysteresis loops measured in the non - eb case is symmetric and no kinks are visible .",
    "altogether , the hysteresis loops indicate that in the eb case the square microstructures have a domain configuration similar to a vortex state . in the non - eb case a different remagnetization process",
    "is observed , although it should be noted that the loop is slightly more narrow close to remanence than for higher fields .",
    "another remarkable feature is the behavior of the eb fields given in table  [ tablenionieb ] . for the squares with 0.5 and 3.0  @xmath0 m edge lengths ,",
    "the eb field is reduced to -1.25 and -0.75  mt , respectively .",

    "this positive eb was observed for several samples with squares of 1.5  @xmath0 m edge size , so that we can exclude individual structural and lithographical properties of the sample .",

    "the eb field was simulated with locally pinned af spins distributed randomly across 10% of the area  @xcite .",
    "the hysteresis loop obtained from the micromagnetic model when the field is applied along the edge of the structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ simulation](a ) .",
    "the inset shows the simulation result for the non - eb case , where no pinned af spins are assumed .",
    "it is symmetric and no vortex state occurs .",
    "the more rounded experimental hysteresis loop is most likely due to the sequential switching of individual dots with a distribution of coercive fields . in the eb case",
    ", the hysteresis loop has a characteristic shape resembling the experimental data from fig .",
    "[ nioni_patterned ] . in particular , the narrowing close to the coercive fields and the kinks in the ascending and descending branches of the hysteresis loops are properly reproduced .",
    "however , compared to the experimental data , the loop shows a pronounced eb field @xmath10 , and the remagnetization process occurs within a rather small field range .",
    "as previously shown , we attribute this deviation to the spin - glass behavior of the interface between the f and the af layer .",
    "it implies that some of the spins at the interface are frozen in and contribute to the eb shift , while others reverse concurrently with the f layer , as soft x - ray resonant magnetic scattering ( xrms ) experiments documented  @xcite .",
    "if the latter behavior of the interface spins is taken into account , the hysteresis loop of the eb system broadens and the eb field is reduced , as shown by numerical calculations  @xcite . for the micromagnetic model employed in this paper ,",

    "the kinks emerge due to the collapse of the vortexlike states and the formation of a 360@xmath1 domain wall across the square structure [ fig .",
    "[ simulation](b ) ] .    in the simulation",
    "we could also see that vortexlike hysteresis loops only arise if a certain balance between the values of the eb field and the shape anisotropy energy exists . by varying either the unidirectional anisotropy strength or the structure size in the set of simulation parameters",
    ", we obtained hysteresis loops , which resemble all of those displayed in fig .",
    "[ nioni_patterned ] , apart from an overall shift along the field axis .",
    "we observed hysteresis loops with kinks located symmetrical to the hysteresis s center , but at different field values .",
    "moreover , the positions of the kinks can move such that the upper and the lower kink are encountered at fields asymmetrical to the center of the hysteresis .",
    "this might explain the appearance of a positive eb field , being due to a kink forming in the ascending hysteresis branch at the coercive field , but at a different field in the descending branch .",
    "however , in the simulation , these features show only a qualitative agreement with the hysteresis loops shown in fig .",
    "[ nioni_patterned ] . in particular , the varying eb field leads to a nonconstant shift of the hysteresis loop .",
    "as before , we attribute these deviations to spin disorder at the nio / ni interface .",
    "for the continuous nio / ni film , the shape of the first hysteresis loop ( virgin state ) is typical of a reversal through nucleation of domain walls and domain wall motion .",
    "the second and subsequent reversals indicate that a reversal through rotation of magnetization occurs . for coo / co eb systems ,",
    "the asymmetric shape of the first hysteresis loop has been observed before in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , where the formation of magnetic domains at the interface subsequent to the first magnetization reversal was reported . in theoretical studies , this training effect was related to irreversible changes taking place during the first reversal at the f / af interface and in the af layer  @xcite .",
    "a more thorough review of the training effect within eb models is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , including the spin - glass model of eb , which is able to explain many of the observed experimental features associated with the training effect of eb in continuous bilayers .",
    "the hysteresis loops in the eb case differ considerably from those in the non - eb case .",
    "after the field - cooling procedure , the hysteresis loops exhibit kinks before reaching saturation and the eb field is reduced .",
    "this tightening of the hysteresis at coercivity is a feature reminiscent of a vortex state  @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to vortex states in circular islands , the squares appear not to have a well defined nucleation field .    modified magnetization reversal processes for eb patterns , as compared to continuous exchange biased films , were previously reported .",
    "e.g. , eisenmenger et al .",
    "@xcite reported on strongly asymmetrically shaped hysteresis loops of exchange biased fe / fef@xmath11 circular nanostructures . in a study by li et al .",
    "@xcite a vortex state within exchange biased fe / fef@xmath11 nanostructures was identified by combined squid investigations and micromagnetic simulations .",
    "the hysteresis loops above the nel temperature resemble those in the eb case strongly .",
    "kato et al .",
    "@xcite imaged square mnir(20 nm)/nife(20 nm ) and nife(20 nm ) nanostructures with mfm that exhibit closure domains . but",
    "closure domains for the mnir / nife structures were only found when the corresponding nife element also showed a closure domain .",
    "this is consistent with the intuitive argument that an additional contribution from unidirectional anisotropy should destroy the highly symmetrical vortex state .",
    "however , this argument does not hold for the patterned samples studied here .",
    "both in the micromagnetic simulation and in the experimental data the vortex states are only present in the eb case but not in the non - eb case .",
    "thus , the change in the magnetization reversal including the kinks in the hysteresis loops must be due to the additional energy contribution from unidirectional anisotropy . as can be seen from the micromagnetic simulation , the local eb acts as a nucleation center for several vortices within the squares with 0.5  @xmath0 m edge length .",
    "a similar behavior is expected for the other patterned samples . moreover , from the numerical calculations , it becomes evident that the balance between shape and unidirectional anisotropy is crucial for the position of the kinks .",
    "this is consistent with the observation for the square islands with 1.5  @xmath0 m edge length , where the kinks are not symmetrical to the center of the hysteresis .",
    "additionally to the effects on the shape , the eb field pushes the whole vortexlike hysteresis loop to the negative side of the field axis , acting similarly as in a continuous film .",
    "thereby , the kinks are not encountered at positions equally distant to zero field any more .",
    "related to the remagnetization behavior is the positive eb field found for the nio / ni islands with 1.5 @xmath0 m edge length .",
    "a positive eb has been seen before in continuous films and is usually attributed to uncompensated frozen - in spins in the af layer , which align parallel to the field direction in high enough external fields . for eb islands , a positive shift should rather be related to the shape change in the hysteresis . with a variation of the size of the patterns , the shape anisotropy also changes . as a result of the interplay between shape and unidirectional anisotropy , the hysteresis loop is then different in shape . especially if the kinks are encountered at positions not symmetrical to the center of the hysteresis , as is the case for the islands with 1.5 @xmath0 m edge length ,",
    "the coercive fields are affected .",
    "considering that on the length scale discussed the unidirectional anisotropy strength should remain constant , as discussed below , the shape anisotropy should therefore cause the positive eb .",
    "consequently , with the magnetization reversal being determined by shape anisotropy , it is misleading to use the classical formula for the eb field and relate it to the unidirectional anisotropy energy in the system  @xcite . in the classical eb formula @xmath12",
    "only the coercive fields of the ascending and descending branches @xmath13 and @xmath14 are considered .",
    "we propose to use the field position of the kinks to describe possible shifts of the hysteresis .",
    "this appears to be a more appropriate procedure to determine the unidirectional anisotropy energy , since the kinks of a typical vortex hysteresis loop have equal distance to the center of the hysteresis .",
    "although multivortex states develop in the samples , which leads to deviations from hysteresis loops typical of a single vortex state , this procedure results in an almost constant eb field , as shown in table  [ tablekinks ] .",
    "the values for the eb field in the table were determined by averaging the field axis values of the left and right kinks .",
    "furthermore , the value of the eb field for the continuous film determined by the classical eb formula is comparable to the eb fields for the patterned samples as obtained by averaging over the positions of the kinks .",
    "this indicates that the unidirectional anisotropy energy is constant for the different samples , which is in agreement with the fact that the af domain size in the system studied should be rather small  @xcite .",
    "thus , the local eb at the f / af interface is not affected by the patterning process down to 0.5 @xmath0 m and the unidirectional anisotropy energy remains constant for all the samples .",
    "however , the combination of local eb and shape anisotropy has a dramatic effect on the shape of the hysteresis in nio / ni microstructures .",
    "we investigated the eb effect in nio / ni micro- and submicrostructures . due to the interplay between shape and unidirectional anisotropy",
    "several interesting effects arise . first , vortex formation is more distinctive in the exchange biased square islands than in the corresponding unbiased f islands .",
    "second , the shape of the whole hysteresis is affected by a combination of unidirectional anisotropy and shape anisotropy .",
    "third , as a consequence , the classical formula for the eb field is not appropriate for the description of eb in structures containing a vortex state .",
    "misleading positive eb fields may result from this . a modified procedure for evaluating the eb field",
    "is proposed , which takes the change of the shape into account .",
