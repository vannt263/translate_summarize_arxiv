    "in the study of superconductivity , the observation of knight shift by nmr experiments is an important method to identify the pairing symmetry .",
    "the knight shift is related to the paramagnetic susceptibility , and it is suppressed below the superconducting transition temperature , if the superconductivity is the spin - singlet pairing .",
    "@xcite at a zero field , the temperature ( @xmath2 ) dependence of the knight shift is described by the yosida function .",
    "@xcite it shows either an exponential @xmath2-dependence at low @xmath2 in the @xmath0-wave superconductors with the full gap , or a power - law @xmath2-dependence in anisotropic superconductors with nodes . on the other hand ,",
    "the paramagnetic susceptibility @xmath3 is proportional to the electronic specific heat at low @xmath2 , since both quantities are proportional to zero - energy density of states ( dos ) . in the @xmath0-wave pairing",
    ", we expect the linear @xmath4-dependence of @xmath3 at low @xmath4 and low @xmath2 region .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath1-wave pairing with line nodes , we expect the relation @xmath5 due to the volovik effect .",
    "@xcite therefore , by the careful observations of the @xmath2- and @xmath4-dependence of the knight shift , we may obtain valuable information to identify the pairing symmetry of the superconductivity .",
    "however , the nmr experiment to detect the knight shift is usually performed in the vortex states under static magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , in order to correctly analyze the knight shift , we have to evaluate properties of the resonance line shape of the nmr spectrum considering the non - uniform spatial structure of paramagnetic moments in the vortex states .    in the nmr experiment ,",
    "the spectrum of the nuclear spin resonance is determined by the internal magnetic field and the hyperfine coupling to the spin of the conduction electrons .",
    "therefore , in a simple consideration , the effective field for the nuclear spin is given by @xmath6 ,  @xcite where @xmath7 is the internal field distribution , @xmath8 is the paramagnetic moment of conduction electrons , and @xmath9 is a hyperfine coupling constant depending on species of the nuclear spins . the resonance line shape of nmr is given by @xmath10 i.e. , the intensity at each resonance frequency @xmath11 comes from the volume satisfying @xmath12 in a unit cell .",
    "when the contribution of the hyperfine coupling is dominant , the nmr signal selectively detects @xmath8 .",
    "this is the experiment observing the knight shift .",
    "as the resonance line shape of the nmr spectrum for the knight shift , we calculate the distribution function @xmath13 from the spatial structure of @xmath8 . on the other hand , in the case of negligible hyperfine coupling , the nmr signal is determined by @xmath7 .",
    "this resonance line shape in the vortex lattice state is called `` redfield pattern '' .",
    "@xcite the resonance line shape is given by the distribution function @xmath14 calculated from the internal field @xmath7 .",
    "since the hyperfine coupling constant has different values for different nuclei , whether we observe the redfield pattern of @xmath15 or the knight shift spectrum of @xmath16 depends on the target nuclei in the nmr experiment , even in same superconductors .",
    "the distributions of @xmath16 and @xmath15 were sometimes confused in analysis of the nmr resonance line shape in the vortex states .",
    "thus , it is important to clarify differences of the behaviors between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to calculate the knight shift spectrum @xmath16 and the redfield pattern @xmath15 in the vortex lattice state on the basis of eilenberger theory ,  @xcite and discuss differences between them .",
    "we quantitatively estimate the @xmath2-dependence and the @xmath4-dependence of the knight shift spectrum .",
    "we discuss their behaviors depending on the pairing symmetries , i.e. , @xmath0-wave pairing and @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "in addition to the clean limit , we study the influence of the impurity scatterings in the born limit and the unitary limit , where the residual dos appears in the superconducting state.@xcite we discuss how the impurity scattering changes the nmr resonance line shape .",
