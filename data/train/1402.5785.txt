    "raman measurements were performed using a 488 nm @xmath9 laser line for excitation and a triple - grating spectrometer ( princeton instruments trivista 555 ) with a liquid - nitrogen cooled ccd detector . for measurements in the temperature range 80 - 300k",
    "a micro - raman setup was used : the samples were placed inside a cryostage ( linkam thms600 ) and a 50x objective of a olympus bx51 microscope was used to focus the laser and collect the raman signal .",
    "the laser spot on the sample inside the cryostage was less than @xmath10 in diameter . for measurements in the 10 - 300 k range",

    "single crystals of cos@xmath0 were grown in the ames laboratory according to the chemical vapor transport procedure used by wang et al .",

    "at the same time , the width of the @xmath1 peak experiences a drastic change with increased power , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the abnormal behavior of the width of the @xmath1 peak ( its width increasing with decreasing temperature ) is probably closely related to the factors , which define the smearing out of the phase transition .",

    "before proceeding to the discussion let s shortly summarize the main findings of the current paper .",
    "all five raman active modes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) were observed in single crystals of the itinerant ferromagnet cos@xmath0 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the frequencies and linewidths of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , modes in the paramagnetic phase can be described in the framework of the klemens approach  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . in the ferromagnetic phase ,",
    "the @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 modes reveal distinct hardening on cooling as is seen in fig .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath1 mode indicates a smearing out of the phase transition at high excitation power ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) that possibly arises from a temperature gradient in the sample .",
    "the linewidths of @xmath4 and @xmath1 modes behave in an expected way at low laser excitation power ( decrease with decreasing temperature ) in the ferromagnetic phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ,  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "but at high laser excitation power the corresponding linewidths increase with a decrease in temperature below @xmath8 .",
    "but then , as can be seen in fig",
    ".  [ fig6 ] , the line width of the @xmath1 mode reaches a maximum at about 80k . at this point",
    "it should be mentioned that a number of studies of spin ordering effects on the lattice dynamics in various substances always indicate strong changes of the phonon frequency and linewidth of all or selected modes with variation of temperature ( the hardening of optical phonons on cooling is common ) . as examples we can refer to the raman and some ir studies of ferromagnetic semiconductors cdcr@xmath0se@xmath20 and",
    "cdcr@xmath0s@xmath20  @xcite , ferromagnetic metal la@xmath21ca@xmath22mno@xmath23  @xcite , strongly correlated ferromagnetic metal srruo@xmath23  @xcite , half metal cro@xmath0  @xcite , antiferromagnetic halides of transition metals  @xcite , antiferromagnetic metal @xmath24-mnse  @xcite , etc .. as seen in the cited references quite different explanations were suggested to explain the observed effects .",
    "so far no general mechanism was identified . as for the case of cos@xmath0 l.falkovsky in a recent paper",
    "@xcite interpreted some of our data on the raman scattering in cos@xmath0 more or less successfully in the terms of the phonon - electron interaction , arising from interband transitions at finite temperature . as falkovsky",
    "s analysis shows the expected direct phonon - magnon interactions are unable to contribute significantly to the observed effects .",
    "note that according to the theory  @xcite the phonon - electron interactions in cos@xmath0 influence the line shift and width both in the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases .",
    "( color online ) frequency shift of @xmath1 mode in fes@xmath0 ( a ) and cos@xmath0 ( b)(fes@xmath0 data were obtained in the course of the current study).,width=302 ]    our view of the raman scattering features in cos@xmath0 is somewhat different .",
    "the nearly half metal nature of the ferromagnetic phase of cos@xmath0 creates a specific situation due to a spin - dependent band structure effect .",
    "this strongly modifies the ion - ion interaction in ferromagnetic cos@xmath0 as is evidenced by a decrease of its compressibility  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly one may expect higher frequencies of stretching modes in the ferromagnetic phase cos@xmath0 compared to the paramagnetic phase ( the hardening effect ) .",
    "the puzzling maximum in the line width , which appears below the curie temperature at high laser power excitation ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] ,  [ fig6 ] ) , most probably resulted from specifics of the decay mechanism in the ferromagnetic phase of cos@xmath0 , which certainly includes the klemence anharmonic contribution . on the other hand",
    "the optical phonons , as well as the thermal excitations , could directly or indirectly turn over the spins in the majority band , therefore filling out the minority band in cos@xmath0 .",
    "this action defines another channel of the decay in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the maximum in the line width probably implies that there exists one more channel of the decay , which reveals itself at high laser power excitation and which is almost exhausted at temperatures around 80 k.",
    "in conclusion , we measured the raman spectra of ferromagnetic nearly half metal cos@xmath0 in a broad temperature range .",
    "the magnetic ordering is signified by a change of the temperature dependences of the frequency and the line width of @xmath1 and @xmath25 modes at the curie point .",
    "the raman intensities are not practically affected by the magnetic ordering .",
    "variations of frequencies of the raman stretching modes in the ferromagnetic phase of cos@xmath0 define solely by the modified ion - ion interaction , which is altered due to the nearly half metallic character of the phase .",
    "this situation ceases to exist above the curie point , and it is plausible that the klemens anharmonic approach is valid in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the latter seems to be supported by the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the temperature dependencies of the @xmath1 modes of cos@xmath0 and fes@xmath0 are compared . as is seen the klemens approach works satisfactorily for fes@xmath0 and for the paramagnetic phase cos@xmath0 , which confirms our supposition . in the end",
    ", the maximum in the line widths below the curie temperature probably implies that there exists a specific channel of the decay , which reveal itself at high laser power excitation .",
