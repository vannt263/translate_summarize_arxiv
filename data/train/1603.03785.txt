    "the iron - based superconductors feature an antiferromagnetically ordered phase at low chemical doping that evolves into a superconducting phase upon further doping . in most cases , such as in the 1111- and 122-type materials ,",
    "the long - range antiferromagnetic order is preceded in temperature by a structural transition that lowers the lattice symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that this intermediate `` nematic '' phase is induced by incipient spin fluctuations above the magnetic ordering temperature @xcite .",
    "the electronic nematic state within this symmetry - broken phase is manifested through an array of striking behaviors , including a large in - plane resistivity anisotropy @xcite and a substantial splitting of orthogonal energy bands @xcite , with important ramifications for superconductivity in this class of materials . in compounds studied thus far , spatially - averaged signatures of nematic symmetry breaking are obscured by the presence of orthorhombic domains , compelling researchers to detwin samples via uniaxial strain .",
    "how the strain itself contributes to properties measured this way is also an active area of research @xcite .",
    "recently , a new family of iron - based superconductors  the 112-type materials  have been discovered .",
    "these materials contain zigzag as chains that break the tetragonal symmetry between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes , making samples intrinsically detwinned without the application of uniaxial strain .",
    "in addition , in contrast to all other known high - temperature superconductors , the reported crystal structure of the 112-type materials lacks a center of inversion @xcite .",
    "this is noteworthy because noncentrosymmetric superconductors in the presence of spin - orbit coupling can show a mixing of spin - singlet and spin - triplet cooper pairs @xcite , and spin - orbit coupling is expected to be non - negligible in the 112-type materials because of the presence of heavy rare earth atoms .",
    "the 112-type materials have chemical formula ca@xmath8__re__@xmath9feas@xmath4 , where _ re _ is a rare earth atom @xcite . in these compounds ,",
    "substitution of ca by rare earth ions is necessary for structural stability ; the @xmath10 endmember is unstable and can not be synthesized .",
    "one study of _ re _ = la has reported an enhancement of antiferromagnetism with increasing @xmath11 , with a maximum nel transition temperature at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the highest superconducting critical temperatures , exceeding 40 k , have only been achieved via a secondary doping mechanism such as chemical substitution or off - stoichiometry @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", it is argued that ca@xmath8la@xmath9feas@xmath4 with @xmath13 should be thought of as the `` parent '' of the family , with superconductivity induced by hole or electron doping away from this parent state @xcite . as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figure0](a ) and [ figure0](b ) , the crystal structure of ca@xmath2la@xmath3feas@xmath4 is unique among the wider family of iron - based superconductors . instead of showing a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural phase transition ,",
    "the material undergoes a monoclinic - to - triclinic transition at @xmath14 k followed closely by long range antiferromagnetic order at @xmath15 k @xcite .",
    "this unusually low crystalline symmetry is due to the presence of zigzag as chains running along the @xmath1-axis , breaking the symmetry between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes and distorting the atoms in the unit cell into a noncentrosymmetric arrangement . how the 112-type materials compare with the other iron - based superconductors  and",
    "in particular whether or not an electronic nematic state exists in the intermediate region between @xmath16 and @xmath17is an open question . in attempting to answer such a question ,",
    "it is imperative to understand the as - yet unknown detailed point group symmetry changes that occur at the reported monoclinic - to - triclinic transition .    when employed to determine crystallographic structure , diffraction experiments generally require accurate measurements of a multitude of bragg reflections and the analysis of such data through nontrivial structural refinement routines .",
    "it can therefore be challenging to detect minute changes in symmetry from such techniques .",
    "rotational anisotropy second harmonic generation ( ra - shg ) is an alternative method that relies on carefully measuring the tensor optical response of a crystal in order to determine the crystallographic and electronic point group symmetries of solids @xcite . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure0](c ) , in this technique an incident laser beam is focused onto a sample and the intensity of the second harmonic of the reflected light is measured as the angle @xmath18 between the scattering plane and a well - defined direction parallel to the sample surface is swept . by selecting a combination of different incoming and outgoing light polarizations  typically linear polarized either in ( p ) or out of ( s ) the scattering plane  the nonzero elements of the nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor @xmath19 can be deduced from the measured rotational anisotropy . in the electric dipole approximation of shg",
    ", @xmath19 is a third - rank tensor that relates the incident electric field components at frequency @xmath20 to the radiating dipole response @xmath21 of the material at frequency @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath23 by neumann s principle , the symmetries of the crystal completely determine the susceptibility tensor elements that are independent and nonzero . as a consequence",
    ", the underlying crystallographic point group symmetries of the sample under study can be deduced by carefully measuring the susceptibility tensor .",
    "accordingly , one can in principle study the symmetry changes across the monoclinic - to - triclinic transition in ca@xmath8la@xmath9feas@xmath4 using ra - shg .",

    "treating la substitution within a rigid band picture in which one free electron per la atom is added to the system , the fermi level ( @xmath25 ) will shift by a negligible amount ( @xmath26 ev ) for @xmath27 .",
    "ra - shg experiments were performed on the ( 001 ) crystal cleavage plane .",
    "samples were cleaved in air and then immediately placed in vacuum ( pressure below @xmath28 torr ) before measurement .",
    "we utilized a ra - shg setup that greatly improves the precision and sensitivity of the technique as compared to previous methods @xcite . in this setup ,",

    "the laser fluence at the sample was @xmath32 mj/@xmath33 and the ccd exposure time was 300 s for each image .",
    "after subtraction of a constant background resulting from ccd pixel readout noise , rotational anisotropy curves were extracted from the ccd images by radially integrating over the annular illumination region and then binning the data in 6@xmath34 intervals .",
    "we supplement our ra - shg measurements with pump - probe transient reflectivity experiments , which were carried out using 70 fs pulses from the same 800 nm laser with a pump fluence of @xmath30 mj/@xmath33 in a crossed linear polarization geometry .",
    "during shg , two photons at frequency @xmath20 are absorbed and one photon at frequency @xmath22 is emitted in a coherent quantum process between an occupied electronic level and two unoccupied levels .",

    "our ra - shg experiments at @xmath36 ev will therefore mainly probe states derived from the fe and ca @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "figure [ figure1](a - d ) show raw ccd images taken for ca@xmath2la@xmath3feas@xmath4 at a sample temperature of 70 k , where the crystal structure is monoclinic ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we measure a very strong shg response .",
    "this is consistent with a noncentrosymmetric point group because inversion - symmetric systems forbid bulk electric dipole shg and only allow weaker electric quadrupole and other higher - order responses @xcite . for comparison , under the same experimental conditions the bulk electric quadrupole response of sr@xmath24iro@xmath38",

    "we can measure possible changes in point group symmetry across the reported monoclinic - to - triclinic structural transition at @xmath14 k by examining the temperature dependence of the shg rotational anisotropy .",
    "the two possible point groups for a triclinic lattice are @xmath51 and @xmath7 .",

    ", we can conclude that the low - temperature point group is @xmath7 since we do not see a suppression of shg intensity expected if the lattice were to acquire inversion symmetry ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the spin order that sets in at @xmath17 should in principle also contribute to a change in the optical susceptibility .",
    "such a change , however , is likely to be overwhelmed by the strong nonmagnetic contribution already present above @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , in practice nonlinear optical studies of magnetic structure predominantly focus on centrosymmetric materials where the nonmagnetic bulk electric dipole response is zero @xcite .",
    "the absence of an observable change in the shg rotational anisotropy suggests that structural changes at the monoclinic - to - triclinic transition are subtle and do not significantly affect the electronic states near the fermi level that are probed by shg .",
    "in addition to ra - shg measurements , which we have shown mainly probe the fe and ca @xmath5-derived states in the crystal , we also present pump - probe transient reflectivity experiments because such measurements have previously been shown to be sensitive to raman active phonons involving as atoms in the iron - based superconductors @xcite .",

    "[ figure3 ] . immediately after the pump pulse",
    ", we observe a drop in reflectivity of order @xmath57 followed by a ps - timescale recovery with high - frequency oscillations superimposed .",
    "the long timescale behavior is likely due to the relaxation of hot electrons in the system by exchange of energy with the lattice .",
    "the high - frequency oscillations , on the other hand , are the result of the coherent excitation of an optical phonon mode .",
    "to isolate the oscillatory component of the response , we fit the reflectivity for @xmath58 to a constant plus a decaying exponential ( decay time @xmath59 ps ) and subtract it from the data .",
    "a fourier transform of the remaining oscillations produces a frequency power spectrum showing an isolated peak at 4.6 thz ( inset of fig .",

    ", we are not aware of any raman spectroscopy studies of the 112-type materials .",

    "we do not observe a change in the phonon frequency at the monoclinic - to - triclinic structural transition .",
    "this observation suggests that the potential landscape of the as atoms does not significantly change across @xmath16 and may indicate that the unit cell distortion at the transition is primarily within the @xmath62-plane [ as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure0](b ) ] since the phonon mode that we observe involves strictly out - of - plane motion .",

    "our results are consistent with ref .  , where a similar transient reflectivity experiment on the 122-type materials also revealed only the @xmath60 mode .",
    "they suggested that the phonon excitation mechanism was not impulsive stimulated raman scattering ( in which all optical phonon modes may be excited ) , but was instead either displacive excitation of coherent phonons or electronic temperature gradient .",
