    "the `` thick '' layer concept is evidently better , it treats differently the large terraces compared to the small pits inside . that the effective densities of the 2fold terminations are somewhat lower than the densities of some single 2fold planes is not contradictory , because these are included in the most dense layers .",

    "planes _ of atoms .",
    "the bands observed by a quasicrystal should be also a consequence of dense planes or plane - like layers within the quasicrystal , which , according to the secondary - electron pattern , lie perpendicular to the principal directions of the icosahedron .",

    "[ fig : compsei](a ) carries an information of the long - range order .",
    "we note that there are bands perpendicular to 2fold- and 5fold - symmetry directions , but not to 3fold - symmetry directions .",
    "a quantum mechanical single - site scattering calculation @xcite is a faithful representation of the sei pattern because it accounts for the wave nature of the secondary electrons .",
    "[ fig : compsei](b ) illustrates the results of the calculation  @xcite using the coordinate set of the model 2f .",
    "this approximation overestimates the scattering intensity along chains of atoms @xcite but suffices for purposes , since our interest is mainly in the presence or absence of bands on the screen . as in case of crystals @xcite",
    "the band width is inversely proportional to the spacing of crystallographic planes , and the band width is related to the distance of interatomic planes @xcite .",
    "the observed band widths reveal that the inter - planar distances of the highly dense 2fold planes are broader than these of the 5fold planes / plane - like layers by a factor 1.6 . in 5fold case ,",
    "from the model we predict the distance @xmath83@xmath84   , which is the distance between the highly dense @xmath20 and the @xmath22 plane - like layers in the terminating thick layer @xmath23 : @xmath43  @xmath85  @xmath86   , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . in the 2fold case , between the highly dense planes in the above",
    "defined `` thick '' layer , appears once the distance of 0.92   and twice the distance of 1.48   .",
    "hence , an average distance between the highly dense planes is @xmath87@xmath88   .",
    "and their ratio is @xmath89 .",
    "the sei method does not determine the bulk termination , ( it is testing the bulk circa 30   below the surface ) .",
    "however , in the case of the ordinary crystals , the kikuchi bands are related to the most dense atomic planes , and we show that the same holds true in the case of quasicrystals as well . hence we may claim that sei images are supporting the thick atomic layers of the high effective density to be the bulk terminations , if the bravais rule should be valid in quasicrystals as well .",
    "the not existing 3fold kikuchi bands are also supporting the model 2f , in which we find that the atoms collected by the 3fold planes are almost uniformly distributed among these , without the notable repetitive layers of higher densities .",
