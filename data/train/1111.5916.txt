    "the theory of polarons , the quasiparticles describing electrons in a polarizable medium , dates back to the early days of quantum theory @xcite , and it has been an active field of research ever since @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will develop a microscopic theory of intersubband polarons , that is , a theory of intersubband transitions coupled to longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons in semiconductor quantum wells .",
    "the coupling between intersubband transitions and lo - phonons is relevant for a number of optoelectronic applications , as it determines the lifetime of carriers in excited subbands @xcite . in particular a precise knowledge of lo - phonons intersubband scattering rates",
    "is important in the engineering of heterostructures for quantum cascade lasers @xcite .",
    "normally optoelectronic devices are designed to avoid being in resonance with optical phonon transitions , due to the high absorption between transverse and longitudinal optical phonon frequencies ( restrahlen band ) .",
    "a notable exception is provided by quantum cascade lasers operating near such optical resonances@xcite , in which instead the transitions between different subbands are almost resonant with lo - phonon modes .",
    "even if the coupling between intersubband transitions and lo - phonons in semiconductor quantum wells has indeed received some attention @xcite and intersubband polaron resonances have been clearly and unambiguously observed @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , there is no microscopic theory of such excitations , as the spectra of intersubband polarons are normally calculated with indirect methods . while such methods allow to calculate , at least qualitatively , the polaron dispersions , missing a microscopic description makes it difficult to study more complex phenomena as nonequilibrium physics , quantum vacuum effects or quantum phase transitions .    using a second quantization formalism , we will reduce the full electron - phonon hamiltonian to a quadratic , bosonic form , from which we will then calculate the polaron dispersions . in order to accomplish this task ,",
    "we show that coulomb interaction between electrons in conduction subbands naturally separates into a dominant and a perturbative part , accordingly to the number of electrons that can participate to each transition .",
    "moreover we will show how , thanks to the tight confinement of lo - phonons , the coupling between intersubband transitions and phonons can easily be in the ultrastrong coupling regime , a regime characterized by a coupling strength comparable to the bare frequency of the excitations @xcite",
    ". such fact can have interesting observable consequences , as a whole new range of physics is _ a priori _ observable in this regime : spectral deformations @xcite , quantum vacuum emission phenomena @xcite , electroluminescence enhancement @xcite and even quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ theory ] we will develop the general theory of the coupling between intersubband transitions and lo - phonons , that we will then apply in sec . [ numres ] to the case of gaas quantum wells , showing how the ultrastrong coupling regime can be reached even with such relatively weakly polar material . in sec .",
    "[ appendix ] we will compare the calculated dispersions with the ones obtained using an homogeneous dielectric function approach . finally a few considerations on the impact of our results and on possible future developments will be drawn in sec .",
    "in 1954 dicke @xcite noticed that a set of coherently excited identical dipoles relaxes radiatively much faster than a single , isolated one .",
    "this is due to the phenomenon of superradiance : @xmath0 identical dipoles behave as a single collective dipole @xmath1 times bigger .",
    "the concept of superradiance has been thoroughly applied to the study of intersubband polaritons @xcite in microcavity embedded quantum wells . in such systems the light couples to a collective electronic excitation and , as expected @xcite , the strength of the coupling between light and matter is proportional to the square root of the number of electrons involved .",
    "we will study the coupling of intersubband transitions with longitudinal optical phonons , considering also the role of coulomb electron - electron interaction .",
    "such couplings are extremely rich and , in order to limit the complexity of our investigation , we will need to determine which scattering channels are dominant and which are negligible .",
    "in general , if @xmath0 electrons undergo a certain transition in a coherent way , the strength of the coupling is enhanced by a factor @xmath1 .",
    "transitions involving a macroscopic number of electrons will thus be strongly enhanced and , for this reason , they will be treated exactly within an hamiltonian formalism , while the others ( involving only few electrons ) will be treated perturbatively ( or ignored altogether ) .",
    "the degree of collective enhancement of a scattering process will be evaluated looking at the number of electrons that can undergo the transition given fixed amounts of transferred impulsion and energy . in fig .",
    "[ cohex ] we show a few illustrative examples of collective and non - collective transitions .    in the case of the coulomb interaction , as we will see , only the intersubband terms , responsible for the depolarization shift , are collective .",
    "we will thus treat them exactly in the hamiltonian , while considering all the other terms in a rpa linear response approach .",
    "a ) an example of collective transition : an intersubband transition with small transferred momentum .",
    "all the electrons can undergo a transition resonant approximately at the same energy .",
    "b ) an example of non - collective transition : an intrasubband transition with transferred momentum much smaller than the fermi wavevector @xmath2 .",
    "the majority of electrons , being pauli blocked , do not participate to the process .",
    "c ) another example of non - collective transition : an intrasubband transition with transferred momentum of the order of @xmath3 , that is the minimum to allow all the electrons to undergo the transition avoiding pauli blocking .",
    "anyway there is a large energy spread between the different single electron transitions . for an infinite potential",
    "well , electrons on the two opposite borders of the fermi sea , with initial momenta @xmath4 parallel to the transferred momentum , have initially the same energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the electron effective mass and @xmath7 the fermi energy . after the transition they will end up with final momenta @xmath2 and @xmath8 , corresponding to final energies @xmath5 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "this implies that , even if the transition is not blocked , only a small fraction of the single electron transitions can be resonant at the same time . in both cases , given that only few electrons can participate to the collective transition , the superradiant enhancement factor will be small.,width=321 ]      we will consider a symmetric quantum well of length @xmath10 in a bulk of height @xmath11 , @xmath12 will be the surface of the sample . for the moment , we will limit ourselves to the case of a single quantum well , the general case of multiple wells will be addressed later in this section .    the quantum well",
    "is supposed to be doped in such a way that its fermi level is between the first and the second conduction subbands , separated between them by the intersubband gap energy @xmath13 .",
    "we will develop our theory using a zero temperature formalism ( @xmath14 ) , anyway our results will remain quantitatively accurate while the thermal population of the second subband remains negligeable . depending on material parameters and doping level , this could imply the necessity to perform experiments in different kinds of cryogenic environments .",

    "we will consider only the case of one single longitudinal optical branch , the expansion to the case of multiple branches not presenting any fundamental difficulty .",
    "moreover , we are interested only in phonons with small in - plane wavevectors ( in order to couple with coherent intersubband excitations ) , we can thus ignore phonon dispersion and write the free phonon hamiltonian as @xmath33      interaction between electrons and lo - phonons can be described using the frhlich hamiltonian @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the static and high frequency dielectric constants @xcite .",

    "<S> we present a microscopic quantum theory of intersubband polarons , quasiparticles originated from the coupling between intersubband transitions and longitudinal optical phonons . to this aim we develop a second quantized theory taking into account both the frhlich interaction between phonons and intersubband transitions and the coulomb interaction between the intersubband transitions themselves . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the coupling between the phonons and the intersubband transitions is extremely intense , thanks both to the collective nature of the intersubband excitations and to the natural tight confinement of optical phonons . </S>",
    "<S> not only the coupling is strong enough to spectroscopically resolve the resonant splitting between the modes ( strong coupling regime ) , but it can become comparable to the bare frequency of the excitations ( ultrastrong coupling regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus predict the possibility to exploit intersubband polarons both for applied optoelectronic research , where a precise control of the phonon resonances is needed , and also to observe fundamental quantum vacuum physics , typical of the ultrastrong coupling regime . </S>"
