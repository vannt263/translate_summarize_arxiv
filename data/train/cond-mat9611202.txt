    "eq.([dmd2 ] ) says that in the large @xmath2 limit the whole class of random variables @xmath4 reduces to just _ a single fluctuating degree of freedom _",

    "the fluctuations @xmath37 have been thoroughly studied and we know @xcite therefore that the probability distribution of @xmath34 is gaussian . the variables @xmath34 in @xmath7 and @xmath27 in @xmath12 are _ universal _ in the sense that they do not depend upon @xmath30",

    "we calculate the correlation of two observables @xmath4 and @xmath38 and find @xmath39 where @xmath35 and @xmath40 are known proportionality constants .",
    "we then exploit the fact that the prefactor in eq.([var3d ] ) factorizes into an @xmath30 and an @xmath41 dependent part .",

    "we show , again by explicit calculation , that in all dimensions @xmath13 the correlation between two arbitrary observables @xmath30 and @xmath41 has the form @xmath47 with a prefactor @xmath48 that no longer factorizes .",
    "hence for @xmath13 the fluctuations of the @xmath4 can not be described any more by a single random variable .",
    "our principal result , described above , is of a general nature . in sec.[secexamples ] we use our calculational framework to study three examples of fluctuating observables @xmath4 .",
    "one of these is the _ euler index _",
    "@xmath49 of the surface of the support of the three - dimensional random walk .",
    "we recall that the euler index of a closed two - dimensional surface embedded in three - dimensional space ( the surface of a `` swiss cheese '' ) is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of handles of the surface and @xmath52 the number of cavities enclosed by it . in sec.[secexamples ]",

    "we note that the expansion coefficients @xmath55 should satisfy the relation @xmath69 if the sum on @xmath3 in eq.([definma ] ) is to have a finite value in the infinite lattice limit .",
    "the expression ( [ definmxa ] ) averaged on all random walk trajectories represents the probability that the set @xmath58 has not yet been visited by the walk .",

    "elementary manipulations lead to the explicit relation @xmath72 in which @xmath73 and where , here and below , any time dependent quantity @xmath74 that occurs will be associated with a generating function @xmath75 .",

    "the coefficient @xmath90 appears in the literature @xcite as the electrostatic capacity of the set @xmath53 .",
    "the calculation of the correlation @xmath92 requires that we now consider the average of the product @xmath93 .",

    "the support of the two - dimensional walk is a flat two - dimensional surface with @xmath184 and therefore has euler index @xmath185 ; the number of boundaries @xmath183 is equal to one plus the number of unvisited islands enclosed by the support .",

    "the handles and cavities are nonlocal objects of varying sizes and shapes , and it is interesting that one should be able to calculate the euler index .",
    "the reason that this is possible is that the euler index can be expressed , by means of the gauss - bonnet theorem , as an integral over the surface of a function of the local curvature .",
    "we first need a discrete analog of the gauss - bonnet theorem , that is , an expression for @xmath188 as the sum over space of a function defined locally on a two - dimensional surface built out of plaquettes . in order to find the contribution from the surface around a specific vertex ,",
    "we examine all @xmath189 patterns of occupation numbers in the surrounding cubic volume of @xmath190 unit cubes .",

    "there are only 22 patterns not equivalent under symmetry operations , and therefore 22 weights to be determined .",
    "one can set up equations for these weights by requiring that the final expression correctly yield the known result for various surfaces having the topology of a sphere ( @xmath191 ) or of a torus ( @xmath192 ) .",
