    "@xcite first identified 3c66a as a qso using optical observations .",
    "it was subsequently classified as a bl lac object based on its significant optical and x - ray variability @xcite .",
    "bl lac objects are characterized by a double - humped spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and are further classified according to the location of the lower energy hump , usually interpreted as synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons .",
    "@xcite locate the synchrotron peak between @xmath4 and @xmath5 hz .",
    "therefore 3c66a is classified as an intermediate - frequency peaked bl lac ( ibl ) . to date , the majority of bl lacs detected at vhe ( very high energy : e @xmath0 100 gev ) are hbls ( high - frequency peaked bl lacs ) .",
    "only one other ibl , w comae , has been detected above 100 gev @xcite .    during states of high flux , continuum emission from the jet",
    "is dominant and overshadows the few emission lines from the rest of the galaxy .",
    "blazars have few , if any , detectable emission lines , which makes determining the redshift difficult even under the best conditions . based on a single line , interpreted as mg ii ,",
    "3c66a was determined to be at a redshift of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , @xcite identified a weak ly - alpha line corroborating these results .",
    "since both measurements rely on a single line , the redshift of this bl lac is considered uncertain .",
    "@xcite recently derived a lower limit of @xmath7 .",
    "the determination of the redshift is crucial to understanding this source at vhe energies due to the effect of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) @xcite .",
    "vhe @xmath1 rays are absorbed via pair production interactions with the infrared component of the ebl ( @xmath8 ) @xcite . at vhe energies",
    ", this absorption causes a decrease in the observed flux and a softening of the observed spectrum .",
    "one can calculate an optical depth ( @xmath9 ) based on an ebl density model , the redshift and the @xmath1-ray energy .",
    "the optical depth can be used to calculate the flux corrected for extragalactic absorption from the observed flux at a given energy ( @xmath10 ) . without an accurate measure of the redshift ,",
    "an accurate photon spectrum intrinsic to the blazar can not be calculated or modeled .",
    "the egret source 3eg j0222 + 4253 , detected at an integral flux between @xmath11 and @xmath12 photons @xmath13 s@xmath14 , is associated with 3c66a @xcite .",
    "measurements of the spectrum indicated that the spectral index of @xmath15 was influenced by the nearby pulsar psr 0218 + 42 , which is also inside the egret error box .",
    "a detailed study of the energy - dependent position of the egret source shows that the highest energy photons are coming from the bl lac and thus the spectrum is thought to continue out to the vhe band @xcite .",
    "a re - analysis of the egret data by @xcite finds a harder spectral index of @xmath16 and a flux above 100 mev of @xmath17 photons @xmath13 s@xmath14 .",
    "recently , the fermi gamma - ray space telescope also reported a detection of 3c66a , contemporaneous with vhe data taken by veritas in the 2008 - 2009 season , at a higher flux than previously reported by egret @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to detect 3c66a in vhe @xmath1 rays .",
    "the crimean astrophysical observatory reported a 5.1 @xmath2 detection above 900 gev at an average integral flux of @xmath18 @xmath13 s@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "additionally , both the whipple 10  m telescope @xcite and hegra telescope array @xcite observed 3c66a and reported upper limits of @xmath19@xmath13s@xmath14 ( 99.9% confidence ; above 350 gev ) and @xmath20@xmath13s@xmath14 ( 99% confidence ; above 630 gev ) , respectively .",
    "stacee reported several upper limits between @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath13 s@xmath14 above 150 - 200 gev depending on the source spectrum @xcite .",
    "recently , magic reported a @xmath23 detection of vhe emission above 150 gev from observations in september to december 2007 coincident with 3c66b .",
    "they exclude 3c66a as the source of the vhe emission at an 85% confidence level @xcite .",
    "the veritas detector is an array of four 12  m diameter imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes located in southern arizona @xcite .",
    "designed to detect emission from astrophysical objects in the energy range from 100 gev to greater than 30 tev , veritas has an energy resolution of @xmath2415% and an angular resolution ( 68% containment ) of @xmath25 per event . a source with a flux of 1% of the crab nebula",
    "is detected in @xmath26 hours of observations while a 5% crab nebula flux source is detected in @xmath27 hours .",
    "the field of view of the veritas telescopes is @xmath28 . for more details on the veritas instrument and technique ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "veritas observed 3c66a for 14 hours from september 2007 through january 2008 ( hereafter , the 2007 - 2008 season ) . from september through november 2008 ( hereafter , the 2008 - 2009 season ) , a further 46 hours of data were taken . in total , 180 twenty - minute exposures were made , where 109 exposures passed selection criteria which remove data with poor weather ( based on infrared sky - temperature measurements ) or with hardware - related problems .",
    "data collection frequently occurred during poor weather conditions causing the lower selection throughput demonstrated here . in total , the 2007 - 2008 season resulted in 4.7 hours live time and the recent 2008 - 2009 season produced 28.1 hours live time .",
    "the average zenith angle was @xmath29 .",
    "all data were taken on moonless nights in `` wobble '' mode where the telescopes are pointed away from the source by @xmath30 to allow for simultaneous background estimation @xcite .",
    "prior to event selection and background subtraction , the shower images are calibrated and cleaned as described in @xcite and @xcite . several noise - reducing event - selection cuts are made at this point , including rejecting those events where only the two closest - spaced telescopes participated in the trigger . following the calibration and cleaning of the data , the events are parametrized using a moment analysis @xcite . from this moment analysis ,",
    "scaled parameters are calculated and used for event selection @xcite .",
    "the event selection cuts are optimized _ a priori _ using data taken on the crab nebula , scaling the background and excess rates to account for a weaker source .",
    "these selection criteria are termed the `` standard cuts '' . since 3c66a is possibly very distant and",
    "the observed spectrum is expected to be soft , a modified `` soft cuts '' applies a further _ a priori _ optimization of increasing the @xmath31 cut ( the angular distance squared from the position of 3c66a and the reconstructed shower direction ) and decreasing the size cut ( the number of photo - electrons in an event ) for sources with a soft spectrum ( see table [ tab : cuts ] ) . unless stated otherwise , the `` soft cuts '' were used to generate the results presented in this paper .",

    "@xmath37 & @xmath38 & 170 & 1258 & 5282 & 0.1400 & 518 & 16.0 +    the reflected - region model @xcite is used for background subtraction . the total number of events in the on - source region is then compared to the total number of events in the more numerous off - source regions , scaled by the ratio ( called @xmath39 ) of the solid angles , to produce a final excess .",
    "an excess of 1791 events is observed from the direction of 3c66a ( 7257 on events , 31201 off events with an off - source normalization ratio @xmath39 of 0.1752 ) .",
    "the excess corresponds to a statistical significance of 21.1 @xmath2 using equation 17 from @xcite .",
    "the distribution of @xmath31 is shown in figure [ fig : theta2 ] .",
    "the shape of the excess is consistent with that expected from a point source ( 68% containment in @xmath40 ) .",
    "since lower - energy events are more poorly reconstructed and this data set is dominated by low - energy events , the @xmath31 distribution is wider than that of a harder - spectrum source .",
    "table [ tab : cuts ] details the results using soft cuts as well as standard cuts .",
    "note that the use of two different sets of cuts has an associated trials factor of two , which has negligible impact on the significance .    using the soft cuts , the differential energy spectrum over the energy range @xmath41 gev to @xmath42 gev is determined and is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the best fit of a power - law to these data yields an index @xmath3 with a chi - square of 1.94 for 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "an alternative analysis chain confirms this very soft spectrum .",
    "note that there were 1431 excess events detected during the flaring period from mjd 54740 through mjd 54749 which accounts for 80% of the total .",
    "thus , while the spectrum calculated here is for the full data set , it is dominated by the flare . assuming this power - law spectrum , the observed integral flux for the full data set above 200 gev is @xmath43 @xmath13 s@xmath14 ( @xmath44 of the crab nebula s flux ) . by comparison ,",
    "the 2007 - 2008 season yielded a significance of @xmath45 at a lower average flux above 200 gev of @xmath46 photons @xmath13 s@xmath14 , which is 26% of the flux seen in 2008 - 2009 .",
    "figure [ fig:2008lc ] shows the integral flux above 200 gev from 3c66a for each dark period ( the time between two full moons ) . the highest flux seen from 3c 66a occurred on mjd 54749 .",
    "significant variability is seen only during the dark period spanning september 25 through october 10 ( shown in the inset in figure [ fig:2008lc ] ) , with a chi - squared probability of 0.009% for a fit to a constant flux .",
    "no statistically significant evidence for variability is seen within any of the individual nights .",
    "fits of a constant to the nightly flux in any other dark period do not yield a chi - squared probability less than 10% .",
    "the radio galaxy 3c66b lies in the same field of view as 3c66a at a separation of @xmath47 and is also a plausible source of vhe radiation @xcite . with the recent detection of vhe emission from the 3c66a / b region by magic @xcite favoring 3c66b as the source and excluding 3c66a at an 85% confidence level",
    ", it is important to determine which of these objects is the source of the emission reported here .",
    "thus , a 2-dimensional gaussian shape was fit to the uncorrelated excess of @xmath1 rays , yielding a position of 2h 22 m 41.6s @xmath48 1.7s , @xmath49 02 35.5  @xmath48 21  , with an additional systematic angular uncertainty of 90  .",
    "the systematic error has been confirmed via optical pointing monitors which are mounted to each telescope .",
    "this rules out 3c66b as the source of the vhe emission reported here at a significance level of @xmath50 .",
    "3c66a lies @xmath51 from the fit position while 3c66b lies @xmath52 away and the total error on the fit is @xmath53 ( see figure [ fig : location ] ) .",
    "in addition to fitting the full data set , fits were made to the data divided into high ( @xmath54 gev ) and low ( @xmath55 gev ) energy bands under the assumption that the high - energy emission might originate from 3c66b while the low energy emission might come from 3c66a ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the fit to the position did not deviate from the measurement using the full data set .",
    "correlated variability studies utilizing optical , vhe and he ( 30 mev - 100 gev ) bands are underway to verify 3c66a as the source of vhe @xmath1 rays and will be the subject of a future paper . further restricting the veritas data to observations contemporaneous with magic in september to december 2007 , we calculate an upper limit , assuming the reported magic spectrum of @xmath56 , on the flux above 300 gev from 3c66b to be @xmath57 photons",
    "@xmath13 s@xmath14 at the 99% confidence level based on @xmath58 hours of data .",
    "magic reported an integral flux based on a @xmath59 hour exposure above 150 gev of @xmath60 photons @xmath13 s@xmath14 for their full data set ( approximately @xmath61 photons @xmath13 s@xmath14 above 300 gev ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to calculate a spectrum from the 2007 - 2008 season data due to low statistics .",
    "although veritas is more sensitive ( @xmath62 ) than magic the brief ( @xmath58 hour ) exposure on the 3c66a / b region in 2007 does not enable a clear determination of which object was the source of vhe emission in 2007",
    ". however , based on the magic flux , veritas expects @xmath63 excess events at the location of 3c66b in the full data set , whereas only @xmath64 are detected and the latter is consistent with expectations for spill over from 3c66a due to the veritas point spread function . therefore ,",
    "if the magic claims of vhe emission from 3c66b are correct , it must have been considerably brighter in 2007 than 2008 , and similarly 3c 66a must have been considerably brighter in 2008 than 2007 .",
    "veritas has observed the ibl 3c66a for a total of 32.8 hours good - quality live time from september 2007 through november 2008 , resulting in the detection of vhe @xmath1 rays with a statistical significance of 21.1 @xmath2 . the average integral flux above 200 gev is @xmath43 @xmath13 s@xmath14 ( @xmath44 of the crab nebula s flux ) .",
    "the differential energy spectrum is well fit by a soft power law with index @xmath65 between 200 and 500 gev .",
    "it is thought that the redshift of 3c66a is @xmath66 but this measurement is based upon a single , poorly detected line @xcite . a definitive measurement of the redshift is needed to determine the intrinsic spectrum of 3c66a , corrected for ebl absorption .",
    "the extreme distance of 3c66a , if true , will allow modelers to probe the evolution of the ebl with redshift . assuming the current redshift measurement of @xmath66 , we calculate a de - absorbed spectrum based on the ebl models of @xcite which are based upon recent measurements from the optical to the sub - millimeter .",
    "the original spectrum along with the corrected spectrum can be seen in figure [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "while this is not a definitive calculation of the intrinsic spectrum , due to the uncertainties in the redshift measurement and in the modeling of the ebl , it illustrates that the steepness of the measured spectrum could be due to the distance of 3c66a .    the initial announcement of a detection of vhe emission from 3c66a @xcite prompted several other groups and instruments to also observe this object @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fermi gamma - ray space telescope detected 3c66a at a level higher than that reported by egret .",
    "the swift observatory also monitored 3c66a over this time period , in the x - ray and uv bands . a future paper by the fermi collaboration",
    ", veritas collaboration and multi - wavelength partners will describe these results and provide details on correlated variability as well as a broadband spectral energy distribution for the 2008 data set .",
