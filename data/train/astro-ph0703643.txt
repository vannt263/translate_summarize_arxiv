    "galaxies are found in different environments like field , loose groups , compact groups and clusters .",
    "the environment plays an important role in the gas contents of galaxies .",
    "a range of gas removal processes work in these environments . depending on the position of the galaxy in the group or in the cluster , the galaxy looses gas to the environment to different degrees .",
    "spiral galaxies in cluster cores are well known to be atomic hydrogen ( )  deficient .",
    "they move through the dense hot cluster cores with high velocities and lose gas through ram pressure stripping @xcite . the hot ( @xmath0 k ) intracluster medium ( icm )",
    "can also strip gas from the galaxy through evaporation @xcite .",
    "detailed observations have been carried out over the past three decades to probe gas deficiency in cluster galaxies .",
    "they seem to suggest that a large fraction of the cluster galaxies are actually deficient in  .",
    "more deficient galaxies are found closer to the cluster centre and many galaxies have truncated or shrunken  disks or extraplanar gas indicating ram pressure stripping ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while cluster galaxies have been extensively studied , not many studies exist about the gas content and gas deficiency of the galaxies in groups and the possible gas removal processes that can succesfully work in such environments .",
    "compact groups have been studied better than loose groups .",
    "a sample of 72 hcgs were studied with single dish and a subset of those with the vla .",
    "the galaxies in the hcgs were found to be  deficienct by greater than a factor of 2 on an average . some of these groups have been detected in x - rays and the x - ray detection rate is found to be higher for the   deficient groups @xcite .",
    "content and deficiency studies of loose groups are not so well reported in literature .",
    "deficiency by a factor of more than 1.6 has been reported in some members of a loose group in the puppis region @xcite .",
    "galaxies in eridanus , a large loose group , have been found to be  deficient by a factor of 2 to 3 .",
    "about 31 galaxies from the eridanus group have been imaged in   using the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . from these images and the overall group properties ,",
    "tidal interaction was found to be the most likely gas removal mechanism responsible for the  deficiency of eridanus galaxies @xcite .",
    "ram pressure becomes an effective gas removal process only when the  surface mass density is less than @xmath1v@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the stellar surface mass density .",
    "so , larger the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) density , @xmath1 , and galaxy velocity , v , the more effective is this stripping .",
    "thus in the absence of a hot igm and a high velocity dispersion , tidal interaction appears to be the most favourable process by which galaxies in groups can lose gas , though there are some cases where ram pressure is also acting in groups @xcite .",
    "detection of hot intragroup medium ( igm ) in some poor groups has presented an intermediate environment between clusters and groups without a hot igm .",
    "when the group has a hot igm , ram pressure or thermal conduction can contribute significantly to make the galaxies deficient in .",
    "since low velocity dispersion in these groups increases the probability of tidal interactions , tidal assisted ram pressure stripping can also contribute to gas loss from galaxies @xcite .",
    "ngc2276 , a spiral in the ngc2300 group is found to be   deficient and signatures of the hot igm affecting the galaxy were detected @xcite",
    ". a comparative single dish study of the  contents of loose groups with and without the hot igm indicates that the x - ray emitting medium may play a significant role in removing gas from the galaxies , as galaxies in these groups are found to be more  deficient than the galaxies in groups without x - rays @xcite .",
    "thus it is interesting to study the  contents and morphologies of galaxies in groups with a hot igm , to see if igm assisted stripping has left its signatures in the  distribution of the galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we present gmrt   images of nine spiral galaxies in four groups whose igm is detected in x - rays .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the morphology of   in these galaxies and to see if the hot igm has in any way affected their   content and distribution .",
    "thirteen galaxies from four groups , where the igm has been detected in x - rays , were observed with gmrt in the   21 cm line .",
    "the four groups from which this sample of thirteen galaxies were drawn are ngc5044 , ngc1550 , ngc720 and ic1459 .",
    "they have a varied range of x - ray properties ( table 1 ) .",
    "ngc5044 is a well studied bright x - ray group with the diffuse emission being mostly circular in morphology with concentric isophotes @xcite .",
    "ngc1550 is amongst the brightest x - ray groups so far obsevred and has more relaxed x - ray morphology , except some assymetries near the group centre , than the other @xmath4 1kev groups like ngc5044 @xcite . ngc720 and ic1459 are moderately bright groups and are also comparatively nearer than the other two .",
    "all the groups have memberships @xmath5  10 to 20 and have at least one bright elliptical galaxy at their x - ray centres .",
    "gmrt  observations of thirteen galaxies from these four groups are presented in this paper .",
    "table 1 lists the group names , their distances , x - ray luminosities and temperatures of the igm and the number of galaxies observed with the gmrt .",
    "gmrt is an interferometric array of 30 antennas , each of 45 m diameter , spread over a maximum baseline of 25 km . at frequencies of @xmath5  1400 mhz",
    ", the system temperature and the gain ( k / jy ) of the instrument are 76k and 0.22 respectively . the full width at half maximum of the primary beam of gmrt antennas in l band ( frequency 1.4 mhz ) is 24 .",
    "the fx correlator of gmrt offers a total of 128 channels for spectral line observations in the full polar mode .",
    "the sources selected have a wide range in   content .",
    "the motivation was to study if there were any evidance of the hot igm being responsible for gas loss from these galaxies .",
    "all the sources are below 5  in optical size , their distances are between 20 to 60 mpc , and their declinations range from -36 @xmath6 to + 02 @xmath6 . with gmrt",
    "they were studied at a spatial resolution of @xmath53 kpc , a velocity resolution of @xmath513 km / s and to a   column density of @xmath5 1@xmath7 per @xmath8 .",
    "table 2 lists the relevant details of the observations carried out with the gmrt .",
    "data obtained with the gmrt were reduced using aips ( astronomical image processing system ) .",
    "the procedure used to get the total   maps and the velocity fields is the following .",
    "bad data ( dead antennas , antennas with significantly lower gain than others , rfi ) were flagged and the data was calibrated for amplitude and phase using standard primary and secondary calibrators .",
    "the spectral responses of the filters were corrected by calibrating the data using a standard primary calibrator or when availbale a strong secondary calibrator .",
    "the calibrated data were used to make both the  line images and the 20 cm radio continuum images .",
    "the continuum data set were prepared from the calibrated data using the line (   emission ) free channels ( frequencies ) .",
    "the data were then averaged in frequency and self calibrated .",
    "aips task imagr was then used to get the deconvolved high resolution contunuum images .",
    "for the   line images the calibrated data were continuum subtracted using aips tasks uvsub ( used to subtract a model , in this case the clean components from the continuum image , from the uv data ) and uvlin ( used to subtract continuum by making linear fits to the uv data ) . the task imagr was then used to get the final 3 dimensional deconvolved  data cubes . from these cubes the total   images and the   velocity fields were extracted using the aips task momnt. by definition the total  maps are the integrated flux density maps ,    @xmath9    and the velocity fields are the intensity - weighted first order moment of the  distribution at different velocities .",

    "the total  maps were produced at an angular resolution of 15@xmath17 to 25@xmath17 depending upon the distance to the galaxies , so that the  morphology could be studied at @xmath53 to 4 kpc resolution .",
