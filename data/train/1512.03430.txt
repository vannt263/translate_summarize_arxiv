    "typical characteristics of observed high redshift ( @xmath5 ) star - forming galaxies are their large baryonic cold gas fractions @xcite and high velocity dispersion , their irregular morphology and a few kpc - sized clumps containing baryonic masses of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the common understanding is that these higher gas fractions and densities lead to gravitationally unstable disks with a toomre parameter @xmath7 @xcite that fragment into a few kpc - sized objects ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this picture is supported by the detection of massive clumps in observations and from cosmological simulations .",
    "linear perturbation theory indeed predicts a dominant growing wavelength of order of several 100 pc to kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite however showed recently that this wavelength determines the initial sizes of a few axisymmetric rings growing from inside - out instead of a few kpc - sized clumps if initially the densities in the mid - plane are sufficiently resolved ( see also @xcite and figure 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "these rings break up into many clumps after they collapsed onto pc - scales .",
    "the typical clump ensemble in a simulation of a massive disk with @xmath8 is initially dominated by clumps with average masses of @xmath9 and a typical radius @xmath10 pc and later on most of the mass resides in a population of clumps with @xmath11 and a radius of @xmath12 pc ( m. behrendt et al . , 2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "interestingly , a similar mass range has been found in the studies of @xcite where the clumps fragment from spiral features produced at @xmath13 .",
    "later on , the clumps in our simulation quickly form groups on several 100 pc to kpc - scales which we will call clump clusters ( cc ) .",
    "+ in this letter we explore the question whether these ccs could resemble the properties of the giant clumps observed in redshift 2 galaxies .",
    "an important role plays the instrumental resolution which spatially smears - out the information on kpc - scales .",
    "hints for substructure are however mainly given by local gas - rich disk galaxies which can be observed with much higher resolution .",
    "the dynamo survey identified local galaxies with very similar properties as found at @xmath0 @xcite containing clumps with typical diameters @xmath14 kpc @xcite .",
    "+ we use a higher resolution version of the simulation presented in @xcite and compare clump cluster properties with the giant clumps of the five luminous star - forming disk galaxies at @xmath0 from @xcite .",
    "this pioneering work for the first time presented detailed line profiles of individual giant clumps .",
    "the following list summarizes the observationally motivated questions that can be explained by our cc scenario .    1 .",
    "do the giant clumps have substructure ?",
    "observationally , only one example of a very bright clump is found where a substructure is hinted in the velocity channel maps given the large beam smearing .",
    "2 .   what is the origin of the high intrinsic velocity dispersion @xmath3 of the clumps ? often this is attributed to stellar feedback , but in the analysis of the observations no significant correlation between local velocity dispersion and star formation rates could be found .",
    "3 .   are the giant clumps rotationally supported ?",
    "small velocity gradients are found along the clumps @xmath15 in the velocity residual maps which corresponds to net prograde and retrograde rotation with respect to the rotation of the galaxy . when considering the beam - smearing effects on",
    "the kinematics @xcite concluded that these clumps are either pressure supported by high velocity dispersion ( see also * ? ? ? * ) or they are still undergoing collapse because of the small velocity gradients .    in section [ sec : simulation ]",
    "we describe the simulation code and the disk setup and how we mimick the observations .",
    "section [ sec : results ] gives an overview of the disk evolution and addresses the single issues listed above .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : summary and conclusion ] we summarize the results and derive implications .",
    "we run the simulation with the hydrodynamical amr code ramses in a box of 48 kpc and with a maximum resolution @xmath16 pc . the hydrodynamical equations describing the evolution of the self - gravitating gas disk with an isothermal equation of state are solved by the hll riemann solver and the minmod slope limiter .",
    "a static dark matter halo is added as an external potential . to sufficiently resolve the mid - plane gas density distribution we represent the jeans length by at least @xmath17 grid cells at every resolution level and the refinement criterium stops at maximum resolution . to avoid artificial fragmentation also for higher densities at 2.9 pc resolution",
    "we add a pressure floor in order to assure @xmath18 grid elements per jeans length which leads to a lower limit for the clump radius of 10.3 pc @xcite .",
    "the same disk model as in @xcite is used .",
    "we adopt an exponential gas disk with total mass @xmath19 , scale length @xmath20 and outer radius @xmath21 .",
    "the toomre parameter is @xmath22 within @xmath23 and the disk is therefore unstable to axisymmetric modes in this radius regime .",
    "the dark matter halo has the density profile of @xcite with @xmath24 within 16 kpc .",
    "the isothermal temperature of @xmath25 k represents the typical micro - turbulent pressure floor and keeps the initial vertical density distribution stable until the disk fragments .",
    "we compare the results with the clump properties of the h@xmath26 observations of five disk galaxies from @xcite at @xmath27 .",
    "the instrumental angular resolutions of @xmath28 correspond to @xmath29 .",
    "we `` observe '' the simulated galaxy at an inclination @xmath30 which is the most likely value for a random orientation and construct line - of - sight ( los ) maps of the spatial and kinematic components .",
    "the resolution of the observational instrument is mimicked by convolving the los surface density with a 2d gaussian of fwhm = 1.6 kpc ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "the result can be interpreted as a map of the molecular gas surface density since the majority of the gas mass ( @xmath31 ) resides in clumps with surface densities @xmath32 .",
    "this corresponds to the observed h@xmath26 maps due to the usually adopted linear `` kennicutt - schmidt '' relation from @xcite ( phibbs calibration ) , see also @xcite . for the kinematic analysis we take the mass - weighted los velocity information of the simulation .",
    "@xcite found that the ratio of rotational velocity to local velocity dispersion in co agree to first order with ratios obtained from h@xmath26 of similar star forming galaxies .",
    "the los velocities of the clump regions in section ( 3.3 ) are binned into `` channels '' of width 34 @xmath33 and spatially convolved . to obtain the intrinsic clump velocities the beam - smeared los velocity of a rotating featureless exponential disk model",
    "is subtracted .",
    "we do not convolve with the instrumental spectral resolution of @xmath34 since this contribution is already removed in the observational values we compare with .",
    "the simulation evolves like in @xcite .",
    "the main difference in the new simulation is its higher spatial resolution which in turn increases the resolution of the ccs that are the focus of this letter .",
    "in addition , we were able to reduce the pressure floor to a more realistical value . the unstable disk fragments into rings from inside - out in excellent agreement with the local fastest growing wavelength .",
    "the rings subsequently break up into hundreds of clumps , identified with a clump finder @xcite and considering gas densities @xmath35 .",
    "the clump statistic will be discussed in great details in a forthcoming paper ( m. behrendt et al . , 2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "the clumps initially have typical masses of several @xmath36 and radii around 35 pc .",
    "they later on evolve by merging with other clumps and re - organize themselves into large clump clusters . the fragmented disk ( at 655 myr )",
    "can be seen in the los surface density map in figure 1a . in this simulation",
    "we do not include stellar feedback .",
    "we however refer to the study and discussion in @xcite who have shown that mainly the clumps below a mass of a few @xmath37 are short - lived and effected by stellar feedback processes while the more massive clumps can survive several hundreds of myr which is long enough for clump clusters to form , as discussed in the next section . in future work",
    "we will include stellar feedback in order to investigate its effect on the evolution .",
    "the clumps organize themselves into clusters on several 100 pc to kpc scales .",
    "these clump clusters represent groups of individual clumps with diameters @xmath38 100 pc . as an example , a zoom - in onto the cluster a in the evolved disk ( 655 myr ) is shown in figure 1b .",
    "the region has a radius of @xmath39 in the face - on view .",
    "when we convolve the los surface density map with a gaussian filter of fwhm = 1.6 kpc the substructure of the ccs is completely smeared out ( figure 1c ) .",
    "they now appear as single entities , arranged into a ring with a radius of 4 - 7.7 kpc around the center of the galaxy . at t=655 myr",
    "we also find that clump clusters merge in the center of the galaxy , leading to the formation of a bulge component .",
    "the details of bulge formation by ccs will be investigated in a forthcoming paper ( m. behrendt et al . , 2016 , in preparation ) . here",
    ", we focus on the prominent ccs , labeled a , b , c , d , e in the galactic disk region . since the disk is fragmenting from inside - out these clusters were build from clumps that formed after 300 myr .",
    "the beam smeared cc s surface densities peak at @xmath40 and the more elongated clusters ( b , c ) have somewhat smaller surface densities in the convolved map compared to the clusters with more concentrated substructure ( a , d , e ) .",
    "their large radii of @xmath41 kpc ( figure 1d ) are similar to the identified clumps in @xcite .",
    "the cc s total masses are @xmath42 .",
    "the typical clumps in @xcite have masses a few times @xmath43 and the most extreme clumps masses of @xmath44 .",
    "the difference to our result can by explained by the around three times larger total baryonic mass in their observed galaxies .",
    "the measured intrinsic velocity dispersion of the five ccs is shown in figure 1e .",
    "before we construct the integrated spectrum of the cluster regions we take the los velocity and bin it into `` channel '' maps of width 34 @xmath33 which we spatially convolve with a gaussian of fwhm = 1.6 kpc .",
    "then we subtract the beam - smeared rotation of the smoothed galactic disk model to extract the velocity imprint of the clumps .",
    "the remaining integrated residual velocities of a cluster region are normalized to the maximum `` intensity ''",
    "( los surface density ) . as shown in figure 1e",
    "our ccs have velocity dispersions of @xmath45 in remarkable agreement with the observations .",
    "these high values are a result of the internal irregular motions of their substructures .",
    "the original ( unsmeared ) data gives almost the same velocity dispersion with only @xmath46 difference .",
    "in not enough resolved numerical simulations of gas - rich disks the kpc - sized clumps are fast rotating and supported by internal centrifugal forces .",
    "this is in contradiction to the observations that indicate dispersion - dominated clumps , being stabilized by random motion rather than rotation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the high resolution simulations presented in @xcite indeed show a rich spectrum of substructures ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similar to our simulation .",
    "they argue that the internal supersonic turbulence dominates the kinematics of the giant clumps and induces the break - up into sub - units .",
    "we instead conclude that small clumps form first , organize themselves to giant clusters which build the substructure that regulates the cluster dynamics .",
    "following genzel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) we measure velocity gradients along cuts of largest gradients @xmath47 of the ccs of our beam smeared residual maps ( inclination corrected ) which we indicate with arrows in figure 1c .",
    "the gradients range in between @xmath48 ( figure 1e ) which is again in surprisingly good agreement with the observations .",
    "the self - rotation of the individual clumps within a cc is completely washed out and only a gradient over the whole cluster region remains which has several reasons . for better understanding",
    "we show the un - smeared los residual velocities in figure 1f where the clusters can be identified as `` rotating islands '' ( a , b , d , e ) .",
    "they appear as large blue and red shifted areas with small substructures of high velocities representing the individual , spinning clumps .",
    "cluster c shows only a modest imprint of a velocity gradient with @xmath49 since its substructures are `` coincidently '' close together .",
    "the other clusters rotate either slowly or faster around their centers of mass and are continuously perturbed by encounters with other ccs .",
    "we could not find any correlation between the kinematics and their masses or radii .",
    "clusters with a larger @xmath50 have a tendency to also have an increased @xmath51 in our snapshot , however , the statistics is too low to argue that it is significant .",
    "the observed clumps also show prograde and retrograde velocity gradients with respect to the rotation of the galaxy .",
    "a giant clump which formed due to gravitational instability in a sheared disk should however have an angular momentum vector pointing into the same direction as its host galaxy .",
    "this coordinated rotation is indeed seen in the clumps that formed initially by gravitational disk instabilities .",
    "the situation is however different for our ccs as they continuously interact or merge with clumps .",
    "the clusters a , b , e rotate retrograde while c and d rotate prograde ( indicated by the direction of the arrow from blue to redshifted velocities in figure 1c and by the symbols in figure 1e ) .",
    "we compared a high - resolution simulation of a clumpy massive gas disk with the @xmath0 galaxies of @xcite .",
    "the toomre unstable @xmath52 disk naturally evolves into a large number of clumps , initially with an average mass @xmath53 ( @xmath54 pc ) and later on most of the mass in mergers of @xmath11 with a radius of @xmath12 pc ( m. behrendt et al . , 2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "they subsequently self - organize into several 100 pc to kpc - sized clump clusters ( ccs ) in a ring - like distribution .",
    "we analyze the fully fragmented disk at an inclination of @xmath55 . by mimicking the observations we find the following results :    1 .   in the beam - smeared disk ( fwhm = 1.6 kpc )",
    "the small - scale substructure disappears and only a few giant clumps are visible with @xmath1 kpc and masses of @xmath2 . they are organized in a ring with a radius of 4 - 7.7 kpc around the center of the galaxy .",
    "the giant clumps are actually clump clusters and show a rich substructure on pc scales .",
    "the model galaxy has around three times less baryonic mass than the observed galaxies in @xcite which is reflected in 3 times less massive clump clusters . 2 .",
    "the high intrinsic velocity dispersion @xmath56 of the ccs is caused by their subclump s high irregular motions .",
    "this is in contrast to previous assumptions that attributed the dispersion to turbulence , generated by stellar feedback .",
    "we tested the effect of beam smearing on the inferred velocity dispersions and find no significant differences , indicating that these signatures can be used as realistic indicators of the cc kinematics .",
    "the observed high dispersion of massive clumps in gas - rich galaxies might therefore be indirect evidence for a cluster of weakly bound substructures and a characteristic property of ccs .",
    "this is also in agreement with the finding of @xcite that there does not exist a correlation between their dispersion of @xmath57 and the star formation rates .",
    "the clump clusters show small velocity gradients @xmath48 which corresponds to net prograde or retrograde rotation with respect to the galaxy .",
    "the larger values correspond to faster rotating ccs and the smaller either to slowly spinning clusters or the substructure is `` coincidently '' close together to appear as a giant clump when beam - smeared .",
    "we demonstrated that clump clusters can explain many observed properties of giant clumps at high - redshift .",
    "if the observed unresolved massive clumps indeed are ensembles of dense subclumps , this has strong implications for any model that infers their evolution .",
    "kpc sized clumps are expected to migrate to the disk center via dynamical friction and tidal torques on a few orbital timescales where they contribute to the formation of a bulge .",
    "the cc scenario could have a strong effect on the estimated migration timescale of dense gas into centers of gas - rich galaxies which can have strong influence on the feeding of central black holes and agn activity .",
    "star formation and stellar feedback processes should also be strongly affected by the substructure @xcite and their chemical enrichment history .",
    "here we focused on the structure of ccs and their observational properties .",
    "however , ccs also have an interesting and complex evolution .",
    "they for example are exchanging their substructure or even disperse and reform .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in a subsequent paper .",
    "we thank the referee for constructive comments that improved the quality of the manuscript .",
    "we are grateful to philipp lang , lucio mayer , go ogiya , michael opitsch and valentina tamburello for fruitful discussions .",
