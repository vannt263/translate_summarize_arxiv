    "the absorption is @xmath23 10@xmath16 h @xmath17 , somewhat higher than the value derived by hellier ( 1994 ) , but consistent with the asca value .",
    "we therefore adopt the power - law index of 1.46 for the spectrum of rxj0146.9@xmath06121  to calculate 0.5 @xmath7 10.0 kev luminosities for comparison of the different observations assuming a distance of 2.5 kpc .",

    "was scanned for about 3 days around august 1 , 1990 , 2.5 years before the rosat pointed observation .",
    "the average count rate during the total net exposure of 539 s was a factor of 1.8 below the count rate seen during the pointed observation ( motch et al .",
    "1997 ) , i.e. at an intensity level comparable to the hri observation . again assuming the same spectrum as during the pointed pspc observation the luminosity was about 1.9 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3",
    "xpersei  was re - observed by rosat using the hri as focal plane detector on february 28 , 1995 between 05:31 and 10:14 ut for a net exposure time of 7743 s and from august 16 , 1995 23:32 ut to august 20 , 1995 01:28 ut for 9829 s. the average count rates were 0.84 @xmath1 0.01 counts s@xmath3   and 0.85 @xmath1 0.01 counts s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the light curve of the august observation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.rates_xper ] .",
    "the temporal behaviour is similar to the pspc observation in 1992 ( haberl 1994 ) with the pulse modulation on top of factor @xmath82 variations with time scales of around 2 hours . assuming the power - law spectrum best representing the pspc spectrum ( photon index 0.64 and  = 1.4 10@xmath21 h @xmath17 ) , an average hri count rate of 1.0 counts s@xmath3  is expected .",
    "the lower observed hri count rate may be caused by higher absorption as it was e.g. observed during the bbxrt observation (  = 2.5 10@xmath21 h @xmath17 , schlegel et al .",
    "1993 ) or by a lower intrinsic x - ray intensity . thus ,",
    "unless the x - ray spectrum has changed dramatically , the x - ray luminosity is in the range 3@xmath74 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ( 2@xmath710 kev using a distance of 1300 pc for comparison with previous measurements ) , at the same level xpersei  was always detected after its outburst in 1975 ( roche et al .",
    "1993 , haberl 1994 ) .    a timing analysis of the xpersei  hri observations performed in the same way as for rxj0146.9@xmath06121  yields a pulse period of 837.2 @xmath1 0.1 s for the august 1995 observation .",
    "the observation from february 1995 was too short and did not cover a long enough base line to constrain the period .",
    "the new hri measurement further continues the spin - down episode of xpersei  with @xmath4/@xmath24 10@xmath6 y@xmath3 .    to improve the statistics of the pulse profile",
    "the two hri observations were combined by assuming a constant @xmath4 value of 2.4 10@xmath25 s s@xmath3 as it was observed between the pspc and the second hri observation .",
    "the profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.puls_xper ] .",
    "although the statistical quality is still low the profile is consistent with that obtained from the pspc observation .",
    "x - ray observations of the 1400 s pulsar rxj0146.9@xmath06121  from asca and rosat between 1990 and 1996 show the source to be at a low luminosity around 2 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ( 0.5 @xmath7 10 kev , 2.5 kpc ) .",
    "this is a factor of 20 fainter than the outburst luminosity seen by exosat in august 1984 .",
    "a large decrease in pulse period from 1455 s to 1412 s occured between 1984 and 1993 ( hellier 1994 ) . during the asca and rosat observations ,",
    "september 1994 and february 1996 , the period was measured to be 1407.4 s and 1407.3 s , respectively .",
    "the last x - ray observations suggest that the spin period of the neutron star in rxj0146.9@xmath06121  has reached a relatively constant value of 1407 s for an x - ray luminosity of a few 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "this period is unlikely the kepler period at the inner accretion disk which is bounded by the neutron stars magnetosphere to be in accretion equilibrium , as it would imply a magnetic field strength of 8 10@xmath26 g for a standard 1.4 m@xmath27 neutron star with 10 km radius .",
    "this is much higher than magnetic field strength values derived from cyclotron features seen in the x - ray spectra of x - ray pulsars which only in the case of a0535 + 26 may reach 10@xmath26 g ( grove et al .",
    "for more typical values of b around 10@xmath28 g the equilibrium period for a luminosity of 2 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 is expected to be around 40 s , far from the observed period .",
    "the monotonic spin - down episode in xpersei  indicates that any accretion disk is transitory , only forming during outbursts .",
    "standard accretion disk theory then predicts ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "1992 ) spin - up as was observed from xpersei  during the outburst .",
    "the long spin period indicates that the episodes of spin - down dominate the spin period changes and the increased accretion via a disk during rare outbursts does not bring the spin into equilibrium .",
    "if a similar scenario is valid for rxj0146.9@xmath06121 , the low @xmath7 still slightly decreasing @xmath7 x - ray luminosity and the much reduced spin - up observed in the last years suggests that the accretion disk has dissipated and that it may also enter an episode of low x - ray luminosity and spin - down .",
    "evolutionary considerations suggest that be@xmath7neutron star binary systems are formed from close binaries of massive stars ( van den heuvel 1983 ) .",
    "xpersei  and rxj0146.9@xmath06121  are probably systems with long orbital periods of the order of several hundreds of days .",
    "a 580 day period claimed for xpersei  ( hutchings et al .",
    "1974 ) could however not be confirmed .",
    "one such long orbital period system is psrb1259@xmath763 , a 47ms pulsar in a 1237 day orbit around a be star .",
    "if the neutron stars in xpersei  and rxj0146.9@xmath06121  were born with similar short spin period and their present long spin periods are due to spin - down they must be older systems .",
    "the asca spectrum of rxj0146.9@xmath06121  is the first measured broad band spectrum ( 0.8 @xmath7 10 kev ) without confusion by the close pulsar 4u0142 + 61 .",
    "it is consistent with a power - law with photon index 1.5 which is relatively steep for x - ray pulsars ( typical 0.8 @xmath7 1.5 , nagase 1989 ) .",
    "xpersei , the other long period pulsar , also shows a steep spectrum with a photon index of 0.8 and an exponential cutoff above 2.2 kev .",
    "this cutoff - model was suggested by bbxrt data ( schlegel et al .",
    "1993 ) and the break confirmed by the flatter rosat pspc spectrum in the 0.1 @xmath7 2.4 kev range ( haberl 1994 ) . combining the rosat pspc and the asca gis spectra of rxj0146.9@xmath06121  in a simultaneous model - fit shows that the spectrum can also be represented by a power - law with exponential cutoff as in the case of xpersei .",
    "the power - law index , cutoff and folding energy ( 0.69 , 2 kev and 5.7 kev , respectively ) are consistent within the errors with those found from xpersei .",
    "it has been suggested that the cutoff seen in the power - law spectra of x - ray pulsars is related to the magnetic field strength of the neutron star . observed cyclotron line energies e@xmath29 and cutoff energies e@xmath30 are correlated with e@xmath29 @xmath8 2 e@xmath30 ( makishima & mihara 1992 , see also white et al .",
    "this would suggest field strengths of a few 10@xmath31 g for xpersei  and rxj0146.9@xmath06121  ( if there is a break in the spectrum ) , one order of magnitude lower than for typical x - ray pulsars which show cutoff energies of 10 @xmath7 20 kev .",
    "however , no cyclotron features have been directly seen in the spectra of xpersei  and rxj0146.9@xmath06121 . at these relatively low magnetic fields strengths",
    "the distortion of the spectrum from the neutron star surface will be much reduced , and the spectrum should resemble a blackbody ( white et al .",
    "a luminosity dependence of the cutoff energy seen from exo2030@xmath0375 also indicates that the cutoff energy may not provide a reliable measure of the surface magnetic field strength ( reynolds et al.1993 ) .",
    "rxj0146.9@xmath06121  and xpersei  show persistent low - level x - ray flux after their outbursts with little variations .",

    "( 1997 ) derive a spectral type and luminosity class of b1v , more consistent with 2.5 kpc .",
    "we use a revised distance estimate for xpersei  of 700 pc ( lyubimkov et al .",
    "1997 , roche et al .",
    "this relatively constant x - ray luminosity needs to be explained in the framework of stellar wind accretion .",
    "xpersei  is well observed in the optical and large changes in the morphology of the circum - stellar envelope are indicated .",
    "the v - band light curve shows extended faint states and spectroscopic observations revealed a phase transition of the be star to a normal b star in the last extended low state 1989 to 1993 ( roche et al .",
    "1993 , 1997 ) which indicates the disappearance of the equatorial low - velocity and high - density outflow around the be star .",
    "the x - ray outburst of xpersei  in 1975 happened during an optical extended low - state , suggesting that the dissipating circum - stellar matter crossed the neutron star and leading to enhanced accretion .",
    "in contrast no similar x - ray outburst was observed during the last extended optical low - state .",
    "one possibility may be that the orbital plane is inclined against the equatorial plane of the be star with the neutron star well outside the equatorial dense outflow during the last phase transition .",
    "however uv observations of be stars indicate a low - density wind at higher latitudes and the derived low mass loss rates of the order of 10@xmath25 to 10@xmath32 m@xmath27 y@xmath3 and high outflow velocities up to 2000 km s@xmath3 can not account for the observed x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ( see e.g. waters et al .   1988 ) .",
    "if the neutron star moves in the equatorial plane a radially outward moving dense wind region can only miss the neutron star if it is highly non - axisymmetric .",
    "long term variations in the ratio of the intensity of the violet and red peak of the balmer emission lines is commonly observed from be stars , consistent with such an asymmetry in the matter distribution around the star ( e.g. @xmath33 cas , telting & kaper 1994 ) .",
    "in particular the optical counterpart of rxj0146.9@xmath06121  shows that either the violet or the red part of the line can be in absorption ( motch et al .",
    "1997 , reig et al .",
    "1997 ) indicating that the dense wind outflow responsible for balmer emission is sometimes located only on one side of the star .",
    "the relatively constant x - ray luminosity then suggests that even in the case of a \" complete loss  of the dense equatorial stellar envelope as indicated by balmer lines in absorption , a basic high - density low - velocity outflow is permanently present to power the x - ray source .",
    "this picture also suggests that the frequency of x - ray outbursts in wide be / x - ray binaries is lower than that of be@xmath7b star phase transitions . to prove this , further monitoring of rxj0146.9@xmath06121 , xpersei  and other low - luminosity be / x - ray binaries like those discovered by rosat ( motch et al .",
