    "what makes the vfe particularly interesting to study is its connection to integrability , more precisely to the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) .",
    "one way of formulating this connection is in terms of frenet - serret frame of the curve .",

    "an immediate consequence of the connection of the vfe with the nls equation is the existence of large classes of special solutions of the vfe ( including solitons and multi - solitons , and finite - gap solutions ) and the presence of an infinite number of conserved quantities in involution @xcite .",

    "in previous works by the authors and their collaborators @xcite , a method was developed to study the linear stability of solutions to the vfe .",
    "the idea of the method relies on one main result , which we present in this section .",
    "we start by introducing the _ natural frame _",
    "@xcite , which is particularly appropriate for the study of the vfe .",
    "the natural frame @xmath40 is obtained from the frenet frame by rotating the normal and binormal vectors in the normal plane : @xmath41 where @xmath13 is an antiderivative of the torsion ( as in the hasimoto map ) .",
    "the result of this choice of rotation is that the derivatives of vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 are multiples of the tangent vector : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the _ natural curvatures_.",
    "the natural curvatures thus become the real and imaginary parts of the nls solution , which has the consequence of simplifying the hasimoto map ( [ hasimoto ] ) as it now reads @xmath47    the linear stability of a solution @xmath2 of the vfe is studied by replacing @xmath2 in by @xmath48 and retaining terms up to first order in @xmath49 : @xmath50 since @xmath4 in the vfe is the arclength parameter , a vfe solution is required to have a tangent vector with unit length . at first order , this means that @xmath49 must be a locally arclength preserving ( lap ) vector field , i.e.  @xmath51 .",
    "the idea to solve the linearized vfe ( [ lvfe ] ) is to look for solutions of the form of an expansion along the vectors @xmath52 , that is @xmath53 with @xmath49 written in the form above , the lap condition is realized by the restriction @xmath54 .",
    "we start with a vfe solution @xmath2 corresponding to an nls solution @xmath15 through the hasimoto transformation ( [ hasimoto ] ) ( or , equivalently , ( [ hasimoto2 ] ) ) .",
    "we insert the expression ( [ ansatz ] ) into the linearized vfe and , by a lengthy but straightforward computation , we have the following result :    [ t1 ] let @xmath49 be a solution of the linearized vfe of the form ( [ ansatz ] ) and satisfying the lap condition @xmath55 .",
    "then , the quantity @xmath56 satisfies the linearization of the nls about the solution @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the real and imaginary parts of a solution of linearized nls .",
    "this remarkable observation reduces the problem of solving the linearized vfe to the problem of solving linearized nls .",
    "the linearized nls can be solved systematically for large classes of solutions .",
    "indeed , one can construct solutions of the linearization on the nls from the solutions of the akns system ( [ akns ] ) through the so - called _ squared eigenfunctions _ @xcite .",
    "this fact often enables one to solve the linearization completely in the desired space .",
    "for example , in the case where the solution @xmath15 is a soliton solution ( where the space is @xmath59 ) , a complete set of solutions of the linearization ( in the sense that for any fixed value of time @xmath1 , it spans @xmath60 ) can be constructed using the squared eigenfunctions @xcite . in the periodic case",
    ", the question of completeness of the set of squared eigenfunctions remains unsolved .",
    "however , it is expected that the same type of results holds @xcite .",
    "note that this question was also considered for the sine - gordon equation @xcite . in the case of some genus one",
    "( traveling wave ) periodic nls solution , the question of completeness has been solved recently ( see for example @xcite )",
    ".    our first goal will be to extend the result of theorem [ t1 ] to the whole vfe hierarchy .",
    "as a completely integrable system , the nls has an infinite number of conserved quantities which are in involution with respect to the poisson bracket associated to the nls hamiltonian ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "each of the equations in the hierarchy is integrable and admits a corresponding akns linear system ; the spatial part of each system is the same as in the system for nls .",
    "( these akns systems are constructed explicitly in section [ hie ] . )",
    "the vfe is also part of a hierarchy of integrable geometric evolution equations for curves @xmath61 for @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a vector field along space curve @xmath2 ; for example , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 gives the vfe .",
    "( further members of this hierarchy are generated recursively , as explained below . )",

    "conversely , given a solution @xmath15 of @xmath39 and a fundamental matrix solution @xmath75 of the corresponding akns system , then the sym transformation evaluated at @xmath76 gives a curve that ( with our identification of @xmath77 with @xmath78 ) satisfies @xmath79 , and whose natural curvatures are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath15 ( see prop .  26 in @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , if is evaluated at a nonzero @xmath80 , then the resulting curve will evolve by a linear combination of @xmath81 and flows earlier in the hierarchy .",
    "for example , the sym transformation applied to the nls equation gives rise to the modified version of the vfe given in . for the generalization to higher order ,",
    "see corollary [ modcor ] .    in this section",
    ", we will describe the main properties of the vfe hierarchy .",
