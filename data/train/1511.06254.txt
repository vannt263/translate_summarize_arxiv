    "monolayers of transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) are two - dimensional semiconductors and have gained great interest in recent years due to their remarkable electronic and optical properties.@xcite they possess a direct band gap with a magnitude in the optical range@xcite and optical selection rules which allow for manipulation of the valley and spin degrees of freedom@xcite providing them with great potential for future device applications .",
    "these tmdcs are a class of materials with the chemical composition mx@xmath0 where m represents a transition - metal ( e.g. m = mo , w ) while x corresponds to a chalcogen atom ( e.g x = s , se , te ) .",
    "these atoms form a honeycomb crystal lattice analogous to graphene but possess a semiconducting electronic structure with the band gap minima located at the k and k@xmath1 points of the hexagonal brillouin zone , where the gap is due to a broken inversion symmetry . indeed",
    ", these materials have already been shown to produce two - dimensional field effect transistors with on / off ratios orders of magnitude larger than in graphene.@xcite additionally , the heavy transition - metal atoms endow the material with strong spin - orbit coupling most visibly seen in the large splitting observed in the valence band ranging from @xmath2 in mos@xmath0 to @xmath3 in wse@xmath0 crystals.@xcite    while there has been much interest in the optical and electronic properties of the tmdcs it has also been shown that mos@xmath0 crystal membranes have mechanical properties comparable with graphene oxide and are able withstand mechanical strains up to @xmath4.@xcite mechanical resonator devices have been demonstrated@xcite and suspended devices have been fabricated for study in optical and electronic transport experiments.@xcite these properties imply that tmdcs offer a route to studying novel nano - electromechanical systems of semiconducting membranes and the role of mechanical deformations on their electronic structure , optical and transport properties .    in this work",
    "we theoretically investigate the role of elastic deformations on the electronic properties of the tmdcs , by incorporating the effect of strain into a tight binding model .",
    "in general , deformations of the crystal lattice lead to modifications of the bond lengths which create corrections to the electronic hamiltonian.@xcite in addition curvature of the crystal lattice creates corrections to the hybridization of the localized orbitals which in general lead to new couplings between bloch bands.@xcite we take an approach which allows for a description of any arbitrary lattice deformations by treating modifications of bond lengths and curvature on equal footing and including the effects of spin - orbit interactions .",
    "then we present a low energy effective theory which describes lattice distortions , spin - orbit coupling and lattice - spin coupling .",
    "we also fit our tight binding model to first principle calculations of mos@xmath0 and use the obtained band parameters to predict the energy scales of these strain / curvature - electronic coupling mechanisms .    due to the large spin orbit interaction and unusual spin - valley coupling within tmdcs , these materials hold particular interest for spintronics applications .",
    "out - of - plane flexural motion of the lattice creates ripples and corrugations of the crystalline membrane which have been observed in mos@xmath0 crystals@xcite and these provide electronic scattering mechanisms which are unique to two - dimensional materials.@xcite in light of this , lattice - spin coupling is of particular interest in spin transport as a mechanism for spin relaxation@xcite or possible spin manipulation mechanisms .",
    "to date several authors have studied spin transport and spin relaxation rates in tmdcs by symmetry based techniques,@xcite but a precise knowledge of the coupling parameters was not clear and is a topic of this work .    the role of deformations in modifying the electronic structure has been investigated so far via density functional theory techniques@xcite , which predict that strain can lead to a modification to the band gap magnitude and band effective masses .",
    "these effects have also been proposed to explain optical measurements on wrinkled mos@xmath0.@xcite most dramatically it has been predicted and shown by photoluminescence experiments that strain can induce a transition between a direct and indirect band gap in monolayer mos@xmath0@xcite and multilayer wse@xmath0.@xcite additionally , as a consequence of the broken inversion symmetry of the crystal lattice the tmdcs have been shown to exhibit piezoelectric properties.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the details of the tight binding model including spin - orbit interactions but without any strain or curvature . following this , in section iii",
    "we expand the tight binding model around the high symmetry k and k@xmath1 points and obtain a low energy effective theory describing the conduction and valence bands . in section",
    "iv we introduce the corrections due to mechanical deformations and curvature of the crystal lattice , then incorporate these physical effects into the low energy effective theory , and discuss the role of these new terms in the low energy theory .",
    "finally , in section v we present our conclusions .",
    "our calculations are based on a tight binding approach describing the multiple electronic orbitals on each lattice site that makes up the tmdc within the koster - slater approach.@xcite the monolayer form of the tmdcs are comprised of three layers , two ( top and bottom ) containing only chalcogen atoms and one middle layer with only transition - metal atoms .",
    "we identify these layers by the index @xmath5 for the lower chalcogen layer , @xmath6 for the layer of transition - metal atoms , and @xmath7 for the upper chalcogen layer , a sketch of this lattice structure is shown in fig ( [ latticefig ] ) .",
    "these layers are each separated by a distance @xmath8 .",
    "the three layers comprise a planar honeycomb lattice with the top and bottom layers arranged in a triangular lattice with the top layer lying directly above the bottom layer , while the middle layer is also made of a triangular lattice rotated by @xmath9 .",
    "together these layers comprise a honeycomb lattice constructed from two sublattices ( labeled x and m ) , where the x sublattice is made of chalcogen atoms ( labeled x1 and x3 for sites on the bottom and top layer respectively ) and the m sublattice is conversely made of transition - metal atoms ( labeled m2 ) , as shown in fig .",

    "the electronic structure of the tmdcs is governed by the d - orbitals localized on the transition - metal atoms and the p - orbitals of the chalcogen atoms .",
    "studies of the electronic structure of the tmdcs by dft techniques have shown that the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum have a strong d - orbital character , while all bands with strong p - orbital character lie at higher energies.@xcite to construct a realistic tight binding model we will include both the d - orbital states and higher energy p - orbitals states .",
    "indeed , we will see later within the text that the p - orbitals are crucial for replicating the electron - hole asymmetry predicted by dft and used to explain magneto - optical experiments@xcite while also giving a complete and robust model of the effects of strain .",
    "therefore , to be fully consistent , on each m lattice site we consider 5 localized d - orbitals @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( we will denote @xmath32 as @xmath33 for notational convenience throughout this work ) , while on all x lattice sites we include the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and the @xmath36 localized p - orbitals .",
    "this creates a large basis of 11 orbitals per unit cell , but we will see that we are often able to achieve a very good approximation with a smaller basis at the high symmetry points of the brillouin zone .",
    "the tight binding hamiltonian in real space is given by three terms @xmath37 where @xmath38 describes the on - site energies of each localized orbital , @xmath39 describes the hopping between neighbor localized orbitals , and @xmath40 describes the on - site spin - orbit interactions .",
    "we express the hamiltonian in second quantization where the electron annihilation operator @xmath41 removes an electron in a p - orbital on lattice site @xmath42 in the @xmath43 localized orbital in the @xmath44-th unit cell with spin @xmath45 , while @xmath46 removes an electron in the @xmath47 localized d - orbital in the @xmath44-th unit cell with spin @xmath45 where all d - orbitals are localized on the m2 lattice sites .    at this point",
    "it is convenient to change the basis to consider symmetric and antisymmetric combinations in the layer index @xmath48 of the localized chalcogen orbitals .",
    "this is done by introducing the the new operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we will also utilize one final change of basis to the rotating orbital basis , allowing us to write the electron operators of the localized states in a form that makes their angular momentum more transparent .",
    "therefore we introduce @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the d - orbitals , while for the p - orbitals @xmath53 where the index @xmath54(@xmath55 ) refers to the angular momentum of the rotating d(p)-orbital and for the p - orbitals states @xmath56 indicate the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations in the layer index introduced above .",
    "the transition - metal dichalcogenide crystal lattice is symmetric under a mirror inversion around the central layer ( @xmath57 ) . due to this",
    "we categorize the eleven electronic states as even or odd under this mirror inversion . of the states we consider the @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 d",

    "the hopping processes between the even and odd states will be zero , unless the mirror symmetry is broken somehow , say , by a perpendicular electric field or by mechanical bending of the crystal lattice . in the following",
