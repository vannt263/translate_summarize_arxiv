    "the spectra of many classes of non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians are real and positive @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the positivity of the spectra is a consequence of @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "examples of heavily studied @xmath6-symmetric hamiltonians are @xcite @xmath7 and @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 grows with increasing @xmath10 . for hamiltonians like those in ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) the schrdinger equations for the @xmath11th eigenfunction , @xmath12 involve a complex potential and may require @xmath13 to be complex for the boundary conditions to be defined properly @xcite . thus , the schrdinger eigenvalue problems may be regarded as analytic extensions of sturm - liouville problems into the complex plane .",
    "the eigenfunctions of a conventional self - adjoint sturm - liouville problem are complete .",
    "completeness is the statement that a given function can be represented as a linear superposition of the eigenfunctions : @xmath14 it is necessary for the zeros of the eigenfunctions in the complete set to become dense on the interval in which the sturm - liouville problem is defined .",
    "if the zeros did not become dense , it would be impossible to represent a rapidly varying function @xcite .",
    "for conventional sturm - liouville problems one can prove that the zeros of successive eigenfunctions interlace , and this interlacing of the zeros ensures that the zeros become dense @xcite .",
    "a major open mathematical question for @xmath6-symmetric hamiltonians is whether the eigenfunctions form a complete set . if the zeros of the eigenfunctions of complex sturm - liouville eigenvalue problems exhibit the property of interlacing , this provides heuristic evidence that the eigenfunctions might be complete .",
    "a proof of completeness would require that we identify the space in which they are complete , and we do not yet know how to do this . nevertheless , if we can understand the distribution of the zeros of the eigenfunctions , we gain some insight into the question of completeness for eigenfunctions of @xmath0-symmetric sturm - liouville problems .",
    "we have studied three different complex @xmath6-symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "we find that in every case the qualitative features of the distribution in the complex plane of the zeros of the eigenfunctions are very similar : we observe a shifted interlacing of zeros .",
    "we believe that this pattern of zeros is universal .",
    "* example 1 : large-@xmath1 limit of the @xmath2 potential . *",
    "the large-@xmath1 limit of a @xmath2 potential is exactly solvable @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the zeros of the @xmath15th and @xmath16th eigenfunctions are plotted and clearly exhibit a form of interlacing in the complex plane . for convenience",
    ", we have scaled the zeros by dividing by the magnitude of the turning points ; we have then performed a linear transformation to fix the turning points at @xmath17 .",
    "the appropriate scaling is @xmath18    as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , the zeros of the first 15 eigenfunctions interlace and appear to become dense in a narrow region surrounding an arch - shaped contour in the complex plane .",
    "this contour is the stokes line that joins the turning points ; that is , it is the path along which the phase in the wkb quantization condition is purely real ( and thus the quantum - mechanical wave function is purely oscillatory)@xcite .",
    "( it is interesting that this wkb path differs from the path that a classical particle follows in the complex plane as it oscillates between the turning points .",
    "the path that a classical particle follows is an _ inverted _ arch - shaped contour between the same two turning points.@xcite )    * example 2 : quasi - exactly - solvable @xmath3 potential .",
    "* next , consider the quasi - exactly - solvable potential in ( [ e2 ] ) with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation have the form of an exponential multiplied by a polynomial .",
    "the zeros of this polynomial are easy to calculate numerically . for a given @xmath10 the polynomials in the eigenfunctions",
    "all have the same degree and , as a result , all of the eigenfunctions have the same number of zeros .",
    "however , for the @xmath11th wave function , @xmath21 zeros lie along the branch cut on the positive imaginary axis , and we consider these zeros to be irrelevant . for values of @xmath10 ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath23 ,",
    "the qualitative behavior is always the same . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] the results for @xmath24 are plotted and the relevant zeros again lie along the wkb paths in the complex plane . in this case the zeros",
    "are not contained in as narrow a region of the complex plane as for the @xmath2 potential because the zeros have not been scaled as in fig .",
    "the zeros have an imaginary part that becomes more negative as @xmath11 increases and exhibit the complex version of interlacing .    in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] the zeros are scaled so that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the magnitudes of the classical turning points .",
    "( the classical turning points are the roots of @xmath27 . )",
    "the scaled zeros lie in a more compact region in the complex-@xmath28 plane than the zeros in fig .",
    "we believe the zeros become dense in this region .",
    "notice that this arch - shaped region is broader than the corresponding region in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] because the turning points do not all lie along the same polar angle ; therefore , the scaling fixes the magnitudes but not the positions of the turning points . potentials with various values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 were also investigated and similar results were obtained .",
    "* example 3 : @xmath4 potential * we obtain an @xmath4 potential when we set @xmath31 in ( [ e1 ] ) . using runge - kutta techniques in the complex plane ,",
    "we have plotted the level curves of the real and imaginary parts of the complex eigenfunctions . by finding the intersections of these level curves",
    ", we have determined the zeros of the eigenfunctions numerically .",
    "these zeros , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , lie along the stokes lines of the wkb approximation .",
    "again , the zeros exhibit the complex version of interlacing .",
    "they have an imaginary part that decreases as @xmath11 increases . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] the zeros are scaled by @xmath32 , which fixes the magnitudes and positions of the turning points .",
    "this plot suggests that after the scaling the zeros become dense in the complex-@xmath28 plane . once again",
    ", this plot suggests that the distribution of zeros in the complex plane is a universal property of complex sturm - liouville eigenvalue problems associated with @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "* statement of the conjecture *    from our studies we observe that the unscaled zeros of the complex eigenfunctions do not become dense on a contour or in a narrow region of the complex-@xmath13 plane",
    ". in particular , for the @xmath4 potential wkb theory predicts that @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , where @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "thus , the turning points behave like @xmath36 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath37 using richardson extrapolation we have verified that the distance between zeros along the imaginary axis exhibits this @xmath11-dependence .",
    "consequently , the distance from the contour along which the zeros of @xmath38 lie to the contour along which the zeros of @xmath39 for large @xmath11 lie is given by @xmath40 which is infinitely far away .",
    "we have scaled the zeros by fixing the magnitudes of the turning points relative to a unit length . after this scaling is performed , the zeros appear to become dense in a narrow arch - shaped region in the scaled complex plane . if the zeros do become dense in this narrow region and exhibit the shifted complex version of interlacing , we conjecture that this behavior suggests that the eigenfunctions are complete in the scaled complex plane .",
    "since we do not know what space within which to define completeness , we are unable to give a rigorous proof .",
