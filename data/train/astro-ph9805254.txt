    "tidally generated waves can play an important role in the dynamics of gaseous disks and the tidal perturbers .",
    "the lindblad resonances ( lrs ) are important sites of wave generation in disks ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 ) .",
    "most previous studies have approximated the disk as two - dimensional ( 2d ) by ignoring effects in the vertical direction ( perpendicular to the orbit plane ) . for disks",
    "whose structure and thermodynamic response are locally vertically isothermal , the 2d approximation accurately describes the wave that is generated at an lr , which is indeed a 2d sound wave . in many cases of astrophysical interest , however , the disk is thermally stratified ( optically thick ) in the vertical direction .",
    "such cases include the planet - forming regions of protostellar disks ( bell et  al .",
    "1997 ) and cataclysmic variable ( cv ) disks ( la dous 1994 ) .    in an earlier paper ( lubow & ogilvie 1998 , hereafter paper  i ) , we analyzed the linear response of a thin , vertically polytropic disk to tidal forcing at lrs .",
    "we found that the dominant mode of excitation was the f mode of even symmetry .",
    "close to the resonance , this mode behaves compressibly and occupies the full vertical extent of the disk , like the 2d mode in an isothermal disk .",
    "however , as the wave propagates away from the resonance through a radial distance of order @xmath2 ( for resonance radius @xmath3 and azimuthal mode number @xmath0 ) , it behaves incompressibly , like a surface gravity mode , and becomes confined close to the disk surface .",
    "the degree of confinement increases with distance from the resonance . as a consequence of this wave - channeling process",
    ", there is usually a strong increase in wave amplitude with radial distance from the lr on the scale @xmath2 .",
    "although this analysis did not include damping or nonlinear effects explicitly , we estimated that shocks would sometimes develop and damp the wave .",
    "other damping mechanisms such as radiative damping ( cassen & woolum 1996 ) or viscous damping may also be of importance .    once the wave energy is channeled to a region close to the disk surface , the wave s properties are determined by the structure of the disk s outer layers .",
    "in particular , the effects of a disk atmosphere can be important .",
    "such effects are not well represented by a vertically polytropic disk . in the case of a polytrope , there is a definite surface on which the density and temperature drop to zero . with an atmosphere ,",
    "the disk density drops more gradually with height and the temperature is approximately constant .",
    "in fact , there is no actual disk surface in the isothermal case .",
    "the density falls as a gaussian with height above the mid - plane . in the limit of very high ( vertical ) optical depth in the disk ,",
    "the polytropic approximation should be adequate because the atmosphere contains an insignificant fraction of the disk s mass . in the opposite limit of an optically thin disk ,",
    "the disk structure is vertically isothermal and the wave launched at resonance behaves as a 2d sound wave .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine to consequences of a finite , non - zero optical depth on the propagation of a wave launched from an lr . for disks of optical depth of about 100 , which is thought to be typical in planet - forming regions of protostellar disks ,",
    "nearly one per cent of the disk s mass resides in the atmosphere . as a result of wave channeling",
    ", the wave energy could be contained within the atmosphere .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the consequences of a disk atmosphere on the propagational properties of the waves generated at lrs .",
    "we aim to determine whether the wave in the disk atmosphere would propagate upwards into very low density regions where shock dissipation would occur .",
    "more generally , we want to determine how much the wave amplitudes can be amplified by the wave - channeling process in the presence of a disk atmosphere as a function of disk optical depth .",
    "the semi - analytic approach taken in paper  i can be extended to include the disk atmosphere , which is modeled as an isothermal layer that extends from some height above the mid - plane outward . beneath this layer",
    "resides a thermally stratified polytropic layer which extends vertically down to the mid - plane . for convenience ,",
    "we treat the transition as abrupt , although in reality it may occur over a distance comparable to a scale height .",
    "as will be shown , physical solutions to the wave equation in the isothermal layer can be obtained analytically .",
    "the upper boundary condition of the isothermal layer is that no waves carry energy from great distances above the disk mid - plane downwards toward the mid - plane .",
    "that is , there are no external sources of energy above the disk .",
    "the solutions allow for the possibility of reflection in the disk atmosphere and propagation to great ( or infinite ) heights in the atmosphere .",
    "these atmospheric solutions contain some freedom that needs to be constrained by the underlying polytropic layer .",
    "the isothermal solutions provide constraints that serve as an outer boundary condition for the numerical solution of the wave equations in the polytropic layer . taken together , vertically global solutions are obtained that connect the two layers in a physically meaningful manner .",
    "the ratio of the temperature at mid - plane to the temperature at the layer interface determines the disk optical depth through the @xmath4@xmath5 relation .",
    "the disk is considered to be a steady , axisymmetric fluid rotating in a constant , axisymmetric gravitational potential . referred to cylindrical polar",
    "coordinates @xmath6 , the fluid has angular velocity @xmath7 , density @xmath8 , and pressure @xmath9 , while the gravitational potential is @xmath10 . the disk is considered to be thin , so that the angular velocity can be considered independent of @xmath11 and given by @xmath12 while the epicyclic frequency @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 the effective gravitational acceleration is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the vertical frequency given by @xmath18 in particular , we will be interested in a keplerian disk about a spherical mass @xmath19 , for which the potential is @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "however , the notational distinction between @xmath22 , @xmath13 , and @xmath23 is retained , partly to aid the interpretation of the equations in the case of a keplerian disk , and partly to allow a generalization to non - keplerian disks .",
    "the local vertical equilibrium of the disk is determined by the equation @xmath24 the buoyancy frequency @xmath25 of vertical oscillations is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the adiabatic exponent . throughout this paper ,",
    "the self - gravitation of the fluid , its viscosity , and the accretion flow are neglected .    in order to model a disk of finite optical depth",
    ", we assume that the pressure and density are related by a polytropic relation , @xmath28 in a central layer @xmath29 containing the mid - plane , and by an isothermal relation , @xmath30 in the outer layers @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are the density and pressure on the mid - plane , and @xmath36 is the isothermal scale height .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is the height at which the polytropic layer would reach zero density and pressure if it were not truncated , and is given by @xmath38 furthermore , the relation @xmath39 holds , because @xmath40 is continuous at the interface .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 is a measure of the ` weighting ' assigned to the polytropic layer in this mixed model .",
    "the ratio of the temperature of the isothermal layer to the temperature at the mid - plane ( for an ideal gas ) is @xmath42 this may be expressed in terms of an approximate effective optical depth @xmath5 at the mid - plane according to the relation ( e.g.  bell et  al .",
    "1997 ) @xmath43 which gives @xmath44    the ratio @xmath45 of the surface densities of the two layers can be expressed in terms of @xmath41 , but only by using higher transcendental functions .",
    "we assume that the effective adiabatic exponent @xmath27 is constant and greater than unity in the central layer , but equal to unity in the outer layers .",
    "this reflects the fact that the thermal time - scale is short compared to the dynamical time - scale in the isothermal layers .",
    "the buoyancy frequency may then be evaluated as @xmath46 \\left({{2z^2}\\over{h_s^2-z^2}}\\right)\\omega_\\perp^2,\\\\ \\hskip-0.5cm|z|>z_1:&&\\hskip-0.5 cm n^2=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and is discontinuous at @xmath47 .",
    "the equations governing free , linear waves in a thin accretion disk have been derived and solved in different cases by lubow & pringle ( 1993 , hereafter lp ) , korycansky & pringle ( 1995 ) , ogilvie ( 1998 ) , and in paper  i. the separation of scales between the horizontal and vertical directions allows all wave quantities to be expressed as wkb functions in @xmath48 , except in the neighborhood of resonances , which are also turning points for the waves .",

    "this is compared with the dispersion relation for a purely polytropic disk and also with the limiting form given by equation ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the purely polytropic dispersion relation provides a good approximation until the wave action of the mode migrates into the atmosphere , at which point the approximation given by equation ( [ eq12 ] ) becomes good . the value of @xmath167 at which this transition occurs increases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "note that the eigenvalue @xmath120 is a negative number whose magnitude increases with increasing @xmath5 . according to the correspondence @xmath168",
    ", this means that , in an optically thick disk , the atmospheric part of the eigenfunction of the @xmath131 mode does not resemble the 2d mode of a purely isothermal disk , but is more like the tail of a high - order p mode after its final node .",
    "we now consider the propagation of the @xmath131 mode away from an lr , as in paper  i. away from the resonance , the radial flux of angular momentum associated with the wave ( averaged over @xmath169 , integrated over @xmath170 and @xmath11 ) , @xmath171 is independent of @xmath48 , and this condition determines the relative normalization of the wave at each radius .",
    "our method of estimating the nonlinearity of the wave at each radius is to locate the value of @xmath11 at which the peak of the density of angular momentum wave action ( averaged over @xmath169 ) , @xmath172 occurs , and to compute the ( isothermal ) mach number of the rms velocity perturbation , @xmath173^{1/2},\\ ] ] at that height .",
    "since this measure depends on the overall amplitude of the wave , we normalize it in terms of its value at the resonance as follows .",
    "in the neighborhood of the lr , the horizontal components of the velocity dominate , and the peak of the wave action density occurs on @xmath62 .",

    "we have also assumed that @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "this variation of parameters was selected so that the wave mach number would be finite at the radial center of the disk . in this way ,",
    "we have removed geometrical focusing effects from the wave - channeling effects of interest in this paper .    in figure  2",
    "we plot the variation with @xmath48 of the height @xmath191 of the local vertical peak in the wave action density .",
    "we consider both inward propagation from the inner lr and outward propagation from the outer lr ; we consider azimuthal wave numbers @xmath192 and @xmath193 ; and we consider the four models with different optical depths . in figure  3",
    "we plot the quantity in equation ( [ eq14 ] ) for each of these cases .",
    "as figure  2 shows , the f mode is launched at resonance with the peak of wave action density located at the mid - plane and the peak rises away from the mid - plane as it propagates away from the resonance .",
    "when @xmath194 reaches the base of the atmosphere , it resides there over a non - zero interval in radius , as is apparent in figure  2 by the flat slope of the curves .",
    "this discontinuous behavior of the slope is caused by our idealization of the transition from the polytropic interior to the isothermal atmosphere as occurring abruptly in the vertical direction .",
    "notice that the rise of @xmath194 with distance from the resonance increases with optical depth .",
    "however , the peak never rises to great heights in the atmosphere .",
    "figure  4 shows how the wave action density is distributed vertically .",
    "we have verified that the waves are not artificially confined within the disk in our model , either by the discontinuity in the sound speed at the interface ( which results from a change in the effective adiabatic exponent ) or by the discontinuity in the buoyancy frequency .",
    "if the isothermal layer is treated as having an adiabatic exponent equal to that of the polytropic layer , so that the sound speed is everywhere continuous , the wave migrates into the atmosphere at nearly the same stage during the radial propagation .",
    "the peak of the wave action density rises only slightly higher than in the case of a truly isothermal atmosphere .",
    "if , instead , the disk is treated as adiabatically stratified in both layers , so that the buoyancy frequency is everywhere continuous ( and zero ) , the results are almost indistinguishable from those we have presented here .",
    "we emphasize that radially propagating waves in an accretion disk are generically confined in the vertical direction because the vertical gravity increases with height above the mid - plane .",
    "we have analyzed the effects of a disk atmosphere on the propagation of a wave , the f mode , launched from a lindblad resonance in a thermally stratified disk .",
    "the atmosphere was modeled as an isothermal layer that resides above a polytropic region that extends down to the mid - plane .",
    "the polytropic region represents the ( vertically ) optically thick interior of the disk .",
    "the effects of the atmosphere can be important because the f mode becomes progressively more confined to the disk surface with distance from resonance .",
    "the wave energy is concentrated in the vertical direction as the wave propagates radially ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the peak of wave action density in the disk follows the trajectories shown in figure 2 for various values of azimuthal wavenumber @xmath0 and disk optical depth @xmath5 .",
    "the dominant amplification of a wave occurs in the thermally stratified region below the disk atmosphere through the process of wave channeling , as was anticipated in paper i ( see the discussion in  8.2 ) .",
    "the disk atmosphere lessens the degree of wave amplification .    as was found in paper i , the launched wave ( f mode ) behaves more like a surface gravity wave as it propagates radially away from the resonance . in a purely vertically polytropic disk with no atmosphere",
    ", the vertical extent of the surface gravity wave decreases with increasing radial distance from resonance . as a result",
    ", there is usually a substantial increase in wave amplitude on a radial scale of order @xmath2 from resonance , through a process termed wave channeling . in the presence of an atmosphere ,",
    "the effects of wave channeling are lessened ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the increase in wave amplitude becomes limited once the wave enters the disk atmosphere . for disks of smaller optical depths ,",
    "the thermal stratification is small and the wave enters the isothermal layer on a radial scale somewhat smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , the wave behaves more like the 2d acoustic mode at most radii , in accordance with the expected limiting behavior of a vertically isothermal disk , in which the wave is 2d at all radii and its peak never rises above the mid - plane .    for disks around individual stars ( circumstellar disks ) in close binary star systems ( @xmath195 ) ,",
    "the increase in wave mach number from resonance to disk center is typically less than a factor of 10 , and somewhat less for lower optical depths ( see figure 3a ) . for disks around binary star systems ( circumbinary disks ) ( @xmath195 ) the increase in wave mach number from resonance is large over a scale of order the resonance radius ( see figure 3c ) . for waves that are mildly nonlinear at resonance ,",
    "nonlinear wave damping is likely to be important in such disks of modest vertical optical depth ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "these effects are much stronger for circumbinary , rather than circumstellar disks .    for protostellar disks ( @xmath197 , see figure 3b and 4b ) , planet - forming regions are expected to be optically thick ( bell et  al .",
    "typical wave velocities near a giant planet are likely to be mildly supersonic , with mach number around 0.2 ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 ) . in such a situation ,",
    "wave channeling would likely lead to shocks for disks of moderate optical depths ( of order 100 ) on a radial scale of a few times the disk thickness .",
    "we emphasize that the detailed nonlinear outcome of the wave - channeling process remains uncertain .",
    "while the wave action is concentrated in the polytropic layer , the motion is approximately incompressible , but this is no longer true once the wave migrates into the atmosphere , where shocks may limit the amplitude .",
    "for this reason we have used the mach number of the wave motion as a measure of nonlinearity .",
    "the development of shocks or other nonlinear wave phenomena under these circumstances could be usefully investigated using numerical simulations .",

    "<S> we extend our analysis of the three - dimensional response of a vertically polytropic disk to tidal forcing at lindblad resonances by including the effects of a disk atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the atmosphere is modeled as an isothermal layer that joins smoothly on to an underlying polytropic layer . </S>",
    "<S> the launched wave progressively enters the atmosphere as it propagates away from the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the wave never propagates vertically , however , and the wave energy rises to a ( finite ) characteristic height in the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of wave amplitude associated with this process of wave channeling is reduced by the effect of the atmosphere . for waves of large azimuthal mode number @xmath0 generated by giant planets embedded in a disk , </S>",
    "<S> the increase in wave amplitude is still substantial enough to be likely to dissipate the wave energy by shocks for even modest optical depths ( @xmath1 ) over a radial distance of a few times the disk thickness . for low-@xmath0 waves generated in circumstellar disks in binary stars , the effects of wave channeling are less important and the level of wave nonlinearity increases by less than a factor of 10 in going from the disk edge to the disk center . for circumbinary disks , </S>",
    "<S> the effects of wave channeling remain important , even for modest values of optical depth . </S>"
