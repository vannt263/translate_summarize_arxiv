    "while prompt photons really are perturbative , and pion decay photons can be calibrated from other hadronic signals , the most interesting signal , photon production from the medium , suffers from the usual problem that we only have weak coupling calculations @xcite for qgp photon production , despite the fact that the medium is probably strongly coupled .",
    "therefore , any guidance on the behavior of photon production as a function of coupling would be useful , even if it comes from an analogue theory which is not quite real qcd . with this in mind",
