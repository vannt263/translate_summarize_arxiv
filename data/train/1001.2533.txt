    "to begin with , let us give a simple example of a spider .",
    "imagine there are two particles performing nearest neighbor random walks on @xmath1 in continuous time .",
    "these particles are tied together with a rope of a certain length @xmath8 . as long as the rope is not tight their movements are independent .",
    "if the rope is tight ( the two particles are at a distance @xmath9 from each other ) the rope prevents the particles to jump _ away _ from each other .    in these notes , we consider a spider on @xmath1 in a random environment .",
    "first , suppose that @xmath10 is a sequence of positive i.i.d .",
    "random variables taking values in @xmath11 .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the distribution of @xmath13 and by @xmath14 the corresponding expectation . in the example",
    "above , we first choose an environment @xmath13 at random according to the law @xmath12 and we describe the position of our two particles by the vector @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , is the position of particle @xmath18 at time @xmath19 . as long as @xmath20 , the two particles behave like two independent random walks in random environment .",
    "if @xmath21 , their movements are dependent in order to prevent that @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , let the first particle be in @xmath23 and the second in @xmath24 . then , if @xmath25 the first particle jumps to @xmath26 with rate @xmath27 or to site @xmath28 with rate @xmath29 .",
    "analogously the second one moves to @xmath30 with rate @xmath31 or to site @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 and @xmath35 the first leg may only jump to the right with rate @xmath36 and the second to the left with rate @xmath33 . in the case @xmath35 the roles of the two legs are interchanged .",
    "more generally we can consider a spider with @xmath0 legs , that is to say @xmath0 interacting particles .",
    "the particles move independently as long as their movement does not violate some restriction rules concerning their positions . in this case",
    "we denote by @xmath37 the positions of the @xmath0 particles at time @xmath19 where @xmath16 represents the position of particle @xmath18 at time @xmath19 .",
    "this model gained recently an interest in evolutionary dynamics and molecular cybernetics . at the moment , to our knowledge , there are just a few theoretical papers on this model . in  @xcite ,",
    "antal , krapivsky and mallick obtained the speed and diffusion constants for 1-dimensional spiders and in  @xcite antal and krapivsky made the first study for non - markovian spiders . in  @xcite ,",
    "gallesco , mller and popov study qualitative properties , as recurrence , transience , ergodicity and positive rate of escape of spiders in a quite general setting .",
    "we refer to the lecture notes of zeitouni  @xcite for a general overview on random walks in random environments ( rwre ) .",
    "the main result of this paper , theorem  [ theo1 ] , is that in random environment on @xmath1 the speed of a spider may be zero even if the speed of a ( single ) rwre is positive .",
    "this is in contrast with the results in  @xcite and in section 4.1 of  @xcite that the positive speed of a homogeneous random walk implies positive speed of the spider .",
    "it is convenient to adopt the following notations of  @xcite .",
    "recall that the spider is described through @xmath38 .",
    "the first leg defines the position of the spider : the position of the spider at time @xmath19 is @xmath39 .",
    "the spider is defined through a set @xmath40 of local configurations at @xmath41 , that is a finite subset of @xmath42 .",
    "actually , the set @xmath40 corresponds to all possible configurations for the spider at position @xmath41 . since in this note",
    "we only consider transitive spiders the set of local configurations at position @xmath43 ( that is when @xmath44 ) can be obtained by translating the set @xmath40 by @xmath43 . denoting by @xmath45 the shift by @xmath43 ,",
    "we have @xmath46 let @xmath47 for elements in @xmath48 we write @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the transition rates @xmath51 of the spider are defined as follows : let @xmath52 then    * if @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is the usual @xmath55-norm ) and @xmath18 is the coordinate such that @xmath56 , @xmath57 * otherwise , @xmath58    now , following @xcite , we define the spider graph",
    ". for a given realization @xmath13 of our environment , define the graph @xmath59 such that an edge @xmath60 belongs to @xmath61 if and only if @xmath62 . as the sequence @xmath13 takes values in @xmath63 ,",
    "the spider graph is deterministic . in the rest of these notes",
    "we will assume the irreducibility of the spider walk which is implied by the two following conditions on @xmath64 for almost all realizations of @xmath13 :    * @xmath40 is a connected subgraph of the spider graph @xmath64 , * there exists at least one edge between @xmath40 and @xmath65 .    condition ( i ) is not necessary for the irreducibility of the spider , nevertheless it is assumed in this stronger form to reduce the technical part of the proofs .",

    "is the usual uniform ellipticity condition .",
    "condition ( v ) corresponds to the fact that our environment is nestling . observe that for non - nestling random environments it is possible to show that every spider , satisfying ( i)+(ii ) , has positive speed .",
    "furthermore , conditions ( iii)-(v ) imply that there exists a unique @xmath72 , such that @xmath73 = 1.\\ ] ]    we denote by @xmath74 the quenched law of the spider starting at @xmath75 in the environment @xmath13 and by @xmath76 the corresponding expectation .",
    "finally , we denote by @xmath77 and @xmath78 the annealed probability and expectation for the spider starting at @xmath75 .",
    "we define the speed of a spider as @xmath79 if the limit exists .",
    "let us consider a spider starting at some initial position @xmath80 and define the stopping time @xmath81 the main result of these notes is the following theorem .",
    "[ theo1 ] consider a spider with @xmath0 legs . under conditions ( i)-(v ) , the speed @xmath82 of the spider is well - defined and we have @xmath83-a.s .",

    "our technique is not fine enough to deal with the critical case @xmath86 .",
    "nevertheless , we are inclined to believe that in this case , independently of the set @xmath40 , the speed of the spider should be zero .",
    "we will denote by @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 the `` important '' constants ( those that can be used far away from the place where they appear for the first time ) and by @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath89 the `` local '' ones ( those that are used only in a small neighbourhood of the place where they appear for the first time ) , restarting the numeration at the beginning of each section in the latter case .",
    "an important ingredient of our proofs is the analysis of the potential associated to the environment , which was introduced by sinai in @xcite .",
    "the potential , denoted by @xmath92 is a function of the environment and is defined as follows : @xmath93      let us first give an example to illustrate the construction of the spider graph @xmath64 . consider a spider with 3 legs , that is @xmath94 , and the following set @xmath40 of restrictions : @xmath95 figure [ fig1 ] shows the set of local configurations and a part of the spider graph @xmath64 . in the spider graph",
    ", the horizontal axis corresponds to the positions of the spider and the vertical axis to the local configurations .",
    "while the spider graph is deterministic the transition rates associated to each edge of @xmath64 depend on the realization @xmath13 of our random environment .",
    "now , given a couple @xmath96 , consider the continuous time markov process @xmath97 on the spider graph @xmath64 .",
    "observe that we use the same notation @xmath98 for two different processes : the spider on @xmath99 and the markov process on @xmath64 .",
    "it should always be clear from the context to which of these we are referring to .",

    "using condition ( iv ) we obtain that for all @xmath105 @xmath106 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 two positive constants and @xmath107 using these inequalities and the fact that @xmath40 is finite , we obtain that there exists two finite positive constants @xmath108 and @xmath109 such that @xmath110 for all @xmath104 .",

    "moreover as the graph @xmath116 is finite we can normalize the reversible measure ( [ revmesinf ] ) to obtain the invariant probability measure @xmath118 of @xmath115 , @xmath119 for all @xmath120 .",
    "solomon showed in @xcite that , under condition ( iii ) , a single random walk is @xmath83-a.s.transient to @xmath121 .",
