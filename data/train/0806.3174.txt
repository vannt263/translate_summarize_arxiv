    ", width=340 ]",
    "the basic assumption underlying our work is that a description of gluelumps and glueballs in terms of states with a given number of constituent gluons is relevant , or at least that it can be a satisfactory approximation of what these gluonic hadrons exactly are .",
    "the idea that low - energy qcd allows for an effective description of hadrons as bound states of constituent particles is not new : the classification of baryons and mesons with the quark hypothesis is a first historical example of the viability of such a picture .",
    "however , there should exist a way to connect the constituent approaches to qcd . to our knowledge , this longstanding problem is far from being completely solved , but interesting results have been obtained within different frameworks .",
    "we recall some of these approaches and comments on them in the following .",
    "first , we turn our attention to large-@xmath5 su(@xmath5)-gauge theories , where @xmath5 is the number of colors .",
    "the @xmath6 expansion in qcd , valid in particular at low energy , has revealed itself to be a powerful tool which has played an important role in numerous theoretical aspects of qcd ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for useful references ) . in the limit where the number of colors becomes very large",
    ", it has been shown that the description of baryons , made of @xmath5 valence quarks , becomes simpler @xcite .",
    "model independent mass formulae can be obtained within this framework and lead to a very accurate description of experimentally known baryons , either light or heavy @xcite ; thus the large-@xmath5 limit appears to capture the essential features of qcd , which is characterized by  only \" @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , it has recently been shown that the mass formulae obtained from a constituent quark model are in remarkable agreement with those arising from the large-@xmath5 expansion in the light baryon sector @xcite .",
    "this comforts the constituent quark picture in the most difficult cases , when light ( even massless ) quarks are present .",
    "of importance for our purpose is the recent observation that the number of valence gluons is a good quantum number for glueballs in the large-@xmath5 limit @xcite . by analogy with the baryons",
    ", this suggests that the fock space expansion of glueballs at @xmath7 is dominated by a particular component , characterized by its number of constituent gluons . in this spirit , the present work could be seen as an attempt to identify these dominant components for each known glueball and gluelump .",
    "second , we can get useful informations from coulomb gauge qcd @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the qcd hamiltonian is written with the gluonic field in the coulomb gauge .",
    "a key feature of this gauge is that the elimination of the nondynamical degrees of freedom creates an instantaneous nonperturbative interaction .",
    "properties of low - energy hadronic states are eventually computed from this hamiltonian and the fock space in which these states are defined is expanded on a quasiparticle basis , either quarks or gluons .",
    "a general property of hadronic states is then that their fock space expansion converges quickly .",
    "this leads to a connection with constituent models since , again , it seems relevant to assume that a fixed given number of valence quarks or gluons can be associated with a given hadron .",
    "the notion of an instantaneous confining potential also naturally emerges from coulomb gauge qcd .",
    "the connections between constituent quark models and coulomb gauge qcd have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite while glueballs are studied in refs .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in these last works , the low - lying glueballs are successfully described in terms of two - transverse gluon bound states , with a negligible three - gluon component .",
    "these conclusions are shared by the recent results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where pure two - transverse gluon bound states have been shown to accurately reproduce the lattice qcd and coulomb gauge qcd data .",
    "in coulomb gauge qcd as in many potential models , the constituent particles have a particular status since they are confined .",
    "in particular they gain a constituent mass , different from their bare mass , because of the confining interaction .",
    "one can look in particular at the coulomb gauge study of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that constituent gluons , although having a zero bare mass , gain a running constituent mass which is about @xmath8  gev at zero momentum .",
    "they become then distinguishable from the exchanged gluons , which mediate the interaction without being themselves confined .    an effective qcd hamiltonian for various hadronic systems",
    "can also be derived from the field correlator method @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the picture of constituent particles ( quarks or gluons ) linked by color flux tubes emerges naturally .",
    "for instance , the constituent mass of the confined gluons is defined as @xmath9 , that is their average kinetic energy .",
    "interestingly , this quantity is also typically of about 0.7  gev for the glueball ground state .",
    "we have just shown that several effective approaches of low - energy qcd agree with the constituent gluon picture for glueballs .",
    "even if the fock space expansion of a glueball or gluelump may be nontrivial , these models actually suggest that one component with a given number of valence gluons may be dominant .",
    "now we make some comments on the correlator method , that allows to compute glueball masses in lattice qcd for example @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the initial state ( at zero euclidian time ) @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an operator creating a glueball or a gluelump out of the qcd vacuum @xmath12 , and where @xmath13 denotes the irrep corresponding to particular @xmath14 quantum numbers .",
    "although highly nontrivial , the evolution of this state is computable , with lattice methods in particular @xcite . after a time @xmath15 one gets the state @xmath16 , and the correlator @xmath17 can be evaluated .",
    "as intuitively expected , @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the mass of the lightest state which can be created by the operator @xmath20 .",
    "examples of such operators are given in table  [ tabop ] .",
    "a rule giving the mass hierarchy of glueballs has been formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite : the higher the mass dimension of an operator is , the heavier the resulting hadron is .",
    "for example , the lowest @xmath21 gluelump operator has dimension @xmath22 , while the first @xmath23 and @xmath21 glueballs have dimension 4 and 6 respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the observed lattice qcd mass hierarchy follows this dimension rule .",
    "there are two ways of increasing the dimension of an operator : either to increase the order of the operator in the chromo - electric or -magnetic fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , or to add a covariant derivative @xmath26 ( as in the @xmath27 gluelump ) .",
    "both ways have a very natural explanation within a constituent gluon picture .",
    "indeed , a transverse gluon creator is contained in each @xmath24 or @xmath25 factor .",
    "assuming thus that each such factor generates a constituent gluon , we find that gluelumps are made of a single constituent gluon , and that they are logically lighter than glueballs , which are made of at least two constituent gluons .",
    "another illustration of this interpretation is that a @xmath4-odd glueball can be created with at least a cubic expression in the fields : as possible three - gluon states , they logically appear to be heavier than two - gluon states . within this picture",
    ", the addition of totally symmetrized covariant derivatives does not affect the number of constituent gluons , but adds momentum : the covariant derivative rather generates excitations of the considered few - gluon system @xcite .",
    "even if @xmath28 can be seen as a state with a given number of constituent gluons , because it is created by operators such as those of table  [ tabop ] , the final physical state @xmath29 could have a far more complicated fock space expansion due to the complex qcd interactions that come into play .",
    "but , as mentioned above , this does not seem to be the case . at this stage",
    "a connection with potential models can be made : they all rely on the assumption that it is possible to find an appropriate effective potential satisfactory reproducing the properties of physical hadrons ( @xmath30 ) seen as systems of constituent particles ( @xmath31 ) interacting _ via _ this effective potential .",
    "to conclude , it is worth mentioning the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that the lattice qcd @xmath23 glueball wave function is compatible with the wave function of a flux tube hamiltonian of the form @xmath32 in the @xmath23 channel .",
    "we recover the idea that the scalar glueball can be seen as a dominantly two - gluon state , where the two constituent gluons ( @xmath33 ) interact _ via _ the effective potential @xmath34 .",
    ".examples of operators creating glueballs and gluelumps with a given @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath35 denote a complete symmetrization .",
    "the repeated color indices @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are intended to be summed and the superscripts @xmath39 , @xmath40 are space indices . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,<,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab1 ]",
    "we have observed through the previous sections that the different lowest - lying one- , two- , three- and four - gluon states can be separated into glueballs with natural parity or unnatural parity .",
    "the corresponding low - lying glueballs that are currently observed in lattice qcd are listed in table .",
    "the left part is concerned with the natural parity glueballs ( @xmath41 ) while the right part is concerned with the unnatural parity states ( @xmath42 ) . in order to explain the mass hierarchy of these states",
    ", we define the spin - averaged mass as usual by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mass of the glueball which is a @xmath45-gluon candidate with @xmath14 quantum numbers .",
    "the case @xmath46 is the gluelump case , while @xmath47 corresponds to glueballs .",
    "it appears that the spin - averaged masses grow linearly with the presumed number of constituent gluons ; we then propose to fit the data of table  [ tab1 ] with the following form @xmath48 a linear regression on the natural parity states leads to @xmath49 as it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , formula  ( [ mav2 ] ) with the fitted values  ( [ param ] ) reproduces rather well the spin - averaged masses .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this last mass formula predicts a @xmath50 four - gluon glueball in the mass range @xmath51 .     versus the presumed number of constituent gluons .",
    "equation  ( [ mav2 ] ) is plotted with the optimal values  ( [ param ] ) for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    ", width=321 ]    formula  ( [ mav2 ] ) actually gives support to the constituent gluon picture , each constituent gluon roughly bringing to the total glueball mass an amount which is equal to @xmath52 .",
    "additional mechanisms ( instanton - induced interactions , spin - dependent forces , etc . ) are expected to come into play as higher - order terms and are all contained in the @xmath54 term .",
    "if the particular value of @xmath53 probably needs a very accurate model to be understood , @xmath52 can be obtained within the framework of the flux tube model .",
    "indeed , @xmath52 can be simply obtained from formula  ( [ mav2 ] ) @xmath55.\\ ] ] the most simple case is the gluelump one , for which @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath52 is then related to a typical gluelump mass , that can be obtained from a gluelump hamiltonian in the flux tube model . at the dominant order",
    ", it reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are conjugate variables and where @xmath59 is the separation between the constituent gluon and the static source .",
    "it is spin - independent but , in our formalism , the effect of the gluons helicity is included at the level of the wave functions , not in the hamiltonian itself .",
    "although we do not use an explicitly covariant formalism , the semirelativistic kinetic term @xmath60 should be relevant to describe the dynamics of the constituent gluon .",
    "@xmath36 is the energy density of the flux tube linking this gluon to the static source , and @xmath61 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the flux tube actually comes from the nonperturbative part of the qcd interactions and generates the confinement , while the coulomb part is the dominant part of the one - gluon - exchange potential between the constituent gluon and the static source @xcite .",
    "assuming the casimir scaling hypothesis , one can write @xmath62 with @xmath63 the energy density of the flux tube in a meson . in order to compare our results with lattice qcd",
    ", we can define @xmath64 , and work with the new coordinates @xmath65 and @xmath66 . then",

    "( [ bgdef ] ) and table  [ tab1 ] , @xmath52 should be given by @xmath68 , both masses being computed from this last hamiltonian . as mentioned in sec .",

    "one gets , after a numerical evaluation , @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "this value of the strong coupling constant is quite usual in potential models .",
    "this achieves to clarify the physical content of the coefficient @xmath52 .",
    "an important point to stress is that , in a usual , spin - based model , the lowest allowed value for @xmath80 is 0 and would lead to the conclusion that @xmath52 has to be identified with @xmath81 .",

    "@xmath52 can be computed from the eigenstates of hamiltonian  ( [ gl3 ] ) . in particular , the knowledge of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 glueball masses finally lead us to a well - defined value for @xmath52 .",

    "a confirmation of this point is then important , in particular by performing a quite crude but physically relevant four - body calculation of the @xmath0 mass within a constituent gluon approach and the helicity formalism .      as in hamiltonians used above",

    "it was suggested in the recent lattice qcd studies of refs .",
    "@xcite that the less energetic configuration for many - gluon systems ( more than two ) is the one in which each constituent gluon is linked to its two nearest neighbors by two fundamental flux tubes .",
    "phenomenological arguments also support this picture @xcite . in agreement with this idea , we suggest that the hamiltonian describing a glueball made of four gluons is given at the dominant order by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the position and momentum of particle @xmath39 respectively .",

    "however , it has be shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the relativistic corrections to bring to the confining potential are proportional to two color factors .",
    "one of them is a projector on a color octet state and vanishes in our case because a gluon pair is always in a color ( anti)decuplet .",
    "the other color factor also vanishes because it is proportional to @xmath95 , which vanishes in the color ( anti)decuplet channel . remarkably , the few physical ingredients that have been put in hamiltonian  ( [ mainh ] ) appear to be enough to accurately describe the @xmath0 glueball thanks to the vanishing of the relativistic corrections in this case .",

    "the glueball mass we look for should _ a priori _ be numerically computed from hamiltonian  ( [ mainh ] ) . a full four - body calculation with such a semirelativistic hamiltonian is a very difficult task in itself , but here the situation is even worse because the helicity formalism imposes non standard values for the matrix elements of the orbital angular momentum .",

    "these are actually the @xmath144^{\\bm 8_a},\\bm 8]^{\\bm 1_a}$ ] and @xmath144^{\\bm 8_s},\\bm 8]^{\\bm 1_s}$ ] configurations respectively .",
    "it can then be computed that @xmath145\\tilde a_\\rho)={\\rm tr}(\\left[a_\\mu , a_\\nu\\right]a_\\rho)\\rightarrow c=+,\\ ] ] @xmath146 these configurations have the permutation symmetries @xmath147 $ ] and @xmath148 respectively .",
    "the case of four gluons is a little bit more involved .",
    "let us first focus on the particular color wave functions in which the gluon pairs are in a color octet .",
    "the following combinations lead to a color singlet : @xmath149[a_\\rho , a_\\sigma])$ ] , @xmath150 , and @xmath151\\{a_\\rho , a_\\sigma\\})$ ] .",
    "they correspond respectively to the color wave functions @xmath89^{\\bm",
    "8_a},[\\bm 8,\\bm 8]^{\\bm 8_a}]^{\\bm 1}$ ] , @xmath89^{\\bm 8_a},[\\bm 8,\\bm 8]^{\\bm 8_s}]^{\\bm 1}$ ] , and @xmath89^{\\bm 8_s},[\\bm",
    "8,\\bm 8]^{\\bm 8_s}]^{\\bm 1}$ ] . as previously",
    ", the @xmath4-parity can be computed .",
    "first , @xmath145[\\tilde a_\\rho,\\tilde a_\\sigma])={\\rm tr}([a_\\mu , a_\\nu][a_\\rho , a_\\sigma])\\rightarrow c=+,\\ ] ] with a permutation symmetry that can be of the form @xmath152 only , the total antisymmetry @xmath153 $ ] being excluded by virtue of the jacobi identity .",
    "second , we have @xmath154 with a permutation symmetry that can be of the form @xmath155 or @xmath156 .",
    "the only configuration that can lead to a negative @xmath4-parity actually is @xmath145\\{\\tilde a_\\rho,\\tilde a_\\sigma\\})=-{\\rm tr}([a_\\mu , a_\\nu]\\{a_\\rho , a_\\sigma\\})\\rightarrow c=-.\\ ] ] _ a priori _ , both the permutation symmetries @xmath157 and @xmath158 are allowed , but the equality @xmath159 forbids the @xmath157 symmetry .",
    "the last equality just reflects the obvious fact that , for any three given matrices @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the following identity holds @xmath163+[b,\\{a , c\\}]+[c,\\{a , b\\}]= 0 $ ] .",
    "the two remaining four - gluon color wave functions are now @xmath89^{\\overline{\\bm{10}}_a } , [ \\bm 8,\\bm 8]^{\\bm { 10}_a}]^{\\bm{1}}$ ] and @xmath89^{\\bm{27}_s},[\\bm 8,\\bm 8]^{\\bm { 27}_s}]^{\\bm{1}}$ ] .",
    "the study of these configurations can be achieved by building the various representations we need from bilinear quantities in the fundamental irreducible representation of @xmath128 and its conjugated , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , using @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "let us take a complex 3-vector @xmath167 and its complex conjugated @xmath168 transforming in the @xmath164 and @xmath169 representations respectively , where @xmath170 , and impose the vanishing of the trace @xmath171 .",
    "then , @xmath172 defines an anti - hermitian traceless @xmath173 matrix , therefore transforming in the adjoint irrep of @xmath128 , @xmath174 @xmath175 .",
    "this relation is actually related to eq .",
    "( [ cconj ] ) .",
    "note that the dual irreps of @xmath176 are equivalent to the complex conjugated ones , implying for @xmath177 that @xmath178 } } \\simeq a_i\\ , b_j \\,\\varepsilon^{ijk}\\ ] ] belongs to the @xmath179 representation , the symbol @xmath180 meaning ` isomorphic to ' .",
    "the tensor product @xmath181 can then be performed explicitly , giving the well - known result @xmath182 where the permutation symmetry , i.e. symmetric ( @xmath183 ) or antisymmetric ( @xmath36 ) , of all the representations have explicitly been written .",
    "starting from @xmath184 , the left - hand - side of the above relation , we find the correct decomposition with @xmath185 } } \\ ; , \\quad \\bm { 10}_a \\simeq { u}_{(m}^{_{[a , b]}}{a}_{j}{b}_{l ) } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\bm { 27}_s & \\simeq & \\widehat{x}^{ik}_{jl}(a , b)\\equiv x^{ik}_{jl}(a , b ) - \\frac{1}{5}\\ , \\delta^{(i}_{(j } \\widehat{y}^{k)}_{\\;l)}(a , b )   - \\frac{1}{12}\\ , \\delta^{(i}_{(j } \\delta^{k)}_{l)}\\,z(a , b)\\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "the action of the @xmath4-parity on all these irreducible representations is particularly simple : it lowers ( raises ) the upper ( lower ) indices and removes ( adds ) bars accordingly .",
    "for example , @xmath188 is changed into @xmath189 .",
    "it is readily checked that the @xmath190 has a positive @xmath4-parity , and that all the previous results concerning four gluons are recovered . in the case of a four - gluon system ,",
    "the decomposition  ( [ decomp2 ] ) tells us that two singlets can be obtained for gluon pairs in @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "these are given by @xmath193}_{(m}a_j b_{l ) } \\bar{u}^{(m}_{[c , d]}\\bar c^j\\bar{d}^{l)}\\pm \\bar{u}_{[a , b]}^{(m } \\bar{a}^j \\bar{b}^{l ) } u_{(m}^{[c , d ] } c_j d_{l)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this last line can be used to check that the @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) singlet has a positive ( negative ) @xmath4-parity . finally , their permutation symmetry is of @xmath196 type .",
    "the configurations involving the @xmath197 representation generate repulsive forces between the gluons .",
    "they will necessarily lead to heavy glueballs and will consequently not be studied here , were attention is drawn on low - lying states .",
    "a few comments can be done concerning gluelumps .",
    "the color octet source can actually be seen as a color scalar particle @xmath198 such that @xmath199 .",
    "then , a one - gluon gluelump corresponds to @xmath200 , and it is easily checked that the @xmath4-parity of such a state is always negative . for two - gluon gluelumps , one can further compute that @xmath3 ( @xmath201 ) for a totally symmetrical ( antisymmetrical ) color configuration .",
