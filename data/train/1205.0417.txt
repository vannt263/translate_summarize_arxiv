    "the modeling and estimation of dependencies is attracting an increasing attention over the last decades in various fields of science like mathematical finance , actuarial science or hydrology , among others .",
    "in discrete time models , one of the most popular approaches is the concept of copulas which allows one to separate the effects of dependence of a random vector from its univariate marginal behavior . in the bivariate case ,",
    "the copula of a continuous random vector @xmath5 is the unique function @xmath6 ^ 2\\rightarrow[0,1]$ ] for which the identity @xmath7 = c \\bigl({\\mathbb{p}}[x\\le x ] , { \\mathbb{p}}[y\\le y ] \\bigr)\\ ] ] holds for all @xmath8 .",
    "this formula , known as sklar s theorem , is usually interpreted in the way that the copula completely characterizes the stochastic dependence between @xmath9 and @xmath10 and hence represents the primary object of interest for investigating dependencies . for introductions to the concept of copulas in the aforementioned fields of science",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the books of @xcite and @xcite provide compendiums on the mathematical background and on various parametric models .",
    "the huge amount of applications gave rise to a great demand for statistical methods , of which semi- and nonparametric estimation in discrete time i.i.d .",
    "models has been investigated in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others .    on the other hand ,",
    "a huge number of models in applied stochastics relies on an underlying process which is defined in continuous time .",
    "a basic tool in this framework is the class of ( multidimensional ) lvy processes which provides a flexible way to model empirically observed behavior and includes prime examples such as brownian motion and the ( compound ) poisson process .",
    "statistical methods in this context ( including the somewhat more involved one of it semimartingales ) depend on the nature of the observation schemes which are usually classified as high - frequency and low - frequency setups . in both areas",
    "the literature on nonparametrics has grown considerably over the last decade .",
    "general overviews on high - frequency statistics can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to mention only a few approaches in detail which are close to our focus on jump processes we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "seminal papers in the low frequency setting are , for instance , due to @xcite and recently to @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to combine both strands of the literature and to provide nonparametric methods to estimate the dependence structure of a multivariate lvy process . for the sake of brevity we will concentrate on the bivariate case solely , but extensions to the general @xmath11-dimensional setting are straightforward to obtain as well .",
    "thus , let @xmath12 be a two - dimensional lvy process with lvy ",
    "it decomposition @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a drift vector , @xmath15 is a bivariate brownian motion with some covariance matrix @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the jump measure of the lvy process and its compensator , respectively .",
    "it is well - known that the compensator takes the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the so - called lvy measure of @xmath0 .",
    "given the choice of the truncation function @xmath21 , the law of @xmath0 is uniquely determined by the lvy triplet @xmath22 .    as noted above , in the framework of statistics for stochastic processes",
    "it is inevitable to lose some words on the underlying observation scheme .",
    "we decide to work in a high - frequency setting which means in the simplest case that at stage  @xmath1 one is able to observe one realization of the process @xmath0 at the equidistant times @xmath23 , @xmath24 , for a mesh @xmath25 .",
    "a more general setup including irregularly spaced data and asynchronous observations will be provided as well . within the class of high - frequency settings",
    "a further distinction regards the nature of the covered time horizon .",
    "usually , we have either @xmath26 , corresponding to a finite time horizon ( a trading day , say ) , whereas @xmath27 means that the process is eventually observed on the entire time span @xmath28 .",
    "due to the independence of the continuous part and the jump part of a lvy process , the analysis of the stochastic nature of @xmath0 canonically splits into inference on the covariance matrix @xmath16 and inference on the jump measure  @xmath29 .",
    "however , estimation of the characteristics of the brownian part of @xmath0 with or without additional jumps is well understood in the high - frequency setup [ among others , see @xcite for a thorough theory on the behavior of more general it semimartingales ] , so our focus in this paper will be on the jump dependence of the two components . in analogy to standard copulas for random vectors we will employ a concept of a lvy copula to capture the dependence structure within @xmath29 which dates back to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will follow a slightly different approach due to @xcite and @xcite , however , and focus on nonparametric methods to assess the closely related pareto  lvy copula .",
    "consult also @xcite for related work on jump dependence using extreme value theory .",
    "besides parametric approaches to infer the ( pareto ) lvy copula such as @xcite , nonparametric methods in this area are hardly available . to the best of our knowledge , the only concept is due to the unpublished work of @xcite who constructs an estimator for the lvy copula based on a limit representation involving ordinary copulas .",
    "some asymptotic properties are provided , but no explicit proof is available . on the other hand , since the ( pareto )",
    "lvy copula captures the tendency of the process to have joint ( largely negative ) jumps , the need for reliable nonparametric estimators is evident from practice , particularly with a view on finance .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite who model operational risk via pareto  lvy copulas .",
    "this convinces us that there is a clear gap in the literature which we aim to fill in this work .",
    "in contrast to laeven s method , our approach will be based directly on the defining relation of the pareto ",
    "lvy copula @xmath30 which involves tail integrals of both the lvy measure and its marginals . for simplicity",
    ", we will focus on the spectrally positive case only , that is , we assume that @xmath0 has only positive jumps in both directions .",
    "equivalently , the lvy measure @xmath29 has support on @xmath31 , and @xmath30 will then naturally be a function on the same space . in the case where all marginal tail integrals have",
    "full range @xmath32 $ ] , we obtain a representation of @xmath30 as a functional of those , and we propose to estimate @xmath30 by using appropriate estimators for the tail integrals .",
    "it turns out that in order to do so , we are forced to work in the high - frequency setting with infinite time horizon , that is , @xmath27 . under some rather mild assumptions we are then able to prove weak convergence of a suitably standardized version of @xmath33 in a certain function space , which will be our main result . as a by - product",
    ", we obtain a donsker theorem for the bivariate lvy measure as well ; a result which is similar in spirit to the recent work of @xcite , but in a high - frequency setting rather than a low - frequency world .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : plc ] is devoted to a brief discussion on jump dependence of bivariate lvy processes .",
    "we summarize the concept of pareto  lvy copulas and derive some of their analytical properties . in section  [ sec : est ]",
    "we define estimators for bivariate tail integrals , as well as for their associated pareto ",
    "lvy copulas .",
    "weak convergence of these estimators is discussed in section  [ sec : weak ] , while section  [ sec : irr ] is devoted to deviations from the ideal sampling scheme .",
    "a  brief discussion of our results , a small simulation study and a real data example are provided in section  [ sec : sim ] , whereas some conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "finally , the main steps of the proofs are postponed to section  [ sec : aux ] , while more technical details are treated in a supplementary appendix .",
    "suppose that we are given a bivariate lvy process @xmath0 of the form ( [ levy ] ) where @xmath29 denotes its lvy measure . as already stated in the , one assumption will be that @xmath29 has support on @xmath31 , which means that both components of @xmath0 only have positive jumps .",
    "this condition is for notational convenience in first place , as we will see later that one can follow a similar approach in order to estimate the jump dependence in the other three quadrants as well .",
    "let us review some recent concepts of jump dependence .",
    "the basic quantity in this framework is the bivariate tail integral @xmath34 associated with @xmath29 , which , for the moment , will be defined as a function from @xmath32 ^ 2 \\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ ] to @xmath35 by @xmath36 \\times[x_2,\\infty ] \\bigr ) , \\qquad{\\mathbf{x}}=(x_1,x_2).\\ ] ] from the theory of lvy processes it is well known that this quantity gives the average amount of jumps of @xmath0 which fall into the interval @xmath37 \\times[x_2,\\infty]$ ] during a time period of length one . since @xmath0 has cdlg paths , @xmath38 is necessarily finite . in the same way , we are able to introduce marginal tail integrals",
    ". precisely , let @xmath39 \\to[0,\\infty]$ ] , @xmath40 , be defined via @xmath41 \\times \\mathbb r\\bigr ) \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad u_2(x_2 ) = \\nu\\bigl(\\mathbb r \\times[x_2 , \\infty]\\bigr).\\ ] ] again , @xmath42 is finite for @xmath43 , but in the infinite activity case we may have @xmath44 , @xmath40 .",
    "it is obvious that the entire information about @xmath29 is contained in the tail integral  @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , just as for regular copulas , one might be interested in splitting @xmath34 into several functions which are related to the jump behavior of @xmath0 in the marginals ( naturally given by the univariate tail integrals @xmath45 ) and a lvy copula @xmath46 which captures the specific tendency of @xmath0 to have joint jumps . having this intuition in mind , @xcite provided the following definition .",
    "a bivariate lvy copula for lvy processes with positive jumps is a function @xmath47 ^ 2 \\setminus\\{(\\infty,\\infty)\\ } \\to[0 , \\infty ) $ ] which :    is grounded , that is , @xmath48 for all @xmath49 $ ] ;    has uniform margins , so @xmath50 for all @xmath51 ;    is 2-increasing , that is , @xmath52 for all @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    the main result on lvy copulas is a version of sklar s famous theorem which states that for each tail integral @xmath34 with marginals @xmath55 and @xmath56 there exists a lvy copula @xmath46 such that @xmath57 ^ 2 \\setminus\\bigl\\{(0,0)\\bigr\\},\\ ] ] holds . similarly to the usual copula , @xmath46 is uniquely defined on @xmath58 and , in particular , @xmath46 is globally unique if @xmath59 $ ] for @xmath40 .",
    "this becomes our second main assumption . in that case",
    ", we obtain a representation of @xmath46 via @xmath60 ^ 2 \\setminus\\bigl\\{(\\infty,\\infty)\\bigr\\},\\ ] ] where , for any @xmath61 \\to[0,\\infty)$ ] which is nonincreasing , left - continuous and satisfies @xmath62 , @xmath63 \\to [ 0,\\infty)$ ] denotes the generalized inverse function @xmath64 and where we use the convention @xmath65 .",
    "the inverse statement of sklar s theorem is true as well : knowledge of the marginals @xmath45 and the lvy copula @xmath46 completely determines @xmath34 and thus in turn  @xmath29 .",
    "a drawback of the approach of @xcite is , however , that @xmath46 is not a tail integral itself .",
    "this is in contrast to the regular copula of a random vector which couples marginal distribution functions and is a bivariate distribution function on its own .",
    "this circumstance makes the interpretation of a l ' evy copula quite difficult , and for that reason it appears to be natural to focus on an alternative notion of copula in this setting .",
    "[ def : plc ] a bivariate pareto ",
    "lvy copula for lvy processes with positive jumps is a function @xmath66 ^ 2 \\setminus\\{(0,0)\\ } \\to[0 , \\infty)$ ] which :    is grounded , that is , @xmath67 for all @xmath68 $ ] ;    has pareto margins , so @xmath69 for all @xmath68 $ ] ;    is 2-increasing .    as usual",
    ", we set @xmath70 and vice versa . following @xcite , sklar s theorem now reads as follows : given @xmath34 and its marginals",

    "since @xmath30 is 2-increasing as well , it is a simple task to deduce that it satisfies the properties of a tail integral of a spectrally positive l ' evy process as claimed .",
    "thus the pareto ",
    "lvy copula allows for the interpretation that the marginals of @xmath29 are standardized to the lvy measures of a 1-stable lvy process , which is similar in spirit to the ordinary copula concept where marginals are standardized to uniform distributions .",
    "finally , we collect some basic properties of pareto  lvy copulas , some of which already have been stated in @xcite and @xcite in the context of lvy copulas .",
    "[ prop : plc ] every pareto lvy copula @xmath30 has the following properties :    .",
    "@xmath73 .    .",
    "@xmath30 is 2-increasing and the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 are nonincreasing for each fixed @xmath76 .    ) .",
    "@xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote the pareto lvy copulas corresponding to perfect positive dependence and to independence , respectively .    .",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 . for fixed @xmath82 , the partial derivative @xmath83 exists for almost all @xmath84 , and for such @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    "we have @xmath87 furthermore , the mapping @xmath88 is defined and nondecreasing almost everywhere .",
    "analogous results hold for the partial derivative with respect to @xmath86 .",
    "in the following we are interested in the construction of an estimator @xmath89 for @xmath30 which is based on relation ( [ plc2 ] ) and empirical versions of the tail integrals @xmath34 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . such estimators have , for instance , been discussed in @xcite in the univariate setting , and we will transfer them naturally to the bivariate case .    before we introduce these empirical versions , it turns out to be convenient to slightly change the domain of @xmath34 . since by assumption no negative jumps are involved , we have @xmath90 \\times[0,\\infty ] ) = \\nu([x_1 , \\infty ] \\times [ -\\infty,\\infty ] ) $ ] for each @xmath91 , and similarly for the second component .",
    "therefore it is equally well possible to define @xmath34 in the same way as before , but as a function @xmath92 , where @xmath93 ^ 2 \\cup \\bigl ( \\{- \\infty\\ } \\times(0,\\infty ] \\bigr ) \\cup \\bigl ( ( 0,\\infty ] \\times\\ { -\\infty\\ } \\bigr).\\ ] ] note that , on the stripes through @xmath94 , @xmath34 corresponds to the marginal tail integrals @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "our estimator for the function @xmath34 will be defined on @xmath95 as well .",
    "we set @xmath96 where @xmath4 and @xmath97 denotes the @xmath98th increment of @xmath99 , @xmath40 . having the role of the stripes through @xmath94 in mind ,",

    "weak convergence of @xmath102 in an appropriate function space is established in theorem  [ prop1 ] below .",
    "the underlying idea behind @xmath102 is rather natural , given the interpretation of @xmath34 as the average number of jumps of a certain size during the unit interval .",
    "stationarity and indepedence of increments of a lvy process ensure that the same behavior is to be expected over intervals of arbitrary size , as long as @xmath34 is standardized accordingly . therefore , a canonical idea is to count joint large increments of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , as they indicate joint large jumps over the corresponding time interval .",
    "this is precisely what @xmath102 does .",
    "[ rem : obs ] several comments regarding the conditions on the underlying sampling scheme are in order .    in order for @xmath102 to be consistent ,",
    "it is necessary to be in the high - frequency setting with infinite time horizon , that is , @xmath105 . if we restrict ourselves to observations from a fixed time interval @xmath106 $ ] , there are only finitely many jumps larger than a given size , which is clearly not sufficient to draw inference on the entire distribution of the jumps .    in reality",
    ", one usually neither sees both components of @xmath0 at the same time nor has a regular sampling scheme of observations with distance @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the methods proposed in this section need to be sharpened when dealing with a more general setup including irregularly spaced data and asynchronous observations which is done in section  [ sec : irr ] below .",
    "the same comment applies concerning microstructure noise issues , in which case the distribution of the increments depends heavily on the distribution of the noise variables added .",
    "the method of counting large increments in order to identify jumps is a feature of observation schemes at high frequency . in a low frequency world , with @xmath107 being fixed , one rather observes a superposition of jumps and increments of the continuous part and needs deconvolution techniques to distinguish between both effects .    in order to construct an empirical version of ( [ plc2 ] ) recall the definition of a generalized inverse function in ( [ geni ] ) .",
    "let @xmath34 be the tail integral of a bivariate lvy process with positive jumps and @xmath55 , @xmath56 be its marginal tail integrals .",
    "using their empirical versions ( [ un ] ) and ( [ uni ] ) we define , for any @xmath108 ^ 2\\setminus\\ { ( 0,0 ) \\}$ ] , the _ empirical pareto  lvy copula _ as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the generalized inverse function of @xmath111 as defined in ( [ geni ] ) , with the convention that @xmath112 and where @xmath113 for some @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "finally , we set @xmath115 .    in order to understand why @xmath116 is introduced ,",
    "suppose that we are interested in estimating @xmath117 even though it is known to take the value @xmath118 .",
    "our estimator becomes @xmath119 then , which is in general close to @xmath118 due to the definition of @xmath120 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we forget about @xmath116 , we obtain @xmath121 which only counts those increments of @xmath0 where the first component exceeds @xmath122 and the second one is nonnegative . due to the existence of a brownian part in @xmath0",
    ", however , we can not expect these two estimators to be close , since a nonnegligible number of increments in the second component is indeed negative , and thus this estimator is considerably smaller than @xmath123 .    in the general case of arbitrary jumps , a similar construction allows for the estimation of @xmath30 in the interior of each of the four quadrants separately .",
    "indeed , @xcite give a general notion of tail integrals and pareto  lvy copulas in their definition 4 , and from sklar s theorem in this context ( which is their theorem 1 ) we know that the same relation as ( [ plc2 ] ) holds for @xmath124 and determines @xmath30 uniquely .",
    "for the sake of brevity we dispense with the entire theory in this setting .",

    "this , however , does not affect the validity of theorem [ theo2 ] per se , since a single increment of @xmath0 contributes with either @xmath205 or zero to @xmath206 , so its influence is negligible in the asymptotics , and as @xmath207 holds , one can equally well use the observations over @xmath208 $ ] to estimate the function @xmath34 .",

    "we call @xmath209 , @xmath210 , the series of observations times connected with the process @xmath103 , whereas @xmath211 , @xmath212 , belongs to the second component  @xmath104 . for simplicity",
    "only , we assume that the endpoints coincide , that is @xmath213 .",
    "as before , we denote with @xmath214 the mesh of the @xmath215th time series .    in this situation it is less obvious how to count the number of joint large jumps , as increments over @xmath103 and @xmath104 are in general never computed over the same time intervals . in spirit of @xcite , however , it appears reasonable to construct a nave estimator from counting those pairs of large increments which are computed over at least overlapping intervals . of course",
    ", in this case it may happen that jumps at different times ( but close nearby ) are treated as joint ones .",
    "for this reason it is important to assume additional properties of the jump measures which make such an event unlikely .",

    "assume further that the sampling scheme satisfies @xmath232 as well as @xmath233 and @xmath234 for some @xmath235 , and similarly for the increments involving @xmath236 .",

    "it is remarkable that even though methods similar to the case of volatility estimation work for inference on @xmath34 as well , the results look quite different in this setting : in case of irregular observations , only very few additional assumptions on the observation scheme are necessary , which is in contrast to the restrictive conditions of @xcite regarding covolatility .",
    "this happens , however , at the cost of additional assumptions on the structure of the underlying lvy process .",
    "when dealing with irregular sampling times , we obtain the same central limit theorem as for equidistant ones .",
    "this has again no direct connection to volatility estimation , as the corresponding result in @xcite comes with a different variance .",
    "there is a variety of models which satisfy assumptions  [ ass ] and [ ass2 ] . among the simplest",
    "are stable processes in both components , coupled by some lvy copula which is twice continuously differentiable away from the origin ( e.g. , the clayton one ) .      in this section",
    "we discuss briefly deviations from assumption ( [ levy ] ) on the observed process .",
    "suppose that the underlying process is an it semimartingale with the representation @xmath239 instead , where @xmath240 and @xmath241 are bounded and left - continuous processes .",
    "recall that all central limit theorems proposed before deal with sums of large increments of @xmath0 , interpreted as coming from large jumps over the same time intervals .",
    "this intuition is based on the fact that the probability of the continuous lvy part to become large over small time intervals is exponentially small , and therefore it is likely that these claims remain valid under weaker conditions on @xmath0 as well . the following theorem states that this is indeed the case , if we assume that all sampling schemes satisfy similar growth conditions as in theorem  [ theo3 ] .",
    "[ theo4 ] let @xmath0 be an it semimartingale as above , and assume that the respective assumptions on the sampling schemes from theorems  [ theo1 ] , [ theo2 ] and  [ theo3 ] are satisfied . assume further that the sampling schemes satisfy @xmath242 for theorems  [ theo1 ] or  [ theo2 ] , respectively , and for some @xmath235 .",
    "then , the weak convergence results of the respective theorems hold .",
    "the proof relies on replacing increments of @xmath0 by corresponding increments of a pure jump lvy process in order to apply theorems on weak convergence based on sums of independent observations . at this stage ,",
    "the additional conditions on the sampling scheme come into play .",
    "weaker conditions might be sufficient here , if one was able to prove weak convergence based on some type of conditional independence instead , then using different approximations for increments of @xmath0 .",
    "an important issue regarding high - frequency data is the presence of microstructure noise , in which case one does not observe the plain l ' evy process , but @xmath243 where the @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 , are i.i.d .",
    "processes , independent of @xmath9 , which satisfy @xmath247 = 0 $ ] and have moments of all order . in this case , our estimator for the lvy measure does not work anymore . to see this ,",
    "let us for simplicity stick to the univariate setting .",
    "we have @xmath248 now , and if there is a positive probability of @xmath249 , then @xmath250 will behave like @xmath251 which diverges to infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath252 , then @xmath250 is still bounded , but will rather estimate a convolution of jumps and noise than the plain jump measure .",
    "microstructure noise issues are well understood in the context of diffusions .",
    "however , it appears that none of the standard methods for diffusion processes [ let us mention the multiscale approach by @xcite and the kernel - based one due to @xcite ] can directly be applied in our context .",
    "even the pre - averaging approach by @xcite , which provides a general concept for diminishing the influence of the noise by retaining information about increments of @xmath9 , fails when one is interested in the lvy measure . in the following",
    ", we will briefly discuss these issues .",
    "for an auxiliary sequence @xmath253 and some piecewise differentiable function @xmath254 on @xmath204 $ ] with @xmath255 , @xcite discuss @xmath256 , where , for an arbitrary @xmath10 and @xmath257 , @xmath258 while @xmath259 can be seen as some kind of generalized increment which still bears similar information as the plain @xmath260 , we have @xmath261 here we use both piecewise differentiability of @xmath254 and the assumptions concerning @xmath254 on the boundary of @xmath204 $ ] .",
    "therefore the larger @xmath253 becomes , the less important is the contamination by noise .",
    "for this reason , estimation based on pre - averaging usually works in the way that one proceeds as usual , but replaces the standard estimators by ones based on @xmath262 .",
    "if @xmath253 is rather large compared with @xmath1 , it is reasonable to replace @xmath262 with @xmath259 in the asymptotics and thus to recover full information of @xmath9 . in our",
    "setting this would lead to an estimator of the form @xmath263 where the @xmath264 are computed over nonoverlapping intervals to retain i.i.d .",
    "terms in the sum .",
    "as noted above , for large @xmath253 it is equally well possible to discuss @xmath265 which is defined similarly to @xmath266 above , but using @xmath267 instead of @xmath264 .",
    "this procedure , however , does not result in an estimator for the lvy distribution function @xmath268 .",
    "the reason is that the leading term in an expansion of @xmath269 is due to a single large jump within @xmath270 $ ] . in this case ,",
    "its contribution to @xmath271 depends on its exact position within the interval , as it has to be standardized by @xmath272 accordingly .",
    "for example , if the jump occurs in the small interval @xmath273 $ ] , it is not important whether the jump is larger than @xmath274 , but whether it is larger than @xmath275 .",
    "since the jump time is uniformly distributed , one can show formally that @xmath276 which proves that @xmath277 converges to @xmath278 and is therefore not consistent for @xmath268 .",
    "construction of a consistent estimator for the lvy measure in case of microstructure noise thus seems to be a challenging topic for future research .",
    "suppose a statistician has knowledge of the marginal tail integrals . in this case ,",
    "the results in section  [ sec : weak ] provide two competitive asymptotically unbiased estimators for the pareto ",
    "lvy copula , namely the oracle estimator @xmath279 exploiting knowledge of the marginals and the empirical pareto ",
    "lvy copula @xmath89 ignoring this additional information .",
    "the following proposition gives a partial answer to the question of which estimator is ( asymptotically ) preferable . perhaps surprisingly , ignoring the additional knowledge decreases the asymptotic variance under certain growth conditions on @xmath30 .",
    "a similar observation has recently been made in the context of copula estimation ; see @xcite .",
    "[ prop : comp ] suppose that the pareto ",
