    "example applications of _ iot _ are smart homes , health monitoring , wearables , environment monitoring , transportation and industrial automation . within an _ iot _",
    ", various types of wireless networks are required to facilitate the exchange of application - dependant data among their heterogeneous wireless devices .",
    "however , such diversity could give rise to coexistence issues among these networks , a challenge that limits the large - scale deployment of the _ iot_. therefore , new protocols are required for communication compatibility among its heterogeneous devices .",
    "basically , the _ ieee 802.15.6 _ standard @xcite , e.g. , _ wbans _ , utilizes a narrower bandwidth than other wireless networks , e.g. , _",
    "ieee 802.11_. however , the _ ieee 802.11 _ based wireless devices may use multiple channels that cover the whole international license - free _ 2.4 ghz _",
    "ndustrial , cientific and edical radio , denoted by _ ism _ ,",
    "band , so there could be overlapping channel covering an _ ieee 802.15.6 _ based network and thus create collisions between _ ieee 802.15.6 _ and these devices .",
    "in addition , _ ieee 802.11 _ based wireless devices may transmit at a high power level and thus relatively distant coexisting _ ieee 802.15.6 _ devices may still suffer interference .",
    "thus , the pervasive growth in wireless devices and the push for interconnecting them can be challenging for _",
    "_ wban__s due to their simple and energy - constrained nature . basically , a _",
    "wban _ may suffer interference not only because of the presence of other _",
    "_ wban__s but also from wireless devices within the general _ iot _ simultaneously operating on the same channel .",
    "thus , co - channel interference may arise due to the collisions amongst the concurrent transmissions made by sensors in different _ _ wban__s collocated in an _ iot _ and hence such potential interference can be detrimental to the operation of _ _ wban__s .",
    "therefore , robust communication is necessary among the individual devices of the collocated networks in an _",
    "iot_.    in this paper , we propose a protocol to enable _ wban _ operation within an _ iot _ and leverage the emerging _",
    "ble _ technology to facilitate interference detection and mitigation .",
    "motivated by the reduced power consumption and low cost of _ ble _ devices , we integrate a _",
    "ble _ transceiver and a _ cr _ module within each _ wban _ s coordinator node , denoted by _ crd _ , where the role of _ ble _ is to inform the _",
    "crd _ about the frequency channels that are being used in its vicinity .",

    "when experiencing high interference , the _ wban s crd _ will be notified by the _",

    "avoidance and mitigation of channel interference have been extensively researched in the wireless communication literature . to the best of our knowledge , the published techniques in the realm of _ iot _ are very few and can be categorized as resource sharing and allocation , power control , scheduling techniques and medium access schemes .",

    "bakshi et al . , @xcite proposed a completely asynchronous and distributed solution for data communication across _ iot _ , called _",

    "the originality of this work resides in the use of traffic history to guide the channel allocation in a distributed manner .",

    "the authors proposed a framework of full - duplex _",
    "m2 m _ communication in which the energy transfer , i.e. , surplus energy , from the receiver to the transmitter and the data transmission from the transmitter to the receiver take place at the same time over the same frequency .",
    "furthermore , the authors established a stochastic game - based model to characterize the interaction between autonomous _",
    "transmitter and receiver .",
    "meanwhile , chen et al .",
    ", @xcite introduced a new area packet scheduling technique involving _ ieee 802.15.6 _ and _ ieee 802.11 _ devices .",
    "the developed packet scheduler is based on transmitting a common control signal known as the blank burst from _ mac _ layer .",
    "the control signal prevents the _ ieee 802.15.6 _ devices to transmit for a certain period of time during which the _ ieee 802.11 _ devices could transmit data packets .",

    "basically , in _ ack - id _ , a novel interference detection process is performed before the transmission of each _ zigbee _ _ ack _ packet in order to decide whether the channel is experiencing interference or not .",
    "inoue et.al .",
    ", @xcite proposed a novel distributed active channel reservation scheme for coexistence , called _ dacros _ , to solve the problem of _ wban _ and _ ieee 802.11 _ wireless networks coexistence .",
    "_ dacros _ uses the request - to - send and clear - to - send frames to reserve the channel for a superframe time of _ wban_. along the whole beacon time , i.e. , the whole superframe of the _ wban _ , all _ ieee 802.11 _ wireless devices remain silent and do not transmit to avoid collisions .",
    "zhang et al . , @xcite proposed cooperative carrier signaling , namely , _",
    "ccs _ , to harmonize the coexistence of _ zigbee _ _ _ wban__s with _ ieee 802.11 _ wireless networks .",
    "_ ccs _ allows _ zigbee _ _ _ wban__s to avoid _ ieee 802.11 _ wireless network - caused collisions and employs a separate _ zigbee _ device to emit a busy tone signal concurrently with the _ zigbee _ data transmission .",
    "as pointed out , none of the predominant approaches can be directly applied to _ iot _ because they do not consider the heterogeneity of the individual networks forming an _ iot _ in their design .",
    "motivated by the emergence of _ ble _ technology and compared to the previous predominant approaches for interference mitigation , our approach lowers the power and communication overheads introduced on the coordinator- and sensor - levels within each _",
    "wban_.    unlike prior work ,",

    "each interfering sensor will then switch to the new channel to retransmit data to the _ crd _ in its allocated backup time - slot .",
    "bluetooth low energy ( _ ble _ ) is one of the promising technologies for _ iot _ services because of its low energy consumption and cost . _",
    "ble _ is a wireless technology used for transmitting data over short distances and broadcasting advertisements at a regular interval via radio waves .",
    "ble _ advertisement is a one - way communication method .",
    "_ ble _ devices , e.g. , ibeacons , that want to be discovered can periodically broadcast self - contained packets of data .",
    "these packets are collected by devices like smartphones , where they can be used for a variety of applications to trigger prompt actions .",
    "we envision that each collocated set ( cluster ) of wireless devices of such _ iot _ will have to include a _",
    "transceiver that periodically broadcasts the channel that is being used by the _",
    "devices in the vicinity .",
    "in fact , with the increased popularity of _ ble _ , it is conceivable that every _ iot _ device will be equipped with a _ ble _",

    "the _ iot _ environment consists of different wireless networks , each uses some set of common channels in the international license - free _ 2.4 ghz _ _ ism _ band .",
    "in addition , we assume that each network transmits using different levels of transmission power , bandwidth , data rates and modulation schemes . meanwhile , _ _ wban__s are getting pervasive and thus form a building block for the ever - evolving future _",

    "basically , we assume all _ crds _ are equipped with richer energy supply than sensors and all sensors have access to all _ zigbee _ channels at any time .",
    "in addition , each _ crd _ is integrated with _",

    "furthermore , each _ crd _ has a _ cr _ module to decide the usability and the stability of a channel .",
    "a co - channel interference takes place if the simultaneous transmissions of sensors and the _ crd _ in a _ wban _",
    "collide with those of other _ iot _ coexisting devices .",
    "the potential for such a collision problem grows with the increase in the communication range and the density of sensors in the individual _ _ wban__s as well as the number of collocated _ iot _ devices . to address this problem , our approach assigns each _ wban _ a _ default channel _ and in case of interference it allows the individual sensors to switch to a different channel to be picked by the _ crd _ in consultation with the _ cr _ module to mitigate the interference .",
    "the use of _ ble _ enables the _ crd _ to be aware of interference conditions faster and more efficiently . to achieve that",
