    "because of their stability and quantization , it is natural to regard topological defects as independent degrees of freedom in systems with broken symmetry . perhaps the most storied example is the abrikosov phase of type ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "there , in the london limit , variations in the phase of the macroscopic wave function can be decomposed into a `` smooth '' part and a singular part , the former being analogous to spin waves .",
    "the singular component represents the topological defects  those lines ( in the three dimensional case ) around which the phase slips by @xmath2 .",
    "the spin waves can be removed from the theory resulting in an effective theory of repulsive vortices @xcite .",
    "being the ideal proving ground for the study of broken symmetries , liquid crystalline states provide us with a variety of line - like and point - like defects which , because of the anisotropy of the surrounding medium , can enjoy orientationally dependent interactions . with the flux - lattice in mind ,",
    "we consider the smectic - a liquid crystal which is a close analog of the superconductor @xcite . indeed ,",
    "both the superconductor and the smectic - a phase have a complex scalar order parameter , representing macroscopic phase ordering of the cooper pair wavefunctions and the one - dimensional periodic density modulation , respectively .",
    "the superconducting order parameter is minimally coupled to a gauge field , while the smectic - a order parameter is coupled to the director modes of a nematic phase which exists at higher temperatures : @xmath3 + f_{\\rm frank}[{\\bf n}]\\ ] ] where @xmath4 = \\int d^3\\!x\\,\\left\\{\\left\\vert\\left(\\nabla - i q_0{\\bf n}\\right)\\psi\\right\\vert^2 + r \\vert\\psi\\vert^2 + u\\vert\\psi\\vert^4\\right\\}\\ ] ] and @xmath5 is the standard frank free energy for a ( possibly chiral ) nematic : @xmath6&= & \\int d^3\\!x\\,\\big\\{k_1 \\left(\\nabla \\cdot { \\bf n}\\right)^2 + k_2 \\left [ { \\bf n } \\cdot \\left(\\nabla \\times { \\bf n } \\right ) + k_0 \\right]^2\\nonumber\\\\ & & + k_3 \\left[{\\bf n } \\times \\left(\\nabla \\times { \\bf n } \\right ) \\right]^2 \\big\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath7 is the unit director field .",
    "though deceptively similar to , for instance , a gauge - fixed landau - ginzburg theory the differences are profound .",
    "fluctuation effects are famously more complicated at both the transition @xcite and in the ordered state @xcite .",
    "the landau - ginzburg - de gennes theory predicts a nematic to smectic - a transition when @xmath8 . in the ordered state @xmath9 and the gradient term in ( [ eq : sma ] ) favors states for which @xmath10 . because @xmath7 is a unit vector ,",
    "the phase of @xmath11 necessarily varies in space . in the ground state , if we take the nematic to order along @xmath12 , then @xmath13 . in the `` london '' limit",
    ", we consider fluctuations only in the phase of @xmath11 and not @xmath14 .",

    "the transverse modes of the director are attenuated at a length scale @xmath27 where @xmath28 is on the order of the frank elastic constants .",
    "known as the meissner effect in superconductors this result shows that smectic order excludes twist , @xmath29 .",
    "departing from the quadratic approximations of ( [ eq : quad ] ) we can make this observation more general . in the full nonlinear theory",
    ", @xmath30 is still nonvanishing when @xmath8 . in the london limit",
    "we write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a phase field and the mass density is @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "it follows that the smectic layers sit at the density peaks defined by @xmath34 for @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ level sets of @xmath36 .",
    "again , the gradient term in ( [ eq : sma ] ) requires that @xmath37 for constant @xmath14 , so at long distances the director is perpendicular to the level sets or , in other words is parallel to the unit layer normal @xmath38 .",
    "however , the twist order parameter is @xmath39 , and it is straightforward to check that if @xmath40 then @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the smectic layers are incompatible with twist then surfaces can be found with @xmath42 as their unit normals @xcite ] .    in order to relieve the incompatibility between smectic order and twist , it is necessary to allow @xmath14 to vary and , in fact , vanish at isolated points to form topological defects .",
    "indeed , the competition between molecular chirality and the existence of layers leads to the celebrated twist - grain - boundary ( tgb ) phase  @xcite .",
    "this phase is the analog of the abrikosov flux lattice  @xcite , with screw dislocations replacing flux lines and molecular chirality replacing the magnetic field . in smectics - a",
    ", however , there is an additional complication : the coupling of geometry to elasticity requires that the screw dislocations and layers rotate together . for small angles of rotation",
    ", the layer structure can be approximated using linear elasticity ( [ eq : quad ] ) @xcite .",
    "the underlying rotational invariance of the compression strain , however , necessitates certain essential nonlinearities which have profound effects on the ground state energetics and layer displacements @xcite . for large - angle twist - grain boundaries , seen for instance in bent - core systems @xcite ,",
    "the nonlinearities become important and we are forced to confront the full nonlinear elasticity . because of the difficulty in systematically removing the unit director @xmath42 from the theory , we go immediately to a rotationally - invariant free energy in terms of the phase field @xmath36 . again , the gradient coupling in ( [ eq : sma ] ) sets @xmath37 , so we know that the compression strain vanishes when @xmath43 or , equivalently , when @xmath44 , which indicates that the layers are spaced by one period along the layer normal  _ i.e. _ equally spaced layers .",
    "we write the compression strain in terms of both @xmath45 and the eulerian displacement field @xmath46 : @xmath47 = \\partial_z u - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left(\\nabla u\\right)^2.\\ ] ] the factor of @xmath48 is introduced so that in the linearized strain , @xmath49 , the standard result",
    ". note that the nonlinear term in ( [ eq : strain ] ) is required by rotational invariance and is not merely an anharmonic correction to the elasticity .",
    "it is responsible for strong and subtle corrections to linear elasticity  @xcite .",
    "the bending energy is inherited from the frank free energy and is simply @xmath50 .",
    "we note , however , that this is precisely twice the mean curvature of the layers  @xcite , @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we write the full nonlinear free energy as @xmath52 ^ 2 +   8\\lambda^2 h^2\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the compression modulus and @xmath54 is the `` splay penetration length '' .",
    "the challenge is to find ground states which minimize ( [ eq : free ] ) with the appropriate boundary conditions . at infinity",
    "we take the layers to be perpendicular to the @xmath55-axis so that @xmath56 .",
    "there are other boundaries , however , namely lines corresponding to topological defects where @xmath45 changes by @xmath57 .",
    "recently , we have developed an approach to study tgb phases with @xmath0 grain boundaries  @xcite .",
    "our construction relies on a duality : @xmath0 twist - grain boundaries can be equivalently constructed from a sum of dislocations with burgers vector @xmath58 , or a sum of dislocations rotated by ninety degrees with burgers vector @xmath59 . using this duality , a closed - form expression for the height of the smectic layers ensues and generates schnerk s first surface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schnerkpic ] ) , one of a class of mathematical surfaces formed by summing individual screw dislocations . in this paper",
    ", we elaborate on our construction and the energetics of schnerk s first surface .",
    "we then identify a third set of defects that lie along the pitch axis .",
    "we use this set of previously unknown defects to study rotation angles smaller than @xmath0 and identify a privileged set of angles with particularly simple structures and correspondingly low energies .",
    "the building blocks of any tgb phase are the screw dislocations  when properly put together these effect a twist on the smectic layers without requiring the complete disappearance of the smectic order along a two - dimensional wall .",
    "we write the screw dislocation in terms of the phase field @xmath60 as : @xmath61 it is easy to verify that this phase field is an extremum of equation ( [ eq : free ] ) .",
    "in addition , for @xmath62 , this surface is identical to a relic minimal surface ( @xmath63 )  @xcite , the helicoid , and is harmonic in both three dimensions ( @xmath64 ) and in the @xmath65-plane ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "minimal surfaces have long been used as _",
    "ansatzen _ for smectic structures because they are global minima of the bending energy  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the interplay between the compression and bending energies ensures that true minimizers of equation ( [ eq : free ] ) , with more complicated topologies than the helicoid , will neither have a harmonic phase field nor be minimal .    in this paper , we will take the opposite tack and consider , not minimal surfaces , but harmonic @xmath45 formed by taking arbitrary sums of parallel screw dislocations .",
    "if we take the dislocations to have their defect axes along the @xmath67 direction with positions @xmath68 in the @xmath69plane , then we write @xmath70 as we will demonstrate , these sums will allow us to generate models for @xmath0 tgb phases .",
    "furthermore , there is an unexplored but close connection between surfaces generated by equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) and certain triply- and doubly - periodic minimal surfaces .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : singletgbs ] , we review the nonlinear theory of large - angle twist - grain boundaries , and establish our notation . in section  [ sec :",
    "surface ] , we present our theory for the @xmath0 tgb structure based on schnerk s first surface . in section  [ sec : properties ] , we discuss the properties of schnerk s first surface . in section  [ sec : moire ] , we discuss the possibility of a moir phase  @xcite of screw dislocations in tgb structures of arbitrary angle and discuss a potential lock - in mechanism for certain large angles .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] we summarize our results .",
    "here we review the construction of a single twist - grain boundary with arbitrarily large angles . to simplify our analysis",
    ", we assume the smectic layers have normal @xmath71 in the absence of dislocations and introduce the complex variable @xmath72 for the coordinates along the plane normal to @xmath73 . in this notation ,",
    "a single screw dislocation of burgers scalar @xmath58 is given by @xmath74 we introduce the constant @xmath75 here , which is set by enforcing the boundary condition that the compression strain vanish at infinity .",
    "in this simple case of one screw dislocation , we set @xmath76 at infinity , implying that @xmath77 ^ 2 = 1.\\ ] ] as we shall see , when considering doubly- and triply - periodic smectics , this boundary condition will depend on the orientation and position of the screw dislocations .",
    "a single twist - grain boundary can be decomposed into a set of dislocations with spacing @xmath78 and positions @xmath79 for integers @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "though we know of no minimizer of equation ( [ eq : free ] ) with this property , progress can be made by considering the sum  @xcite @xmath81 utilizing the infinite product @xmath82 it follows that @xcite @xmath83 to set @xmath75 now , we must go out along the @xmath84-axis only , since the @xmath85-axis contains the grain boundary . setting @xmath86 as @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 the layers are flat at @xmath89 with layer normal given by @xmath90 . for @xmath91 ,",
    "the layer normal is @xmath92 .",
    "this gives an overall angle of rotation @xmath93 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "this structure has the same topology as scherk s first surface @xcite , a minimal surface which has been used as a conjectured structure for tgbs in diblock copolymers  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , this sum and scherk s first surface are merely uniform dilations of each other : the level sets of @xmath94 are _ identical _ to scherk s first surface  @xcite when @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , the rescaled surface is minimal for any @xmath58 despite the fact that the mean curvature is nonlinear .",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture that the true smectic layer geometry falls somewhere in between the exact sum of dislocations and scherk s surface , and this expectation has been borne out by recent numerical studies of both lyotropic  @xcite and thermotropic smectics  @xcite .",
    "numerically , @xmath96 ( without rescaling ) is a slightly better than scherk s surface as a model for the layers . an important caveat , however , is that at large angles the director decouples from the layer normal near the dislocation cores  @xcite , and it would be necessary to reintroduce director modes to make contact with simulation .",
    "nevertheless , approximate analytical models are useful guides for our understanding and , in this case , yield insights into the tgb smectic structure .",
    "the coordinates @xmath97 of the level set @xmath98 satisfy @xcite @xmath99 equation ( [ eq : levelsettgb1 ] ) possesses a hidden symmetry : if we rotate the entire structure by @xmath0 , interchange @xmath100 , and simultaneously take @xmath101 , the equation is invariant . for a general rotation angle @xmath102 , this transformation exchanges @xmath78 and @xmath103 in equation ( [ eq : levelsettgb1 ] ) and changes the rotation angle from @xmath102 to @xmath104 .",
    "this allows us to view the level sets of a single tgb of any angle @xmath102 as being constructed either from parallel defects with burgers scalar @xmath58 ( along @xmath12 ) or from parallel defects with burgers scalar @xmath59 rotated by @xmath0 ( along @xmath105 ) .    on the level sets of @xmath96",
    ", we calculate @xmath106 for @xmath107 , when @xmath108 , it is clear from equation ( [ eq : gradphitgb ] ) that @xmath100 preserves the unit normal vector @xmath73 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath109 , however , is not preserved by this transformation . to see why this must be the case , notice that @xmath110 diverges at the core of defects along the @xmath67 axis , even though we have now identified an additional set of helicoids along the @xmath111 axis .",
    "though rotations by ninety degrees preserves the _ level sets _ of the surfaces , as indeed they must , they need not preserve the structure of the phase field between those level sets and , in particular , do not preserve the orientation of the defect cores .",
    "we conclude that only one set of helicoids need have cores .",
    "however , the total compression energy and bending energy remains unchanged by a ninety degree rotation ",
    "the direction of the defect cores does not alter the energy .",
    "a @xmath0 tgb phase consists of twist - grain boundaries with defects alternating along the @xmath12 and @xmath105 directions ( we assume @xmath112 is the pitch axis ) and with rotation angle @xmath107 .",
    "finding an analytical expression for such a structure from which the energy can be calculated is a daunting task  @xcite .",
    "however , the degeneracy in how we identify the defects in a single tgb structure allows a significant simplification in the structure of this phase . by applying the appropriate ninety degree rotations ,",
    "all of the dislocations can be rotated to be parallel to the @xmath55 axis , leading to a structure of alternating tgbs such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schnerkpic ] .",
    "this allows us to compute analytically the level sets of a @xmath0 tgb phase by summing parallel , alternating tgbs separated by a distance @xmath113 .",
    "this sum is given formally by @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a complex number that generates the appropriate translation between grain boundaries . to ensure that each grain boundary rotates the layers by @xmath0 , we might set , using the results of the previous section , @xmath116 .",
    "however , this relation requires a modification owing to the collaborative effect of the adjacent grain boundaries .",
    "we put off the details of setting the rotation angle to later . for now , we keep @xmath78 and @xmath58 as free parameters .",
    "we may rewrite the infinite sum in @xmath117 ( [ eq : schnerksum ] ) as @xmath118 where @xmath119}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath117 is a sum of harmonic functions in @xmath85 and @xmath84 , it follows that @xmath120 is analytic as is @xmath121 .",
    "moreover , @xmath122 is doubly periodic and it thus follows that @xmath122 can be represented in terms of elliptic functions . indeed , through an appropriate rescaling of @xmath85 and @xmath84 , @xmath122 shares all the poles and zeroes of the jacobi elliptic function @xmath123  @xcite .",
    "the same result can be established through one of the infinite product formulas for @xmath123 .",
    "we arrive at the exact summation of screw dislocations for a @xmath0 tgb structure : @xmath124\\ ] ] where @xmath125 and @xmath11 are the necessary scale factors , @xmath126^{-1/2}$ ] is an elliptic period , @xmath127^{-1/2}= i\\k(\\sqrt{1-k^2})$ ] is the other elliptic period , and @xmath128 is the elliptic modulus .",
    "the ratio of the elliptic periods is @xmath129 .",
    "it is particularly simple to consider the case that @xmath128 is pure imaginary so that @xmath130 . in this case",
    "@xmath131 ( see the appendix ) , @xmath132 and so we set @xmath133 , @xmath134 to achieve the desired periodicity . though we could tune the real part of @xmath115 , which controls the offset between grain boundaries , to generate a family of surfaces with different topologies , these identities allow for a particularly straightforward analysis of the energetics of schnerk s first surface .",
    "other choices of @xmath115 lead to elliptic moduli in which @xmath128 is , in general , complex .    the level sets of @xmath117 , schnerk s first surface , generate the triply - periodic surface shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schnerkpic ] for @xmath135 .",
    "though schnerk s first surface is not a minimizer of the smectic free energy , equation ( [ eq : free ] ) , it s construction ensures that @xmath117 is at least a harmonic function . in analogy with a single grain boundary which is topologically scherk s first surface , schnerk s first surface is likewise topologically identical to the schwarz d surface , another minimal surface .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the unit cell of schnerk s first surface ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) with that of the schwarz d surface . unfortunately , we are not aware of a simple transformation , such as a rescaling of one or more of the coordinates , that renders schnerk s surface exactly minimal",
    ". it may be interesting to note that the schwarz d surface also has a parametric representation in terms of elliptic functions  @xcite .      for arbitrary sums of parallel screw dislocations",
    ", @xmath136 is a meromorphic function of @xmath137 whose simple poles correspond to screw dislocations . in the case of schnerk s first surface , @xmath138 is a doubly periodic function of @xmath137 and we are immediately led to consider generalizations of schnerk s first surface to other defect lattices .",
    "fortunately , by liouville s theorem , a doubly periodic , meromorphic function must have residues which add to zero , which in our case means net charge neutrality of the screw dislocations . thus our construction , or any generalization of it",
    ", must always generate _ achiral _ phases since the net twist always vanishes .",
    "it is only because of the special duality at @xmath139 that we can construct a rotating structure ( though the rotation can be thought of in either direction ) . for alternating tgbs at other twist angles ,",
    "adjacent boundaries rotate the layers in opposite directions .",
    "this observation and liouville s theorem provides an alternative derivation of an observation by sethna , found in reference  @xcite , that constant density configurations of parallel screw dislocations with the same charge are impossible .",
    "in fact , a sum of screw dislocations with the _ same _ charge can be performed formally , after a suitable regularization , in terms of the weierstra  elliptic function , @xmath140  @xcite .",
    "this function , however , fails to be doubly - periodic and @xmath141 fails to describe a suitable layer geometry .",
    "we will return to the question of describing tgb phases with other twist angles in the next section .",
    "we also point out that limiting the discussion to @xmath130 is not too restrictive a condition . by utilizing the vast array of elliptic function identities",
    ", one can rewrite many choices of @xmath115 ( and subsequently @xmath128 ) in terms of an algebraic combination of elliptic functions with @xmath130 .",
    "notice , for example , that  @xcite @xmath142 allowing us to relate elliptic functions with @xmath130 to those with @xmath143 .",
    "similar relations map @xmath144 to @xmath145 and @xmath146 to @xmath147 .",
    "other relations allow us to map elliptic functions with modulus @xmath128 to those with modulus @xmath148 , and the landen transforms yield more complicated identities between elliptic functions with different moduli .",
    "to simplify our notation , we define @xmath149 ( not to be confused with the weierstra  elliptic function ) , denote its complex conjugate as @xmath150 , and use glaisher s notation ( @xmath151 for @xmath152 , @xmath153 for @xmath154 , _ etc .",

    "however , we note that though the symmetries are identical as we alter @xmath128 or @xmath159 , the surfaces are not",
    ". we will discuss this in the following .",
    "for now , we note that if @xmath160 , the compression strain is particularly simple . for this choice",

    "in the case of a single grain boundary , we set @xmath75 by considering @xmath162 . here ,",
    "the structure is triply periodic and we are forced to set @xmath43 inside one of the periods to set @xmath75 .",
    "we choose to have the compression vanish halfway between the grain boundaries , _",
    "e.g. _ along @xmath163 or @xmath164 .",
    "these lines are also where we choose to measure the rotation of the layers , and so this is a natural choice . though we should choose @xmath75 to minimize the compression energy for a single periodic domain , as @xmath165 these two procedures agree .",
    "our choice of @xmath166 is , again , particularly useful in determining @xmath75 . on the lines @xmath167 and @xmath168 , for @xmath169 , it can be shown that @xmath170 and thus @xmath171 is constant as well .",
    "we verify these identities in the appendix .",
    "we can , as a result , set @xmath75 along these lines and find : @xmath172 returning to the rotation of the layers , promised in section [ sec : piover2 ] , we measure the angle from @xmath173 to @xmath174 .",
    "we find : @xmath175.\\ ] ] as @xmath176 , @xmath177 and these expressions reduce to those for a single grain boundary .",
    "requiring @xmath139 sets @xmath178 and sets @xmath179 .",
    "again , for @xmath143 , or other generic complex values of @xmath128 , the lines of constant tilt angle are no longer straight , making this procedure difficult , if not impossible .",
    "finally , we make use of the expansion of jacobi elliptic functions  @xcite in terms of @xmath180 = -\\exp\\left[-2\\pi \\ell_b/\\ell_d\\right]$ ] :    @xmath181 = \\ln\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi w}{\\ell_d}\\right)+\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{2 } { m}\\frac{q^m } { 1+q^m } \\cos\\left(\\frac{2m\\pi   w}{\\ell_d } \\right)+\\ln\\left(\\frac{2 q^{1/4}}{\\sqrt{k}}\\right)\\ ] ]    to compute the long distance interaction between grain boundaries .",
    "recall that in the case of a single grain boundary , the nonlinear strain ( [ eq : strain ] ) leads to power - law interactions between defects @xcite . here , we are able to address the nature of the interactions _ between _ twist - grain boundaries .",
    "jacobi s formula ( [ asym ] ) leads to a simple answer : the interactions are exponential . to see this we note that the first term in ( [ asym ] ) is the @xmath137-dependent part of the phase field for a single grain boundary , as in ( [ eq : tgbsine ] ) .",
    "thus , were we to calculate the difference between the full tgb structure and a set of non - interacting grain boundaries , the correction would come from the infinite sum in ( [ asym ] ) ( note that constant @xmath182 drops out of the energetics ) .",
    "hence the corrections would be at least @xmath183 and @xmath184 $ ] : exponentially decaying interactions at @xmath113 grows with @xmath78 fixed . in the symmetric case depicted in fig .",
    "1 , though @xmath185 , @xmath186 is small enough for an expansion to be reliable .",
    "we can compare this result to the linear elasticity theory .",
    "there , without director modes , there is no interaction between screw dislocations . with the director modes",
    "included , as in ( [ eq : quad ] ) , screw dislocations interact exponentially and it follows that grain boundaries will as well @xcite .",
    "however , the attenuation length in this case is the twist penetration length @xmath187 , and not the distance between defects , @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the exponential interactions that we find here are different  they arise from elastic strains and not from the optical modes of the director",
    ".    there are some complications in calculating the interaction energy which are worth mentioning . to calculate the interaction energy we use @xmath117 to evaluate the compression in one period , @xmath188 .",
    "from this we subtract the energy of @xmath189 isolated grain boundaries , where @xmath190 is the dimension of the system in the @xmath84 direction .",
    "however , the isolated grain boundaries have tails which extend beyond a distance @xmath113 .",
    "thus while the intensive interaction energy is the difference of two integrals , they are integrals over _ different _ regions : the first @xmath191\\times[-\\ell_b/2,\\ell_b/2]$ ] , the second @xmath191\\times[-\\infty,\\infty]$ ] . fortunately , this does not spoil our argument that the interaction is a positive power of @xmath192 . in the tail from @xmath193 to @xmath194 , the integrand arising from the single grain boundary falls off exponentially , also as @xmath195 and so the contribution from the tail is also proportional to @xmath192 .",
    "we arrive at : @xmath196q\\ ] ] where @xmath197 is a positive constant of order unity whose precise value depends on the choice of cutoff at the dislocation core , @xmath198 is the @xmath55-dimension of the system , and an elastic cutoff length @xmath199 is introduced to cutoff a @xmath200 divergence in @xmath201 near the origin .",
    "this cutoff was necessary in the case of a single grain boundary  @xcite as well and arises from the infinite periodicity at the core of a helix , _",
    "i.e. _ at the core of the defect the spacing between one sheet and the next vanishes . since @xmath202 , this is an attractive , exponential interaction .",
    "stepping back and examining the arrangement of defects , the attraction is not at all surprising .",

    "our construction relies crucially on a duality : dislocations within one grain boundary can be rotated by ninety degrees , as long as the topological charge is simultaneously reversed , without changing the layers . for a twist angle of precisely @xmath0 , the dislocations can be made into a parallel , bipartite lattice of positive and negative dislocations .    from this construction",
    "emerges another unexpected symmetry ; we may view the tgb structure as composed of a bipartite lattice of defects _ along _ the pitch axis . for the @xmath0 structure ,",
    "these defects are straight . applying an additional twist to the @xmath0 structure",
    "yields a twist - grain - boundary phase with twist angle @xmath259 .",
    "the defects along the pitch axis must then twist along with the structure , and geometric considerations suggest that this raises the energy of the structure .",
    "however , we have identified a set of twist angles @xmath102 for which the screw dislocations can be made partially straight , in analogy to the moir phase of columnar liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "the structure for @xmath289 is particularly simple , consisting of triplets of defects braiding around each other .",

    "the defect interactions are not strongly modified by the presence of nonlinearities ( though the layers are ) @xcite , suggesting that our conclusions are robust . finally , we point out that large twist angles are likely to result in a decoupling of the director from the layer normal .",
