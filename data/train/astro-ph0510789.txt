    "our understanding of stellar populations is only as good as the models that are used to interpret the data and the accuracy to which such basic properties as distance and metallicity are known ( assuming that the observations are reliable ) . due to the many factors at play , and the many degeneracies between them , it is virtually impossible to find a unique solution to the values of the various quantities of interest simply by incomparing synthetic and observed color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "the lack of a rigorous theory for super - adiabatic convection , in particular , makes it very risky to place too much reliance on predicted effective temperatures , in both an absolute and relative sense ( especially at metallicities quite different from solar ) .",
    "this is why there has long been a general consensus that ages are best derived from computed turnoff ( to ) luminosity versus age relations ( because to luminosities are predicted to be nearly independent of convection theory ; e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it has become clear that there must be some process(es ) ( e.g. , turbulence ) at work in the envelopes of lower mass , metal - poor stars as , otherwise , it is not possible to explain either the variation of li with @xmath0 in field halo dwarfs ( see @xcite ) or the lack of any detectable difference in the chemical compositions of to and red - giant - branch ( rgb ) stars in such globular clusters ( gcs ) as ngc@xmath26397 and 47 tucanae ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the extent to which diffusive processes are inhibited has ramifications for the predicted difference in @xmath0 between the to and lower rgb ( @xcite ) that are quite similar to those caused by variations in age , [ fe / h ] , and [ o / fe ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the interpretation of the length ( and slope ) of the subgiant branch very complicated indeed .",
    "further uncertainties , on the theoretical side , can be attributed to the low - temperature opacities , which can alter both the location and the slope of the rgb , and to the treatment of the atmospheric layers .",
    "it is conventional to adopt either a gray or scaled - solar @xmath4@xmath5 relation to describe the atmospheric structure and to integrate the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium in conjunction with this relation to derive the pressure boundary condition that is used to construct stellar models .",
    "such a procedure is bound to lead to systematic errors in the predicted effective temperatures because a fixed @xmath4@xmath5 relation is certainly inappropriate for stars of all masses , metallicities , and evolutionary states .",
    "a better approach would be to use proper model atmospheres to provide the outer boundary conditions for stellar models , as well as the color@xmath0 relations that are used to transpose the models from the theoretical to the observed plane .",
    "however , this opens the door to the many uncertainties inherent in model atmosphere computations and thereby to further sources of systematic error .",
    "it is clear from the plots provided by @xcite that the recent color transformations based , in part , on model atmospheres by @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite differ considerably from each other , but it is not obvious whose calculations are the most realistic ones",
    ".    added to this depressing situation is the fact that the photometric data themselves may have both zero - point and systematic errors ; and certainly the reddenings , distances , and chemical compositions of even the simplest stellar populations ( like gcs ) are not as well constrained as they need to be .",
    "for instance , as shown by @xcite , current predictions for the luminosities of horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars , which are one of the favored  standard candles \" for distance determinations , do not agree at all well . moreover , it is not uncommon to find 0.20.4 dex variations in the [ fe / h ] ( and [ o / fe ] ) values derived by different workers . in the case of ngc@xmath24590 ( m@xmath268 ) , for example , recent metallicity estimates range from [ fe / h ] @xmath6 ( @xcite ) to @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "such differences can have huge implications for the comparisons of isochrones with photometric data .    from time to time",
    ", suggestions are made that completely objective techniques should be used to deduce the properties of stellar populations .",
    "perhaps the first such suggestion was made by @xcite , who devised a statistical  goodness of fit \" criterion to determine the values of @xmath8 , age , [ fe / h ] , @xmath9 , and @xmath1 ( where the latter is the usual mixing - length parameter ) from fits of isochrones to the main sequence ( ms ) , to , and subgiant ( sgb ) portions of observed cmds .",
    "not surprisingly , given the many potential problems described above , they concluded that ,  in practice , the results are more sensitive to unknown calibration effects , and to uncertainties in the theoretical modelling of convection and stellar atmospheres , than to formal errors in the fits \" .",
    "one should not expect meaningful results to be obtained if the sizes and shapes of isochrones play the dominant role in determining which isochrone provides the best match to a given cmd , whether or not a least - squares fitting method is used .",
    "similar ideas have been proposed recently by @xcite , but with the important difference that the information which is subjected to a least - squares analysis is the variation in the numbers of stars along the principal sequences of an observed cmd .",
    "this variation reflects the changes in the evolutionary timescales in different parts of the h ",
    "r diagram , which is widely considered to be a more robust prediction of stellar models ( with good reason ) than , in particular , surface temperatures . however , we note that theoretical luminosity functions ( lfs ) appear to have such a weak sensitivity to [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath10/fe ] , and age ( see @xcite ) that they can not be used to determine these quantities .",
    "( as shown in the same study , lfs may provide a way of determining the helium abundance in a star cluster or of detecting whether member stars have been able to retain significant rotational angular momenta throughout their evolution . )",
    "there was some hope that the color distributions of subgiant - branch stars could be used to determine distance - independent absolute ages for globular clusters ( see @xcite ) , but a follow - up study by p.  a.  bergbusch ( in preparation ) has found that , here too , the sensitivity of so - called  color functions \" ( cfs ) to quantities of interest is likely too low to make this approach competitive with other methods .",
    "for instance , preliminary indications are that gc ages derived from cfs have @xmath11 uncertainties of at least @xmath12 gyr . as a result of such work",
    ", it seems doubtful that any major breakthroughs will be forthcoming from efforts ( like that by @xcite ) which are based on predictions of the numbers of stars along isochrones .",
    "the simplest stellar populations ( open clusters , gcs ) provide the best tests of stellar models ( along with well observed binary stars , and field stars with accurately determined distances and chemical compositions ) , and they will continue to do so as our understanding of the physics of stars and the basic properties of such stellar systems improves over time . indeed , it is largely as a result of work on star clusters that the deficiencies of current stellar models are revealed ( e.g. , the need for convective core overshooting in models of intermediate - mass stars ; see the review by @xcite ) .",
    "they also provide the means to  calibrate \" stellar models so that the latter predict , for instance , the right ms and rgb slopes .",
    "it makes no sense to try to interpret the observations for complex stellar populations , such as the magellanic clouds and dwarf spheroidal galaxies , using stellar models that are incapable of reproducing the cmds of simple stellar populations to within some reasonable tolerance .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to review recent work that has been carried out at the university of victoria to try to produce a set of models ( @xcite ) having well constrained temperatures and colors ( see vc03 ) , in the hope that they will offer new and/or improved insights into the stellar content of complex stellar populations .",
    "hopefully this work will provide an instructive example of the degree to which predicted temperatures can be trusted and of how observations may be used to calibrate the colors of stellar models for lower mass stars ( in particular ) over a wide range in metal abundance .",
    "the hyades has long been a pillar of stellar astronomy and of efforts to establish the extragalactic distance scale because its distance can be determined by direct geometric means . as a result of _ hipparcos _ secular and trigonometric parallaxes , its color@xmath13 diagrams have been established to unprecedented precision over @xmath14 magnitudes of its main sequence ( see @xcite ; vc03 ) . moreover , both its metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath15 ) and helium abundance ( just slightly subsolar ) are known to high accuracy ; the former from high - resolution spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the latter from analyses of its binary stars ( @xcite ; vc03 ) .",
    "a further advantage of the hyades over many other systems is that it suffers from negligible foreground reddening .",
    "because so many of its properties involve little uncertainty , the hyades obviously provides a fundamental test of stellar models .",
    "its main deficiency in this regard is that it is too young to have an extended giant branch , and consequently , does not contrain models for low - gravity stars .    for this reason , and because hyades stars are super - metal - rich , vc03 opted to rely on m@xmath267 to derive the color@xmath0 relations for stars having [ fe / h ] @xmath3 , and to use the hyades as a secondary check ( see below ) of the color transformations so obtained .",
    "m@xmath267 has a well - defined cmd ( @xcite ) , its metallicity is close to [ fe / h ] @xmath16 according to the results of high - resolution spectroscopy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and there is general agreement that its reddening is within 0.01 mag of @xmath17 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster helium content is not known , but presumably it is close to that of the sun given the similarity in metal abundance .",
    "the calculation of a standard solar model provides the default value of @xmath9 for solar abundance stars ( as well as the value of the mixing - length parameter , @xmath1 , that is assumed for models of stars in all other parts of the h - r diagram ) .",
    "this estimate of @xmath18 , together with an adopted helium enrichment law ( e.g. , @xmath19 ; see vandenberg et al .",
    "2005 ) provide the means to determine the helium abundance that is to be assumed at other metallicities .    as the blanketing in the @xmath20 bandpass is much more severe than in @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "one expects that the @xmath23 colors predicted by model atmospheres will be less trustworthy than @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , it is comforting to find that the latter , when derived from marcs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and kurucz ( @xcite ) model atmospheres , are in very good agreement for dwarf stars having [ fe / h ] @xmath25 and temperatures above @xmath26 k. this is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "furthermore , when the color transformations ( from either source ) are applied to models that allow for convective core overshooting , it is found that a 4.0 gyr isochrone for [ fe / h ] @xmath16 ( and @xmath27 ) provides a very good match to the upper ms and to of m@xmath267 ( see figure 2 , which is reproduced from vc03 ) . in order for that isochrone to provide a good fit of the entire cmd ,",
    "the model - atmosphere - based colors for lower ms and rgb stars were arbitrarily corrected , as necessary .",
    "( however , as discussed below , there is considerable justification for such adjustments . )",
    "vc03 found that the fit of the same isochrone to @xmath28 observations of m@xmath267 ( by montgomery et al .",
    "1993 ) was much more problematic : the synthetic colors based on marcs model atmospheres seemed to give results that were consistent with the fit to @xmath29 data only very near the turnoff , while those derived from kurucz model atmospheres were too red . in order for the 4 gyr isochrone to reproduce the observed [ @xmath30diagram",
    ", vc03 chose to apply whatever corrections to the theoretical color transformations seemed to be necessary .",
    "however , it turned out that the resultant @xmath31@xmath0 relation for the ms stars in m@xmath267 agrees very well with what is perhaps the best empirical relation which has been derived to date for dwarfs having close to the solar metallicity ( that by @xcite ) . as shown in figure 3 , there are no significant differences between the two relationships over a large range in temperature ( or color ) .",
    "note that the values of @xmath32 implied by the vc03 and sekiguchi & fukugita color transformations are , respectively , 0.637 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath33 .",
    "although the superb fit of the 4 gyr isochrone to the m@xmath267 cmd obtained by vc03 ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) was contrived , a virtually identical fit to the lower main sequence would be obtained using the @xcite transformations .",
    "thus , the adjustments that vc03 applied to the synthetic colors in order for the models to match the ms of m@xmath267 are not at all _ ad hoc _ : they are _ needed _ , in fact , to satisfy empirical constraints .",
    "it then follows that , in order to reproduce the observed @xmath23 versus @xmath24 relation ( i.e. , as defined by the cluster dwarf stars ) , the corrections to the synthetic @xmath24 colors adopted by vc03 ( essentially the difference between the solid and dashed curves in fig .",
    "2 ) are also necessary .",
    "[ other considerations went into the determination of the color transformations for the faintest ms stars ( see vc03 ) , which resulted in the isochrone that was fitted to the m@xmath267 cmd being too red at @xmath34 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the correct explanation for this discrepancy is not clear . ]",
    "as far as the transformations given by vc03 for giants are concerned , it is evident in fig .  2 that the difference between the adopted @xmath35@xmath0 relations and those derived from kurucz model atmospheres are not large ( except near the rgb tip ) .",
    "moreover , as shown by vc03 ( see their fig .",
    "27 ) , the predicted temperatures along the isochrone used to fit the m@xmath267 cmd agree very well with those derived from the empirical relations between @xmath36 and @xmath0 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since there are no obvious problems with the predicted temperatures , the adjustments to the synthetic @xmath23 and @xmath24 color indices adopted by vc03 in order for the models to match the colors of the cluster giants are readily justified .",
    "strong support for this _ calibration _ of of the colors for solar metallicity stars came from a follow - up study by @xcite , who found that they were able to obtain a completely consistent fit of the same isochrone to @xmath37 data for m@xmath267 using their semi - empirical transformations to the strmgren photometric system .",
    "the reason why this is such an encouraging finding is that stellar models played no role in the development of their color@xmath0 relations .",
    "because its properties are so well determined ( as noted at the beginning of this section ) , the hyades provides the best available constraint on the color transformations appropriate to super - metal - rich dwarf stars .",
    "vc03 set up color tables for [ fe / h ] @xmath38 using the dependence of the various color indices on [ fe / h ] predicted by model atmospheres as a guide , and then refined them so that interpolations between these tables and those for [ fe / h ] @xmath25 enabled a computed isochrone for the hyades metallicity to match the cluster cmd .",
    "the result of this exercise is shown in figure 4 . in this case ,",
    "as well , there is independent support for the color@xmath0 relations so obtained .",
    "@xcite had previously developed their own semi - empirical transformations , completely independently of theoretical stellar models .",
    "as shown by vc03 , their results also agree very well with the @xcite relation between @xmath23 and @xmath0 for solar abundance stars  and if their color table for [ fe / h ] @xmath38 is substituted for the one derived by vc03 , and the isochrone appropriate to the hyades is transposed to the observed plane using the revised color transformations , the result is the dashed curve in fig .",
    "the differences between it and the solid curve are clearly not very significant . the color@xmath0 relations for [ fe / h ] @xmath39 by both vc03 and lejeune et al .",
    "are appear to be quite robust .",
    "the calibration of the color transformations for stars having [ fe / h ] @xmath25 has the distinct advantage that the temperature scale of stellar models can be constrained using the sun . ensuring that the models reproduce one point on the h - r diagram does not , however ,",
    "imply that they will agree elsewhere .",
    "differences in the assumed physics , boundary conditions , and the metal abundance mixture , as well as the treatment ( or not ) of diffusive processes , among other things , will all affect the values of @xmath9 and @xmath1 that are derived from a standard solar model .",
    "this ( and any differences in the assumed physics ) will have implications for , e.g. , the location of the giant branch of a computed track relative to its ms location .",
    "but just how large would one expect these differences to be ?",
    "the answer to this question is given in figure 5 , which compares the evolutionary tracks computed for the sun by several researchers ( as noted ) using their own codes .",
    "( the goal here was not to compare the output of the different evolutionary codes when as close to the same input physics is assumed , but rather to illustrate the variations in the solar tracks that result from the net effect of differences in the codes , adopted metallicities , and input assumptions . )",
    "some relevant information about these tracks is provided in table 1 , including , in particular , the age at the tip of the rgb .",
    "needless to say , it is very comforting to find that the predicted ages agree so well .",
    "cccccc code & @xmath40 & diffusion ? & @xmath9 & @xmath1 & age + cassisi & 0.01981 & yes & 0.2734 & 1.89 & 12.10 + girardi & 0.01900 & no & 0.2730 & 1.68 & 12.25 + vandenberg & 0.01880 & no & 0.2768 & 1.90 & 12.18 + weiss & 0.01998 &",
    "yes & 0.2754 & 1.74 & 12.07 + yi & 0.01810 & yes & 0.2670 & 1.74 & 12.03 +    it is apparent in fig .  5 that the largest differences occur near the tip of the rgb , where the tracks span a range of @xmath41 in @xmath42 at a fixed @xmath43 .",
    "much of this can be attributed to the diversity in the adopted values of @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the tracks computed by cassisi and by vandenberg assume the highest value of the mixing - length parameter and , consistent with expectations , their rgbs are hotter than those computed by the other workers .",
    "( it is , however , a little surprising that these two tracks agree so well given that one allows for diffusive processes , but the other does not  see table 1 .",
    "there must be compensating effects due to other factors ; e.g. , the assumed @xmath40 . )",
    "the track by girardi assumes the lowest value of @xmath1 , and it is the coolest track at the base of the rgb ( as it should be , all else being equal ) , though it ends up close the middle of the five tracks near the rgb tip ( which also indicates that other factors must be having an impact ) . still , the level of agreement is quite satisfactory between the different computations .",
    "indeed , all of the tracks probably comply with current constraints on the temperatures of solar abundance giants to within their uncertainties .",
    "they should also be able to reproduce the cmds of m@xmath267 and the hyades quite satisfactorily , simply by employing slightly different transformations than those reported by vc03 .",
    "indeed , it would be interesting to see how much of a discrepancy between theory and observation would be found if the same color@xmath0 relations were used by all the different grids of isochrones currently in use . of course",
    ", in the case of m@xmath267 , in particular , there is enough leeway in the chemical composition and reddening that comparably good fits to the cluster photometry could well be obtained using most of the available sets of models if , e.g. , somewhat different metallicities were assumed .",
    "not having an extremely metal - poor counterpart to the sun that can be similarly used as a high - precision calibration point , or a low - metallicity star cluster whose properties are known to exceedingly high accuracy , makes it very difficult to assess the reliability of the temperatures and colors predicted by stellar models at low @xmath40 . as discussed below , the temperatures determined for field population ii dwarfs having good distance estimates from _ hipparcos _ can sometimes vary by up to 100150 k , depending on how they are derived .",
    "this is quite comparable to the uncertainties in @xmath0 that are found for field and gc giants from infrared photometry .",
    "coupled with the @xmath44 dex uncertainties in [ fe / h ] that exist for many objects , it is relatively easy for stellar models to satisfy many , if not most , observational constraints .",
    "all that may be needed to accomplish this is to choose a particular metallicity scale  e.g. , that by @xcite in preference to the one by @xcite , or _",
    "vice versa _ , in the case of galactic gcs .",
    "it is fair to say that significant improvements to the prediction of the temperatures and colors of metal - poor stars may not be possible until we can confidently measure their chemical compositions to within at least @xmath45 dex .",
    "we are still a long ways from achieving that .",
    "this section will bring to the fore some of the difficulties , apparent inconsistencies , etc .",
    ", that hinder further progress at the present time . on the one hand , it is very encouraging that model - atmosphere - based color@xmath46 relations appear to fine for solar metallicity stars warmer than @xmath475500 k. one would naively expect that they should do at least as well at lower metal abundances given the concomitant decrease in the blanketing of stellar atmospheres .",
    "on the other hand , predicted temperatures undoubtedly suffer from systematic errors that are not easily quantified .",
    "consequently , it is not clear that stellar models which are transposed to the observational plane using synthetic color@xmath0 relations will accurately reproduce the properties of real metal - poor stars .",
    "( even when there appears to be good agreement between theory and observations , the possibility exists that errors in the various factors that play a role have conspired to produce it . )",
    "the obvious first step in testing the available color transformations that apply to stars of low metallicity is to simply try them out . as illustrated in figure 6",
    ", the @xmath35@xmath0 relations derived from marcs and kurucz model atmospheres for [ fe / h ] @xmath48 agree quite well in a systematic sense , though kurucz colors are redder by @xmath490.03 mag over most of the ranges in temperature and gravity that have been considered therein .",
    "( the differences in the predicted @xmath23 color indices from the two sources tend to be somewhat larger , and to be stronger functions of @xmath0 and @xmath50 ; see fig .  3 by vc03 .",
    ") it is difficult to say which of the two sets of transformations is the most realistic one .",
    "comparisons of isochrones with observed cmds may indicate a clear preference , but that could well be more of a reflection on the models than on the color transformations . in effect , choosing to use a particular set of color@xmath0 relations from among several possible alternatives is equivalent to _ calibrating _ the stellar models so that they yield a particular interpretation of , e.g. , the data for a few key stars or star clusters .",
    "( only when the same model atmospheres are used to evaluate the surface boundary conditions of the stellar interior models _ and _ to accomplish their transformation to the various observational planes can it be claimed that they represent a purely theoretical prediction . )    for this reason , it is important to choose the  calibrating \" objects very carefully . among the most metal - deficient gcs",
    ", m@xmath268 provides perhaps the best benchmark because it has well - defined cmds ( @xcite ) based on observations taken in three different bandpasses ( @xmath51 ) during the same run and subjected to the same reduction and standardization procedures .",
    "its reddening is fairly low  @xmath52 according to the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) dust maps  and , at least until recently , its metallicity has not been the subject of much controversy . on the @xcite scale , it has [ fe / h ] @xmath53 , while @xcite obtained [ fe / h ] @xmath6 from high - resolution spectroscopy of cluster giants .",
    "unfortunately , a metallicity near @xmath54 has not been found by @xcite from their analysis of the equivalent widths of fe@xmath2ii lines : they obtained [ fe / h ] @xmath55 .",
    "the consequent uncertainty in the metal abundance of m@xmath268 obviously makes any comparison of its cmd with stellar models rather insecure .    still , it is worthwhile to proceed and to explore the implications of the isochrones computed by @xcite , in particular , as an instructive example . throughout this study ,",
    "the adopted distance modulus for any gc that is considered will be based on a fit of a zahb locus calculated by @xcite to the lower bound of the distribution of cluster hb stars . according to the recent work by @xcite and by @xcite , the luminosities of the rr lyrae stars in these systems , as derived from analyses of their pulsational properties , are close to those predicted by the vandenberg et al .",
    "models . indeed , as will become apparent below , zahb - based distance estimates agree quite well with those determined using other methods .      if the evolutionary calculations for [ @xmath10/fe ] @xmath56 and [ fe / h ] @xmath57 are converted to the observational planes using the transformations from marcs and kurucz model atmospheres , and overlayed onto the m@xmath268 cmds assuming @xmath52 and @xmath58 , the results shown in figure 7 are obtained .",
    "the solid curves , which employ the color@xmath0 relations from marcs atmospheric models , clearly provide the best match to the cluster cmd .",
    "if kurucz colors are used , the isochrones are generally too red ( at least for the adopted cluster parameters ) ; and while most of the discrepancies on the [ @xmath59plane appear to be consistent with a small zero - point shift , which would not be a serious concern , the fit of the isochrones to the cluster fiducial on the [ @xmath30diagram is much more problematic .",
    "granted , the computed rgbs are still a bit too red when marcs transformations are adopted , but the differences are small enough that it might easily be a mistake to attribute them to errors in the predicted temperatures and/or the color@xmath60 relations",
    ". the remaining discrepancies may instead be a consequence of , e.g. , the assumed cluster properties ( reddening , distance , chemical composition ) not being quite right .",
    "it is noteworthy that very similar interpretations of the data are found in both panels of fig .  7 and that , if the distance is set using the hb , the lower ms of m@xmath268 is well matched by the models .",
    "[ as pointed out by vc03 , comparable consistency is not obtained if the lejeune et al .",
    "( 1998 ) transformations are used .",
    "either there are some problems with the latter or with the m@xmath268 observations . ]",
    "if , for instance , m@xmath268 is significantly more metal poor than [ fe / h ] @xmath61 , then the hb stars should be somewhat brighter if they conform to theoretical expectations , implying an increased distance modulus , and the lower ms stars would lie above the zams for the lower metallicity . in this case ,",
    "redder color transformations would be needed . to be sure , it is also possible that m@xmath268 actually has both a lower metal abundance _ and _ a shorter distance than assumed , in which case , an even better fit to the cluster cmd than that shown in fig",
    ".  7 might be found using the same marcs color transformations .",
    "( a lower metallicity isochrone for the same or slightly higher age will have a bluer rgb as well as a reduced difference in color between the turnoff and the rgb . )",
    "these few comments serve to illustrate some of the difficulties that are encountered when trying to establish the color@xmath60 relations for very metal poor stars using observational constraints that have appreciable uncertainties .",
    "it goes without saying that any fine - tuning of the color transformations to obtain a  perfect \" match to the cmd of m@xmath268 ( or any other globular cluster ) can not be justified",
    ". what is encouraging is that , without applying any corrections at all to the transformations from marcs model atmospheres , it is possible to get quite a respectable fit of isochrones to the entire cmd of a very metal - deficient gc like m@xmath268 , and to have a consistent interpretation of both @xmath28 and @xmath29 data .",
    "indeed , vc03 found that similar good agreement could be obtained for more metal - rich systems , provided that some adjustments were made to the predicted colors for upper rgb and lower ms stars : the higher the metallicity , the warmer the temperature at which these corrections seemed to be necessary .",
    "however , such a trend is not unexpected given that substantial corrections to the color@xmath0 relations are needed at rather warm temperatures if models for [ fe / h ] @xmath3 are to satisfy empirical constraints ( see  2 ) .",
    "importantly , no adjustments were applied to the theoretical color transformations at temperatures appropriate to turnoff stars at any metallicity . indeed , the main effect of correcting the synthetic colors for cooler stars is to ensure that the predicted rgb and ms slopes are in good correspondence with those observed .",
    "models that fail to satisfy at least these constraints will not be very useful for the interpretation of the photometric data for complex stellar populations .",

    "8 , the fine agreement between theory and observations which is evident therein would provide a strong argument in support of the colors of the models that have been used in both an absolute and relative sense ( provided that , e.g. , the photometric zero - points and reddenings are accurate ) .",
    "unfortunately , current estimates of the metallicity of m@xmath292 vary from [ fe / h ] @xmath66 ( @xcite ) to @xmath67 ( @xcite ) .",

    "even though there are good reasons to favor the kraft & ivans determination ( e.g. , being based on fe ii lines , their results are largely unaffected by departures from lte ) , it is not impossible that m@xmath292 has a metallicity as high as [ fe / h ] @xmath69 , or even higher .",
    "recent work on the local subgiant , hd@xmath2140283 , which is one of the best observed field population ii stars , has called into question metal abundance determinations based on 1-d model atmospheres .",
    "( the location of this star has been plotted in fig .  8 to support the zahb - based distance to m@xmath292 .",
    "this star should be slightly brighter than the cluster subgiants at the same color , by approximately the amount shown , if it is the same age as , but slightly more metal poor than , the globular cluster . )",
    "whereas nearly all spectroscopic studies of hd@xmath2140283 over the years have found [ fe / h ] @xmath70 ( see , e.g. , the [ fe / h ] catalogue by @xcite ) , @xcite have suggested from model atmospheres which take 3-d effects into account that a reduction of @xmath71 k in the @xmath0 usually adopted for this star together with an assumed [ fe / h ] @xmath61 result in much improved agreement between the predicted and observed spectra .",
    "it remains to be seen what the implications of the more sophisticated model atmospheres will be for the metallicity of m@xmath292 , but an upward revision is conceivable .    the possible ramifications of 3-d model atmospheres notwithstanding , there is a general consensus that 47 tuc has an iron content very close to [ fe / h ] @xmath72 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) this poses a bit of a problem for the models plotted in fig .  8 , which indicate that a consistent interpretation of the hb and ms observations is obtained only if the cluster metallicity is [ fe / h ] @xmath73 .",
    "there are at least a couple of possible ways of explaining this ( admittedly small ) discrepancy .",
    "first , based on a careful analysis of published photometry for 47 tuc , using the secondary cluster standards established by @xcite , @xcite have suggested that , in the mean , the @xcite observations are too blue by @xmath41 mag . indeed , an analogous plot to fig .  8 , but with the 47 tuc fiducial shifted to the red by 0.02 mag , shows that the observed lower ms coincides very well with a that of 12 gyr , [ fe / h ] @xmath74 isochrone if , as required by the fit of the zahb for this metallicity to the cluster hb stars , @xmath75 is assumed .",
    "; @xcite ) and on ms fits to field subdwarfs ( @xmath76 ; @xcite ) . ]",
    "( this plot has not been included here because it is already quite obvious from fig .",
    "8 that such a redward adjustment of the 47 tuc cmd would result in a close match to the isochrone for [ fe / h ] @xmath74 . )",
    "errors in the adopted reddening or the model colors could also explain why the deduced [ fe / h ] value from fig .",
    "8 is at variance with spectroscopic metallicity estimates .",
    "for instance , @xcite have recently obtained @xmath77 for 47 tuc , which is @xmath78 mag smaller than the value assumed here .",
    "this supplies approximately one - half of the shift needed to reconcile the cluster cmd with models for [ fe / h ] @xmath79 .",
    "while it is quite possible that the remaining difference can be traced to the color@xmath0 relations that have been used , it is just as likely ( if not more so ) that the isochrones are too red because the effective temperatures predicted by the models for metal - poor stars are too low .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , stellar models that are computed using marcs model atmospheres as boundary conditions will be @xmath80100 k warmer ( depending on the metal abundance and evolutionary state ) than those which assume a scaled - solar @xmath4@xmath5 relation to describe the atmospheric structure .",
    "their results are presented on the [ @xmath30plane in figure 9 .",
    "this shows that evolutionary tracks for @xmath81 stars having [ fe / h ] @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 are 0.0050.02 mag bluer if the surface boundary conditions of the individual stellar models are derived from model atmospheres rather than from integrations of the hydrostatic equation in conjunction with the @xcite @xmath4@xmath5 relation .",
    "( this prediction should be regarded as  preliminary \" as it is based on a small number of model atmospheres that were made available @xmath14 years ago by b.  gustafsson and b.  edvardsson .",
    "a collaborative project with the uppsala group is presently in progress to more fully analyze the impact of using their latest model atmospheres to describe the outermost layers of stellar models . )",
    "the degree to which isochrones , as opposed to evolutionary tracks , are affected remains to be seen , but it seems probable that predicted turnoff color versus age relations will be bluer by one- or two - hundredths of a magnitude ( at a fixed age ) if the effects of proper model atmospheres are taken into account .    while such offsets seem desirable for our understanding of 47 tuc ( at the present time , anyway ) , they would appear to pose a problem for the most metal - deficient systems .",
    "9 suggests that all of the isochrones in fig .  8 more metal poor than @xmath86 should be shifted to the blue by at least 0.01 mag .",
    "however , any blueward correction of the isochrones appropriate to m@xmath292 ( and m@xmath268 , for that matter ) would have the consequence that a consistent explanation of its cmd ( i.e. , of both its hb and ms stars ) would be possible only if a somewhat higher metallicity were assumed ( closer to [ fe / h ] @xmath48 than to @xmath87 ) , which would conflict with current spectroscopic estimates . to be sure , with so many sources of uncertainty ,",
    "it is easily possible that errors in one or more quantities are compensating for errors in others . being able to predict the colors of stars of any metallicity to within @xmath49 mag could well be the best that we can do ( and will do for the foreseeable future ) , and once that point is reached , further debate may not be very meaningful .",
    "realistically , one can not say with any certainty that there is , or is not , a problem with the comparison between theory and observations presented in fig .  8 .",
    "@xcite fiducials for m@xmath23 and m@xmath25 are compared with a set of 12 gyr isochrones spanning the range in metallicity , @xmath88 [ fe / h ] @xmath89 , in figure 10 , which is very similar to the lower panel in fig .  8 except that the [ @xmath59plane is considered . the fiducial sequence for m@xmath268 from fig .",
    "7 has been replotted here to reiterate that it can be reproduced quite well by models for [ fe / h ] @xmath61  i.e. , for the metal abundance derived by @xcite .",
    "the assumed reddenings are from the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) dust maps and , although not shown , the adopted distance modulus in each case is such that a theoretical zahb , for that metallicity which is implied by the overlay of the predicted and observed lower main sequences , provides a good fit to the lower bound of the distribution of cluster hb stars .",
    "thus , the models provide consistent fits to the ms and hb stars in m@xmath23 and m@xmath25 only if their metallicities are [ fe / h ] @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "this is an intriguing result because these estimates are not in good agreement with the [ fe / h ] values derived by @xcite using high - resolution spectroscopy ( even though there is no such conflict in the case of the most metal - deficient clusters , like m@xmath268 ) .",
    "according to carretta & gratton , the iron abundance of m@xmath23 is [ fe / h ] @xmath92 , while that of m@xmath25 is @xmath93 .",
    "however , it is well known that , although the @xcite and @xcite [ fe / h ] scales are very similar below [ fe / h ] @xmath61 and above @xmath94 , they tend to differ by @xmath44 dex at intermediate metallicities . in fact , the [ fe / h ] values of m@xmath23 and m@xmath25 as inferred from the models ( see fig .",
    "10 ) agree very well with the zinn & west determinations ; namely , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , metal abundances derived from fe ii lines are close to the mean of the carretta ",
    "gratton and zinn  west results : @xcite have obtained [ fe / h ] @xmath97 for m@xmath23 and @xmath98 for m@xmath25 . ( consistency with the findings of kraft & ivans would be obtained if the isochrones were adjusted to the blue by as little as 0.010.015 mag . )",
    "it is clearly very hard to assess the accuracy of the temperatures and colors of stellar models from comparisons of isochrones with observed cmds until , at the very least , metallicity determinations are placed on a much firmer footing .",
    "even then , uncertainties in the basic cluster properties ( distance , reddening , and photometric zero - points ) limit what can be done .",
    "perhaps the main value of fig .",
    "10 is to show how precisely everything must be known in order to obtain the correct interpretation ( whatever that may be ) of any given cmd : note that the separation in the lower ms segments of the isochrones at @xmath99 is only @xmath100 mag in @xmath24 for a 1 dex change in [ fe / h ] .      when @xcite determined the ages of a sample of 26 gcs , zahb - based distance moduli and reddenings from the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) dust maps were adopted ( as in this study ) . on the basis of these assumptions , the observed cmds were converted to [ @xmath30- or [ @xmath59diagrams .",
    "the age of each cluster was then obtained by first adjusting the isochrones for the assumed metallicity in color until the predicted ms overlaid that observed , and then noting which isochrone best reproduced the location of the turnoff and the subgiant branch .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that errors in the model temperatures or colors , or problems with the photometric zero - points or reddening , do not affect the derived age .",
    "as noted in the plots provided by vandenberg , the model colors were sometimes adjusted to the blue and sometimes to the red , by typically @xmath49 mag . moreover ,",
    "the corrections needed to fit @xmath28 and @xmath29 photometry for the same cluster were not always in the same direction .",
    "only for a few clusters , like m@xmath268 ( @xcite ) , was it possible to obtain consistent interpretations of the data on two different color planes .",
    "( as already noted , walker s @xmath51 observations were taken in the same observing run , and subjected to the same reduction and calibration procedures . )",
    "@xcite , among others , have emphasized the importance of having a homogeneous photometric database ( in their case , to obtain self - consistent relative gc ages ) .",
    "indeed , the lack of homogeneity could well be the main reason why there was no obvious pattern to the corrections that @xcite applied to the isochrones in his investigation .",
    "needless to say , the possibility of zero - point and/or systematic errors in cluster photometry is a real concern for any attempts that are made ( e.g. , that by vc03 ) to use such data to calibrate synthetic colors .",
    "fortunately , p.  b.  stetson ( see @xcite ) is engaged in a monumental , on - going effort to homogenize a large fraction of the @xmath101 ccd photometry that has been acquired by many researchers over the years .",
    "in particular , he is in the process of establishing many  standard fields \" in gcs that can be used for calibration purposes",
    ". given their availability , an obvious question to ask is :  how well are @xcite isochrones , using vc03 color transformations , able to reproduce the cmds defined by his secondary standards in , say , 47 tuc , m@xmath25 , and m@xmath292 ? \" .",
    "the answer to this question , as revealed in figure 11 , is  not as well as one would have hoped \" .",
    "as far as 47 tuc is concerned , the predicted ms ( on both color planes ) is about 0.01 mag too blue , suggesting that models for a slightly higher [ fe / h ] value than @xmath84 would be more appropriate .",
    "( isochrones for [ fe / h ] @xmath74 , which is the next highest metallicity in our grid , provided a less satisfactory fit to the observations than that shown . )",
    "curiously , the rgb segments of the isochrones are 0.010.02 mag too blue on the [ @xmath30plane , but too red by about the same amount on the [ @xmath59diagram .",
    "it is quite possible that these discrepancies are due to minor problems with the color transformations , particularly those for the @xmath23 color index .    the offsets between the computed and observed rgbs are much bigger ( @xmath102 mag ) in the case of m@xmath25 .",
    "they are larger than any found in the extensive study of gc cmds by @xcite , though it must be acknowledged that most of his fits of isochrones to photometric data were discrepant in the same sense .",
    "it seems unlikely that the color@xmath0 relations are at the root of this difficulty because the predictions from marcs model atmospheres , which were adopted without appreciable modifications by vc03 for [ fe / h ] values @xmath103 , tend to be bluer than other transformations currently in use ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "either the model temperatures along the giant branch are too cool , which is possible ( though they appear to be consistent with empirical constraints , as shown in the next section ) , or our understanding of m@xmath25 is somehow lacking ( assuming , of course , that the cmds of m@xmath25 presented in fig .",
    "11 are trustworthy ) .",
    "isochrones for a lower metallicity , a higher oxygen abundance , or an increased age should , for instance , provide a better match to the observed ( small ) difference in color between the to and the rgb .",
    "it is , perhaps , especially disheartening that isochrones which had previously provided a superb match to the cmd of m@xmath292 by stetson & harris ( 1988 ; see fig .",

    "11 , the observed ms lies slightly to the red of the isochrones while the cluster giants are , in the mean , @xmath49 mag bluer than the models .",
    "of particular concern is the fact that , in the [ @xmath59diagram ( see the lower right - hand panel ) , the deviation between the predicted and observed ms of m@xmath292 is in the opposite sense , and the discrepancies along the giant branch are appreciably larger ( though in the same direction as in the left - hand panel ) . thus , the models do not provide consistent interpretations of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 observations . does this",

    "no such inconsistency is found for this cluster , which has a very similar metal abundance as m@xmath292 ) ?",
    "there are clearly some mysteries here that need to be understood .",
    "perhaps the main conclusion to be drawn from this brief examination of the standard field data is that , when using the cmds for gcs to test the predicted colors of stellar models , one must be wary of the very real possibility that the observations suffer from significant zero - point and/or systematic errors .",
    "a valuable test of the predicted temperatures of giants is provided by empirical @xmath104@xmath0 relations . due to the extensive work by @xcite , fiducial sequences on the @xmath105plane",
    "have been derived for many star clusters from @xmath36 photometry .",
    "those reported by @xcite for m@xmath292 , m@xmath23 , 47 tuc , and m@xmath267 are plotted in figure 12 , together with the rgb segments of the isochrones that appeared in fig .",
    "( the distance moduli adopted by frogel et al have been corrected by @xmath106 mag , or less , to be consistent with the zahb - based distances that have been adopted throughout this study .",
    "because the giant branches rise so steeply , such adjustments have no more than minor consequences for the comparisons with theoretical models . )",
    "it is immediately apparent that the predicted and  observed \" rgb slopes are nearly the same , which suggests that the value of the mixing - length parameter , @xmath1 , does not vary by much , if at all , during the first ascent of the giant branch .",
    "furthermore , the empirically derived temperatures for m@xmath292 , m@xmath23 , and 47 tuc are well reproduced by the models for [ fe / h ] @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , respectively , though the size of the @xmath11 error bar is large enough to accommodate larger or smaller [ fe / h ] values by @xmath1100.3 dex .",
    "there is clearly no conflict with current spectroscopic determinations , and hence no indication that @xmath1 varies with metallicity .",
    "indeed , much tighter constraints on the temperatures of giants are needed if they are to provide more exacting tests of stellar models .    as mentioned in  2 ( also see vc03 ) ,",
    "the predicted temperatures along the giant - branch segment of the 4 gyr isochrone used to fit the m@xmath267 cmd ( see fig .",
    "2 ) agree well with those determined from @xmath36 photometry and the latest available @xmath104@xmath0 relations ( bessell et al .  1998 ;",

    "( 1981 ; the _ open circles _ ) nearly 25 years ago .",
    "the agreement between the two is obviously quite good , which indicates that the transformation between @xmath36 and @xmath0 has withstood the test of time rather well .",
    "although our comparisons of isochrones with the cmds of m@xmath23 and m@xmath25 ( see figs .  10 and 11 ) indicate a preference for the @xcite [ fe / h ] scale over that by @xcite in the intermediate metal - poor regime , this is not a consequence of the color@xmath60 relations that have been used .",
    "indeed , the vc03 transformations are completely consistent with those used by r.  g.  gratton and colleagues to determine the temperatures of the population ii subdwarf standards with [ fe / h ] values between @xmath111 and @xmath54 that have often been used to derive gc distances via the ms fitting technique .",
    "as shown in figure 13 , the @xmath23 colors that are determined from interpolations in the vc03 color tables for the values of @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] derived by @xcite and @xcite for some of the best observed subdwarfs ( also see @xcite ) , using @xmath50 values from stellar models , are in exceedingly good agreement with the observed colors .",
