    "for the important steps of selecting cuts for the dispersion relation and borel transformation we refer the reader to the main paper @xcite .",
    "we shall quote here an intermediate expression , @xmath52 that relates an on - shell matrix element to an integral over an off - shell correlation function .",
    "@xmath53 is a closed path on the physical riemann sheet that does not contain any singularities such as poles and cuts .",
    "@xmath54 is of the same type except that it contains the pole of the matrix element . at this stage",
    "the relation is exact but admittedly rather cryptic . in sum rules",
    "the analytic structure of the correlation functions is usually such that the singularities are on the real line . in the case at hand though it happens that there is an anomalous threshold extending into the complex plane .",
    "let us explain in more detail : after the reduction to scalar integrals the passarino - veltman function @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) appears in the expression for @xmath57 , c.f . fig .  [",
    "fig : triangle ] .",
    "the fact that this function has an anomalous threshold extending into the lower half - plane , for @xmath58 and appropriate momentum fraction @xmath51 , can be seen in various ways .",
    "first , using the explicit result valid on the real line we can show by uniqueness of analytic continuation from the real line that there must be singularities in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "second , by setting @xmath59 in the dispersion integral we see that its path is deformed into the lower complex plane by analytic continuation of @xmath60 to its physical value @xcite .",
    "the analytic structure of this function is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] for a simplified set of variables .",
    "further to that , the work of klln and wightman @xcite shows that anomalous thresholds are present in the corresponding triangle function of the full theory using a minimal number of axioms .",
    "this almost implies that the anomalous thresholds are present in the full theory : the loophole is that the reduction to a scalar object in the non - perturbative case is not as efficient as for the one - loop case ; thus it could in principle be that the contributions cancel , however this is unlikely and in any case not relevant to our discussion .",
    "the important point is that the @xmath61 $ ] and thus the rest the anomalous branch cut is well above the @xmath62-pole , and the anomalous cut is part of what is usually called the continuum contribution in sum rules . in the following paragraph",

    "let us begin by discussing the simplest case .",
    "for a two - point function of gauge invariant operators , a dispersion representation is in one - to - one correspondence with the insertion of a complete set of states as is explicit in the celebrated klln - lehmann representation @xcite and derivations thereof .",
    "thus the analytic structure in the complex plane of the four momentum invariant has a cut and poles on the real line starting from the lowest state in the spectrum . for correlation functions with three or more fields",
    ", there is no such direct relation .",
    "it seems preferable to think of the analytic structure ( singularity structure ) as a fundamental part of the correlation function rather than as the insertion of a complete set of states . for the dispersion relation , which is essentially an application of cauchy s integral theorem ,",
    "it is immaterial whether the singularities are of the normal or anomalous type .",
    "normal thresholds are related to unitarity , that is to say to the insertion of a complete set of states .",
    "anomalous thresholds do not have such an interpretation .",
    "in fact , the anomalous threshold of the triangle graph in perturbation theory corresponds to the leading landau singularity which in turn amounts to setting all the propagators on the mass shell .",
    "one out of the two solutions @xmath68 of the ( leading ) landau equations turns out to be the end of the anomalous threshold ( fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] ) , whereas the other one is not on the physical sheet .",
    "we should add that determining which riemann - sheet a complex singularity is on is generally a difficult problem .",
    "we refer the reader to reference @xcite for some explicit analytic results .",
    "the results of @xmath57 and @xmath69 are collected in appendices a and c of that reference . amongst all the possible flavour transitions , only four are characteristically different depending on whether the initial meson is neutral or charged and whether it is of the beauty or charm type .",

    "there are seven contributions : @xmath88 g_t^{(s ) } & = & g_t^{(p)}(q^2 )     \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it turns out that ( [ eq : gdec ] ) can be fully reconstructed by knowing the three subparts @xmath89 , @xmath82 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus there are four relations : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the third relation assures a finite decay width in the limit @xmath95 ( as employed here ) @xcite .",
    "the fourth relation is of the large energy effective theory ( leet)-type as found for form factors @xcite , whose origin is explained in appendix a of @xcite using the third relation and a generic ansatz .",
    "furthermore , in the ultra - relativistic approximation @xmath95 , the projections @xmath90 @xmath96 are proportional to each other modulo a replacement of the corresponding da .",
    "thus the results can be understood qualitatively from the plots of @xmath97 and @xmath98 c.f .",

    "it worthwhile to point out that the uncertainties are higher for the charm transitions because of the low scale for @xmath38 .",
    "we shall summarise here a few points of the discussion in chapter 5 of @xcite on comparing the contributions of diagrams @xmath76 of fig .  [",
    "fig : diaa ] in the qcdf and lcsr approaches .",

    "this happens because two propagators behave as @xmath113 c.f .",
    "[ fig : endpoint ] . in lcsr",
    "there is only one propagator with manifest @xmath114-behaviour ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : endpoint ] ) and there is no such term hidden in the loop as it would correspond to a power ir - divergence , and it is known that in four dimensions ir - singularities , whether they are soft or collinear , are at worst of logarithmic nature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus the worst behaviour that we can get is @xmath115 which is integrable , i.e. does not show an endpoint - divergence .",
    "inspection or evaluation eq .",
    "( [ eq : xperp ] ) gives an even milder behaviour with @xmath116 for which we see no particular reason .",
    "the comparison between qcdf and lcsr can be sharpened if the heavy quark scaling @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , as suggested in @xcite , is applied : @xmath120 the logarithmic term indicates that this expression is not expandable in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass .",
    "in fact , the expansion of the density around @xmath121 reveals that @xmath122 in our results .",
    "are the lcsr and the qcdf to be seen on an equal footing when the leading heavy quark scaling behaviour is considered ?",
    "the answer must be no as the former has a sizeable imaginary part whereas the latter is real ( at leading order in @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that lcsr contain additional contributions which are not present in the qcdf computation .",
    "an interpretation of the complex phase as a long distance phenomenon is given in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_p ]",
    ".    in regards to the discussion above it is seems worthwhile to point out that even though qcdf and lcsr are both based on lc - expansions in terms of hard kernels and das they differ on a conceptual level .",
    "qcdf computes physical processes in a direct way and is in that sense very transparent .",
    "lcsr is of an indirect nature as correlation functions are computed in which the matrix element in question appears as a residue of a pole .",
    "the matrix element is then extracted by manipulating the sum rule ( borel transformation ) and considering appropriate kinematical limits . in this sense lcsr",
