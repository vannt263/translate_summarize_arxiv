    "information , not so long ago , used to always mean knowledge _ about something_. even today , under layers of abstraction , that s still the usual meaning .",
    "sure , an agent can be informed of a string of bits ( via some signal ) without knowing what the bits refer to , but at minimum the agent has been informed about the physical signal itself .    quantum theory , however , has led many to question this once - obvious connection between knowlege / information and an underlying reality . not only is our information about a quantum system indistinguishable from our best physical description , but we have failed to come up with a realistic account of what might be going on _ independent _ of our knowledge .",
    "this blurring between information and reality has led to a confusion as to which is more fundamental .",
    "the remarkable `` it from bit '' idea @xcite that _ information _ is more fundamental than reality is motivated by standard quantum theory , but this is a bit suspicious .",
    "after all , there s a long `` instrumentalist '' tradition of only using what we can measure to describe quantum entities , rejecting outright any story of what might be happening when we re not looking . using a theory that only comprises our knowledge of measurement outcomes to justify knowledge as fundamental is almost like wearing rose - tinted glasses to justify that the world is tinted red .",
    "but any such argument quickly runs into the counterargument :  then answer the question : what _ is _ the ( objective ) reality that our information of quantum systems is actually _ about _ ? \" without an answer to this question ( that differs from our original information ) ,  it from bit \" proponents can perhaps claim to win the argument by default .",
    "the only proper rebuttal is to demonstrate that there is some plausible underlying reality , after all .",
    "this is generally thought to be an impossible task , having been ruled out by various `` no - go '' theorems @xcite .",
    "but such theorems are only as solid as their premises , and they all presume a particular sort of independence between the past and the future",
    ". this presumption may be valid in a universe that uses dynamical laws to evolve some initial state into future states , but if `` the universe is not a computer '' @xcite , there is a natural alternative to this dynamic viewpoint .",
    "as argued in last year s essay , instead of the universe solving itself one time - slice at a time , it s possible that it only looks coherent when solved `` all - at - once '' .",
    "this essay aims to demonstrate how this all - at - once perspective naturally recasts our supposedly - complete information about quantum systems into _ incomplete _ information about an underlying , spacetime - based reality .",
    "after some motivation in the next section , a simple model will demonstrate how the all - at - once perspective works for purely spatial systems ( without time ) .",
    "then , applying the same perspective to spacetime systems will reveal a framework that can plausibly serve as a realistic explanation for quantum phenomena .",
    "the result of this analysis will be to dramatically weaken the ",
    "it from bit \" idea , showing that it s possible to have an underlying reality , even in the case of quantum theory .",
    "we may still choose to reject this option , but the mere fact that it is on the table might encourage us _ not _ to redefine information as fundamental  especially as it becomes clear just how poorly - informed we actually are .",
    "the case for discarding dynamics in favor of an all - at - once analysis is best made by analyzing quantum theory @xcite , but it s also possible to frame this argument using the _ other _ pillar of modern physics : einstein s theory of relativity .",
    "the relevant insight is that there is no objective way to slice up spacetime into instants , so we must not assign fundamental significance to any particular slice .",
    "figure 1 is a standard spacetime diagram ( with one dimension of space suppressed ) .",
    "if run forward in time like a movie , this diagram represents two spatial objects that begin at a common past ( c.p . ) and then move apart .",
    "but if viewed all - at - once , the figure instead shows two orange  worldtubes \" that intersect in the past . in relativity ,",
    "as we are about to see , it is best to analyze this picture all - at - once .",
    "the most counter - intuitive feature of special relativity is that there is no objective `` now '' .",
    "simultaneous events for one observer are not simultaneous for another .",
    "no observer is right or wrong ; `` now '' is merely subjective , not an element of reality .",
    "an illustration of this can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "observer # 1 has a  now \" that slices the worldtubes into two white ovals , while observer # 2 has a  now \" that slices the worldtubes into two black ovals .",
    "clearly , they disagree .",
    "this fact implies that any dynamical movie made from a spacetime diagram will incorporate a subjective choice of how to slice it up .",
    "one way to purge this subjectivity is to simply view a spacetime diagram as a single 4d block .",
    "after all , with no objective `` now '' , there is no objective line between the past and the future , meaning there can be no objective difference between them .",
    "such a claim is counter - intuitive , _ but this is a central lesson of relativity . _",
    "the only difference between the future and the past , in this view , is subjective : we do nt ( yet ) know any of our future .",
    "arguments such as  but the future is nt real _ now _ \" are no more meaningful than arguing  over there is nt real right here \" .    a more reasonable fallback for the dynamicist is not to deny that spacetime _ can _ be viewed as a single 4d block , but rather to note that if dynamical equations govern the universe then _ any _ complete spacelike slice suffices to generate the rest of the block ( via dynamical equations ) .",
    "so while no one slice is special , they re all equally valid inputs from which the full universe can be recovered .",
    "taken to an extreme , this viewpoint leads to the notion that the 4d block is filled with redundant permuted copies of the same 3d slice .",
    "it also forbids a number of solutions allowed by general relativity , spacetime geometries warped to such an extent that they only make sense all - at - once .",
    "the other problem with this sliced perspective is that it all but gives up on objectivity . even if it s",
    "_ possible _ to generate the block from a single slice ( a point i ll dispute later on ) , how can one 3d slice truly generate the others if it is a subjective choice ? in figure 1 , if _ both _",
    "the white ovals and the black ovals are different complete descriptions of the same reality , it s the 4d worldtubes they generate that makes them consistent .",
    "the clearest objective reality requires a bigger picture .",
    "this point becomes even clearer when one introduces ( subjective ) uncertainty .",
    "suppose each of the worldtubes in figure 1 represent a ( temporally extended ) shoebox , each containing a single shoe .",
    "also suppose that you knew the shoes were a matched pair , but not which shoe ( r or l ) was in which box ( 1 or 2 ) .",
    "to represent your information about the two boxes after they had separated ( say , the white ovals in figure 1 ) , you might use an equal - probability mix of both possibilities : @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this is not a potential state of reality , but a state in a larger  configuration space \" that weights possibilities that _ do _ fit in spacetime .",
    "note that having less knowledge forces a more complicated description , even if the underlying reality is assuredly either @xmath1 or @xmath2 .    for these restricted - knowledge situations , the all - at - once",
    "viewpoint is invaluable if we are to make sense of what is going on when we open a shoebox and learn which shoe is inside . if we take the dynamic view that we need only keep track of the 3d white ovals in figure 1 to describe the entire 4d system , then @xmath3 might seem to give us everything we need ; from it we can compute outcome probabilities and the correlations between the two boxes . upon learning",
    "that ( say ) the left shoe is in box 1 , we can even update our knowledge of the 3d state @xmath4 to the appropriate @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "but what is lost in this viewpoint is the mechanism for the updating ; if our entire description is that of the 3d white ovals , this updating process might appear nonlocal , as if some spooky influence at box 1 is influencing the reality over at box 2 .",
    "sure , we know that nothing spooky is going on in the case of shoes , but that s only because we already know there s an underlying reality of which @xmath3 represents ( subjective ) _",
    "information_. if the existence of an underlying reality is doubt ( as in quantum theory ) , then analysis of the 3d state @xmath3 can not address whether anything spooky is happening . to resolve that question",
    ", one has to look at the entire 4d structure .",
    "all at once .",
    "in the all - at - once viewpoint , after finding the left shoe in box 1 we update our local knowledge to @xmath6 ( updating occurs when we learn new information ) . but thinking in 4d , we also update our knowledge of the _ past _ ; we now know that that @xmath6 back in the c.p .",
    "this in turn implies @xmath7 back in the c.p , and this allows us to update our knowledge of @xmath7 in the present .",
    "it s the continuous link , via the past , that proves that we did not change the contents of box 2 ; it contained the right shoe all along .",
    "throw away the analysis of the 4d link , and there s no way to be sure .    before moving on , it s worth noting that this classical story can not explain all quantum correlations ; in fact , it s exactly the story ruled out by a no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "such theorems generally start from the classical premise that we can assign subjective probabilities @xmath8 to possible 3d realities , @xmath9 .",
    "states of classical information then naturally take the form @xmath10 $ ] , a function on @xmath11-dimensional configuration space .",
    "( note the probabilities are all subjective ; only one particular @xmath12 is real ; the rest are not . )",
    "the quantum no - go theorems have proven that such a state can not explain quantum measurements without some classically - impossible feature , such as negative probabilities .",
    "the standard thinking is that since any workable version of @xmath4 can not be classical information , it must be a new kind of reality in its own right .",
    "effectively , the standard view extends reality from spacetime to configuration space .",
    "but an alternative option , explored below , is that reality merely requires an extension from 3d to 4d , along with an all - at - once analysis . at this point",
    "it s probably not obvious how anything might change if the @xmath12 s spanned 4d spacetime , but that s because the standard dynamical viewpoint makes any such extension trivial .",
    "( thanks to dynamics , all the interesting information is always encoded in a 3d slice ) . exploring this option",
    "therefore requires jettisoning dynamics .    still , old habits die hard ; it s difficult to think about time without also thinking in terms of dynamical equations .",
    "the 4d block is a good start , but it s time to demonstrate how it can be used to make physical predictions .",
    "fortunately , it s a standard procedure , so straightforward that it s nearly trivial .",
    "physicists know how to do physics without dynamics , because we can analyze 3d systems for which there are no dynamics , by definition .",
    "a particularly useful approach is found in classical statistical mechanics , because in that case we never know the exact microscopic details , allowing us to deal with restricted knowledge situations .",
    "the basic approach works like this .",
    "first , determine the possible underlying realities ; call each one a `` microstate '' @xmath9 .",
    "the key next step is to assign each @xmath9 an equal _ a priori _ probability , @xmath8 .",
    "( initially treat all possible states as equally likely . ) if we learn new information  say , that @xmath13 is ruled out  we set @xmath14 and renormalize the remaining probabilities such that they sum to 1 .",
    "finally , we can determine the probability that the system has any particular feature by simply adding the probabilities of the microstates with that feature .",
    "one _ could _ introduce dynamics on top of this framework , but it s not a logical necessity .        for a simple example that will prove particularly relevant to quantum theory , consider figure 2 .",
    "each circle ( perhaps a coin ) can be in the state heads ( h ) or tails ( t ) , and every line connects two circles .",
    "each line has one of three internal colors ; red , green or blue , but these colors are _ unobservable _ ( they can sometimes be deduced , but not directly measured ) .",
    "the model s only  law \" is that red lines must connect opposite - state circles ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) , while blue and green lines must connect similar - state circles ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) .",
    "consider the following puzzle in the statistical mechanics framework : in figure 2a , if it is known that the bottom circle is @xmath19 , what is the probability that the two circles in the dotted box are in the same state ?",
    "it s easy enough to work out ( see the appendix for details ) that there are 4 microstates where these two circles are @xmath20 , 2 microstates for @xmath21 , 2 for @xmath22 , and only 1 for @xmath23 . by assigning each of these 9 states an equal probability",
    ", it should be evident that there is a 5/9 chance those two circles are the same , and a 4/9 chance that they re different .    for figure 2b ,",
    "the same puzzle is trickier because now there s a fourth circle . in this case , the same style of analysis ( in the appendix ) reveals that the different geometry changes the probabilities . in place of a 5:4 probability ratio , here one finds a 25:16 ratio .",
    "the most interesting example is a further restriction where one _ does not know _ whether the actual geometry is that of figure 2a or 2b .",
    "specifically , one knows that the bottom circle is heads , and that the next two circles are connected , but not whether a fourth circle is connected ( 2b ) , or whether it is not ( 2a ) .",
    "this is not to say there is no fact of the matter ; there _ is _ some particular geometry ",
    "it s just unknown .",
    "this is not quite the same as the unknown circles or links ( which also have some particular state ) , because this model provides no clues as to how to calculate the probability of a _",
    "geometry_. all allowable states may be equally likely , but that does nt help us if we do nt know which states are allowable in the first place . with this further - restricted knowledge , we would most naturally use an even higher - level configuration space to describe the probability of similar states in the dotted box , something like : @xmath24[if 2a then 5/9 ; if 2b then 25/(25 + 16 ) ] .",
    "the next section will explore a crucial mistake that would lead one to conclude that _ no underlying reality exists _ for this statistical - mechanics - based model , despite the fact that an underlying reality does indeed exist ( by construction ) .",
    "then , by applying the above logic to a dynamics - free scenario in space _ and _ time , we ll see how we are making this same mistake in quantum theory .",
    "given the previous model , one might reasonably want to analyze a  slice \" of the system ( the dotted box ) independent from the rest . but this can only be done by expanding the description of the box such that it includes _ each _ possible external geometry  effectively removing the  ifs \" from @xmath25 .",
    "then , one can later use the actual geometry to extract the appropriate probability from the larger state space ( either 5/9 or 25/41 ) .",
    "but this new perspective becomes quite mistaken if one further demands that the state of reality in the dotted box must _ be _ independent of the external geometry .",
    "it s obviously not true for this model , but given such an  independence fallacy \" one would be led to some interesting conclusions .",
    "namely , this all - possible - geometry state space would seem to be irreducible to a classical probability distribution over realistic microstates .    given the independence fallacy ,",
    "the argument would go like this : geometry 2a implies a 5/9 probability of similar circles , while geometry 2b implies a 25/41 probability .",
    "but since the state must be independent of the geometry , the question  are the two circles the same ? \" can not be assigned a coherent probability . and",
    "if it can not be answered , such a question should not even be asked .",
    "this , of course , is nonsense : such a question _ can _ be asked in this model , but the answer depends on the geometry .",
    "it is the independence fallacy which leads to a denial of an underlying reality  stemming from a motivation to describe a slice of a system independently from what lies outside .",
    "leaving aside the independence fallacy , it should be clear how the @xmath25 description of the dotted box should be updated upon learning new information .",
    "for example , if an agent learned that the geometry was in fact that of figure 2b , a properly - updated description would simply be a 25/41 probability that the two coins were the same . and upon learning the actual values of the coins ( say , @xmath21 ) , further updating would occur ; @xmath21 would then have a 100% probability .",
    "but the central point is that some information - updating naturally occurs when one learns the geometry of the model , even without any revealed circles . and",
    "because this is a realistic model ( with some real , underlying state ) , the information updating has no corresponding feature in the coin s objective reality .",
    "it is a subjective process , performed as some agent gains new information .",
    "the above model was presented as a static system in two spatial dimensions . the only place that time entered the analysis was in the updating process in the previous subsection , but this subjective updating had no relation to anything objective about the system .",
    "indeed , one could give different agents information in a different logical order , leading to different updating .",
    "both orders would be unrelated to any objective evolution of the system ; after all , the system is static .",
    "still , an objective time coordinate can be introduced in a trivial manner : simply redefine the model such that one of the spatial axes in figure 2 represents time instead of space .",
    "specifically , suppose that the vertical axis is time ( past on the bottom , future on the top ) .",
    "it is crucial not to introduce dynamics along with time ; one point of the model was to show how to analyze systems without dynamics . and",
    "since this analysis has already been performed , we do nt need to do it again .",
    "the dotted box now represents an instantaneous slice , and the same state - counting logic will lead to exactly the same probabilities as the purely spatial case .",
    "one might be tempted to propose reasons why this space - time model is fundamentally different from the original space - space model , perhaps assuming the existence of dynamical laws .",
    "such laws _ would _ break the analogy , but they are not part of the model . besides , the previous section is an existence proof that such a system _ can _ be analyzed in this manner , which is all that is needed for the below conclusions .",
    "it is logically possible to assign an equal probability to each temporally - extended microstate ( or more intuitively , `` microhistory '' ) and then make associated predictions .",
    "sure , it s an open question whether there is some _ other _ way to analyze systems without dynamics , or if this approach has any chance of actually making _ good _ predictions .",
    "but this approach _ is _ empirically successful for spatial systems without dynamics , and the early indications are that it looks promising for temporal systems as well @xcite",
    ".    one unusual feature of the original model should now be obvious .",
    "not knowing the spatial geometry ( say , 2a or 2b ) was an artificial restriction .",
    "but it s quite natural not to know the future , and once the vertical axis represents time , it s obvious why an agent might be uncertain whether the fourth circle would ever materialize .",
    "but this does not break the analogy between the spatial and temporal models .",
    "sure , we tend to learn about things in temporal order , but it s not a formal requirement ; we can film a movie of a system and watch it backwards , or even have spatial slices of a system delivered to us one at a time .",
    "the link between information - order and temporal - order is merely typical , not a logical necessity .    in this temporal context",
    ", it s also more understandable how one might fall into the independence fallacy .",
    "if we expect the future to be generated from the past via some dynamical laws , then we would also expect the probabilities we assign to the past to be independent of the future experimental geometry . but without dynamics , if we assign every microhistory an equal probability , the standard information - updating that made sense in the spatial case also makes sense in the temporal case .",
    "when we learn about the experimental geometry of the future , this all - at - once analysis typically updates our probabilistic assessment of the past .",
    "the modern arguments against an underlying reality for quantum systems typically involve hard - to - summarize `` no - go theorems '' , but the central issues do not require anything so difficult , and indeed were well known to the founders of quantum mechanics .",
    "a useful framework is the famous double slit experiment , which in richard feynman s words reveals the  central mystery \" of quantum theory .",
    "@xcite    in figure 3 , a source ( at the bottom ) creates a single photon that passes up through a pair of slits .",
    "the classical concept most closely related to photons are classical electromagnetic waves / fields , but photons behave in a way that disagrees with the dynamical maxwell equations which govern such fields .",
    "( a strike against dynamics . )",
    "namely , photons always seem to be measured in particle - like chunks , rather than spread out as classically predicted . for example , when a lens ( or two ) images the slits ( as in figure 3a ) , one always finds that the photon - wave went through one slit _ or _ the other .",
    "and yet it appears that photons _ do _ spread out , at least between measurements , if one considers the experiment in figure 3b . here",
    "a screen records the interference pattern produced by waves passing through _ both _ slits , built up one photon at a time . in the many - photon limit , this pattern is predicted by classical dynamics _ only _ if the waves pass through both slits and interfere .",
    "since each individual photon conforms to this pattern ( not landing in dark fringes ) , it seems evident that each photon also passes through both slits .    where reality seems to fail here is the description of the photon at the slits ",
    "one slice of the full spacetime diagram . in 3a",
    "the photon seems to go through only one slit ; in 3b it seems to go through both . and",
    "since the status of the photon at the slits is `` obviously '' independent of the future experimental geometry , it follows that the actual location(s ) of the photon - wave at the slits can not be assigned a coherent probability .    except that this is _ exactly _ the independence fallacy ! compare figure 2 ( temporal version ) to figure 3 ; they are quite analogous . in 2a and 3a the right and left branches stay separate ; in 2b and 3b the geometry begins in the same way , but then allows recombination . following the above logic , _ avoiding _ the independence fallacy allows a coherent underlying reality for the double - slit experiment .",
    "the answer is something like [ if 3a then 50%(left),50%(right ) ; if 3b then 100%(both ) ] .",
    "upon learning the future geometry , an agent would update her assessment of the past probabilities , just as before .",
    "once this updating occurs , a classical reality is revealed .",
    "( for 3b , it is perfectly realistic to have a wave go through both slits . )",
    "it only looks strange if you _",
    "do nt _ analyze it all - at - once , or attempt to map this process onto a story with dynamical evolution .",
    "unlike other resolutions of the double - slit experiment , _ this _ resolution naturally resolves more problematic situations .",
    "the no - go theorems against realistic models all use the independence fallacy in one form or another .",
    "the typical assumption is that it s always fair to describe spatial slices independently from the future experimental geometry .",
    "but if one updates past probabilities upon learning which measurement a system will encounter , the premises behind these theorems are explicitly violated .",
    "even so , this complicated updating of probabilities on different time - slices is not the most natural picture .",
    "relativity tells us that the slicing is subjective ; the objective structure lies in the 4d spacetime block .",
    "it is here where the microhistories reside , and to be realistic , one of these microhistories must _ really be there_. a physics experiment is then about _ learning _ which microhistory actually occurs , via information - based updating ; we gain relevant information upon preparation , measurement setting , and measurement itself . and the best way to coherently describe this updating is with an all - at - once analysis .",
    "if there is a plausible reality underlying quantum theory , the `` it from bit '' idea looks wrongheaded .",
    "the microhistory - reality proposed here demands that one gives up the intuitive universe - as - computer story of dynamical time evolution , so one may still choose to cling to dynamics , voiding this analysis .",
    "but in the process , one is also rejecting a spacetime - based reality .",
    "is this a fair trade - off ? is dynamics really so crucial that it s worth delving into some nebulous `` informational immaterialism '' @xcite or elevating configuration space into some weird reality in its own right ? and",
    "why should dynamical laws be so important if one is giving up on a fundamental reality in the first place ?",
    "after all , there are excellent reasons for dropping dynamics , the quantum no - go theorems being prime examples",
    ". we also have the beautiful path integral where _ all _ possible histories must be considered ( whether they obey dynamical laws or not ; see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . and is it really so crucial that we live in a universe where nothing interesting happens in the time - direction , where everything about the present was encoded in some initial cosmic wavefunction ?",
    "it s not such a stretch to view our world as one _ possibility _ of infinitely many , unshackled from strict predeterministic rules .    after giving up on reality via the independence fallacy",
    ", the standard quantum story ironically responds by making almost everything _ interdependent _ in some strange configuration space .",
    "( almost everything , just not the future or the past . ) the simpler alternative proposed here is simply to link everything together in standard 4d spacetime .",
    "this casts our information in the classical form : @xmath10 $ ] , with the crucial caveat that the @xmath12 s are now micro__histories _ _ , spanning 4d instead of 3d .",
    "so long as one does not additionally impose dynamical laws , there is no theorem that one of these microhistories can not be real .    still , qualitative arguments are one thing ; the analogy between the above model and the double slit experiment can only be pushed so far .",
    "and one can go _ too _ far in the no - dynamics direction : considering _ all _ histories , as in the path integral , would lead to the conclusion that the future would be almost completely uncorrelated with the past , contradicting macroscopic observations .",
    "but this approach can be made much more quantitative .",
    "the key is to only consider a large natural subset of possible histories , such that classical dynamics is usually recovered as a general guideline in the many - particle limit .",
    "better yet , for at least one model , the structure of quantum probabilities naturally emerges . and as with any deeper - level theory that purports to explain higher - level behavior , intriguing new predictions are also indicated .",
    "@xcite    even if the arguments presented in this essay are not a convincing reason to discard fundamental dynamical equations , they nevertheless serve as a strong rebuttal to the `` it from bit '' proponents . whether or not one _ wants _ to give up dynamics , the point is that one _ can _ give up dynamics , in which case quantum information can plausibly be _ about something real_. instead of winning the argument by default , then , `` it from bit '' proponents now need to argue that it s _ better _ to give up reality .",

    "( specifically , listing the states of the three circles and the two links , the 4 possible  hh \" microstates are hbhbh , hbhgh , hghbh , and hghgh . ) according to the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics , an hh will be four times as likely as a tt , for which only red links are possible ( trhrt ) . the full table for figure 2a is :"
