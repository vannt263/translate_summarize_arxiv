    "during their asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stage , intermediate mass stars undergo substantial mass loss triggered by pulsation shocks and radiation pressure ( e.g. , willson @xcite ; van winckel @xcite ) .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy is one of the recognized tools to study the mass loss process ( e.g. , kleinmann & hall @xcite ; volk , kwok & hrivnak @xcite ; lancon & wood @xcite ; bieging , rieke & rieke @xcite ; winters et al .",
    "the near - infrared jhk bands , contain several important diagnostic lines that can be used as signatures to probe the atmospheres of these stars ( hinkle , hall & ridgway @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most dramatic manifestations of the agb stage is the high rate of mass loss that is mainly attributed to pulsational levitation of atmosphere followed by expulsion of matter by the radiation pressure ( wood @xcite ; bowen @xcite ; gail & sedlmayr @xcite ; vassiliadis & wood @xcite ; habing @xcite ; feast @xcite ; winters et al .",
    "@xcite ; willson @xcite ; woitke @xcite ; garcia - lario @xcite ) .",
    "one of the issues that we would address is the possible signatures of pulsational mass loss in the spectra of agb stars .",
    "we would also like to study the infrared spectral signatures that the intermediate mass stars leave while evolving beyond agb stage to become planetary nebulae ( e.g. , kwok @xcite )    in this work we report near - infrared ( h and k bands ) spectroscopy on a selection of about 80 agb stars of different types , namely m type , s type , semi - regular variables ( sr ) and post - agb ( pagb ) candidates ( section 2 ) . in section 3.1 , we try to seek significant differences among these types and correlate spectral signature strengths with pulsation parameters or mass loss indicators ( such as the infrared color indices ) in case of m and s and sr types .",
    "further , we present the spitzer archival spectra in the mid - infrared region on a few post - agb stars in order to find out the evolutionary stage of these stars in terms of the spectral features seen in the spectra ( section 3.2 ) . following this , using the dusty code , we model the infrared spectral energy distributions of these sample stars , constructed from archival data in the visible , near and far - infrared regions to investigate basic differences in the photospheric and circumstellar parameters among the various types of agb stars ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "some interesting aspects on variation of spectral lines in a few pagb stars are discussed in section 4 .",

    "the observations were made at a spectral resolution of @xmath0 1000 .",
    "spectrophotometric standard stars of a0v type were used for each programme star at similar air mass to remove the telluric absorptions and for relative flux calibration ( cf .",
    "lancon & rocca - volmerange @xcite ) . for sky background subtraction ,",
    "two traces were taken for each star for each cycle of integration at two spatially separated positions along the slit within 30 arcsec .",
    "typical overall integration times varied between 0.6 to 160 sec for the brightest and faintest stars in our sample ( in each of the three bands ) .",
    "the atmospheric oh vibration - rotation lines were used to calibrate wavelength .",
    "the hi absorption lines from the standard star spectra are removed by interpolation .",
    "the resulting spectra of the standard star were used for the removal of telluric lines from the program star by ratioing .",
    "the ratioed spectra were then multiplied by a blackbody spectrum at the effective temperature corresponding to the standard star to obtain the final spectra .",
    "typically the s / n ratios at the strongest and the weakest spectral features varied between 100 and 3 respectively . data processing was done using standard spectroscopic tasks ( e.g. , apall ) inside iraf .",
    "the programme stars were selected from published literature / catalogues ( fouque et al .",

    "@xcite , wang & chen @xcite , and stasinska et al .",
    "our sample contains about 80 stars with the selection based on the observability at mt .",
    "abu during the period november - may and jhk band magnitudes brighter than 8 - 9 . among these stars ,",
    "30 are m type ; 17 s type ; 15 sr type and 16 are pagb stars ( some of which are known to be transition / proto - pne , see ueta et al",
    ". @xcite and kelly & hrivnak @xcite )",
    ". the greater bias towards m types in the sample is due to the fact that they are brighter in k band than the others .",
    "tables 1 - 4 list all the stars in the four categories along with the [ h - k ] and [ k-12 ] colors computed from 2mass and iras photometric archival data .",
    "the phases ( @xmath1 ) of the variable stars of m and sr types , corresponding to the dates of our observations , are also listed in the tables ( epochs taken from kholopov et al .",
    "the spectral types are taken from simbad data base .",
    "fig 1 shows some typical spectra for different types considered here . in general , we find in the agb stars , the photospheric absorption lines of na i doublet at 2.21 @xmath2 m , ca i triplet at @xmath0 2.26 @xmath2 m , as well as mg i at 1.708 @xmath2 m in all the sample stars .",
    "brackett series lines of hi were found mostly among the pagb stars where a hotter central source is believed to be present . in addition , the co vibration - rotation lines of first and second overtone bands ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively ) were seen in a large number of m , s and sr type stars and in a few pagb stars .",
    "some pagb stars showed hi brackett emission lines ( iras 06556 + 1623 , 17423 - 1755 , 18237 - 0715 and 19399 + 2312 for the last one of which our spectra are new ) and an indication of fainter emission in co. this could be due to the fact that as the central star hots up , the co lines become progressively weaker and finally disappear when co dissociates ( at 11.2 ev ) . around this time the hi recombination lines start becoming prominent in emission .",
    "our spectra on iras 06556 + 1623 and 17423 - 1755 are quite comparable to those of garcia - hernandez et al .",

    "our spectra showed for the first time absorption in hi lines and co bands .",
    "some of the pagb objects that showed variability are discussed in section 4 .",
    "equivalent widths ( ews ) were computed for all the spectral features that are detected in our sample stars .",
    "the errors in the equivalent widths are mainly from the s / n ratio of the lines . to that extent",
    "the errors are estimated to be about 3  , mostly applicable to the low s / n ( @xmath0 3 ) line detections , such as the metallic lines ; but for high s / n ( @xmath6 5 ) line / bands the errors are @xmath7 1  . tables 1 - 4 list the ews ( in  , positive for absorption and negative for emission ) of the co(3 - 0 , 4 - 1 ) second overtone bands in h band , co(2 - 0 , 3 - 1 ) first overtone bands in k band , and hi brackett series lines ( only for pagb stars ) , for the programme stars of each category .",
    "based on physical processes , very interesting correlations were found among spectral features observed in agb stars ( kleinmann & hall @xcite ; lancon & wood @xcite ; bieging , rieke & rieke @xcite ) . we tried to see if our sample too shows these .",
    "kleinmann & hall @xcite and bieging , rieke & rieke @xcite have found that the co(2 - 0 ) and co(3 - 1 ) band head strengths are correlated . from the tables 1 - 3",
    ", we can see this trend ; in addition , one can see a correlation between co(3 - 0 ) & co(4 - 1 ) bands as well .",
    "the first overtone bands of co ( @xmath3 ) in the k band arise at t @xmath0 800 k partly in the photosphere and partly in the circumstellar envelopes ; while the second overtone bands ( @xmath4 ) in the h band arise at t @xmath0 3000 - 4000 k entirely in the photospheric layers ( e.g. , hinkle , hall & ridgway @xcite ; emerson @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the pulsational effects may be more pronounced in the @xmath4 bands than in the @xmath3 bands ; while the former will reflect the circumstellar matter properties better .",
    "thus we would expect a better correlation between ew of @xmath4 bands with pulsation period p than the @xmath3 bands .",
    "it should be noted here that for the co bands the s /",
    "n ratio is high(in many cases @xmath6 5 ) and hence the errors in ew are @xmath7 1  . fig 2 shows equivalent widths of co(3 - 0 ) and co(2 - 0 ) plotted against the color [ h - k ] for m type stars",
    ". the phases of these variable stars are not necessarily the same between our observations and 2mass or iras data acquisition ( see tables 1 for phases during our observations ) . also shown in fig 2",
    "are the ews of the co lines from the s type stars ( against the color [ k-12 ] ) .",
    "the trend of correlation for co(3 - 0 ) band is quite clear . for sr stars",
    ", we did not find any such trend .    in order to quantify the degree of correlation between two parameters , we have used the spearman s rank correlation method that does not assume any functional relationship between them ( e.g. , used by loidl , lancon & jorgensen @xcite ) .",
    "fig 2 shows only those correlations with co(3 - 0 ) for which the rank coefficient ( @xmath8 ) @xmath6 0.50 and its significance ( @xmath9 ) @xmath7 0.01 ( i.e. , a chance occurrence of 1 in 100 ) .",
    "we find that for m stars , for the co(3 - 0 ) vs [ h - k ] , @xmath8 ) is 0.50 with @xmath9 of 0.008 ( a chance occurrence of 8 in 1000 ) ; while for s stars , for co(3 - 0 ) vs [ k-12 ] @xmath8 is 0.74 with @xmath9 of 0.003 .",
    "these are moderately significant correlations as may also be visually seen from the plots . in comparison ,",
    "the coefficients and their significance are quite poor for the co(2 - 0 ) plots in fig 2 . for m stars",
    ", one can also see a trend in the co ( @xmath4 ) vs log p better than co(@xmath3 ) vs log p(not shown ) .",
    "usually the mass loss is correlated well with the pulsation period ; as also by the color indices [",
    "h - k ] and [ k-12](whitelock et al .",
    "while the trends in fig 2 are certainly beyond the errors in ew , we find that the scatter is rather significant in the correlation plot between the co(3 - 0 ) band ews and [ h - k ] and other mass loss indicators ( not shown ) such as log p and [ k-12 ] , although it is much less in comparison to the plots for co(2 - 0 ) band ( only [ h - k ] is shown ) .",
    "lancon & wood @xcite and loidl , lancon & jorgensen @xcite argued that in the case of carbon - rich agb stars , the co lines arise deeper in side the atmospheres ( close to the photospheres ) and hence may not respond to dynamical effects such as pulsations as much as those lines that arise in the outer atmospheres . in our sample m stars ,",
    "a large number of them are oxygen - rich and hence the pulsational phase effects may be significant and can possibly account for the scatter in our plots .",
    "we have searched the spitzer archival spectroscopic data in the mid - infrared region of 6 - 30 @xmath2 m and succeeded in obtaining 7 pagb stars for which the data were available and unpublished and are not in the list of sources presented originally by hrivnak , volk & kwok @xcite .",
    "the raw spectra ( post bcd data ) were analyzed using the spitzer irs custom extraction ( spice ) task under spitzer data processing softwares .",
    "interesting spectra in the wavelength range of 10 - 18 @xmath2 m from these objects are shown in fig 3 ( where in addition to the 7 spitzer stars , we have shown one more pagb star , namely iras 22272 + 5435 , re - analysed from the iso spectral archives ) .",
    "of these 8 stars , iras 19157 - 0247 and iras 22327 - 1731 are of early spectral types and showed nearly featureless continua ( see fig 3 ) .",
    "for the spectra of those stars that showed the in - plane and out - of - plane bending modes of c - h bonds in pah molecules ( e.g. , kwok @xcite and tielens @xcite ) , we have subtracted the continuum by ( fifth order ) polynomial fitting in segments , in order to bring out the comparative strengths of the features .",
    "fig 4 shows the 6 - 10 @xmath2 m spectra on two stars for which the data are available ; these stars show the c - c stretching modes of 6.2 and 6.9 @xmath2 m and the blended features around 8 @xmath2 m due to c - c stretching and c - h in - plane bending modes .",
    "a comparison of the spectra in the region of 10 - 18 @xmath2 m common to about 6 pagb objects suggests that the intensity of the spectral features due to pah molecules depends on the spectral type of the star - being weakest or shallowest for cooler stars than for relatively hotter stars .",
    "this can possibly be due to the uv radiation flux and the hardness that is available to excite the molecules ( tielens @xcite ) .",
    "we have computed the ratio of the ews of the f@xmath10/f@xmath11 feature which is known to indicate whether the molecule is neutral or ionized ( see tielens @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the pagb star iras 04296 + 3429 , having a ratio of 11.3 , probably shows indications for ionized pah molecules , while in iras 22272 + 5435 , with a ratio of 0.8 , neutrals may be predominant ( see figs 3 and 4 ) . further",
    ", the relative structure of pahs may be inferred from the ratio of f@xmath11/f@xmath12 : a large ratio indicates large compact pahs , while a small ratio results when these molecules break up into smaller irregular structures ( hony et al .",
    "@xcite ; sloan et al .",
    "@xcite ; peeters et al .",
    "@xcite ; tielens @xcite ) . in our sample pagb stars ,",
    "we find ( see fig 3 ) that the objects iras 07134 + 1005 and 23304 + 5147 have ratios of 4.7 and 3.6 respectively and hence may have large compact pah molecules compared to iras 04296 + 3429 that has a ratio of 0.8 . in iras 05113 + 1347 and 22272 + 5435 the spitzer spectra show wide features at 7 - 8 and 11 - 12 @xmath2 m regions .",
    "such broad features are usually attributed to more complex structures in pah molecules ( see kwok @xcite ) .",
    "since the pah modes arise by absorption of uv photons , their presence indicates the onset of substantial uv flux from the central star and hence the onset of transition / proto - pn phase .",
    "abu spectra taken on all these objects do not show the hi brackett series in emission ; they are seen in absorption .",
    "thus it is possible that the uv radiation is soft ( @xmath13 13.6 ev ) as h ionization has not yet started in these objects .",
    "only three of our sample pagb stars have spitzer archival data beyond 18 @xmath2 m , and all showed the 21 @xmath2 m feature ( kwok , volk & hrivnak @xcite ; volk , kwok & hrivnak @xcite and decin et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which was attributed to tic ( von helden et al .",
    "@xcite ) or sic ( speck & hofmeister @xcite ) . since these objects are already known to have the 21 @xmath2 m feature ( volk , kwok & hrivnak @xcite ) , in table 4 we give only the ews of the feature ( in @xmath2 m ) , along with the ew for iras 07134 + 1005 computed from iso archival data .",
    "all the properties of the observed feature ( the peak wavelength , width and red - side asymmetry ) resemble the sic feature as shown by speck & hofmeister @xcite ) .      using the dusty code ( ivezic & elitzur @xcite )",
    ", we have modeled the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) in the spectral region of 0.5 - 100 @xmath2 m .",
    "this code incorporates full dynamical calculation for radiatively driven winds in agb stars .",
    "the photometric data on all the programme objects were compiled mainly from 2mass and iras archives .",
    "we have modelled the seds of all the programme stars except those that have upper - limits ( quality = 1 ) in iras data in more than one band . for a majority of the programme stars iras lrs data",
    "are not available . even in the iso archives",
    "we could get only a few stars .",
    "therefore , we have modelled only the photometric fluxes , assuming silicate dust for m , s and sr types ; while for most of the pagb stars , we required carbonaceous dust .",
    "the dust grain data were taken from in - built tables in dusty . in a few cases we obtained data from denis and msx archives as well . in the model that assumes spherical geometry , we fix stellar parameters like the photometric temperature ( based on the visible and the near - ir data ) , inner dust shell temperature , type of dust and size distribution ( mrn assumed ) and opacity at 0.5 @xmath2 m ( usually taken value between 0.1 and 1.0 ) .",
    "we have used density distribution relevant for modelling the radiatively driven winds in agb stars as incorporated in to dusty by its authors .",
    "there would be 10 - 20 % uncertainties in all the model output parameters .",
    "we have generated nearly 150 models using several combinations of the above parameters .",
    "we then take the fluxes computed by the code and normalize with the observed 2 @xmath2 m flux from each object and construct the model seds . a @xmath14 test",
    "is performed to select the best fit model . in general",
    "the model shows that the m types have lower effective temperatures than the s and sr types .",
    "m types show higher opacities by a factor of 2 , than the s and sr types ; s type being lowest .",
    "however the inner dust shell temperature for all the types were found to be in the range 450 - 700 k. the seds of pagb stars showed , in general , double - humped but flatter trend than their agb counterparts , indicating detached circumstellar shells ( see e.g. , hrivnak & kwok @xcite ) .",
    "since some of these are transition objects their spectral classes are much earlier than m types .",
    "the inner dust shell temperatures for most of the pagb stars , as listed in table 4 , are found to be in the range of @xmath0 100 - 300 k , significantly cooler than the values for agb stars .",
    "a warmer dust shell was required in addition to the cooler one in one of the pagb stars ( 1200 k for iras 06556 + 1623 ) .",
    "the dust parameters that we obtained are in good agreement with those in the published literature . a few examples of seds of m , s , sr and pagb stars and their model fits are shown in figs 5 - 7 , respectively .",
    "the dusty agb star model estimates mass loss rate also but with larger uncertainty of 30 % .",
    "the mass loss rates ( in m@xmath15/yr ) thus obtained are listed in tables 1 - 4 for all the types ; the sign @xmath16 shows stars for which the rates are independently available from co rotational line observations by several authors , namely , loup , forveille & omont @xcite , sahai & liechti @xcite , groenewegen & de jong @xcite , jorissen & knapp @xcite , winters et al .",

    "@xcite , hoogzaad et al .",
    "@xcite and hrivnak & bieging @xcite for pagb stars .",
    "our model mass loss rates are in reasonably good agreement with those determined from co rotational lines , for all cases . from tables 1 and 4 ,",
    "one can see a clear trend of increase of mass loss rate with increase of the color [ k-12 ] ( e.g. , bieging , rieke & rieke @xcite ) .",
    "* basically most of our sample m type stars are in the ascending phase of their agb stage and hence the mass loss rate increases with the [ k-12 ] index ( see whitelock et al . @xcite and habing @xcite ) ; while the pagb stars in our sample are already in the ppn stage , having just passed the superwind mass loss event . following this phase the mass loss would decrease .",
    "in fact one can see ( table 4 ) that the mass loss rates for hot pagb stars are distinctly less than those for cooler ones , possibly indicating the decrease of mass loss after a superwind event . *",
    "most of the pagb stars in our sample are identified as proto - pne ( see ueta et al . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "repeated spectroscopic observations were made on a few selected stars iras 17423 - 1755 , iras 18237 - 0715 , iras 19399 + 2312 and iras 22272 + 5435 ( see table 4 for their spectral types ) .",

    "interestingly the h band second overtone bands of co were _ still present _ in the spectra on 22 dec .",
