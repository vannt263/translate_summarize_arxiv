    "dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) are low mass , but gas rich galaxies and are found rather isolated and spread throughout the local group . all dirrs display low elemental abundances indicating that only little chemical evolution has taken place over the past 15gyr despite ongoing star formation .",
    "the lack of strong starburst cycles in these isolated objects may be because of little or no merger interaction .",
    "therefore , in the context the cold dark matter scenarios of hierarchical galaxy formation by merger of smaller structures @xcite , dwarf galaxies and in particular the isolated dwarf irregular galaxies could be the purest remnants of the proto - galactic fragments from the early universe .",
    "hence , the dirrs are also one of the possible sources for the damped ly@xmath2 absorption ( dla ) systems as observed in quasar spectra over a large range of redshifts ; see  e.g.  @xcite for a recent compilation of dla metallicities over @xmath7 .",
    "the dirrs being possible remnants of the early universe might allow us to study early galaxy evolution in great detail in the nearby universe , even in the local group .",
    "in particular the early chemical evolution of galaxies is of interest here to shed light on the formation of the first generations of stars . the most powerful way to study",
    "the chemical evolution of a galaxy is via the elemental abundances and abundance ratios of their stellar and gas content which contain a record of the star formation histories ( sfh ) of the galaxy over the last 15gyr .",
    "the analysis of bright nebular emission lines of regions has been the most frequent approach to modeling chemical evolution of more distant galaxies to date @xcite .",
    "so far , only a very limited number of elements can be examined and quantified when using this approach .",
    "the chemical evolution of a galaxy depends on the contributions of all its constituents , e.g. , sne type ia and ii , high mass stars , thermal pulsing in low and intermediate mass agb stars .",
    "thus , more elements than just those observed in nebulae need to be measured , since each have different formation sites which sample different constituents .",
    "the @xmath2 elements like oxygen are created primarily in short - lived massive stars , while the iron - group elements are produced in sne of both high and low mass stars .",
    "therefore , it is expected that substantially different sfhs of individual galaxies shall be represented in different present - day @xmath5 ratios as discussed e.g. in @xcite . in reverse , the accurate measurement of the absolute stellar abundances and abundance ratios allows to put constraints on the sfh of the respective galaxy .",
    "in addition to the study of the average metallicities of a galaxy as discussed above , also the spatial distribution of abundances and abundance patterns within a galaxy contains important information about the redistribution processes of the newly produced elements and their subsequent mixing with the ism .",
    "if the abundances of a number of stars distributed over the galaxy can be analyzed , possible chemical inhomogeneities e.g.  in form of large spreads in the abundances or abundance gradients can be studied and provide additional constraints of the chemo - dynamical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , most dirr systems are too distant for the detailed study and abundance analyses of e.g.  their red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , which are of great importance due to their large spread in age . hence",
    ", to date few details on the chemical evolution of the dirr galaxies have been available . in the case of the dirr sextansa studied in this work the tip of the rgb",
    "is found at visual magnitudes of @xmath8 @xcite  far beyond the capabilities of even the most efficient high - resolution spectrographs on today s 8 to 10-meter class telescopes .",
    "however , with the same class of latest telescopes and instrumentation , the visually brightest stars of the dirr galaxies , i.e. , the blue supergiants ( @xmath9 in sextansa ) become now accessible to detailed spectroscopy , which allow us to determine the present - day abundances of @xmath2 _ and _ iron group elements .",
    "the abundances of the @xmath2 elements derived from the rich spectra of hot massive stars can be directly compared and tied to the nebular @xmath2 element abundances because both nebulae and massive stars have comparable ages and the same formation sites .",
    "the first abundance studies based on high - resolution spectra of a - type supergiant stars were carried out for the nearby local group dirrs ngc6822 and wlm @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 element and iron group abundances could be derived for two stars in both dirr galaxies . for ngc6822 and wlm the [ @xmath5 ]",
    "ratios are in good agreement with the _ solar _ ratio .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising since both galaxies have ongoing star formation and different star formation histories as determined from their stellar populations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    the isolated dwarf irregular galaxy sextansa (= ddo75 ) with its distance of about @xmath11mpc @xcite",
    "is located at a similar distance as sextansb , ngc3109 , and the antlia dwarf galaxies which form a small group of galaxies at the edge of the local group  possibly not even bound to the local group which would make sextansa a member of the nearest ( sub)cluster of galaxies @xcite . the present - day chemical composition was studied from the emission - line spectroscopy of bright compact regions @xcite .",

    "the agreement of the and abundances and hence the ionization equilibrium is achieved if the respective nlte corrections are applied , i.e. , @xmath66dex for sexa-754 , @xmath67dex for sexa-1344 , and @xmath68dex for sexa-1911 . as discussed before ,",

    "the mean metallicity of the three stars are so found to be @xmath0\\right>=-0.99\\pm0.04\\pm{\\it 0.06}$ ] which  to our knowledge  makes these three stars the to date most metal - poor massive stars in any galaxy for which a detailed abundance analysis has been carried out .",
    "titanium and scandium can be considered as either @xmath2 or iron - group elements .",
    "the ti abundances were derived from a large number of lines of the dominant ionization stage of singly ionized titanium and are in good agreement with iron , i.e. , @xmath95\\right>=0.08\\pm0.05\\pm{\\it 0.08}$ ] while sc shows a slight underabundance of @xmath96\\right>=-0.20\\pm0.03\\pm{\\it 0.09}$ ] .",

    "it should be noted here , that the pristine nebular and stellar abundances of some elements can be altered by effects of dust depletion and rotational mixing which complicates a quantitative comparison of nebular and stellar abundances @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of the stars and nebulae studied in sextansa , the good agreement within the estimated errors suggest that the contributions due to these effects to the determined abundances are small .",

    "these are significant differences that are currently not understood and may suggest that wlm is the first galaxy to display inhomogeneous mixing .",

    "the same level of abundance homogeneity is found for the iron - group elements in the stars .",
    "the high level of homogeneity of nebular abundances in dwarf irregular galaxies has been discussed as possible evidence against in situ ( `` on the spot '' ) enrichment by @xcite and therefore against the general validity of the instantaneous recycling approximation as typically used in chemical evolution models . @xcite",

    "recent chandra spectroscopy results for ngc1569 by @xcite favor the hot phase as the reservoir for newly synthesized and expelled gas .",
    "the @xmath5 abundance ratio is a key constraint for the chemical evolution of a galaxy .",
    "@xmath2 elements are primarily synthesized in sneii while the iron - group elements are mainly produced in sneia but also in sneii .",
    "a star formation burst in a galaxy will temporarily increase the @xmath5 ratio of the ism due to the massive stars that quickly enrich the ism with @xmath2 elements , while the lower mass stars will then slowly increase the content of iron - group elements resulting in a slow decline of the @xmath5 ratio of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the expected differences in the @xmath5 ratios for galaxies with different star formation histories , and in particular noted that the solar @xmath5 ratio must not be regarded as an universal ratio .    from the three stars in sextansa",
    ", the @xmath5 ratio is measured as @xmath106\\right>=-0.11\\pm0.02\\pm{\\it 0.10}$ ] .",
    "this @xmath2/fe ratio is much lower than in galactic stars of similar metallicity @xcite . at the metallicity of these sextansa stars , [ fe / h ] @xmath107 ,",
    "the galactic thick disk and galactic halo stars overlap with a [ @xmath2/fe ] @xmath108 + 0.3 .",
    "the lower @xmath2/fe ratios in these sextansa stars further follows the trend found from the abundance analyses of stars in two other dirrs , ngc6822 and wlm @xcite , but extends the metallicity range now sampled from @xmath109=-0.5 $ ] in those galaxies to @xmath109=-1.0 $ ] . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", this lower metallicity now overlaps the upper metallicities sampled by red giant stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies , which also show much lower @xmath2/fe ratios than galactic metal - poor stars @xcite . in the dwarf",
    "spheroidal galaxies , the low [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios near [ fe / h ] = @xmath110 are most likely due to the lower star formation rates , thus slower chemical evolution .",
    "the metallicity range of the dwarf irregular galaxies also overlaps with the damped ly@xmath2 absorption systems @xcite , which are also recognized to have low @xmath2/fe ratios .",
    "this might suggest that low @xmath2/fe ratios are a generic effect at low metallicities .",
    "the star formation histories for sextansa , wlm , and ngc6822 are globally similar as derived from their cmds .",
    "a comparison can be seen in fig .",
    "8 of @xcite .",
    "accordingly , all three dirrs had significant star formation at ancient times , @xmath111gyr ago , with a hiatus at intermediate ages , @xmath112gyr ago , and recent star formation events in the past 1gyr .",
    "@xcite has recently emphasized that the sfh of a galaxy affects the _ absolute _ elemental abundances , but is only of minor importance for the abundance",
    "_ ratios _ , the latter being primarily determined by the stellar lifetimes , initial mass functions ( imf ) and the stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "thus , the impact of different sfhs on the @xmath5 ratio is related to the star formation efficiency , and manifests itself as a short plateau in the @xmath113 $ ] ratio at low metallicities in galaxies with low star formation rates , like irregulars ( either in bursts or continuous ) , while the plateau is maintained to higher metallicities for systems with high star formation rates like bulges and ellipticals .",
    "thus , our finding that the [ @xmath5 ] ratios in three dirrs with similar sfhs is significantly lower than in the metal - poor galactic stars can be explained in this scenario .",
    "the three dirrs with a metallicity range from @xmath114<-0.4 $ ] have already left the @xmath113 $ ] plateau and presently display the same lower @xmath113 $ ] ratio .",
    "that this ratio is similar to solar suggests that the integrated stellar yields from a star formation event is consistent with the solar abundance ratios , probably due to the _ universal _ nature of stellar lifetimes , imfs , and stellar nucleosynthesis . that the high - redshift dla absortion systems also show low [ @xmath2/fe ]",
    "ratios suggests that they are also systems with low star formation rates , but this could be either irregular galaxies or the outer parts of spirals .",
    "a recent study of published dla system abundances in comparison with chemical evolution models of different galaxy morphologies by @xcite has identified the irregular and spiral galaxies as the possibly ideal sites to create the dla systems , while ellipticals can be ruled out .",
    "the value of high resolution spectroscopy of the brightest blue stars in nearby galaxies for detailed , quantitative abundance studies has been further demonstrated in this work . to gain further insight into the chemical evolution of the dwarf galaxies and",
    "hence into the early evolution of galaxies with low star formation rates , requires more detailed abundance analyses of their stars , particularly towards the lower metallicities .",
