    "we apply similiar techniques to the linearisation of ( [ eqn : tw.diff ] ) and sketch how the local uniqueness of solitary high - energy waves can be established by an implicit function argument . in the final section [ sect : dis ] , we set the results into the wider context of stable coherent motion for fpu lattices .",
