    "<S> , the @xmath3 magnetic field angle for which the rate is minimal does depend on the ratio of rashba and dresselhaus coefficients ( through @xmath67 ) , and on the anistropy axis of the dot ( through @xmath56 ) : @xmath72 to illustrate further the dependence of the relaxation rate on the orientation of the in - plane field and the dot major axis , we plot the prediction of eq .   in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the unexpectedly high value of @xmath79 comes from the large value of the relaxation rate at its minimum . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that this minimum value may also be dominated by other relaxation mechanisms that do not depend on @xmath26 , such as the interaction with nuclear spins @xcite , or the contribution from the random part of the r so coupling @xcite which arises due to fluctuations in the dopant concentration in the @xmath56-doping layer . </S>",
    "<S> contributions of orbital excitations along the minor axis also lead to a finite offset , as is suggested by eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> without knowing more about the dot confinement shape , we did not find it reasonable to try to separate these possible contributions by introducing more fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we relabel @xmath87 , reinterpreting it as an effective angle accounting for all these possibilities together .    using the value of @xmath88 obtained from the fit and eqs .   and , we can also perform a fit of the same data set with @xmath67 and @xmath68 as free parameters , as a function of @xmath56 . </S>",

    "<S> from there we conclude that without knowing the value of @xmath56 , we can not establish the relative strength of the r and d couplings , as all values of @xmath56 are possible , in principle . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can infer that , most probably , in our sample @xmath14 and @xmath9 were of comparable magnitude and opposite sign [ @xmath89 , as these choices cover the larger portion of ( a priori equally probable ) values of @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> there are two points , @xmath76 and @xmath40 , where the rate @xmath68 diverges ( see supplemental material @xcite , sec .  </S>",
    "<S> iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that such values of @xmath56 can not be reconciled with our data . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as follows from eq .  , </S>",
    "<S> for these values @xmath78 does not depend on the so couplings , and should be @xmath90 or @xmath40 , different from what we measured . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore note that if @xmath56 were known , @xmath91 could be extracted directly . in order to also determine the absolute values of @xmath14 and @xmath9 , </S>",
    "<S> more information is needed , such as the energy level spectrum of the dot .    for future experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we give guidance for the optimal orientation of the quantum dot gate pattern and magnetic field relative to the crystal axes . </S>",
    "<S> first , since spin relaxation and edsr based spin manipulation are governed by the same matrix elements for spin transitions , it is possible to simultaneously optimize for fast edsr driven rabi oscillations and for fast relaxation ( useful for qubit reset @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , slow relaxation ( useful for high - fidelity read - out @xcite ) can not be optimized together with fast edsr , as long as the phonon coupling is isotropic , as then both the spin relaxation rate and the edsr rate scale with the same factor . in circular dots , </S>",
    "<S> this factor is given in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the r and d terms maximally enhance or cancel each other when the external magnetic field is oriented along the @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath2 $ ] crystallographic axes , as can be expected also from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> complete cancellation of the two contributions is possible only when @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> when r and d have very different strengths , @xmath38 does not vary with the magnetic field orientation . for anisotropic dots , </S>",
    "<S> the factor is given in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath38 oscillates with the field orientation and can reach zero ( for @xmath53 ) regardless of the ratio of @xmath14 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for maximizing the edsr amplitude , in circular dots the external magnetic field has to point along @xmath1 $ ] ( @xmath2 $ ] ) , if @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , and the driving electric field should be parallel to @xmath95 . in elongated dots </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field should be oriented along the in - plane angle @xmath96 , and the driving electric field should be along the dot soft axis . if the direction of the main dot axis can be chosen , it should point along @xmath1 $ ] ( @xmath2 $ ] ) , if @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .    in conclusion , we show that the in - plane orientation of the magnetic field can strongly impact the spin relaxation time in quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a variation in @xmath0 by more than an order of magnitude when rotating the field in the 2deg plane . </S>",
    "<S> we can take advantage of this dependence in future experiments to either maximize or minimize @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the dependence of @xmath0 on magnetic field angle provides a sensitive probe of the ratio of the r and d so contributions , which can be used even when so induced avoided level crossings are too small to be measured @xcite , which is the case of gaas . </S>",
    "<S> what is needed is either a symmetric qd confining potential or , for an elliptical dot , a good estimate of the magnitude and direction of the qd anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> similar considerations are also valid for singlet - triplet qubits </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and a polarized triplet ( 1,1 ) in a biased two electron double dot tuned close to a singlet(1,1)-singlet(0,2 ) anti - crossing have the same angular dependence as the single electron matrix elements discussed here . ] , where the easy axis is given by the double dot dipole axis @xcite . </S>",
