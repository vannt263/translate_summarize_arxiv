    "using these results , a matrix model was developed to model deconfinement .",
    "these models involve zero @xcite , one @xcite , and two @xcite parameters .",

    "the phase transition at infinite @xmath1 is exceptional , and can be termed a gross - witten - wadia transition @xcite . for the deconfining transition ,",
    "such a transition was first seen to occur on a femto - sphere @xcite .",
    "for such a transition , at infinite @xmath1 it exhibits aspects of both first and second order phase transitions .",
    "it is of first order in that the latent heat is nonzero and proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "it is also first order in that the polyakov loop jumps from @xmath7 to @xmath8 at @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is of second order in that several quantities , such as the specific heat , exhibit nontrivial critical exponents .",
    "such an unusual transition only occurs at infinite @xmath1 , as at finite @xmath1 the transition is of first order .",
    "consider a phase transition which can be characterized by the change of a single field .",
    "if the transition is of first order , then at the transition temperature there are two degenerate minima , with a nonzero barrier between them . then the order - disorder interface tension is nonzero , given by the probability to tunnel between the two minima .",
    "conversely , if the transition is of second order , at the transition temperature the two minima coincide .",
    "then there is no barrier to tunnel between them , and the order - disorder interface tension vanishes .    in a gauge theory asking about",
    "the potential is more subtle . in a matrix model of an @xmath0 gauge theory , the potential exists in @xmath9 dimensions ( the number of commuting diagonal generators ) .",
    "a physical question is to ask how the interface tensions behave , especially at the phase transition .",
    "there are two such interface tensions .",
    "there is the usual order - disorder interface tension , which exists only at @xmath2 .",
    "there are also order - order interface tensions @xcite , which are directly related to the t hooft loops for @xmath10 charges @xcite .",

    "that is , at @xmath2 there are two distinict minima , as expected for a first order transition .",
    "nevertheless , because the potential is flat at @xmath13 between the two minima , there is no barrier to tunnel between them , and so the interface tensions vanish .",
    "such a flat potential was first found for the gross - witten - wadia transition on a femto - sphere @xcite .    as noted , in a gauge theory",

    "while we estimate the behavior of the ( order - order ) interface tensions for @xmath22 , we can not solve the problem in full generality .",
    "this is because away from @xmath2 , _ all _ @xmath19 contribute , and it is a much more difficult problem than at @xmath2 .    the order - disorder interface tension has been measured through numerical simulations on the lattice at @xmath23 by beinlich , karsch , and peikert @xcite .",
    "lucini , teper , and wenger give results for the order - disorder interface tension for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , and use these to extrapolate to @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "the order - order interface tension exhibits casimir scaling @xcite @xmath84 an important question to address is whether the order - order interface tension satisfies casimir scaling in the matrix model .",
    "an interface tension necessarily involves a spatial gradient along the @xmath80 direction .",
    "consequently , the kinetic term must be included .",
    "since the potential is simple when written in terms of the eigenvalue density @xmath85 , it is useful to write the kinetic term in terms of the same variable as well . assuming that there is a spatial gradient only along the @xmath80 direction , @xmath86 where the partial derivative is taken at fixed @xmath87 .",

    "@xcite ) @xmath91      for simplicity consider the interface tension at @xmath2 first . at the transition",
    "there are both order - order interface and order - disorder interfaces . due to the complicated form of the kinetic energy eq . , solving for the full solution of the interface seems to be hopeless .",
    "however , the presence of the zero modes allows us to show that both interface tensions vanish .",
    "it is straightforward to construct an interface using the shift mode : @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 at two boundaries of the interface .",
    "a @xmath69-wall interpolating two vacua related by @xmath95 transformation corresponds to @xmath96 .",

    ", action vanishes as @xmath102 , and so the interface tension vanishes at @xmath2 .",
    "this does not work for the shift mode .",

    "therefore , we conclude that the interface built by the shift mode is ruled out by the divergent kinetic energy .",
    "a second possibility is to build an interface with the @xmath66-mode .",

    "it is sufficient to restrict ourselves to the first line .",
    "it is easy to find the gradient @xmath117 where here and in the following primes denote the derivatives with respect to the argument .",

    "it is remarkable , that the potential flattens from the side of the confinement point @xmath245 .",
    "the potential maximum characterizes the order - disorder and order - order interface tensions and it falls like @xmath246 for large n , which is in qualitatively agreement with large @xmath1 expansion , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : umax ] ) .",
    "the matrix model studied here is clearly only one of many possible matrix models .",
    "its advantage is that it can be solved analytically at infinite @xmath1 , and numerically at finite @xmath1 . in this model",
    "all interface tensions vanish at the deconfining phase transition .",
    "since the transition is of first order , this would be striking evidence that it is an unusual transition , perhaps of the gross - witten - wadia type .",
    "presently , numerical simulations of @xmath0 gauge theories can only be carried out at relatively small @xmath1 , @xmath247 . for two colors",
    "the order - disorder interface tension vanishes , as the transition is of second order . for three colors one",
    "the order - disorder interface tension is relatively small @xcite .",
    "this presumably reflects that the transition for three colors is weakly first order , because of its proximity to the second order transition for two colors .",
    "this leads one to expect that as @xmath1 increases , that the order - disorder interface tension , divided by @xmath50 , increases monotonically from @xmath248 , and becomes constant at infinite @xmath1 .",
    "the numerical solution of the matrix model indicates the contrary , that the order - disorder interface tension , divided by @xmath50 , behaves non - monotically with @xmath1 . from fig .",
    "( [ fig : umax ] ) , the barrier of the potential , suitably normalized , increases from @xmath248 to @xmath249 , and then slowly decreases as @xmath1 increases further .",
    "such non - monotonic behavior in @xmath1 is unexpected , and could well just be an artifact of the model .",
    "this could be settled by numerical studies on the lattice of the order - disorder interface tension for moderate values of @xmath5",
    ". it might even provide hints of a gross - witten - wadia transition at infinite @xmath1 .",
