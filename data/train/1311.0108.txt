    "universal properties exhibited in continuous quantum phase transitions are controlled by low energy levels .",
    "@xcite these universal properties are often described by critical exponents which are not sensitive to the microscopic information of a system .",
    "it is well known that the universal static properties of a @xmath6 dimensional quantum system correspond to those of a @xmath7 dimensional classical system .",
    "@xcite this correspondence can be seen from the imaginary - time path integral .",
    "@xcite however , there is no direct mapping between classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "it is thus expected that dynamic quantum criticality has some unique properties .",
    "@xcite in fact , in contrast to the classical one , quantum critical dynamics can not be separated from the statics .",
    "@xcite therefore , dynamics is pivotal to understand quantum phase transitions . besides its fundamental interest",
    ", it may lead to better control in adiabatic quantum computations .",
    "@xcite    a lot of efforts have indeed been devoted to understand dynamic quantum criticality .",
    "experimental advances have provided effective platforms to manipulate and observe accurately dynamic quantum critical behavior .",
    "@xcite when a system is driven across its quantum critical point , the kibble - zurek mechanism  @xcite predicts the scaling of the density of defects generated due to the breakdown of adiabaticity in the impulse region .",
    "finite - time scaling just fits the nonequilibrium dynamics in this region in which the driving time is shorter than the reaction time and accounts for the scaling found in the region .",
    "@xcite when a system is subjected to a sudden quench near its quantum critical point , universal properties have also been found at long times when properties of the ground state dominate .",
    "@xcite    here , we shall focus on universal behavior in short times after a sudden quench .",
    "apparently , this short - time dynamics depends on the realization of the initial states .",
    "when a system is suddenly quenched off its critical point , universal short - time behavior has been shown to exist , @xcite because at short times , dynamic behavior is still controlled by the energy levels near the ground state . a universal scaling relation connecting the short - time dynamics to the long - time dynamics",
    "was also found .",
    "@xcite in contrast , when a parameter is initially set at a noncritical value and then suddenly quenched to the critical point , does universal short - time behavior exist either ?",
    "this question is partly motivated by the discovery and application of universal short - time dynamics in the relaxational critical process in classical phase transitions.@xcite when a classical system is suddenly quenched from very high temperature with a small magnetization @xmath0 and vanishing correlation to the critical region , it has been found that there exists a new short - time stage showing universal behavior.@xcite right after the quench , the evolution of the system is dominated by microscopic details and so no universal scaling behavior exists . at long times , the system comes to the period characterized by the familiar power - law decay . in this region , the order parameter varies with time as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are static critical exponents defined by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the temperature and @xmath13 the critical temperature ) and the correlation length @xmath14 , respectively , in the equilibrium situation and @xmath15 is the dynamic critical exponent defined by @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the correlation time . in between , the system enters the short - time stage characterized by a ",
    "critical initial slip\",@xcite where @xmath1 increases surprisingly as @xmath18 with a new universal initial - slip exponent @xmath4 .",
    "as the short - time dynamics overcomes the difficulties induced by critical slowing down , it has become a powerful method to determine the critical properties.@xcite    some efforts have been attempted to extend this kind of short - time dynamics into quantum situations .",
    "@xcite the results obtained can not , however , fully reflect the quantum properties .",
    "for instance , in the one dimensional ( 1d ) transverse field ising model , the dynamic exponent obtained based on the metropolis dynamics of quantum monte carlo is @xmath19,@xcite which apparently disagrees with the exact result @xmath20.@xcite this is because the metropolis dynamics can not catch the properties of quantum dynamics.@xcite therefore , in contrast to the kibble - zurek mechanism which has been proved to be applicable in both quantum and classical dynamics,@xcite it is still unclear whether similar short - time dynamics is applicable to quantum situations or not .",
    "study of real - time quantum dynamics is hindered by lack of effective numerical methods .",
    "for example , powerful monte carlo methods fail to grasp the unitary properties of quantum dynamics because of the sign problem.@xcite it is also a challenge to calculate real - time evolution in density - matrix renormalization - group methods.@xcite fortunately , recent studies of imaginary - time quantum dynamics shed some light on this problem.@xcite firstly , imaginary - time evolutions are readily realized in quantum monte carlo  @xcite and time - dependent density - matrix renormalization - group methods @xcite and are in fact a popular method in determining the ground state .",
    "@xcite secondly , some properties are shared in both real - time and imaginary - time evolutions .",
    "for example , a critical quench in the imaginary - time direction confirms the kibble - zurek mechanism predicted in real - time dynamics.@xcite another example is that the universal real - time dynamic behavior of the kinetic energy per length in the tomonaga - luttinger model is the same as its imaginary - time evolution except the early oscillations in the real - time situation.@xcite so , imaginary - time evolutions have demonstrated their power in the study of quantum dynamics , although analytic continuation does not always work.@xcite    in this paper , we explore primarily the universal properties of short - time quantum critical dynamics in the imaginary time direction .",
    "a scaling theory is proposed which can account for both the short - time and long - time universal properties .",
    "the initial state is chosen to be a direct product state with a vanishing correlation length .",
    "such a state has no entanglement and can have an arbitrarily small magnetization @xmath0 .",
    "similar to the classical situation , a universal critical initial slip characterized by @xmath3 for small @xmath0 appears after the non - universal transient in imaginary time @xmath2 .",
    "however , @xmath21 for the 1d transverse field ising model , in sharp difference from its classical counterpart , which is @xmath22  @xcite for the 2d classical ising model .",
    "thus @xmath4 is a new quantum dynamic exponent .",
    "besides @xmath4 , the universal short - time dynamics is also characterized by critical exponents that are identical with those describing the long - time behavior .    an effective method based on the short imaginary - time quantum - critical dynamics ( sitqcd )",
    "is then developed to determine the quantum critical properties .",
    "an apparent advantage is that this method circumvents critical slowing down which also manifests in quantum phase transitions .",
    "we shall show that this method is applicable to phase transitions both in the landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm and of topological nature .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . after introducing briefly the imaginary - time evolution in sec .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the imaginary time evolution of a quantum system described by a hamiltonian @xmath24 .",

    "( [ sscheq ] ) . for an initial state with nonzero projection on the ground state",
    ", @xmath34 can be explicitly calculated by expanding the initial state @xmath35 in the energy representation @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the @xmath39th eigenstate of @xmath24 with the eigenvalue @xmath40 ordered with @xmath39 and @xmath41 represents the energy gap of the system . in the third line of eq .",
    "( [ sscheq1 ] ) , we have discarded an overall factor .",
    "also , the contributions from higher energy levels have been ignored as they decay much faster than the contribution from the first excited state . from eq .",
    "( [ sscheq1 ] ) , it can be seen that the coefficients of the excited states decay exponentially at long times and the characteristic decay time is the correlation time @xmath42 . as a consequence , for a gapped system",
    ", its ground state can be readily found.@xcite unfortunately , when a system approaches its critical point , @xmath43 and thus @xmath44 tends to infinity .",
    "this is the critical slowing down occurring with critical behavior in quantum phase transitions .",
    "here we are interested in whether or not there exists any universal behavior hidden in the short times .",
    "in this section , we propose a phenomenological scaling theory for sitqcd and apply it to the von neumann entropy for entanglement in a 1d quantum system .",
    "we choose the initial state as a direct product state with a small initial value of order parameter @xmath0 . therefore at @xmath45 , the correlation length and the correlation time are both zero .",
    "in analogy with the classical situation,@xcite we suggest that after a transient period of a microscopic time scale @xmath46 , the scaling transformation of the order parameter @xmath1 near a quantum critical point is given by @xmath47 for a rescaling of factor @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the distance to the quantum critical point and @xmath50 is a new exponent to be related to the initial exponent @xmath4 below .",
    "we have neglected dimensional factors for simplicity .",
    "equation ( [ op ] ) is assumed to describe the universal behavior of the order parameter in both long times and short times after @xmath46 .    to see the initial slip",

    "( [ op ] ) becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a scaling function related to @xmath1 ( similar definitions will always be implied ) . for @xmath54 and small @xmath55 , we expand the right hand side of eq .",

    "( [ op2 ] ) , one sees that when @xmath2 is small , @xmath58 .",
    "this is the critical initial slip in which @xmath1 increases with @xmath2 . near @xmath59",
    ", there happens a crossover from the initial slip to the power - law decay stage in which @xmath60,@xcite because at late times the initial condition becomes irrelevant and so does the related argument .",
    "note that @xmath61 decreases as @xmath0 increases similar to the classical case.@xcite    the effect of deviations from the critical point can be taken into account . for @xmath62 , @xmath63 is now a function of @xmath64 .",
    "so , if this argument is small , i.e. , @xmath65 , which means that the ( imaginary ) time is shorter than the correlation time , we can expand in it and get @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the leading contribution from the finite @xmath49 , where eq .",
    "( [ op3 ] ) has been used .",
    "the reason for this cross term is that if @xmath68 , @xmath1 will keeps zero in both the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phases after a quench starting from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "equation ( [ dopig ] ) shows that for @xmath69 , @xmath70 deviates from @xmath71 to different directions depending on the sign of @xmath49 .",
    "we can of course choose different rescaling factors and obtain different scaling forms from eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) such as @xmath72 and @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the initial slip appears when @xmath76 as well as @xmath77 and @xmath78 , while the long - time decay occurs in the other limits .",
    "crossovers happen near @xmath79 , @xmath80 as well as @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "these scaling forms all describe the same scaling behavior and any one can be applied to study both short - time and long - time behaviors as they are related to each other .",
    "a peculiar property in quantum criticality is the entanglement near the critical point .",
    "entanglement is usually measured by the von neumann entropy , which is defined by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the reduced density matrix of half of the system.@xcite for a 1d system near its critical point , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the central charge.@xcite this property is shared by both symmetry - breaking phase transitions and topological phase transitions.@xcite for the universal short imaginary time evolution , substituting @xmath85 into @xmath86 leads to @xmath87 thus we have @xmath88 where @xmath89 at the critical point @xmath54 , upon expanding the scaling function @xmath90 in @xmath55 , @xmath91 becomes @xmath92 where odd order terms equal to zero because @xmath93 arises from the correlation function that includes two @xmath1 and so is an even function of @xmath0 .",
    "similar to the order parameter , we can write the scaling form  ( [ fxi ] ) in other forms .",
    "for example , @xmath94 this enables us to further check the scaling of the entanglement entropy .",

    "both a mean - field theory and numerical results will be presented .",
    "we find that although mean - field theories have been reported to be able to explain some experimental results in short real - time dynamics,@xcite our mean - field theory does not predict the imaginary - time initial slip in disagreement with the numerical results .",
    "we take the @xmath23d transverse field ising model as an example .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the pauli matrices in @xmath98 and @xmath15 direction , respectively , at site @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the transverse field .",

    "the itebd algorithm represents a state in a matrix product form and every site is attached by such a matrix .",
    "these matrices are updated according to the local evolution operators , which is obtained by the suzuki - trotter decomposition of @xmath112 .",
    "when a system is translational invariant , only the matrices in a primitive cell need to be considered .",
    "thus the itebd method can simulate an infinite - size lattice efficiently .",

    "the time interval is chosen as @xmath113 .",
    "this time interval is chosen by a compromise between these two kinds of errors .",
    "apparently , a smaller time interval will decrease the errors from the discretization , but increases the errors from the accumulation of the truncations since more steps are needed . for model  ( [ hising ] ) , we keep @xmath114 states .",
    "we have tested that for more kept states and smaller time intervals , the results have no appreciable changes . although the fitting error in our calculation is tiny as we shall see , three decimal places are kept in our results from fitting .",
