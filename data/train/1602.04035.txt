    "the extraction of a @xmath11 signal from the measured mass spectrum of @xmath12 pairs produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) requires very precise knowledge of the expected @xmath11 and @xmath13 mass spectra .",
    "if the mass of the @xmath12 pairs is reconstructed with perfect resolution then analysis is simple .",
    "however , in reality the analysis is complicated by the missing energy carried by neutrinos from @xmath1-decays , the resolution of the measurements of the energies of the various particles in the final state , and , last but not the least , the adequate modelling of the photon radiation processes .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the robustness of experimental evidence of the @xmath11 decays extracted from data collected at the lhc  reported by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite and considered as the direct confirmation of the higgs - boson coupling to fermions .",
    "we focus our investigation on the processes of radiation of photons by muons and @xmath1-leptons .",
    "these processes become particularly important for the higgs - signal search strategy in which the dominant @xmath13 background is modelled using @xmath14 events .",
    "this modelling , customarily called _ the embedding procedure _ , was used by both the atlas and cms collaborations in their respective analyses @xcite .",
    "the embedding procedure exposes the analyses to the necessity of taking into account and applying the qed radiative corrections , which are specific to this procedure .",
    "the study presented in this paper demonstrates that they are large and could explain all the excess of events interpreted as the @xmath15 signal .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "the atlas and cms embedding procedure is summarised in section [ embedding ] .",
    "section [ corrections ] starts with an introductory discussion of the radiative corrections to the @xmath16-boson leptonic decays .",
    "this discussion is followed by a presentation of the monte carlo tools used in the analysis of the qed radiative processes associated with the @xmath3-boson decays into @xmath1 and @xmath17 pairs .",
    "we analyse the dependence of radiative corrections on the assumed parton distributions , fragmentation model , handling of processes involving multi - photon emissions , in order to asses the theoretical precision of the results presented in subsequent sections of this paper .",
    "finally , in section [ corrections ] we discuss the size of the radiative corrections for an analysis based on the embedding procedure and its dependence on the experimental resolution of the reconstructed invariant mass of @xmath18 pairs . in section [ bias ]",
    "we present our predictions for the excess of events by properly taking into account radiative photons in the modelling of the @xmath2 background .",
    "we compare this excess with that of the predicted higgs - boson signal . in our study",
    "we follow the published atlas and cms analyses @xcite . in section",
    "[ overlooked ] we discuss why the radiative corrections effects were not given sufficient attention in the atlas and cms analyses . in section [ forward ]",
    "we propose a list of tests that can check experimentally the size of the radiative correction effects and discriminate between signatures of higgs - boson decays versus missing radiative corrections in the modelling of the @xmath2 background .",
    "the conclusions of the paper are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the @xmath12-decays of @xmath3-bosons produced by the drell  yan process are the dominant source of background for @xmath21 searches at the lhc .",
    "the background evaluation method is common for both atlas and cms analyses @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 decays are modelled using _ embedded event samples _ in loosely selected @xmath22 data .",
    "these event samples are recorded for each data taking period . in the embedding procedure",
    "muon tracks and their associated energy depositions in the calorimeters are replaced by a simulated detector response to the final - state particles of the corresponding @xmath1-lepton decays .    in deriving the momentum vectors of the embedded @xmath1-leptons ,",
    "the momentum vectors of the corresponding muons are used .",
    "these vectors are determined using the muon tracks reconstructed from the central tracker and muon spectrometer hits .",
    "the @xmath1-momentum vectors are calculated by taking the energies of the corresponding muons and correcting the @xmath17-momentum vectors for the effect of the muon and @xmath1-lepton mass difference .",
    "the energy depositions in the calorimeter which are identified as being associated with the outgoing muons are removed .",
    "next , the detector response to the @xmath1-leptons is simulated . in the initial simulation step the radiation of photons and the decays of @xmath1-leptons",
    "are generated . in the final step the response of the tracker and of the calorimeters to the @xmath1-lepton decay products",
    "are simulated .",
    "there are several advantages of the embedding technique : the sensitivity to the monte carlo modelling aspects of the hadronic system associated with the @xmath3-boson production is minimised , the pile - up effects are automatically taken into account in the background simulation , including the underlying event activity .",
    "however , as discussed in the next section , there is a price to pay for such a simplification of the background estimation technique .",
    "leptons produced in @xmath3-boson decays radiate photons .",
    "the probability of radiation depends on the lepton mass .",
    "electrons radiate photons more frequently than muons , muons more frequently than @xmath1-leptons .",
    "the difference of probabilities is proportional to the logarithm of the squares of the leptons masses , @xmath23 .    in order to describe the observed invariant mass distributions of pairs of leptons produced in @xmath16-decays ,",
    "the processes of final - state photon radiation ( fsr ) have to be modelled and the corresponding radiative corrections should be taken into account .",
    "the size of the radiative corrections depends not only on the lepton type , but also on the lepton detection apparatus , the experimental cuts and the reconstruction method of the lepton momentum vector .",
    "radiative corrections for the measurements of the lepton momentum which include information of radiated photons reconstructed in the calorimeter are sizeably smaller than those based on its momentum vector solely measured from the curvature of the lepton track .",
    "in this paper we use the term _ bare leptons _ for those which have their momentum vector reconstructed solely from the track parameters and the term _ dressed leptons _ for an idealised case in which all the radiative photons are assigned to their lepton emitters and the photon measured momenta are used in the reconstruction of the initial momentum vector of the leptons .",
    "the radiative corrections for the bare - lepton - based measurements are large , while the ones based on the dressed leptons are small . in general",
    ", the size of the radiative corrections may vary within the above boundaries .",
    "their numerical values are detector- and analysis - dependent , and reflect the efficiency of algorithms , which assign the photon energy depositions in the calorimeters to the respective outgoing leptons .",
    "the photon radiation by @xmath1-leptons has an additional subtlety with respect to photon radiation by stable electrons and long - lived muons .",
    "photons may originate both from the @xmath1-lepton radiation and from the @xmath1 decays .",
    "since neutrinos produced in the @xmath1 decays remain undetected , it is hardly possible to experimentally identify the photon origin on an event - by - event basis from the reconstructed @xmath1-mass .    at first sight",
    "the qed radiative effects should play a negligible role in the determination of the strength of the @xmath4 decay signal .",
    "this is perhaps why the necessity to evaluate the radiative correction to the embedding procedure escaped attention . as discussed in subsection  [ false - signal ] , these corrections , for a realistic detector resolution and for the adapted measurement strategy , are large and can not be neglected .    in advance of a quantitative analysis of the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure , we first present the monte carlo tools used in our analysis and evaluate their precision .",
    "the inclusive cross section for the @xmath21 decays is , in the lhc energy range , three orders of magnitude lower than that for @xmath24 decays .",
    "this 10@xmath25 ratio defines the precision _ yard - stick _ for the requisite theoretical and experimental control of the @xmath24 background .    in the studies presented in this paper we use the monte carlo event generator  @xcite",
    "this program simulates the single @xmath26-boson production with leptonic decays in hadronic collisions , i.e.  the charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) single drell ",
    "yan ( dy ) processes .",

    "( fsr ) in @xmath3 decays with the use of an iterative algorithm in which resummation of leading qed radiative effects is improved with a matrix - element ( me ) correction to account for sub - leading , mainly @xmath28 , effects .",

    "@xcite that  reproduces very well the exact @xmath28 fsr corrections . in this paper",
    "we refer to the generator based on the   and   interface as @xmath29 .",

    "however , in order to generate realistic kinematical distributions of @xmath16 , it is interfaced with the  6.4 generator @xcite , which performs the initial - state qcd ( and qed ) parton shower , the appropriate proton - remnant treatment and the necessary hadronisation / decays .",
    "this interface provides an improved generation of lepton transverse momenta with respect to the original  6 program , which results in a good agreement with the nlo qcd predictions ; for details see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the studies presented in this paper we use as the base - line the cteq6.1 parametrisation of pdfs @xcite .",
    "other parametrisations , such as mstw2008nnlo @xcite , are considered as a cross - check of the pdf - dependence of the @xmath3 kinematical distributions .    for our studies of the qed fsr effects we use  in its best set - up , i.e.  with multi - photon radiation including the me correction . to see how important are the sub - leading @xmath28 fsr corrections we also perform computations with the me correction switched off . in order to cross -",
    "check the @xmath29  results , we use the  monte carlo event generator @xcite .",
    "it features the @xmath30 yfs exclusive exponentiation of qed radiative corrections in the process of @xmath3 production and decay .",
    "its main advantages with respect to  are : inclusion of initial - final state radiation interferences , the exact @xmath30 fsr corrections and a better overall normalisation ( includes the radiative corrections , which is not the case in ) .",
    "initially  was developed for @xmath31 colliders , such as lep , but recently it has been adapted also for hadron colliders by adding quark beams and a possibility of their convolution with pdfs .",
    "it was already used to assess the size of the second - order qed correction to the @xmath32 observable for the nc dy process at the lhc @xcite .    since we want to follow closely the analysis of the lhc experiments , instead of using the qcd @xmath33-factors , we normalise the @xmath16-boson and higgs - boson cross sections to the values used in the atlas analysis @xcite .    the analysis shown in the current and in the following sections is made for the @xmath34 centre - of - mass collision energy of @xmath35tev and the event - acceptance cuts : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , respectively , the pseudo - rapidity , the transverse momentum of each of the leptons ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) and the invariant mass of the opposite - sign lepton pairs .             in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present the results of the generator - level precision evaluation of the tools used in this analysis . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we show the born - level invariant - mass distribution of the @xmath18 pairs which originate from @xmath16-boson decays and from higgs - boson decays . at the event generator level",
    "the higgs - boson peak is clearly visible above the @xmath3-boson background .",
    "the qed fsr corrections ( @xmath42 ) to the bare - dilepton invariant mass distribution @xmath39 , for the @xmath3 decays , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , separately for @xmath1-pair and for @xmath17-pair final states .",
    "as expected , the radiative corrections for the @xmath1 case are significantly ( @xmath43 times ) smaller than those for the @xmath17 case .",
    "the fsr corrections are positive below the @xmath44-boson mass peak and can be as large as @xmath45 for muons and @xmath46 for taus . at @xmath47 the corrections change sign and",
    "become negative . in the higgs - boson region ( @xmath48gev )",
    "the corrections are about @xmath49 for muons and about @xmath50 for taus .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c we show that the sensitivity of a realistic simulation of the @xmath3-boson four - momentum for @xmath17-pair final states to pdf parametrisations and to  parton - shower and hadronisation effects is small .",
    "we use cteq6.1 pdfs with and without , and mstw2008nnlo pdfs with . as can be seen ,",
    "all three curves are on top of each other . clearly , the results for the fsr corrections do not depend , within a 1% , on the qcd patron - shower and hadronisation effects , or on the choice of the pdfs parametrisation .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d , we present the study of effects of various approximations used in the calculations of the qed radiative corrections .",
    "we compare two running modes of : ( 1 ) its best set - up , i.e.  multi - photon radiation including the me correction , denoted as photos - best , and ( 2 ) the multi - photon radiation without the me correction , denoted as photos - ll .",
    "the differences between these two results are very small , below @xmath51 , and are not visible in the plot .",
    "this shows that the me correction in , which accounts for the sub - leading @xmath28 qed effects , is not important for the studies presented here .",
    "nevertheless , our main results are obtained using  in its best set - up . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d , we also compare the @xmath29  radiative corrections with those of . here",
    "the differences are also barely visible in the plot : they reach up to @xmath52 below the @xmath44-boson mass peak and up to @xmath53 above it . these can be attributed to the differences between  and  discussed earlier .",
    "we have checked that these differences are almost identical for the @xmath1 and @xmath17 cases .",
    "therefore , as far as the difference of the radiative corrections for muons and taus is concerned , they are negligible .",
    "the same is true for the purely weak corrections .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath29  is adequate for our study of the qed fsr influence on the background to the @xmath54 signal in the lhc run 1 data . in the future , with increased statistical and systematic precision of the lhc data , using more precise mc generators , such as , may be necessary .",
    "the above study demonstrates that at the generator level the radiative corrections for the nc dy process are well controlled . in the mass region",
    "relevant for the higgs signal they are small compared to the signal itself .",
    "one could thus expect that they would have a negligible impact on the experimental determination of the @xmath21 signal at the present statistical precision .",
    "this is indeed the case for the classical analysis , in which the radiative effects are implemented in all the background mc generators and the treatment of simulated and data events is the same .    in the following subsection we demonstrate that this statement no longer holds for the embedding - procedure - based analysis which uses real rather than generated events .",
    "as discussed earlier , we use the term _ bare leptons _ for those which have their momentum vector reconstructed solely from the track parameters and the term _ dressed leptons _ for an idealised case in which all the radiative photons are assigned to their lepton emitters and the photon measured momenta are used in the reconstruction of the initial momentum vector of the leptons .",
    "therefore the dressed lepton , as far as the fsr is concerned , is equivalent to a born lepton .",
    "if in the extraction of the higgs signal , data are compared to complete monte carlo simulations of @xmath55 and @xmath56 events , the analysis would be consistent . in the analyses of @xcite",
    "a fully simulated @xmath56 sample is used .",
    "however , the @xmath55 sample is obtained by embedding @xmath1-leptons in a sample of @xmath57 data .",
    "had dressed @xmath1-leptons been used to replace dressed muons in data , the analysis would still be consistent",
    ". however , what is done instead , is to replace bare muons in data with simulated dressed @xmath1-leptons .",
    "the necessity of taking into account the qed fsr corrections to the embedding procedure has its origin in the interplay of the following three effects :    * in the embedding procedure bare muons in data are replaced by simulated dressed @xmath1-leptons , * the measurement resolution of the invariant mass of two opposite - charge @xmath1-leptons ( @xmath18 ) is comparable to the mass difference between the @xmath44-boson and the higgs boson , * the inclusive cross section for @xmath3-bosons decaying into leptons is three orders of magnitude larger than that for the higgs boson .    the interplay of the above three effects is illustrated in fig .",
    "the upper left plot ( a ) , shows the difference between the @xmath29  differential cross section plotted as a function of the invariant mass of the @xmath18 pair , @xmath58 , for the generated sample of the @xmath55 decays and for the corresponding cross section for the case , where the @xmath1-lepton momenta are determined using the embedded @xmath59 sample .",
    "we call the differential cross - section difference : @xmath60 _ the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure_. note , that these corrections are additive rather than multiplicative .",
    "such a representation is appropriate for the studies of radiative corrections which are  non - local \" , i.e. for the case when their size in each mass bin is an integral over the born cross section for a wide mass interval .",
    "the procedure of association of the radiative photons with the parent @xmath1-leptons in the reconstruction is not discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can not provide in this paper a precise estimate of the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure .",
    "instead , we estimate upper and lower boundaries of the radiative corrections .",
    "below we refer to these two boundaries as ( 1 ) _ dressed corrections _ , and ( 2 ) _ bare corrections_.    the two distributions shown in fig .  [ fig2]a reflect the following two possible outcomes of the reconstruction of the outgoing @xmath1-lepton momenta in generated @xmath61 decays : ( 1 ) the momenta of the dressed @xmath1-leptons  represented by the dashed line ( dressed corrections ) and ( 2 ) the momenta of the bare @xmath1-leptons  represented by the dots ( bare corrections ) .",
    "these correspond to boundaries on the size of the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure .",
    "if , in the event - by - event experimental reconstruction procedure of the @xmath1-lepton momenta , all photons radiated by each of the @xmath1-leptons were reconstructed from the electromagnetic energy clusters in the calorimeters and if they were unambiguously associated to one of the outgoing @xmath1-leptons , contributing to its momentum reconstruction , the radiative corrections would be those represented by the dashed line .",
    "if , on the other hand , all the calorimetric energy depositions of photons coming from the initial @xmath1-lepton radiation ( before its decay ) were not associated to their parent @xmath1-leptons , the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure would have the values represented by the dots .    the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a represents the cross section for the @xmath21 decay signal for the case of perfect resolution .",
    "it is significantly higher than the size of the radiative corrections .",
    "thus , are the radiative corrections irrelevant while establishing the existence of the higgs - boson signal ? if the invariant mass of the @xmath1-lepton pairs , @xmath58 , could be reconstructed with the precision comparable to that for the muon pairs , the answer would be affirmative and the discussion in this chapter could be considered as purely academic . in reality , however , the mass of the @xmath1-lepton pairs is reconstructed with finite resolution , insufficient to assign the @xmath1-lepton pairs to either the @xmath3-boson or higgs - boson source , on an event - by - event basis .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b  d we show the size of the radiative correction to the embedding procedure for the following three values of @xmath62 specifying the gaussian smearing of the reconstructed @xmath58 : @xmath62 = 10 , 20 and 30 gev . already for the @xmath63 gev smearing , the values of the radiative corrections in the mass region of 110140  gev are comparable to the higgs - boson signal .",
    "the size of the corrections increases rapidly , in the higgs signal mass region , with worsening resolution ( increasing @xmath62 ) , outweighing the higgs - boson signal already for @xmath62 = 20  gev .",
    "we recall that these plots were made for the inclusive event sample specified by the kinematical cuts defined in the previous section .",
    "it is evident that , for any realistic detector and , in particular , in the presence of escaping neutrinos , these corrections must be considered with great care .",
    "it is also important to note that the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure have a positive sign in the mass region above the @xmath44-boson mass peak and a negative sign below it .",
    "if not taken into account , the @xmath61 background to the higgs searches , determined using the embedding procedure , would be significantly ( with respect to the higgs - boson signal strength ) underestimated in the higgs - boson mass search region above @xmath44-boson mass and overestimated for masses smaller than the @xmath44-boson mass .",
    "it is thus precisely in the region where @xmath21 decay signals have been reported @xcite that the neglected radiative corrections to the embedding procedure may potentially produce a spurious higgs - boson signal by underestimating the background level .",
    "the atlas and cms papers discussing the @xmath21 decay evidence @xcite do not present unfolded signal and background distributions in which the detector and analysis dependent corrections are accounted for .",
    "the results presented in such a form can not , strictly speaking , be fully checked by any external analysis .",
    "the goal of the analysis presented in this section is only to provide the best possible _ initial estimate _ of the size of the missing radiative corrections in the modelling of the @xmath2 background and an initial assessment of their impact on the extraction of the @xmath21 decay signal .",
    "since several simplifications have to be made , we specify the details of these estimates , leaving to the lhc collaborations the precise determination of the size of the corrections for their respective analysis methods .    as discussed in the previous section , the effective size of the missing radiative corrections in the modelling of the @xmath2 background for the atlas and cms analyses are sensitive to the experimental resolution of the measurement of @xmath58 .",
    "the corrections also depend on the efficiencies of the event - subsample selection cuts , which were optimised in the atlas and cms analyses @xcite to enrich the @xmath21 signal with respect to all background contributions .",
    "the event - subsamples in the @xmath21 searches are classified in terms of event categories .",
    "these categories are characterised by : ( 1 ) the type of the @xmath1-lepton decays : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and ( 2 ) the event jet activity and the jet(s ) transverse momentum .",
    "cms considers 38 event categories , while atlas considers 6 categories ( more information on the event categories can be found in ref .",

    "[ fig3]a , in order to take into account the missing radiative corrections in the modelling of the @xmath2 background .",
    "such a procedure involves the following three simplifications :    1 .",
    "the @xmath58 smearing is assumed to be gaussian .",
    "the small effect of the radiative corrections to the category dependent weights , @xmath77 , which requires their redefinition as @xmath78 , where @xmath79",
    "are the category - dependent radiative corrections , is neglected .",
    "3 .   instead of calculating the radiative correction for each of the event categories , with the category - dependent @xmath80",
    ", we use its average value @xmath70 .",

    "this value is sufficiently small to justify such a simplification . in order to quantify such a statement we repeated the calculations for @xmath83  gev and for @xmath84  gev .",
    "the corresponding radiative corrections are found to stay well within the uncertainty range of the radiative corrections which spans the difference between the bare and dressed radiative corrections .    in fig .",

    "@xcite .    in our initial estimate of the radiative correction effects to the cms analysis we assume gaussian smearing of the reconstructed @xmath58 .",
    "for the atlas case we base our analysis on the published resolution functions presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the vbf and boosted categories .",
    "this allowed us to take into account non - gaussian resolution tails .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a and fig .",
    "[ fig4]b we compare the atlas @xmath58 distributions for @xmath24 decays , for the vbf and boosted configurations , with the @xmath58 distribution based on our model of the measurement resolution .",
    "the published and our model distributions are in very good agreement which validates our modelling of the experimental resolutions .",
    "all the results presented below are be based on this modelling of the experimental resolution .",
    "the resolution functions are assumed to be the same for the @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 decay modes .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )         the atlas selection criteria for the boosted and vbf categories increase the ratio of the number of accepted @xmath4 events sizeably with respect to the @xmath2 background , as compared to the fully inclusive samples .",
    "the ratios of the integrated number of the accepted @xmath4 events , @xmath92 , to the number of the accepted @xmath2 events , @xmath93 , are determined in our analysis for each event category using fig .  2 of ref .",
    "these ratios are used to calculate the corresponding ratios of the event - selection efficiencies in the atlas - analysis acceptance region @xcite : @xmath94 where superscript @xmath67 denotes the event category .",
    "the values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 taken from @xcite are @xmath97  pb and @xmath98  pb , respectively",
    ". the ratios of the event selection efficiencies are used in turn to calculate the corresponding ratios of the number of excess events that originate from the missing radiative corrections in the modelling of the @xmath2 background , to the number of expected excess events from @xmath99  gev sm higgs - boson decays in the atlas acceptance regions .",
    "these ratios , calculated for the @xmath58 region between 80 and 150 gev , and denoted as @xmath100 , can be directly compared to the values of the event - category - dependent @xmath101 parameters , which are the ratios of the observed to predicted higgs - boson coupling strength to @xmath1-leptons in each event category @xcite .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a we reproduce fig .  10 taken from the published atlas paper @xcite , which shows the @xmath102 values for each event category .",
    "these values can be interpreted as the event - category - dependent ratios of the number of the observed excess events , with respect to the sm background predictions , @xmath103 , to the respective number of events originating from the higgs - boson decays : @xmath104 , where , as before , @xmath67 specifies the event category .",
    "if the excess of the observed events is produced only by @xmath4 decays , then @xmath105 .",
    "we refer to this case as _ the higgs - only hypothesis_. if the observed excess of events is fully accounted for by the missing radiative corrections in the modelling of the @xmath2 background , @xmath106 , then @xmath107 .",
    "we refer to this case as the _ the fsr - only hypothesis_. finally , if the observed excess of events is accounted for by contributions from both mechanisms , @xmath108 .",
    "we refer to this case as the _ the fsr+higgs hypothesis_.    \\(a ) ( b )         in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b we compare the values of @xmath109 taken from fig .",
    "[ fig5]a with the @xmath110 values , for each event category .",
    "the upper boundaries of the shadowed regions for the @xmath110 values correspond to dressed corrections and the lower boundaries correspond to bare corrections .",
    "the first observation is that the fsr - only hypothesis provides a satisfactory description of the data  the discrepancy with the data is always less than 1@xmath111 and the @xmath85-value for this hypothesis is @xmath112 .",
    "again , as in the cms case , @xmath110 is calculated for the arithmetic mean of the predictions for the bare and dressed radiative corrections with the prediction error taken as a half of the difference of these predictions .",
    "contrary to the cms case , for atlas the fsr+higgs hypothesis is the most probable .",
    "the @xmath85-value for this hypothesis is @xmath113 , slightly better than for the fsr - only hypothesis .",
    "therefore , although the atlas data does not require a contribution from higgs - boson decays to explain the observed excess of events , a contribution from higgs - boson decay can not be ruled out given the level of current experimental uncertainties .",
    "it is intriguing that our prediction for the excess of events originating from the missing radiative corrections in the modelling of the @xmath2 background for the preselected vbf samples is about a factor of 2 lower than the prediction for the boosted samples . a similar effect ( at a level of 1@xmath111 )",
    "is observed in the atlas data .",
    "the value of @xmath109 for the vbf category is also about a factor of 2 lower than that for the boosted category .",
    "this effect calls for a further comment .",
    "our predictions of the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure for the atlas case , in particular the ratio of the size of the effect for the vbf and boosted categories , rely fully on the atlas - analysis - specific efficiencies for the selection of higgs - decay events in the monte carlo signal sample and for the selection of @xmath16-boson - decay events in the embedded data sample . in the atlas analysis",
    "the monte carlo events for the vbf higgs production category are generated with the powheg@xmath29pythia8 generators @xcite . as shown in an earlier atlas paper @xcite ,",
    "devoted to the vbf @xmath16-boson production process , both the powheg and sherpa @xcite generators fail to describe the data in the phase - space region @xcite which is relevant for the analysis presented here .",
    "namely , the monte carlo predictions are too high by a factor of @xmath1142 in the region of large two - jet invariant mass ( see fig .  11 in @xcite ) and should be corrected to obtain the background templates used in extraction of the @xmath16-boson vbf signal .",
    "such corrections may also be important for adequate modeling of the higgs - boson vbf signal .",
    "their absence in the higgs - boson signal analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite may explain the apparent discrepancy of the @xmath109 and @xmath110 values for the vbf and boosted categories .",
    "if both the higgs - boson and the @xmath16-boson contributions were to be taken from monte carlo the impact of these corrections on the ratio of efficiencies for the selection of higgs decay events and @xmath16-boson decay events , would be significantly smaller than in the case of the embedding procedure , and the observed discrepancy may disappear .",
    "the results presented in this section represent the initial estimation of the size of the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure for the full acceptance regions of the atlas and cms analyses .",
    "no attempt is made to determine how the effective corrections would change in more restrictive kinematical regions or for the boosted decision tree ( bdt ) based analysis , in which all the kinematical properties of the background and signal events are taken into account .",
    "since the bdt analyses of atlas and cms @xcite are based on distributions which are not corrected for detector effects , we are technically unable to provide the radiative corrections for the bdt - type of analyses . our analysis shows , however , that the atlas and cms bdt analyses should have taken into account the modifications of the templates of the kinematical distributions for the @xmath2 samples caused by the qed radiative corrections to the embedding procedure .",
    "this statement holds for the present statistical accuracy of the measurement . for a sizeably larger",
    "collected luminosity it may , in principle , be possible to reduce the size of the radiative correction effects by performing the analyses in more severely restricted phase - space regions , in which the impact of radiative corrections is diminished .",
    "the mechanism in which the missing radiative corrections in the modelling of the @xmath2 background could mimic the higgs - decay signal was communicated by one of the authors of this paper ( mwk ) to the authors of @xcite at the time of preparing these papers for publications .",
    "the reply was that the other sources contributing to the uncertainties of the embedding procedure were dominant and the effects of the missing qed radiative correction in the modelling of the @xmath2 background are already covered by the corresponding systematic errors .",
    "this was claimed to be confirmed by the monte carlo studies in which the detector simulation results for the embedded and generated @xmath2 samples were compared .    in the subsequent cms and atlas technical papers , following the @xmath4 evidence papers @xcite ,",
    "more attention has been given , by the respective groups developing the embedding procedures , to the importance of qed radiative effects .",
    "in the outlook section of the cms note devoted to the embedding procedure @xcite , the importance of quantifying the impact of the final state radiation for various embedding methods was notified but the corresponding studies were left for the future analyses .",
    "the atlas collaboration published very recently the paper on the embedding procedure @xcite .",
    "the qed radiative effects were discussed for the first time , jointly with the resolution effects of the reconstructed muon momenta . as a measure of their importance ,",
    "the distributions of the @xmath1 decay lepton transverse momentum and of the invariant mass of the visible @xmath12 decay products , @xmath115 , for generator- and detector - seeded @xmath1 embedding were presented in fig .",
    "8a , b of ref .",
    "these plots demonstrated that the effects of the uncorrected resolution and final - state radiation of the input muons are negligible in the case of reconstructed @xmath12 final states , for which the mass resolution is dominated by the neutrinos produced in the @xmath1 decay .",
    "this conclusion is indeed correct mass shown in fig .",
    "8b is clearly visible even at the 510% precision level of the studies presented in @xcite .",
    "this negative slope may be considered as a footprint of the importance of the fsr effects . ] , but only at a precision level of  510% . however , as our analysis has shown , the extrapolation of such a general conclusion to the higgs - boson searches , where higher precision is required , can not be justified .",
    "as indicated in the previous section , the excess of events attributed to the higgs signal may be a consequence of the missing qed final - state radiative correction in the modelling of the @xmath2 background . in order to discriminate , beyond any doubt , between the three hypotheses formulated in the previous section : fsr - only , higgs - only and fsr+higgs , the following experimental tests may provide additional information :    * * the @xmath116 dependence test . *",
    "+ this test boils down to selecting the event categories for which the experimental resolution of the reconstructed @xmath58 is the best , say in the @xmath117 gev @xmath118 gev range , and to performing the analysis in two subsamples of events selected below and above @xmath119 gev .",
    "if the excess of events is found to be confined to the lower mass region , the fsr - only hypothesis is favoured .",
    "if it is found to be concentrated in the higher mass region , the higgs - only hypothesis is more likely . *",
    "* the embedded @xmath120 momentum definition test . *",
    "+ here we exploit the fact that most of the large energy photons radiated by the outgoing muons coming from @xmath16-boson decays are collinear with the initial ( vertex ) outgoing muon direction .",
    "the identification of fsr photons is easier thanks to the solenoidal magnetic field in both the atlas and cms experiments .",
    "the fsr photon energy clusters reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter can be differentiated ( with a certain efficiency ) from the muon energy loss in the calorimeters because of the bending of the muons in the magnetic field .",
    "if the energy of the identified radiative photon clusters is added to muon energy which is measured by its track , the size of the radiative correction to the embedding procedure is drastically reduced .",
    "such a test can be done in particular for the vbf subsample of events , for which the transverse momentum spectrum of muons is softer than for the boosted sample . here",
    "the larger deflection in the magnetic field allows for larger separation of the radiative photon clusters and the muon energy deposition from muon interactions in the material in the electromagnetic calorimeter . by varying the association criteria of electromagnetic clusters with the muon",
    ", one can experimentally control the level of the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure in the modelling of the @xmath2 background .",
    "+ for higher energy muons one could add all the energy deposition in the electromagnetic calorimeter to the energy of the muon measured by tracking , and perform a statistical subtraction of the energy deposition component that results from direct muon interactions in the material of the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the statistical subtraction can utilize a spectrum of energy deposition simulations for muons of different momenta . *",
    "* the bare - versus - dressed @xmath120-lepton test . * + as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the size of the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure is different for these two definitions of the outgoing @xmath1-lepton momentum . in the majority of @xmath1-lepton",
    "decays the radiative photons can not be experimentally resolved and they are included in the momentum reconstruction of the dressed @xmath1-lepton .",
    "however , as far as the embedding procedure is concerned , the radiation and decays of @xmath1-leptons are generated by monte carlo programs in which the source of each photon is clearly defined .",
    "the test would consist of repeating the embedding analysis twice , for the dressed and for the bare @xmath1-lepton definitions . if the main source of the excess of  higgs - like \" events are the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure , this excess would vary in a predictable way , and the fsr - only and higgs - only hypotheses could be discriminated with respect to each other .",
    "* * the selection efficiency test .",
    "* + the size of the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure depends very strongly on the relative efficiency of selecting the higgs - like events with respect to the remaining background , in optimal restricted phase - space volumes .",
    "the embedding procedure , in which the main background is determined directly from the data , while the higgs signal is simulated using the monte carlo generated events , is prone not only to the qed radiative corrections , but also to the qcd radiative corrections , which are treated differently for data and monte carlo events .",
    "the test would consist of determining the ratio , rather than absolute values , of the selection efficiencies in a restricted kinematical region from a fixed monte carlo generator , having the same qcd approximations for the production of @xmath3 and higgs bosons .",
    "the large uncertainties of the absolute predictions cancel in this ratio .",
    "this test is of particular importance in view of the apparent discrepancy of the @xmath110 and @xmath109 values between the vbf and boosted samples of events .",
    "the @xmath110 values are driven by the ratio of efficiencies , as illustrated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : atlaseff ] ) , while the @xmath109 values carry , in addition , an imprint of the relative strength of the higgs - boson couplings to fermions and bosons . a single - monte - carlo - based measurement could be decisive for an unambiguous interpretation of the  vbf vs.  boosted \" discrepancy .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of the effects of qed final - state radiative corrections to the modelling of the @xmath61 process , which is the dominant background in the @xmath4 searches .",
    "we focus our attention on the radiative corrections to the embedding procedure used by atlas and cms to model the @xmath61 background in the extraction of the @xmath4 signal from experimental data .",
    "we make an initial estimate of the size of these corrections for the atlas and cms analyses@xcite and show that the missing radiative corrections in the embedding procedure may explain the excess of events which has been attributed to a higgs - boson signal .",
    "we propose several experimental tests which can differentiate between an excess which originates from missing qed radiative corrections in the modelling of the @xmath61 background and an excess originating from higgs - boson decays .",
    "the goal of this paper is to re - draw the attention of the cms and atlas collaborations to the importance of the effect of the qed radiative corrections to the embedding procedure for modelling the @xmath61 background .",
    "our earlier suggestions on this matter , addressed to the atlas and cms collaborations at the time of preparation of their respective papers , are now quantified by an initial estimate of the size of the effect .",
    "it is our hope that these estimates will persuade both collaborations to take into account the qed radiative corrections to their respective embedding procedures used to model the @xmath61 background in the extraction of the @xmath4 signal from current and future experimental data .",
