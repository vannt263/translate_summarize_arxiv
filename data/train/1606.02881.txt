    "it is commonly believed that the blue - shifted galaxies are relatively nearby ones whose peculiar motion overcomes the hubble flow .",
    "all of the most distant galaxies ( and indeed the overwhelming majority of all galaxies ) are red - shifted . according to the conventional definition ,",
    "the redshift of galaxies is the sum of two terms : the isotropic cosmic expansion velocity and the peculiar velocity owning to gravitational attraction by the surrounding matter . in practice ,",
    "determining the peculiar velocity of a galaxy requires knowledge of both its observable radial velocity relative to some reference system and the distance to the galaxy determined independently of the radial velocity . according to the linear theory of gravitational instability ,",
    "the peculiar velocities of galaxies are related to fluctuations in the mass ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "burbidge & demoulin ( 1969 ) first observed ic 3258 with a blueshift of @xmath1490 km@xmath0s@xmath2 .",
    "they give three possible interpretations of their observations .",
    "first , ic 3258 is a member of the virgo cluster and has a very high velocity relative to the average for the cluster .",
    "second , ic 3258 is a field galaxy closer to the virgo cluster and its large velocity is just a random motion .",
    "third , ic 3258 has velocity because it has been ejected in an outburst involving one of the radio galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "several other blue - shifted galaxies appear in the direction of the virgo cluster .    by measuring the distance @xmath5 of a galaxy",
    ", one can obtain the peculiar velocity of a galaxy @xmath6 , here @xmath7 is hubble expansion velocity , @xmath8 is observed velocity of the galaxy . since the hubble expansion velocity is small for nearby galaxies , the peculiar velocity could be negative .",
    "negative peculiar velocities are seen all over the region around the virgo cluster and this have long been seen as a reflex of the pull of the cluster on us ( aaronson et al .",
    "we live in the local supercluster , which is overdense part of the universe .",
    "so there is possibly the a local retardation of the cosmic expansion or a net infall within this region . in another example",
    ", an observer living on the outskirts of a large concentration is also pulled towards the overdense part of the clusters .    when the radiation propagates inside the collapsing body it is blue - shifted .",
    "if this blueshift is greater than the redshift caused by the propagation of the radiation through expanding universe , distant observer can detect the gravitational blueshift from the collapsing object .",
    "also the agns have blue - shifted spectrum .",
    "bian et al .",
    "( 2005 ) studied the radial velocity difference between the narrow emission - line components and of [ o iii ] @xmath9 and h@xmath10 in a sample of 150 sdss narrow - line seyfert@xmath01 galaxies .",
    "they found seven ` blue outliers ' with [ o iii ] blueshifted by more than 250 km@xmath0s@xmath2 .",
    "they interpreted the blueshift as possible result of the outflowing gas from the nucleus and the obscuration of the receding part of the flow by an optically thick accretion disk and on the viewing angle .",
    "spatial orientation of angular momentum of blue - shifted galaxies ( sdss ) has not been studied , so we are interested to carry out the spatial orientation of blue - shifted galaxies .",
    "an idea of the origin of angular momentum of galaxies is very important to understand the evolution of large scale structures of the universe .",

    "we compiled a database of @xmath11 blue - shifted galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey seventh data release ( sdss dr7 ) .",

    "1a . the inhomogeneous distribution of galaxies is because of the nature of the survey .",
    "the distribution of blue - shifted galaxies is shown in fig .",
    "we found a linear relationship between the blue - shift and logarithm of the number of galaxies ( @xmath12@xmath13log(@xmath14 ) ) .",
    "+       we have retained only those galaxies that have blue - shift ( @xmath12 ) data at 95% level of significance .",
    "this removed 569 galaxies form the original data .",
    "since blue - shift is found to be decreases lineally with number ( fig .",
    "1b ) , the remaining @xmath15 galaxies were classified into three bins by considering the bin size of @xmath16 .",
    "this resulted in three bins with number of galaxies roughly in the ratio of @xmath17 in the largest , medium and the smallest bins respectively . in the binning process ,",
    "galaxies that have very low and high blue - shift values were also removed .    since our galaxies are blue - shifted , their apparent magnitude increases with time .",
    "in order to check the effect of blue - shift on preferred alignments , we have chosen two extreme filters : infrared ( @xmath18 ) and ultraviolet ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the wavelengths of sdss @xmath18 and @xmath19 filters are 7625 @xmath20 and 3543 @xmath20 , respectively . the true magnitudes of @xmath18 filter lies in the far - infrared and @xmath19 in the visual bands .",

    "we have compiled the database of diameters and position angle of galaxies using sdss survey .",

    "our blue - shifted galaxies have negative radial velocities probably due to their larger peculiar velocity .",
    "these galaxies are mostly nearby galaxies .",
    "thus , it is convenient to use galactic coordinate system as a physical reference plane .",
    "the formulae to obtain @xmath24 and @xmath21 in are as follows ( flin & godlowski , 1986 ) : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath27 are the galactic longitude , latitude and position angle , respectively .",

    "the method of determination of intrinsic flatness of galaxies is the same as in aryal et al .",

    "thus , there are four solutions of the sv orientation for a galaxy .",
    "we count all four possibilities independently in our analysis .",
    "aryal & saurer ( 2000 ) studied the effects of various types of selections in the database and concluded that such selections may cause severe changes in the shapes of the expected isotropic distribution curves in the galaxy orientation study .",
    "their method has been applied by several authors in galaxy orientation studies ( hu et al .",
    "2006 , aryal et al .",
