    "a classical random walk is invariably associated with diffusive motion , but quantum superposition and interference allow for a more varied dynamics .",
    "a quantum walk can explore phase space more rapidly than its classical counterpart @xcite , a shift from diffusive to ballistic dynamics that is at the origin of the quadratic speed - up of quantum search algorithms @xcite .",
    "diffusion is recovered for temporal disorder , while spatial disorder can induce an anderson quantum phase transition to localized wave functions @xcite .",
    "two recent developments have further enriched the phenomenology : one development is the discovery that quantum walks can exhibit a topological phase transition , at which a bound state ( a so - called zero - mode ) appears at a boundary or domain wall @xcite .",
    "a second development involves the introduction of nonlinearities in the dynamics @xcite .",
    "these have been associated with soliton structures @xcite and investigated as a means to speed up the quantum search @xcite . here",
    "we wish to connect these two separate developments , and explore how nonlinearities manifest themselves in a topological quantum walk .",
    "we consider the simplest case of a one - dimensional discrete - time quantum walk in the chiral orthogonal symmetry class ( also known as class bdi , familiar from the su - schrieffer - heeger model @xcite ) .",
    "the topological phase transition manifests itself by the appearance of a pair of zero - modes of opposite chirality .",
    "we demonstrate that these zero - modes may survive in the presence of nonlinearities and moreover acquire a special role as the attractor and repeller of the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we study the one - dimensional dynamics of a two - level system , represented by a spin-@xmath0 degree of freedom on the lattice @xmath1 .",
    "we employ a stroboscopic description , so that time @xmath2 is discretized as well as space .",
    "the linear dynamics is obtained by repeated applications of a unitary operator @xmath3 on a spinor @xmath4 , @xmath5 quite generally , a single time step of such a discrete - time quantum walk can be decomposed into two operations : a rotation @xmath6 of the spinor and a shift @xmath7 to the left or to the right dependent on the spin component : @xmath8 we can combine the two operations as @xmath9 or @xmath10 , but we prefer to take the symmetrized product @xcite , @xmath11    the evolution operator is representative of a chiral orthogonal quantum walk , meaning that @xmath12 is real orthogonal ( particle - hole symmetry ) and@xmath13 ( chiral symmetry ) .",
    "this bdi symmetry class supports a topologically protected zero - mode bound to a domain wall where @xmath14 changes sign .",
    "its time - independent state @xmath15 satisfies @xcite @xmath16 the eigenvalue @xmath17 of the pauli matrix @xmath18 distinguishes the chirality of the zero - mode @xcite .",
    "we now introduce a nonlinearity ( strength @xmath19 ) into the quantum walk by inserting a @xmath4-dependent rotation at each time step ,    [ umtdef ] @xmath20    this nonlinear time - evolution conserves particle - hole symmetry ( a real @xmath4 remains real ) , but chiral symmetry no longer applies .",
    "still , a zero - mode @xmath21 of the linear problem ( @xmath22 ) remains a stationary state when we switch on the nonlinearity , because @xmath23 for any eigenstate of @xmath18 .    to appreciate the new features introduced by the nonlinearity , it is helpful to look at a uniform @xmath24 and a real initial state @xmath25 without any spatial dependence . in one time step the angle @xmath26",
    "is mapped to @xmath27 .",
    "this map is invertible if @xmath28 , but it is not area preserving . the phase space contracts around one of two attractive fixed points , defined by @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "note that this relaxation does not involve any loss of particles : @xmath31 is conserved by the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "as we will now show , for a spatially dependent @xmath14 the zero - mode at a domain wall becomes an attractive or repulsive fixed point , depending on its chirality .",
    "we first present numerical evidence and then give the analytical solution in the continuum limit .",
    "we take a lattice of length @xmath32 with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath33 .",

    "we now perform a linear stability analysis for a real perturbation @xmath56 of the zero - mode .",
    "to linear order in @xmath57 we have @xmath58 we focus on perturbations @xmath59 of the zero - mode with wave number @xmath60 , so we may neglect the spatial dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting ordinary differential equation , @xmath62 has relaxation matrix @xmath63 with eigenvalues @xmath64 given by @xmath65 we conclude that for @xmath66 the zero - mode @xmath54 is an attractor ( @xmath67 ) and @xmath55 is a repeller ( @xmath68 ) , while for @xmath69 the roles are interchanged .",
    "particle - hole symmetry ensures that a real @xmath4 remains real , but we might start with an initially complex state and ask for the stability of the zero - mode under complex perturbations .",
    "substitution into eq .   of @xmath70 , with real @xmath71 , shows that to first order in @xmath72 the nonlinear term contains only the real perturbation : @xmath73    the relaxation matrix for the real perturbation is as in eq .  , with eigenvalues @xmath64 given by eq .  .",
    "but the relaxation matrix for the imaginary perturbation , @xmath74 has purely imaginary eigenvalues , @xmath75 more generally , a perturbation of a complex zero - mode @xmath76 has ( for @xmath66 ) a decaying in - phase component @xmath77 and a non - decaying out - of - phase component @xmath78 [ with real spinors @xmath79 . figs .",

    "the left panel shows a single element of the array , the right panel shows their combination . ]    for the experimental connection , we recall that quantum walks can be realized with true quantum mechanical elements @xcite ( ion traps , cold atoms , quantum dots )  or they can be simulated with classical waves @xcite , as in the optical galton board @xcite .",
    "such a simulated quantum walk combines linear optical elements to mimic the quantum evolution of a spin-@xmath88 degree of freedom .",
    "nonlinearities can be introduced via nonlinear optics @xcite , or while staying within linear optics by introducing a feed - forward element conditioned on the output of a photodetector @xcite .",
    "a scheme of the latter type @xcite is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : galton ] .",
    "this optical galton board simulates a quantum walk with evolution operator @xmath89 , which differs from eqs . and by the order of the operators ( @xmath9 instead of @xmath90 ) .",
    "in the continuum limit of eq . this order is irrelevant , and we have checked numerically that the dynamics is essentially the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : real - init ] .",
    "concerning the generality of the result , we have two necessary conditions for the nonlinearity : it should preserve the zero - mode as a fixed point of the dynamics and it should contract phase space , breaking the area - preservation of the linear dynamics .",
    "both conditions hold if eq .",
    "is replaced by @xmath91 with @xmath92 and two unit vectors @xmath93 and @xmath94 satisfying @xmath95 ( otherwise the map would be area preserving ) . particle - hole symmetry is broken for @xmath96 , but the zero - mode @xmath21 is preserved .",
    "a complex perturbation @xmath43 has relaxation matrix @xmath97 with eigenvalues @xmath98 , @xmath99 , given by eqs .   and , upon the replacement @xmath100 .",
    "the attractor - repeller pair is preserved , demonstrating the generality of our findings .",
    "we finally note that discrete time quantum walks have been used as a design principle for quantum algorithms . for instance , the search algorithms of refs .   can be understood in terms of bound states in effectively one - dimensional quantum walks .",
    "the key observations in this paper , namely the convergence towards certain bound states from arbitrary initial states , as well as the accelerated escape from unwanted bound states , thus may have promising implications for quantum algorithms .",
    "this is in line with several other recent results on continuous time quantum walks , where non - linearities are observed to speed up quantum algorithms @xcite .",
