    "hot subdwarf b ( hereafter : sdb ) stars are horizontal branch stars that consist of a helium rich core surrounded by a thin hydrogen envelope .",
    "the helium core sustains nuclear burning of helium into carbon and oxygen , though in some cases the core may have exhausted helium at the center .",
    "their progenitors are low - mass main sequence stars that are likely to have undergone the core helium flash ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "once hydrogen in the core is exhausted , their progenitors evolve towards the tip of the red giant branch , where they lose all but a tiny fraction of hydrogen during ( or prior to ) the helium flash . those stars that retain less than about 0.001@xmath6 of hydrogen lie on the high @xmath7 end of the horizontal branch .",
    "this small fraction of hydrogen has an influence on the future evolution of sdb stars . as hydrogen shell burning",
    "can not be sustained by the thin hydrogen envelope , the objects will move directly to the white dwarfs cooling track , instead of going through the asymptotic giant branch phase .",
    "several mechanisms for producing this small residual hydrogen envelope that involve single - star or binary evolution have been proposed ; e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hot subdwarfs have representative effective temperatures and surface gravities near 30000  k and @xmath85.5 , respectively . for a general review of their observed properties ,",
    "see @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "with the available sets of frequencies for each star , we can now examine them for the the asymptotic signature of @xmath0-mode pulsations , the coherence of the observed pulsations , and the asteroseismic effects of rotation and binarity . in this section",
    ", we identify the possible signature of rotation ( equally split multiplets ) , and discuss binarity ( low - frequency photometric variation ) and the possible hybrid behaviour of these stars .",
    "we also demonstrate the asymptotic signature of @xmath0-mode pulsation , equal period spacings for consecutive overtones of the same degree @xmath2 , but leave more detailed discussion of this property to a companion paper ( paper viii ) .      for nonradial pulsation in spherically stars , all modes with nonzero values of the azimuthal quantum number @xmath9 have the same frequency as the @xmath9=0 mode .",
    "azimuthal symmetry can be destroyed , lifting the @xmath9 degeneracy , by processes such as rotation or global magnetic fields .",
    "since all stars rotate , we expect to see multiplets in the amplitude spectra , with the splitting within multiplets reflecting the rotation frequency .",
    "if all components of a multiplet are manifest , it will have 2@xmath2 + 1 components .",
    "if the rotation is sufficiently slow ( with a rotation period that is much longer than the oscillation period ) the central frequency ( @xmath9=0 ) will not be affected by rotation while all other components with nonzero @xmath9 values will be shifted by @xmath10 @xcite in the simplest case of solid ",
    "body rotation at a frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the ledoux parameter @xmath12 is an integral quantity that depends on the radial dependence of the oscillation eigenfunctions through the star .",
    "identification of multiplets in the amplitude spectrum can help to derive the rotation period , and is very useful for mode identification .",
    "thus far we detected multiplets in only a few v361hya class stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the very rich amplitude spectrum of v1093her class stars detected with _",
    "kepler _ hold the potential to expose multiplets in these stars . without any obvious evidence of these stars being in close binaries ( with synchronized rotation ) , we do not have any prior expectation of what splittings to look for ( unlike the stars discussed in paper v ) .",
    "therefore , we constrained our search to rotation frequencies that range from the minimum that can be resolved with 30 days of data ( on the slow rotation side ) to rotation periods that would not produce rotational broadening of spectral lines greater than the limits placed via spectroscopy .",
    "we assume that ledoux parameter for @xmath0-modes ( c@xmath13=0.5 , and c@xmath14=0.17  see paper v ) .",
    "these constraints limit us to splittings ranging from 0.825 to 13.5@xmath15hz , which correspond to rotation periods between 7days and 10.3hrs , respectively .",
    "we looked for triplets only , and we assumed that their symmetries can deviate within the formal frequency uncertainty , which is about 0.02@xmath15hz .",
    "we do not find any potential candidates for triplets in kic7668647 or kic8302197 .",
    "there are few possibilities in the other three stars .",
    "kic10001893 shows two triplet candidates .",
    "they are both slightly asymmetrical .",
    "one consists of f@xmath16 , f@xmath17 and f@xmath18 with splittings equal to 5.97 and 5.95@xmath15hz , while the other triplet is formed by f@xmath18 , f@xmath19 and f@xmath20 with splittings equal to 7.30 and 7.33@xmath15hz .",
    "the f@xmath18 peak appears in both triplets , which is clearly inconsistent with a simple rotational splitting interpretation . since the amplitude of the modes in the 5.96@xmath15hz - spaced triplet are significantly larger , we have more confidence that it is a true multiplet .",
    "in kic11558725 we found two other candidates .",
    "these are : f@xmath21 , f@xmath22 and f@xmath23 , having splittings of 7.85 and 7.82@xmath15hz , and f@xmath24 , f@xmath25 and f@xmath26 with splittings equal to 1.12 and 1.11@xmath15hz .",
    "these clearly are not consistent with a uniform rotation period within the star , and even models with differential rotation ( with depth ) rarely show this extreme difference @xcite . for kic10553698 we find a candidate triplet formed by f@xmath18 , f@xmath19 and f@xmath20 , with splittings of 6.17 and 6.19@xmath15hz .",
    "the amplitude spectra surrounding these triplets are presented in fig .",
    "[ triplets ] .",
    "although we found a few candidates for rotationally split triplets , it is hard to explain why only very few modes within a given star are rotationally split .",
    "but there are similarities with other sdbv stars .",
    "for example , @xcite found only two multiplets among more than fifty periodicities in balloon090100001 , and those involved the largest - amplitude modes .",
    "assuming we are seeing real triplets here , a rough estimate of the average rotation period for those three stars is about 20hrs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , among others , argue that approximately half of all sdb stars are members of binary systems .",
    "a signature of binarity can be found in photometric observations ( via eclipses , modulation from reflection off of a low  mass companion , and/or through ellipsoidal variations ) or through radial velocity variations measured via spectroscopy .",
    "many binary sdb stars detected in photometry , e.g. hw vir @xcite , nyvir @xcite having beautiful eclipses features or kpd1930 + 2752 @xcite showing ellipsoidal variation .",
    "recently another binary sdb stars have been found using _ kepler _ data @xcite .",
    "the first describes two pulsating sdb stars that are reflection - effect binaries ; the second is a pulsator in an eclipsing binary .",
    "analysis of the five stars presented here does not reveal any evidence for either the reflection effect or ellipsoidal variation or eclipses .",
    "we note that the de - trending described in sect .",
    "2 might mask some of that evidence , so we also analysed the data prior to de - trending .",
    "while detailed radial velocity time series have not been performed , there is no evidence for composite spectra in these targets .",
    "therefore , we have no evidence of binarity for these stars .",
    "we note that with a longer time baseline , timing variations of the principal pulsation modes can be used to reveal a companion via reflex orbital motion , as was done by @xcite to reveal a planetary companion to v391peg .      as mentioned in sect .",
    "1 , the two classes of pulsating sdb stars overlap in the h  r diagram . on the hotter end , we find @xmath3-mode pulsators ( the v361hya class ) .",
    "typically , these are hotter than @xmath7@xmath2730kk . on the cool side we have @xmath0-mode pulsators ( v1093her ) with typical @xmath7 of about 25kk . in the overlap region",
    ", stars can show both @xmath0-mode and @xmath3-mode pulsations .",
    "since these modes sample different regions of the stars , they are particularly potent targets for asteroseismic investigation . prior to the _ kepler _ discoveries , these stars were relatively rare , with only 5 examples found in ground - based studies . in all of those cases ,",
    "the stronger pulsations are in the @xmath3-mode frequency range .",
    "the lone _ kepler _ @xmath3-mode pulsator had a single low - amplitude oscillation at low frequencies ( paper ii ) , suggesting that it behaves like the already - known hybrid pulsators .",
    "for the _ kepler _ sdbv stars from the first part of the survey , we found that many of the @xmath0-mode pulsators showed suggestive evidence for shorter period pulsations in the @xmath4mode regime ( paper iii ) at lower amplitude .",
    "this pattern is not seen in any of the sdbv pulsators observed using ground - based data .",
    "this is likely a signal - to - noise issue .",
    "the @xmath0-modes are low amplitude to begin with , and at problematic frequencies for adequate ground - based observing ; the possible @xmath3-modes we see are at even lower amplitude .        based on their effective temperatures , almost all the potential _ kepler _ hybrid candidates ( five stars in this paper together with two stars from paper by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have a typical t@xmath28 close to 27kk .",
    "the only exception is the slightly - cooler kic5807616 with only one barely detected peak at high frequencies .",
    "their location in @xmath29 and @xmath7 diagram is right between hybrid stars dominated by @xmath3-modes and v1093her class stars .",
    "this would be consistent with the idea that there is a transition temperature between @xmath3-mode pulsations at the hot end and @xmath0-modes at the cool end ; the @xmath3-mode dominant stars are in general hotter than the _ kepler _ @xmath0-mode dominant hybrids .",
    "if the single high - frequency periodicities are confirmed , this could explain their presence .",
    "the issue of isolated @xmath3-modes is addressed in more detail in one of these stars in the modeling work by @xcite of the star kic2697388 .",
    "their theoretical models suggest that one peak at high frequency is likely intrinsic to the star , despite its low amplitude .",
    "longer coverage should provide a definitive test of the reality of this mode .      while pre - whitening we assumed that each periodicity maintained a fixed frequency , amplitude and phase .",
    "this does not have to be the case , however , since the pulsation can experience amplitude and phase modulation through nonlinear interactions , or growth or decay of mode energy over the course of the run .",
    "changes in amplitude and/or phase can produce a broadening of the peaks in the amplitude spectrum , or produce multiple closely - spaced peaks .",
    "manifestation as multiple peaks could mimic the appearance of multiple ( fully coherent ) pulsation modes , so resolving the amplitude spectrum requires care to distinguish between these possibilities .    for some stars , pre - whitening leaves behind no signals above our noise limits in the residual amplitude spectra .",
    "when no residual signal at the frequency of a removed peak remains , we can be sure that the peak was resolved and the frequency , amplitude , and phase are constant over the course of data run .",
    "looking back at the residual spectra obtained in our analysis we can see that no residual signals remain after pre - whitening the data from kic8302197 and kic10001893 .",
    "removal of the tabulated peaks leaves no significant signal behind .",
    "however , for three stars , residual peaks remain after pre - whitening the dominant periodicities .",
    "their residual spectra contain additional signal at the frequencies of formerly removed peaks .",
    "these may be closely spaced coherent modes , or the effects of amplitude and phase modulation .",
    "for kic7668647 this extra signal remains in four places with relatively small amplitudes .",
    "for two other stars , kic1158725 and kic10553698 , significant peaks do remain after prewhitening .",
    "in the former , there are two strong peaks slightly above 300@xmath15hz while there is one strong residual peak in the latter . in both cases",
    "there are other peaks with smaller significance but still above the detection threshold .",
    "there is a correlation between the amplitude and phase variations that is characteristic of beating between closely - spaced coherent oscillations ( i.e. the phase jumps by @xmath30 during the amplitude minimum in a beat between two equal  amplitude periodicities ) .",
    "if the amplitude and/or phase vary irregularly and with no specific correlations , then that might suggest that the modes are experiencing stochastic changes .",
    "since we have continuous data that span about 30days we can use shorter subsets of the data to look for amplitude and/or phase variations , as was done in paper ii .",
    "to examine the phase and amplitude stability at a given frequency , we first prewhitened by all of the other significant periodicities found for that star .",
    "the prewhitened data were then divided into shorter , equal - length , contiguous runs .",
    "for each of these shorter runs , we fixed the frequency at the best value for the mode in question , and fitted the amplitude and phase . choosing the length of subsets requires balance between time resolution and amplitude and phase uncertainties .",
    "we performed this analysis with different subsets , and found that 2day samples provided the best compromise .",
    "we used non - linear least - squares to fit one sine wave to each individual subset keeping frequency fixed for each peak to determine the pulsation amplitude and phase ( using a fixed but arbitrarily zero point ) .",
    "we repeated this fitting only for four highest residual peaks for each of those three stars .",
    "the result of this analysis is presented in fig.[ampl_ph_7668647]-[ampl_ph_10553698 ] .",
    "[ ampl_ph_7668647 ] shows that the amplitude of this star changes at a significant level for all four tested frequencies . in all of these frequencies",
    ", there is no clear correlation between the amplitude and phase modulations .",
    "for example , there are no abrupt phase jumps in any of the modes tested ; though phase variations occur , they are all much less than one cycle , and they are not correlated with a minimum in pulsation amplitude . thus the variations appear to be caused by random variation in the parameters of this mode .",
    "the variations seen in three of the four modes shine in fig .",
    "[ ampl_ph_11558725 ] appear to be stochastic as well , though in @xmath31 there appears to be a jump in phase around day 167 , when that mode is at minimum amplitude .",
    "the period of this mode is 3250 seconds , and the phase jump is about 1600 seconds  suggesting that there is beating present near this mode .",
    "kic10553698 shows much slower , smoother variations in amplitude and phase in the four modes tested as compared to the other two stars . in most cases ,",
    "there is no correlation between the phase and amplitude variations for a given mode ( i.e. no large phase changes near amplitude minima ) .",
    "but as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ampl_ph_10553698 ] , @xmath32 shows an unusual phase variation near minimum amplitude around day 200 - 205 .",
    "the period of this mode is in excess of 7000 seconds , and the phase increases in that interval by 1500 seconds and then returns to the slower trend .",
    "it is conceivable that the phase jumped by half a cycle ( 3500 seconds ) and that the ( o - c ) curve should lie up near 3500 seconds in this plot if beating is present .",
    "but our best guess is that the phase did not experience that large a change .",
    "it is notable that the slow variation in the amplitude of @xmath33 is reflected in the large residual peak near 200@xmath15hz in the bottom panel of fig.[ft_10553698 ] .",
    "clearly , a longer observing run on this star should aid in determining the true nature of these periodicities .",
    "theoretical consideration of the v1093her class @xcite showed that the pulsation modes detected in these stars correspond to high order @xmath0-modes .",
    "as such , we could invoke asymptotic limit for @xmath34 in which consecutive overtones should be evenly spaced in period .",
    "this behavior has been observed in pulsating white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "because of the low  amplitude signal that is characteristic of these stars , and the logistical challenges of observing these frequencies from a single ground  based observing site , this asymptotic behaviour had not been seen in v1093her stars until space  based observations became available .",
    "the first set of _ kepler _ v1093her stars were found to show clear evidence of equal period spacings , with values of approximately 145 and 250s reported in paper iii and in a later work ( paper viii ) .",
    "the five new detected v1093her class also show evidence of evenly  spaced periods .",
    "for all stars we found average spacing in 250270s range . according to the paper iii , all of the peaks matching this spacing are likely to be @xmath2=1 modes .",
    "there is also evidence of a second series of peaks with spacings in the 140150s range , consistent with them being @xmath2=2 modes .",
    "this simple relation between consecutive overtones provides a determination of the degree @xmath2 of the modes , which will be crucial for interior modeling efforts .",
    "detailed analysis of period spacing on five stars presented here and stars already published in previous papers of our series is a subject of paper viii .",
    "we found five new long - period pulsating sdb ( v1093her ) stars using the _ kepler _ photometer .",
    "the oscillations are mostly in the 100400@xmath15hz region , although we also found some single peaks at higher frequencies .",
    "the nature of those higher - frequency peaks , which are at low amplitude , remain uncertain , and we can not rule out contamination from variable contaminating sources , or unknown spacecraft artefacts . on the other hand , assuming that peaks at high frequencies are indeed @xmath3-modes , the stars match the previously known t@xmath28 - pulsation type correlation .",
    "we believe that more data should confirm or disprove our hypothesis and definitively answer the question about the origin of the peaks .",
    "the amplitudes of detected peaks in the low frequency region are about 1% or less which is in similar to other known v1093her stars .    as we have not found any signatures of binarity we claim that these are single stars .",
    "the pulsation spectra show only limited evidence of rotational splitting , but these occur with low - amplitude periodicities and therefore require continued observation to improve the signal - to - noise and look for other similar spacings in the same stars .",
    "while many of the observed oscillations are coherent , several modes show the signature of possible stochastic amplitude and phase modulation .",
    "this paper completes our initial analysis of the survey phase data on compact stars by _ kepler_. in total we found 12 new members of the v1093her class ( 5 in this paper , 2 in paper v , and 5 in paper iii ) , one v361her star ( paper ii ) and one hybrid star @xcite . among the former two groups , many showing additional peaks in the opposite side of the amplitude spectrum .",
    "our results demonstrate the potential of the _ kepler _ spacecraft for asteroseismology of sdb stars",
    ". continuous coverage and the unprecedented quality of the data allowed us to detect , at high s / n , stellar pulsations in stars which would not be easily studied from the ground .",
    "the rich amplitude spectra of v1093her class stars enables us to use the relation for period spacings to assign most of the detected peaks with @xmath35 ( relative ) and @xmath2 values ( see paper viii ) . with those determinations , along with the frequencies themselves ,",
    "tight constraints can be placed on models of these stars , and therefore will expand our understanding of the formation , structure , and evolution of these highly evolved stars .",
    "we anticipate that with much longer runs of _ kepler _ data we can detect even more peaks with lower amplitudes making period spacing tool even more efficient .",
