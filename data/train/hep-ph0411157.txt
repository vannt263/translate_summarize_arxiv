    "it is well known that external magnetic field is a strong catalyst of dynamical symmetry breaking leading to the generation of dynamical fermion mass even at the weakest attractive interaction between fermions @xcite ( for earlier consideration of dynamical symmetry breaking in a magnetic field , see @xcite ) .",
    "the applications of this effect were considered in condensed matter and cosmology ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the idea of magnetic catalysis was used for explanation of the experimentally observed magnetic field driven metal - dielectric phase transition in pyrolytic graphite @xcite .",
    "as well known , carbon nanotubes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are essentially graphite sheets wrapped on a cylinder . experimentally produced carbon nanotubes have small radii and their long wave length excitations are adequately described by a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional effective quantum field theory whose spatial content is a @xmath1 space because only the lowest mode for fermions on the circle is retained .",
    "nonetheless , the cylinder geometry of carbon nanotubes presents an interesting setup from the viewpoint of dynamical symmetry breaking in external constant magnetic field in a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime with nontrivial topology .",
    "we study this problem in the present paper .",
    "it is clear that two directions of magnetic field are distinguished .",
    "the first one is when magnetic field is perpendicular to the axis of cylinder and the second when it is parallel .",
    "obviously , since the normal projection of magnetic field varies with angle , the first case presents an inhomogeneous problem whose solution is difficult to find .",
    "the case where magnetic field is parallel to the axis of cylinder is much more tractable and was already studied in some detail in @xcite .",
    "classically , magnetic field parallel to the axis of cylinder does not affect at all the motion of charged particles on the surface of cylinder . however , this is not true in quantum mechanics where the presence of magnetic field leads to the appearance of the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase @xcite .",
    "we would like to add also that , in general , one can relax the requirement that external magnetic field is constant .",
    "it is enough to require only that the normal component of magnetic field be equal to zero on the surface of cylinder .",
    "magnetic field through the transverse section of cylinder can be arbitrary and what matters is only the total magnetic field flux through the transverse section of cylinder .    to study dynamical symmetry breaking on a cylinder in parallel magnetic field",
    ", we consider the following gross - neveu type model @xcite with @xmath2 flavors : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath2 the number of flavors .",
    "according to @xcite , we consider the four - component spinors corresponding to a four - dimensional ( reducible ) representation of diracs matrices @xmath6 the lagrangian ( [ w0 ] ) is invariant under the discrete transformation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 obviously , the mass term breaks this symmetry since @xmath9 we consider the model with breaking of discrete symmetry in order to avoid strong quantum fluctuations due to massless nambu ",
    "goldstone fields which , if present , would destroy the mean - field solution that we find .",
    "introducing an auxiliary @xmath10 field , the lagrangian ( [ w0 ] ) can be equivalently represented in the following way :    @xmath11    integrating over the fermion fields , we obtain the following effective action for the @xmath10 field in the @xmath12 approximation : @xmath13 if we choose the @xmath14 axis along the axis of cylinder and the @xmath15 axis along the circumference , then , mathematically , cylinder is a @xmath16 space or compactified plane in the @xmath15 direction , i.e. @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the radius of cylinder .",
    "obviously , @xmath16 is a multiply - connected space and , according to hosotani @xcite , the nonzero component @xmath19 of gauge field can not be gauged away unlike the case of a simply connected space .",
    "equivalently , if we consider our space @xmath16 as a real cylinder in embedding 3d space , then the constant @xmath19 component is related to the flux of constant magnetic field @xmath20 through the transverse section of cylinder @xcite .",
    "further , @xmath21 and , consequently , the effective potential is equal to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is greens function which satisfies the following equation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 . obviously , in euclidean space , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the elementary magnetic field flux .",
    "since the sum in ( [ w3 ] ) is over all integer @xmath30 , it suffices to consider @xmath31 on the interval @xmath32 $ ] . to evaluate the sum in ( [ w3 ] )",
    ", we transform it into an integral in complex plane @xmath33 @xmath34 where the contour @xmath35 runs around poles of the function @xmath36",
    ". then we can deform contour and present the last integral as sum over two residues at @xmath37 . as result , we have @xmath38 @xmath39 finally , the effective potential is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is cut - off .",
    "the gap equation which follows from @xmath42 is @xmath43 consequently , the nontrivial solution for @xmath44 is @xmath45 which obviously decreases with @xmath31 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we would like to note that our effective potential and the solution of gap equation agree with the corresponding results obtained in @xcite . by using ( [ potential ] ) , it is not difficult to show that the nontrivial solution always has lower energy than the trivial solution @xmath46 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath31 .",
    "this result corresponds to an unusual situation where external constant magnetic field inhibits rather than assists dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "according to @xcite , constant magnetic field in infinite flat space leads to dimensional reduction by two units @xmath47 in the infrared region for fermions that strongly assists dynamical symmetry breaking . magnetic field in our case",
    "does not influence the spatial motion of fermions at all , therefore , the dimensional reduction is absent . the only dynamical effect that magnetic field",
    "has in our case is through the appearence of the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase .",
    "since this phase increases energy of fermions , we obtain that magnetic field in our case counteracts dynamical symmetry breaking unlike all other known cases .",
    "remarkably , this result is consistent with a more general idea that external magnetic field enhances the fermion gap in the spectrum .",
    "the point is that there is an additional purely kinematic contribution @xmath48 ( see ( [ w3 ] ) ) due to the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase to the total fermion gap and as we show below the total gap @xmath49 increases with @xmath31 . to prove this ,",
    "let us consider the function @xmath50 where @xmath51 takes values on the interval @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 , otherwise , the gap equation ( [ w4 ] ) does not have a nontrivial solution .",
    "the derivative of this function with respect to @xmath14 is equal to @xmath54 further , taking into account that @xmath55 we find that this derivative is positive @xmath56 thus , although the dynamically generated fermion mass decreases with @xmath31 , the total fermion gap increases with @xmath31 .",
    "graphically , the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath31 is depicted in fig.2 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath31 .",
    "finally , let us find the critical coupling constant that separates the symmetrical phase from the phase with broken symmetry . as follows from ( [ solution ] ) , the critical coupling constant is @xmath58}\\ , .",
    "\\label{critical}\\ ] ] once again we see that external magnetic field counteracts dynamical symmetry breaking since as follows from ( [ critical ] ) the critical coupling constant increases with @xmath31 that means that we need stronger attraction in order to break symmetry . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the critical coupling constant goes to zero @xmath60 , i.e. symmetry is always broken in this case.by using ( [ solution ] ) one can show that the phase transition with respect to the magnetic field flux is the mean field second order phase transition .",
    "in this paper we have investigated dynamical symmetry breaking on a cylinder in external magnetic field parallel to the axis of cylinder .",
    "this problem may be relevant for certain condensed matter systems .",
    "in fact , we were inspired by the geometry of carbon nanotubes .",
    "on the other hand , our problem can be considered as the problem of dynamical symmetry breaking in a multiply - connected space , where gauge field has a nonzero constant vacuum expectation value @xcite , which can not be gauged away unlike the case of a simply connected space .    by studying a relatively simple gross  neveu type model on a cylinder in external magnetic field",
    ", we find that unlike all other known cases external magnetic field counteracts the generation of dynamical fermion mass , i.e. larger magnetic fields correspond to smaller dynamical fermion masses .",
    "there exists also an additional purely kinematic contribution to the fermion gap in this problem , which increases with magnetic field .",
    "remarkably , we find that the total fermion gap , which includes both the dynamical and kinematical contributions , always increases with magnetic field irrespectively the values of coupling constant and the radius of cylinder . thus , although our analysis shows that external magnetic field in spaces with nontrivial topology does not always assist dynamical symmetry breaking unlike the case of flat spaces with trivial topology @xcite , our results are consistent with a more general idea that external magnetic field increases the fermion gap in the spectrum .",
    "we would like to note that one can gauge away the vector potential in our problem but in this case the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase will reveal itself in the boundary conditions for fermions on the circle .",
    "the cases of periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions for fermion fields were considered in @xcite , where dynamical chiral symmetry breaking was studied in a spacetime @xmath61 in external magnetic field .",
    "it is clear that the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase defines arbitrary boundary conditions for fermions on the circle and allows to interpolate smoothly between the periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is easy to check that our results on dynamical symmetry breaking are consistent with the results of @xcite ( as well as @xcite ) , where it was found that although for periodic boundary conditions ( when the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase is zero in our setup ) a dynamical mass is generated at the weakest attractive interaction between fermions , the effect of antiperiodic boundary conditions ( when the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase attains its maximal possible value ) is to counteract the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . since magnetic field considered in @xcite is perpendicular to the spatial plane , unlike our case it can not influence boundary conditions for fermions on the circle .",
    "the paper @xcite studied dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in qed in a spacetime with the topology @xmath62 without external magnetic field . in this case",
    "the aharonov - bohm phase for fermions appears due to nonzero constant vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic vector potential that can not be gauged away in a multiply - connected spacetime .",
    "the aharonov - bohm phase in this problem is not an external parameter like in our problem but a dynamical variable that should be determined from the requirement of the minimum of energy .",
    "interestingly , it was found in @xcite that the state with the lowest energy corresponds to fermions with antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "this disfavors dynamical fermion mass generation , however , according to the results of our paper , the total fermion gap which includes also the purely kinematic contribution due to the aharonov - bohm phase is still larger than the gap in the case of zero aharonov - bohm phase .    finally , we would like to note that a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional free fermion model was investigated in @xcite , where a nonzero chiral symmetry breaking condensate was found due to the aharonov  bohm phase related to the singular magnetic vortex . in our opinion , it would be very interesting to study dynamical symmetry breaking in this model by adding some interaction .",
    "unfortunately , unlike the problem that we investigated in this paper the problem considered in @xcite is inhomogeneous and such a study would be very difficult to perform .",
