    "the hubbard type of models in the theory of strongly correlated electron systems are notably successful @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is remarkable the way they reproduce the properties of mott insulators , such as metal - transitions oxides and copper - oxygen layered htc compounds @xcite .",
    "however , the efforts for developing approaches having more basic foundations had not ceased , due to the expectation that they could open the way for obtaining more exact and specific results@xcite . in this sense ,",
    "methods that are grouped into the so called band theory picture are also known as first principle calculations in the literature .",
    "they are electronic structure calculations that begin with the interactions among electrons or atoms in vacuum .",
    "the study of the band structure they predict , in principle should offer a road toward the effective and precise determination of the physical properties of each material@xcite .",
    "some of them are : the configurations interaction scheme ( ci ) ; the local density approximations method ( lda)@xcite , the local spin density approximations procedure ( lsda ) and hartree - fock method ( hf ) . however , the above mentioned potentialities of those first principles approaches had been failing in describing many of so called strongly correlated electron system@xcite .",
    "for example , the lsda , a sophisticated generalization of the lda procedure , was devised to describe local spin structures@xcite . however , although the method had offered satisfactory descriptions of the physical results in few materials , this success had not been universal and it also wrongly predicted the properties of some compounds , by example , the here considered la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 .",
    "the motivation of the present work arose from a primary suspicion that perhaps the self - consistent hartree fock ( hf ) method , could had been underestimated in its possibilities for helping in the above described searches@xcite . in this sense",
    ", it can be firstly remarked that it is widespread the criteria that for obtaining behaviors such as the mott insulator character , it becomes necessary the presence of short range correlations among electrons with spin quantized in different directions . by example , paraphrasing one type of mott s argument for specific systems : `` ... two electrons with spin resting on contrary directions are forbidden to occupy the same wannier orbital ... '' . on another hand , the orthodox hf approaches does not have in consideration the correlations among electrons of different spins .",
    "therefore two electrons with opposite spins do not disturb one each other and consequently both of them can occupy the same wannier orbital .",
    "clearly , the usual hf approach , seems not to be viable for investigating a system in which the mott s argument is appropriate .",
    "however , the physical sources of the validity of cited mott s statement in some systems are not completely clear . by example : which is the physical origin of these short range correlations assumed in it ? .",
    "even , the proper concept of correlations , roughly described as :  everything missing in the single - particle hf state for to be the real many body ground state  , makes clear how clouded their origins are . as the result of the study presented here ,",
    "we believe that many of the so called correlation effects , can be effectively described even in the framework of the hf scheme , after removing certain symmetry restrictions which obstacle the finding of the best hf solutions .",
    "such constraints are usually imposed on the space formed by the single particle orbitals , which are employed to construct the determinant like states among which the hf one shows minimal energy . by example , if after solving the hf problem , it occurs that the resulting self - consistent potential breaks the symmetry of the original crystalline lattice , it could create a gap and thus produce a mott kind of insulating solution .",
    "this effect was originally discovered by slater in ref . .",
    "this symmetry breaking effect has been also more recently underlined and deepened in ref . .",
    "however , the removal of this kind of symmetry restrictions alone had not been able to describe the insulator properties of a large class of materials@xcite .",
    "one of the central results of the present investigation , as it will be described just in what follows , is the identification of another important kind of symmetry restrictions that seemingly had been overlooked for long time .",
    "it can be cited here that a fully unrestricted formulation of the hf problem was early done by dirac in ref . .",
    "this work will consider the hartree - fock self - consistent problem as applied to a simple one band model of the la@xmath5cuo@xmath6@xcite , but following an unusual way . in order to leave freedom to obtain paramagnetic , ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic solutions in the same context",
    ", we look for single particle orbitals being non separable in their spacial and spinor dependence , i.e. they will have the structure @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , in those states there is no an absolute common quantization direction for the electron spin .",
    "thus , in each position the spin is quantized in a specific direction , and the equations of motion to be used will reflect this fact .",
    "note , that to proceed in this way is not other thing that to apply the dirac s unrestricted formulation of the hf procedure@xcite .",
    "we think that the restriction to @xmath8 and @xmath3 types of orbitals , usually employed in hf electronic band and quantum chemistry calculations , prohibits from the start the prediction of possible spontaneously symmetry breaking effects @xcite .",
    "such a particular structure , excessively reduces the space of functions to be examined and consequently annihilates some possibilities to obtain exotic solutions ( like that ones that are present in the strong correlation effects ) .",
    "we believe that in the context of the band theory , or more precisely , under the hf approach , it could be possible to reproduce the main characteristics of a wide class of _ mott insulator _ kind of materials .",
    "the results of the simple model investigated here , as it will be seen , support this possibility for important compounds such as la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 , which under certain doping levels turn out in high temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "the present work heads in that direction , with eyes in also showing the potentialities of implementing the above considerations in self - consistent hf calculations , not only for describing electronic bands and the associated ground states , but also for studying atomic and molecular structures .",
    "the exposition proceeds as follows . in the section [ chap:2 ]",
    "we describe the details of the hf self - consistent method to be employed in next sections .",
    "specifically , it will be discussed the imposition of restrictions on the space of single particle states in which the solutions will be searched and the possible physical consequences they could carry on . in section [ chap:3 ] the effective model we are going to employ will be exposed . the symmetry restrictions to be assumed and its corresponding tight - binding bloch basis will be defined .",
    "section [ chap:4 ] is devoted to derive the hf equations associated to interacting electrons which free hamiltonian is given by the specially constructed effective tight binding model .",
    "the tight binding bloch basis associated to the model is chosen in this section to have the maximal symmetry given by the group of translations leaving invariant the copper - oxygen plane in la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 .",
    "considering the previously mentioned paramagnetic solution in a generic form , the free parameters of the effective hamiltonian are adjusted to reproduce the form of the only half filled band in the matheiss calculation of the band structure of la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "after defined the free hamiltonian of the model , the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic solutions are obtained . the bloch basis shown in section [ chap:3 ]",
    "was employed .",
    "both solutions are also compared in this section and the properties of all the obtained states are analyzed in corresponding subsections .",
    "appendix [ aelem ] presents notations , algebraic developments , constants and definitions cited along the writing . in a final seccin the main conclusions of the work are reviewed and various further tasks for its extension are described .",
    "in the language of quantum mechanic the state of a system of n particles is described by a function depending on each one particle s spinor and spacial coordinates @xmath9 , where @xmath10 represents the corresponding set of quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the hf approximation consists on supposing that the above mentioned state can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath11-products of orthonormalized orbitals @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "each one of these orbitals is interpreted as a single particle state , because it defines amplitude and probability distributions depending on a single particle coordinates . as usual , in what follows the word coordinates will mean the spacial as well as the spinor ones .",
    "if the particles are fermions , the previously mentioned linear combination is called slater determinant @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 be the n - electrons system hamiltonian , including kinetic plus interaction with the environment hamiltonian @xmath15 , besides coulomb interaction among pairs of electrons @xmath16 .",
    "the hf equations of motion for this system , leading the dynamic of the single particle states in a self - consistent way , are    @xmath17\\ \\phi_{\\eta}(x , s)&\\\\ \\nonumber-\\sum_{\\eta_1}[\\ \\sum_{s^{\\prime}}\\int d^2x^{\\prime } \\phi^*_{\\eta_1}(x^{\\prime},s^{\\prime } ) v(x , x^{\\prime } ) \\phi_{\\eta}(x^{\\prime},s^{\\prime})\\ ] \\phi_{\\eta_1}(x , s)&=\\varepsilon_{\\eta}\\ \\phi_{\\eta}(x , s),\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is a label in the basis formed by the solutions .",
    "that is , each hf electron state is influenced by the presence of the other ones .",
    "the self - consistent hamiltonian has two components , the coulomb like type of mean potential which their fellows create : the direct potential and the contribution reflecting the fact that two electrons can not occupy the same state : the exchange potential @xcite .    the hf energy of the @xmath11 electrons system and the interaction energy of an electron in the @xmath19 state with the remaining ones , are given by    @xmath20    the bracket notation definition is given in appendix [ aelem ] within the subsection [ sub : brac ] .",
    "it can be noted that the system of equations ( [ hf ] ) is rotational invariant because it is written without imposing a spatially absolute direction for the spin quantization of the single electron orbitals .",
    "this rotational invariant formulation of the self - consistent hf procedure was firstly introduced by dirac in ref . .",
    "to solve ( [ hf ] ) is a complicated task because it is a system of coupled integro - differential equations .",
    "the iterative method is one of the most frequently employed for solving this kind of systems and it is usually complemented by the imposition of symmetry restrictions that simplify the space of states to be investigated . however , the use of such constraints could avoid the obtaining of special solutions non obeying the added symmetry conditions .",
    "although in some cases they could retain the minimal energy one , the method can hide the existence of interesting excited states and inclusive could wrongly predict the excitation features in some cases , as it will be seen in what follows .",
    "a very common symmetry restriction usually employed in band theory and quantum chemistry calculations is to consider that single particle solutions of ( [ hf ] ) have spin quantized in a given direction in every point of the space @xcite .",
    "that is @xmath21 where @xmath22 represent the pauli spinors with spin up and down in a certain direction respectively .",
    "if the spacial functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the same , the hf calculation is called a restricted one , if they are different , the procedure is called unrestricted @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the consequences of considering the possibly existence of non separable single particle states being solutions of the hf problem .",
    "a positive answer to this question can open a natural context for obtaining solutions exhibiting magnetic properties and to allow their comparison with paramagnetic ones .",
    "another important kind of restrictions posed on the first principles band theory evaluations is the a priori impositions of crystal symmetries . to beforehand impose a symmetry on the assumed to be searched solution , although it could be well rooted in the studied system , has the risk of hiding a possible spontaneous breaking of that invariance .",
    "this could occurs due to the reduction of the space orbitals in which we are searching . in that case",
    "it can turns out that the obtained solutions will not be an absolute extremal of the energy functional , but a conditional one , due to the fixed symmetry constraint .",
    "for instance , let us consider the functional space formed by the allowed orbitals and the maximal subset of orbitals u which is invariant under a certain group of transformations * t*. consider also the maximal subset u@xmath25 being invariant under the group of transformations * * t**@xmath26 which is a subgroup of * t*. then , the set u@xmath26 obtained from imposing less symmetry restrictions a priori , should contain the set u. therefore , after to find the extremes of the same functional in u and u@xmath26 , it could be possible to obtain different results . in this case , the solution in u@xmath26 , in general , shall be the most stable of both .",
    "however , also it could be the case that looking for a solution in u@xmath25 , an extremal function also pertaining to u arises as a solution .",
    "in such a situation , such a configuration could be found from the beginning by finding the extreme of the functional in u , that is , by imposing more symmetry restrictions . in terms of the hf scheme",
    ", this could mean that the states corresponding to both solutions have identical occupied single - particle states , but they curiously might show different sets of excited ones .",
    "therefore , depending on the particular features of the material , removing a priori imposed symmetry restrictions on the set of allowed orbitals of the hf procedure , can predict new properties for the excited single particle states of the system .",
    "such one could be for instance the gap appearance .",
    "this effect can have physical relevance after noting that at finite temperatures the more stable state will be preferred by the system and then the state showing a gap should be expected to be selected at non zero temperature .",
    "in this section the basis of the effective band model used to describe the dynamic of the less bounded la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 electrons will be presented .",
    "the main considerations for defining the model and the determination of its characteristic parameters are given .",
    "in subsection [ cuo ] the simplified electronic model for the copper - oxygen planes , as well the main definitions in its structure are introduced .",
    "subsections [ sec : traslacionessr ] and [ tb ] are devoted to define the symmetry transformation group defining the tight binding bloch basis .",
    "it is known that at low temperature la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 is an antiferromagnetic - insulator @xcite . however , in evident contradiction with the experiments the linear augmented plane waves ( lapw ) technics @xcite predicts a metal and paramagnetic zero temperature properties for this material .",
    "nevertheless , such band calculation results show that the conduction electrons are strongly coupled to the bravais lattice centers of the copper oxygen planes .",
    "clearly this tight - binding behavior is determined by the interaction of the electrons with its surrounding effective environment .",
    "this defines the initial hypothesis of our model .",
    "the less bounded electron in the la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 molecule is the cu@xmath27 s not paired one . that is , at difference from o@xmath28 ions , cu ones do not have their last shell ( 3d ) closed .",
    "those copper 3d electrons fill the last band of la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 solid and in what follows they shall be referred as : the electron gas .",
    "it seems appropriate to consider those electrons as strongly linked to cuo@xmath0 cells and moreover , given the above mentioned arguments , with special preference for the cu centers @xcite .",
    "thus , our bravais lattice is going to be the squared net coincident with the array of copper sites ( see the figure [ f : bravais ] ) .",
    "the presence of electrons pertaining to the various fully filled bands in the material plus the nuclear charges , plays a double role in the model .",
    "firstly , it will act as an effective polarizable environment , which screens the field created by electron charges constituting the electron gas in the half filled band . consequently",
    ", we will introduce a dielectric constant @xmath29 which will screen the coulomb interaction . secondly , as suggested by its spacial distribution and magnitude , the mean field created by the environment will be assumed to act as a periodic potential w@xmath30 being responsible for tight - binding confining of the electron to the cu centers .",
    "it is also primordial in the model to take into consideration the interaction f@xmath31 among the electron gas and the  jellium  neutralizing its charges .",
    "this background will be modeled here as a gaussian distribution of positive charges @xmath32 surrounding each lattice point and with characteristic radius _ b _ .    in resume",
    ", the free hamiltonian of the model takes the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the i - th electron s squared momentum operator ; _ m _ is the electron mass ; @xmath35 is the vacuum permitivity and @xmath36 moves on bravais lattice .",
    "the versors @xmath37 and @xmath38 are resting on the direction defined by the lattice s nearest neighbours , see figure [ f : bravais ] a ) .",
    "it is known that the distance between cu nearest neighbours is p@xmath39 3.8 @xcite .",
    "we also consider the interaction among pairs of electrons in the form @xmath40 which , as remarked above , includes a dielectric constant associated to the presence of the effective environment .",
    "we are seeking here for hf solutions with orbitals having a non separable spin and orbit structures .",
    "thus , it was considered that the spin can show a different projection for the different wannier wavepackets to be superposed in defining those orbitals .",
    "the spin for each of them will be either or @xmath2 or @xmath3 type , according they are linked either to one or the other of the two sublattices shown in figure [ f : bravais ] a ) .",
    "thus , the single particle eigenstates will be chosen to be invariant , only under the reduced group of translations which transform each of those sublattices on itself .",
    "it is important employ a procedure leaving independently identified the characteristics of the electron states in each one of the sublattices . that will allow to analyze solutions with dissimilar qualities in a same framework , that is : antiferromagnetic * afm * , paramagnetic * pm * and ferromagnetic * fm * ones",
    "for this purpose , let us define the points of the two sublattices with indices r = 1 , 2 , as follows @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 form the basis versors on each one of them .",
    "the solutions we are looking for will be eigenfunctions of the operators @xmath44 belonging to the reduced discrete translation group which transforms a given sublattice on itself : @xmath45    if the bravais lattice were infinite , the brillouin s zone ( b.z . )",
    "associated to @xmath44 would be the shadowed one on figure [ f : zb ] a ) .",
    "note , that the continent square in this figure represents the b.z .",
    "associated to the group of translations which leaves invariant the absolute lattice ( the lattice formed by the cu atoms in the cuo planes ) . however , given the impossibility of considering an infinite lattice for numerically solving the hf problem , then is also not allowed to consider its associated b.z . as continuous .",
    "therefore we will impose periodic boundary conditions on the @xmath46 in the absolute lattice s boundaries x@xmath47= -l p y l p , x@xmath0= -l p y l p ( see figure [ f : zb ] b ) ) .",
    "this condition determines the allowed set of * k * @xmath48    therefore , after recalling the discussion given in the introduction , note that we are now demanding less crystal symmetry on the single particle states which we are looking for , since a lower number of constraints are being imposed on the space of single particle states in which the solutions are searched .",

    "note , that due to the tiny overlapping among nearest neighbors approximation , the exact orthogonal character is only weakly lost between elements corresponding to different sublattices and having the same spin quantization .",
    "that occurs because nearest neighbors belong to different arrays",
    ". however the orthogonality between different elements corresponding to the same sublattice , as well as unity norm for every elements , is rigourously maintained .",
    "this follows because they are constructed as bloch states in their corresponding sublattices .",
    "the wannier orbitals @xmath55 represent the probability amplitude of encountering one electron in the vicinity of the site @xmath56 , that is on the given cell cuo@xmath0 .",
    "let us now describe some simplifications that will be adopted in order to solve the hf problem .",
    "the central aim of this work is not to make an exact study of the problem , instead we seek for approximate solutions qualitatively well reflecting the physical properties of la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 and other compounds . following this principle",
    "we take for the wannier orbitals the explicit form given in ( [ base de bloch ] ) . physically",
    ", this means to consider the effective potential created by the environment on each electron of the half filled band , is a quadratic function having a minimum on the copper sites and strongly confining the electrons to it .",
    "this last consideration is similar to the one made on the _ t - j _ one band model .",
    "in this section the main results of this work and their discussion are presented . in subsection [ secc:41 ] the equivalent matrix problem , resulting from projecting the hf system of equations ( [ hf ] ) on the tight binding bloch basis ( [ base de bloch ] ) defined in the previous section is presented .",
    "subsection [ smst ] shows how after imposing the maximal translational symmetry and an @xmath2 and @xmath3 spin nature on the orbitals , the model is able to reproduce the dispersion relation of la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 metal - paramagnetic half filled band of the precise band calculations given in ref . .",
    "the solutions presented in subsections [ solantiferro ] and [ solpara ] , illustrate the consequences of releasing symmetry restrictions on the space in which hf solutions are searched .",
    "the first of them corresponds to a mott s insulator - antiferromagnetic ground state .",
    "that is , the state corresponds to an insulator even tough it has one electron per cell , precisely in the same way as la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 behaves .",

[ cols=\">,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is an interesting outcome that the energy difference pm ( ppg)-iaf and the nel temperature of this kind of materials are both of the order of 10@xmath120 k. thus , the results suggest the possibility of having further success in applying the approach started in this work to the description of some regions of the phase diagram of the la@xmath0 cuo@xmath6 . on the question about the relative stability between the pm and ppg states , it can be estimated that due to the presence of a pseudogap , the ppg ground state should become more stable than the pm at non vanishing temperatures .",
    "this should be the case because for creating excitations on the ppg ground state , temperatures of hundreds of kelvin degrees are needed , while excitations in the pm ground state can occur in every range of temperatures .",
    "[ f : bandas2 ]     in figure [ f : bandas2 ] the ppg ( pm ) and iaf occupied bands are depicted in a common frame .",
    "the main difference in their energies corresponds to the single particle states being closer to fermi surface .",

    "therefore , it can be hoped that from the solution of ( [ ecumatricial2 ] ) under doping with holes , both solutions move toward a common ground state without absolute magnetic order , in correspondence with the pattern shown by the phase diagrams of these materials @xcite .",
    "that is , at a critical doping level value a breaking of the antiferromagnetic order could occur and the system presumably transits to a phase showing a pseudogap .",
    "the results of this work support the potential of the hf self - consistent method for the description of some secular properties exhibited by materials such as copper - oxygen compounds , specifically la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 .",
    "those are properties usually associated to strong correlation effects , that could be explained by _",
    "first principle _ calculations , after modified to incorporate procedures to search for spontaneous symmetry breaking solutions and general ways of exploring the spin structure of the hf obitals .",
    "note that single particle orbitals are not only employed in the hf method .",
    "they are also essential ingredients of more general schemes as the various types of density functional methods .",

    ", it was necessary to utilize a simple model which was sufficiently flexible for reproducing the dispersion profile of the only half filled band of la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 reported in ref . .",
    "after imposing the maximal symmetry under translations a paramagnetic and metallic ground state ( pm ) was obtained which dispersion properties topologically also coincide with the results given in ref . .",
    "then , the free parameters of effective model were fixed from the requirement of reproducing the bandwidth of the half filled band obtained in ref . .",
    "employing those parameters and from removing some symmetry restrictions , solutions were obtained which show interesting properties . in agreement with the experiment , the insulating - antiferromagnetic ( iaf ) solution turns to be the most stable among all hf states found .",
    "some of its properties are enumerated below :    1 .",
    "the gap magnitude diminish with the increasing of the screening constant @xmath29 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic structure the hf orbitals increases when the states approach the fermi level .",
    "in addition , the size of the outlying region in which antiferromagnetism persists depends on the screening created by the effective environment @xmath29 .",
    "that is , by increasing screening , the size of the antiferromagnetic region reduces .",
    "thus , the idea arises that after doping with holes ( that is , solving for hf solutions not at half filling condition as it is done here ) the antiferromagnetic zone , which is precisely concentrated near the fermi level could be annihilated , producing in this way a phase transition to a non magnetically ordered ground state .",
    "this possibility indicates a way to describe the normal state properties of the htc superconductors through a simple hf study .",
    "the magnetic moments per cell which are evaluated rest on the right direction respect to the lattice and its modular value of 0.67 @xmath4 satisfactorily coincides with the experimentally measured result 0.68 @xmath4 .",
    "this outcome support the adjust made of the parameters defining the effective model employed .    the other hf solution presented in this work corresponds to a paramagnetic state showing a pseudogap ( ppg ) .",
    "few properties of this state are described in what follows :    1 .",
    "the pseudogap magnitude diminishes with the increasing of the screening constant @xmath29 .",
    "2 .   just as we hoped from the beginning of the work , at zero temperature the states pm and ppg resulted identical .",
    "the difference between them is only given by the excitations of the system .",
    "thus , the removal of some symmetry restrictions , defines in this case , new properties for unoccupied single particle states .",
    "it seems feasible that in other materials , it could be possible to obtain a gap instead of a pseudogap even in the absence of magnetic order .",
    "such an outcome could show the ability of a properly formulated hf description in describing all the kinds of mott insulators , being or not magnetically ordered .",
    "the amplitude of the obtained pseudogap reaches a value of the order of 10@xmath120k .",
    "thus , it is possible that the system at finite temperature should prefer the ppg state over the pm one . that is an interesting signal , knowing that la@xmath121m@xmath122cuo@xmath6 presents pseudogap in the * pm * phase .",
    "4 .   in the same way as it happens for the antiferromagnetic character of the iaf ground state , the difference between the one particle energies of iaf and the ppg ( pm ) states , is greater for states being closer to the fermi surface .",
    "that is , it happens for the electrons with more energy and consequently the first ones in disappear under doping with holes .",
    "therefore , as it was mentioned before , these results suggest the possibility to describe a transition iaf@xmath123ppg under doping with holes , within the here studied effective model .    one methodological conclusion of this work seems to be worth to be mention .",
    "it corresponds to the fact that the results fully clarifies that the solutions of a general hf problem non necessarily should turn to be a set of single particle orbitals , all having an @xmath2 or @xmath124 spin structure at all points of the space .",
    "this is directly shown by the particular example of the iaf solution in which the hf single particle states have a neatly non separable character in their spin and orbital dependence .",
    "this possibility , although being simple , and perhaps even expected to be correct after to direct the attention to it , looks to be relevant for the description of magnetic and strongly correlated systems .",
    "the above enumerated conclusions motivated new objectives to be considered in extending the work .",
    "our general interests are twofold : in one side to achieve a more complete and precise investigation about the here detected unexplored potentialities of the _ first principle _ calculations . in another direction , to look for the possibility of describing the htc superconductivity in the framework of the here studied simple model .",
    "some of the more specific issues of future searches in connection those general objectives are the following ones :    * to generalize the discussion done in this work to introduce the doping with holes as a new parameter .",
    "then , it will be possible to investigate the effects of the doping on the here determined ground states .",
    "of particular relevance in this sense appears the iaf state . * to compute the zero temperature electron green function of the system , and use it to evaluate the effective polarization of the la@xmath0cuo@xmath6 in the obtained states . * with the polarization results at hand , attempt to solve the bethe - salpeter equation for two holes in the iaf ground state ( and also in the ppg one ) , to find whether it is possible or not to define the existence of preformed cooper pairs in the model .",
    "the possibility for its existence was suggested by the results of ref . ,",
    "in which it was argued that a strong 2d - screening of the coulomb interaction is created by a half filled band of tight binding electron . * to continue the application of the ideas advanced here in help clarifying the widely known debate between the mott and slater pictures about the electronic structure of solids . * to apply a rotational invariant hf calculation for obtaining states of molecular or atomic systems having incomplete shells .",
    "we guess , that this application could help to reduce the value of the correlation energies in those systems .",
    "this idea is suggested by the results of this work which show that the hf energy can be optimized in many of the currently considered physical systems , due to the difficulties in determining the best among all possible self - consistent solutions .",

    "<S> it turns out that the most stable hf solution of the problem corresponds to an antiferromagnetic and insulating state ( iaf ) , which magnetization rests on the experimentally determined direction . </S>",
    "<S> encouragingly , the evaluated magnetic moment per cell is 0.67 @xmath4 , a result that satisfactorily reproduces the experimentally measured value : 0.68 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> another hf solution having a slightly higher energy arises and corresponds to a paramagnetic state showing a pseudogap ( ppg ) . </S>",
    "<S> it follows after only imposing the bloch stucture on the single particle states . </S>",
    "<S> finally a third paramagnetic but metallic solution ( no gap ) is also obtained by including both of the mentioned restrictions . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting result follows that this state only differs from the ppg pseudogap state in the form of excited empty orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the occupied single particle states and the hf energy at t = 0 for both solutions , are identical . in general , the discussion helps to clarify the role of the antiferromagnetic correlations in the structure of the physics of the htsc materials . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , these initial results , indicate a promising way for start conciliating the mott and slater pictures in the physics of the strongly correlated electron systems . </S>"
