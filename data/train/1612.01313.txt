    "intensity modulation with direct detection ( im / dd ) is one of the most prevalent methods to communicate through optical channels and networks due to its simplicity in design and implementation . in these channels ,",
    "information is modulated onto intensity domain and thus , all symbols have non - negative values . to find the capacity of such channels , first one",
    "should obtain the statistical expression of the channel .",
    "there has already been presented several channel statistics model for im / dd channels such as poisson and gaussian intensity channels and also the capacity of these channels are investigated . in [ 1]-[5 ] ,",
    "upper and lower bound for discrete - time poisson channel are proposed under different conditions .",
    "upper and lower bounds for the capacity of the guassian optical intensity channels are also evaluated in [ 6]-[10 ] using various methods such as sphere packing , duality approach and maxentropic method .",
    "moser presents the capacity results of optical intensity channels with input - dependent gaussian noise under peak and average power conditions [ 11 ] .    in this paper , laguerre behavior",
    "is considered as the conditional statistics of the channel .",
    "discrete - time laguerre channel is an appropriate model for low - power optical communications when received signals contain monochromatic ( single frequency ) plus narrow band gaussian lightwaves which are related to input data and noise term respectively [ 12 ] .",
    "this model can be used for various optical communications such as free - space optical ( fso ) communications , optical amplifiers and intersatellite laser links [ 13 ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that laguerre behavior is an improved version of the poisson channel when the background noise factor is notable and it has been shown that the poisson channel turns to the laguerre one when the input of the poisson channel is corrupted by a narrow band gaussian noise [ 12 ] .    in discrete - time laguerre channels ,",
    "input data is a monochromatic lightwave and coding scheme is applied onto the intensity of it , therefore the input data must be non - negative .",
    "it is important to note that since the input data is single frequency , optical input power has an direct effect on the photons rate which arrive to the receiver .",
    "but the energy of each incident photon is identical to all the others and is independent of the optical input power and only the number of emitted photons are varied by variation of input power . at receiver ,",
    "arrival signals are a stream of counted photons and thus , the outputs of such channels , unlike inputs , can give only non - negative discrete values .    in this work ,",
    "first , upper and lower bounds for the capacity of the discrete - time laguerre channel with independent noise are calculated when the average and peak constraints are imposed to the input power .",
    "afterward , it is shown that optical coherent cdma network statistics can be modeled as a laguerre channel with input - dependent noise factor and then , some achievable rates are proposed for such a channel under different input constraints .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives system model of the optical channel whose statistics can be modeled as a laruerre distribution , in section iii , our main results are proposed and in section iv , derivation of the lower and upper bounds are presented .",
    "considering many applications for short distance visible light communication systems and optical coherent cdma networks , determining capacity of these channel models is the main key to specify maximum achievable data rates .    in this paper",
    ", a memoryless discrete - time channel is assumed in which its output and input are denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively in a way that @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "note that , while input @xmath1 takes values from @xmath4 , the output @xmath0 being a nonnegative integer is resulted from photo detector properties [ 12 ] . for coherent cdma , short optical free space systems with direct detection and optical amplifiers , it can be shown that the channel statistics , as formulated in ( [ laguerre1 ] ) , is laguerre with mean @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents noise average power .",
    "@xmath7    supposing that average power is a crucial factor , there is a limitation on maximum transmitted average power namely average power constraint as in ( [ avecon ] ) .",
    "in addition , considering that optical fibers and transmitters operate linearly in specific range of input power , another constraint -peak power constraint- can be imposed as ( [ peakcon ] ) , @xmath8 \\leq \\mathcal{e } \\end{split } \\label{avecon}\\ ] ] @xmath9=0 , \\end{split } \\label{peakcon}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote peak power and average power constraints respectively .    here",
    "we define a parameter @xmath12 as below @xmath13 where @xmath12 takes values from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath16 represents the case in which average power constraint is inactive . on the other hand , for @xmath17 , only average power constraint is taken into account",
    ". the channel capacity can be formulated as @xmath18{}{\\sup } i(x;y ) , \\end{split } \\label{alpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 represents the mutual information between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , where supremum is taken such that @xmath20=0 $ ] , @xmath21 \\leq \\mathcal{e}$ ] and @xmath22=0 $ ] .    similarly , @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the cases in which peak power and average power constraints is taken into account singly",
    ".    moreover , in coherent cdma systems , average noise power depends on average input power . while there is not such dependency between these two parameters in short free space optical systems .",
    "so our results fall into two main aforementioned categories .",
    "therefore in this paper , first set of simulations gives upper and lower bounds for short free space optical systems and in second set of simulations , lower bounds for coherent cdma systems is achieved . note that because of dependency between average noise and input power in latter systems , upper bound is not practical .",
    "in optical coherent cdma systems , first , users encode their transmitting signal and then transmit it on the channel .",
    "after that , all users data are added together and at the receiver end , each user multiplies its receiving signal to its corresponding code and reproduces transmitting data . as a result , our channel model is interfering .",
    "fig.[first ] depicts a typical coherent optical cdma network with @xmath25 users .",
    "as it is shown in this figure , first , each optical pulse is transferred to frequency domain by grating and then the transformed optical pulse is directed to the encoder phase mask and finally , the encoded pulse is transformed to time domain again .",
    "since each user has a distinct encoder / decoder phase mask , the corresponding output of @xmath26th user s pulse from @xmath27th decoder is a low intensity pulse and has a pseudonoise behavior . in general",
    ", it can be demonstrated that when @xmath26th user sends pulse with intensity @xmath28 at time @xmath29 , its corresponding intensity at the @xmath27th output side is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of mask chips ( also known as code length ) .",
    "the proof is similar to [ 17 ] .    to obtain channel statistics , we need to specify channel distribution .",
    "it can be shown that for a coherent cdma channel with @xmath25 users , channel distribution can be formulated as follows @xmath32 where @xmath33 is @xmath27th output data and @xmath34 denotes modified bessel function of first kind and zeroth order .    assuming that @xmath25 is large enough , by using weak law of large numbers ( wlln ) , we can write @xmath35=\\frac{\\mathbb{e } [ i_i]}{mn_0 } \\label{qashqash}\\ ] ] then equation ( [ qashsum ] ) can be simplified to @xmath36 where @xmath37 $ ] and where @xmath38 . for more information about coherent cdma optical systems",
    "see [ 17 ] .",
    "note that above formulations are derived without considering photo detector at the receiver end .",
    "if we take photo detector properties into account , ( [ qashqash ] ) is transformed to @xmath39 in this paper , the derivation of lower bounds is based on the data processing inequality [ 14 ] . the main idea in derivation of lower bounds",
    "relies on using an specific arbitrary distribution for input .",
    "in fact , by canceling optimization on input distribution , a lower bound can be obtained . by choosing @xmath40 distribution for input",
    ", we have [ 15 ] @xmath18{}{\\sup } i(x;y ) \\geq i(x;y),\\end{split } \\label{alpha}\\ ] ]    the derivation of the upper bound relies on the upper bound introduced in [ 16 ] as an upper bound for discrete - time poisson channel .",
    "first we show that our laguerre channel is degraded version of the poisson channel without dark current , i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the upper bound that is obtained for poisson channel can also be used for laguerre channel .",
    "the results in this paper are proposed separately for short distance visible light communication systems and optical coherent cdma networks in two subsections .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss lower and upper bounds on channel capacity under three cases : first case is in presence of average power and peak power constraints and @xmath42 , second case is in presence of average power and peak power constraints and @xmath43 $ ] and third case is in presence of only average power constraint .      for short distance visible light communication systems ,",

    "if only average power constraint is imposed , then channel can be lower - bounded as @xmath53 and upper - bounded as @xmath54    lower bound ( [ agha ] ) can also be obtained from lower bound ( [ gagaga ] ) when @xmath11 is kept fix and @xmath12 tends to zero .      as mentioned before ,",
    "in contrast to short distance visible light communication , in coherent optical cdma networks the average noise power directly depends on the average power of input signals .",
    "one evident consequence of this dependency is that , by increasing the authorized average power for input signals , noise effect increases too , and it might cause the left hand side ( lhs ) of lower bound ( [ gagaga ] ) to decrease instead of increasing .",
    "therefore , the optimum @xmath12 that maximizes lhs of ( [ gagaga ] ) , which is denoted by @xmath55 , might be different from one that found in previous section .",
    "in other words , the optimum average power that maximizes lhs of ( [ gagaga ] ) may differ from maximum authorized average power @xmath11 and as a result , @xmath56 .",
    "it is also possible that optimum @xmath12 depends on maximum peak power constraint @xmath10 . in order to find @xmath57",
    "we should solve following equation @xmath58 equation ( [ hopeso ] ) can be solved numerically . in the case",

    "however , one can propose a lower bound for coherent optical cdma networks similarly to the one proposed for short distance visible light communication by adding maximization of the @xmath12 to it .",
    "thus , in the rest of this section , a lower bound for two cases of only peak power constraint and both average and peak power constraints are presented , then , by using resulted lower bound , a lower bound is proposed for the case that only average power constraint is imposed , and finally , this section ends with a brief discussion about sum - capacity in optical coherent cdma networks .      for coherent cdma optical systems , if @xmath63 $ ] , then channel capacity can be lower - bounded as @xmath64{}{\\max } \\ ! { \\bbigg@{3.5}}\\ { \\frac{1}{2}\\log(a )",

    "the interference channel treats as @xmath25 point - to - point single channels .",
    "in such a channel the average and peak input power of each user is @xmath66 and @xmath66 respectively and also the average input power of the noise is @xmath66 for every single channel due to the power constraints , therefore , the sum - capacity can be expressed as @xmath67 it is important to note that @xmath68 is a decreasing function of @xmath25 , thus , one can conclude that for any given @xmath69 and @xmath11 , there is an optimum @xmath25 which maximize sum - capacity .",

    "in this section , derivations of the upper and lower bounds obtained in previous section are presented .    as mentioned before , for proving the lower bounds",
    ", one can drop the maximization on the input probability distribution as pointed in ( 6 ) and choose an arbitrary distribution in order to calculate the mutual information .",
    "but , since we are looking for tight lower bounds , input probability distribution must be chosen in a way that the corresponding mutual information results be as close as possible to capacity .",
    "it should be noted that not only obtaining such a distribution itself is a difficult problem , but also computing the entropy and distribution of its corresponding output might be indomitable .",

    "these distributions can be represented with the following densities : @xmath91{}{e^{-\\frac{\\mu}{a}x}},\\ \\ \\ \\ 0 \\leq x \\leq a\\ ] ] when both constraints ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are active , and @xmath92 when constraint ( 2 ) is inactive and ( 3 ) is active , and @xmath93 when only constraint ( 2 ) is imposed .",
    "derivation of upper bounds are based on data processing inequality .",
    "the proof is structured by following steps : at first , we will show that every laguerre channels with density ( 1 ) and arbitrary average noise power @xmath94 are degraded version of poisson channel with no dark current .",
    "then , with the help of markov chain and data processing inequality , we will show that every upper bounds which is valid for poisson channel with no dark current , is also valid for laguerre channel with distribution ( 1 ) , therefore , we can apply asymptotic upper bounds introduced in [ 6 ] to our model .",
    "we start the proof of the upper bounds with the following lemma :    consider the degraded channel depicted in the figure ( [ fig7 ] ) , if @xmath95 can be expressed as below @xmath96 then we have @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are moment generating function of @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "for such a channel by data processing inequality one can conclude that @xmath105 in addition , it is obvious that by adding an independent noise to output of the above channel , as depicted in figure ( [ fig8 ] ) , one can make another version of degraded channel .",
    "then , it can be concluded that @xmath106 where @xmath107 is moment generating function of the noise .",
    "also , in this channel because of the markov chain we have @xmath108 the proof of the upper bounds finishes by following lemma :      regarding to lemma 2 , it is sufficient to show that laguerre mgf can be expressed in terms of poisson mgf . considering @xmath109 and @xmath110 as a birth - death and bose - einstein process , we have @xmath111 and @xmath112 and it can be easily shown that @xmath113 the reminder of the proof is straightforward by equations ( 34 ) and ( 36 ) . therefore , we have @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the upper - bounds acquired in [ 6 ] .",
