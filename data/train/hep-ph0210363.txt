    "we study scenarios where the mssm - like neutralinos have similar masses and mixing character as in the ` typical msugra ' sps 1a scenario for the mssm @xcite .    since the singlino component does not couple to gauge bosons , gauginos , ( scalar ) leptons and ( scalar ) quarks , cross sections for the production of the exotic neutralinos are generally small .",
    "we analyze the regions of @xmath4 where the associated production of the singlino - dominated neutralino yields detectable cross sections at a linear @xmath0collider .",
    "since also the decay of an mssm - like neutralino into a singlino - dominated neutralino is strongly suppressed the decay vertex can be significantly displaced from the production vertex in the detector . within the sps 1a scenario",

    "generally the singlino content increases with increasing value of @xmath4 .",
    "the couplings of the singlino - dominated neutralino and therefore the production cross sections and decay widths are determined by the remaining mssm content , which decreases as @xmath20 in good approximation . in the sps 1a",
    "inspired scenario the gaugino content dominates the mssm content of @xmath11 , which increases the couplings to the gaugino - like @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "direct experimental evidence of a fifth neutralino would be an explicit proof for an extended susy model .",
    "an exotic neutralino which is not the lsp is omitted in the decay cascades and must be directly produced with sufficient cross section to be detected .",
    "the visibility of the cross sections for neutralinos with major exotic components is also crucial to apply sum rules in order to test the closure of the neutralino system @xcite .",
    "we discuss the associated production of the singlino - dominated @xmath11 together with the lightest mssm - like neutralino @xmath21 in @xmath31 annihilation .",
    "since in the sps 1a inspired scenario @xmath21 is gaugino - like the production proceeds mainly via @xmath32- and @xmath33-channel exchange of selectrons and the gaugino content of @xmath11 is crucial for the size of the cross section ( fig .",

    "the unpolarized cross section is larger than 1  fb for @xmath36  tev ( 9.7 tev ) which corresponds to a singlino content of 99.7% .",
    "while the cross sections in the @xmath1 model with @xmath14  gev are enhanced because of a positive @xmath28 contribution to the electron - selectron - neutralino coupling , the smaller gaugino content of @xmath11 and a negative @xmath28 contribution reduces the cross section for @xmath37  gev .",
