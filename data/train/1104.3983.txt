    "one of the outstanding developments in cosmological physics in the past decade is the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe , supposedly driven by some exotic dark energy @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the energy density of the dark energy is two - third of the critical density ( @xmath0 ) apart from dark matter ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the astrophysical data shows that this sudden transition in the expansion history of the universe is marginally recent ( @xmath2 ) compared with the age of the universe .",
    "the nature and composition of dark energy is still an open problem . with the thermodynamical studies of dark energy ,",
    "it is conjectured that the constituents of dark energy may be massless particles ( bosons or fermions ) whose collective behavior resembles a kind of radiation fluid with negative pressure .",
    "moreover , the temperature of the universe filled with dark energy will increase as the universe expands @xcite .",
    "the earliest proposal to explain the recent accelerated expansion was the cosmological constant @xmath3 represented by the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) having a negative pressure . in order to comply with the data , the cosmological constant has to be fine tuned up to 120 orders of magnitude @xcite , which requires extreme fine tuning of several cosmological parameters .",
    "the cosmological constant also poses a famous cosmic coincidence problem ( the question of explaining why the vacuum energy came to dominate the universe very recently ) @xcite .",
    "the coincidence problem is tackled with the use of a homogeneous and time dependent scalar field @xmath6 , in which the scalar field rolls down a potential @xmath7 according to an attractor - like solution to the equations of motion @xcite . but here the field has difficulties in reaching @xmath8 , while current observations favor @xmath9 with 95% confidence level @xcite .",
    "other scalar field models of dark energy include ghost condensates @xcite , tachyon @xcite , holographic dark energy @xcite and quintom quintom .",
    "it is shown that a quintessence scalar field coupled with either a dissipative matter field , a chaplygin gas ( cg ) or a tachyonic fluid solves the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "these problems are alternatively discussed using anthropic principles as well @xcite .",
    "several other models have been proposed to explain the cosmic accelerated expansion by introducing decaying vacuum energy @xcite , a cardassian term in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) equations @xcite , a generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite and a phantom energy ( @xmath10 ) arising from the violation of energy conditions @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the ` geometric dark energy ' based on the ricci scalar @xmath11 represented by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath14 represents accelerated expansion , and @xmath15 gives a super - accelerated expansion of the universe , whereas presently @xmath16 .",
    "+ models based on dark energy interacting with dark matter have been widely investigated @xcite .",
    "these models yield stable scaling solution of the frw equations at late times of the evolving universe .",
    "moreover , the interacting cg allows the universe to cross the phantom divide ( the transition from @xmath17 to @xmath10 ) , which is not permissible in pure cg models . in fact it is pointed out that a phantom divide ( or crossing ) is possible only if the cosmic fluids have some interaction @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this interaction can arise from the time variation of the mass of dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the cosmic coincidence problem is fairly alleviated in the interacting cg models @xcite .",
    "this result has been endorsed with interacting dark energy in @xcite .",
    "there is a report that this interaction is physically observed in the abell cluster a586 , which in fact supports the gcg cosmological model and apparently rules out the @xmath18cdm model @xcite .",
    "however , a different investigation of the observational @xmath19 data rules out the occurrence of any such interaction and favors the possibility of either more exotic couplings or no interaction at all @xcite .",
    "the consideration of interaction between quintessence and phantom dark energies can be motivated from the quintom models @xcite . in this context",
    ", we have investigated the interaction of the dark energy with dark matter by using a more general interaction term .",
    "we have focused on the inhomogeneous eos for dark energy as these are phenomenologically relevant .",
    "+ the outline of the paper is as follows . in the section",
    "ii , we present a general interacting model for our dynamical system . following @xcite , we consider the two interacting dark energy models like variable modified chaplygin gas ( vmcg ) and new modified chaplygin gas ( nmcg ) interact with phantom field in sections iii and iv .",
    "we found the phantom potential in these scenarios .",
    "finally , we present our conclusion .",
    "we assume the background to be a spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous frw spacetime , given by@xmath20,\\]]where @xmath21 is the scale factor .",
    "the corresponding einstein field equations are@xmath22and @xmath23here @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the total energy density and isotropic pressure respectively ( @xmath26 ) . moreover , the energy conservation for our gravitational system is given by@xmath27suppose we have a two - component model of the form@xmath28and@xmath29here @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the energy density and pressure of quintessence and @xmath32 , @xmath33 denote the energy density and pressure of phantom dark energy .",
    "the stress energy tensor for matter - energy is @xmath34.\\ ] ]    by assuming that the phantom field is evolving in an isotropic homogenous universe and that @xmath35 is merely function of time , from eq .",
    "( 7 ) one can extract energy density and pressure as @xmath36 here @xmath37 corresponds to the phantom field while @xmath38 represents the standard scalar field which represents the quintessence field , also @xmath39 is the potential . in this case , the equation of state @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 we observe that it results in the violation of the null energy condition @xmath42 , if @xmath37 . since the null energy condition is the basic condition , its violation yields other standard energy conditions to be violated likewise dominant energy condition ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) and the strong energy condition ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "due to the energy condition violations , it makes the failure of cosmic censorship conjecture and theorems related to black hole thermodynamics . the prime motivation to introduce this weird concept in cosmology",
    "does not come from the theory but from the observational data .",
    "according to the forms of dark energy density and pressure ( 8) and ( 9 ) , one can easily obtain the kinetic energy and the scalar potential terms as @xmath47",
    "firstly , let us suppose that we have variable modified chaplygin gas ( vmcg ) representing the dark energy and is given by @xcite@xmath48where @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constant parameters .",
    "the chaplygin gas behaves like dust in the early evolution of the universe and subsequently grows to an asymptotic cosmological constant at late time when the universe is sufficiently large . in the cosmological context",
    ", the chaplygin gas was first suggested as an alternative to quintessence @xcite .",
    "later on , the chaplygin gas state equation was extended to a modified form by adding a barotropic term @xcite .",
    "recent supernovae data also favor the two - fluid cosmological model with chaplygin gas and matter @xcite .",
    "suppose that the phantom field interacts with ( vmcg ) , so under this interaction ( supposing the interaction term is @xmath52 ) the continuity equations can be written as @xmath53 in case of @xmath54 we arrive at the non - interacting situation while @xmath55 exhibit a transfer of energy from the one fluid of density @xmath30 to other fluid of density @xmath56 in order to solve the above continuity equations different forms of @xmath52 have been considered .",
    "here we will proceed to solve the continuity equation ( 15 ) by taking @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is a coupling constant ) , so we get @xmath59a^{n}}\\nonumber\\\\&&+\\frac{c}{a^{3(1+\\alpha ) ( 1+\\delta + a_{1})}}\\big ] ^{% \\frac{1}{1+\\alpha } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the constant of integration .",
    "one can be seen that if @xmath61 and @xmath62 approache to zero , then @xmath63 .",
    "now for simplicity , we choose @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a positive constant .",
    "so using ( 14 ) and ( 16 ) , we obtain the kinetic term as @xmath66,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the potential energy has the form @xmath67,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the constant of integration . from the expression ( 18 ) it is clear that the potential energy is a function of scale factor @xmath70 . the graphs represented by fig . 1 and fig . 2 show that @xmath6 increases with the passage of time while the @xmath71 decreases with the increase of cosmic time @xmath72 .",
    "the model which behaves as a dark matter ( radiation ) at the early stage and _ _ x-__type dark energy at late stage is the new modified chaplygin gas ( nmcg ) @xcite@xmath73 in view of @xmath74second energy eq.@xmath75 the energy density of the ( nmcg ) can be expressed as@xmath76 ^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha } } \\]]now for simplicity , we again choose @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a positive constant . so using ( 14 ) and ( 20 )",
    ", we obtain the kinetic term as @xmath77,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the potential energy has the form @xmath78,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the constant of integration .",
    "in this work , we have considered the interacting scenario of the universe , in which phantom energy interacts with two different types of dark energies including variable modified chaplygin gas ( vmcg ) , new modified chaplygin gas ( nmcg ) . by considering some particular form of interaction term",
    ", we have constructed the potential of the phantom field . by looking at the energy conservation equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) it",
    "is found that the energies of the ( vmcg ) and ( nmcg ) are getting transferred to the phantom field . with the help of graphs we studied the variations of @xmath71 and @xmath6 with the variation of the cosmic time . from the figures we see that the potential decreases from the lower value with the evolution of the universe .",
    "thus in the presence of an interaction , the potential decreases and the field decreases with the evolution of the universe .           and @xmath72 against cosmic time @xmath72 respectively and fig .",
