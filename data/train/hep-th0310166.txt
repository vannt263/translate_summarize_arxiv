    "( [ a ] ) is less than unity unless at least three of the @xmath64 coincide , in which case the norm is unity .",
    "the proof is due to eli hawkins .      using the definition of the spin projection operators ( [ projector ] ) and the inner products of the unit vectors @xmath106 ( @xmath107 if @xmath108 and @xmath109 if @xmath14 ) we find ( a^a ) = 1 + 16 _ ( ij ) ( _ i-_j ) where the sum is over the 6 choices of @xmath110 .",
    "this trace is at most @xmath111 , and therefore the smaller eigenvalue of @xmath104 is less than @xmath107 unless @xmath112 .",

    "the matrix @xmath104 is linear in terms of @xmath114 , therefore @xmath115 is quadratic . because @xmath115 is invariant under all permutations of the @xmath116 s , it can be written as a quadratic function of the cosines @xmath117 . because @xmath115 vanishes when the @xmath116 s are all equal , it is convenient to write it in terms of the cosines minus 1 .",

    "<S> we derive a discrete path integral for massless fermions on a hypercubic spacetime lattice with null faces . the amplitude for a path with @xmath0 steps and @xmath1 bends is @xmath2 .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss a four - dimensional variant of ` feynman s checkerboard ' problem  @xcite  a construction of the propagator for the dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions via a sum - over - paths method , where the paths traverse a null lattice . in that problem , </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude for a given zig - zag path is just @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the time duration of a lattice step , @xmath5 is the particle mass , and @xmath6 is the number of direction reversals ( and we use units with @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the mass vanishes the particle moves only to the right or the left with the speed of light , and these two motions correspond to the two chiralities for a dirac spinor in 1 + 1 dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> feynman s checkerboard path integral is striking in its simplicity , and intriguing because it accounts for relativistic propagation and dirac matrices with nothing more than a simple factor of @xmath8 associated with a geometric property  a bend  in a piecewise lightlike path . </S>",
    "<S> it hints at the possibility that a simple , discrete dynamics could underly the usual continuum description of relativistic quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> a longstanding question has been whether or not a path integral could be found in @xmath9 dimensions preserving these surprising features . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that one can indeed come very close .    </S>",
    "<S> most work on lattice formulations of spinor propagation is directed at lattice field theory calculations , and thus involves grassmann variables and  path \" integrals over field configurations in a spacetime of euclidean signature  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> instead we seek a bosonic ( i.e.  non - grassmanian ) formulation in terms of a sum over particle paths on a minkowski signature lattice . </S>",
    "<S> such formulations have been studied previously in  @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> what is new here is the interesting structure of the lattice employed , and the fact that it allows for a particularly simple rule for the amplitudes .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the massless case , which in 3 + 1 dimensions is far more interesting than in 1 + 1 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the decoupled right and left chiralities are then described by two - component spinors satisfying the weyl equation , ^_=0 , [ covweyl ] where @xmath10 with @xmath11 the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> ( the + sign corresponds to right handed spinors . ) </S>",
    "<S> the lattice we use here is topologically hypercubical but  tilted on its corner \" . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum network based on this lattice was called  hyperdiamond \" and previously studied by finkelstein and collaborators@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use this name here for the lattice itself .    </S>",
    "<S> a diagonal of the hypercube defines our time axis . </S>",
    "<S> the edges from one vertex lie in the direction of the four spacetime vectors n_i^=(1,_i ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ ni ] the four spatial unit vectors @xmath12 point to the vertices of a tetrahedron , and the step speed @xmath13 is for the moment unspecified . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 sum to zero , and the inner product or angle between any distinct two is the same . </S>",
    "<S> hence for @xmath14 we have @xmath15 , and the angle is equal to @xmath16 . the spatial lattice at one time is a face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice . a way to see </S>",
    "<S> this is to begin with the tetrahedron of points that lies at one time step to the future of a given spacetime point @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the four dimensional lattice has translation symmetries that map any point to any other point , and the spatial lattice at one time must share this property . </S>",
    "<S> hence it can be grown from this tetrahedral seed by translation along the edges of the tetrahedron , which produces the fcc lattice shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fcc ] .    evolving the spatial lattice one time step to the future amounts to shifting it along the displacement from the center of one tetrahedron to one of its vertices , yielding a distinct but equivalent spatial lattice . </S>",
    "<S> after four such steps the original spatial lattice is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> it might seem natural to choose the step speed @xmath18 , so that the links @xmath19 of the hyperdiamond would be null as envisaged in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case the lattice propagator would fail to converge at all in the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that such a spacetime lattice violates the well - known  courant condition \" for stability : the discrete region of causal influence must contain the continuum one .    to marginally satisfy the courant condition , </S>",
    "<S> the polyhedral cone formed by the four hypersurfaces spanned by three of the @xmath19 s must be tangent to the continuum light cone . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the faces of the hypercube must be null . </S>",
    "<S> thus each of these hyperplanes must contain one and only one null direction . by symmetry </S>",
    "<S> this null direction must coincide with the sum of the three link vectors , e.g. @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the minkowski norm of @xmath21 is @xmath22 , hence if it is to be null we must choose @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath24 , so if @xmath23 the null vector @xmath21 is orthogonal to all vectors in the hyperplane , confirming that the hyperplane is indeed null .    now consider the tetrahedral quartet of unit vectors @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the sums @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( with ` @xmath27 ' denoting the  acomponent of @xmath12 ) are invariant under the symmetries of the tetrahedron , hence the first sum must vanish and the second sum must be proportional to the euclidean metric @xmath28 . since the trace is equal to four this yields the relation [ basis ] _ </S>",
    "<S> i_i^a_i^b=^ab . using these identities and the definition ( [ ni ] ) of the 4-vectors @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> , the matrix 4-vector @xmath29 can be expressed as ^=_i ( 1+_i)n_i^. [ sigmaalpha ] in the special case @xmath23 , for which the polyhedral light cone conists of null hyperplanes , this becomes just ^=_ip_i n_i^ , [ sigma ] where p_i=(1+_i ) [ projector ] is the projector for spin up in the direction @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> using the identity ( [ sigma ] ) the weyl equation ( [ covweyl ] ) for right - handed spinors takes the form _ </S>",
    "<S> ip_in_i^_=0 . </S>",
    "<S> [ pweyl ] we consider the hyperdiamond lattice with step vectors @xmath30 scaled by the step size @xmath4 . with the partial derivatives replaced by finite differences , n_i^_(x ) ( x)-(x - n_i ) , the weyl equation ( [ pweyl ] ) yields the one - step evolution prescription for determining @xmath31 on the lattice from the values @xmath32 at the immediately preceding points , ( x)=_ip_i(x - n_i ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ onestep ] the finite difference equation ( [ onestep ] ) is different from any typically used in lattice field theory calculations . for a plane wave solution of the form @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> is a constant spinor ) it implies the dispersion equation _ 0 </S>",
    "<S> = _ i p_i e^-ik_n_i^ _ 0 . [ nodoubles ] expanding in @xmath35 and using equation ( [ sigma ] ) , we find at first order in @xmath35 the standard weyl equation for momentum eigenstates , @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions obey the relativistic dispersion relation , @xmath37 , and the corresponding zero frequency solution has vanishing wave vector .    </S>",
    "<S> fermion doubling does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> that is , there are no additional zero - frequency solutions to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nodoubles ] ) , as we argue later . </S>",
    "<S> the nielsen - ninomiya theorem  @xcite is presumably evaded since this finite difference equation does not satisfy the hermiticity condition . </S>",
    "<S> the attendant lack of unitarity would be a problem for a lattice field theory application , but it does not present a problem for our purpose , which is just to extract a representation of the propagator as the continuum limit of a sum over paths on the lattice .    iterating eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ onestep ] ) backwards in time , we see that the retarded propagator between two points can be written as a sum over multi - step paths involving moves in the directions @xmath38 at step speed @xmath39 , with the amplitude for such a path given by the operator [ oper ] p_i_n  p_i_1 . </S>",
    "<S> the propagator is then the sum of these operators over all paths that connect the points . in terms of the unit eigenspinor @xmath40 of @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude ( [ oper ] ) becomes [ spinamp ] |i_ni_n|i_n-1i_n-1||i_2i_2|i_1i_1| . </S>",
    "<S> note that for fixed initial and final points the number of each of the four step types is fixed , so one sums only over the order in which the steps are taken .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude ( [ spinamp ] ) is independent of the choice of phases for the spinors , so we are free to adjust those phases to produce a particularly nice result . </S>",
    "<S> the unit spinor corresponding to a unit vector with spherical angles @xmath42 is @xmath43 times an arbitrary overall phase . </S>",
    "<S> the spinors @xmath40 , which correspond to the four unit vectors pointing to the vertices of a tetrahedron , can be taken as |1&=&e^i_1(1 + 0 ) |2=(1 + ) +    e^i )   |4=(1 + e^i ) [ tspinors ] if we choose @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then the inner products between the various spinors become identical up to a sign that depends on the order : [ phase ] 1|2,3,4=2|3=3|4=4|2=. thus the amplitude for an @xmath0 step path with @xmath1 bends is ( ) ^b . </S>",
    "<S> [ amplitude ] to eliminate the operator @xmath46 from the amplitude ( [ spinamp ] ) , we considered here the matrix element of the propagator with respect to fixed inital and final spinors @xmath47 and @xmath48 selected from the set ( [ tspinors ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these specify directions of arrival at the initial point and departure from the final point , and the amplitude ( [ amplitude ] ) includes any contributions from initial and final bends . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately we have not been able to find a simple way to specify the overall sign other than by reference to the positive two - step orders given in ( [ phase ] ) .    for left handed weyl spinors the amplitude for a step </S>",
    "<S> is given by the orthogonal spin projector relative to the right handed case . </S>",
    "<S> hence we can use the charge conjugates of the four spinors ( [ tspinors ] ) , with the result that the imaginary unit @xmath8 in the amplitude ( [ amplitude ] ) is replaced by @xmath49 . the effect of a mass @xmath5 can be included by allowing for chirality flips between right and left handed spinor propagation at each time step , with an associated amplitude factor @xmath50  @xcite , as on feynman s checkerboard .    </S>",
    "<S> we now evaluate the sum over paths for the lattice propagator @xmath51 for a spacetime displacement @xmath52 and demonstrate that it reproduces the continuum propagator in the limit @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> the lattice displacement @xmath52 can be expanded in terms of the four basis vectors : x^= _ </S>",
    "<S> jx^j n_j^ , [ dxi ] hence the displacement is determined by a unique set of four integers @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the constraint that a path connects the two points of interest can be incorporated as four kronecker deltas , which we express in a fourier representation : _ </S>",
    "<S> j(n^j , x^j/ ) = _ -^ e^i_j_j ( n^j - x^j/ ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice propagator is given by _ </S>",
    "<S> ( x ) = _ n=0^_-^ e^-i_j_jx^j/[a()]^n , [ prop ] where a()=_jp_j e^i_j . </S>",
    "<S> [ a ] the sum over @xmath0 of @xmath55^n$ ] produces every possible sequence of projection operators , each with the appropriate exponential factor encoding the number of steps in each direction . when the integrals over @xmath56 are carried out </S>",
    "<S> , only those step sequences that produce the displacement @xmath57 will survive . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , only the value of @xmath0 equal to the total number of steps contributes .    </S>",
    "<S> as the step size @xmath4 goes to zero , the number of steps @xmath0 for a fixed time interval goes to infinity as @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> convergence thus requires that the norm @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. the maximum norm of @xmath60 acting on a unit spinor ) be less than or equal to unity . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in the appendix that @xmath61 except when at least three of the @xmath56 coincide . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as @xmath0 becomes larger , @xmath55^n$ ] converges to zero pointwise except at these degenerate @xmath56 values . </S>",
    "<S> ( had we assumed an arbitrary step - speed @xmath62 , convergence would have required @xmath63 . )    </S>",
    "<S> when three @xmath64 s coincide @xmath60 takes the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the projector orthogonal to @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easily seen that the action of @xmath60 then decreases the norm of any spinor except an eigenspinor of @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> [ in the exceptional case where all four @xmath64 coincide @xmath60 is just @xmath68 times the identity . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to no difficulty , as the integral over @xmath69 in ( [ prop ] ) just produces a kroneker delta which sets @xmath0 equal to the total number of steps . ] fermion doubling would occur if eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nodoubles ] ) had an extra solution with zero frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this would be an eigenvector of @xmath60 with unit eigenvalue , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> inspection of the above degenerate form of @xmath60 reveals that such an eigenvector exists only if all @xmath64 vanish , i.e. if @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> we next introduce the new variables @xmath73 , in terms of which ( [ prop ] ) takes the form _ ( x ) = ^4_n=0^_-/^/ e^-i_jk_jx^j[a(k)]^n . </S>",
    "<S> [ propk ] taking the limit @xmath53 , with the time interval @xmath74 fixed , we have ^n&= & ^n + & = & e^in_j k_j p_j/2+o(n^2).[nepsquared ] moreover the limits of integration in ( [ propk ] ) approach @xmath75 , hence ( [ propk ] ) yields _ 0(x ) = ^4_n=0^_-^ e^-i_jk_jx^j e^in_j k_jp_j/2 [ propk0 ] the components @xmath76 are defined in ( [ dxi ] ) relative to the tetrahedral basis of 4-vectors @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> we computed the propagator to go between two points on the hyperdiamond lattice . in the continuum , the amplitude to arrive at one point starting from another point is zero , since only by integrating over a finite region should a nonzero amplitude arise . </S>",
    "<S> the prefactor is none other than the volume per point in the lattice , with the step length @xmath94 equal to @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> hence what we have actually obtained is the continuum propagator integrated over the volume associated with the initial lattice point .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that a very simple discrete path integral converges in the continuum limit to the retarded propagator for the weyl equation . </S>",
    "<S> although the underlying lattice is not lorentz invariant , that symmetry is recovered by the propagator in the continuum limit .    </S>",
    "<S> another symmetry not possessed by the discrete propagator is unitarity . </S>",
    "<S> this is not because discreteness and unitarity are necessarily in conflict . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as shown in @xcite , one can write a unitary discrete evolution rule on a body centered cubic lattice ( or on an alternating pair of simple cubic lattices ) whose continuum limit is the weyl equation . </S>",
    "<S> ( interestingly , unitarity and locality were shown there to _ imply _ the weyl equation . ) </S>",

    "<S> also , the evolutions of orthogonal states do not remain orthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> two points at one time have either one or no common points in their one - step future . in the former case , </S>",
    "<S> the one - step evolutions of two orthogonal states concentrated on the two initial points are clearly not orthogonal , because they overlap in just one point which will make the unique non - zero ( since @xmath99 ) contribution to the inner product . </S>",
    "<S> the evolutions therefore have  more overlap than they should \" , which presumably counteracts the loss of norm of each individual evolution in such a way that the continuum limit is unitary . </S>"
