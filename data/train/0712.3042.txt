    "since cellular adhesion sites usually operate under mechanical load , different experimental techniques have been developed to study rupture of single biomolecular bonds under an applied load .",
    "motivated by _ atomic force microscope _ ( afm ) measurements on biotin - streptavidin @xcite , it has been shown that the force at which a bond breaks under an applied load is a stochastic variable with a probability distribution which depends on the loading protocol and which can be explained by kramers theory for the escape of an overdamped particle from a potential well over a sharp transition state barrier @xcite .",
    "this insight led to the new field of _ dynamic force spectroscopy _",

    "dynamic force spectra use this relation to chart the binding landscape : a straight line in the plot of @xmath5 versus @xmath6 is characteristic for a single dominant barrier limiting escape .",
    "the slope is determined by the distance of the barrier from the ground state ( the _ reactive compliance _",
    "@xmath7 ) and extrapolation to @xmath8 yields the _ unstressed off - rate _",

    "a series of energy barriers reveals itself as a sequence of straight lines with increasing slope , thus defining different regimes , each dominated by one transition state barrier .",
    "single bond dfs experiments require a very low frequency of successful binding events to avoid multiple attachments .",
    "this renders single bond experiments time consuming and accumulation of rupture force histograms difficult . in the following , we describe dfs - experiments with the bfp on the biotin - streptavidin system at four different loading rates , in which we allow formation of multiple bonds .",
    "experimentally , the streptavidin - biotin system is the best studied example for molecular bonding . in detail , it has been investigated with afm @xcite , bfp @xcite and flow chambers @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "multiple bonds have been probed , but a persistent problem with flow chambers is that force is distributed in a heterogeneous way over the different bonds , thus rendering a quantitative analysis difficult .",
    "in contrast , force distribution is expected to be significantly more homogeneous for the bfp as used here .",
    "the higher frequency of binding events introduced here makes acquisition of rupture force histograms considerably easier .",
    "however , in order to evaluate the histograms , a theoretical model is required which allows to extract the single bond properties from the multiple bond data .",
    "deterministic models for the rupture of multiple , parallel bonds have been analysed before for constant @xcite as well as linear loading @xcite .",
    "while deterministic models describe the average number of bonds and are most appropriate for large systems , stochastic models are required for small systems with a finite number of bonds . here the simplest possible case is the irreversible rupture of a small number of equivalent bonds , which can be described in the mathematical framework of a one - step master equation @xcite .",
    "multiple bonds also allow rebinding of broken bonds , which can be described in the same framework @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied before to the case of linear loading commonly used in dfs @xcite .",
    "similar approaches have been also used to describe dfs on titin , where the different bonds may correspond to different hydrogen bonds within a single ig27-domain @xcite or to the different ig27-domains within titin @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the framework of a one - step master equation to evaluate data from multiple bond dfs on the well - established streptavidin - biotin system .",
    "because multiple bonds are now allowed in the experimental setup , the exact number of initial bonds in each experiment is a stochastic variable . by comparing numerical solutions of the master equation to experimental histograms , we can estimate the corresponding probability distribution . in this way",

    "the streptavidin - coated probe bead was firmly attached to the apex of the biotinylated red blood cell capsule .",
    "the biotin - coated test bead was maintained in a second micropipette and manoeuvred to / from the bfp probe at controlled impingement forces ( @xmath12 ) and retraction speeds by precision piezo - translators .",
    "bead positions were determined by on - line video processing at a sampling rate up to @xmath13 and with a spatial resolution of about @xmath14 .",
    "validation of our set - up was achieved by measuring rupture forces of individual streptavidin - biotin bonds for loading rates between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( data not shown , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the obtained dynamic force spectrum , which collects the most probable unbinding force for each loading rate , was in excellent agreement with previous reports @xcite .",
    "in particular , the derived energy landscape exhibits two transition barriers characterised by two reactive compliances , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "receptor - ligand bonds were established ( here @xmath19 ) of which @xmath20 are still closed ( here @xmath21 ) while @xmath22 have already ruptured ( here @xmath23 ) .",
    "the load @xmath1 applied to the transducer is assumed to be equally distributed over the @xmath20 closed bonds , thus each of them feels the force @xmath24 . in our experiments , force is increased linearly in time with loading rate @xmath3 , i.e.  @xmath4.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as compared with single bond dfs , we mainly implemented two changes in the experimental procedure .",
    "first , while an attachment frequency of @xmath25 per @xmath26 touches is the usual criterion that ensures high probability of single bond formation , we increased the surface density of specific sites on the glass beads to reach an adhesion frequency of about @xmath25 per @xmath27 touches .",
    "according to poisson statistics , this increases the likelihood of picking multiple bonds .",
    "second , and more important , since our goal was to quantitatively account for the distribution of all measured rupture forces , good accuracy for both low and high forces was required . despite its advantages of tunability and softness ,",
    "the red blood cell - based transducer is only linear for extensions below @xmath28 @xcite . in practice , this led us to set the bfp spring constant around @xmath29 and the range of explored loading rates between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in consequence , we focused on the regime dominated by the outer barrier of the streptavidin - biotin energy landscape ( with a reactive compliance @xmath18 ) .    for biotin - streptavidin ,",
    "rupture experiments with different experimental techniques indicated a dependence of unbinding forces on binding history , namely on the contact time that is available for binding before loading begins . in @xcite this was assigned to the existence of an additional energy minimum ( the absolute ground state ) which is reached only after a large contact time and is more stable against rupture than the intermediate ground state that is reached first .",

    "@xmath9 is the unstressed off - rate at vanishing force and @xmath45 is the intrinsic force scale for bond rupture , which is set by thermal energy @xmath46 and reactive compliance @xmath7 .",
    "an essential part of the modelling is a reasonable assumption on how force is distributed over the closed bonds in a cluster .",
    "here we assume that the force @xmath4 , which is determined by the displacement of the red blood cell , is independent of the number of closed bonds and is shared equally between them , i.e.  @xmath24 .",
    "in our setup , this assumption is appropriate because the bonds are attached to a solid support of finite curvature .",
    "because the binding times of tethered polymer bonds increase very rapidly with the separation of the opposing surfaces @xcite , our short contact times make formation of bonds at large separations unlikely .",
    "moreover biomolecular bonds carried by extended polymer tethers dissociate rapidly under force @xcite . therefore we expect the relevant bonds to form mainly within a narrow range of surface separations corresponding to the area of closest approach . because the tethers that attach the ligands to the solid support have a contour length ( @xmath47 ) which is small compared to the extension of the soft transducer , unbinding of a tether has a negligible effects on transducer extension and force .",

    "these results suggest that the first peaks in a series of multiple bond rupture force histograms at different loading rates as shown in can be used to achieve a quick and simple estimate of the molecular parameters .",
    "in particular , this estimate can then be used as a starting point for the detailed numerical analysis presented above .",
    "we have used multiple bond dfs - measurements with the bfp - setup to probe the outer barrier of the biotin - streptavidin bond . if multiple attachments are allowed , the frequency of successful binding events is larger than in classical single bond experiments so that information can be obtained more efficiently in the form of rupture force histograms .",
    "as demonstrated here , analysis of these histograms requires theoretical modelling of the rupture of parallel adhesion bonds under an applied load because the peaks of the histograms follow from a superposition procedure . using an established stochastic model for bond rupture under shared loading in combination with the assumption of a variable number of initial bonds",
    ", we showed for the first time how this superposition looks in practise , compare .",
    "the molecular bond parameters @xmath9 and @xmath7 were extracted in good agreement with previous results from single bond experiments .",
    "one particular feature of our approach is that with a simple model for multiple bond rupture we arrived at an extraction of single bond data which is both successful and efficient .",
    "our model for force transduction and adhesion bonds is rather generic and can be easily extended to include additional effects like finite transducer and tether stiffnesses or generalised models for the binding landscape . e.g.  it was shown for protein unfolding that analysis of histograms can be used to identify the shape of the binding landscape and identify deviations from the assumption of sharp transition barriers underlying dfs @xcite .",
    "we expect that the agreement between experimental and theoretical histograms can be improved by including more substructure into the model .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that deviations in rupture force histograms from the dfs predictions are caused by an intrinsic heterogeneity of bond parameters @xcite .",
    "the increased width and large force tails could be described imposing gaussian noise on @xmath59 . although this effect will be small compared to the variations caused by the distribution of @xmath42 and",
    "will not alter the basic results , it might explain residual events at large rupture forces ( another possible explanation is that some initial population of the biotin - streptavidin ground state exists after all ) .",
    "both examples show that for detailed studies of adhesion bonds , a model - based analysis of the histograms is required .    in this work",
    ", rebinding effects could be safely neglected .",
    "it has been shown before that rebinding is only relevant if the dimensionless loading rate @xmath95 @xcite . using the smallest value for the loading rate , @xmath96 , and the extracted bond parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", we get a value of @xmath97 , which is much larger than the largest value @xmath86 used here . in principle",
    ", multiple bond experiments also offer the chance to measure rebinding rates , in marked contrast to single bond experiments .",
    "this could be done in different ways .",
    "for example , one could control the time allowed for bond formation prior to loading @xcite .",
    "the mean number of formed bonds could be extracted as described here and then converted into a value for the rebinding rate .",
    "alternatively , one could work at small loading rate .",
    "then the master equation from had to be extended by rebinding terms @xcite . a similar procedure as described here then could be used to extract the rebinding rate . for biotin - streptavidin , the above estimate suggests that then loading rates had to be smaller by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "therefore adhesion bonds with faster off - kinetics than biotin - streptavidin might be more appropriate for this purpose .    finally , investigating multiple bond rupture will help to understand properties of biological adhesion sites which usually consist of clusters of adhesion molecules .",
    "for example , it has been found with image correlation microscopy that in living cells during cell migration , integrin adhesion receptors are preclustered with an average cluster size of three to four , which is very similar to the average cluster size studied here @xcite .",
    "thus biomimetic studies like the one presented here are essential to understand the way biological systems make use of adhesion clusters .",
