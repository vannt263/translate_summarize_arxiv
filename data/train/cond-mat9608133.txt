    "when surfactant molecules , or amphiphiles which consist of molecules that combine both polar and non - polar parts , are dissolved in a single solvent such as water , these molecules tend to form bilayer membranes where the hydrocarbon parts of each monolayer are aggregated in the middle of the bilayer to reduce the contact between the water and the non - polar parts of the molecule due to the hydrophobic interactions of the hydrocarbon chains .",
    "these membranes are not covalenly bonded , but rather stabilized by the weaker hydrophobic interaction .",
    "these membranes can have characteristic sizes which may be much larger than those of a single molecule .",
    "the sizes and shapes of these membranes can change as a function of temperature , salinity , and/or surfactant concentration . depending on the physical conditions of the system",
    ", these membranes can form random extended surfaces , regular periodic structures , or closed vesicles separating an interior from an exterior @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "some bilayer membranes are prototypes of biological systems , although it should be noted that true biological membranes have several components and greater complexity .    in a wide class of membranes",
    ", molecules move freely within the membrane forming a @xmath11-dimensional fluid offering little resistance to changes in membrane shape .",
    "such membranes are physical examples of random surfaces , which can undergo violent shape changes .",
    "molecules in membranes can also exhibit varying degrees of orientational and positional order including tilt(smectic - c ) , hexatic , and crystalline orderings similar to those found in free standing liquid crystal films @xcite .",
    "these ordered membranes provide fascinating laboratories for the study of the coupling between order and geometry , analogous in many ways to the coupling between matter and geometry in general relativity .",
    "the underlying cause of this coupling is as follows .",
    "a field describing orientational order can not be parallel everywhere if it is forced to lie on a surface , such as that of a sphere , that curves in two directions and thus has nonzero gaussian curvature .",
    "it could lower its energy by flattening the surface .",
    "an additional complication arises when order develops on closed surfaces .",
    "a closed surface can be classified according to its genus @xmath12 : the number of handles .",
    "orientational order on a closed surface necessarily has topological defects ( vortices ) with total strength ( vorticity ) equal to the euler characteristic @xmath13 of the surface @xcite .",
    "tangent - plane order on a sphere ( torus ) will have vorticity @xmath11 @xmath14 , since a sphere ( torus ) has genus @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , respectively .",
    "the continuous development of vector order on a deformable surface of genus zero will be accompanied by a continuous change from spherical to ellipsoidal shape @xcite .",
    "since vortices are energetically costly , it may be favorable for a closed physical membrane to transform into an open cylindrical structure when tangent - plane order develops in response to changes in temperature or other control variables @xcite .",
    "indeed , there are a number of experimental examples of shape changes that may be explained by the development of tangent - plane order .",
    "orientational orders for smectic - c and hexatic liquid crystals are described by an @xmath0-atic order parameter @xmath17 \\rangle$ ] with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we present the existence of the kt transition of @xmath0-atic order on a closed surface of genus zero and investigate the development of @xmath0-atic order below the kt transition temperature and the concomitant change in shape from spherical to non - spherical .",
    "an @xmath0-atic order parameter can have vortices of strength @xmath8 , and , since it is generally favorable to form vortices of minimum strength , we expect @xmath7 maximally separated vortices of strength @xmath8 to be present in the ordered phase ( low temperature phase ) .",
    "thus for @xmath18 , we expect two antipodal vortices , and respectively for @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath19 , we expect vortices at the vertices of a tetrahedron , an octahedron , and an icosahedron",
    ". indeed calculations on a rigid sphere confirm this conjecture @xcite .",
    "we also expect the vesicle shape to change from spherical to ellipsoidal , tetrahedral , octahedral , or icosahedral in the four cases above .",
    "our calculations are based on a phenomenological hamiltonian for a complex order parameter field whose coupling to shape occurs via a covariant derivative and via changes in the metric tensor @xcite .",
    "the model is almost identical to the landau - ginzburg theory of superconductivity except that vorticity is fixed by surface topology rather than energetically determined by an external magnetic field .",
    "the ordering transition we find is very similar to the transition from a normal metal to the abrikosov vortex lattice in a superconductor , and indeed our analysis follows very closely that of abrikosov @xcite .",
    "we find the order parameter , which is necessarily spatially inhomogeneous because of the topological constraint on the total vorticity , from among a highly degenerate set of functions that diagonalize the harmonic hamiltonian on a rigid sphere .",
    "this degenerate set has exactly @xmath7 zeros at arbitrary positions on the sphere and is very similar in form to fractional quantum hall wave functions @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review fluid membranes in some detail and describe their free energy as a function of curvature .",
    "we introduce a tangent - plane orientational order parameter and its coupling to shape changes in sec .",
    "the model hamiltonian for a deformable spherical membrane with @xmath0-atic order is presented in the normal gauge representation and the existence of the kt transition is described in sec .",
    "iv . minimization scheme and the calculated shapes for temperatures below the kt transition temperature to the ordered @xmath0-atic phase for @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are given in sec .",
    "v , and we give concluding remarks in sec . vi .",
    "in this paper , we use the term membrane to denote a thin film of one material that separates two similar materials ( bilayer membrane ) .",
    "we focus on fluid membranes and their possible degrees of orientational order . in fluid memebranes",
    ", there is no in - plane shear modulus and the only in - plane deformations are compressions / expansions . an @xmath0-atic membrane ,",
    "although fluid , will sustain a local orientational order defined modulo rotations by @xmath24 , which is described by a local order parameter @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "although fluid membranes can be composed of many different types of chemical and molecular species , their behavior ( shapes , fluctuations , thermodynamics ) can be understood from a unified point of view that considers their free energy of deformation .",
    "if the membrane were constrained to lie in a plane , the only relevant energy would be the compression of the molecules , that is , change of the average area per molecule .",
    "this is analogous to sound waves in a 3-dimensional fluid ; there is no low - frequency reponse of the system to shear .",
    "however , since the membrane can also deform in the normal direction , there is an additional set of modes describing the conformations of the film .",
    "these out - of - plane deformations are known as bending or curvature modes and the free energy associated with such modes is known as the curvature free energy . while a general deformation of the membrane involves changes in both volume and curvature , we shall see that the lowest energy deformations usually involve only curvature . in most systems , changing the average volume of the membrane is a higher energy process and hence is less important when effects involving the thermal behavior of the membrane are considered . for a membrane with finite thickness , we denote as pure curvature deformations those perturbations of the membrane that do not change the overall membrane volume , but where there may be local stretching and compression of different parts of the film .",
    "the location of the interface within a membrane can be chosen to lowest order in the curvature energy so that the surface which defines the interface undergoes no stretching or compression ( neutral surface ) . for long - wavelength curvature deformations whose wave lengths are much larger than the membrane thickness , the exact position of the neutral surface within the membrane is not crucial .",
    "the membrane is characterized by the area per molecule , @xmath26 , its thickness , @xmath27 , and its curvature . for simplicity , we assume that the equation of state of the membrane determines the thickness as a function of the area per molecule .",
    "a simple example is the case of an incompressible molecule where the product of @xmath28 is constrained to equal the molecular volume so that @xmath29 .",
    "we thus take the curved membrane to be characterized only by the area per molecule and its curvature . consider a locally flat , isolated interface .",
    "saturation occurs when the free energy achieves a minimum with respect to @xmath26 ; @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the free energy per molecule for a flat layer and @xmath26 is the area per molecule .",
    "the free energy per molecule is minimized when @xmath32 , the optimal value of the area per molecule which arises from a balance of terms such as the entropy and the tension terms or attractions .",
    "the entropy favors a larger area per molecule because of the greater number of center - of - mass positions and chain conformations , while the tension terms and attractions favor a small value of @xmath26 to reduce the contact of the hydrocarbon chains with the water .",
    "there can be deviations in the area per molecule from this optimal value and the energy cost of such a compression or expansion is @xmath33 where the primes signify a derivative with respect to @xmath26 . however , these deformations are typically of higher energy than the curvature deformations .",
    "a membrane can change its shape or size with a much lower free energy cost than that required to compress or expand it .",
    "it is important to remember , therefore , that for insoluble amphiphiles it is the saturation of the membrane and the minimization of the area per molecule that permits the usual surface - tension term to be neglected ; @xmath34 .",
    "the surface tension is no longer relevant since the molecules adjust their area to optimize the free energy and it is the curvature energy that determines the properties of the membrane .    to construct the effective free energy for fluid membranes , it is convenient to introduce general curvilinear coordinates @xmath35 and the metric structure .",
    "defining locally a system of coordinates @xmath36 on the membrane and denoting by @xmath37 the position of the point @xmath36 in bulk @xmath38-dimensional euclidean space , the metric tensor @xmath39 induced by the embedding is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a tangent vector to the surface , and the element of area is @xmath42 the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a covariant derivative with respects to the metric @xmath46 . in general",
    ", @xmath43 is normal to the surface [ 3 ] .",
    "therefore , in the particular case of a surface in @xmath47 , @xmath43 is proportional to the unit normal vector @xmath48 to the surface and it is written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a symmetric tensor .",
    "we can dicuss the curvature energy using symmetry considerations .",
    "the free energy must be only a function of the field @xmath37 , invariant under displacements and rotations in @xmath51 , and reparametrization - invariant .",
    "expanding in local terms involving more and more derivatives and keeping only the terms relevant by naive power counting , the most general form of the curvature energy @xmath52 up to quadratic order in the curvatures can be written in terms of the mean and gaussian curvatures and has only two terms @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is the mean curvature , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the gaussian curvature , @xmath57 .",
    "this form for the curvature energy was discussed by helfrich and canham and states that the mean curvature that minimizes the energy has a value @xmath58 , termed the spontaneous curvature of the membrane @xcite .",
    "the energy cost of deviating from the spontaneous curvature is the bending or curvature modulus , @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 , known as the saddle - splay modulus , measures the energy cost of saddle - like deformation .",
    "the spontaneous curvature describes the tendency of the bilayer membrane to bend .",
    "it is viewed to arise from the fact that the two layers of the bilayer do not have areas per molecule which are exactly equal , nor are their curvatures equal and opposite .",
    "this can result in a vesicle that is more stable than a flat , lamellar bilayer since it may be that the favorably curved outer layer has a smaller value of the area per molecule and hence more molecules in it than the inner layer .",
    "the bending moduli , @xmath5 and @xmath59 , arise from the elastic constants determined by the head - head and tail - tail interactions .",
    "it is expected that these moduli are senstively dependent on the surfactant chain length but only weakly dependent on the head - head interaction strength .",
    "the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath5 , and @xmath59 can be derived from a simple microscopic model that incorporates both the change in the area per molecule and the curvature .",
    "we note that a stable membrane will always have @xmath60",
    ". however , the sign of @xmath59 can be either positive or negative .",
    "membranes that prefer isotropic shapes where the gaussian curvature @xmath61 such as spheres or planes will have @xmath62 , while membranes that prefer saddle shapes where the gaussian curvature @xmath63 will have @xmath64 .",
    "one can show that the requirement of a positive - definite quadratic term implies that membranes are only stable if @xmath65 ; otherwise higher order curvature terms are needed to stabilize the system .",
    "we consider the spherical membrane whose topology is fixed .",
    "thus the gaussian curvature energy gives constant contribution by gauss - bonnet theorem @xmath66 .",
    "in a fluid membrane , molecules can flow freely to adapt themselves to any particular shape of the surface .",
    "if correlations among the molecular positions of the molecules forming the membrane exist , the molecules may exhibit in - plane crystalline order and form a kind of two - dimensional solid . on the other hand",
    ", the molecules may exhibit a weaker order in which the orientations are correlated at long distance scale .",
    "orientational order means that to each point on the membrane is associated a preferred direction whithin the tangent plane of the membrane .",
    "for example at high temperature , the stable phase of the membrane is generally the liquid phase with no translational or orientational order if we are considering the hexatic order , or the smectic - a phase in which molecular axes are normal to the surface for the vector order . at lower temperature",
    ", the membrane can condense into an hexatic phase in which there is quasi - long - range 6-fold bond - angle order or into a smectic - c phase in which molecules tilt relative to the surface normal . to describe sm - c ( vector ) and/or hexatic order",
    ", we introduce at each point @xmath37 on the membrane a unit vector @xmath67 in the tangent plane of the membrane . for sm - c order , @xmath67 is a true vector , invariant under rotations of @xmath68 ( p is an integer ) about the unit surface normal @xmath69 erected at @xmath37 . for hexatic order , rotations of @xmath67 by @xmath70 about @xmath69 lead to physically equivalent states .",
    "more generally , we consider `` @xmath0-atic '' order in which rotations of @xmath67 by @xmath71 produce physically equivalent states .",
    "a two - dimensional nematic with an in - plane symmetric traceless tensor order parameter is an example of a @xmath11-atic .",
    "although we know of no physical realizations of other @xmath0-atics yet , we find it instructive to consider how the development of such order affects morphological changes in spherical vesicles .",
    "to describe tangent - plane @xmath0-atic order , we introduce orthonormal unit vectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 at each point on the membrane .",
    "@xmath74 defines a local angle @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath0-atic order is then described by the order parameter @xmath76 $ ] , which can be related to the @xmath0-th rank symmetric traceless tensor constructed from the unit vector @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath0-th rank symmetric traceless tensors are the @xmath0-th rank spherical tensors .",
    "they are listed in table  [ n - tensor ] for @xmath78 and 6 . in general",
    ", there are @xmath79 components in the @xmath0-th rank spherical tensor @xmath80 since @xmath81 can be either @xmath16 or @xmath11 . by permutational symmetry , there are only @xmath82 possible independent components .",
    "however , there are @xmath83 additional traceless conditions .",
    "hence , there are only @xmath11 independent components in @xmath80 .",
    "the linear combination of these @xmath0-th rank spherical tensors @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of @xmath86 in @xmath87 becomes @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus @xmath0-atic order parameter is described by @xmath91 note that since @xmath92 depends on the choice of orthonormal vectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the order parameter @xmath93 does as well .",
    "this means that any spatial derivatives in a phenomenological hamiltonian for @xmath9 must be covariant derivatives .",
    "we now describe the hamiltonian of the membrane with orientational order in a reparametrization - invariant way . for a flat membrane",
    "the vector hamiltonian corresponds to the usual xy model @xmath94 using the fact that any spatial derivatives must be covariant derivatives and @xmath95 is the tangential component of @xmath96 , one can show that the only possible free energy term for @xmath77 which respects this @xmath97 symmetry is @xmath98 the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath99 is the vector - order stiffness and measures the strength of the coupling between the orientations of neighboring vectors .",
    "we then generalize this xy - like hamiltonian for the vector order to the @xmath0-atic hamiltonian using the @xmath0-th rank spherical tensors introduced in table  [ n - tensor ] .",
    "in general , the @xmath0-atic hamiltonian can be written as @xmath100 where @xmath4 is the @xmath0-atic rigidity . using the spherical tensors in table 1 , we find @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian for the @xmath0-atic order becomes @xmath104 in this form of @xmath105 , we neglected all terms that are irrelevant at large distance by power counting .",
    "other terms such as @xmath106 which couple @xmath77 to the principal directions of curvature of the membrane are not invariant under the global rotation by @xmath24 of @xmath77 , and are irrelevant at large distance .",
    "thus , this free energy has a full @xmath107 rotational symmetry .",
    "this is similar to the fact a 2-dimensional crystal with hexagonal or triangular structure has isotropic elastic properties at large distance scale . for @xmath0-atics with @xmath108 ,",
    "there is only one elastic constant @xmath4 . for @xmath18 or @xmath20",
    ", there are in general two elastic constants . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider the single elastic constant approximation for all @xmath0-atics .    to describe this hamiltonian in terms of a local angular order parameter @xmath109 , at each point",
    "we introduce two orthonormal vectors @xmath110 tangent to the membrane .",
    "this is equivalent to introduce a 2-_bein _ @xmath111 compatible with the induced metric @xmath39 . in components ,",
    "@xmath112 and the orthonormality @xmath113 implies @xmath114 the angular order parameter is frustrated by the rotation of tangent vectors that occurs under parallel transport on a curved surface .",
    "the amount of frustration is given by the gauge field @xmath115 , _ i.e. _ the covariant derivative of @xmath116 in direction @xmath117 defines the gauge field @xmath115 . under parallel transport in direction @xmath118 , each @xmath116",

    "in fact , @xmath115 is related to @xmath56 .",
    "the curl of the gauge field @xmath115 is the gaussian curvature ; @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the antisymmetric tensor defined via @xmath126 the covariant derivative of @xmath127 writes @xmath128 where @xmath129 satisfying @xmath130",
    ". then the @xmath0-atic hamiltonian writes @xmath131 this form of the free energy is invariant under local transformations @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "this gauge invariance corresponds to a local rotation of the reference frame @xmath116 . in terms of the complex order parameter @xmath9 ,",
    "the hamiltonian for @xmath0-atic order becomes @xmath134 where @xmath135 . in this description ,",
    "all @xmath0-atics have the same long - wavelength elastic energy .",
    "their properties can differ however , because their topological excitations are characterized by different winding numbers . since we assume that in the disordered state the membrane forms a spherical shape and there is no topological deformation of the membrane shape , order in @xmath9 is necessarily accompanied by the topological excitations called vortices . as we can see in ref .",
    "@xcite , the total winding vorticity of a vector field on a closed surface with @xmath136 handles must be @xmath137 .",
    "thus , a vector field on the surface of a sphere @xmath138 has total vorticity 2 .",
    "the minimum winding number disclination for an @xmath0-atic is @xmath8 .",
    "the energy of an individual disclination on both flat and curved surfaces is proportional to the square of its winding number .",
    "it is therefore always favorable to form disclinations with the lowest possible winding number .",
    "in addition , disclinations with the same sign repel each other .",
    "these considerations imply that the ground state of a sphere with surface @xmath0-atic order will have @xmath7 maximally separated disclinations of winding number @xmath8 .",
    "in this section , we present that in a certain region in the parameter space @xmath139 there is an effective kt transition .",
    "ovrut and thomas have discussed the structure of the kt transition of a vortex - monopole coulomb gas on a rigid sphere and have shown it is the same as in the planar case . they have shown the kt transition temperature on a rigid sphere is the same as that on the euclidean plane , _",

    "recently , we have extended the study of the structure of the kt transition to the hexatic hamiltonian on the fluctuating spherical surfaces and have shown the hexatic hamiltonian undergoes the effective kt transition at the same tenperature as in the planar case @xcite . following the procedure in ref .",
