    "one of the most fascinating aspects of many - body systems is the possible occurrence of a phase transition , either at finite or at zero temperature .",
    "this latter case is generally referred to as a genuine _ quantum _ phase transition ( qpt ) , by this meaning that it is exclusively observed in quantum many - body systems .",
    "zero - point quantum fluctuations are recognized as the fundamental ingredient of a qpt , in the same sense as thermal fluctuations are in ordinary finite - temperature phase transitions : whenever fluctuations are frozen , as in the @xmath3 classical case , no phase transition may possibly occur .    in the literature ,",
    "a qpt is also commonly said to occur when , for a given value of one of the hamiltonian parameters , the ground state of the model qualitatively changes its structure .",
    "this definition is not quite rigorous , firstly because it labels qpt any change in the universality class of the model , as well as mean - field phenomena such as saturation , secondly because it may paradoxically be extended to classical systems : as a matter of fact , qualitative changes in the structure of the minimum - energy configuration may well be observed , for a given value of some hamiltonian parameter , also in classical systems at @xmath3 , despite fluctuations being frozen . in this framework , therefore , the comparison between the behavior of a quantum system displaying a qpt and that of its classical limit becomes meaningful even at zero temperature , as shown in the next section .",
    "when temperature is switched on , the very same definition of qpt looses its meaning ; however , it is well established that a qpt induces a peculiar finite - temperature behavior which is qualitatively described by the best known phase diagram introduced in ref .  , and reported in fig .",
    "[ f.phd ] , where three different regimes appear ( _ renormalized classical _ , _ quantum critical _ , and _ quantum disordered _ ) , separated by crossover lines thoroughly discussed in ref .  .",
    "the relevance of this phase diagram is mostly due to its suggesting that signatures of a genuine quantum critical behavior may survive also at finite temperature , a fact that opens the possibility to observe them experimentally .",
    "moreover , a renewed interest has arisen since entanglement properties have entered the physics of many - body systems , and questions like `` how resistant to thermal noise are certain quantum properties ? '' became essential in order to test possible realizations of quantum devices .    despite the above phase diagram being considered as strictly peculiar to quantum systems , especially as far as the quantum critical and quantum disordered regimes are concerned",
    ", its structure results from the interplay between thermal ( _ classical _ ) and _ quantum _ fluctuations : a precise analysis of the role played by these two components is therefore necessary in order to ascertain whether the latter play an essential role or not , and to distill genuine footprints of quantum criticality to be experimentally looked for . to this end , knowing the behavior of the quantum system at finite temperature is not enough , and a careful comparison with the corresponding classical limit is necessary .",
    "the quite unexpected lack of results for the classical limit of quantum models displaying a qpt has made such comparison unavailable until now .",
    "this paper is aimed at filling this gap : we consider one of the paradigmatic models displaying a qpt , namely the one - dimensional quantum ising model in a transverse field ( qif ) , and compare its behavior with that of its classical limit , namely the classical ising model in a transverse field ( cif ) , which we study numerically , via the transfer - matrix method , and analytically , via self - consistent spin - wave theory .",
    "the result is unexpected : a finite temperature phase diagram is disclosed also for the cif , and it has the same structure of that for the qif . in full analogy with the quantum case , we identify three different regimes on the basis of the field and temperature dependence of the correlation length ; moreover , we show that the algebraic behavior , which was thought to specifically characterize the quantum critical and quantum disordered regimes , does in fact show up also in the classical system , though with different exponents .",
    "this result jeopardizes the experimental renderings based on the statement that the observation of an algebraic dependence of the correlation length implies the occurrence of a quantum critical or disordered regime  @xcite .",
    "in fact , an accurate analysis of the exponents is here shown to be necessary in order to discriminate genuine quantum effects .",
