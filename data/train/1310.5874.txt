    "the heavy nuclei with @xmath0 are generally less accessible for detailed studies with usual nuclear spectroscopy methods . for example , gamma - ray spectroscopy studies of heavier nuclei in this region began to occur only recently ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "alpha decay represents one of the main tools for the spectroscopy of excited states of nuclei in this region .",
    "however , we have recently shown that the population of the excited states through alpha decay ( the so - called fine structure ) is not thoroughly understood , precluding the full use of this process as a spectroscopic tool @xcite . thus , an intriguing evolution was observed for both the relative branching ratios and hindrance factors of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 states from the ground state band of deformed nuclei in the uranium to californium isotopes , which is apparently related to intricate nuclear structure details .",
    "figure 1 illustrates one of the most conspicuous observed effects , a remarkable maximum around mass 240 ( @xmath7 values around 142 ) in nuclei above uranium , in the relative branching ratio and hindrance factor of the @xmath8 state .",
    "such a behavior has been rather unexpected in these nuclei which are considered well deformed rotors , and its explanation is still pending , as it could not be correlated with any of the evolutions of several investigated nuclear structure observables @xcite .",
    "various features of the nuclear structure can be deduced by observing the evolution of different quantities that characterize the nucleus .",
    "thus , for example , most nuclear structure observables , even the simplest ones , such as , in the even - even nuclei , the energy of the first excited @xmath4 state , or the electromagnetic transition probability of this state to the ground state , show clear indications for the magic numbers ( major shell closures ) , and also display characteristic evolutions in between these numbers ( the collective features ) .",
    "it is also known that the nuclear masses concentrate valuable information on the structural changes .",
    "the variation of the nuclear mass with the number of protons / neutrons shows many irregularities that can be related to different structural changes , the strongest being those due to the magic numbers .",
    "finer details of the structure evolution can be observed by looking at the evolution of the nuclear masses through a proper eye - glass. such a systematic investigation was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite by looking at the evolution of a mass - related quantity , the two - neutron separation energy @xmath9 in the even - even medium mass nuclei ( with @xmath10 from 28 to 80 ) , and using as eye - glass the differential variation of this quantity as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "various other differential observables were used in ref .",
    "@xcite to highlight evolutions and changes in nuclear structure .    because the approach based on the differential of the two - neutron separation energy proved very useful in indicating not only major shell closures but also different subshell closures as well as points of phase / shape transitions , we decided to investigate in the same way the evolution of the known alpha - decaying nuclei above @xmath11 . as a result , we have found interesting features in the evolution of the derivative of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath7 and also unexpected empirical correlations between the variation of this derivative and those of the alpha - decay fine structure quantities .",
    "the analysis of the existing set of experimental data points to the importance of deformed subshell closures in these nuclei .",
    "the two - neutron separation energies @xmath9 were taken from the recent mass evaluation , ref .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the variation of @xmath9 as a function of the number of neutrons @xmath7 for the isotopes with @xmath10 from 82 to 104 ( pb to rf ) . to show the trends also for the isotopic chains with the highest @xmath10 ( 102 and 104 ) we included in some cases estimated values and errors given in @xcite ( these cases can be recognized by their larger error bars ) . a feature that is common to all mass regions",
    "@xcite is that @xmath9 decreases monotonously with increasing @xmath7 , as in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the curves for different isotopes being almost parallel ; a more accentuated decrease takes place after the magic numbers ( it is more difficult to remove two neutrons from a nucleus with a magic neutron number ) .",
    "this accentuated variation is easily observed in graph ( a ) at @xmath1 , the well known spherical major shell closure .",
    "finer details can be obtained by looking at the differential variation of @xmath9 with @xmath7 .",
    "this can be defined as : @xmath12/2\\ ] ]    from the general properties of @xmath9 it follows that for a certain mass region , such as that shown in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath13 is negative and approximately constant ( actually , a weak , practically linear variation with @xmath7 is observed @xcite ) , except for some regions with a more accentuated variation . a sudden jump to much larger negative values",
    "is observed for @xmath14 at the magic number @xmath1 - graph ( b ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath14 shows other interesting structure effects as well .",
    "for example , in the ba to gd nuclear region there is another obvious deviation from the smooth behavior , a positive bump at @xmath15  90 @xcite , which corresponds to the critical point @xmath16 of the shape / phase transition between spherical and deformed nuclei .",
    "similar features were observed in other nuclear regions , e.g. , in the sr , zr , mo nuclei a negative kink in @xmath9 ( more reduced than the one at @xmath17 ) which corresponds to the known @xmath18 subshell closure , and a positive one at @xmath19 , where a sudden onset of deformation is known , that can be also associated with an @xmath16 critical point transition .",
    "indications were also found for different other weak subshell closures @xcite . in the nuclear region considered here there is another clear negative bump , of smaller amplitude , at @xmath20 .",
    "nuclei in the region @xmath21 are all deformed , showing clear rotor features , therefore it is a deformed subshell closure .",
    "the magic character of @xmath2 has been known for a long time .",
    "various calculated nilsson diagrams show a deformed gap at @xmath2 ( e.g. , ref .",
    "this shell closure was shown to have a marked effect on the spontaneous fission half - lives of those nuclei @xcite , and its effects on the structure of the nuclei are also seen both in experimental data and calculations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one should emphasize the fact that a deformed subshell gap shows up in @xmath13 in the same way as the spherical major shell closure , that is , as a negative bump .",
    "in addition to the two shell - closure negative bumps clearly observed in fig .",
    "2(b ) , there is a smaller - scale negative bump at @xmath22 for the isotopes of u to cf .",
    "3 shows a larger scale detail of graph 2(b ) , where it can be seen that for the u , pu , cm , and maybe cf isotopes , there is indeed a negative bump that can be clearly distinguished from the fluctuating background of @xmath13 in this region .",
    "similar conclusions are drawn from examining another quantity related to the nuclear masses , the alpha - decay @xmath23-value , @xmath24 .",
    "we take this quantity from the same tables @xcite and fig .",
    "4 presents the variation with @xmath7 of both @xmath24 and its differential @xmath25/2 $ ] , for the same nuclei from fig .",
    ", the differential @xmath26 clearly shows specific bumps ( positive , this time ) at the @xmath1 spherical shell closure and at the @xmath2 deformed subshell closure , as well as a smaller bump at @xmath22 , which is statistically significant for the higher @xmath10 values ( above 92 ) .",
    "while this effect at @xmath3 , observed in both @xmath13 and @xmath26 is smaller than that due to the @xmath2 subshell closure ( @xmath27150 kev deep , compared to @xmath27400 kev ) , we can not overlook it because , as shown below , it is a real effect that clearly shows up in the evolution of other nuclear structure observables .",
    "as already emphasized , details concerning the absolute rates of the population of excited states in the ground state band of even - even trans - lead nuclei also constitute valuable indication on their structure . in refs .",
    "@xcite we have examined the evolution of the following quantities : the branching ratios @xmath28 for the population of the excited states @xmath29 , and the hindrance factors @xmath30 .",
    "the hindrance factors are defined as @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the @xmath33 ground state , and @xmath34 are the corresponding penetrabilities of the alpha particle through the barrier . in particular , for the @xmath5 state of the gsb , a pronounced maximum was observed for both these quantities , corresponding to the u , pu , and cm nuclei with @xmath7 values of 142  144 ( see fig .",
    "this striking maximum , observed in the middle of a region of well deformed nuclei could not be correlated with the behaviour of any of the different simple structure indicators that were investigated : the energy of the @xmath35 state , the ratio @xmath36 , the quadrupole ( @xmath37 ) or hexadecapole ( @xmath38 ) deformation parameters , or the @xmath39 and @xmath40 parameters of the fit of the gsb energies with the vmi formula ( or harris parametrization ) @xcite , @xmath39 being close to the moment of inertia and @xmath40 characterizing the stiffness , or rigidity , of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the evolutions of both @xmath41 and @xmath30 for the @xmath5 state of the gsb ( fig .",
    "1 ) are well correlated with that of the @xmath13 quantity discussed above . in the data discussed below",
    ", the hindrance factor values are those adopted in the ensdf database @xcite , which correspond to penetrabilities calculated according to the recipe of preston @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , hindrance factors calculated with different methods differ only in absolute values but their evolution is very similar .",
    "figure 5 shows the evolution of all these quantities as a function of the neutron number @xmath7 .",
    "the symbols represent the isotopes of ra , th , u , pu , cm , and cf for which the branching ratio of the @xmath5 state was measured .",
    "we have noticed that there is a good similarity between the variation with @xmath7 of -@xmath14 and that of the alpha decay quantities , provided the @xmath7-values are shifted by two units for the latter : that is , in fig .",
    "5(b ) and ( c ) , at the x - axis corresponding to the neutron number @xmath7 are represented the relative branching ratio and the hindrance factor for the daughter nucleus @xmath42 .",
    "figure 5 shows a rather good correlation between -@xmath14 and the logarithms of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 values of the @xmath45 state . the correlation is better in the case of the hindrance factors ( quantities in which the barrier penetrability was corrected for ) . by comparing graphs ( a ) and ( c ) in fig . 5",
    "one can see that there is a very good similarity for the variation with @xmath7 of the two quantities , with the exception of the plutonium nuclei , which have hindrance factors that are larger than those suggested by the superposition of the two graphs .    the quality of the correlation between @xmath46 and the hindrance factor of the @xmath5 state of the @xmath42 nuclei can be better appreciated in fig .",
    "all nuclei in this graph show a reasonably good linear correlation .",
    "there is some scattering of the data around this straight line , one of the most deviating points being that of @xmath47cf ( daughter nucleus ) , nevertheless the graph demonstrates a reasonably good correlation of the two quantities .",
    "as noted above , the plutonium isotopes jump out of this general pattern , at higher @xmath48 values , but their evolution is still well represented by a straight line with the same slope as that for the other nuclei .",
    "one should note that these nuclei , where the alpha decay branching is known for the @xmath5 state correspond mainly to those from the region where @xmath13 presents the small negative bump at @xmath3 discussed in the previous section .",
    "therefore , the structure effect seen in @xmath13 manifests itself strongly in a nuclear structure observable , namely the @xmath45 state alpha decay hindrance factor .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relative branching ratio and the hindrance factor values corresponding to the @xmath49 excited state vary , as functions of @xmath7 , practically out of phase with those of the @xmath45 state ( fig . 2 in @xcite )",
    ", therefore they are also reasonably well correlated with @xmath13 . because in this case there are less data points , and their scattering is somewhat larger @xcite , we concentrate the discussion on the @xmath5 state data .",
    "in the following we discuss the possible meaning of the small bump seen in the variation of @xmath13 ( figs . 2 and 3 ) at @xmath3 .",
    "the isotopes with @xmath10 = 92 to 98 show a clear minimum at @xmath22 , which is about 150 kev deep below the average background . as it is a negative bump , just like the other two corresponding to ( sub)shell closures at @xmath1 and 152 , respectively ,",
    "it is tempting to attribute it to another deformed subshell closure as well .",
    "actually , for the cm isotopes the minimum at @xmath50 has practically the same depth with that at @xmath2 , and the cf isotopes show a rather similar evolution . a good argument in favor of assigning this minimum to a subshell closure would be to compare the behavior of hf(@xmath5 ) in this region of @xmath7 values with that of the same quantity at a well established shell closure .",
    "unfortunately , the alpha decay experimental data are very scarce in this respect .",
    "figure 7 presents a graph similar to that in fig .",
    "5 , for all the other cases where the @xmath5 state was measured in alpha decay , in nuclei close to @xmath51 .",
    "only one pb isotope and three rn isotopes ( as daughter nuclei ) were found in this region .",
    "figure 7(a ) shows the strong , sharp maximum of the @xmath46 quantity at the magic number @xmath51 , and at larger @xmath7 an almost constant value smaller by a factor of about 15 .",
    "both the relative branching and the @xmath48 for the @xmath45 state of the @xmath42 nuclei behave , as a function of @xmath7 , similarly to @xmath46 , also having a large value at @xmath51 ( that point correponds to the daughter nucleus @xmath52pb ) , and a smaller average value at higher @xmath7 . for nuclei with @xmath10",
    "around 100 , which feel quite well the @xmath20 deformed shell closure ( see fig .",
    "3 ) there are no measured data for the branch of the @xmath5 state . based on these ( unfortunately limited in number ) experimental data ,",
    "one may conclude , with some caution , that the signature of a neutron shell closure is a maximum in the value of the relative branching ratio , or of the hindrance factor , of the @xmath8 state . by analogy",
    ", one can then suggest that the intriguing maximum in hf(@xmath5 ) ( e.g. , fig .",
    "5 ) indicates a possible subshell closure showing up in figs . 2 and 3 as a bump at @xmath22 , for the isotopes with @xmath53 to 98 .",
    "until now , experimental effects indicating such a neutron subshell closure have not been discussed in the literature .",
    "all nuclei corresponding to this bump have large quadrupole deformations , @xmath37 larger than 0.25 @xcite , therefore this should also be a deformed subshell closure . on the other hand , different calculated nilsson single - particle level schemes indicate that such a gap may occur for @xmath54 at @xmath37 values around 0.22  0.23 , in addition to the @xmath2 gap occuring at higher values , with @xmath37 around 0.28  0.29 @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the subshell gap predicted at @xmath54 in nuclei of mass @xmath55 is explicitely indicated , in addition to that at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the occurence of such a shell gap should result from intricate structure details that dictate the relative positions of the deformed orbitals originating in the spherical shells @xmath56 , and 2@xmath57 .",
    "we finally note that the existence of another , deformed subshell closure at @xmath3 in addition to that at @xmath2 is also consistent with the observed variation of the rigidity of these deformed nuclei . in ref . @xcite we noted that the nuclear stiffness coefficient ( which is proportional to the inverse of the @xmath40 harris parameter @xcite ) steadily increases with mass for the deformed nuclei that are discussed here",
    ". the explanation could be that after achieving permanent deformation ( generally in nuclei with @xmath7 just below 140 ) , one passes through the two regions of subshell closure , where the stiffness increases due to the reducing of the effect of the pairing correlations .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the systematics of both the differential variation of the two - neutron separation energies @xmath9 and of the alpha decay branching ratios and hindrance factors of excited states in deformed trans - lead nuclei .",
    "the differential @xmath13 proves a very sensitive tool for disclosing important information on nuclear structure changes in these deformed nuclei .",
    "thus , besides the well - established @xmath1 magic number , it clearly shows the magic character of @xmath20 , where there is a deformed subshell closure . a weaker effect is visible in @xmath13 as another negative bump at @xmath3 , which occurs for the isotopes with @xmath53 to 98 .",
    "this bump is rather well correlated with the extrema occuring in the behaviour of the alpha decay hindrance factors for the @xmath8 and @xmath58 states in the daughter nuclei ( a maximum and a minimum , respectively ) @xcite . by analogy of the behavior of this correlation with that for nuclei around the @xmath51 shell gap",
    ", one can tentatively propose that the small bump indicates another ( weaker ) deformed subshell closure , which was actually predicted by nilsson model calculations .",
    "it is interesting to observe ( fig .",
    "3 ) that the cm isotopes , for which the experimental data span the @xmath7 range from 140 to 152 , feel equally strong both the @xmath50 assumed subshell gap and the well - recognized @xmath2 gap .",
    "an experimental confirmation of the observed type of correlation ( larger @xmath48 values at the magic numbers ) also for the heaviest nuclei with @xmath59 spanning the @xmath20 subshell closure would be extremely valuable .",
    "we have no explanation why the @xmath3 bump in @xmath13 , clearly indicating an interesting nuclear structure effect , manifests itself strongly in the alpha decay population of the higher spin members of the ground state bands @xmath8 and @xmath49 .",
    "it does not appear to have a visible effect on the @xmath35 state data @xcite .",
    "one should remark , nevertheless , that the @xmath35 state is populated in the alpha decay with a relative branching ratio @xmath60 roughly in the range 2 to 10 , whereas the population of the @xmath8 state appears , by comparison , as a much weaker phenomenon , with a relative branching ratio roughly between 100 and 4000 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , and even larger , of the order of @xmath61 at the magic number 126 ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "the possible occurence of another deformed subshell gap at @xmath3 opens up interesting questions about the intricate structure details of these nuclei , because the equilibrium shapes of such massive nuclei result from the interplay of many degrees of freedom , among which the quadrupole , hexadecapole , and octupole deformations play an important role .",
    "also , how subshell closures in @xmath7 correlate with @xmath10-values is another interesting aspect . finally ,",
    "although the detailed mechanism of the population of the excited states in the alpha decay process is not understood yet , the present experimental systematics indicate that the alpha decay fine structure is a spectroscopic tool with an extraordinary sensitivity , comparable to that of the eye glass constituted by the differential variation of the two - neutron separation energy .",
