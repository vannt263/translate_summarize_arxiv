    "planet formation is hypothesized to occur through the growth of protoplanetary bodies formed from gas , dust and ice grains in an accretion disk around a central star @xcite .",
    "the complex scenario of the planet formation process involves the following four stages .",
    "firstly , the initial collapse of interstellar gas to create the central protostar ( @xmath0my ) ; secondly , the slow accretion of mass onto the star and the formation of primary planetesimals within the evolving accretion disk ( @xmath1 my ) ; thirdly , a phase ( @xmath1 my ) of reduced accretion rate allowing the photoevaporative wind to divide the disk into an inner and an outer region at a radius determined by the ratio of the stellar accretion rate to the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation ; finally , there is a _ clearing phase _",
    "( @xmath0my ) during which the inner disk accretes onto the star while the lightest elements of the outer disk are removed due to direct exposure to photoevaporative uv flux .",
    "recent cosmochemical evidence reveals that the long held view of a @xmath1 my age difference between ca - al - rich inclusions ( cais ) within carbonaceous chondrite meteorites and chondrules within chondrites can be refuted @xcite . to the extent that these data demonstrate commensurability over disk lifetime scales of cai and chondrule formation ,",
    "the detailed transient development of matter within circumstellar disks becomes all the more compelling for studies that can isolate essential physical processes .",
    "here we focus on fundamental aspects of the second stage above .",
    "this stage is crucial for understanding how the material that forms the building blocks of planets can organize into bodies that thwart the radiative pressure effects in the subsequent stages that sweep the disk of small particles and gas .",
    "the accretion disk is treated as a two phase system defined by a fluid phase ( ` gas ' ) and solid particles ( ` dust ' ) advected by the fluid .",
    "ubiquitous attractive long range van der waals and electrostatic interactions facilitate the agglomeration and growth of small ( micron or smaller ) dust grains that are brought into proximity by the turbulent flow of the gas .",
    "however , depending on the material and the mechanical and thermodynamic conditions of a particle - particle collision , sticking ( through a number of mechanisms ) , fragmentation , or bouncing will determine the fate and the size distribution of accreting matter from the small scales upward @xcite .    because the central star creates a radially decaying pressure gradient , the gas moves at a slightly sub - keplerian speed .",
    "thus , depending on the position in the disk , there are a range of particle sizes that experience a strong `` headwind '' and so lose angular momentum , thereby driving them into the central star on time scales as rapidly as a century @xcite .",
    "we are concerned with the long standing problem of how , when objects grow and begin to experience the local headwind , they can accumulate matter sufficiently quickly to slow their drift inward . to focus the question",
    ", we examine in some detail how a meter sized object grows by accretion of small particles mediated by turbulent flows of the gas .",
    "the typical value of the `` disk mach number '' @xmath2 is based on the keplerian velocity @xmath3 , which in the thin disk approximation is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the radial position in the disk and @xmath6 is its vertical scale height . at @xmath7au , @xmath8 and hence @xmath9 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "now , as noted above , because the central star creates a radially decreasing pressure gradient , the gas moves at a sub - keplerian speed @xmath10 where @xmath11 can be as small as @xmath12 depending on the position in the disk .    to understand the effects of the interaction between the dust and the gas , we begin by considering a solid body of spherical shape with radius @xmath13 , moving through a gas with kinematic viscosity @xmath14 and speed @xmath15 .",
    "we estimate its reynolds number as , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mach number of the headwind and @xmath18 the mean - free - path of the gas molecules .",
    "importantly , for this estimate we have used the well - known expression for the viscosity of gases @xmath19 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "now , because @xmath20 , we can have @xmath21 , and hence , so long as @xmath22 , the local reynolds number of the solid body is less than unity .",
    "for @xmath23 the size of the solid body is well below the smallest hydrodynamic length scale in the gas and its motion is then described by the simple drag law @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the velocity of the particle , @xmath26 is the local velocity of the gas , and @xmath27 is the so - called stopping time describing the deceleration of particle motion relative to the gas .",
    "when a particle is smaller than the typical hydrodynamic length scale in the problem , @xmath27 is given by the epstein drag law , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the material density of the solid particles and @xmath30 is the gas density . when @xmath31 , the relevant drag law is that of stokes and @xmath27 is given by @xmath32 despite the fact that when @xmath33 , the simple drag law no longer describes the motion of the dust particles , most numerical approaches to these problems ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) continue to use it because a more accurate description is computationally prohibitive . here",
    "we will call bodies of approximately this size `` boulders '' .",
    "the mean - free - path @xmath18 in an accretion disk varies with radius ; e.g. , according to the minimum mass solar nebula model @xmath18 ranges from @xmath34 at approximately @xmath35 au to @xmath36 at @xmath37 au .",
    "hence @xmath38 ranges from @xmath39 in inner disk regions to @xmath40 at about @xmath37au . a more accurate approximation of the motion of such particles is given by the maxey - riley equation @xcite , which assumes a spherical geometry .",
    "while the maxey - riley approach is appealing on fundamental grounds , it has yet to be used in simulations of fully developed turbulence .",
    "a crucial and often - used assumption is that all collisions have a sticking probability of unity . indeed , under such an assumption planetesimal growth under a wide range of disk conditions",
    "is sufficiently rapid that there is no loss to the central star",
    ". clearly , however , the probability of sticking depends , among other things , on the collisional velocity , the material properties of the colliding bodies , the ambient temperature , and the relative particle size .",
    "it is a commonly accepted picture that for collisional velocities @xmath41 above a certain threshold value , @xmath4210cms@xmath43 , particle agglomeration is not possible ; and elastic rebound overcomes attractive surface and intermolecular forces ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , for bodies covered with ice , experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of collisions between dust grains and meter - sized objects have elucidated the range of collisional velocities ( which depends on the relative particle size ) over which perfect sticking occurs .",
    "this latter work considers the basic role of the phase behavior of matter ( phase diagrams , amorphs and polymorphs ) in leading to so - called _",
    "collisional fusion_. in this fusion process , a physical basis for efficient sticking is provided through collisional melting / amphorphization / polymorphization and subsequent fusion / annealing to extend the collisional velocity range of sticking to @xmath44 1100ms@xmath45 , which encompasses both typical turbulent rms ( root - mean - square ) speeds and the velocity differences between boulders and small grains @xmath4650ms@xmath43 .",
    "moreover , bodies of high melting temperature and multicomponent materials , such as silicon and olivine , can fuse in this manner depending on the details of their phase diagrams .",
    "hence , in principle , the approach provides a framework for sticking from the inner to the outer nebula . here",
    ", we explore the influence of such a range , @xmath47 , on the growth of a boulder in a simulated disk .",
    "the fate of the boulder is studied from a reference frame fixed to it , while the gas flows around it .",
    "we provide an accurate description of the flow by performing a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) with no - slip and non - penetrating boundary conditions on the boulder surface using a numerical technique called _ immersed boundary method _ @xcite .",
    "hence , there is no ad hoc approximation involved in describing the mutual interaction between the boulder and the gas flow .",
    "however , at present , it is computationally prohibitive to solve for more than one boulder using this dns scheme",
    ". consequently we focus our study on the flow mediated collisions between one boulder and many `` effectively '' point sized dust grains whose sizes are much smaller than @xmath38 . our principal approximations in treating the motion of the dust grains are ( a ) to use and ( b ) to ignore the back - reaction of the dust grains onto the flow .",
    "advected by the turbulent disk flow , the dust grains collide with the boulder and we compute the pdf of the normal component of the collisional velocity .",
    "the mechanism of formation of planetesimals from dust grains is modeled by the same tools that are used to study , for example , hydrometeor growth in the terrestrial atmosphere , namely the coagulation / fragmentation equations of @xcite ; see , e.g. , @xcite , for a recent review .",
    "the smoluchowski equations are integro - differential equations that require two crucial ingredients : the probability distribution function of relative collisional velocities of the bodies in question and their sticking efficiency .",
    "the former , particularly for the inner disk region , is strongly influenced by turbulence .",
    "recently , there has been significant progress in calculating the statistical properties of individual particle velocities @xcite and , perhaps more importantly , pairwise relative velocities @xcite from direct numerical simulations .",
    "similar results have also been obtained from both phenomenological @xcite and shell @xcite models of turbulence .",
    "while these approaches provide key insights and intuition , they also leave open aspects with which the strategy we take is not burdened , such as ( a ) the use of the simple drag law   to describe the motion of boulders , ( b ) the ability to obtain only the root - mean - square collision velocity , rather than the pdf of collision velocities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* are exceptions ) , ( c ) not modeling actual collisions , so that collisional velocities are inferred from looking at relative velocities at small distances . to calculate the pdf of collisional velocities between a boulder and small dust grains",
    ", such approximations may be too simplistic because of the presence of a boundary layer around the larger object .",
    "indeed , @xcite have recently pointed out the importance of using the pdf of collisional velocities instead of simply the root - mean - square value . however , taking this into account in a global ( or even local ) simulation of a disk is computationally prohibitive .",
    "therefore , we take an initial modest step to try and understand such collisions by solving the equations of motion for weakly compressible fluids in two dimensions with a circular object  the boulder  inside .",
    "we ignore two classes of collisions , ( a ) between dust grains themselves , and ( b ) between two or more boulders .       along the arrow shown in the figure .",
    "the body force does not act directly on the particles , which are introduced continuously in a small area in the right half of the domain .",
    "initial positions of a few particles are shown as red dots.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( -80,50)(-1,0)30(-90,60)@xmath48    our computational domain is a rectangular box divided into two equal parts ( ) . in the right half , fluid turbulence is generated by external forcing that is non - zero between the two dashed lines shown in .",
    "the turbulence thus generated is moved toward the `` boulder '' by the action of a body force @xmath49 in the direction of the arrow shown in the figure .",
    "this body force is responsible for generating a mean flow , which models the head - wind faced by a boulder  the circular object at the left half of the domain .",
    "the boundary layer around the boulder is fully resolved by imposing non - penetrating and no - slip boundary conditions using the immersed boundary method .",
    "after the flow has reached a stationary state , we introduce @xmath50 particles into the right half of the domain as depicted in .",
    "the motion of these particles obeys the simple drag law , @xmath51 with the characteristic drag time of the `` dust particles '' @xmath52 . as noted before and as is clear from context , no such assumption need be made for the boulder .",

    "we see that for small @xmath58 the peak of the pdf lies very close to @xmath15 , but as @xmath58 increases the peak moves to smaller velocities by only a very small amount .",

    "the tail of the pdf at high @xmath71 is severely cut off as the stokes number is decreased by a factor of @xmath96 .",
    "one can understand this as follows ; when the stokes number decreases , the dust grains begin to follow streamlines and hence never collide with the boulder .",
    "the implication of this is clearly that a _ smaller stokes number _ implies a _ smaller number of high - impact collisions_. nevertheless , the most striking result for the problem at hand is the insensitivity of the pdf to @xmath58 and @xmath89 .",
    "our simulations take place in the reference frame of the boulder .",
    "although the boulder is also comoving with the local gas with velocity @xmath3 , the head wind corresponds to @xmath15 in our simulations , thereby setting the velocity scale .",

    "the magnitude of the headwind in the disk is estimated to be @xmath98 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the astrophysical literature",
    "it is common to non - dimensionalize @xmath52 with @xmath99 , the keplerian frequency , to define the orbital stokes number , @xmath100 . here",
    ", we use the largest eddy time scale @xmath56 , to obtain @xmath89 .",
    "these two stokes numbers are related by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the characteristic time scale of the keplerian orbit is defined by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the orbital radius . using the definition of the two time scales @xmath105 and @xmath102",
    ", we obtain the ratio of the two stokes numbers to be @xmath106 where we have used @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath10 with @xmath109 .",
    "we have used stokes number ranging from @xmath110 to @xmath73 which in turn gives @xmath111 to @xmath112 .",
    "we use the same conventions used in the supplementary information of @xcite to convert the value of @xmath100 to a radius of the dust grain ; this implies that our `` dust particles '' are of the size of tenth of millimeters or smaller .",
    "clearly the `` dust particles '' are smaller than hydrodynamic scales , and hence it is justified to consider them as point objects whose motion are described by the epstein drag law .",
    "the pdfs of collisional velocities show that , irrespective of the reynolds number and the stokes number within the range considered by us , most collisions occur at velocities rather near to @xmath15 .",
    "to illustrate this in we have drawn two vertical dashed lines at @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the area under the pdf between the two lines includes approximately @xmath115 of the total number of collisions .",
    "translated to parameters in the disk , this implies that , if there is a mechanism by which dust grains with velocities ranging from @xmath116 to @xmath117 would stick to a boulder , then we could consider @xmath115 of collisions to have a perfect sticking probability .    roughly speaking ,",
    "this implies a range of velocities @xmath118 .",
    "these collisional velocities are far too high for the bodies to fuse by attractive intermolecular forces . an alternative scenario by which the colliding bodies can fuse at high speed has been suggested by @xcite . as discussed in section [ sec : stick ] , the very high local pressures that occur during a collision can lead to phase change . if , when the pressure begins to relax during rebound the momentarily liquified ( or disordered ) interfacial material re - freezes ( or anneals ) before particle separation ,",
    "then fusion can occur .",
    "the idea was demonstrated when the colliding bodies are covered by ice , but the theory is generally applicable to all materials whose phase diagram is known in detail .",
    "an example of the process in a high melting temperature material ( silicon ) was noted in @xcite .",
    "hence , whether the range of collisional velocities over which such process can occur in a material such as olivine matches with the range we find here is a topic of ongoing research .",
    "note that here the particle reynolds number @xmath58 varies linearly with the particle radius but the range over which most of the collisions occur does not depend sensitively on @xmath58 , and hence not on the particle radius .",
    "thus , runaway growth of the boulder through the accretion of dust grains is a viable mechanism in areas of the disk where collisional fusion can operate in the range we obtain .",
    "to describe the motion of micron sized dust grains in a protoplanetary disk the simple drag law of is sufficient .",
    "theoretical estimates ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that micron sized dust particles in the inner disk ( about @xmath96au ) can grow up to a size of @xmath37 s of centimeters if we assume that the presence of turbulence increases the number of collisions and that almost all collisions result in coagulation by long - ranged intermolecular forces .",
    "but the process that allows them to continue to grow to the size of planetesimals is not well understood .",
    "as the dust grains grow , at some stage they become boulders and their local reynolds number exceeds unity . at this stage",
    "we need a more accurate description of their interaction with the gas than the one provided by . here",
    "we provide such a description of a boulder colliding with dust grains by using the immersed boundary method of @xcite .",
    "remarkably , we find that the pdf of collisional velocities depends weakly on @xmath58 and @xmath89 . in particular , we find that , if collisional fusion between dust grains is possible in the range of collisional velocities @xmath47 between @xmath119 to @xmath117 , then approximately @xmath115 of the collisions exhibit perfect sticking and runaway growth of a boulder to a planetesimal is possible .",
    "whether collisional fusion can occur in this range is a problem of material science under extreme conditions and is the subject of ongoing research and a future paper .",
    "recent studies @xcite have pointed out that the pdf of collisional velocities is a crucial ingredient to the coagulation - fragmentation models .",
    "in particular , @xcite have assumed the pdf of collisional velocities to be maxwellian , and have concluded that , by virtue of considering a pdf that is continuous at small values of its argument , growth by sticking is possible even if the sticking efficiency is determined by long - ranged intermolecular forces ( sticking with efficiency unity if the relative velocity of collisions is less than 5cms@xmath43 ) . here , we determine numerically the pdfs for the classes of collisions between boulders and dust grains and find that it can not be simply described by a maxwellian distribution - although it does have an exponential tail .",
    "it is well known that in turbulent flows the pdf of the velocities of a tracer particle is gaussian .",
    "we do not know of any study of the pdf of velocity of inertial particles ( particles that obey ) in turbulent flows , but it is reasonable to assume that it would also be gaussian . if such an assumption holds , then we expect the pdf of collisional velocities to have an exponential tail , so long as the size of particles is not comparable . were the colliding particles to be of roughly the same size , the pdf may indeed have a power - law tail by virtue of intermittency .    in an earlier paper",
    ", @xcite found that dust monomers advected by a steady laminar flow do not collide with a spherical solid body with of radius much larger than the hydrodynamic length scale .",
    "the crucial limitation in their work was to assume the flow to be laminar . here",
    ", we have considered turbulent flow and have obtained a different result , i.e. , a significant percentage of the dust particles do hit the solid body with the pdf of collisional velocities peaking around the speed of the head wind .",
    "there exists an alternative scenario of planetesimal formation @xcite in which the boulders are described by the simple drag law but their back - reaction on the gas is accounted for .",
    "this is predicted to give rise to `` streaming instabilities '' which form boulder clusters around high pressure regions .",
    "such clusters are then expected to coagulate by mutual gravitational interaction . in the light of the arguments presented in the present paper ,",
    "this streaming instability scenario requires further investigation .",
    "this is because basic physical principles tell us that the description of the motion of the boulder is inadequately described by .",
    "while the immersed boundary method can potentially solve this problem we need to have massive computational resources to examine the fate of many boulders .",
    "we conclude by pointing out the limitations of our study .",
    "firstly , here we confine ourselves to two dimensions . on the one hand",
    ", this has the virtue of permitting a larger range of @xmath58 that can be easily accessed numerically .",
    "on the other hand we can not capture the richness of particle fusion in the remaining dimension .",
    "however , we believe that this may imply that the growth of the particle we have studied to be a lower bound . secondly , when collisional fusion starts operating the initial spherical object we study will not remain spherical .",
    "this may quantitatively affect further growth in a manner that depends on how the boulder tumbles through the disk .",
    "thirdly , the turbulence in our flow is generated by external forcing .",
    "it would be appropriate to use shearing - box simulations in three dimensions where the flow is driven by magneto - rotational instability .",
    "we believe that these rather clear limitations do not detract from the robust results obtained in this study , which clarify the microphysical questions for a range of colliding materials and the computational fluid dynamics issues that will advance a sober assessment of planetesimal formation processes .",
