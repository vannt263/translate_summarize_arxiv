    "in addition , the fact that the sphere and the torus have the same `` entanglement entropy density '' per unit boundary length , allows us to compare the difficulty of dmrg simulations on spherical and toroidal geometries based on considerations of linear sizes alone .",
    "conventional wisdom might be that the torus is significantly more difficult to treat using dmrg , because it is a system with periodic boundary conditions while the sphere is more analogous to a lattice system with open boundary conditions .",
    "however , the torus has the same block boundary length everywhere ( @xmath103 for the hardest case of unit aspect ratio ) , while the block boundary on a sphere varies . for dmrg on a spherical geometry ,",
    "the dominant reduced entropy contributions comes from the equator region , where the block boundary is @xmath104 .",
    "the torus boundary is only a factor @xmath105 larger than the sphere case , rather than being twice as large .",
    "moreover , from the two edges one benefits twice the ( negative ) contribution from the topological part of the entanglement entropy ( in contrast to a single contribution on the sphere ) .",
    "we therefore infer that dmrg on the torus geometry is not as drastically more difficult compared to the sphere case , as would be suggested by the argument of two block boundaries versus one .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath106 in a bipartition of a quantum state puts a lower bound on the number of states @xmath107 to be kept in an accurate dmrg simulation through the relation @xmath108 .",
    "the computational complexity of dmrg being polynomial in @xmath107 , the scaling of @xmath106 with system geometry is thus of primary importance . in the simplest cases , _",
    "e.g. _ , one dimensional gapped quantum systems with local interactions , the entropy @xmath106 does not depend on the block length , enabling dmrg simulations for basically infinite systems at constant @xmath107 .",
    "torus fqh simulations at _ constant _",
    "@xmath28  @xcite also belong to this tractable class .",
    "if one is however interested in describing true bulk fqh systems at fixed aspect ratio ( @xmath109 ) , then entropy @xmath106 will scale linearly with @xmath110 .",
    "this translates into @xmath111 $ ] , i.e. , accurate dmrg simulations for bulk fqh states scale exponentially in the physical width , similar to 2d lattice models  @xcite .",
    "the present work opens up a number of directions deserving exploration .",
    "our analysis provides a way to decide on whether or not available wavefunction sizes provide access to the entanglement scaling regime .",
    "thus , as bigger wavefunctions become available , our analysis can be applied directly to obtain better calculations of the topological entanglement entropy @xmath9 .",
    "eventually , this type of calculation could become a standard tool for diagnosing unknown or poorly - understood fqh states .",
    "another obvious direction is the study of entanglement scaling through geometric deformations at other fractions and more complicated states",
    ". it may also be interesting to try to devise continuous geometric tuning parameters for other geometries , _",
    "e.g. _ , one may consider ellipsoidal geometries as deformations of the sphere , although setting up the landau level problem in such geometries is not straightforward or convenient .",
    "it is possible that a combination of various deformation considerations might lead to further refined procedures for estimating entanglement scaling and @xmath9 .",
