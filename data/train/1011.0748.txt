    "how a specific trading mechanism effects on the price formation is one of the essential queries to understand the process and outcomes of exchanging assets under a given concrete rule . to investigate the issue ,",
    "a lot of studies concerning the micro - structure of markets have been done in various research fields @xcite .",
    "recently , lots of on - line trading services on the internet were constructed by several major banks such as the sony bank @xcite . as the result",
    ", one can gather a lot of trading data sets to investigate the statistical properties extensively . as such studies , several authors focused on the fact that the sony bank uses a trading system in which foreign currency exchange rates change according to a first - passage process ( fpp ) @xcite .",
    "automatic forex trading systems such as the sony bank are now popular in japan where many investors use a scheme called _ carry trade _ by borrowing money in a currency with low interest rate and lending it in a currency offering higher interest rates . with these demands in mind , several studies have been done to investigate the stochastic process and made a model of it to reproduce the fpp in order to provide useful information for customers @xcite .",
    "the data sets of the sony bank rate @xcite are composed of time index and trading rate at that time .",
    "as we explained , a huge number of market data are reduced to a small amount of it , namely , the number of the sony bank rate is reduced by the first - passage process and unfortunately , the market rates behind the sony bank rate are not available for us .    as well - known , there are several data sets whose price are determined by the so - called _ double - auction _ system . in the double - auction market , each trader ( investor ) posts his ( or her ) selling price or buying price in market order of a specific commodity with its volume to the market .",
    "then , the market maker determines the minimum price of buying orders , what we call _ ask _ , and the maximum price of selling orders , the so - called _ bid _ at each trading time and discloses these prices to the public .",
    "then , the difference between the bid and the ask is referred to as _ spread _ or _ bid - ask spread_. in market rates available for traders ( on the web for instance ) , there are two types of bid - ask spread , that is , ` constant ' or ` distributed ' , and which type of spread is disclosed depends on the market makers ( securities companies ) .    results of market making , especially , statistical properties of the bid - ask spread might have an impact on the market and several studies have been done to reveal the relationship between the properties of bid - ask spread and behaviour of the market @xcite .",
    "for instance , madhavan , richardson and roomans @xcite proposed a phenomenological model to explain the price dynamics of double - auction market in market order , however , their model is apparently limited to the case in which the bid - ask spread remains constant during the price dynamics .",
    "therefore , much more extensive studies including empirical data analysis seem to be needed to investigate to what extent the model proposed by madhavan , richardson and roomans can explain the behaviour of market with _",
    "stochastic _ bid - ask spread through some relevant quantity .    in this paper , we investigate statistical properties of double - auction markets with bid - ask spread through the dynamical quantities such as response function .",
    "we first attempt to examine the so - called _ madhavan - richardson - roomans model _ ( mrr for short ) to simulate the stochastic process of the price - change in empirical data sets ( say , eur / jpy or usd / jpy exchange rates ) in which the bid - ask spread fluctuates in time .",
    "we find that the mrr theory apparently does not simulate so much as the qualitative behaviour ( ` non - monotonic ' behaviour ) of the response function calculated from the data sets .",
    "it is possible for us to show that a linear relationship @xmath3 between auto - correlation function @xmath2 and response function @xmath0 holds for the mrr model .",
    "namely , these two macroscopic quantities are related each other and the relationship should be explained from the microscopic view point as statistical physics provides the microscopic foundation of thermodynamics . moreover ,",
    "we find that the linear relationship @xmath3 is apparently broken down in order - driven double - auction markets with fluctuating bid - ask spread . this fact tells us that on the analogy of physics , the phenomenological mrr model for the constant spread might be regarded as ` thermodynamics ' which usually deals with the macroscopic quantities such as price , auto - correlation , response functions and the relationship between them .",
    "it does not need to consider the detail behaviour of microscopic ingredients such as traders .",
    "in this paper , we show that the phenomenological model is apparently limited and fails to reproduce the dynamical quantities @xmath7 efficiently .    hence",
    ", here we attempt to construct a kind of ` statistical mechanics ' in finance , which provides a microscopic foundation of phenomenological theory such as the mrr model . for this end ,",
    "we utilize the minority game with a finite market history length having the distributed bid - ask spread to reproduce similar behaviour of macroscopic dynamical quantities as the empirical evidence shows .    in our minority game modeling ,",
    "we first fix each decision component ( buying : @xmath8 , selling : @xmath9 ) in their look - up tables before playing the game ( in this sense , the decision components are ` quenched variables ' in the literature of disordered spin systems such as spin glasses @xcite ) .",
    "we also consider the case in which a certain amount of traders update their decision components according to the macroscopic market history ( they ` learn ' from the behaviour of markets ) so as to be categorized into two groups with a finite probability ( in this sense , the components are now regarded as ` annealed variables ' ) .",
    "namely , at each round of the game , if the number of sellers is smaller / greater than that of buyers , a fraction of traders , what we call _ optimistic group_/_pessimistic group _",
    ", is more likely to rewrite their own decision components from @xmath9/@xmath8 to @xmath8/@xmath9 .",
    "we find that the minority game modeling with the adaptive look - up table reproduces the non - linear relationship @xmath4 ( @xmath5 stands for a non - linear function leading to ` @xmath6 -shapes ' ) more effectively than fixed ( frozen ) look - up table does .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ sec : data ] , we explain our data sets and their format . we investigate their statistical properties . in the next section [ sec : data_analysis ] , we evaluate two relevant quantities , namely , the auto - correlation function @xmath2 and the response function @xmath0 , which are our key quantities to discuss the double - auction markets , for our data sets .",
    "we find that a linear relationship @xmath3 holds for the data sets having a constant bid - ask spread , however , the relation is broken for the data with a stochastic spread . in section [ sec : mrr ] , we introduce the so - called mrr model as a phenomenological model and derive the @xmath2 and @xmath0 . the difference between the mrr theory and the empirical evidence , the origin of the difference is discussed . in section [ sec :",

    "the last section is summary .",
    "in order to check the validity of our modeling of markets , we gathered data sets of double - auction markets from the web site http://www.metaquotes.net/ @xcite by using the free software _ metatrader4_. we shall explain the data format of the _ matatrader 4_. we used the script which is available on the web @xcite . by using the script ,",

    "each data set contains @xmath10-data points .    in the conventional ( standard ) data for continuous - time double - auction markets , we usually use the data having transactions ( buying or selling price and the transaction time ) including the quote ( bid and ask prices posted to the market with the time ) . however , unfortunately , the data set provided by the _",
