    "let @xmath1 be a domain ( a connected , open set ) in the riemann sphere .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is a quasi - disk if it is the image of the unit disk @xmath3 under a quasiconformal homeomorphism of @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", @xmath4 is a jordan curve that is quasisymmetrically equivalent to the unit circle @xmath5 . from the viewpoint of quasiconformal geometry , and the viewpoint we adopt in this paper , quasi - disks and quasi - circles form extremely nice classes of metric objects .",
    "here we are interested in two other classes of domains in @xmath0 : john domains and hlder domains .",
    "informally , a john domain is one in which every point can be joined to a common base - point by a  twisted cone \" with uniform vertex angle .",
    "then , again informally , a hlder domain is one in which the quasi - hyperbolic metric grows in roughly the same way that it does in a john domain .",
    "every quasi - disk is a john domain , and every john domain is a hlder domain , but these are both proper containments ( even in the simply connected setting ) .    john domains and hlder domains arise naturally in conformal dynamics , both from iteration of rational maps and from kleinian groups .",
    "for example , if @xmath6 is polynomial of degree at least @xmath7 , then all of the fatou components are john domains if and only if @xmath6 is semi - hyperbolic @xcite .",
    "an analogous statement about john domains and kleinian groups is proved in @xcite .",
    "more broadly , if @xmath8 is a rational map that satisfies the collet ",
    "eckmann expansion condition , then all fatou components are hlder domains @xcite ( and @xcite gives a partial converse to this ) .",
    "we note that the latter examples are , in some senses , typical : almost every external ray to the mandelbrot set lands on a value @xmath9 for which @xmath10 satisfies the collet ",
    "eckmann condition @xcite .",
    "hlder domains also appear in some explicitly stochastic settings , particularly those connected to @xmath11 .",
    "for example , the unbounded complementary domain of an @xmath12 trace is , almost surely , a hlder domain when @xmath13 @xcite . in a similar way ,",
    "the interior domains for the random jordan curves constructed in @xcite are , almost surely , hlder domains . here",
    "we should mention that the hlder domains appearing in these contexts are , almost surely , not john domains . at the same time , due to similarities in the behavior of the quasi - hyperbolic metric , we think of john domains as deterministic  toy examples \" of the stochastic domains .    in all three realms mentioned above ( rational dynamics , kleinian groups , and stochastic planar processes )",
    ", there are interesting questions concerning quasiconformal equivalence .",
    "when are two kleinian groups quasiconformally conjugate ?",
    "when are two julia sets quasisymmetrically equivalent ?",
    "are two independent samples of @xmath14 traces quasiconformally equivalent almost surely ?",
    "there is a significant body of work related to the first two questions ( classical results include @xcite and @xcite ; for further discussion see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.3 ) ) , and the third question was recently asked by c. mcmullen .    in light of these questions",
    ", we are motivated to study quasisymmetric invariants of the relevant objects .",
    "a prominent invariant coming from hyperbolic geometry is the conformal dimension",
    ". originally introduced by pansu @xcite to study visual boundaries of rank - one symmetric spaces , the conformal dimension can be defined for any metric space @xmath15 and is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "more accurately , we will concentrate on a related invariant , the ahlfors - regular conformal dimension , denoted @xmath17 .",
    "these have become important tools in the study of hyperbolic groups and , more generally , in the analysis of metric spaces @xcite .",
    "returning to the setting of planar domains , in this paper we focus primarily on questions related to the conformal dimension of @xmath4 , where @xmath2 is a john domain . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath2 is a quasi - disk , it follows immediately from the definitions that the conformal dimension of @xmath4 is equal to 1 . on the other hand",
    ", we suspect that the conformal dimension of boundaries of hlder domains can take any value strictly between 1 and 2 .",
    "thus , john domains seem to be the appropriate class to investigate .",
    "we will prove the following theorem .",
    "[ john1 ] if @xmath1 is a john domain with @xmath4 uniformly perfect , then @xmath18 .",
    "it is is equal to @xmath19 if and only if @xmath4 is uniformly disconnected .",
    "we should note that , in general , @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we also obtain @xmath21 , as the conformal dimension can not assume values in @xmath22 by the results in @xcite .",
    "if we assume in addition that @xmath4 is connected and not a singleton , then this gives @xmath23 .    before moving on ,",
    "let us mention a corollary that deals with the quasiconformal geometry of certain julia sets .",
    "we noted above that if @xmath6 is a semi - hyperbolic polynomial on @xmath0 of degree at least 2 , then its unbounded fatou component is a john domain @xcite .",
    "the julia set @xmath24 of @xmath25 is the boundary of this component , so theorem [ john1 ] implies the following .",
    "if @xmath6 is a semi - hyperbolic polynomial of degree at least 2 with @xmath24 connected , then @xmath26 .",
    "we note that this statement is proven in m. carrasco s phd thesis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.3 ) , using the dynamics of @xmath25 on @xmath24 .",
    "one could therefore view theorem [ john1 ] as a non - dynamical extension of this fact .    to establish theorem [ john1 ] ,",
    "we will introduce the notion of uniformly well - spread discrete cut points ( which we call the discrete uws property ) .",
    "this is a direct discretization of the notion of uniformly well - spread cut points in a metric space ( the uws property ) , which was recently introduced by m. carrasco as a sufficient condition for a compact , doubling , linearly connected metric space to have conformal dimension equal to 1 @xcite .",
    "his motivation came from boundaries of one - ended hyperbolic groups , where the linear connectivity condition is automatically satisfied ( but the boundary need not be planar ) . for us , @xmath4 is planar and , generally , is topologically uncomplicated ( namely , @xmath2 is connected ) , but linear connectivity is almost never satisfied .",
    "for example , if @xmath4 were a linearly connected jordan curve , then it would be a quasi - circle , and the conformal dimension of @xmath4 would trivially be equal to 1 . however , a simple discretization of the original uws property works well for the objects we consider .",
    "the proof of theorem [ john1 ] breaks into two parts .",
    "[ johnuws ] if @xmath1 is an @xmath27-john domain , then @xmath4 has the discrete uws property , with constant depending only on @xmath27 .",
    "[ cdim ] if @xmath28 is a compact , doubling , uniformly perfect metric space and has the discrete uws property , then @xmath29 .",
    "it is equal to @xmath19 if and only if @xmath28 is uniformly disconnected .",
    "the discrete uws property is a central ingredient in the proof of our main result .",
    "we introduce it in section [ duws ] and establish some basic properties before proving theorem [ cdim ] .",
    "in particular , we discuss its relationship to the standard uws property and its quasisymmetric invariance in the linearly connected setting .    in section [ johnsec ]",
    "we prove theorem [ johnuws ] . in many ways ,",
    "this is the heart of the paper , and we think it justifies our subsequent study of the discrete uws property . in section [ wtsec ] , we turn our attention to the infinitesimal geometry of metric spaces with the discrete uws property by studying their weak tangents .",
    "for example , we will establish the following result .",
    "[ uwsblowup ] let @xmath28 be a complete , connected , doubling metric space that has the discrete uws property with constant @xmath30 .",
    "then every weak tangent of @xmath28 has at most @xmath31 connected components , where @xmath31 depends only on @xmath30 and on the doubling constant of @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath2 is a john domain with @xmath4 connected , then every weak tangent of @xmath4 has a uniformly bounded number of connected components ( theorem [ wtjohn ] ) .",
    "one should compare this to the following asymptotic characterization of quasi - circles : a jordan curve is a quasi - circle if and only if every weak tangent is connected ( see theorem [ metriccircle ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ holdersec ] , we discuss some problems related to the conformal dimension of boundaries of hlder domains .",
    "we give an example of a hlder domain in @xmath32 whose boundary has hausdorff dimension equal to 1 but ahlfors - regular conformal dimension equal to 2 .",
    "we end with some questions about whether this behavior is typical for the complementary components of @xmath11 traces .",
    "the author thanks mario bonk for many good discussions about the topics that appear in this paper .",
    "in particular , theorem [ metriccircle ] was motivated by a question of his , and lemma [ hops ] grew out of his suggested approach to that question .",
    "this provided the kernel from which the other arguments and results in this paper eventually grew .",
    "additional thanks go to steffen rhode and huy tran for helpful discussions about trees and @xmath11 curves , to hrant hakobyan , john mackay , jeremy tyson , and dimitrios ntalampekos for feedback on an earlier version of this paper , and to the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions .",
    "let us recall some standard notation and definitions in metric geometry .",
    "a metric space @xmath15 is doubling if there is a constant @xmath30 for which every ball in @xmath28 of radius @xmath33 can be covered by at most @xmath30 balls of radius @xmath34 .",
    "note that a doubling metric space is totally bounded , so every complete and doubling metric space is proper : closed balls are compact .",
    "we say that @xmath28 is uniformly perfect if there is @xmath35 such that the closed annulus @xmath36 for each @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "for example , if @xmath28 is connected and has at least two points , then it is uniformly perfect .",
    "a much stronger condition is linear connectivity . for @xmath39",
    ", we say that @xmath28 is @xmath40-linearly connected if for any two points @xmath41 there is a compact connected set @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    following standard notation",
    ", we will use @xmath45 to denote the hausdorff dimension of @xmath28 . for @xmath46 , the metric space @xmath28",
    "is said to be ahlfors @xmath47-regular if it supports a borel regular measure @xmath48 such that @xmath49 for all balls in @xmath28 of radius @xmath50 , where @xmath30 is a uniform constant . in this case , @xmath51 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that an ahlfors regular metric space is necessarily doubling and uniformly perfect .",
    "a finite sequence of points @xmath52 in @xmath28 is called a discrete @xmath53-path if @xmath54 for each @xmath55 . abusing standard terminology , we say that such a discrete path joins @xmath56 and @xmath57 . the metric space",
    "@xmath28 is uniformly disconnected if there is @xmath58 such that , for each @xmath41 distinct , there is no discrete @xmath59-path joining @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "now , we turn our attention to sets in the riemann sphere . when working in this setting",
    ", we will always use the spherical metric on @xmath0 , though on occasion we will still denote it by @xmath62 . let @xmath1 be a domain . for @xmath63 ,",
    "let @xmath64 be the distance from @xmath65 to the boundary of @xmath2 , measured of course in the spherical metric . if @xmath66 is an arc in @xmath2 , we will use @xmath67 $ ] to denote the closed sub - arc joining two points @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 be an arc with endpoints @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and let @xmath72 .",

    "often we refer to the other endpoint , @xmath71 , as the tip of @xmath66 .",
    "geometrically , a john arc is the core of a twisted cone in @xmath2 , namely the union of all balls @xmath75)/l)$ ] for @xmath74 .",
    "a domain @xmath1 is called an @xmath27-john domain if there is @xmath76 such that every @xmath63 can be joined to @xmath70 by an @xmath27-john arc with base - point @xmath70 and tip @xmath65 .    if @xmath2 is a john domain with respect to some base - point , then it is also a john domain with respect to any other base - point , although the constant may change .",
    "the john condition functions , in some ways , as a one - sided quasi - disk condition .",
    "for example , if @xmath4 is a jordan curve and both complementary components are john domains , then @xmath4 is a quasi - circle ( and the complementary components are , in fact , quasi - disks ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9.3 ) .",
    "more generally , a simply connected domain @xmath1 is a john domain if and only if @xmath77 is linearly connected ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.5 ) .",
    "the main idea behind these properties is that john domains may have inward - pointing spikes and bubbles but not outward - pointing ones .    a more general class of domains are the hlder domains , which verify a logarithmic growth condition on the quasi - hyperbolic metric .",
    "namely , for @xmath78 , the quasi - hyperbolic distance is @xmath79 where the infimum is taken over rectifiable paths in @xmath2 that join @xmath65 and @xmath80 .",
    "once again , we remark that distances are computed in the spherical metric .",
    "this defines a complete metric on @xmath2 as long as @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , @xmath82 is bi - lipschitz equivalent to the hyperbolic metric on @xmath2 whenever @xmath2 is simply connected .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is a hlder domain if there is a base - point @xmath76 and constants @xmath83 such that @xmath84 for each @xmath63 .",
    "this condition is also independent of the base - point , although the constants may differ .",
    "it is not difficult to show that every john domain is a hlder domain , but the converse is not true .",
    "when @xmath2 is simply connected ( and not equal to @xmath0 or @xmath32 ) , the hlder condition is equivalent to hlder continuity of the conformal map @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "every quasi - disk is a john domain and , therefore , is also a hlder domain .",
    "an important difficulty that we will face in this paper is that boundaries of john domains , unlike boundaries of quasi - disks , need not be linearly connected ( again , the john condition allows for inward - pointing cusps ) .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath86 be metric spaces .",
    "a homeomorphism @xmath87 is quasisymmetric if there is a control function @xmath88 , i.e. , an increasing homeomorphism , such that @xmath89 for all distinct points @xmath90 .",
    "we should remark that the inverse of a quasisymmetric map is quasisymmetric with control function @xmath91 . in the case",
    "that @xmath92 , the class of quasisymmetric maps is precisely the class of quasiconformal maps , in any of the standard definitions of quasiconformal . for our purposes , one can simply take this to be the definition of a quasiconformal homeomorphism of @xmath0 .",
    "given a complete and doubling metric space @xmath15 , we use @xmath93 to denote the conformal gauge of @xmath28 : the set of all ( isomorphism classes of ) metric spaces @xmath94 that are quasisymmetrically equivalent to @xmath28 .",
    "obviously , @xmath95 , so the conformal gauge is always non - empty .",

    "* corollary 3.7 ) and the subsequent remarks ) . a detailed proof by carrasco can be found in @xcite ; our notation closely follows his .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath139 is essentially a combinatorial quantity : it is calculated by solving a modulus problem on graph approximations to the underlying metric space @xmath28 . however",
    ", the vertex paths in these graph approximations might look very different from paths in @xmath28 .",
    "for example , the vertex paths in @xmath118 might  jump \" between connected components of @xmath140 , thereby giving vertex paths that do not correspond to actual paths in @xmath28 .",

    "indeed , every point in @xmath2 can be joined to the midpoint of the unit square by a john arc ( with uniform constant ) , except for the points that lie between two consecutive spokes in some @xmath752 .",
    "if @xmath65 is one of these latter points , then we observe the following .",
    "first , there is a john arc in @xmath2 from @xmath65 to a point @xmath71 which has @xmath757 .",
    "then there is an arc in @xmath2 from @xmath71 to a point @xmath758 , where @xmath758 is in the the uniform john region in @xmath2 , that has length at most @xmath759 and lies at distance @xmath760 from @xmath28 .",
    "it is straightforward to estimate the quasi - hyperbolic length of the first segment by @xmath761 and the second segment by @xmath762 , where @xmath30 is uniform . using a john arc ( with uniform constant ) from @xmath758 to the midpoint of the unit square , which has quasi - hyperbolic length at most @xmath763",
    ", we see that the quasi - hyperbolic distance from @xmath65 to the midpoint is @xmath764 .",
    "note that @xmath28 has hausdorff dimension 1 , so @xmath765 .",
    "we claim now that @xmath766 .",
    "the estimate @xmath767 comes from the fact that @xmath28 is a subset of the plane ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 14.17 ) . for the other inequality ,",
    "we verify a lower bound on combinatorial modulus . to this",
    "end , fix @xmath768 . for each @xmath114 , let @xmath115 be an @xmath116-separated set in @xmath28 with @xmath769 .",
    "fix @xmath113 , and let @xmath118 be the graph with vertex set @xmath115 , where @xmath119 are joined by an edge if @xmath770 .",
    "we should note that balls are taken to be in @xmath28 , not in the plane .",
    "fix @xmath114 very large and let @xmath167 be the largest integer for which @xmath771 . consider the family @xmath772 of vertex paths in @xmath124 that join @xmath773 to @xmath774 .",
    "let @xmath775 denote the spokes in @xmath776 , which are line segments from @xmath777 to @xmath778 .",
    "note that the distance between any two spokes is at least @xmath779 and , so also , at least @xmath780 . for each @xmath182",
    ", there is a vertex path @xmath781 in @xmath772 consisting of vertices that lie on @xmath171 .",
    "the paths @xmath781 are pairwise vertex disjoint and @xmath782 with uniform constants .",
    "suppose that @xmath783 $ ] is an admissible weight function for @xmath772 .",
    "then for each @xmath182 , we have @xmath784 so that @xmath785 consequently , we can estimate @xmath786 and therefore @xmath787 . using the notation from before , we conclude that @xmath788 so @xmath789 .",
    "as @xmath790 was arbitrary , we obtain @xmath791 .",
    "one could also establish @xmath792 in the following way , without explicit modulus estimates .",
    "namely , let @xmath793 denote the conformal assouad dimension of @xmath28 , which is an a priori lower bound for @xmath17 ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.2 ) for definitions .",
    "it is known that the conformal assouad dimension does not increase under taking weak tangents ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6.1.7 ) , and it is bounded below by the topological dimension .",
    "now , observe that the sequence @xmath794 gives a weak tangent @xmath94 of @xmath28 that contains an isometric copy of the planar quarter annulus with inner radius 1 and outer radius 2 .",
    "thus , @xmath795 i thank the referee for pointing out this alternative argument .",
    "this example shows that the conformal dimension and the ahlfors - regular conformal dimension can be very different , even for jordan curves that bound a simply connected hlder domain .",
    "in fact , we expect this to happen generically for hlder domains that come from @xmath11 process .",
    "more concretely , we ask the following question ."
