    "-0.2 cm atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments present today compelling evidence of neutrino flavor oscillations induced , respectively , by the mass squared differences @xmath4  ev@xmath1  @xcite and @xmath5  ev@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "these results have been independently supported by the k2k experiment  @xcite , confirming the @xmath6 conversion observed in atmospheric neutrino data , and by the kamland experiment  @xcite , recently observing @xmath7 disappearance compatible with what has been seen by the solar neutrino experiments .    in the standard three neutrino flavor oscillation framework ,",
    "the above results imply neutrino oscillation lengths at energies above about 0.3  tev much greater than the earth s diameter , strongly suppressing @xmath8 and @xmath9 oscillations . moreover , the ratio between @xmath10 and @xmath6 atmospheric fluxes drops as their energy increases so that atmospheric neutrino data above 0.5 tev are expected to be basically composed of @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the so called prompt atmospheric neutrinos coming from the decay of charmed particles as well as extra - galactic @xmath13 contributions are very small compared to the conventional atmospheric @xmath6 fluxes ( which mainly come from the decay of charged pions and kaons ) in the 0.5 - 10 tev energy range  @xcite .    however , as we will see , atmospheric @xmath14 fluxes in the tev energy range can be non - negligible compared to the @xmath6 if the result of lsnd experiment  @xcite which indicates @xmath15 transition generated by neutrino oscillations with a large mass scale , @xmath16 ev@xmath1 , turns out to be correct",
    ". the lsnd result , which will be very soon tested by the miniboone experiment  @xcite , if confirmed , can be interpreted in combination with the atmospheric and solar neutrino data as a signature of an additional neutrino , @xmath17 , sterile in nature .",
    "the minimum scheme necessary to explain at same time all three indications of neutrino oscillations involves four neutrino mass eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "we are aware that current analyses performed with the entire set of neutrino data from accelerators , reactors , solar and atmospheric neutrinos seem to disfavor four neutrino mass scenarios  @xcite .",
    "see , however , refs .",
    "@xcite which casted doubt on conclusions drawn in refs .",
    "more importantly , no experiment until now has confirmed or ruled out the lsnd result and one should wait for results from miniboone .",
    "we will show in this letter that in the framework of four neutrino mass schemes , atmospheric neutrino data at the tev energy scale may contain a non negligible amount of @xmath18 or @xmath19 , due to the interplay of the earth matter with the lsnd mass scale through the so called msw effect  @xcite , and of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , due to almost vacuum oscillations induced by this same mass scale . to our knowledge",
    "it has been never mentioned before in the literature that the lsnd mass splitting could give rise to resonant @xmath22 or @xmath23 conversion for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "these @xmath24 events can be observed by a large neutrino telescope , such as the proposed icecube detector  @xcite , by measuring the angular distribution of upward - going muons and cascade events .",
    "this is because the zenithal dependence of upward - going muons as well as of cascade events will be modified by these new contributions with respect to what would be expected for the standard three neutrino oscillation framework .",
    "the zenithal distortions can not only discriminate among the different types of four neutrino mass schemes , but also they are sensitive to the sign of the lsnd mass splitting , opening a new window to test four neutrino mass scenarios .",
    "-0.2 cm we will work in the minimal model structure needed to describe the three evidence for neutrino oscillations ( atmospheric , solar and lsnd ) : a four neutrino mass scheme  @xcite .",
    "we will adopt the same parametrization and some useful notations used in refs  @xcite . for what concerns us here , the sign of @xmath25 and of @xmath26 are irrelevant , only the sign of @xmath27 will be significant .",
    "we can then classify the possible four neutrino mass schemes into two categories : ( a ) _ ( 3 + 1 ) _ , when a single neutrino mass state is separated from the other neutrino mass states by a large mass splitting ( @xmath28 ) ; and ( b ) _ ( 2 + 2 ) _ , when two pairs of neutrino mass states are separated by a gap given by the @xmath28 scale .",

    "the increase of the number of cascade events in the _ ( 3 + 1 ) _ schemes is almost exclusively due to @xmath20 appearance .",
    "in fact , the angular distribution of cascade events reflect the flavor content of the atmospheric neutrino flux as measured at the detector site .",
    "we observe that cascade events are more effective in separating the mass hierarchy of four neutrino schemes than the upward - going muon events .",
    "this is not surprising since the 500 gev energy cut imposed on the cascade showers selects events closer to the resonant energy where the effect of the large @xmath96 ev@xmath1 is more sizable . for higher values of @xmath199",
    "the differences among the standard and the four neutrino oscillations distributions could be even larger than what we have shown in figs .",

    "we note that unlike the case of upward - going muon events , cascade events can be observed also for @xmath200 , which correspond to down - going events .",
    "for such events , for any four neutrino mass scheme we have considered here , we do not expect any significant deviation of the zenith angle distribution from what is expected in the standard three neutrino oscillation scheme . in the standard scheme , in good approximation ,",
    "the zenith angle distribution is symmetric with respect to @xmath201 .",
    "this is because of the fact that for down - going cascade events , there is no matter effect and the distance traveled by neutrinos is much smaller than the typical oscillation length expected for @xmath28 scale and @xmath202 tev so that no significant @xmath203 induced events are expected .",
    "therefore , by comparing the zenith distributions for @xmath204 and @xmath205 , it is expected that we can discriminate four neutrino mass schemes from the standard three one with better sensitivity .",
    "finally , let us note that the uncertainty in the prediction of the atmospheric muon neutrino flux , which is currently about 15% , could potentially spoil the discriminating power among the different signals .",
    "this can be , to some extent , overcome by combining cascade and upward - going muon events , and so reducing the uncertainty in the overall flux . also , the shape of the event distributions , here the key point in disentangling the different signals , is not very much affected by the overall flux normalization .",

    "we have shown that upward - going muon events as well as cascade events , that can be measured by a kilometer scale detector such as the one proposed by the icecube collaboration , can indicate the presence of the fourth neutrino through the production of @xmath208 and @xmath209 which are not expected in the standard three generation oscillation case where we have only the small mass splittings @xmath65 and @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore the zenithal dependence of cascade events is even sensitive to the sign of @xmath27 because the matter effect play an important rle , leading to resonant @xmath22 or @xmath210 conversion depending on the sign of @xmath27 .",
    "we note that the standard three generation oscillation scheme can not induce these signals of @xmath18/@xmath20 appearance at the 1 tev scale , and therefore , they constitute an unique signature of a large mass scale present in a four neutrino mass scheme .    a final remark .",
    "if miniboone observes a positive signal , the effects shown here should be expected independent of the four neutrino mass scheme . on the other hand ,",
    "if miniboone results turns out to be negative this may be viewed as a complementary test of the presence of a large neutrino mass splitting in nature .",

    "<S> we show in this paper that the observation of the angular distribution of upward - going muons and cascade events induced by atmospheric neutrinos at the tev energy scale , which can be performed by a kilometer - scale neutrino telescope , such as the icecube detector , can be used to probe a large neutrino mass splitting , @xmath0  ev@xmath1 , implied by the lsnd experiment and discriminate among four neutrino mass schemes . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that such a large mass scale can promote non negligible @xmath2/@xmath3 conversions at these energies by the msw effect as well as vacuum oscillation , unlike what is expected if all the neutrino mass splittings are small . </S>"
