    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been established after the discovery of the @xmath3 higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , there are still remaining puzzles which are not addressed in the sm .",
    "in particular , the smallness of the neutrino masses measured by the neutrino - oscillation experiments  @xcite and the existence of the cosmic dark matter ( dm ) inferred from the astronomical observations  @xcite are phenomenologically important issues . the simplest solution to explain the tiny neutrino masses",
    "is the canonical seesaw mechanism with super - heavy right - handed neutrinos  @xcite , while its verification by experiments may be difficult . on the other hand , various dm candidates - such as the axion , weakly interacting massive particles , asymmetric dm , strongly interacting massive particles and wimpzilla -",
    "have been suggested .",
    "however , the scale of the dm mass is unknown and spreads over a very wide range from @xmath4 to @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "models with a radiative neutrino mechanism are among the most economical scenarios which can resolve the above two issues at the same time . in this class of models ,",
    "the neutrino mass is induced by quantum effects , while the dm candidate is incorporated as a necessary component .",
    "since the dm particle is running in the quantum loop diagram in order to generate the neutrino masses , the phenomenology of neutrinos and that of dm are strongly correlated .",
    "representative models possessing these ingredients include ma s scotogenic models at the one - loop  @xcite , and the two - loop level  @xcite , the krauss - nasri - trodden ( knt ) model at the three - loop level  @xcite , and other three - loop models proposed by aoki , kanemura , and seto  @xcite , and by gustafsson , no , and rivera  @xcite . in each of these models , an _ ad hoc _",
    "discrete symmetry @xmath6 or @xmath7 is imposed not only to forbid the tree - level neutrino yukawa interactions , but also to guarantee the dm stability .",
    "the origin of the discrete symmetry is left unknown .",
    "a possible origin of this symmetry is an accidental symmetry .",
    "if one extends the sm with higher - dimensional su(2)@xmath8 representations such as quintets or septets , an accidental @xmath6 symmetry appears in a new particle sector and stabilizes the dm candidate  @xcite .",
    "extensions of the models with radiative neutrino mass generation along this line and their phenomenology have been explored in refs .",
    "another attractive idea for the dark matter stability is that the discrete symmetry originates from a continuous symmetry which is spontaneously broken at some high energy scale by a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of scalar fields .",
    "if the continuous symmetry is the gauge symmetry , this mechanism is known as the krauss - wilczek mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been applied to the radiative seesaw models  @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry can also leave a @xmath9 symmetry , which is well known as the domain wall production in axion models .",
