    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) represent the final product of the interaction between a slow and dense stellar wind that originates from an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star , and a subsequent , faster and tenuous wind expelled between the very late agb phase and at the beginning of the post  agb phase .",
    "the interaction between these two stellar winds results in the formation of a pn ( interacting stellar wind model ; kwok et al . 1978 ) .",
    "this model can adequately explain the formation of spherically symmetric pne .",
    "nevertheless , the majority of pne and proto  pne show asymmetric and complex morphologies ( boumis et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; parker et al . 2006 ; manchado et al . 2011 ; sahai et al .",
    "2011 ; sabin et al .",
    "2014 ) that can not be explained by the isw model . as a consequence ,",
    "the development of a more general picture , which employs an axisymmetric equatorial density enhancement in the agb wind ( generalized isw ; see balick & frank 2002 ) , has been established as the standard model to explain the formation of non  spherically symmetric pne .",
    "the formation mechanism for the equatorial density enhancement in the agb wind is , however , still poorly understood .",
    "the most likely mechanisms are ( i ) the presence of magnetic fields ( chevalier & luo 1994 ; garca  segura & lpez 2000 ; frank & blackman 2004 ; vlemmings 2012 ) or ( ii ) the interaction of a close binary nucleus during the post  common envelope phase ( iben & livio 1993 ; soker & livio 1994 ; soker & rappaport 2001 ; jones et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the magnetic fields alone may not be unable to provide sufficient angular momentum needed to form aspherical pne ( soker 2006 , nordhaus & blackman 2007 , garca ",
    "segura et al . 2014 ) . on other hand",
    ", only a small number of pne have been found to host a close binary nucleus ( @xmath050 ; see jones et al .",
    "2015 and references therein ) , which conflicts with the number of known aspherical pne ( de marco 2009 , miszalski et al .",
    "2011a , b ) . moreover",
    ", the number of @xmath050 pne with close binary nucleus corresponds to a small percentage of the total number of known pne in our galaxy ( @xmath03500 ; e.g. kwitter et al .",
    "2014 ; sabin et al . 2014 . in order to address this question , bipolar planetary nebulae that exhibit extreme or unusual properties can be investigated , and if these sources can be understood they will help in resolving the question of the shaping mechanism for pne .",
    "the motivation for this work comes from the noticeable differences between the optical spectra ( emission line intensities ) and the chemical abundances of the pn abell  14 or pn  a66  14 ( abell 1966 ) derived by bohigas 2003 ( hereafter b03 ) and henry et al .",
    "2010 ( hereafter h10 ) , as well as its classification as a possible born  again nebula by de marco ( 2009 ) .",
    "we performed a morpho  kinematical study of abell  14 by means of high  dispersion , long ",
    "slit spectra and the the astronomical code shape ( steffen & lpez 2006 , steffen et al .",
    "2011 ) in order to construct the 3d structure of the nebula .",
    "the 3d density distribution from our best ",
    "fit shape model was used as an input to the 3d photo  ionization code mocassin ( ercolano et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 , 2008 ) in order to perform a more detailed study of its ionization structure and derive the fundamental physical parameters of the central source and the nebula .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section  2 , we present a detailed description of abell  14 .",
    "the observations and data reduction procedures are presented in section  3 . in section  4",
    ", we present the results from the 3d analysis of abell  14 , and describe our 3d modelling with the codes shape and mocassin .",
    "our morpho ",
    "kinematic and physico  chemical results are discussed in section  5 .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section  6 .",
    "the central star of abell  14 has been classified as a massive blue giant b5 iii ",
    "v ( @xmath5=15.24 and @xmath6=0.51 ) by lutz & kaler ( 1987 ) and more recently as a b89 star by weidmann & gamen ( 2011 ) .",
    "interestingly , these observational results do not agree with the stellar properties derived by studying the properties of its surrounding nebula ( b03 ) .",
    "in particular , the author has found that the central star of abell  14 should be a hot star with a zanstra temperature of 150,000  k and a low visual magnitude of @xmath7=22.9@xmath8 , using the formula given in jacoby & kaler ( 1989 ) for optically thick pne , despite abell  14 is an optically thin pn .",
    "this suggests that the central star of abell  14 may be a binary system containing a hot , faint companion and a type b giant star .",
    "according to the evolutionary models from vassiliadis & wood ( 1994 ) and blcker ( 1995 ) , b03 estimated the initial mass of the progenitor star to be between 2.5 and 3  @xmath1 , with an evolutionary age of @xmath08,000  yr .",
    "b03 and h10 studied the chemical properties of abell  14 , and there are notable differences between the two studies . in particular , the intensities of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath9 emission lines from h10 are @xmath01.6 times larger than those from b03 .",
    "the [ o  i ]  @xmath10 line is detected by h10 with [ o  i]/h@xmath11=30 , while it is not found by b03 despite the detection of the fainter he  i  @xmath12 line ( he  i / h@xmath11=15.6 ) .",
    "the [ n  i ]  @xmath13 line , which could be associated with strong shock interactions , is detected by b03 but not by h10 .",
    "the logarithmic dereddened h@xmath11  fluxes are also slightly different between the two studies : @xmath14(h@xmath11)=@xmath15 ( b03 ) and @xmath1614.82 ( h10 ) .",
    "these differences may be related to the slit positions where the spectra were obtained : along the north  south direction ( pa=0@xmath17 ; b03 ) , and along the east  west direction ( pa=100@xmath17 ; h10 ) .",
    "more recently , frew et al .",
    "( 2013 ) published a total integrated h@xmath4  flux of @xmath18 , which is close to the value of @xmath1612.27 quoted by b03 .    regarding the chemical abundances , h10 calculated higher he , n , and o than those derived in b03 by factors of 1.25 , 2.7 , and 1.95 , respectively , and lower s and ar abundances by factors of 0.34 and 0.68 , respectively",
    "however , both studies agree that abell  14 is an extremely nitrogen  rich nebula with @xmath19 ( b03 ) and 0.62 ( h10 ) . a similarly high n / o",
    "abundance ratio has been found in highly evolved bipolar pne such as pn  g321.6 + 02.2 ( corradi et al .",
    "1997 ) , hatr  10 ( tajitsu et al . 1999 ) , rcw  24 and rcw  69 ( frew et al .",
    "2006 ) , and pn  g342.0 - 01.7 ( ali et al . 2015 ) .",
    "each of these pne exhibits very low electron density ( @xmath20 ) and very hot , optically faint central star , like that of abell  14 .",
    "the connection of these pne with abell  14 is discussed in   6",
    ".    .observation log [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath21 the stellar parameters have been derived from photo  ionization models .",
    "+ @xmath22 these kinematical ages have been calculated by us , assuming a nominal expansion velocity of 40  .",
    "+ @xmath23 a possible born  again pn .",
    "+    the 3d density distribution grid , derived using shape , was used as an input to the mocassin code in order to perform a more comprehensive study of its ionization structure .",
    "two available spectra from the literature were used to constrain the models .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this technique of deriving independent density grids has also been applied to ngc  1501 by ercolano et al .",
    "( 2004 ) using a density grid derived from long - slit echellograms as an input to mocassin and also to ngc  40 by monteiro and falceta - gonalves ( 2011 ) , using a density distribution derived from 2.5d hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "two models were run with the chemical abundances as free parameters and assuming a stellar model atmosphere ( mod3 ) and a hydrogen - deficient , pg  1159 stellar atmosphere model ( mod4 ) for the central source .",
    "both models adequately reproduced the majority of the emission lines ( table  2 ) for a distance of 4  kpc . the stellar parameters ( @xmath24 = @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27  kk ) indicate a highly evolved central star near to the cooling track of wds . in accordance with the theoretical hydrogen - burning evolutionary track of vassiliadis and wood ( 1994 )",
    ", the central star has an evolutionary age of @xmath085,000  yr ( for @xmath28 and z = 0.08 ) , which is several times higher than the kinematical age of the nebula ( @xmath019,400  yr ) .",
    "nevertheless , this discrepancy is a common problem in evolved pne with highly evolved central stars ( e.g. pea et al .",
    "a possible solution is the interaction between two binary components that would accelerate the evolution of the system ( iben and tutukov 1986 ) .",
    "given that the star at the centre of the nebula has been classified as a b  type massive blue giant ( b5 iii  v , lutz & kaler 1987 ; b8 - 9 , weidmann & gamen 2011 ) , the presence of a binary system in abell  14 is very possible . the helium  burning evolutionary track ( very late thermal pulse ) gives for the aforementioned stellar parameters an extremely high evolutionary age , that is between 200,000300,000  yr .",
    "this age is 3 - 4 times larger than the evolutionary age based on hydrogen - burning tracks and at least 10 times larger than the kinematical age of the nebular gas .",
    "notice that suwt  2 , a likely born - again nebula ( danehkar et al .",
    "2013 ) , is one of the oldest member in our sample of he - pne , based on its kinematical age , but at the same time it is the most luminous .",
    "this indicates that the central star of suwt  2 is in an earlier evolutionary stage than all other members ( see table 4 ) .",
    "according to this analysis , abell  14 s stellar parameters ( @xmath24 = @xmath25 , @xmath27  kk ) and its kinematical age ( @xmath019,400  yr ) can not be explained by the born - again scenario , which should result in a much older nebula , for the given stellar parameters .",
    "our two best  fit models and the observed spectra agree that there is significant he and n abundance enrichment in abell  14 . based on the kingsburgh and barlow ( 1994 ) classification scheme ,",
    "abell  14 is an extreme type ",
    "i highly evolved nebula and probably one with the largest he abundance and n / o ratio .",
    "these values are consistent with a 5  @xmath1 progenitor derived from the evolutionary tracks .",
    "until now , only a small number of studies have been performed on highly evolved type ",
    "i pne ( see tables 3 & 4 ) .",
    "all pne in this group show substantially high n / o ratios and he abundances whilst their central stars have very low @xmath24 and high @xmath29 , and they are possible descendants of intermediate - mass stars in close binaries . only the central star of suwt  2 has a high luminosity of @xmath30 and a large kinematical age ( danehkar et al .",
    "2013 ) , due to a likely very late thermal pulse ( born  again scenario ) .",
    "moreover , while most he  pne show n / o ratio larger than 1 ( n rich ) , suwt  2 has an n / o = 0.8 which makes it somewhat different .",
    "most of the he  pne in our group ( tables 3 and 4 ) lie in the low - left corner of the pne regime on the h@xmath4/[n  ii ]  vs. h@xmath4/[s  ii ]  diagnostic diagram ( sabbadin et al . 1977 ; gonalves et al . 2003 ) of galactic pne ( fig .",
    "akras & gonalves ( 2016 ) have recently demonstrated that in this regime also lie shock  excited regions , e.g. low  ionization structures such as knots and jets . since these pne do not exhibit high velocities , the scenario of shocks in such large and he ",
    "pne seems unlikely .",
    "interestingly , some he  pne exhibit uncommonly bright [ n  i ]  @xmath13 and [ o  i ]  @xmath3 emission lines , which are strong indicators of shock activity .",
    "recently , ali et al .",
    "( 2015 ) showed that a reverse shock of only 25  in the pn g342.001.7 , due to its motion through the ism , can successfully explain the strong neutral emission lines .",
    "the low photo",
    " ionization rate of their central stars , ( very low @xmath24 ) and large nebular size , would make the contribution of shocks easily perceptible even at small velocities ( akras & gonalves 2016 ) , or produce emission line spectra that resemble those of shock - excited regions ( raga et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "three out of 11 he  pne are seen to exist outside the normal region in fig .",
    "9 , namely sbw  1 , eso  166pn  21 , and webo  1 .",
    "sbw  1 and webo  1 are the youngest members in this group , and their central stars are such luminous that their high photo - ionization rate overcomes the shock excitation .",
    "unfortunately , the stellar parameters of these he  pne are still unknown . regarding eso  166pn  21 , the [ n  ii]/h@xmath4  and [ s  ii]/h@xmath4  line ratios correspond to an average value from 7 slit positions ( for more details see in pea et al .",
    "1997 ) . studying the spectrum of each slit position separately",
    ", we deduce that the most distant regions ( a1 and a5 in pea et al .",
    "1997 ) exhibit stronger [ n  ii ]  and [ s  ii ]  lines .",
    "two out of 7 regions in eso  166pn  21 lie in the regime of he  pne .",
    "this is in agreement with our previous analysis that the lower the photo - ionization rate , the stronger the low  emission lines ( raga et al .",
    "2008 , akras & gonalves 2016 ) .",
    "the first detailed study of the 3d morphology and ionization structure of abell  14 has been discussed in this paper .",
    "the kinematical and physical parameters of this nebula , as well as the stellar parameters of its central source have been derived using new high - dispersion spectroscopic data and high - resolution images , as well as the 3d codes shape and mocassin .",
    "the resultant modelled 3d density distribution obtained from shape has been used as an input to the mocassin code . to successfully create a photo - ionization model using the proposed technique ( shape + mocassin ) , at least two emission lines ( e.g. [ n  ii ]  and [ o  iii ] ) are required to constrain the morphology of the inner and outer parts , while obtaining a 3d density distribution that best describes the entire nebula .",
    "abell  14 was found to be a highly evolved ( 19,400  yr ) , type ",
    "i pn ( 11.20 @xmath31 he @xmath31 11.29 , and 2.63 @xmath31 n / o @xmath31 4.03 ) formed by an intermediate - mass progenitor of 5  @xmath1 , which it has likely experienced the tdu and hbb , resulting in a substantial enrichment of he and n. the abundance of o is found to be sub  solar , indicating that large amounts have been converted to n. the synthetic pv diagrams and 2d image from the shape code at different orientations resemble the structure of webo  1 and suwt  2 , thus suggesting that these are objects with similar morphologies observed from different angles .",
    "the binary companion of the central star in webo  1 and suwt  2 has already been confirmed , but not for the central source in abell  14 .",
    "the bright star at the centre of abell  14 has been classified as a massive blue - giant ; but such star is not hot enough to ionize the surrounding gas , making a second , hotter companion probable . our best ",
    "fit ionization models adequately reproduced the observed spectra for a central source with @xmath27  kk and @xmath32 .",
    "these stellar parameters can not be explained by the born - again scenario within an evolutionary timescale of @xmath085,000  yr ( hydrogen burning timescale ) .",
    "the central star of abell  14 is in a more evolved evolutionary phase than that of suwt  2 , a likely born - again nebula . while it is surrounded by a younger nebula ( lower kinematical age ) .",
    "this implies that the central star of abell  14 has not experienced any very late thermal pulse event .",
    "returning to the shaping mechanisms of bipolar planetary nebulae , this study indicates that a highly evolved , low luminosity and intermediate mass progenitor , within a binary system is responsible for the distinctive double - ringed structure and peculiar spectrum observed in abell 14 .",
    "abell  14 also shows unexpectedly strong [ o  i ]  @xmath3 and [ n  i ]  @xmath13 emission lines that are not reproducible by our photo  ionization models .",
    "this indicates that shock interactions may play an important role .",
    "the very low luminosity of its central star , in conjunction with the nebula s large size , imply a very low photo  ionization rate that makes the contribution of shocks easily perceptible .",
    "regarding its [ n  ii]/h@xmath4  and [ s  ii]/h@xmath4  line ratios , abell  14 seems to have some similarities with supernova remnants , but it is more closely related to other he - pne .    of all he ",
    "pne discussed here , 8 out of 11 exhibit strong neutral [ o  i ]  @xmath3 line , likely associated with shocks , 6 out of 7 have central stars with @xmath33 , and are therefore at a very evolved stage near the wd cooling track with very low photo - ionization rates .",
    "we argue that any shock interaction due to stellar winds , or interaction between the nebula and the surrounding ism ( e.g. g342.0 - 01.7 ) may be the main reason for the enhancement of the low - ionization lines .",
