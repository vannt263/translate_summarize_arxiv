    "zinc oxide is a prominent example of an intrinsically n - type semiconductor .",
    "its abundant availability , its low - cost production , and its wide electronic band gap of approximately 3.4 ev make zno attractive for transparent and conducting oxide layers in consumer - electronics devices . however , a break - through of zno - based transparent electronics has not been achieved so far due to the lack of sufficiently conductive and long - term stable zno layers .",
    "the problem of p - type doping of zno has by now been a scientific challenge for more than two decades . besides the doping with single elements like n , p , as , or sb , substituting o and li ,",
    "na , k , cu , ag or au , substituting zn@xcite co - doping was discussed as well.@xcite apparently , the most promising candidate so far is still nitrogen .",
    "however , it was shown theoretically@xcite that the substitutional defect of n on o sites ( n@xmath2 ) can not be responsible for the p - type conduction which has been observed in some experiments,@xcite since it creates a defect level which is located too high above the valence band ( vb ) edge with respect to thermal excitation energies .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental studies consider more complicated defect complexes which involve zinc vacancies ( v@xmath4 ) or co - doping , like the n@xmath2-v@xmath4 or n@xmath2-v@xmath4-h defect complexes , as potential sources of p - type conduction.@xcite    for polycrystalline zno it has been proposed that conduction channels of p - type can be found along grain boundaries.@xcite here it is an interplay of grain boundaries , their depletion regions , and point defects that results in the desired low lying acceptor levels .",
    "it has been reported by hierro et al.@xcite that the use of ternary zno - based alloys like zn@xmath0mg@xmath1o ( denoted by zmo in the following ) facilitates the p - type conductivity due to lower net electron concentrations than in pure zno .",
    "these authors relate the reduced net electron concentration to two deep lying mg - related defects which act as electron traps .",
    "zmo retains the wurtzite crystal structure of zno for mg substituting zn for concentrations up to @xmath5 , and also the lattice parameters change only slightly . hence combining zmo with n - type zno layers",
    "leads to negligible lattice misfits.@xcite    up to now it is not yet clear which atomic or extended defects provide the key to promote p - type conductivity in zno and related materials like zmo .",
    "an understanding of this defect physics would allow a targeted development of experimental routes to synthesize materials having these particular acceptor states .",
    "in this paper we present a density functional theory ( dft ) study determining the electronic defect levels of the defects n@xmath2 , v@xmath4 , and n@xmath2-v@xmath4 in zno and zmo .",
    "we discuss our results in the context of the accumulated experimental and theoretical knowledge , and thereby we shed light on the question of why some experimental routes recently taken have lead to p - conduction but others not .",
    "are the defect states that originate from n@xmath2 indeed too deep@xcite in the band gap ? what changes when n@xmath2 forms a defect complex with a zn vacancy , and how do mg atoms nearby affect its defect level position ? for the determination of the electronic defect levels we use a self - interaction corrected ( sic ) local - density approximation ( lda ) approach@xcite that is capable to give far better results than both commonly used approximations , the lda and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the latter two have limited predictive power for wide band gap semiconductors due to their inherent significant underestimation of the band gap due to their self - interaction error .",
    "lda overcomes this limitation and yields electronic band structures with band gaps that are in good agreement with experiment@xcite and in particular for zno a correct separation of the zn-3d and o-2p bands.@xcite by means of this approach , the defect levels in various amorphous oxide semiconductors based on in , sn , and zn have been predicted reliably.@xcite    the results presented in this paper may solve the controversial problem that individual n@xmath2 defects are indeed creating levels lying too deep inside the band gap even though nitrogen doping has been observed to lead to p - type zno and zmo , probably due to an interplay with other defects .",
    "moreover , we relate our present results to the p - type conduction effects which have been observed for grain boundaries in zno , and we relate all this to one common origin .",

    "an increasing number of nn mg atoms leads to an up - shift of the defect level .",
    "therefore , concerning p - type conductivity , mg doping makes n@xmath16 defects less attractive since the level becomes more narrow and moves deeper into the band gap . on the other hand , the energy level position of the n@xmath28-v@xmath15 defect complex remains almost unchanged for different numbers of nn mg atoms .",
    "the substitution of zn by mg in zno does not help to make the acceptor levels of individual n@xmath2 defects shallow , which would facilitate p - type conductivity at room temperature , but rather provokes the contrary .",
    "moreover , it has been reported@xcite that the presence of mg atoms in the neighborhood of a n@xmath2 defect increases the defect formation energy considerably and therefore reduces the respective defect concentration in the material .",

    "[ fig : defects ] ) are reminiscent of the n@xmath16 defect and the n atom contributes more than 40% in pure zno which increases up to 55% with increasing number of nn mg .",

    "for the vb edge ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : defects ] ) , reminiscent of the v@xmath15 defect , the 3 oxygen atoms are more important ( @xmath3527% ) , but the n - atom still contributes on average with @xmath3520% .",
    "a change in the number of nn mg atoms has only little effect on this spatial distribution with a small shift of weight from the nn metal atoms to n.      for p - type conduction a fermi level close the vb edge and shallow acceptor levels in sufficiently high concentration are needed .",
    "since the thermal excitation energy at room temperature is only about 25 mev , p - type conduction with a significant hole concentration can at best be achieved by acceptor defect levels which are distributed continuously right above the vb edge .",
    "our sic - lda analysis of the most relevant defects in n - doped zmo shows that v@xmath4 and n@xmath2-v@xmath4 indeed provide such defect levels .",
    "our results support the hypothesis that co - doping of zno with mg and n can be a possible route to obtain p - type conductivity .",
    "the ( n@xmath2-v@xmath4 ) defect complex yields shallow acceptor levels which can be activated by the experimentally reported lowering of the net electron concentration in zmo.@xcite this carrier compensation effect increases linearly with the mg content and can be explained by deep - lying mg - related defects which act as charge traps.@xcite    zinc vacancies are low lying energy defects which exist also in pure zno.@xcite however , pure zno usually is an intrinsically n - type semiconductor since donor defects dominate .",
    "only grain boundaries in polycrystalline zno may provoke p - type conducting films@xcite under oxygen rich conditions .",
    "in general the addition of oxygen is thought to reduce the number of oxygen vacancies which are supposed to be the key donor defects .",
    "we believe that an understanding of the effect of oxygen addition has to be extended to take the grain boundaries into account . under oxygen",
    "rich conditions the percentage of grain boundaries with undercoordinated oxygen atoms increases . in previous work@xcite",
    "we have shown that such grain boundaries contribute shallow levels above the vb edge .",
    "these are an equivalent to the defect levels of v@xmath4 in bulk - like zno or zmo discussed here , since the oxygen atoms at the grain boundaries are undercoordinated due to local zn deficiencies .",
    "furthermore , nitrogen at grain boundaries can form shallow defect levels which are very similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : defects_mg ] ( see fig . 11 in ref . ) .",
    "we argue therefore that all these shallow levels are activated due to the depletion zones near grain boundaries.@xcite zhang et al .",
    "interpret their experimental results along this line,@xcite and wang et al .",
    "even suppose that oxygen excess causes the formation of a quasi two dimensional hole gas which could explain the very high mobilities seen in some experiments ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "putting all from above together , this rather general defect - complex mechanism for promoting p - type conductivity in zno , zmo , and related materials emerges : defect complexes which are connected to the zinc vacancies in the bulk interior or at grain boundaries provide shallow defect levels which can serve as acceptor defects .",
    "the activation of these defects by lowering the net electron concentration is provided either by co - doping ( e.g. n and mg@xcite ) or by depletion zones around grain boundaries .",
    "we have studied the electronic densities of states of crystalline zno and zn@xmath0mg@xmath1o with @xmath36 .",
    "we have shown that the sic - lda allows to calculate the electronic band gap as function of the mg content and leads to quantitatively reasonable results with respect to experimental data .",
    "we have determined the electronic defect levels which are generated by the introduction of n@xmath2 substitutional defects .",
    "they are at 0.25 ev above the vb or higher .",
    "an increasing number of neighboring mg atoms to the n@xmath2 site shifts the defect level even deeper into the band gap . on the other hand ,",
    "isolated v@xmath4 defects generate shallow levels attached to the vb edge . in combination with n@xmath2 , the defect complex n@xmath2-v@xmath4 produces low lying defect levels which emerge continuously above the vb and no detached gap states ( like in the case of the isolated n@xmath2 defect ) appear .",
    "it is likely that these levels which are peaked at 125140 mev are connected to experimentally determined acceptor levels which are reported at 130 mev@xcite , 160 mev@xcite or 190 mev.@xcite neighboring mg atoms to the n@xmath2-v@xmath4 defect complex do not change the situation significantly .",
    "apparently the role of mg is mainly a lowering of the net electron concentration which lowers the fermi level and therefore contributes the n@xmath2-v@xmath4 defect complexes as acceptors .",
    "our presented results are consistent with those of an earlier study on zno grain boundaries@xcite , in which we found that at grain boundaries with local zn deficiencies ( which is equivalent to undercoordinated oxygen atoms ) , n@xmath2 defects at the grain boundary produce shallow defect levels without gap to the vb edge and are thus promising acceptor levels .",
    "the following conclusion emerges from this work : one condition for p - type conductivity in zno , zmo , or related materials is to have enough p - type defects like for example n@xmath2 which interact with v@xmath4 point defects , or local zn deficiencies in extended defects like grain boundaries , in order to form shallow gapless defect levels above the vb edge .",
    "moreover , the net electron concentration has to be low enough in order to make these shallow acceptor states partially unoccupied .",
    "this second condition can be achieved by mg@xmath4/n@xmath2 co - doping in the bulk interior or by n@xmath2 doping at grain boundaries to create depletion zones .",

    "<S> possibilities of turning intrinsically n - type oxide semiconductors like zno and zn@xmath0mg@xmath1o into p - type materials are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by recent experiments on zn@xmath0mg@xmath1o doped with nitrogen we analyze the electronic defect levels of point defects n@xmath2 , v@xmath3 , and n@xmath2-v@xmath4 pairs in zno and zn@xmath0mg@xmath1o by means of self - interaction - corrected density functional theory calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the interplay of defects can lead to shallow acceptor defect levels , although the levels of individual point defects n@xmath2 are too deep in the band gap for being responsible for p - type conduction . </S>",
    "<S> we relate our results to p - type conduction paths at grain boundaries seen in polycrystalline zno and develop an understanding of a p - type mechanism which is common to zno , zn@xmath0mg@xmath1o , and related materials . </S>"
