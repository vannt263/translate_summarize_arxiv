    "electron transport through an atomic wire is realized in scanning tunneling microscope(stm ) experiments@xcite and break junctions@xcite .",

    "a true atomic wire was realized as the dipped gold stm tip is slowly retracted from the au substrate . just before breaking ,",
    "the metallic contacts become thinner down to one atom wide and consisting of a few bridging atoms .",
    "yanson and others@xcite succeeded in forming chains of gold atoms up to seven atoms long . the observed conductance@xcite stayed close to one unit of the conductance quantum before breaking .",
    "a quantum dot is a collection of electrons within a small space and can be considered as an artificial atom .",
    "since electrons are confined to the small region , electrons experience the strong coulomb repulsion and their energy level spectrum is discrete . like electrons in atoms ,",
    "the charge and spin of electrons are quantized in quantum dots .",
    "in contrast to the atoms in the periodic table , it is easy to control the energy level spacing , the strength of coulomb interaction , the number of electrons ( charge ) , spin , etc in quantum dots .",
    "when quantum dots are arranged as a linear chain , the system can be considered as an  atomic \" wire .",
    "some i - v curves have been measured in an array of quantum dots .",
    "the splitting of the coulomb peaks@xcite was observed in the conductance when the interdot tunneling rate is strong compared with the coupling to external electrodes .    in this paper , we study the conductance and shot noise in transport through an atomic wire in a two termial configuration .",
    "the atomic wire in our study consists of the monovalent atoms like na , au , ag , cu , etc . and",
    "is modeled by a single orbital tight - binding hamiltonian(see fig .",
    "[ smdots ] . )",
    "when two metallic leads , connected to the atomic wire , are both normal , we study the dependence of linear response conductance and shot noise on the number of atoms in the atomic chain .",
    "when one lead is normal and the other is superconducting , the dependence of the andreev conductance on the number of atoms in the chain is studied .",
    "our discussion is confined to the linear response regime or to the case of weak source - drain bias voltage .",
    "the even - odd behavior of the linear response conductance or oscillation of the conductance as a function of the number of atoms in the atomic wire was theoretically studied using _ ab initio _ calculations@xcite . in heterogeneous carbon atomic wires@xcite where the carbon atomic wires are connected to two metal electrodes ,",
    "the linear response conductance is found to be oscillating as a function of the number of c atoms in the atomic wire .",
    "the conductance is smaller than the conductance quantum @xmath1 and is higher in the odd - numbered atomic wires than in the even - numbered systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the conductance is very close to @xmath2 in the homogeneous sodium atomic wire@xcite when the number of atoms in the wire is odd . in general , the conductance is higher for the atomic wire with an odd number of atoms than with an even number of atoms .",
    "this even - odd parity effect in the conductance can be understood based upon the tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite for the atomic wire .",
    "in addition to reproducing the even - odd behavior of the conductance in the metal - atomic wire - metal junction , we also find the same oscillation in the andreev conductance as a function of the number of atoms in the atomic wire for the metal - atomic wire - superconducting junctions .",
    "when the number of sites ( @xmath0 ) is odd and the atomic wire is mirror symmetric with respect to the center of the atomic wire , the conductance does not depend on the details of the hopping matrices in the atomic wire , but is solely determined by the coupling strength to the two leads .",
    "when @xmath0 is even , the conductance is sensitive to the values of the hopping matrices .    in recent stm experiments of gold nanocontacts@xcite , a small variation of conductance within the region of a unit conductance quantum",
    "was observed ( fig .",
    "1a of reference@xcite ) as the stm tip is stretched before breaking .",
    "since the conductance is close to the unit conductance quantum , the gold chain is one atom thick .",
    "a small variation but abrupt jump in the conductance might originate from an addition of an extra gold atom to the chain .",
    "that is , the observed conductance variation may be a signature of the even - odd parity effects in the atomic wire .",
