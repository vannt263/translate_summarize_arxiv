    "a large volume of data now exists on the hadro - production of @xmath0 at fixed target energies both for the total cross section and the @xmath3 distribution . in particular ,",
    "several new experiments have taken high statistics data with pion or proton beams . since a promising new model for heavy - quarkonium production",
    "is now available , it is useful to perform an analysis in the context of this model .",
    "this is the purpose of this paper .",
    "the physics of heavy quarks can be expected to be dominated by its ( large ) mass , @xmath6 , and hence computable in perturbative qcd . however , for quarkonium systems the scales @xmath7 ( relative momentum ) and @xmath8 ( energy ) are also important , since the quarks are expected to be non - relativistic in the rest frame of the quarkonium . an organised way to include the effects of the dimensionless parameter @xmath9 ( relative velocity ) is provided by an effective low - energy field theory called non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "a cutoff of the order of @xmath6 is introduced @xcite into the qcd action to remove all states of momenta larger than @xmath6 .",
    "their effects are taken into account through new couplings , which are local since the excluded states are relativistic . beyond the leading order in @xmath10",
    "the effective theory is non - renormalisable .",
    "this cut - off theory is block - diagonalised to decouple the heavy - quark degrees of freedom , leaving a non - relativistic schr \" odinger field theory .",
    "consequently , states of a quark anti - quark pair can be specified by the spin , orbital and total angular momentum ( @xmath11 in spectroscopic notation ) , a radial quantum number and the colour representation .",
    "gluons emitted by quarks can be specified in a multipole expansion .",
    "the formalism of nrqcd has been successfully applied to first principles lattice computations of quarkonium spectra @xcite .    in this framework ,",
    "a @xmath12 pair is created by a short - distance process , and it binds into a quarkonium state over scales that are longer by powers of @xmath13 .",
    "assuming factorisation , the cross - section for the production of a meson @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 s are short distance matrix elements and @xmath17 are local 4-fermion operators , of naive dimension @xmath18 , describing the long - distance physics ( the angular brackets denote a vacuum expectation value ) .",
    "the cutoff - dependence of @xmath16 is compensated by that of the long - distance matrix elements .",
    "the colour index @xmath19 can run over singlet as well as octet representations .",
    "the short - distance coefficients @xmath16 have the usual perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath20 .",
    "the scaling of the matrix element @xmath21 with @xmath9 is determined by the ( rotational ) tensor representation of the gluonic transition connecting the state of the produced pair to the target hadron .",
    "consequently , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is a double power series expansion in @xmath9 and @xmath20 . for bottomonium states , @xmath22 is small compared to @xmath23 and hence colour octet contributions are not very significant except when the singlet terms vanish . as a result ,",
    "the expansion is close to the normal perturbative expansion . for charmonium states , a numerical coincidence , @xmath24 , makes the double expansion more complicated .",
    "the importance of colour octet pieces were first seen @xcite in the phenomenology of @xmath25-state charmonium production at large @xmath26 in tevatron data @xcite .",
    "these processes do not have a consistent description in terms of colour singlet operators only @xcite .",
    "however , even for the direct production of @xmath27-states such as the @xmath0 or @xmath28 , where the colour singlet components give the leading contribution in @xmath9 , the inclusion of sub - leading octet states was seen to be necessary for phenomenological reasons @xcite .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the numerical coincidence of @xmath9 and @xmath20 mentioned earlier .",
    "since the long - distance matrix elements are not calculable , and the octet matrix elements are not easily written in terms of decays , the tevatron data must be used to fix these unknown parameters @xcite . as a consequence , quantitative test of this formalism",
    "can come only from other experiments .",
    "fixed - target experiments provide such tests , because colour - singlet contributions are expected to be negligible for photo - production and hadro - production of @xmath0 in appropriate kinematic regions .",
    "a new linear combination of octet matrix elements appears here . in ref .",
    "@xcite this combination has been fixed through an analysis of elastic photo - production data .    in an earlier paper @xcite , we had considered data on hadro - production of @xmath0 in proton - nucleon and pion - nucleon collisions at centre of mass energies , @xmath29 , upto about 60 gev .",
    "we found that the data on forward ( @xmath30 ) integrated cross sections are well described by the inclusion of octet components .",
    "these are parameter - free predictions , because the values of all the required non - perturbative matrix elements are derived from other experiments . in this paper",
    ", we carry out a more detailed investigation of the @xmath3 and @xmath31 distributions of @xmath0 production for the same fixed - target energies .",
    "these are given in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "the octet model predictions for @xmath0 production in fixed - target experiments have also been considered in ref .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is claimed that the ratio of directly produced @xmath0 to @xmath32 states is not in agreement with data .",
    "this is disputed in ref .",
    "we address this question in section 4 .",
    "our results are in agreement with those of ref .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution for inclusive production of @xmath0 can be written as a sum over all possible channels in the form @xmath33 a channel is specified by the rotational and colour quantum numbers of the @xmath12 state , and the colour singlet meson it goes into .",
    "for both colour singlet and octet channels , the strong interaction effects required to bind a pair into a physical meson are specified by the matrix element @xmath34 .",
    "subsequently , this meson decays into the @xmath0 with a branching ratio specified by @xmath35 .",
    "the formul for the channel cross sections @xcite , matrix elements and branching ratios are collected in table [ tb.inputs ] for all the relevant channels .",
    ".the cross sections , non - perturbative matrix elements and branching ratios into the @xmath0 for each channel ( specified by the colour representation @xmath19 , rotational quantum numbers and the primary meson @xmath14 ) relevant to the inclusive @xmath0 cross section of eq .  ( [ sigma ] ) . the gluon and quark luminosities are defined in eq .",
    "( [ lumin ] ) .",
    "the value of the matrix element quoted in the first line is for the linear combination of eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the magnitudes of the various theoretical uncertainties are summarised in table [ tb.err ] .",
    "the errors on the individual non - perturbative matrix elements are quoted in table [ tb.inputs ] . the dominant channel in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is the gluon fusion part of the octet @xmath0 ( the other channels are suppressed either by a branching ratio or by @xmath36 ) . as a result",
    ", the corresponding matrix element dominates this source of uncertainty .",
    "the error quoted in the table above is a 1-@xmath37 limit .",
    "even if it is replaced by a 3-@xmath37 limit , the uncertainty due to the matrix elements remains the smallest source of error .",
    "scale uncertainties in the cross section are a factor of two .",
    "as discussed in the previous paragraph , these may be taken as a rough estimate of the importance of higher order perturbative qcd effects .",
    "apart from the model discussed in this paper , another , called the semi - local duality model ( sld ) @xcite , is also used to describe charmonium cross sections .",
    "this model fixes cross sections for individual charmonium states by comparison with data on the total cross section at some value of @xmath29 .",
    "once this is done , the results @xcite for @xmath29 dependence and @xmath3 are similiar to those reported here .",
    "a distinction can perhaps be made with accurate data at large @xmath3 , since sld predicts a somewhat harder @xmath3 distribution .",
    "other distinctions are possible @xcite , and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "next we turn to the ratio @xmath5 . all the hard cross sections in table [ tb.inputs ]",
    "are taken to order @xmath20 .",
    "the non - perturbative matrix elements in the @xmath38 channels are all of leading order in the velocity @xmath22 , and there are no contributions at order @xmath39 .",
    "the octet terms for @xmath38 are suppressed relative to the singlet terms by @xmath40 . the contribution to direct",
    "@xmath0 production starts at order @xmath39 .",
    "although sub - leading in @xmath9 , it happens to be the channel with the largest contribution ( see figure [ fg.channel ] ) since it is gluon initiated and hence comes with a factor of @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 state , which has the largest branching fraction into @xmath0 has no singlet contribution and hence is also by @xmath40 .      from this discussion",
    "it is clear that the relative magnitudes of the parton luminosities , @xmath41 and @xmath43 , are important in determining the dominant production channels , and may offset the power counting in @xmath9 to some extent . at order @xmath44",
    "there are no new contributions to direct @xmath0 production , but @xmath42 is produced through gluon initial states .",
    "therefore , we have to consider all production channels upto order @xmath44 to get the @xmath32 to direct @xmath0 ratio . beyond the order @xmath44 terms , power counting in @xmath9 can be used to truncate the nrqcd series at any desired level of accuracy , since all the dominant @xmath41 type terms are accounted for at order @xmath44 .",
    "enumerating all possible processes at this order , we find that a certain linear combination , @xmath45 , of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is required for the hadro - production cross section @xcite .",
    "these arise equally from quark and gluon initiated processes and hence the same linear combination @xmath45 is associated with both @xmath41 and @xmath43 .",
    "analysis of the diagrams shows that precisely the same linear combination appears also in the photo - production cross section .      1 .",
    "there are three families of matrix elements involved in @xmath45 .",
    "each scales as @xmath49 ( with order @xmath22 corrections ) @xcite where @xmath50 is the spin of the @xmath32 state .",
    "this gives @xmath51 within nrqcd , the predicted ratio does not depend on whether the mesons are photo- or hadro - produced . nor",
    "does it depend on @xmath29 .",
    "the measurement quoted above comes from a global analysis of hadro - production experiments @xcite .",
    "there are no studies of this ratio in photo - production .",
    "we would like to urge experimentalists to perform such a measurement .",
    "2 .   in photo - production",
    "the ratio of @xmath32 and direct @xmath0 production is determined by the the ratio of the terms in @xmath45 and @xmath52 ( eq .   [ psi ] ) . as a result",
    "this ratio is independent of @xmath29 . in hadro - production",
    "this ratio is altered a little by the contribution of the colour - singlet production of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the ratio increases by about @xmath55 ( see figure [ fg.channel ] ) .",
    "a small @xmath29 dependence is also to be expected in hadro - production due to the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath40 .",
    "this may cause the ratio to be slightly larger at small values of @xmath29 .",
    "a detailed numerical treatement will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "data on this ratio from hadro - production yields the value @xmath56 @xcite , almost independent of @xmath29 . in photo - production",
    "there is only the limit @xmath57 ( 90% cl ) @xcite .",
    "data on this ratio from photo - production experiments would constitute an important test of the nrqcd based colour - octet model .    the introduction of these order @xmath44 terms does not change the inclusive @xmath0 cross section because the value of @xmath52 extracted from photo - production has to decrease due to the inclusion of @xmath45 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath3 distribution comes from the gluon luminosity .",
    "this is clear from figure [ fg.channel ] , since the ratio of the direct to total @xmath0 differential cross section is constant .",
    "since the order @xmath44 contribution also comes from a gluon initiated process , and carries a factor @xmath41 , the shape of the @xmath3 distribution remains unchanged .",
    "the net result of adding all contributions to the cross section upto order @xmath44 is to change only the @xmath32 to direct @xmath0 ratio .",
    "a detailed study will be published later @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the colour - octet model based on nrqcd and an assumption about factorisation , written to order @xmath58 gives a good phenomenological description of the total forward @xmath0 cross section and the @xmath3 and @xmath31 distributions in hadroproduction at fixed target energies .",
    "a small discrepancy is found in extrapolating the fixed target results to isr energies , but these are of a kind that have been earlier seen in single inclusive charm production and removed there by going to higher orders in @xmath20 .",
    "there is a discrepancy in the ratio of @xmath32 to direct @xmath0 production at order @xmath39 .",
    "we have argued that this problem can be solved without changing the results on the cross section by extending the calculations to order @xmath59 .",
    "inclusion of these order @xmath44 terms leads to two predictions that for the @xmath60 ratio is borne out by data , and the other , the rough equality of the @xmath61 ratio in photo- and hadro - production can easily be tested in experiments .",
    "we believe that nrqcd provides a phenomenologically viable model for quarkonium production .",
    "control of the next orders in the expansions in @xmath9 and @xmath20 are , however , necessary .",
    "this work is now in progress @xcite .",
