    "some researchers strongly believe the answer is ` no . '",
    "their objections generally fall into four categories :    1 .",
    "there is a fundamental physical reason why large quantum computers can never be built .",
    "even if ( a ) fails , large quantum computers will never be built in practice .",
    "3 .   even if ( a ) and ( b ) fail , the speedup offered by quantum computers is of limited theoretical interest .",
    "4 .   even if ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) fail , the speedup is of limited practical value .",

    "we ignore the possibility that no speedup exists , in other words that @xmath2 .  by ` large quantum computer '",
    "we mean any computer much faster than its best classical simulation , as a result of asymptotic complexity rather than the speed of elementary operations .",
    "such a computer need not be universal ; it might be specialized for ( say ) factoring . ]",

    "its goal is not to win a debate about this objection ,  but to lay the groundwork for a rigorous discussion , and thus hopefully lead to new science .",
    "section [ qmfail ] provides the philosophical motivation for our paper , by examining the arguments of several quantum computing skeptics , including leonid levin , gerard t hooft , and stephen wolfram .",
    "it concludes that a key weakness of their arguments is their failure to answer the following question : _ _ exactly what property separates the quantum states we are sure we can create , from those that suffice for shor s factoring algorithm ?  _ _ we call such a property a _ sure / shor separator_.  section [ cqs ] develops a complexity theory of pure quantum states , that studies possible sure / shor separators",

    "section [ basic ]  investigates basic properties of this class of states .  among other results",
    ", it shows that any tree state is representable by a tree of polynomial size and logarithmic depth ; and that most states do not even have large inner product with any tree state .",
    "our main results , proved in section [ lower ] , are lower bounds on tree size for various natural families of quantum states .",
    "in particular , section [ ecc ] analyzes subgroup states ,  which are uniform superpositions @xmath7  over all elements of a subgroup @xmath8 .",
    "the importance of these states arises from their central role in stabilizer codes , a type of quantum error - correcting code .",
    "we first show that if @xmath9 is chosen uniformly at random , then with high probability @xmath7 can not be represented by any tree of size @xmath10 .",
    "this result has a corollary of independent complexity - theoretic interest : the first superpolynomial gap between the formula size and the multilinear formula size of a function @xmath11 .",

    "originally , we had hoped to show a superpolynomial tree size lower bound for these states as well .",
    "however , we are only able to show such a bound assuming a number - theoretic conjecture .",
    "our lower bounds use a sophisticated recent technique of raz @xcite , which was introduced to show that the permanent and determinant of a matrix require superpolynomial - size multilinear formulas .",
    "currently , raz s technique is only able to show  lower bounds of the form @xmath14 , but we conjecture that @xmath15  lower bounds hold in all of the cases discussed above",

    "section [ persist ]  addresses this question .",
    "in particular , it shows that if @xmath7  is a superposition over codewords of any sufficiently good erasure code , then @xmath7  has tree size @xmath12 , although not vice versa .",
    "it also argues that raz s lower bound technique is connected to a notion called persistence of entanglement ,  but gives examples showing that the connection is not exact .",
    "section [ treebqp ] addresses the following question .",
    "if the state of a quantum computer at every time step is a tree state , then can the computer be simulated classically ?",
    "in other words , letting @xmath16  be the class of languages accepted by such a machine , does @xmath17 ?",
    "a positive answer would make tree states more attractive as a sure / shor separator .",
    "for once we admit any states incompatible with the polynomial - time church - turing thesis , it seems like we might as well go all the way , and admit _ all _ states preparable by polynomial - size quantum circuits !",
    "although we leave this question open , we do show that @xmath18 , where @xmath19  is the third level of the polynomial hierarchy @xmath20 .",
    "by contrast , it is conjectured that @xmath21 , though admittedly not on strong evidence .",
    "section [ exper ]  discusses the implications of our results for experimental physics .",
    "it advocates a dialectic between theory and experiment , in which theorists would propose a class of quantum states that encompasses everything seen so far , and then experimenters would try to prepare states not in that class",
    ".  it also asks whether states with superpolynomial tree size have already been observed in condensed - matter systems ; and more broadly , what sort of evidence is needed to establish a state s existence .",
    "other issues addressed in section [ exper ]  include how to deal with mixed states and particle position and momentum states , and the experimental relevance of asymptotic bounds .",
    "finally , two appendices investigate quantum state complexity measures other than tree size .",
    "appendix [ cqs ]  shows relationships among tree size , circuit size , bounded - depth tree size , vidal s @xmath22  complexity @xcite , and several other measures",
    ".  it also relates questions about quantum state classes to more traditional questions about computational complexity classes .",
    "appendix [ mots ]  studies a weakening of tree size called manifestly orthogonal tree size ,  and shows that this measure can sometimes be characterized _ exactly _ , enabling us to prove _ exponential _ lower bounds .",
    "our techniques in appendix [ mots ]  might be of independent interest to complexity theorists .",
    "we conclude in section [ open ]  with some open problems .",
    "this section discusses objection ( a ) , that quantum computing is impossible for a fundamental physical reason .  among computer scientists ,",

    "first , even classically , one can flip a coin a thousand times to produce probabilities of order @xmath23 .",
    "should one dismiss such probabilities as unphysical ?  at the very least ,",
    "it is not obvious that amplitudes should behave differently than probabilities with respect to error  since both evolve linearly , and neither is directly observable .",
    "second , if levin believes that quantum mechanics will fail , but is agnostic about what will replace it , then his argument can be turned around .  how do we know that the successor to quantum mechanics will limit us to @xmath24 , rather than letting us solve ( say ) @xmath25-complete problems ?  this is more than a logical point .",
    "abrams and lloyd @xcite  argue that a wide class of nonlinear variants of the schrdinger equation would allow @xmath26-complete and even @xmath27-complete problems to be solved  in polynomial time .  and",
    "penrose @xcite , who proposed a model for ` objective collapse ' of the wavefunction , believes that his proposal takes us outside the set of computable functions entirely !",
    "third , to falsify quantum mechanics , it would suffice to show that a quantum computer evolved to _ some _ state far from the state that quantum mechanics predicts .",
    "measuring the exact state is unnecessary .",
    "nobel prizes have been awarded in the past ` merely ' for falsifying a previously held theory , rather than replacing it by a new one .",
    "an example is the physics nobel awarded to fitch @xcite and cronin  @xcite  in 1980 for discovering cp symmetry violation .",
    "perhaps the key to understanding levin s unease about quantum computing lies in his remark that we have never seen a physical law valid to over a dozen decimals .",
    "here he touches on a serious epistemological question :  _ how far should we extrapolate from today s experiments to where quantum mechanics has never been tested ? _",
    "we will try to address this question by reviewing the evidence for quantum mechanics .  for our purposes",
    "it will not suffice to declare the predictions of quantum mechanics verified to one part in a trillion ,  because we need to distinguish at least three different _ types _ of prediction : _ interference _ , _ entanglement _ , and _",
    "schrdinger cats_.",
    "let us consider these in turn .",
    "1 .   * interference . *",
    "if the different paths that an electron could take in its orbit around a nucleus did not interfere destructively , canceling each other out , then electrons would not have quantized energy levels .",
    "so being accelerating electric charges , they would lose energy and spiral into their respective nuclei , and all matter would disintegrate .  that this has not happened  together with the results of ( for example ) single - photon double - slit experiments ",
    "is compelling evidence for the reality of quantum interference .",
    "* entanglement .",
    "*  one might accept that a single particle s position is described by a wave in three - dimensional phase space , but deny that two particles are described by a wave in _ six_-dimensional phase space .",
    "however , the bell inequality experiments of aspect et al .",
    "@xcite  and successors have convinced all but a few physicists that quantum entanglement exists , can be maintained over large distances , and can not be explained by local hidden - variable theories .",
    "* schrdinger cats .",
    "*  accepting two- and three - particle entanglement is not the same as accepting that whole molecules , cats , humans , and galaxies can be in coherent superposition states .  however , recently arndt et al .",
    "@xcite  have performed the double - slit interference experiment using @xmath28  molecules ( buckyballs ) instead of photons ; while friedman et al .",
    "@xcite  have found evidence that a superconducting current , consisting of billions of electrons , can enter a coherent superposition of flowing clockwise around a coil and flowing counterclockwise ( see leggett @xcite for a survey of such experiments ) .",
    "though short of cats , these experiments at least allow us to say the following : _ if we could build a general - purpose quantum computer with as many components as have already been placed into coherent superposition , then on certain problems , that computer would outperform any computer in the world today . _    having reviewed some of the evidence for quantum mechanics , we must now ask what alternatives have been proposed that might also explain the evidence .",
    "the simplest alternatives are those in which quantum states spontaneously collapse  with some probability , as in the grw ( ghirardi - rimini - weber ) theory @xcite .",
    "the drawbacks of the grw theory include violations of energy conservation , and parameters that must be fine - tuned to avoid conflicting with experiments .  more relevant for us ,",
    "though , is that the collapses postulated by the theory are only in the position basis , so that quantum information stored in internal degrees of freedom ( such as spin ) is unaffected .",
    "furthermore , even if we extended the theory to collapse those internal degrees , large quantum computers could still be built .",
    "for the theory predicts roughly one collapse per particle per @xmath29  seconds , with a collapse affecting everything in a @xmath30-meter vicinity .",
    "so even in such a vicinity , one could perform a computation involving ( say ) @xmath31  particles for @xmath32  seconds .  finally , as pointed out to us by rob spekkens , standard quantum error - correction techniques",
    "might be used to overcome even grw - type decoherence .",
    "a second class of alternatives includes those of t hooft @xcite  and wolfram @xcite , in which something like a deterministic cellular automaton underlies quantum mechanics .  on the basis of his theory ,",
    "t hooft predicts that i]t will never be possible to construct a ` quantum computer ' that can factor a large number faster , and within a smaller region of space , than a classical machine would do , if the latter could be built out of parts at least as large and as slow as the planckian dimensions  @xcite .",
    "similarly , wolfram states  that `` [ i]ndeed within the usual formalism [ of quantum mechanics ] one can construct quantum computers that may be able to solve at least a few specific problems exponentially faster than ordinary turing machines .  but particularly after my discoveries ",
    "i strongly suspect that even if this is formally the case , it will still not turn out to be a true representation of ultimate physical reality , but will instead just be found to reflect various idealizations made in the models used so far '' @xcite .",
    "the obvious question then is how these theories account for bell inequality violations .",
    "we confess to being unable to understand t hooft s answer to this question , except that he believes that the usual notions of causality and locality might no longer apply in quantum gravity .  as for wolfram",
    "s theory , which involves long - range threads  to account for bell inequality violations , we argued in @xcite  that it fails wolfram s own desiderata of causal and relativistic invariance .",
    "so the challenge for quantum computing skeptics is clear .",
    "ideally , come up with an alternative to quantum mechanics  even an idealized toy theory  that can account for all present - day experiments , yet would not allow large - scale quantum computation .  failing that , _",
    "at least say what you take quantum mechanics domain of validity to be_.  one way to do this would be to propose a set @xmath9 of quantum states that you believe corresponds to possible physical states of affairs .",
    "is acted on by a unitary @xmath33 such that @xmath34 , but this will not be insisted upon . ]",
    "the set @xmath9 must contain all sure states  ( informally , the states that have already been demonstrated in the lab ) , but no shor states  ( again informally , the states that can be shown to suffice for factoring , say , @xmath35-digit numbers ) .",
    "if @xmath9 satisfies both of these constraints , then we call @xmath9 a _ sure / shor separator _ ( see figure 1 ) .    of course",
    ", an alternative theory need not involve a sharp cutoff between possible and impossible states .",
    "so it is perfectly acceptable for a skeptic to define a complexity measure  @xmath36  for quantum states , and then say something like the following :  _ if _ @xmath37 _ _  is a state of _ _ @xmath38 _ spins , and _",
    "@xmath39 _ _  is at most , say , _ _ @xmath40 _ _ , then i predict that _ _",
    "_  can be prepared using only polynomial effort .",
    "also , once prepared , _ _",
    "@xmath41 _ _  will be governed by standard quantum mechanics to extremely high precision .",
    "all states created to date have had small values of _ _",
    "@xmath42__.  however , if _ _",
    "@xmath39 _ _  grows as , say , _ _",
    "@xmath43 _ _ , then i predict that _ _",
    "@xmath41 _ _  requires exponential effort  to prepare , or else is not even approximately governed by quantum mechanics , or else does not even make sense in the context of an alternative theory .",
    "the states that arise in shor s factoring algorithm have exponential values of _ _",
    "so as my sure / shor separator , i propose the set of all infinite families of states _ _ @xmath44 _ _ , where _ _ @xmath45 _ _  has _",
    "_ @xmath38 _ qubits , such that _ @xmath46 _ for some polynomial _ @xmath13__. _ _    to understand the importance of sure / shor separators , it is helpful to think through some examples .",
    "a major theme of levin s arguments was that exponentially small amplitudes are somehow unphysical .",
    "however , clearly we can not reject _ all _ states with tiny amplitudes  for would anyone dispute that the state @xmath47  is formed whenever @xmath48 photons are each polarized at @xmath49 ?  indeed , once we accept @xmath50  and @xmath51  as sure states , we are almost _ forced _ to accept @xmath52  as well  since we can imagine , if we like , that @xmath53  and @xmath54  are prepared in two separate laboratories .",
    "is a sure state , _ given _ that @xmath53  and @xmath51  are both sure states that are well - described in tensor product hilbert spaces . ]",
    "so considering a shor state such as@xmath55 what property of this state could quantum computing skeptics latch onto as being physically extravagant ?",
    "they might complain that @xmath56  involves entanglement across hundreds or thousands of particles ; but as mentioned earlier , there are other states with that same property , namely the schrdinger cats  @xmath57 , that should be regarded as sure states .",
    "alternatively , the skeptics might object to the _ combination _ of exponentially small amplitudes with entanglement across hundreds of particles .",
    "however , simply viewing a schrdinger cat state in the hadamard basis produces an equal superposition over all strings of even parity , which has both properties .",
    "we seem to be on a slippery slope leading to all of quantum mechanics !  is there any defensible place to draw a line ?",
    "the dilemma above is what led us to propose _ tree states _ as a possible sure / shor separator .",
    "the idea , which might seem more natural to logicians than to physicists , is this .",
    "once we accept the linear combination and tensor product rules of quantum mechanics ",
    "allowing @xmath58  and @xmath59  into our set @xmath9 of possible states whenever @xmath60one of our few remaining hopes for keeping @xmath9 a proper subset of the set of _ all _ states is to impose some restriction on how those two rules can be iteratively applied .",
    "in particular , we could let @xmath9 be the closure of @xmath61  under a _ polynomial number _ of linear combinations and tensor products .",
    "that is , @xmath9  is the set of all infinite families of states @xmath62 with @xmath63 , such that @xmath41  can be expressed as a tree  involving at most @xmath64  addition , tensor product , @xmath65 , and @xmath66  gates for some polynomial @xmath13 ( see figure 2 ) .    to be clear",
    ", we are _ not _ advocating that all states in nature are tree states  as a serious physical hypothesis .",
    "indeed , even if we believed firmly in a breakdown of quantum mechanics , there are other choices for the set @xmath9 that seem equally reasonable .",
    "for example , define _ orthogonal tree states _ similarly to tree states , except that we can only form the linear combination @xmath67  if @xmath68 .  rather than choose among tree states , orthogonal tree states , and the other candidate sure / shor separators that occurred to us",
    ", our approach will be to prove everything we can about all of them .",
    "if we devote more space to tree states than to others , that is simply because tree states are the subject of our most interesting results .  on the other hand ,",
    "if we show ( for example ) that @xmath69  is not a tree state , then we have also shown that @xmath70  is not an orthogonal tree state .",
    "so many candidate separators are related to each other ; and indeed , their relationships will be a major theme of the paper .",
    "let us summarize .  to debate whether quantum computing is fundamentally impossible , we need at least one proposal for how it _",
    "could _ be impossible .  since even skeptics admit that quantum mechanics is valid within some regime ,  a key challenge for any such proposal is to separate the regime of acknowledged validity from the quantum computing regime .  though others will disagree",
    ", we do not see any choice but to _ identify those two regimes with classes of quantum states_.  for gates and measurements that suffice for quantum computing have already been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "thus , if we tried to identify the two regimes with classes of gates or measurements , then we could equally well talk about the class of _ states _ on which all @xmath71- and @xmath72-qubit operations behave as expected .",
    "a similar argument would apply if we identified the two regimes with classes of quantum circuits  since any memory  that a quantum system retains of the previous gates in a circuit , is part of the system s state by definition .",
    "so : states , gates , measurements , circuits  what else is there ?",
    "we should stress that none of the above depends on the interpretation of quantum mechanics .  in particular",
    ", it is irrelevant whether we regard quantum states as really out there  or as representing subjective knowledge  since in either case , the question is whether there can exist systems that we would _",
    "describe _ by @xmath50  based on their observed behavior .",
    "once we agree to seek a sure / shor separator , we quickly find that the obvious ideas  based on precision in amplitudes , or entanglement across of hundreds of particles  are nonstarters .",
    "the only idea that we have found plausible is to limit the class of allowed quantum states to those with some kind of succinct representation .  that still leaves numerous possibilities ; and for each one",
    ", it might be a difficult problem to decide whether a given @xmath53  is succinctly representable or not .",
    "thus , constructing a useful theory of sure / shor separators will not be easy .",
    "but we should start somewhere .",
    "in both quantum and classical complexity theory , the objects studied are usually sets of languages or boolean functions .",
    "however , a generic @xmath38-qubit quantum state requires exponentially many classical bits to describe , and this suggests looking at _ the complexity of quantum states themselves_.  that is , which states have polynomial - size classical descriptions of various kinds ?  this question has been studied from several angles by aharonov and ta - shma @xcite ;  janzing , wocjan , and beth @xcite ;  vidal @xcite ; and green et al .",
    "@xcite .  here",
    "we propose a general framework for the question .  for simplicity , we limit ourselves to pure states @xmath73 with the fixed orthogonal basis @xmath74 .  also ,",
    "by ` states ' we mean infinite families of states @xmath75 .    like complexity classes ,",
    "pure quantum states can be organized into a hierarchy ( see figure 3 ) .  at the bottom",
    "are the classical basis states , which have the form @xmath76  for some @xmath77 .",
    "we can generalize classical states in two directions : to the class @xmath78 of separable states , which have the form @xmath79 ; and to the class @xmath80 , which consists of all states @xmath45  that are superpositions of at most @xmath64  classical states , where @xmath13 is a polynomial .  at the next level",

    "the results of this paper suggest an obvious challenge for experimenters : _ prepare non - tree states in the lab_.  for were this challenge met , it would rule out one way in which quantum mechanics could fail , just as the bell inequality experiments of aspect et al .",
    "@xcite  did twenty years ago .",
    "if they wished , quantum computing skeptics could then propose a new candidate sure / shor separator , and experimenters could try to rule out _ that _ one , and so on .  the result would be to divide the question of whether quantum computing is possible into a series of smaller questions about which states can be prepared .  in our view",
    ", this would aid progress in two ways : by helping experimenters set clear goals , and by forcing theorists to state clear positions",
    ".    however , our experimental challenge raises some immediate questions .",
    "in particular , what would it _",
    "mean _ to prepare a non - tree state ?",
    "how would we know if we succeeded ?",
    "also , have non - tree states already been prepared ( or observed ) ?  the purpose of this section is to set out our thoughts about these questions .",
    "first of all , when discussing experiments , it goes without saying that we must convert asymptotic statements into statements about specific values of @xmath38 .  the central tenet of computational complexity theory is that this is possible .",
    "thus , instead of asking whether @xmath38-qubit states with tree size @xmath712  can be prepared , we ask whether @xmath713-qubit states with tree size at least ( say ) @xmath714  can be prepared .",
    "even though the second question does not logically imply anything about the first , the second is closer to what we ultimately care about anyway .  admittedly , knowing that @xmath715  tells us little about @xmath716  or @xmath717 , especially since in raz s paper @xcite , the constant in the exponent @xmath718  is taken to be @xmath719  ( though this",
    "can certainly be improved ) .",
    "thus , proving tight lower bounds for small @xmath38 is one of the most important problems left open by this paper .  in appendix",
    "[ mots ] we solve the problem for the case of manifestly orthogonal tree size .",
    "a second common objection is that our formalism applies only to pure states , but in reality all states are mixed .",
    "however , there are several natural ways to extend the formalism to mixed states .",
    "given a mixed state @xmath720 , we could minimize tree size over all purifications of @xmath720 , or minimize the expected tree size @xmath721 , or maximum @xmath722 , over all decompositions @xmath723 .",
    "a third objection is a real quantum state might be a soup  of free - wandering fermions and bosons , with no localized subsystems corresponding to qubits .",
    "how can one determine the tree size of such a state ?",
    "the answer is that one can not .",
    "any complexity measure for particle position and momentum states would have to be quite different from the measures considered in this paper .",
    "on the other hand , the states of interest for quantum computing usually _ do _ involve localized qubits .  indeed ,",
    "even if quantum information is stored in particle positions , one might force each particle into two sites ( corresponding to @xmath724  and @xmath66 ) , neither of which can be occupied by any other particle .  in that case",
    "it again becomes meaningful to discuss tree size .",
    "but how do we verify that a state with large tree size was prepared ?",
    "of course , if @xmath53  is preparable by a polynomial - size quantum circuit , then _ assuming quantum mechanics is valid _ ( and assuming our gates behave as specified )",
    ", we can always test whether a given state @xmath51  is close to @xmath50  or not .",
    "let @xmath33  map @xmath274  to @xmath53 ; then it suffices to test whether @xmath725  is close to @xmath294",
    ".  however , in the experiments under discussion , the validity of quantum mechanics is the very point in question .",
    "and once we allow nature to behave in arbitrary ways , a skeptic could explain _ any _ experimental result without having to invoke states with large tree size .",
    "the above fact has often been urged against us , but as it stands , it is no different from the fact that one could explain any astronomical observation without abandoning the ptolemaic system .",
    "the issue is not one of mathematical proof , but of accumulating observations that are consistent with  the hypothesis of large tree size , and inconsistent with alternative hypotheses if we disallow special pleading .",
    "so for example , to test whether the subgroup state@xmath726 was prepared , we might use cnot gates to map @xmath76  to @xmath727 for some vector @xmath728 .",
    "based on our knowledge of @xmath9 , we could then predict whether the qubit @xmath729  should be @xmath65 , @xmath66 , or an equal mixture of @xmath65 and @xmath66 when measured .",
    "or we could apply hadamard gates to all @xmath38 qubits of @xmath730 , then perform the same test for the subgroup dual to @xmath9 .  in saying that a system is in state @xmath7 , it is not clear if we _",
    "mean _ anything more than that it responds to all such tests in expected ways .",
    "similar remarks apply to shor states and cluster states .    in our view",
    ", tests of the sort described above are certainly _ sufficient _ , so the interesting question is whether they are _ necessary _ , or whether weaker and more indirect tests would also suffice .",
    "this question rears its head when we ask whether non - tree states have already been observed .  for as pointed out to us by anthony leggett ,",
    "there exist systems studied in condensed - matter physics that are strong candidates for having superpolynomial tree size .",
    "an example is the magnetic salt liho@xmath731y@xmath732f@xmath733 studied by ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite , which , like the cluster states of briegel and raussendorf @xcite , basically consists of a lattice of spins subject to pairwise nearest - neighbor hamiltonians .",
    "the main differences are that the salt lattice is 3-d instead of 2-d , is tetragonal instead of cubic , and is irregular in that not every site is occupied by a spin .  also , there are weak interactions even between spins that are not nearest neighbors .",
    "but none of these differences seems likely to change a superpolynomial tree size into a polynomial one .    for us ,",
    "the main issues are ( 1 ) how precisely can we characterize , in some standard basis .",
    "if a state is characterized as the ground state of a hamiltonian , then we first need to solve for the amplitudes before we can prove tree size lower bounds using raz s method . ]",
    "the quantum state of the magnetic salt , and ( 2 ) how strong the evidence is that that _ is _ the state .",
    "what ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite  did was to calculate bulk properties of the salt , such as its magnetic susceptibility and specific heat , with and without taking into account the quantum entanglement generated by the nearest - neighbor hamiltonians .",
    "they found that including entanglement yielded a better fit to the experimentally measured values .",
    "however , this is clearly a far cry from preparing a system in a state of one s choosing by applying a known pulse sequence , and then applying any of a vast catalog of tests to verify that the state was prepared .",
    "so it would be valuable to have more direct evidence that states qualitatively like cluster states can exist in nature .    in summary ,",
    "our results underscore the importance of current experimental work on large , persistently entangled quantum states ; but they also suggest a new motivation and perspective for this work .  they suggest that we reexamine known condensed - matter systems with a new goal in mind : understanding the complexity of their associated quantum states .  they also suggest that 2-d cluster states and random subgroup states are interesting in a way that 1-d spin chains and schrdinger cat states are not .  yet when experimenters try to prepare states of the former type , they often see it as merely a stepping stone towards demonstrating error - correction or another quantum computing benchmark .  thus , knill et al .",
    "@xcite prepared , where @xmath236 is the maximally mixed state and @xmath734 .",
    "braunstein et al .",
    "@xcite  have shown that , if the number of qubits @xmath38 is less than about @xmath735 , then such states can not be entangled .",
    "that is , there exists a representation of @xmath720  as a mixture of pure states , each of which is separable and therefore has tree size @xmath736 .",

    "we see nothing wrong with having multiple ways to quantify the complexity of quantum states , and much wrong with having no ways .",

    "this separation allowed computer scientists to make great advances on the latter question , despite knowing nothing about the former .",

    "the claim that large - scale quantum computing is possible in principle is really a claim that certain _ states _ can exist  that quantum mechanics will not break down if we try to prepare those states .",
    "furthermore , what distinguishes these states from states we have seen must be more than precision in amplitudes , or the number of qubits maintained coherently .",
    "the distinguishing property should instead be some sort of _",

    "we have tried to show that , by adopting this viewpoint , we make the debate about whether quantum computing is possible less ideological and more scientific .  by studying particular examples of sure / shor separators",
    ", quantum computing skeptics would strengthen their case  for they would then have a plausible research program aimed at identifying what , exactly , the barriers to quantum computation are .",
    "we hope , however , that the ` complexity theory of quantum states ' initiated in this paper will be taken up by quantum computing proponents as well .",
