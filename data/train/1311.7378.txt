    "quantum hamiltonian complexity ( qhc ) has blossomed into an incredibly active field of research over the past few years ( see @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "a key player in qhc is the local hamiltonian problem ( @xmath10 ) @xcite , whose study had led to various unexpected discoveries , ranging from the universality of adiabatic computation @xcite , to the @xmath0 hardness of one dimensional systems @xcite , to quantum gadgets @xcite , to computational complexity lower bounds on notorious open problems in physics @xcite , to the hardness of translationally invariant systems @xcite , and more .    in this note",
    "we focus on a special case of the @xmath10 problem , called the commuting local hamiltonian problem ( @xmath2 ) , which has attracted considerable attention in the past few years ( e.g.,@xcite ) . before we explain our result ,",
    "let us define the problem more precisely .",
    "a @xmath6-local hamiltonian is a hermitian matrix @xmath11 operating on the hilbert space of @xmath12 @xmath7-dimensional particles ( _ qudits _ ) , where each term @xmath13 ( sometimes called constraint ) acts non - trivially on at most @xmath6 particles .",
    "kitaev defined in @xmath14 the local hamiltonian ( @xmath10 ) problem @xcite , where one is given a local hamiltonian on @xmath12 qudits , and two real numbers @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , and is asked whether the lowest eigenvalue ( _ ground energy _ ) is at most @xmath17 or at least @xmath18 .",
    "kitaev showed @xcite that this problem is complete for the class @xmath0 , the quantum analogue of @xmath1 .",
    "this provided a quantum counterpart of the celebrated cook - levin theorem @xcite . to restrict the discussion to _ commuting _",
    "local hamiltonians , we require in addition that every two terms @xmath19 commute .",
    "w.l.o.g we can assume in this case that @xmath13 s are projections .",
    "we denote the family of such hamiltonians acting on @xmath7 dimensional particles and where each term is @xmath6-local , by @xmath20 ; we can now consider the @xmath2 problem ( introduced by bravyi and vyalyi in @xmath21 @xcite ) , which is the analogue of the @xmath10 problem for the commuting case .",
    "note that since we are concerned with @xmath13 s which are commuting projections , the eigenvalues of @xmath22 are natural numbers .",
    "the problem is now to distinguish between the ground energy being @xmath23 or at least @xmath24 .",
    "the commutation restriction might seem at first sight to devoid the @xmath10 problem of its quantum nature , and place it in @xmath1 , since all local terms can be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "moreover , one usually attributes the interesting features of quantum mechanics to its non - commutative nature , cf . the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "this intuition is importantly wrong .",
    "the main source for the interest in @xmath2s lies in the beautiful and striking fact that the groundspaces of @xmath2s are capable of possessing intriguing multi - particle entanglement phenomena , such as topological order @xcite , and quantum error correction @xcite ; the most well known example is kitaev s toric code @xcite . due to this intriguing phenomenon",
    ", the study of @xmath2s has become highly influential in the physics as well as the quantum complexity communities , see e.g. the study of levin - wen models @xcite , quantum double models @xcite , as well as that of stabilizer error correcting codes @xcite , which are special cases of @xmath2 s .    in their @xmath21 paper , bravyi and vyalyi",
    "@xcite proved a central result regarding the @xmath2 problem : the @xmath9-local case ( namely , the case of @xmath25 ) lies in @xmath1 .",
    "the proof uses a clever application of the theory of representations of @xmath26-algebras , with which bravyi and vyalyi showed that for such systems , there is always a ground state which can be generated by a constant depth quantum circuit ; in particular , the description of the constant depth quantum circuit can be given as a classical witness , from which the energy of the state can be computed efficiently by a classical computer ( implying the containment in @xmath1 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 question is thus interesting ( from the quantum complexity point of view ) only with locality @xmath27 .",
    "the bravyi - vyalyi result was extended later in various special cases @xcite , but the complexity of the general @xmath2 problem remains open , and as far as we currently know it may lie anywhere between @xmath1 and the full power of @xmath0 . - which is defined like @xmath0 except in case of yes , there exists a state which is accepted with probability exactly @xmath28 . here",
    "we will not distinguish between @xmath0 and @xmath29 since we are not using those terms technically , but see @xcite and @xcite . ]    in this paper , we study the hardness of _ approximation _ versions of the @xmath2 problem . our motivation is two - fold : one , we view this as an important stepping stone towards the clarification of the complexity of the exact @xmath2 problem , which has resisted resolution so far , despite the effort described above .",
    "two , we view it as an important special case of a major conjecture in qhc , namely , the quantum @xmath8 ( @xmath3 ) conjecture , to be discussed below .    our main result states that the approximation problem of @xmath2 lies within @xmath1 , whenever the underlying bi - partite interaction graph of the @xmath2 instance is a good enough _ locally - expanding graph _",
    "( for definition see below ) .",
    "this means that good local expansion of the underlying interaction graph does not help but in fact _ disturbs _ in generating `` hard '' quantum instances , in sharp contrast to the classical analogue in which the hard instances are excellent locally - expanding graphs ( see @xcite and theorem [ thm : nphard ] below ) .",
    "the result implies severe constraints on the structure of possible @xmath3s for @xmath2s , as the output of those can not be good local expanders .",
    "before we state the result and its implications more formally , we provide some further background and context .",
    "the classical @xmath8 theorem @xcite is arguably the most important discovery in classical theoretical computer science over the past quarter century ; to state it , recall the constraint satisfaction problem ( @xmath30 ) : given is a collection of @xmath6-local constraints on @xmath12 boolean or @xmath7-state variables .",
    "the problem is to decide whether the instance is satisfiable or not ; this problem is @xmath1 complete .",
    "the @xmath8 theorem states that there exists an efficient mapping ( known as a @xmath8 reduction ) which takes satisfiable instances to satisfiable instances and non - satisfiable ones to non - satisfiable ones , such that the @xmath1 witness for the new instances can be tested , with constant probability of success , by reading only a constant number of randomly chosen locations in the witness ( ! )",
    ". stated differently , the @xmath8 theorem says that it is @xmath1 hard to decide whether a given instance is satisfiable , or at most some constant fraction , say @xmath31 , of its constraints can be satisfied .",
    "one may ask @xcite does an analogous statement hold in the quantum setting as well ?",
    "a quantum @xmath8 conjecture @xcite can be phrased as follows :    * quantum @xmath8 ( @xmath3 ) * there exists @xmath32 , such that it is @xmath0-hard to decide whether a given @xmath6-local hamiltonian @xmath33 , with @xmath34 whose terms are all positive semi - definite , is satisfiable ( namely , has ground value @xmath35 ) or its minimal eigenvalue is at least @xmath36 .",
    "this conjecture is one of the major open problems in qhc today ( see the recent survey @xcite ) .",
    "it is important for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the question is related to the question of whether quantum entanglement can be made robust at room temperature . secondly , the question of whether or not @xmath3s exist is tightly related to fundamental questions regarding local and global multi - particle entanglement .",
    "the resolution of the conjecture , in either direction , would constitute a major advance in qhc and in our understand of quantum matter .",
    "however , despite considerable effort , so far all attempts to extend the classical proofs of the @xmath8 theorem to the quantum settings , or to dispute the conjecture , have encountered severe obstacles @xcite .",
    "we currently do not even have a good guess whether the conjecture should hold or not .",
    "just like in the classical case , the @xmath3 conjecture is equivalent to the following statement : the problem of approximating the ground energy of local hamiltonians to within a constant fraction is @xmath0 hard .",
    "this means that the clarification of the complexity of approximating the local hamiltonian problem is of major interest .",
    "given the difficulty of this question , it is natural to study hardness of approximation of restricted classes hamiltonians ; we focus here on @xmath2s , which are a particularly attractive special case , since they are both much easier to analyze than the general case , and in addition , they possess a simplifying structure as introduced in @xcite , while still giving rise to extremely complex phenomenon such as topological order , and used as a substrate for almost all known quantum codes .      the geometry of the underlying interaction graph is well known to play a crucial role for the complexity of constraint satisfaction problem . for a start ,",
    "when a @xmath30 is defined between variables set a one dimensional lattice , with constraints between nearest neighbors only , the problem lies in @xmath37 ( using dynamic programming ) , whereas for @xmath9 or more dimensions , the problem is @xmath1-hard .",
    "when one is interested in approximations ( to within any constant fraction of the number of constraints ) the situation changes : approximating @xmath30s , as well as @xmath10s , to within any constant , lies in @xmath37 when the interaction graph is a lattice of _ any _ constant dimension . to see this , partition the lattice to constant size cubes , and remove the constraints that connect different cubes ; we arrive at a collection of disconnected constant - size subproblems , all of which can be optimized together in @xmath37 .",
    "the number of constraints violated by this solution is at most the number of removed constraints , which can be made to be an arbitrarily small fraction .",
    "this argument works similarly both in the quantum and classical cases , and implies that to make the approximation problem hard , one has to consider @xmath30s , @xmath2s or @xmath10s whose underlying graphs have certain expansion properties .    in light of the above , and motivated by the important role that expanders play in the classical theory of hardness of approximation and @xmath8s , we turn to the study of approximating @xmath2 systems on expanders . we need our definition of expansion to work for @xmath6-local hamiltonians , for @xmath27 , since @xmath9-local @xmath2s are already known to be in @xmath1 even without approximation @xcite",
    ". one might consider working with the naturally induced hypergraphs , but there is no consensus on the right definition of expansion for hypergraphs in the literature .",
    "moreover , whereas one is perhaps used to intuitively think of standard graph expansion as the important property for hardness in classical complexity , perhaps due to the strong usage of expansion in dinur s @xmath8 proof @xcite , it is in fact an open question to relate expansion , and in particular _ small - set _ expansion , ( namely expansion of sets of constant fractional size ) to computational hardness @xcite .",
    "here we consider , for a given @xmath2 , the bi - partite graph in which variables are on the left side and constraints are on the right , and a variable is connected to the constraints that it appears in .",
    "for this bi - partite graph , we consider a very _ weak _ notion of expansion , which we call _ local expansion _ : we say that the bi - partite graph induced by a @xmath6-local @xmath2 instance is @xmath4-locally expanding , if for any set @xmath38 of at most @xmath6 particles , the number of local terms incident on these particles is at least @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the left degree of the graph ( here we assume all degrees are equal , see definition [ def : expbi ] for the general case ) .",
    "observe that @xmath41 is the maximal possible number of constraints acting on those particles , so @xmath4 can be viewed a `` correction '' to this number , or the _ expansion error_. we note that this definition of local expansion cares only about the expansion of constant - size sets , whereas in complexity theory , one is often interested in _ small - set _ bi - partite expanders , in which all sets of size up to some _ constant fraction _ of @xmath42 are required to expand @xcite ; our requirements on bi - partite expanders are thus significantly weaker.s are stronger if they hold for graphs which satisfy weaker requirements ] it turns out that the notion of local expansion can indeed be related , in the classical world , to computational hardness ; as we show in theorem [ thm : nphard ] sufficiently good local expanders are computationally hard for classical computers . as we will see ( in theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] ) this is not the case in the quantum world . ] .",
    "we can now state our main result , theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] , in which we show that the problem of approximating @xmath2s on locally - expanding graphs lies inside @xmath1 , and thus can not be @xmath0 hard ( under standard complexity assumptions ) :    [ thm : approxbpinnp ] ( the approximation of @xmath2 on good locally - expanding bi - partite graphs is in @xmath1 ) let @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 , be an instance of @xmath20 for constants @xmath45 , with bi - partite interaction graph which is @xmath4-locally - expanding , for @xmath46 .",
    "then the @xmath47-approximation problem of @xmath20 on such @xmath4 locally - expanding bi - partite graph graphs is in @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , for any eigenvalue @xmath48 of @xmath22 there exists a state @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , such that @xmath49 can be generated by a constant depth quantum circuit .",
    "we rule out the possibility that @xmath47 is large enough so that by removing a @xmath47 fraction of the terms in @xmath22 we can simply trivialize the problem and place it in @xmath37 ( e.g. , by disconnecting the graph into small components , as is done in the approximation of @xmath2s on lattices ) .",
    "we do this by showing that the problem remains @xmath1-hard even with this approximation factor .",
    "[ thm : nphard ] fix @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath4 be such that @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a universal constant .",
    "then it is @xmath1-hard to approximate @xmath20 whose bi - partite interaction graph is @xmath4 locally - expanding , to within a factor @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 in the above statement is some universal constant which appears in the @xmath8 proof of dinur @xcite ; we delay its exact definition to subsection [ sec : nphard ] but it is not important . theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] implies that if indeed one could construct a quantum @xmath8 whose output is a @xmath2 , then in contrast to classical @xmath8 ( see the proof of theorem [ thm : nphard ] ) , the output can not have arbitrarily high local expansion .",
    "the question of approximating the ground energy of local hamiltonians was broadly studied in the physics literature for specific hamiltonians of particular interest in physics .",
    "not much is known regarding the hardness of approximation of the general case .",
    "kempe and gharibian @xcite derived a non - trivial result for a related task : given a @xmath6-local hamiltonian on @xmath7 dimensional qudits , and we are asked to find the state with _ maximal _",
    "energy @xmath56 .",
    "they showed that there always exists a product state with energy at least @xmath57 , and so the problem of approximating max-@xmath6-local hamiltonian to within approximation factor @xmath58 lies in @xmath1 ( see also a follow up paper by the same authors on approximation versions of problems which are computationally even harder @xcite ) .",
    "the approach of examining commuting hamiltonians as a precursor for the general case was taken before , e.g. in @xcite , and by arad @xcite who considered the commuting case as a base for perturbations to derive a partial no - go theorem for quantum @xmath8 .",
    "notably , this approach is the underlying motivation in the recent works of hastings @xcite and hastings and freedman @xcite , which are tightly related to the current paper , as they both attempt to make progress on the @xmath3 conjecture by studying approximations of @xmath2s .",
    "freedman and hastings are searching for hamiltonians whose low energy states are all highly entangled , and in particular can not be generated by constant depth quantum circuits ( such hamiltonians are called @xmath59 for no low - energy trivial states ) .",
    "the existence of such hamiltonians is essential for the @xmath3 conjecture to hold , for otherwise it would be possible to provide a classical witness for the fact that the energy of the hamiltonian is low , placing the problem in @xmath1 .",
    "freedman and hastings @xcite construct a family of @xmath2s which is not @xmath59 but only `` one - sided '' @xmath59 ( see also @xcite for more on this ) ; they leave as an open problem whether true @xmath59 hamiltonians exist .",
    "theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] can be applied here to derive an energy _ upper bound _ above which such a construction _ can not _",
    "be @xmath59 , since it shows the existence of trivial states below a certain threshold constant fraction of energy .",
    "we note that this upper bound tends to @xmath35 as the local expansion of the graphs underlying the construction improves , and so one can not hope to achieve better @xmath59 constructions by improving the local expansion of the underlying graph .",
    "we finally mention an important recent work discovered independently and around the same time as ours , by brando and harrow @xcite .",
    "brando and harrow showed that the approximation of @xmath9-local hamiltonians on graphs whose degree is very large lies in @xmath1 ( the factor of approximation depends inverse polynomially on the degree ) .",
    "this also implies that when the underlying graph of the @xmath9-local hamiltonian is an excellent expander ( which means that its degree must be very large ) the approximation problem ( to within a factor which depends inverse polynomially on the degree again ) lies in @xmath1 .    both the result of @xcite and our main theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] have the same flavor : too good expanders are an obstruction to quantum hardness , contrary to what one might expect given what we know in the classical case ( @xcite , and theorem [ thm : nphard ] ) .",
    "the comparison between the two results , however , is not straight - forward , and in particular none of the results implies the other .",
    "first , theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] holds for any constant locality @xmath60 , while the result of @xcite holds only for @xmath25 .",
    "one might ask what does theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] give if we substitute @xmath25 ; this turns out to be non interesting from the approximation point of view : it is exactly the result @xcite , which states that the _ exact _",
    "@xmath9-local @xmath2 problem lies in @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is unclear whether the results of @xcite can be extended to @xmath6-local hamiltonians , for @xmath27 .",
    "the straight forward attempt to do this , using quantum gadgets @xcite , that transform @xmath6-local hamiltonians @xmath61 into @xmath9-local hamiltonians encounters an immediate obstacle : these gadgets ( e.g. the best known gadgets so far @xcite ) significantly change the geometry of the graph , and in particular , may modify its expansion properties considerably .",
    "specifically , they introduce large sets of vertices with no edges between them , with some vertices having very small degree ; this implies that the results of @xcite will no longer be applicable after such transformations .",
    "our main result implies that surprisingly , good local expansion is an obstruction to quantum hardness of approximation , in the case of commuting local hamiltonians .",
    "it implies that if @xmath3 were to hold for @xmath2s , then the output of the @xmath3 reductions can not be good local expanders .",
    "our result also directly implies that @xmath59 hamiltonians ( see discussion in the previous subsection as well as @xcite ) can not be constructed on too good bi - partite local - expanders .    the main insight underlying this work is that local hamiltonian systems made of commuting check terms , are severely limited by a phenomenon called _ monogamy of entanglement_. essentially",
    ", the monogamy of entanglement limits the amount of entanglement that a qudit with @xmath62 quantum levels can `` handle '' .",
    "our study of commuting system thus reveals that monogamy of entanglement is a significant limiting factor , whose influence increases together with expansion .",
    "it is intriguing that a similar phenomenon has been identified by completely different methods , by @xcite in the context of general ( non - commuting ) local hamiltonians of locality @xmath25 .",
    "a natural open question is to generalize both our result and that of @xcite into one coherent stronger result , which would state roughly that for general , not necessarily commuting , @xmath6-local hamiltonians ( for general @xmath6 ) , the expansion of the underlying interaction graph ( where expansion is defined suitably ) is an obstruction against quantum hardness .",
    "another problem , is to generalize the results here and those of @xcite to richer forms of entanglement .",
    "in particular the limitation on quantum hardness need not necessarily come in the form of constant - depth circuit , but rather any form of entanglement which has an efficient description .",
    "we mention another interesting direction : one might hope that theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] could be extended to show that the approximation of the @xmath2 problem on a _ general _ graph is in @xmath1 , by `` bridging '' between our results on locally - expanding graphs and the easy case of approximation on lattices .",
    "we note that a hint about the difficulty of such a result comes from the status of the unique - games - conjecture @xcite which is known to be easy on both extreme cases @xcite ( albeit for standard expander graphs rather than for locally - expanding graphs ) , though conjectured ( or rather , speculated ) to be @xmath1-hard in general .",
    "still , it may be possible to achieve some weaker approximation for general graphs using `` bridging '' between the case of lattices and expanders , perhaps using sub - exponential rather than polynomial witnesses , following the works of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "a constraint @xmath132 is called * isolated * if for any constraint @xmath133 except @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 . we define the * isolation penalty * of @xmath134 , to be the minimal number of constraints in @xmath77 that we need to remove so that @xmath134 is isolated .",
    "we thus can `` isolate '' @xmath13 by removing all terms that share at least @xmath9 vertices with @xmath13 .",
    "this is where we use the local - expansion property : by fact [ fact : essence ] the set of constraints we need to remove constitutes just a small portion of the terms intersecting @xmath13 .",
    "the remaining terms that intersect @xmath13 , intersect it at only one particle .",
    "corollary ( [ cor : bv ] ) can now be applied almost directly on @xmath13 .",
    "the final result is that the term @xmath13 can be separated from the remaining terms and can be viewed ( up to the relevant isometries , and after a restriction to one of the subspaces in each qudit ) as acting on a separated subsystem .    to approximate the @xmath2 problem in @xmath1 ,",
    "it is not enough to remove for each term , all terms that make it isolated ; this will require removing way too many terms .",
    "instead , we use the above idea iteratively , and count how many terms we need to remove more carefully . at each iteration",
    "@xmath136 we choose a local term @xmath137 and `` isolate '' it ( see figure [ fig : ex1 ] ) .",
    "corollary ( [ cor : bv ] ) can then be applied , and @xmath137 can be separated from the rest , after restricting each of its qudits to its relevant subspaces .",
    "some qudits may interact , following this process , with only a single local term of the hamiltonian , thereby allowing us to remove them .",
    "we can now iterate this process , picking another local term ; this way we gradually `` tear away '' local subspaces of particles .",
    "the analysis of the upper bound on the number of terms that need to be removed altogether is non - trivial , since the number of particles does not necessarily decrease through one iteration ; it is only their _ dimensionality _ that decreases .",
    "we resort to an _ amortized _ analysis counting the total number of _ local dimensions _ ( namely , the sum over the particles of the local dimension of each particle ) that are removed in total . to the best of our knowledge this amortized counting of local dimensions is novel .    note that removing terms here is done not in order to _ disconnect _ parts of a graph , but only to isolate terms ; loosely speaking , to make the interaction pattern more sparse .",
    "this allows a much more economic removal of terms , and enables us to achieve the desired result .",
    "we are now ready to prove our main theorem :    ( of theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] )    let @xmath22 be an instance of @xmath20 , and let @xmath131 be its bi - partite interaction graph .",
    "we shall find a state whose energy approximates the ground energy of @xmath22 , ( we note that the same procedure can be applied to the approximation of any eigenvalue of @xmath22 ) .",
    "we perform an iterative process . at step @xmath136",
    ", we have a set of remaining terms @xmath138 acting on the remaining hilbert space @xmath139 .",
    "we also have a set @xmath140 which are terms we have collected so far that we want to throw away .",
    "we initialize @xmath141 , i.e. the set of all local terms of @xmath22 , and @xmath142 to be the empty set .",
    "we also initialize @xmath143 .",
    "repeat the following :    1 .",
    "* isolate * pick an arbitrary local term @xmath86 in @xmath138 . and isolate it ( definition [ def : isolate ] ) by removing as few as possible terms from @xmath138 , placing them in @xmath140 .",
    "* isometries * now that @xmath86 is isolated , the conditions of corollary [ cor : bv ] hold : there is a tensor product of @xmath28-local unitaries on the qudits of @xmath86 : @xmath144 , such that applying @xmath145 allows to restrict the hilbert space to some strict subspace containing the zero eigenspace of @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , inside this subspace , the term @xmath86 acts on a disjoint subsystem than the rest of @xmath138 .",
    "we conjugate @xmath86 , and each term of @xmath138 by @xmath145",
    ". we then _ prune _ : remove any triviality we encounter , be it removing qudits from hamiltonian terms or entire terms altogether . after pruning , each local term acts non - trivially on all the qudits that are attached to it .",
    "* update * we set @xmath146 as the set of remaining local terms of @xmath138 after this pruning , and then update @xmath147 as the support of @xmath146 .",
    "we then set @xmath148 as the union of @xmath149 and the term @xmath150 restricted to the appropriate subspaces of its qudits , as in corollary [ cor : bv ] .",
    "we terminate when there is no longer any intersection between two different terms of @xmath138 .",
    "clearly , this ends after at most polynomially many iterations , since the number of terms in @xmath138 decreases by at least @xmath28 each iteration .",
    "let the number of iterations be @xmath151 .",
    "we claim that a state whose energy is within @xmath152 from the ground energy of the original hamiltonian , can be recovered from this procedure by finding the ground state of all terms in @xmath153 , and applying the inverse of the isometries applied along the way .",
    "this is true as long as the subspaces in the direct sum that are chosen at step @xmath136 , contain the groundspace of the current hamiltonian @xmath138 ; the @xmath1 prover can provide the indices of the subspaces so that this holds at each step , and the verification procedure is simply to check that those subspaces contain a non - zero kernel .    to see that this implies a constant - depth quantum circuit that generates a groundstate ,",
    "observe that all isometries on a given qudit @xmath102 , produced along the way as a result of isolating all local terms from @xmath154 on @xmath102 , commute by definition , and so we can apply them in any order , and in particular , simultaneously .",
    "their application causes the interaction graph to break into linearly many connected components of size at most @xmath6 each , and so each component can be trivially diagonalized .",
    "the composition of these local diagonalizing unitaries , and the tensor - product isometries results in a circuit of depth @xmath9 ( just as in @xcite ) .",

    "we define for each @xmath161 , the quantity @xmath162 which is the number of check terms removed to @xmath163 during the @xmath136-th step , multiplied by the ratio @xmath164 , where those degrees are taken from @xmath157 .",
    "this accounts for the `` relative penalty '' shared by @xmath102 , w.r.t .",
    "@xmath157 - note that for any iteration @xmath136 , @xmath165 is exactly the number of check terms removed at the @xmath136-th iteration .",
    "hence @xmath166 for any @xmath167 , and any @xmath161 , we have @xmath168 .    we know",

    "so , at each step , when isolating a term acting on a set of particles @xmath170 , we remove at most @xmath171 constraints . by definition ,",
    "@xmath172 .",
    "on the other hand , let us calculate how many qudit dimensions we remove at such an iteration , out of the total number of qudit dimensions ( namely , the sum of dimensions over the particles).-level qudit by @xmath28 , the dimension of the total hilbert - space is reduced by a factor of @xmath173 ; here we are interested however not in the standard dimension of the entire hilbert space but in the _ sum _ of local dimensions over all particles .",

    "thus , the total number of local dimensions removed by one application of \" isolate  is at least @xmath174 .",
    "we observe by the above that every qudit @xmath155 participates in at most @xmath7 iterations .",
    "we would like to sum its relative penalties @xmath162 over those iterations .",
    "by fact ( [ fact : penalty ] ) this sum is at most @xmath175 .",
    "we would now like to sum over all @xmath155 ; by equation [ eq : totalpenalty ] this will upper bound @xmath152 .",
    "we have @xmath176 therefore , the relative penalty satisfies @xmath177 as required .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : nphard ] relies on the fact that the output of the @xmath8 reductions in dinur s proof @xcite can be made into an excellent locally - expanding graph without harming the promise gap , by a small modification of her construction .",
    "we provide here only a sketch of the proof , assuming the reader is familiar with @xcite .",
    "providing a self contained proof will require essentially repeating dinur s @xmath8 proof .",
    "( of theorem [ thm : nphard ] ) let us denote by @xmath178 @xmath179-local @xmath30s acting on bits .",
    "note that instances of @xmath178 are special cases of @xmath20 for @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "suppose that for given parameters @xmath182 we are also given @xmath4 , for which @xmath183 .",
    "the theorem will follow for these parameters @xmath184 if we show that it is even @xmath1-hard to approximate @xmath178 whose bipartite interaction graphs are @xmath4-locally - expanding , to within @xmath55 .    to do this ,",
    "recall that dinur provides in @xcite a @xmath8 reduction which maps any @xmath9-local @xmath30 instance on @xmath12 variables of alphabet @xmath185 , @xmath186 , to a @xmath30 instance of @xmath187 size , such that the new instance has constant promise gap , say , @xmath188 .",
    "we modify her construction so that the output @xmath30 is @xmath179-local , acting on bits , has local expansion error @xmath4 , and the promise gap is larger than @xmath55 where @xmath55 is @xmath188 divided by the loss in the promise gap introduced by the alphabet reduction step in dinur s construction ; this factor is bounded by a universal constant independent of the parameters of the problem @xcite .    to achieve this",
    "we make a small modification of dinur s gap amplification procedure .",
    "recall that this procedure consists of iterating three steps : the _ preprocessing _ step in which the graph is made into a @xmath7-regular expander graph , _ gap amplification _ in which the @xmath30 is translated into another @xmath30 , whose new @xmath9-local constraints are defined using conjunctions of constraints in the original @xmath30 along collections of @xmath136-walks ( walks of length @xmath136 ) , thereby significantly amplifying the promise gap of the instance , but increasing the size of the alphabet , @xmath189 , to be doubly exponential in @xmath136 ; and finally _ the alphabet reduction _ in which a @xmath9-csp instance alphabet @xmath190 , is translated into a @xmath179-local on bits , with some small constant factor loss in the promise gap .",
    "we denote @xmath188 divided by this loss to be @xmath55 . as a final sub - step , the output @xmath179-local @xmath30",
    "is translated into a @xmath9-local @xmath30 on alphabet of size @xmath191 . by every such @xmath179-step iteration",
    ", the gap is amplified by some constant larger than @xmath28 .",
    "we apply dinur s procedure , until the output is a @xmath192 with promise gap at least @xmath188 .",
    "now we add one additional iteration , in which we make two modifications .",
    "first , we choose the parameter @xmath136 , defined to be the length of walks in the gap amplification step , in such a way that @xmath189 , the size of the new alphabet , which is doubly exponential in @xmath136 , satisfies @xmath193 where @xmath194 , and @xmath195 is some combinatorial constant to be determined below .",
    "second , we skip the very final step where @xmath179-local constraints are translated into @xmath9-local constraints .",
    "finally , regardless of how the alphabet reduction is defined in previous iterations ( there are several versions of dinur s proof ) apply at the final iteration alphabet reduction using dinur s variant @xcite of the long code test ( @xcite ) .",
    "we claim that the resulting @xmath30 is a @xmath179-local @xmath30 whose underlying bi - partite graph has @xmath4 local expansion , and whose promise gap is at least @xmath55 .",
    "the fact that the promise gap is at least @xmath55 follows from the fact that we have applied dinur s iteration to achieve promise gap at least @xmath188 , and then the alphabet reduction reduces it to at least @xmath55 regardless of the alphabet size ( this is how we have defined @xmath55 ) .",
    "let us now show why the local expansion error is at most @xmath4 . let @xmath88 be some set of @xmath179 bits .",
    "the local expansion error of @xmath88 can be bounded from above by @xmath196 , where @xmath197 as in the proof of fact ( [ fact : essence ] ) .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to lower bound @xmath119 and show it is at least @xmath198 .",
    "we consider in more detail the long - code construction used in the alphabet reduction .",
    "this step associates with each @xmath9-local constraint acting on two large alphabet variables ( each is of dimension @xmath189 ) with @xmath194 bits , which are supposed to be the long - code encoding of the assignments to those two large alphabet variables .",
    "those bits are called @xmath199 bits ; for each such @xmath75-tuples of bits , the long - code constraints ( called @xmath199 constraints ) are @xmath179-local constraints , one for each triplet among those @xmath75 bits .",
    "in addition , we add for each @xmath189-size variable @xmath189 bits that are responsible for the _ consistency _ of this variable in all constraints it appears in .",
    "these @xmath189 bits are thus called @xmath200-type ; the consistency constraints ( @xmath200-constraints ) , act on one @xmath200-type bit , and two @xmath199-bits from the long - code encoding of a given constraint .",
    "we note that choosing any two bits of the @xmath200 constraint determines the third bit .",
    "we first observe , that the only interesting @xmath88 s are those that have at least @xmath9 @xmath199-type bits in some long - code encoding of the _ same _ constraint .",
    "this is because in all the other cases , either no constraint can intersect @xmath88 in more than one bit ( this is the case when @xmath88 contains no @xmath199 bits , or it contains @xmath179 @xmath199 bits , all from the long - code encoding of different constraints ) or the number of constraints that can intersect @xmath88 in two bits is at most @xmath9 ( this is the case if @xmath88 contains one @xmath199 bit only , or if @xmath88 contains @xmath9 @xmath199 bits , but from _ different _ long - code encodings ) . since all other constraints intersect @xmath88 in exactly one bit , @xmath119 is close enough to @xmath28 .",
    "so we are left with the case that @xmath88 has at least @xmath9 bits in the same long - code encoding .",
    "the fraction of @xmath199 constraints that intersect @xmath88 in @xmath9 places , out of all possible @xmath199 constraints that intersect it , is at most @xmath201 ; the number of @xmath200 constraints that intersect @xmath88 in @xmath9 places , is at most @xmath179 since every two bits determine the third in a @xmath200 constraint .",
    "thus , the fraction of @xmath200 constraints that intersect @xmath88 in two bits , out of all @xmath200 constraints that intersect @xmath88 , is @xmath201 .",
    "thus , the expansion error in this case is at most @xmath201 , which , by choosing @xmath195 correctly in the choice of @xmath136 above , is @xmath202 .",
