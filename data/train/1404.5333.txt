    "in march of 1916 , @xcite and @xcite showed that the old quantum theory of @xcite and @xcite can account for an effect discovered by and named after @xcite , the splitting of the spectral lines of hydrogen atoms placed an external electric field .",
    "this result was hailed as a tremendous success for the old quantum theory .",
    "@xcite boasted that  the reported results prove the correctness of bohr s atomic model with such striking evidence that even our conservative colleagues can not deny its cogency . \" in the conclusion of the first edition of his _ atombau und spektrallinien _ , the bible of the old quantum theory , @xcite called the theory s explanation of the stark effect one of  the most impressive achievements in our field \" and a  capstone on the edifice of atomic physics . \"    however , as we noted in an earlier paper @xcite , the old quantum theory s explanation of the stark effect was not without its share of problems .",
    "these problems were solved when , shortly after the arrival of schrdinger s ( 1926a ) wave mechanics , @xcite and @xcite produced an account of the stark effect in the new theory . in this paper , we focus on two of these problems and show how they are resolved in wave mechanics .    first , we show how the new quantum mechanics takes care of a fundamental problem one runs into when applying the old quantum theory to the stark effect .",
    "it turns out that the allowed orbits of the electron in the hydrogen atom , with or without an external field , depend on the coordinates in which the quantum conditions are imposed . the allowed energy levels and",
    "hence the line splittings do not depend on the coordinates used but the size and eccentricity of the elliptical orbits do . in the new quantum theory , this worrisome non - uniqueness of orbits turns into the perfectly innocuous non - uniqueness of bases in hilbert space .",
    "second , we show how wave mechanics does away with another problem in the old quantum theory , namely the need for extra restrictions on the allowed orbits over and above the basic quantum conditions .",
    "we review how the so - called wkb approximation method for solving the schrdinger equation , named after @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , reproduces the quantum conditions of the old quantum theory amended by some additional half - integer terms . with these additional terms",
    ", there is no need anymore for extra restrictions on the allowed orbits .",
    "we will proceed as follows . in section 2",
    ", we use the old quantum theory to find the formula for the energy levels for the first - order stark effect , i.e. , the energy of the allowed orbits of an electron in a hydrogen atom placed in a weak electric field , to first order in the strength of that field .",
    "we show that the old quantum theory calls for some arbitrary restrictions on the allowed orbits over and above the basic quantum conditions . in section 3",
    ", we present the problem of the non - uniqueness of the orbits in the old quantum theory . in section 4 ,",
    "we sketch how the formula for the energy levels in the stark effect is derived in wave mechanics .",
    "we only present the first part of this derivation in detail .",
    "this suffices to show how wave mechanics avoids the need for extra restrictions on the allowed quantum states . in section 5 ,",
    "we show how the problem of the non - uniqueness of the orbits is solved in modern quantum mechanics . in section 6 ,",
    "we use the wkb method to find approximate solutions to the schrdinger equation to recover the quantum conditions of the old quantum theory from wave mechanics with correction terms of @xmath0 .",
    "these correction terms remove the need for extra restrictions on the allowed orbits in the old quantum theory . in section 7 , we summarize our conclusions .",

    "such a motion , with zero angular momentum , is classically impossible , of course , but we have left the realm of the classical hamilton - jacobi equation by including ( in a limited way ) quantum - mechanical effects .",
    "in the mid-1920s , a number of physicists working on the old quantum theory became increasingly suspicious of the notion of electron orbits . in the transition from the old quantum theory to both matrix mechanics and wave mechanics ,",
    "orbits were discarded altogether ( see @xcite for the case of matrix mechanics ) . what we have shown in this paper , using the account of the stark effect in the old and the new quantum theory as a striking example ,",
    "is that orbits had become highly problematic well before the developments of the mid-1920s .",
    "the most important theorists working on the stark effect  sommerfeld , epstein , and kramers ( schwarzschild died shortly after making his contribution)were well aware of these difficulties , especially of the two problems that we focused on in this paper . yet , they offered only stopgap solutions for one of these problems and essentially ignored the other .",
    "the two problems were the following .",
    "first , the relation between the quantum numbers for energy and angular momentum was such that the basic quantum conditions had to be supplemented by some ad - hoc extra conditions to rule out various pathological orbits ( see section 2 ) .",
    "second , the orbits selected by the quantum conditions of the old quantum theory depend on the coordinates in which these conditions are imposed ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the new quantum theory avoids both problems ( see section 4 ) . in sections 5 and 6",
    ", we used the new theory to elucidate the problems in the old one .",
    "the first problem could be fixed systematically with the help of the new theory ( see section 6 ) .",
    "the new theory , however , also makes it painfully clear that the second problem just goes to show that orbits are ill - suited to represent physical states in atomic physics . the problematic relation between the quantum numbers for energy and angular momentum",
    "could be fixed by amending the basic quantum conditions of the old quantum theory , replacing many but not all integer quantum numbers by half - integer ones . in section 6",
    ", we reviewed how these amendments can be derived using the wkb approximation method for finding approximate semi - classical solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "if the motion in a particular coordinate is a libration , half - integer quantum numbers should be used ; if it is a rotation , integer quantum numbers should be used . even though physicists in the early 1920s realized that one often obtained better results with half - integer quantum number than with integer ones",
    ", they did not provide any systematic justification for using one rather than the other .",
    "in fact , the extra terms and factors of @xmath0 introduced in this period turned out to come from a variety of sources , including the as yet undiscovered electron spin .",
    "it was only with the arrival of the new quantum theory that a systematic justification for these extra terms and factors could be given .",
    "as we saw in section 6 , the wkb method provided an important part of that justification .",
    "the other problem , the non - uniqueness of the quantized orbits , strikes right at the heart of the old quantum theory .",
    "its residue in the new quantum theory is that the eigenstates found by separating and solving the schrdinger equation in one set of coordinates can always be written as a superposition of the eigenstates found by doing so in another set of coordinates .",
    "this , of course , is no problem at all .",
    "but rather than showing how to solve the non - uniqueness problem in the old quantum theory , this evaporation of the problem in the new quantum theory merely shows that , contrary to one of the main articles of faith of the old quantum theory , orbits can not be used to represent physical states in atomic physics .",
