    "[ fig - multcmd ] to illuminate the dependency of the color uncertainties on the brightness of the detected pms stars .",
    "the errors derived from the incompleteness are significantly lower than the photometry errors , and therefore are not considered here . a reasonable explanation for the observed widening of the distribution of the pms stars could be their photometric errors . however , the observed broadening is wider than the mean photometric errors per magnitude range . for stars with @xmath1 @xmath40  23.5 mag the sequence of pms stars",
    "is found to cover a color range of at least 5@xmath34 or more ( @xmath34 being the typical color uncertainty ) , while for fainter stars with 23.5 @xmath40  @xmath1 @xmath40  25.5 mag , this range becomes at least 3@xmath34 wide .",
    "this implies that the photometric errors alone can not account for the observed spread in the whole magnitude range of the pms stars .",
    "another factor expected to move pms stars away from the colors and magnitudes predicted by models is their binarity .",
    "using the simulations of the pms population with @xmath41  mag and @xmath42  mag of @xmath34 ori by sherry et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we expect at the distance of ngc  346 ( @xmath43  mag ) a brightness spread of @xmath44 0.75 mag .",
    "the difference in magnitudes between the pms models for 1.5 and 15 myr , for the same magnitude and color limits , is @xmath44 2.5 - 1.6 mag , at least twice as large as the spread produced by binarity .",
    "it is almost certain that the pms stars of ngc  346 are t  tauri stars , as can be seen from a comparison of their loci in the cmd with the location of t  tauri stars observed , for example , in the orion ob1 association in the milky way ( briceo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these stars are known to exhibit optical variability , that could cause the pms spread observed in our cmd .",
    "the variability in the @xmath1-band for classical t  tauri stars ( cttss ) shows an amplitude up to 3 mag , while for weak - line t  tauri stars ( wttss ) the variability is between 0.05 and 0.6 mag ( herbst et al .",
    "1994 ) . in young ( 3 - 5 myr ) star forming regions",
    "the ordinary fraction for cttss is 30% - 50% ( preibisch & zinnecker , 1999 ) , but this fraction decreases with age so that by an age of a few myr most low - mass pms stars are wttss ( sherry et al . 2004 ) .",
    "if we assume that this region is indeed very young , then we should consider that no more than 50% of the t  tauri stars in our sample are cttss .",
    "these pms stars are characterized by irregular photometric variability ( e.g. sherry 2003 ) and therefore it is quite difficult to estimate the probability of observing them near the extreme limit of their variability . on the other hand ,",
    "the photometric variability of these objects is extremely rapid ( e.g. sherry 2003 ) and consequently the probability of observing its extreme limit is very low . under these circumstances ,",
    "a percentage of about 50% of cttss in our sample can only partly account for the observed spread .",
    "if we consider that the region is older , as suggested by massey et al .",
    "( 1989 ; @xmath36  12  myr ) , then the probability that the observed widening due to variability is even smaller , since these stars would be mostly wttss .",
    "differential reddening is probably the most important factor that might produce the observed broadening . in   2 ,",
    "we derive the individual interstellar reddening for each of the ob stars within the association .",
    "this leads to an estimation of their color excess @xmath30 and consequently their individual extinction @xmath23 from their un - reddened color indices @xmath28 , and reddening - free @xmath26 parameters (   [ sec - difred ] ; table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we find that extinction varies from @xmath32 0.06 to 0.39 mag ( with a peak at @xmath45 0.13 mag ) .",
    "such an extinction - spread corresponds to a spread in color excess between @xmath46 0.03 and 0.20 mag , which is much smaller than the observed widening in color of the sequence of pms stars . on the other hand , if we consider the reddening distribution based on the upper ms stars of the entire observed region ( fig .",
    "[ fig - genred ] ; @xmath47  mag ) , then reddening becomes a very important factor for the observed pms broadening . a further support to the crucial role of reddening",
    "is given by the comparison of the spatial variations in the locus of the pms stars with the reddening map of the observed region derived in ",
    "[ sec - red ] ( shown in fig.[fig - genred ] left ) and the spatial variations of the reddening of the central 31 ob stars (   [ sec - difred ] ) .",
    "this comparison shows that indeed the pms stars located in the more reddened areas seem to occupy a preferentially redder locus in the cmd .",
    "the importance of reddening is demonstrated below with the use of simple simulations of the observed loci of pms stars in the cmd .",
    "we discussed above several factors that may explain the observed pms spread in ngc  346 , and we find that none of them can actually produce this spread in the observed degree _ if it acts alone_. however , one should consider that these factors are not isolated phenomena , but , on the contrary , they are expected to act on the observed stellar parameters in a cumulative manner . taking this into account , we simulate the observed widening of the pms assuming that the `` suspected '' factors act in an additive way on a sequence of single - age pms stars .",
    "we constructed a toy model of the observed pms stars , assuming that all stars are the product of a single star formation event .",
    "then , we applied each of the aforementioned biases .",
    "we conclude from this test that a single - aged pms population can indeed be misinterpreted as the product of star - formation events that took place during different periods .",
    "the apparent age spread can be the product of the cumulative action of several factors .",
    "an example of the results of our toy model is given in fig .",
    "[ fig - sim ] , where we assume that the observed pms population of ngc 346 is 4 myr old .",
    "first , we assume a concentration of pms stars , as they are selected in paper i according to their location in the cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig - sim]_a _ ) , which populates a single 4  myr pms isochrone ( fig .  [ fig - sim]_b _ ) .",
    "then we apply the effects of the suspected factors one on top of the other . here",
    "we describe the procedure :    * _ binarity _ : as far as the existence of unresolved binaries in our sample concerns , there are no studies on the expected fraction of binary systems in associations of the magellanic clouds .",
    "therefore , we based our simulations on the information we have on galactic ob associations .",
    "these systems show a binary fraction that does not differ significantly from the field ( mathieu 1994 ) , which is found for g dwarfs to be around @xmath36 58 % ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) . the well - studied orion nebular cluster ( onc )",
    "is also found to be consistent with the field binary fraction ( e.g. prosser et al .",

    "2006 ) . in many clusters ,",
    "a clear binary sequence is observed to lie 0.75 magnitudes above the single star main sequence ( tout 1991 ) , and this is almost equal to the brightness shift that a single star will suffer toward brighter magnitudes , if it is an unresolved binary system with equal mass components ( de bruijne et al .",
    "+ simulations of unresolved low - mass pms stars in the orion ob1b association centered on @xmath34 ori by sherry ( 2003 ) showed that for a 3 myr old binary system with a 0.5 m primary the position of the system on the @xmath0 , @xmath1 cmd can be shifted up to 0.13 mag on the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the actual shift depends on the mass of the lower - mass companion , which ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 m. this system also brightens by slightly less than 0.75 magnitudes .",
    "it should be noted that recent observational studies on the mass ratios of t  tauri binaries are consistent with a uniform distribution of mass ratios between 0.2 and 1.0 ( woitas et al .",
    "2001 ) . in order to simulate the effect of unresolved binaries to the modeled sequence of 4 myr old pms stars we randomly applied a brightening of no more than @xmath48 1 mag and a reddening @xmath40  0.13 mag , assuming different binary fractions .",
    "it is worth noting that elson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) measured a binary fraction in the young rich lmc cluster ngc  1818 , and found @xmath49% in the core .",
    "this is roughly comparable to the galactic values which are considered here . in fig .",
    "[ fig - sim]_c _ ( top panel ) the result for a binary fraction of 50% is shown .",

    "_ variability : _ in order to simulate the effect of variability on our modeled sequence of pms stars , we assigned to each star a random amplitude drawn from a gaussian probability distribution , following sherry ( 2003 ) , who assumed normally distributed @xmath1-band variations in wttss with a mean of @xmath50 mag and a standard deviation of @xmath51 0.1 mag , based on data for 42 wttss with known @xmath1-band variations .",
    "the @xmath0 colors of these stars should appear redder when they are fainter , due to rotational modulation . according to herbst et al .",
    "( 1994 ) the ratio of color variations , @xmath52 , ranges from 0.39 to 0.88 mag .",
    "we assumed several values for this ratio within these limits . in fig .",

    "it should be noted that for these results we assumed that only wttss are present at the assumed age of ngc  346 .",
    "this is certainly the reason for a rather small effect on the variability in our simulations . in the case",
    "that some fraction of cttss had also been included , the spread implied by the model could be as large as 5 times more , due to the higher amplitude these stars exhibit . *",

    "this would also be the result for the ( more accurately measured ) reddening found for ob stars .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sim ] _ e _ , high extinction is indeed the most important factor , in addition to binarity , that can cause the observed broadening of single - age pms stars . *",

    ", we randomly applied the observed mean photometric errors per magnitude ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - multcmd ] _ right _ ) to the modeled pms population .",
    "naturally , the derived broadening is wider for the fainter stars .",

    "[ fig - sim]_f _ ( top panel ) .    from the results of our toy model for the influence of several factors on a `` perfect '' single - age sequence of pms stars",

    "we specifically note the importance of reddening and binarity of such stars for this broadening .",
    "variability may also play an important role depending on the nature of these stars . although each of these factors acting alone can not cause the observed widening of pms loci in the cmd",
    ", it is their cumulative action that leads to the broadening of the sequence of pms stars in ngc 346 .",
    "however , it should be noted that if indeed reddening is the most important cause for this widening , then the pms population of ngc  346 should be expected to be older than 3 - 5 myr , since reddening `` pushes '' pms stars to redder colors making them appear _",
    "younger_. specifically , pms models for ages on the order of 10 myr proved to fit the observed sequence of pms stars and their broadening better .",
    "this result is in line with massey et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , who claim that although the location of the bright stars of ngc  346 in the cmd implies an age of less than 5  myr for the association , there is a spatial distinct subgroup of evolved @xmath36  15  m stars _ in the association _ with ages @xmath55  12  myr .",
    "furthermore , another very interesting result of our simulations is that the possibility of multi - epoch star formation can not be excluded .",
    "specifically , our toy model showed that if we consider that the interstellar reddening may be lower than what was previously assumed ( using e.g. @xmath56  mag found from the ob stars in the region of the association ) , then the observed spread of the pms stars can only be reproduced by ( at least ) two separate pms isochrones .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - sim ] ( bottom panel ) , where we show the results of the toy model if two star formation events around 4 and 10 myr ago are assumed . in this figure",

    "typical ages derived from the simulations of a double star formation event ( half of the stars formed in each epoch ) are 3 - 4 and 10 - 12 myr in agreement with both hypotheses . conclusively",
    ", we _ can not _ completely exclude the possibility of a true age spread of the sequence of pms stars in ngc  346 due to separate star formation events .      in order to study variations in the cmd we selected a region of size 15 @xmath7 12 , centered on the association ngc  346 .",
    "this region was divided into 20 18@xmath718  sub - regions .",
    "indeed , we see that the cmds differ from one region to the next in the nature of the stars , their numbers and the apparent pms broadening .",
    "the individual cmds of all sub - regions are shown in fig .",

    "pms isochrones are overplotted only for sub - regions 11 to 15 , so that a rough estimation of the age differences can be extracted .",

    "[ fig - cntr346 ] , it can be seen that pms stars are present in almost the entire selected region , except for the southwestern ( sub - regions 5 and 10 ) and northeastern ( sub - region 16 ) areas , which are located away from the association ( and the nebula ) . from the cmds of the remaining sub - regions",
    "we can conclude that pms stars seem to follow the southeast ( bottom left corner ) to northwest ( top right corner ) direction of the _ nebulosity _ , with a higher concentration in the main body of the association ( sub - region 13 ) and around it ( e.g. sub - regions 12 , 14 and 18 ) .",
    "reddening in the selected region is expected to be higher in the part centered on the main body of ngc  346 due to the nebula , and indeed the corresponding cmds exhibit the wider broadening in their pms populations .",
    "this suggests that reddening _ is _ indeed ( at least partly ) responsible for the observed pms broadening .",
    "this is more clearly seen in the cmd of sub - region 13 , the best representative of the population of the association ( similar to the cmd used in our toy - model ) .    from the discussion",
    "so far on the pms stars of association ngc  346 alone we _ can not _ safely conclude that these stars represent a coherent population , formed in a single star formation event .",

    "however , taking into account the low reddening found from the ob stars in the association , we tend to conclude that a true age spread may also contribute to the observed pms broadening .",

    "[ sec - pms ] , it is worthwhile to specify the limits within which their ages may range , in order to identify any age - differences between them . therefore , the stellar populations of the pms clusters are analyzed in terms of their cmds shown in fig [ fig - pmsclus ] ( bottom ) .",
    "isochrone models for both ms ( girardi et al .",

    "these models suggest that cluster 1 is in a rather evolved state with the best fitting pms model indicating an age range of 5 to 15 myr .",
    "the stellar content of this cluster , which also includes a few bright ms stars , suggests that it should be treated as a small open cluster rather than a recently formed pms cluster .",
    "the models indicate that all the remaining pms clusters seem to be much younger than cluster 1 .",
    "specifically , clusters 2 to 4 do not exceed an age of 5 myr , with clusters 2a , 2b and 3 being the youngest in the sample with ages for their pms stars younger than 2.5 myr .",

    "differential reddening is found to play an important role in the broadening of the pms stars in the cmd .",

    "this is demonstrated in fig [ fig - pmsclus ] for the cmd of cluster 2a , where we plot the pms isochrones assuming three cases : no reddening ( dash - dotted lines ) and reddening values of @xmath57  0.08  mag ( found from the upper main sequence for the whole region ; dashed lines ) and @xmath57  0.04  mag ( found from the ob stars in the association ; long - dashed lines ) .",
    "the spread of the pms stars in the cmd of cluster 5 covers a wider range of ages , comparable to the one we observe in the main body of the association ngc  346 ( discussed in  3 ) .",
    "this is not a surprising result considering that cluster 5 is the closest pms cluster to the association , and probably it shares the same star formation history with it .",
    "in general , from the individual cmds of the pms clusters ( except for cluster 1 , which is a rather evolved open cluster with a pms population ) we see that the northern part of the observed field ( north of the association ) covers younger clusters of pms stars than in the southern part and the association itself .",
    "it will be discussed below whether this is an indication that these clusters do not share the same star formation history with ngc  346 , but rather that they are the products of more recent star formation .",
    "the degree of clustering of pms stars can be evaluated through their surface density as a function of angular separation from each star .",
    "gomez et al . ( 1993 ) applied this technique to the study of the spatial distribution of pms stars in the taurus - auriga molecular cloud , and they found that a power law form ( with index @xmath58 ) reproduces the overall shape of the actual pms distribution in taurus , indicating the presence of real clustering .",
    "larson ( 1995 ) extended the analysis of gomez et al .",
    "to smaller separations and he measured a power - law relation @xmath59 for young star clusters , where @xmath60 is the surface density of pms stars , and @xmath61 the angular separation from each star .",
    "he found that the taurus young stars exhibit self - similar or fractal clustering on the largest scales , but there is a clear break from self - similarity at a scale of about 0.04 pc which divides the regime of binary and multiple systems on smaller scales from that of true clustering on larger scales .",
    "a survey of young clusters in the orion , ophiuchus , chamaeleon , vela , and lupus star - forming regions by nakajima et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed an index for @xmath62 of @xmath63 at stellar separations in the binary regime , smaller than 0.1 pc , whereas at large separations ( 0.1 to 1.0 pc . )",
    ", the power index seems to vary from region to region with @xmath64 .",
    "the break in the power law was found to occur on physical scales of 0.01 to 0.1 pc .",
    "pudritz ( 2002 ) argues that this spatial range probably does not reflect the initial conditions for isolated star formation in clusters , because a star moving at @xmath65 in such a cluster will move a distance of 1.0 pc in a million years , thereby erasing the initial conditions .",
    "according to larson , the power law break provides clear evidence for an intrinsic scale in the star formation process , which is found to be essentially equal to the jeans length in typical molecular cloud cores .",
    "he also notes that there is evidence that nearly all stars are formed in binary or multiple systems , and that some of these systems are subsequently disrupted by interactions in the denser star - forming environments to produce the observed mixture of single , binary and multiple stars ( larson 1995 ) .",
    "goodwin et al . ( 2007 ) review the observed properties of multiple systems and find that the multiplicity of stars changes , probably due to the dynamical decay of small - n systems and/or the destruction of multiple systems within dense clusters .",
    "they note that models of the fragmentation of rotating and turbulent molecular cores almost always produce multiple systems , but the properties of those systems do not match the observations .",
    "ob associations are known to contain subgroups of smaller clusters ( blaauw 1983 ) , which often contain smaller groups of stars themselves , made of multiple - star systems .",
    "efremov & elmegreen ( 1998 ) suggest that star formation is generally clumped into a hierarchy of structures , from small multiple systems to giant star complexes and beyond and that ob associations are just one level in this hierarchy .",
    "even the ism has been observed to be arranged in a hierarchical structure ( scalo 1985 ; vzquez - semadeni 2004 ) .",
    "turbulent motions have been proposed as a cause for the hierarchical structure ( elmegreen 1998 ) .",
    "the velocity structure in turbulent regions is suggested to be scale - free , meaning that _ the same physical processes and the same velocity - separation relations occur over a wide range of absolute scales _ ( elmegreen 2006 ) . according to this hypothesis ,",
    "large clumps originate from the large velocities which compress the gas on large scales and small clumps result from the compression of the gas characterized by small velocities on small scales . considering that stars are formed by the collapse of such hierarchical structured clumps , they are themselves hierarchically structured . the break in the power - law relation @xmath66 defines the two different regimes of star formation : the binary regime at smaller scales , and the regime of hierarchical clustering at larger ones .    in order to determine the clustering properties of the pms clusters found in the region of ngc  346 , we apply the same technique and construct the average surface density of companions @xmath62 for every pms member of each of the pms clusters as a function of the angular projected separation @xmath61 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - clsd ] ) .",
    "we apply a linear fit for the estimation of the power law index , @xmath67 .",
    "the function @xmath62 drops sharply near the largest separations owing to the size of the region selected for each cluster .",
    "consequently , our analysis is based only on the smaller observed separations .",
    "in addition our observations do not allow us to separate stars in the binary regime and , therefore , our study does not include them .",
    "the errors shown in fig .  [ fig - clsd ] reflect the low number statistics in our samples of pms stars per cluster .",
    "the derived values of the power - law index for all clusters are found to be in the narrow range @xmath68 , comparable to the results of nakajima et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for separations in the regime of hierarchical clustering .",
    "the power - law index relates to the nearest - neighbor distance , in the sense that if the latter can be fitted by the poisson distribution , then the power index is close to 0 .",
    "the distribution of the nearest - neighbor distance is much broader than the poisson one , when the surface density varies appreciably within the region .",
    "then @xmath62 has a steep @xmath61-dependence , and the power - law index is negative ( nakajima et al .",
    "1998 ) , comparable to the values we find for our clusters .",

    "in addition , four of the pms clusters we identified earlier (  4 ) coincide with `` definite '' ysos ( clusters 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) . according to simon et al .",
    "( 2007 ) the spatial distribution of the ysos reveal that star formation in n  66 did not proceed from the southwest toward the center of the h ii region as proposed by massey et al ( 1989 ) .",

    "in this paper we present the results from our photometric study on the recent star formation history of n  66 the brightest h  ii region in the smc , related to the ob association ngc  346 , as it is recorded in the observed pms population of the region .",
    "our deep photometry revealed an extremely large number of low - mass pms stars in the association and the surrounding region , easily distinguishable in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 cmd .",
    "we show that factors such as reddening , binarity and variability can cause a broadening of the positions of these stars in the cmd of the association , wide enough so that they can be misinterpreted as the result of multi - epoch star formation , and not as the product of a single star formation event .",
    "we found that a modest reddening like the one we found for the general area of ngc  346 ( @xmath77 mag ) can make the pms stars appear younger than what they actually are , and therefore an age of 10 myr better fits the observed sequence of pms stars .",
    "however , our results do not exclude the possibility of multi - epoch star formation in the area of the association if the reddening is even lower , as suggested from the ob stars of this region ( @xmath78 mag ) . in this case , two star formation events 10 and 5 myr ago can explain the observed broadening of the pms stars due to age spread and factors such as reddening and binarity .",
    "no specific dependence of the estimated ages of the pms stars to their loci within the association , as a signature of sequential star formation , was found .",
    "it has been previously suggested that three different generations of stars occurred through sequential star formation in the region of ngc  346/n  66 ( rubio et al .",
    "2000 ) within the last 3 myr ( based on the age of the youngest ob stars ) and that the pms stars of ngc  346 represent a star formation event that took place 3 - 5 myr ago ( nota et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , the study by massey et al .",
    "( 1989 ) based on the presence of evolved 15  m stars suggests that there might have been earlier star formation events in the region making ngc  346 as old as @xmath36  12 myr .",
    "in addition , there are recent indications that ngc  346 might host classical be - type stars ( evans et al .",
    "2006 ) , and if so , the age of the association should be at least 10  myr , a threshold given by fabregat & torrejn ( 2000 ) for classical be - type stars to form .",
    "these results fit very well to the hypothesis that star formation in ngc  346 did already occur about 10  myr ago , as our observations and simulations of the pms stars suggest .    from star counts based on our acs photometry",
    "we identify at least five pms clusters across the region , covering a range of ages . on spatial scales from 0.8@xmath2 to 8@xmath2 ( 0.24 to 2.4pc at the distance of the smc ) the clustering of the pms stars as computed by a two - point angular correlation function is self - similar with a power law slope @xmath79 .",
    "the clustering properties are quite similar to milky way star - forming regions like the orion ob association or @xmath4oph .",
    "thus molecular cloud fragmentation in the smc seems to proceed on the same spatial scales as in the milky way .",
    "this is remarkable given the differences in metallicity and hence dust content between smc and milky way star - forming regions .",
    "the youngest pms stars are located mostly to the north of the bar of n  66 , where three pms clusters are identified .",
    "this area is also characterized by a high concentration of candidate ysos ( simon et al .",
    "2007 ) , h - excess stars ( found with our photometry ) , and ir - emission peaks ( rubio et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this indicates that star formation probably still takes place in an arc - like feature , as it is outlined by the spatial distribution of these sources . in an accompanying letter , we combine these results with previous multi - wavelength studies of the region to investigate the star formation history , which helped to shape ngc  346/n  66 ( gouliermis et al .",
