    "the classical metallic - line stars of the upper main sequence ( often denoted as am / fm or cp1 stars ) , are a- to early f - type objects @xcite . these stars , as such ,",
    "were first described by @xcite using spectra of hyades cluster members . in general , am stars are characterized by overabundances of metallic elements heavier than iron , whereas calcium , scandium , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen are underabundant .",
    "there are two different models based upon atomic diffusion to explain the am phenomenon .",
    "@xcite proposed that the separation of chemical elements occurred just below the hydrogen convection zone where calcium has a small radiative acceleration .",
    "this implies that on the main sequence ( ms ) a very small mass fraction has anomalous abundances . in the subgiant phase",
    ", the anomalies will be diluted due to the increased mixing . in the other model , proposed by @xcite ,",
    "the separation occurs much deeper in the stellar interior .",
    "therefore , on the ms , a much larger mass fraction has anomalous abundances . as a consequence ,",
    "the chemical peculiarities remain for a longer time as the star evolves on the subgiant branch : the abundance anomalies remain visible till convection dominates .",
    "the chemical separation resulting from atomic diffusion can affect both the surface and interior of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars @xcite and the mass in the different convection zones and internal elemental concentrations can be already modified before a star arrives on the ms .",
    "the amplitude of the internal abundances depends on the stellar mass ; equivalently , the age at which abundance anomalies appear at the stellar surface also depends on the stellar mass . in the presence of weak mass loss , and",
    "no turbulent mixing , rotation or magnetic fields , significant internal variations and surface anomalies can appear already after about 2myr in early a - type stars , and at about 20myr in cooler f - type stars . to constrain these models",
    "it is essential to know when the am phenomenon first appears on the pms , but a pms am star has not yet been found so far .    for another group among the chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars ( the magnetic bp / ap objects ) , there were already efforts to identify representatives on the pms .",
    "however , up to now only one possible candidate with weak ap / bp peculiarities ( v380 ori a ) was detected @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite presented the time - dependent evolution of chemical abundances for ( ms ) cluster bp stars . a similar approach for am objects and the detection of a pms prototype is important to provide further observational constraints to the diffusion theory and on the time - scale of the evolution of the chemical abundances of cp stars .",
    "in order to search for pms cp stars , observations of open clusters are preferable because they contain samples of stars of well constrained age and homogeneous initial chemical composition , characteristics suited for the study of processes linked to stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ targetstar ]",
    "we describe the open cluster and the target star .",
    "a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the target star is presented in section [ sect : specanalysis ] .",
    "these results are essential to provide further constraints on the cluster membership and evolutionary stage ( section [ sect : clustermember ] ) . in section [",
    "sect : discussion ] we discuss the results , and section [ sect : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "the young open cluster stock16 is located in the hii region rcw  75 , which furthermore appears to be part of the extended associations cen  ob1 and cen  r1 @xcite .",
    "the first detailed investigation of the cluster was carried out by @xcite in the photographic _ rgu _ system , followed by the photoelectric @xmath4 study by @xcite .",
    "later on , @xcite presented a deep ccd multi - colour investigation and identified several pms objects .",
    "finally , @xcite studied the cluster in the @xmath5 photometric system as part of a survey to detect cp stars .",
    "all mentioned studies agree in the obtained cluster parameters . using the individual results , we derived the average values @xmath6  mag for the reddening and 1910@xmath185pc for the distance .",
    "since the cluster s metallicity is not known , which strongly influences the distance determination , the uncertainty on the distance is very probably underestimated .",
    "we therefore adopt a more realistic value of about 10 per cent ( @xmath7200pc ) . in the literature @xcite the cluster age",
    "is estimated to be between 3 and 8myr .",
    "hence , at such a young age , cluster stars with spectral type a and later are most likely still in their pms stage . fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] shows the dereddened colour  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the cluster .",
    ", otherwise the average @xmath8  mag was applied .",
    "the average cluster distance of 1910pc was used to derive the absolute magnitudes .",
    "the isochrones for 3 , 5 , and 8myr by @xcite , which include the pms phase , are shown as solid lines .",
    ", width=321 ]    note that the cluster position given in simbad and in the open cluster data base webda @xcite disagrees by about 10 arcmin with the one used by all the aforementioned studies . because of this offset , @xcite obtained for the cluster a rather low stellar density contrast to the background .",
    "however , this study derived values for the age and the distance similar to the ones of stock  16 listed above , but a reddening lower by @xmath70.2mag .",
    "nevertheless , this provides a further proof of a young area , which probably exhibits strong differential reddening .",
    "the ob association cen ob1 was studied by @xcite based on strmgren photometry for two dozen stars .",
    "they obtained a distance of @xmath72.3kpc , an age of about 9myr , and a strong differential reddening in @xmath9 between 0.3 and 1.1mag , not uncommon for a dusty region .",
    "@xcite derived a somewhat larger distance of @xmath72.6@xmath10.5kpc , an average radial velocity of = @xmath1020.0  and an average proper motion of @xmath104.78@xmath10.10/@xmath100.93@xmath10.10 mas yr@xmath11 .",
    "the latter is identical to the one listed by @xcite for stock  16 ( @xmath105.0@xmath10.4 / @xmath100.9@xmath10.4 mas yr@xmath11 )",
    ". a much closer distance of 1.8@xmath10.4kpc was instead found by @xcite .",
    "they attribute the large difference to an overestimation of the absolute magnitude when using spectral types and standard relations .",
    "hence , as already pointed out by @xcite , there is a strong evidence that stock  16 is a member of an extended structure , which includes at least one further confirmed young open cluster ( ngc 4755 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with parameters nearly identical to that of stock  16 .",
    "the photometric study by @xcite detected a probable cp star in the area of stock  16 ( stock  16 - 12 : v@xmath713.4mag , j2000 ra 13:18:51 , dec .",
    "@xmath1062:29:22 ) due to a positive peculiarity index ( @xmath5=+24mmag ) .",
    "such a value is in general indicative of characteristics typical of magnetic cp stars @xcite .",
    "later , the star was classified as a2si with strong metals by @xcite based on a low - resolution spectrum ( 2pixel@xmath11 ) .",
    "the problems arising in the classification of the various peculiar groups are extensively discussed by @xcite , and one also can not exclude a bias in the classification process due to the measured @xmath5 . however , the noticeable strong metals are already a hint for a later type star and hence a possible nature as metallic - line ( am ) star as found in section [ sect : specanalysis ]",
    ". only some representatives of this group show positive @xmath5 values , but @xcite used the apparent and not intrinsic colours for the diagnostic @xmath5 diagram .",
    "the somewhat lower reddening of stock  16 - 12 compared to the cluster s mean ( see discussion in section [ sect : clustermember ] ) shifts the star to redder colours in the diagram , resulting in an insignificant @xmath5 value .",
    "we obtained an additional spectrum of this star with the 2.15 m telescope at the complejo astronmico el leoncito ( casleo ) on 2012 may 11 using the same configuration as given by @xcite , except for a small shift in the blaze angle . with the new information provided in the present paper",
    ", we would classify stock  16 - 12 as ka2ha3ma7 based on the ca ii k , hydrogen , and metallic lines .",
    "there are no noticeable differences between the two available low resolution spectra , though both exhibit a low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath725 .",
    "we therefore decided to acquire an additional higher quality spectrum for a detailed analysis , which is presented in section [ sect : specanalysis ] .",
    "we obtained one spectrum of stock16 - 12 on 2013 may 20 with the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) of the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "this is a cross - dispersed chelle spectrograph , which in the standard mode and the adopted configuration ( 1 arcsec slit width , red arm , and grating # 520 ) yields a resolving power of 40000 . with exposure time of 3000s , at an airmass of 1.35 and a seeing of about 0.9 arcsec , we obtained a s / n pixel@xmath11 at @xmath125500  of 210 .",
    "all reduction steps were performed within the uves pipeline ( version 5.2.0 ) and .",
    "neither binning nor smoothing was applied to the chelle spectrum .",
    "the spectrum , normalized by fitting a low order polynome to carefully selected continuum points , covers the wavelength range 41706200 , with a 60  wide gap at about 5200 .    to analyse the spectrum , we computed model atmospheres of stock16 - 12 using the  stellar model atmosphere code @xcite .",
    "for all the calculations local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) and plane - parallel geometry were assumed .",
    "convection was implemented according to the @xcite model of convection ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "we used the vienna atomic line database ( vald ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a source of atomic line parameters for opacity calculations and abundance analysis .",
    "we measured the radial velocity ( ) and the projected rotational velocity ( ) by fitting synthetic spectra , calculated with  @xcite , to the observed profiles of weakly blended lines , obtaining = @xmath1018.0@xmath11.0  and = 68.0@xmath14.0 .",
    "to determine the fundamental atmospheric parameters we used both hydrogen and metallic lines . to spectroscopically estimate the effective temperature ( ) and surface gravity ( ) from hydrogen lines , we fitted synthetic line profiles to the observed h@xmath13 and h@xmath14 lines .",
    "the adopted spectral synthesis code , , incorporates the algorithm by @xcitebarklem / hlinop.html ] which takes into account not only self - broadening but also stark broadening ( see their section 3 ) .",
    "the fit to the two covered hydrogen lines led to = 8100@xmath1400k and = 4.0@xmath10.4  dex ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hydrogen ] ) .",
    "the rather large error bars are due to uncertainties in the normalization and to the small , thought not negligible , sensitivity of the hydrogen line wings to gravity variations .",
    "the metallic - line spectrum provides further constraints on the atmospheric parameters .",
    "the presence of rather strong line blending , due to  and to the overabundance of various elements , did not allow us to measure spectral lines with equivalent widths .",
    "we therefore analysed the metallic lines using synthetic spectra .",
    "we first selected the least blended metallic lines with a well defined continuum level and then , for a given set of atmospheric parameters ( , , and microturbulence velocity  ) , fit the abundance of each selected line using the tools described in @xcite .",
    "we repeated this operation for a set of atmospheric parameters ranging from 8000 to 9000k in , from 3.6 to 4.5  dex in , and from 2.0 to 5.0  in .",
    "we adopted steps of 100k in , 0.1dex in , and 0.1  in .",
    "for each given set of atmospheric parameters and abundances we then calculated a synthetic spectrum covering the observed wavelength range .",
    "we finally determined the overall ( excluding the regions covered by the hydrogen lines and the naid lines at @xmath125892  affected by strong  effects ) best fitting synthetic spectrum , hence set of atmospheric parameters and abundances , using @xmath15 statistics .    in the considered temperature regime and in particular for the spectral region bluewards of h@xmath14 , the continuum level is extremely sensitive to temperature variations .",
    "this would lead to the introduction of a bias in the @xmath15 minimization if applied using an observed spectrum with a fixed normalization , i.e. the @xmath15 would be driven mostly by the fit to the continuum level , rather than by the fit to the metallic lines . to avoid this problem we renormalized the observed spectrum in order to perfectly match the continuum level of each calculated synthetic spectrum . in this way , variations of the @xmath15 are due exclusively to the quality of the fit of the single spectral features . using this technique we obtained = 8700@xmath1200k , = 4.2@xmath10.4dex , and = 3.7@xmath10.3 .",
    "the two adopted parameter indicators did not lead to consistent effective temperature values .",
    "this could be due to various systematics affecting the determination of the atmospheric parameters (  in particular ) with the adopted indicators .",
    "in particular hydrogen lines recorded with chelle spectra are usually difficult to normalize . in this case , the normalization of the hydrogen lines was particularly uncertain due to the ` wavy ' shape of the not - normalized reduced spectrum .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that a determination of the atmospheric parameters based on the abundance fit of metallic lines might lead to an overestimation of the effective temperature of up to a few hundreds of kelvin .",
    "on the basis of these considerations we finally set the effective temperature at = 8400@xmath1400k and the surface gravity at = 4.1@xmath10.4dex . having fixed  and  we then used the metallic lines and the method described above to determine the best - fitting , obtaining = 3.4@xmath2 .     and h@xmath14 line profile ( black solid line ) and synthetic profiles calculated with the final adopted parameters ( dash - dotted green line ) and with the parameters which were found to best fit the hydrogen line profiles ( dashed red line ) .",
    "the h@xmath13 line profile was rigidly shifted downwards by 0.2 .",
    "the wavelength dimension has been converted in velocity and centred at the laboratory wavelength of the h@xmath14 and h@xmath13 lines , respectively .",
    "bottom panel : difference between the synthetic and observed h@xmath13 and h@xmath14 line profiles rigidly shifted respectively downwards and upwards by 0.05 .",
    "the line colours and styles are as for the top panel.,width=321 ]    the only way to solve the problem of the discordant effective temperature values would be to use further parameter indicators , such as photometry , which could be directly converted to fundamental parameters (  and ) or calibrated to physical units to fit the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "unfortunately , both methods are strongly affected by interstellar reddening , which for the stock16 open cluster is not known well enough to ensure an effective temperature determination more reliable than that provided by the hydrogen and metallic lines . furthermore , a slight differential reddening in the young cluster results in a large uncertainty if using the mean reddening of the cluster .",
    "we finally measured the abundance of 18 elements ( see table  [ tab : abundances ] ) obtaining an abundance pattern which well resembles that of cp metallic - line stars ( am stars ) .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] shows the derived abundance pattern , relative to that of the sun @xcite , in comparison with the average abundance of the am stars member of the praesepe open cluster @xcite and of the ap star hd204411 which has an effective temperature similar to that of stock16 - 12 @xcite .",
    "the abundance pattern of stock16 - 12 presents all classical chemical signatures of am stars : underabundances of c , n , o , ca , and sc , as well as overabundances of fe - peak and rare - earth elements .",
    "stock16 - 12 shows also a slight overabundance of na , which is not classically considered as a cp element in am stars , though @xcite found it to be systematically overabundant in each analysed am star , and @xcite found it to directly correlate with fe in early f- and a - type stars .",
    "note that we determined the sodium abundance using the lines at @xmath125688  which are very little affected by  effects ; we did not use the naid lines at @xmath125892  which would instead lead to a strong na overabundance due to  effects .",
    "the strong blending did not allow us to measure the abundance of other elements which are known to be overabundant in am stars ( i.e. , v , co , cu , zn , zr , pr , sm , gd , dy , ho , er , and yb ) .",

    "for this reason , and given the large difference in  obtained using hydrogen and metal lines , it is important to check the abundance pattern still resembles that of an am star when accounting for the uncertainty on .",
    "the abundances of stock16 - 12 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] present two error bars , where the larger one takes into account also the uncertainty due to an increase in  by 400k .",
    "even with the larger uncertainty the abundance pattern of stock16 - 12 resembles well that of am stars , confirming therefore its classification .",
    "the rather large  value we derived from the uves spectrum is in line with that typical of am stars @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the behaviour of the microturbulence velocity in very young ( pms ) stars is not yet understood .",
    "abundance analysis of young stars in the same temperature regime of stock16 - 12 shows an average  value between 2.5 and 3  @xcite , slightly enhanced compared to that of ms stars of the same temperature , though somewhat smaller than what we obtained for stock16 - 12 .",
    "this further strengthens the conclusion that stock16 - 12 is a cp am star .",
    "however , cp am stars are commonly found in close binary systems @xcite .",
    "to check whether stock16 - 12 is member of a close binary , we derived the star s radial velocity from an interrupted uves exposure , obtained within the same service mode observing programme on 2013 april 28 ( exposure time 722s ; s / n pixel@xmath11 at @xmath125500  of 49 ) , and two further uves spectra obtained within a director s discretionary time ( ddt ) programme on 2014 april 12 with exposure times of 1205s and a s / n of 56 and 52 , respectively . using the same method",
    "as applied on the high s / n spectrum , we measured a consistent radial velocity of = @xmath1018.0@xmath11.0 .",
    "thus , we conclude that stock16 - 12 is probably not in a binary system , unless it is a wide binary with a period of several years .    to gather more information on the cp nature of the star , we obtained focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph 2 ( fors2 ) spectropolarimetric observations to attempt the detection of a large scale magnetic field .",
    "the fors2 low - resolution spectropolarimeter @xcite is attached to the cassegrain focus of the 8-m antu telescope of the eso vlt of the paranal observatory .",
    "the observations were performed using the 2k @xmath17 4k mit ccds ( pixel size 15@xmath18m@xmath1715@xmath18 m ) and a slit width of 1.0 arcsec in order to collect more photons and increase the s / n .",
    "we also adopted the 200khz / low/1 @xmath17 1 readout mode and the grism1200b .",
    "each spectrum covers the 37005100  spectral range which includes most of the balmer lines , except h@xmath19 , and a number of metallic lines .",
    "the star was observed once on 2014 april 18 with a sequence of spectra obtained rotating the quarter waveplate as follows : @xmath1045@xmath20 , @xmath2145@xmath20 , @xmath2145@xmath20 , @xmath1045@xmath20 .",
    "each of the four spectra was obtained with an exposure time of 1568 s which led to a stokes _",
    "i _ spectrum with a s / n pixel@xmath11 calculated at 4950  of about 1120 .",
    "we reduced and analysed the fors2 data using the routines and technique described in @xcite and references therein , without detecting a magnetic field : by using the whole spectrum we obtained an average longitudinal magnetic field value  of @xmath1011@xmath176 g , while using the hydrogen lines we obtained  = @xmath10193@xmath1129 g .",
    "hence , there is no evidence for a magnetic field with a strength typical of that of ap stars .",
    "three previous studies list the object analysed here as member of stock  16 @xcite , whereas @xcite denoted the star as probable non - member by means of ccd @xmath22 photometry .",
    "this last classification is probably due to the deviation from the cluster sequence in the @xmath23 cmd , since in all other colours no disagreement is noticeable .",
    "however , compared to the photoelectric @xmath24 measurement by @xcite , the ccd study provided a much redder colour by 0.14mag .",
    "this can be attributed to well known difficulties in reproducing the standard @xmath24 colour with ccds ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore adopt the photoelectric measurement for this colour .",
    "the remaining colours in common between the investigations are in excellent agreement , also if compared with measurements by the aavso photometric all - sky survey [ apass , data release 7 ( dr7 ) ] , which provides data in the @xmath25 filters .",
    "since the cluster is located at a distance of @xmath71.9kpc , proper motion as membership criterion is in general not that efficient anymore compared to nearby open clusters . nevertheless , the average cluster motion given by @xcite is in agreement with that listed in the ucac4 @xcite and ppmxl @xcite catalogues : @xmath105.7/3.0 ( @xmath12.7 ) and @xmath105.7/5.5 ( @xmath19.8 ) mas yr@xmath11 , respectively .",

    "hence , within the errors , the object lies on or slightly below the lower reddening border . on the other hand",

    "this corresponds to more than three times of the total error budget , calculated using the error propagation by @xcite including @xmath33=0.2 and the individual photometric errors .",
    "this is an indication for the presence of circumstellar material around a young ( pms ) object .",
    "therefore , a connection with the young environment is most likely . on the other side of the covered wavelength range",
    "one can also notice emission in the near - uv , which is in general a sign of accretion .",
    "however , the position of the uvot _",
    "uvm2 _ filter coincides with the uv bump at 2175  of extinction curve models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore strongly affected by systematic uncertainties in the extinction law .",

    "although uv spectra are preferable , also observations in the additional uvot bands ( _ uvw1 _ and _ uvw2 _ ) could provide hints about its strength and the real nature of the possible uv excess . the deviation observed at uv wavelengths could be also explained by an underestimation of the effective temperature or an overestimation of the interstellar reddening .",
    "note however that a decreased reddening would lead to a worse fit of the other available photometry and that the excess in the uv is still present when using a higher effective temperature , i.e. 8800k .",

    "d__=2.4kpc , = 8976k , and _ _ r__=3.3r@xmath32 ( their model i d 3017872 ) .",
    "the extinction value is close to the one adopted above , the distance is in reasonable agreement to that reported for stock  16 , and the temperature only slightly above the spectroscopic range ( = 8400@xmath1400k ) .",
    "the latter can be explained by the somewhat higher reddening and to some extent also by the use of solar metallicity models in the fitting tool .    in consideration of all available information",
    "we therefore conclude that a foreground position of the target star can be excluded and a membership to stock  16 or the young association is instead very likely .",
    "this is also justified by the reasonable agreement of the positions in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) using the cluster distance and the purely spectroscopic results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hrd ] ) .",
    "we would like to point out that a correction of the object s brightness by 0.75mag ( binarity with mass ratio @xmath36 ) results in an exceptional good coincidence with the spectroscopic luminosity value ( indicated by the cross in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrd ] ) .",
    "however , a binary nature is unlikely as discussed in section [ sect : specanalysis ] .",
    "nevertheless , the position above the zams supports the pms nature inferred from the ir - excess , especially if considering the more precise cluster distance .",
    "the interpolation within the pms evolutionary tracks by @xcite results in 2.3@xmath10.2m@xmath3 and an age of 4@xmath11myr for the ` photometric ' position in the hrd , whereas the purely spectroscopic one indicates 1.95m@xmath3 and 6myr . in the last case , the uncertainty especially in age is very large , reaching @xmath715myr towards the zams .",
    "the derived ages are well in line with the age of stock  16 listed in the literature ( 38myr ) .",
    "-band magnitude , cluster distance and spectroscopic temperature ( black circle and error bars ) , and corrected for binarity with @xmath36 ( cross ) .",
    "furthermore , the purely spectroscopic results were transformed to the temperature / luminosity plane ( grey square and error bars ) .",
    "the pms tracks for solar metallicity with standard prescriptions by @xcite are indicated as solid lines , whereas zams , ms , and post ms tracks are given as comparison by dashed lines.,width=321 ]",
    "in the previous sections we have shown that stock  16 - 12 is an intermediate - mass pms star , which already shows all abundance characteristics of a cp am star .",
    "the estimated stellar age of 46myr is of extreme importance because it allows one to put an observational upper limit on the time - scale of diffusion processes . to our knowledge",
    ", the only work which presented stellar models with atomic diffusion for pms stars is @xcite .",
    "the earliest appearance of noticeable surface abundance anomalies strongly depends on the mass , whereas low mass loss rates influence the amplitude of peculiarities .",
    "previous calculations , able to reproduce the observed abundances , have already shown that low mass - loss rates ( @xmath37m@xmath32yr@xmath11 ) for am stars are likely @xcite .",
    "the evolution of ca abundance presented by @xcite is probably of particular interest , since this element shows a strong variation with age .",
    "as can be recognized in their fig .",
    "1 , the higher mass models ( @xmath381.9m@xmath32 ) predict a short duration ( @xmath391myr ) of underabundance , followed by an abrupt change to even significant overabundances .",
    "the underabundance dips are located at about 3.5 and 6.5myr for the 2.5 and 1.9 m@xmath32 models , respectively .",
    "these ages are well in line with our results for the mass , age , and the derived ca underabundance for stock  16 - 12 .",
    "however , there is a strong temperature dependency ( see table [ tab : abundances ] ) for this element , resulting in even slight overabundances at the adopted upper age limit",
    ". nevertheless , also the evolution of other presented elements ( e.g. o , mn , or ni ) is in agreement with the age and abundance pattern of stock  16 - 12 .",
    "probably the least agreement can be found for fe , which needs , according to the lower mass models , too long to show the measured overabundance of @xmath70.4dex , but the 2.5m@xmath32 model shows a small peak ( @xmath70.15dex ) at the same age as ca discussed above .",
    "the fe abundance at the lower border of the adopted temperature range would also be in reasonable agreement to the model .",
    "also the higher abundance for this element might be reproduced , though with a much lower mass loss rate than @xmath40m@xmath32yr@xmath11 used by @xcite .",
    "however , also a slightly higher initial metallicity of the host cluster ( and thus also of the star ) can be responsible .",
    "chemical peculiarities in am stars seem to depend also on the stellar rotational velocity @xcite , but it is unsure whether this holds also for pms stars .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth to obtain a hint of the expected rotational velocity at the zams . based upon the pms models by @xcite , which include the rotational evolution ,",
    "the equatorial velocity of the object will be increased by about 30 per cent , though their comparison of the models with the measured rotation rates of herbig ae / be objects shows only a poor agreement . assuming that the measured  represents roughly the true rotational velocity , the target star would reach a velocity of about 90  at the zams , which is close to the upper end of the velocity distribution of am stars @xcite .",
    "the possible uv excess ( see discussion in section [ sect : clustermember ] ) , which could be interpreted as accretion , has also natural consequences on the elemental distribution in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "if further observations indicate that accretion is still in process , the rate has to be smaller than @xmath41m@xmath32yr@xmath11 to have no influence on the chemical separation @xcite .",
    "our non - detection of a magnetic field does not rule completely out the presence of a magnetic field , since the star might have been observed at an unlucky phase .",
    "therefore , one can not exclude that the star is magnetic and that the current am abundance pattern of stock  16 - 12 might change before the star reaches the zams in order to match that of magnetic cp stars .",
    "so far , v380 oria is the only candidate which shows weak ap / bp peculiarities @xcite and a magnetic field .",
    "since the star is about twice as massive as stock  16 - 12 , its evolution is much faster too .",
    "additional spectropolarimetric observations for stock  16 - 12 and the detection of more cp pms stars would be essential to test this hypothesis .",
    "we presented here a detailed parameter determination and abundance analysis for the star stock  16 - 12 . from the spectroscopic data we determined a temperature of 8400@xmath1400k , a surface gravity of = 4.1@xmath10.4dex , and a microturbulence velocity of = 3.4@xmath2 .",
    "additional spectroscopic data allowed us to conclude that the object is probably a single star .",
    "furthermore , we have not detected a magnetic field using spectropolarimetric observations obtained at one epoch .",
    "the star s abundance pattern resembles well that of cp metallic - line ( am ) stars .",
    "all currently available data suggest that the star is a member of the very young ( 38myr ) open cluster stock  16 , or at least to belong to the young cen ob1 association in which the cluster is embedded .",
    "depending on the adoption of either the purely spectroscopic results or the cluster distance , we determined a stellar mass range of about 1.952.3m@xmath3 .",
    "the membership to a very young region , the noticeable ir - excess , and the stellar age of 46myr inferred from evolutionary models allow us to conclude that the object is still in its pms stage .",
    "this star is probably the second pms cp object known so far , and the very first showing typical am star elemental abundances .",
    "young cp stars are extremely important to test and constrain the theory of atomic diffusion .",
    "current available stellar evolutionary models are well in line with our results for the stellar mass , age , and the derived elemental abundances .",
    "however , the further evolution of stock  16 - 12 is unclear , in particular if the star hosts a structured magnetic field . in this case",
    ", the star might develop its current am abundance pattern into that of ms magnetic cp stars before it reaches the zams .",
    "additional spectropolarimetric measurements and the detection of more cp pms stars are needed to test this hypothesis .",
