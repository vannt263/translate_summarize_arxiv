    "the galactic plane survey ( gps , * ? ? ? * ) is part of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , * ? ? ?",
    "the gps has covered the entire northern and equatorial galactic plane that is accessible to ukirt , surveying 1868 deg@xmath2 and providing @xmath3 photometry for @xmath41 billion stars .",
    "the survey includes two epochs of k band photometry , with the aims of ( 1 ) finding examples of brief and rarely observed phases of stellar evolution via detection of high amplitude variability and ( 2 ) providing a proper motion catalogue .",
    "there has not previously been a panoramic survey for variability in the galactic plane at near - infrared wavelengths , so even a 2 epoch survey represents an opportunity for new discoveries .",
    "this study provides a foretaste of the results that will come from the multi - epoch survey vista variables in the via lactea ( vvv , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the southern plane .",
    "high amplitude variability in the near - infrared can be produced by several physical phenomena . evolved giant and supergiant stars such as r cor bor stars , mira variables and oh / ir stars",
    "are known to display large variability at infrared wavelengths ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can show up as point sources in the search through the gps catalogues , and these objects are also variable in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "other known classes of infrared variable stars include symbiotic stars @xcite , cataclysmic variables / novae @xcite and classical be stars @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion on classes of near - infrared variable stars ) .",
    "eruptive pre - main - sequence ( pms ) are also among stars where high amplitude variability has been observed .",
    "this type of variable stars suffer episodic outbursts due to an abrupt increase in the mass accretion rate on to the central star , by a factor of up to 1000 .",
    "the sudden rises in luminosity , of up to 6 magnitudes , can persist from months to @xmath4100 yr @xcite",
    ". theoretical models of pms evolution of sun - like stars generally assume that they accrete matter from their circumstellar discs in a continuous fashion ( see discussion of some of the recent models in * ? ? ?",
    "they are assumed to gradually descend hayashi tracks on the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram until they approach the main sequence .",
    "however , two problems with this simple picture have persisted for @xmath420 years .",
    "the first is that hr diagrams of pms clusters typically show a wide scatter about the best fitting isochrone .",
    "the second is the `` luminosity problem '' ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which is that the typical luminosities of pms stars in clusters are lower than expected ( @xmath41  l@xmath5 ) for sun - like stars that should be above the main sequence .",
    "if eruptive variability is common amongst pms stars it can resolve both problems : low average luminosity would be due to the great majority of the cycle being spent in the slowly accreting state , whilst the scatter would be due to the lingering effects of the more dramatic accretion events on the location of each star in the hr diagram @xcite .",
    "if correct , this has serious consequences for the body of mass estimates of pms stars in the literature .",
    "@xcite estimate that masses could be overestimated by @xmath6 to @xmath7 for brown dwarfs and low - mass - stars with @xmath8 .",
    "these eruptive ysos have been classically divided into two sub - classes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : ( 1 ) fu orionis variables ( fuors ) , which show large increases in flux followed by a slow decay over @xmath910 yrs . while in outburst they present strong co absorption at 2.29 @xmath10 m with h@xmath11o absorption also present in their near - infrared spectrum . ( 2 ) exor variables that have recurrent short - lived ( @xmath121  yr ) outbursts and quiescent periods of 5 - 10 yrs .",
    "the ir spectrum is dominated by strong br@xmath13 in emission , with co bands showing in emission while in outburst and as absorption features while in quiescent states ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both classes commonly power outflows seen as herbig - haro objects and near ir h@xmath14 emission , although a direct connection between outbursts and the propagation of the jets is unclear .",
    "@xcite show that v2494 cyg would be the first fuor object to show such direct connection .",
    "these ( optically defined ) classifications struggle to include some intermediate objects and exclude younger protostars that have higher accretion rates but are too deeply embedded in circumstellar matter to be observed in the optical .",
    "just three optically invisible protostars have been confidently identified as eruptive variables , with @xmath15 bandpass variability in excess of 2 magnitudes : oo ser @xcite , v2775  ori ( = [ ctf93]216 - 2 ) @xcite and gm cha ( = iso - cha i 192 ) @xcite .",
    "a recent study of protostars in cygnus  ob7 found two more candidates that are currently under investigation , @xcite , whilst five more possible outbursting protostars are identified in @xcite .    a few others have been proposed as embedded fuor - like objects based only on their spectral characteristics , e.g. pp13s @xcite and ar6a+b @xcite . at present",
    "only @xmath410 fuors and 14 - 18 exors are known @xcite but spectroscopic and h@xmath14 studies of pms stars suggest that eruptive variability may be common or universal ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with variations only very rarely exceeding 1 mag in k. ysos are also known to vary at mid - infrared wavelengths ( see e.g * ? ? ? * ) and the same physical processes are not expected to produce variability larger than @xmath16  mag , whereas variations larger than @xmath17  mag are usually associated with eruptive variability ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein )",
    ". a higher incidence of @xmath15 bandpass variations @xmath91  mag ( @xmath18 ) has recently been reported in class  i ysos in the braid nebula within cygnus ob7 @xcite , which might be expected if fluctuations in the accretion rate are higher in these less evolved sources , which have a higher average accretion rate than the class ii and class iii ysos that dominate the other studies .",
    "two sources from @xcite and one source from @xcite were identified as possible eruptive variables , pending spectroscopic follow up .",
    "we note that variable extinction along the line of sight can produce large change in the magnitudes of ysos , such as the ones observed in ux ori - like or aa tau - like variables ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .",
    "this paper presents initial results of an ongoing project to perform an unbiased search for high amplitude near - infrared variables in the 2-epoch gps data",
    ". the main focus of this study will be the analysis of ysos , specifically likely young eruptive variable stars of the fuor / exor class .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : section 2 describes the methodology of the search for high amplitude variables in the 5th and 7th data releases ( hereafter dr5 and dr7 respectively ) of gps and how these objects represent a very small fraction of the stars in the studied sample of the survey ( @xmath4 1 every 262000 stars ) .",
    "we then go on to describe the locations and properties of the objects found in our searches .",
    "in addition we discuss how ysos are likely the dominant population of high - amplitude ( @xmath19  mag ) infrared variables .",
    "starting from section 3 we focus on the detailed analysis of objects arising from dr5 of gps ( the detailed analysis of dr7 objects will be the subject of a future publication ) . therefore section 3 describes follow up observations of dr5 objects ; in section 4 we detail the results of follow up spectroscopy and photometry , in section 5 we present a brief discussion and section 6 presents a discussion on variable stars not associated with star forming regions .",
    "we searched the gps for high amplitude infrared variables identified via the two epochs of @xmath15 band photometry , which provide a minimium time baseline of 2 years .",
    "we used sql queries of the wfcam science archive ( wsa , * ? ? ? * ) to select stars ( objects with image profile classifier _",
    "mergedclass=-1 _ ) that varied by @xmath20  mag , having @xmath21 mag in at least one epoch and for which no serious post - processing photometric errors are found ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the magnitude cut was designed to reduce the number of false positives , given that the faintest stars in crowded fields are the most likely to have incorrectly deblended fluxes .",
    "the cut used `` apermag3 '' , the default 2@xmath23 diameter aperture . in order to further decrease the number of contaminant sources we also made additional cuts on the ellipticity of the detections ( @xmath24 ) and in astrometric offsets between the observations (",
    "the detection in both epochs were required to be within @xmath25 from each other ) .",
    "the queries returned a large number of candidates and in order to remove false positives , images of each candidate were inspected visually .",
    "most false positives arose from bad pixels , diffraction spikes from bright stars or a small number of fields with bad astrometry .",
    "two epoch data were only available for a small proportion of the galactic plane at the time of the searches , as indicated in figure [ fig : gps_cov ] .",
    "the figure shows that the area covered is mostly located at galactic latitudes @xmath26 . in other words , two epoch data for the mid - plane were largely excluded from the available data releases .",
    "this is for historical scheduling reasons .",
    "this spatial bias in the initial results reported here will be eliminated in future searches as the dataset becomes more complete .",
    "the fact that the mid - plane is not covered , implies that relatively few star formation regions or young stellar populations with similarly small scale heights will be included in our search . to be more specific ,",
    "most star formation regions at heliocentric distances , @xmath27>@xmath28  kpc will be excluded , assuming a scale height of @xmath29  pc for molecular clouds located near @xmath30=@xmath31 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath15 band magnitude of the source is presented in column @xmath36 , where @xmath37 represents the @xmath15 band epoch with contemporaneous @xmath38 and @xmath39 photometry represents the earlier epoch , but this is not true for all gps sources . ] .",
    "the corresponding @xmath40 and @xmath41 colours are given in columns @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "column @xmath44 gives the @xmath15 band magnitude difference between the 2 gps epochs , @xmath45 .",
    "column @xmath46 presents @xmath47 , the absolute value of the peak - to - trough difference when using all of the available data from this work and the literature .",
    "finally , the number of epochs used in the calculation of the latter , @xmath48 , is given in column @xmath49 , whilst the data release from which the objects arise is given in column @xmath50 .",
    "the initial search was performed in the first tranche of two epoch gps variability data , which was released as part of dr5 , on 28th of august 2009 and covered 31 deg@xmath2 in the first galactic quadrant .",
    "the search yielded 672 candidates .",
    "after inspection of the images to remove false positives , only 17 stars remained , with magnitude variations up to @xmath51 mag ( where @xmath52 is the absolute difference between the two gps k band magnitudes ) .",
    "we conducted a second , similar search for extreme infrared variables in dr7 , which was released on the 10th of september 2010 and covered 155 deg@xmath2 , thus delivering an extra 124 deg@xmath2 of two epoch data ( the dr5 catalogue is embedded within the dr7 release ) .",
    "the query returned , after removal of candidates from dr5 , 3365 candidates .",
    "the removal of false positives by visual inspection of the images yielded 28 real variables .",
    "adding the results from the dr5 and dr7 searches yields a total of 45 high amplitude infrared variables .",
    "we note that the amplitude of the variations are always observed to be much larger than individual errors .",
    "the amplitudes observed at 2.2 @xmath10 m are also larger than the expected difference that arises from comparing different photometric passbands , e.g. ukidss @xmath15 vs 2mass @xmath53 , when ancillary data is available for the stars .",
    "just to emphasize how rare these events are within the surveyed area of the galactic plane , we note that when excluding the @xmath19   mag condition in our searches , @xmath54 million stars are selected from the dr7 catalogue ( which includes the dr5 release ) .",
    "this implies that high amplitude variability occurs in @xmath4 1 out of 262000 stars in gps .",
    "the colours and magnitudes of the 45 stars found in the analysis are shown in figures [ dr57cmd ] and [ nircdr57 ] , and listed in table [ table : par ] .",
    "two of the 17 variables in dr5 show blue colours .",
    "one of them was identified via simbad as nova sct 2003 @xcite corresponding to gpsv17 in table [ table : par ] .",
    "the other 16 stars from dr5 are unknown in the literature , except gpsv13 , which is listed in the @xcite catalogue of h@xmath55 emission line stars . also , some have previous detections in the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ) or the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "two stars arising from dr7 , gpsv38 and gpsv45 , present exceptionally red @xmath41 colours and @xmath56 mag .",
    "these correspond to the known oh / ir stars , glmp755 @xcite and iras 18396 - 0807 @xcite .",
    "oh / ir stars typically represent the most extreme oxygen - rich asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , with mass loss rates greater than 10@xmath57 m@xmath5yr@xmath58 .",
    "they are thought to be the extension towards longer periods and higher luminosities of mira variables @xcite , being more evolved and in some cases perhaps in the process of becoming planetary nebulae . given the higher mass loss rate , these objects are deeply embedded , being only detectable towards near - infrared wavelengths . thus these stars will likely be a source of `` contamination '' in our search for eruptive pms variables ( see discussion below ) .",
    "however , these are still interesting objects .",
    "the mid - infrared colours of two sources detected here put them at the red end of the sequence of colours predicted for o - rich agb stars with increasing mass loss @xcite in the work of @xcite , implying that these stars are about to leave the sequence to become planetary nebulae .            from the dr5 sample ,",
    "eight of the stars appear very red in colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmd , see left panel of fig .",
    "[ dr57cmd ] ) , i.e. redder than the giant branch plotted for stars in the vicinity .",
    "five of the remaining stars also appear quite red , being projected against the giant branch .",
    "these 13 `` red '' stars have colours indicating a @xmath15 band excess due to hot dust in our colour - colour diagrams , a common property of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars with accretion discs .",
    "in fact , most of them are consistent with being reddened t tauri stars ( fig .",
    "[ nircdr57 ] ) .",
    "we note that 4 of these are located in the boundary between reddened t tauri and main sequence stars , however some of their properties favour the t tauri interpretation .",
    "three of them ( gpsv9 , gpsv3 and gpsv15 ) have larger k - band excesses , which could point to the objects being class i ysos .",
    "the results of the dr7 search are similar to those of dr5 , in that most of the variables have redder ( @xmath38-@xmath15 ) colours than normal dwarf branch or giant branch stars in a 6@xmath596 arcmin field centered on the variable objects ( see fig .",
    "[ dr57cmd ] ) .",
    "there are some extreme cases : gpsv28 is extremely red and it may correspond to iras source iras 20226 + 4206 .",
    "gemini nifs spectroscopy also shows that the object has a spatially extended h@xmath11 outflow ( contreras pea et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "figure [ nircdr57 ] shows the near - infrared colours of the selected candidates .",
    "many of the objects fall in the region dominated by disc emission , i.e. between the reddened sequence of main sequence stars and the t tauri locus of @xcite .",
    "some candidates show a larger excess , which would usually suggest classification as a class i yso , i.e. a disc @xmath60 envelope system .    strong evidence to support the yso interpretation is given by the apparent high concentration of our sample towards sfrs .",
    "we performed the search for a possible association of the sources using simbad and the @xcite catalog of sfrs .",
    "the main condition for the stars to be flagged as likely associated with a sfr was that evidence of star formation would show up in a 300@xmath23 radius search , centred on the star , in simbad ( i.e. pms stars , dark clouds , hii regions ) and the @xcite catalog .",
    "four stars failed this main condition but are still flagged as likely associated with sfrs for the following reasons :    * gpsv5 and gpsv10 are within the large concentration of high amplitude variables in an area of 1 deg@xmath2 that is coincident with the serpens ob2 association ( see below ) and have colours consistent with a t tauri interpretation ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in addition",
    "gpsv5 is close to a bright 8 @xmath10 m emission feature in figure [ fig : serp ] .",
    "gpsv10 ( discussed in more detail in section [ rc : sec ] ) also shows an sed that is consistent with a yso classification .",
    "* gpsv26 is part of the sample that is within the cygnus x star forming complex ( see below ) .",
    "its near infrared colours and sed are also consistent with a yso interpretation ( see figure [ app : ysos_seds1 ] in appendix a ) .",
    "* gpsv19 is only 318@xmath23 from sfr g35.20 - 1.75 in the @xcite catalog ( see below ) .",
    "its colour is consistent with a yso classification and it is an unusually red object compared to its local @xmath61 field . the lack of mid - infrared data for the object does not allow us to confirm this interpretation through its sed .",
    "however , the spectrum of the object shows h@xmath11 emission at @xmath62 m , probably associated with a molecular outflow , and br@xmath13 emission , both of which support a yso classification ( contreras pea et al , in prep . ) .",
    "+      using our search criteria , it was found that 12 of the 17 dr5 variables present an apparent spatial association with known star forming regions .",
    "gpsv1 through 11 are located in an area of 1 deg@xmath2 that is coincident with the serpens ob2 association , a loose association of pms stars located @xmath42  kpc away @xcite and which contains several molecular clouds .",
    "the candidates do not appear to be located in the regions of most recent massive star formation that can be identified by the bright 8 @xmath10 m emission in figure [ fig : serp ] .",
    "two objects , gpsv3 and gpsv9 , are actually within the 8 @xmath10 m nebulosity and they have the reddest near - infrared colours of the serpens ob2 objects .",
    "however , they do not seem to be class i objects ( see section [ subsec : ev ] ) .",
    "the variable object gpsv16 is found to be within @xmath63 of the sfr listed as g71.52 - 0.39 @xcite in the @xcite catalog ( fig.[fig : serp ] ) .",
    "we find 17/28 dr7 variables likely associated with a known sfr .",
    "three stars ( gpsv19,gpsv21 and gpsv22 ) are likely associated with sfr g35.20 - 1.75 @xcite , gpsv42 is in sfr g26.35 + 1.83 @xcite and gpsv44 in sfr g28.96 + 3.54 @xcite .",
    "twelve of our candidates are distributed along the cygnus x star forming complex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : serp ] ) , which is known to contain several rich and complex sfrs .",
    "the presence of fuor outbursts would not be new for this region ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that 4 other stars fall in the yso region in colour - colour plots but lack a spatial association with known sfrs .",
    "these are gpsv15 , 36 , 40 and 43 .",
    "as discussed in section [ subsec : ev ] , gpsv15 displays several characteristics associated with eruptive ysos , and dr7 objects gpsv36 and 43 show seds similar to ysos ( see appendix [ app : dr7 ] ) .",
    "gpsv40 is a faint object , and very red in its local cmd .",
    "however , mid - infrared data are not available to confirm its yso nature .    in order to verify the significance of this spatial association with sfrs",
    ", we performed a monte carlo selection of many samples of 45 real gps sources in the 2 epoch area , using the same cuts as the variable star selection , except for @xmath0  mag .",
    "we find that only 10% of randomly chosen sources would be within 300@xmath23 of a known star forming region , i.e. 4 - 5 stars in our sample would be near sfrs by chance .",
    "however , as noted above , 4 stars in our sample have characteristics of ysos but are not spatially associated with known sfrs .",
    "this indicates that chance associations have little effect on the proportion of variables ( 29/45 ) that would be classified as ysos primarily on the basis of spatial association . in view of this , we believe that the strong concentration of high amplitude variables in sfrs found in our study is sufficient evidence on its own that most of the high amplitude variables are ysos .",
    "confirmation for the majority of the dr5 objects ( based on seds and spectra ) is discussed at length in section [ sec : res ] . supporting evidence for the dr7 objects , in the form of seds ,",
    "is given in appendix [ app : dr7 ] .",
    "spectra for a subset of the dr7 objects will be included in a future paper focussing mainly on the cygnus x region ( contreras pea et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "preliminary inspection indicates that most of them show emission or absorption features that support a yso classification .    despite the strong evidence that the sample is dominated by ysos",
    ", we still need to discuss other classes of high amplitude variable stars that could have the observed red colours and may account for those objects which are not in known sfrs .",
    "the faint k band magnitudes of the stars in our sample suggests that they are too faint to be r cor bor variables or luminous agb stars , such as mira - type variables . to verify this",
    ", we first derive the approximate extinction towards background objects in the local cmd of each of our sources . to do this",
    ", we noted the typical @xmath40 colour of the reddest sources in the local field ( excluding any extreme outliers ) and then calculated an estimate of the maximum extinction that they could have by assuming that they have the intrinsic colours of @xmath640.1 , corresponding to early b type stars .",
    "we then derive the distance at which a typical agb star ( assuming typical @xmath65 mag , @xmath66 mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would have to be located in order to have the apparent magnitude of the individual variable source being considered ( using the local @xmath67 estimated before ) .",
    "in each case a typical agb star would have to be located well beyond the galactic disc edge at galactocentric radius @xmath68  kpc ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that there are no typical mira variables in the sample .",
    "agb stars with high mass loss rates , such as oh / ir stars or extreme carbon stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are deeply embedded in circumstellar material and can suffer high extinction .",
    "these stars may only be observable at near - infrared wavelengths and appear fainter than typical agb stars ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore they can show up in our sample and in fact two of them are present in the dr7 sample , as discussed above .",
    "@xcite study a complete sample of nearby dust - obscured agb stars , spread over @xmath69 of the sky , that are undergoing heavy mass loss ( @xmath70yr@xmath58 ) .",
    "they find 30 stars within 1  kpc from the sun ( the completeness limit of the study ) with a scale height of 236  pc .",
    "this implies a space density of 9.35  kpc@xmath71 .",
    "most agb stars are located at @xmath7210  kpc ( ishihara et al.2011 ) . for a typical inner disc sight line at @xmath73",
    "this corresponds to a maximum heliocentric distance , @xmath74  kpc .",
    "( beyond this distance , the galactic latitudes of our survey ( @xmath75 ) would place most sources a few scale heights above the plane , so very few agb stars should be found ) .",
    "an area of 1  deg@xmath76 along this @xmath73 sightline encompasses a conical volume of 1.1  kpc@xmath77 out to d=14  kpc . after allowing for the effect of scale height on the source density",
    "this is equivalent to an effective volume of 0.12  kpc@xmath78 in the mid - plane .",
    "then , 1.12 dust - enshrouded agb stars deg@xmath79 should be contained in this volume .",
    "however , we expect to detect only a small fraction of them in a 2-epoch survey .",
    "in fact , we find that only @xmath80 should be detected , based on a monte carlo analysis using a large sample of randomly generated sinusoidal curves with different amplitudes and periods , similar to the sample of @xcite , when randomly selecting two epochs separated by 3 years .",
    "in addition , only 2/30 stars in the @xcite sample would have similar magnitudes to the brightest stars in our gps sample , if they are located at @xmath7210  kpc ( the remaining stars would almost certainly saturate in ukidss even at these large distances ) .",
    "these two stars correspond to the first and third highest mass losing agb stars in the @xcite sample ( @xmath81yr@xmath58 ) .",
    "agb stars with this extremely high mass loss rate , such as the oh / ir stars in the dr7 sample and the extreme carbon stars in @xcite , show a steep rise of their seds towards the mid - infrared , characterised by a very red @xmath82 $ ] colour , displaying @xmath82>9 $ ]  mag .    when we apply the expected detection ratio ( 0.27 ) and the fraction of agb stars with high mass loss rates that would show up in our survey ( 2/30 ) we end up with 3.1 dust - enshrouded agb stars in the area covered by our study .",
    "this number is remarkably close to our actual detection of two oh / ir stars in dr7 .",
    "only two objects from the remainder of the sample have @xmath82 $ ] colours similar to extreme agb stars ( gpsv3 and gpsv15 ) but we are confident that they are ysos rather than agb stars , see section [ sec : erup_3_15 ] . despite this , it is reasonable to expect that we will find more very red agb stars in future data releases , some of which may be previously unknown objects .",
    "symbiotic variable stars can be located in the same area as most of our variable stars in the jhk colour - colour diagram ( see figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the d - type symbiotic stars in particular have the fairly red _ ( h@xmath64k ) _ colours found among most of our sample",
    ". however , d - type symbiotic stars have agb star companions , most of which can be expected to saturate in the gps k band data ( see the earlier discussion in this section ) .",
    "@xcite note that the space density of symbiotic stars is very uncertain but it is clear that they are a small galactic population . as an illustration of their rarity , @xcite selected a large number of possible symbiotic stars based on an h@xmath55 and broad bandpass colour selection .",
    "spectroscopic follow up @xcite showed that most of their candidates were in fact t tauri stars , despite their attempt to reduce contamination by avoiding spatially clustered candidates ( symbiotic variables , like agb stars are expected to be found in isolation ) .",
    "it is unlikely therefore that there are many symbiotic stars in our sample but it is conceivable that some of the isolated objects with bluer _ ( h@xmath64k )",

    "* ) , which implies @xmath4 470 quasars in the area covered in our study",
    ". however , the fraction of high - amplitude ( @xmath19  mag ) variable agns appears to be much lower than 1@xmath1 .",
    "for example , none of the 116 quasars in the sample of @xcite displays @xmath19  mag .",
    "@xcite searched for near - infrared counterparts of agns in the ukidss large area survey ( dr6 , covering @xmath4 1850 deg@xmath2 ) and 2mass catalogues .",
    "they identified 1920 agn via @xmath15 band variability between the two epochs ( ukidss and 2mass ) , using several catalogue data quality cuts to remove most erroneous variables .",
    "their sample included 15 candidate high amplitude agns ( @xmath0  mag ) and they provided the coordinates to us at our request .",
    "only 9 of these 15 have a point source profile - classification ( @xmath84 ) in ukidss , and visual inspection reveals that only 6 of these 9 are real .",
    "the approximate completeness limit of their study only reaches to about @xmath85  mag ( although some objects are still detected at fainter magnitudes ) . to compare with our gps sample",
    ", we must first correct for the fact that the @xcite high amplitude variable sample will not include most agn that were fainter at the less sensitive 2mass epoch and then allow for our fainter magnitude limit .",
    "we find a factor of 1.6 for the first correction ( using the proportion of highly variable agn that were fainter in ukidss rather than in 2mass ) and we conservatively estimate a factor of 4 more quasars arises from our @xmath83  mag limit , using table 7 of @xcite . after applying these corrections and scaling to our survey area",
    "we find that we should expect @xmath86 high - amplitude agns in the area covered in dr7 .",
    "we note that the las covers areas of low extinction , so if we allow for the higher extinction in the galactic plane ( typically 0 to 1 mag in the @xmath15 band ) then this estimate should be considered an upper limit .",
    "when we add the results of our searches of dr5 and dr7 , we find that 29 out of 45 variables are likely associated with sfrs , thus representing @xmath466@xmath1 of our sample .",
    "as discussed above , 4 other stars show characteristics of ysos but do not seem to be associated with a known star forming region ( a discussion on this point is presented below ) .",
    "thus , the fraction of variables in sfrs could increase .    in view of the spatial bias against star formation regions in the mid - plane in this initial sample ( see section [ sec : search ] )",
    "it is clear that ysos must dominate the galactic population of high amplitude infrared variables with @xmath0  mag , at least in the magnitude range that this search has explored ( @xmath87 to 16 mag ) .",
    "the question then arises as to whether ysos dominate the total population of high amplitude infrared variables .",
    "inspection of the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that mira - type variables are the commonest type at bright magnitudes .",
    "these very luminous stars are generally saturated in the gps , except for a tiny minority with exceptionally high extinction and mass loss rate , such as the two oh / ir stars in our dr7 sample .",
    "we note that the high variability oh / ir phase is only expected to last  1700 yr @xcite , thus we do not expect to find many of these type of variables .",
    "the gcvs data indicate that 67% of miras have @xmath88  mag .",
    "( note that the @xmath15 to @xmath89 amplitude ratio has an average value of 0.2 , see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite calculated a space density of 265  kpc@xmath71 for a complete sample of agb stars within 1  kpc of the sun , with a scale height of 330  pc .",
    "@xcite performed the search for agb stars complete out to 8  kpc and they found a similar space density for sources located at galactocentric radii @xmath90  kpc , after correcting for colour - based incompleteness ( see figure 9 of that work ) .",
    "they also showed that most o - rich agb stars , which dominate the numbers at @xmath91 , are located at galactocentric radii @xmath7210  kpc .",
    "a typical inner disc sight line at @xmath73 with an area of 1  deg@xmath76 encompasses a volume of 1.11  kpc@xmath71 at @xmath7210  kpc . after allowing for the effect of scale height",
    ", the effective volume comes to 0.21  kpc@xmath71 at these distances .",
    "this volume should contain @xmath9250 agb stars deg@xmath79 .",
    "only a small fraction of agb stars are expected to be mira variables , which are at the end of the thermally pulsating phase of their evolution .",
    "@xcite give the fraction as 8% . combining this with the 67% fraction of miras with @xmath88  mag",
    "then implies a source density of @xmath922.7  deg@xmath79 for typical sight lines in quadrants 1 and 4 of the milky way .",
    "this is broadly consistent with an estimate of @xmath93 deg@xmath79 in the galactic plane obtained from inspection of the gcvs : the gcvs only includes mira variables with known periods so we expect it to provide a somewhat smaller space density .",
    "the 29 ysos imply a source density of @xmath94 = 0.19  deg@xmath79 .",
    "however , the true number is higher because : ( 1 ) with only two epochs most high amplitude variables will be missed ; ( 2 ) the source density rises towards our magnitude cut ( see fig . [ histgps ] ) , indicating that most distant , low luminosity pms variables will be undetected ; and ( 3 ) the present dataset excludes the mid - plane and is therefore strongly biased against sfrs ( see section [ sec : search ] ) .",
    "the @xcite catalogue indicates that item ( 3 ) excludes 60% of galactic sfrs ( and the true fraction is undoubtedly higher since the catalogue is incomplete for distant sfrs in the mid - plane ) .",
    "the effect of item ( 2 ) can not be reliably quantified , but it is likely to raise the source density by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "e.g. typical members of our sample with @xmath15 = 14.8 mag , @xmath27=1.4 to 2  kpc ( sources in cygnus x or serpens ob2 ) would be below our @xmath15=16 magnitude cut at @xmath95  kpc .",
    "the overwhelming majority of galactic sfrs lie at greater distances than this .",
    "the study of the spiral structure in the galaxy by @xcite is said to be complete for star forming complexes with excitation parameters , u , brighter than 60 pc cm@xmath79 .",
    "we find that 85% of these are found to be at @xmath97  kpc .",
    "also , most pms stars are less luminous than those in our sample but presumably can still have high amplitude variability , judging by the rising incidence to faint magnitudes .",
    "finally , item ( 1 ) is believed to cause approximately @xmath98 incompleteness : our analysis of high - amplitude variables arising from the 2010 - 2012 vvv data ( with at least 14 epochs of k band observations for each variable ) reveals that only @xmath4 25% of such variables would be detected when comparing the magnitudes of two epochs separated by @xmath4 2 years . adopting factors of 4 , 6.7 and 2.5 for items 1 , 2 and 3 respectively",
    ", our observed surface density of 0.19  deg@xmath79 rises to 12.7  deg@xmath79 .",
    "if we assume that 5 ysos in our sample are actually chance spatial associations of other types of variable ( see @xmath992.2 ) , and also remove the 4 stars that did not pass our 300@xmath23 criterion for sfr association but were still included , the surface density still remains high at 8.7  deg@xmath79 .",
    "this figure is of course highly uncertain , and the figure of 2.7  deg@xmath79 for miras in quadrant 1 sight lines is also quite uncertain ( by perhaps a factor of two given that the space density of agb stars has a @xmath450% uncertainty in ishihara et al.(2011 ) and the error on the 8% fraction of agb stars that are mira variables is not clear in the literature ) .",
    "nonetheless , we conclude that pms high amplitude infrared variables are likely to be the commonest type of high amplitude infrared variable in most parts of the milky way , except in the bulge where agb stars have higher densities .",
    "the true incidence will no doubt be established more precisely in the near future using data from vvv @xcite .",
    "optical surveys have been used effectively to identify low mass pms stars even in regions where molecular gas , a common tracer for sfrs , has dissipated @xcite .",
    "although the near - ir variability of such objects has been less thoroughly studied , previous surveys show that the majority of ysos are variable at these wavelengths due to different physical processes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , peak to peak amplitudes have been found to be low , with a mean of 0.17 mag in the work of e.g. @xcite . only a small fraction show larger amplitudes , e.g. only @xmath100 of stars with discs show @xmath101 mag in the sample of @xcite .",
    "the fraction seems remarkably higher ( @xmath102 ) in the recent time series study of class i protostars @xcite ( see section [ sec : intro ] ) which suggests that infrared variability surveys can most easily pick out the parts of molecular clouds where star formation has occurred very recently .",
    "@xcite also shows that the fraction of high - amplitude variables increases with extending time baselines .",
    "it is possible then that high - amplitude variability in the infrared , studied over a long baseline such as the one in gps , can also effectively trace low mass pms stars and thus evidence of star formation .",
    "this could be supported by the finding of the four objects with yso colours and not associated with known sfrs .",
    "only marginal and inconclusive evidence for any association to star formation could be found for three of these sources .",
    "the projected location of gpsv15 is at the edge of the dark cloud ldn 667 @xcite , gpsv36 is within 2 arcmin of reflection nebula gn 18.08.8 @xcite and gpsv43 is located in a highly reddened field near the edge of the w40 hii region @xcite . a search for low - amplitude near - infrared variability in the gps near these sources does not reveal the presence of a pms association , however a more statistically thorough study is necessary to firmly discard the presence of such an association .",
    "the high variability of the candidates , along with the observed colours and the possible association with sfrs for many of them , makes the stars strong candidates for eruptive variable classification .",
    "this study will focus on the analysis of the eruptive variable candidates arising from dr5 of gps ; the analysis of dr7 objects will be presented on a later paper ( contreras pea et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",

    "flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , tilt correction and extraction of the spectrum for each object and the corresponding f - type calibrator were performed with the usual tasks in the noao / twodspec package in iraf .",
    "finally , the calibrator spectrum was divided by a blackbody curve of similar temperature to that of the star and used to correct the target spectrum .",
    "photometric observations for each target consisted of 12 images in @xmath110 , @xmath39 and @xmath53 with typical exposure times of 5 s. each image was observed in a different position within a 15@xmath23 wide jitter box .",

    "the latter consisted of @xmath4 10 - 15 images in filters @xmath110 and @xmath39 with exposure times of @xmath35 s. @xmath53 images were not taken for this project so suitable images were acquired from the eso archive , taking care to select images that were observed with the same instrumental setup , exposure times and a similar observing date .",
    "source magnitudes were obtained through aperture photometry , performed on final sky - subtracted images , using apphot in iraf .",
    "the calibration of the final magnitudes was obtained with the process described below .",
    "firstly , a set of 180 local standards from the iraf aperture photometry results were selected , corresponding to bright stars , with low photometric errors , no processing errors and with no close companions .",
    "cross - match with",
    "the ukidss gps catalog of the same area covered by isaac , yielded typically @xmath4 60 - 100 matches .    by taking the average ( after removal of outlying sources ) of @xmath111",
    ", we obtain the offset that will be applied to the isaac instrumental magnitudes .",
    "this process is sufficiently accurate for both @xmath110 and @xmath39 , given the similar @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the ukidss and isaac filters , however , @xmath114 differs from @xmath115 , being similar to 2mass @xmath116 filter profile .    to study the differences between ukidss and 2mass @xmath15 , we cross - matched our local standards with the 2mass catalog for the same area , finding around 20 - 40 stars .",
    "the differences between ukidss and 2mass are plotted in fig .",
    "[ uk2 m ] , here it can be seen that magnitudes are similar in both systems , especially for brighter sources .",
    "thus the selection of either system for the calibration would not have a severe effect on the calibrated magnitudes .",
    "this was found to be true for each of our objects . given the greater number of ukidss stars found , and the greater precision of ukidss magnitudes for the fainter stars , we decide to use ukidss photometry for the @xmath53 calibration .",
    "a magnitude correction , however , needs to be applied for our sample , especially the case of the reddest stars where most of its flux falls in the @xmath15-band .",
    "using the reduced spectrum of the object , a correction factor was derived by comparing the ratio of the total flux of the star in ukidss and isaac @xmath15 filters , to the same ratio for a blackbody spectrum at t = 9700  k ( which is appropriate for these vega - based magnitudes ) .",
    "the correction factor is then given by    @xmath117    this correction was largest for the reddest stars in our sample but never exceeded 0.05 mag .      follow up of the two reddest objects in the dr5 sample , gpsv3 and gpsv15 , was performed on may 8th , 2012 with the fire spectrograph mounted on the magellan baade telescope at las campanas observatory , chile .",
    "the observations were carried out in the high - throughput prism mode which provides a continuous coverage from @xmath118 at low resolution of @xmath119 with a 0.6@xmath23 slit .",
    "the objects were observed in the usual abba pattern along the slit , with individual exposures of 148 s and at airmasses of 1.1 and 1.4 for gpsv3 and gpsv15 respectively .",
    "observations of spectroscopic calibrators were carried out for purposes of telluric correction and flux calibration ; the calibrators were observed at similar airmass as the objects and with the same instrumental setup .",
    "quartz lamp images were obtained for flat fielding of the data , they consisted of high - voltage ( 2.2v ) images that provide data for the z / j bands but saturate the red end of the spectrum , and low - voltage(1.1v ) that generate counts in h / k but are too faint for the blue end .",
    "additionally , nenear arc lamp images were acquired for wavelength calibration .",
    "the images were reduced using the longslit package of the firehose software . using the nenear lamp image",
    ", firehose generates an arc solution , which had typical uncertainties of 0.4 pixels or @xmath4 2.7 @xmath120 .",
    "the second step consisted of creating a flat image ; this is done by combining the 2.2v ( blue ) and 1.1v ( red ) with a smooth weighting function spread over @xmath4 150 pixels centered on a transition pixel defined by the user . finally the software traces and extracts the spectrum of the object .",
    "telluric correction and flux calibration were performed in the standard mode using noao / twodspec package in iraf , in a similar process to that described in section [ isaac : dr ] .    unfortunately , the selected exposure times saturated part of the k - band data of both objects , more noticeably in gpsv15 .",
    "however , the data still provide useful information for our analysis , particularly at the shorter wavelengths not covered by the isaac or nifs spectra .",
    "additional k - band spectroscopic data of four variables , namely gpsv3 , gpsv8 , gpsv15 and gpsv16 , were acquired in august 2012 using the near - infrared integral field spectrometer ( nifs ) of gemini north telescope , mauna kea , hawaii .",

    "the weakness of the bandheads , relative to the lower j transitions , indicates that we are observing gas that is somewhat cooler than is typical of m - type stellar atmospheres , so that only the lower energy levels are populated .",

    "we removed the slope of the higher resolution spectra by fitting a straight line to the 2.18 - 2.28 @xmath10 m region and extrapolating towards the co region .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ nifs_co ] . in gpsv15",
    "we see numerous features rising above the normalised continuum level in between the co absorption lines . this could be due to emission from the rapidly rotating hot portion of the inner disc , which would show as the wings of rotationally broadened emission lines in between the stronger but narrower absorption lines .",
    "rotation velocities would be of the order of 200 km / s within a few stellar radii of a low mass yso , which is slightly higher than the nifs velocity resolution of 60 km / s . since features in excess of the continuum are not observed in between every pair of adjacent co absorption lines we can not be certain of this interpretation .",
    "however , the wavelengths where we see no excess above the continuum are mostly located close to one of the higher order bandheads ( 3 - 1 , 4 - 2 and 5 - 3 ) where the close proximity of numerous co absorption lines disfavours observation of weak rotationally broadened emission features , at this spectral resolution .",
    "observations at higher spectral resolution are therefore desirable in order to resolve the profile of rotationally broadened lines from the disc and verify their existence .",
    "the presence of any such features in gpsv3 is marginal and strongly dependent on the choice of wavelengths used for the removal of the slope of the continuum .",
    "however , several emission lines are observed in the high resolution spectrum of gpsv3 ( see fig .",

    "the observed ( 50 km s@xmath58 ) blueshifted absorption was interpreted by @xcite as arising from an ejected dense and low temperature shell ( t@xmath4  620 k ) .",
    "we note that the 40 km s@xmath58 blueshift seen in gpsv15 is too small to significantly affect our discussion concerning the presence of rotationally broadened emission features in between the absorption features .    in summary , the observed co structure of gpsv15",
    "could be explained by an emission component from an inner disc , combined with absorption by a cooler gas arising in an ejected shell .",
    "it is also conceivable that cooler parts of the disc at larger radii are contributing to the absorption ( which could also be the case in gpsv3 ) .",
    "however , the presence of both emission and absorption components in an individual object is more readily understood in terms of two separate structures .",
    "the seds of gpsv3 and gpsv15 are exceptionally red in the 1 to 5@xmath179 m region , with @xmath38-w2@xmath911  mag .",
    "this is consistent with a class i yso classification but at longer wavelengths their seds become roughly flat ( from @xmath45 - 12  @xmath10 m ) and then decline towards 23  @xmath10 m , as measured by _",
    "akari _ and wise .",
    "the sed flattening and lack of cold dust emission is consistent with an accretion disc .",
    "we find that for gpsv15 , only a relatively small number of models could be used to estimate the values of the parameters in table [ table : sedfits ] . in addition",
    "the @xmath180 per data point for the best - fitting model of gpsv3 was found to be larger than the derived values for the remaining objects .",
