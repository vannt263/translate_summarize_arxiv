    "according to classical electrodynamics an accelerated charge emits radiation .",
    "if the acceleration is due to an incident laser field this process of emission may be called inelastic scattering of the incident laser field by the charge ( e.g. , an electron ) . this process has been thoroughly investigated and is called either thomson scattering if quantum effects are negligible @xcite or compton scattering if quantum effects are important @xcite .    throughout all of the cited works the incident laser field is taken as a plane - wave field with a peak electric field @xmath0 and carrier angular frequency @xmath1 , and its intensity is characterized by the relativistically invariant parameter @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the electron s charge , @xmath4 is its mass , and @xmath5 is the speed of light .",
    "a pulse in this work is indicated as _ intense _ , if the parameter @xmath6 is much larger than unity .",
    "an electron in such an intense laser field is accelerated to relativistic velocities already in one laser period @xcite .",
    "the electric field strengths needed to attain a parameter @xmath6 equal to unity for optical radiation and for x - rays would be @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath9 is the usual planck constant .",
    "these field strengths correspond to laser intensities of @xmath10 in the optical regime ( @xmath11 ev ) , laser intensities of these orders have already been obtained during the last decade @xcite . among others ,",
    "these laser systems have been employed to find extensive experimental proof of nonlinear thomson scattering @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "laser systems were employed , reaching nonlinearity parameters ( this choice of language is explained below ) of the order of up to @xmath12 . due to lack of sufficiently intense laser systems so far , nonlinear compton scattering in a laser field has been verified in only one experimental setup @xcite , but with the development of laser systems to ever higher peak intensities , more experimental tests for nonlinear compton scattering seem to be in reach .",
    "the record optical intensity of @xmath13 , obtained in 2008 , corresponds to a parameter @xmath6 of the order of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is often referred to as the nonlinearity parameter @xcite .",
    "in fact , for @xmath15 , the interaction of an electron with the laser is no longer linearly dependent on the laser intensity .",
    "this can be understood classically by observing that at electron velocities inside the laser field close to @xmath5 , the magnetic force on the electron is of comparable strength as the electric force , and the total interaction is no longer linear in the external field because the velocity also depends on the field .",
    "another physical interpretation for the nonlinear dependence of the scattering rates on the laser intensity can be given in the photon picture of the laser field .",
    "in fact , the intensity of a radiation field is connected to the photon number density .",
    "for a not too intense laser field , an electron will basically always scatter only one photon from it . on the other hand ,",
    "if the incident radiation is very intense , that is , its photon flux is very high , the electron likely interacts with many photons from the laser field . thus the scattering rate will no longer depend linearly on the laser intensity but will exhibit a more complex dependency . in this picture",
    ", the parameter @xmath6 gives the ratio of energy absorbed by the electron @xmath16 in one compton wavelength @xmath17 in units of the incident laser photon energy @xmath18 . in this sense , if @xmath19 , the electron on average absorbs more than one photon from the laser field during the process , which again yields nonlinear effects .",
    "so in this work , the terms _ multiphoton _ and _ nonlinear _ compton scattering are used interchangeably .",
    "the photon flux in state - of - the - art laser facilities may now become so high that the electron absorbs a large number of photons , resulting in the emission of a single high - energetic photon .",
    "if the energy of this photon is of the order of the electron s energy , then the recoil effect on the electron motion has to be taken into account .",
    "this is an intrinsically quantum effect .",
    "the strength of nonlinear quantum effects is described by the dimensionless parameter @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the electron s initial four - momentum , where @xmath22 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor [ @xmath23 is the laser photon four - momentum and @xmath24 is the laser four - potential strength , with @xmath25 and the metric @xmath26 is used in this article .",
    "it is always possible to consider the scattering of an electron by a plane wave in a reference frame in which the electron and the laser field are initially counterpropagating , and in that frame the expression of @xmath27 simplifies to @xmath28 where for two four - vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 we introduced the notation @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the critical field of qed .",
    "this allows the interpretation of @xmath27 as the laser s electric field amplitude evaluated in the reference frame in which the electron initially is at rest , in units of @xmath33 .",
    "the critical field transfers an energy @xmath34 to an electron over one electron compton wavelength . creating an electric field of that amplitude would demand a laser intensity of @xmath35 all laser fields available today fall short of reaching the critical field strength by at least 3 or 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "the physical relevance of this quantity is that in a constant and uniform electric field of the critical field strength , the probability of creating electron - positron pairs from a vacuum becomes non negligible @xcite .",
    "so if the parameter @xmath27 approaches unity , the electron will feel an electric field strength at which there are nonlinear qed effects expected to happen .",
    "it has been pointed out that for small intensity parameters @xmath36 , quantum effects scale with the laser photon energy ( in the initial rest frame of the electron ) , that is , with the parameter @xmath37 while for the opposite case @xmath38 , they scale with the parameter @xmath27 , that is , rather with the electric field strength @xcite . so in the case @xmath38 , which we put particular emphasis on , we expect for @xmath39 , quantum effects to become important .",
    "most of the theoretical works done so far on nonlinear compton scattering considered a monochromatic laser wave @xcite .",
    "in fact , there has been some work on electron scattering from a laser pulse of duration @xmath40 and frequency @xmath1 @xcite , but there the authors considered a pulse fulfilling the condition @xmath41 that is , a pulse containing many cycles of the carrier field .",
    "however , in order to generate high laser peak intensities and correspondingly high @xmath6 parameters , laser pulses are compressed spatially as well as temporally .",
    "spatial compression is usually neglected in theoretical works , assuming to deal with laser beams which are not tightly focused and which can be safely approximated by a plane wave .",
    "this is also the case of the present article .",
    "concerning temporal compression , there have been works on nonlinear compton scattering not relying on the condition ( [ longpulsecond ] ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting structure of the general scattering matrix element obtained by the authors agrees with the one found in this article . on the other hand , in @xcite ,",
    "the authors perform a more exploratory analysis of the scattering process in the regime @xmath42 , while in this article we present a detailed analytical analysis of high - intensity ( @xmath43 ) nonlinear compton scattering . in this work , next to the analytical part",
    ", particular emphasis is put on the effect on the spectra of varying the laser intensity and the incident electron energy .",
    "also , in @xcite , the authors consider effects of the absolute phase [ the so - called carrier envelope phase ( cep ) ] of few - cycle pulses and its impact on the emitted photon energy spectra . here",
    "we also consider the effect of cep on the angular distribution of the emitted radiation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "laser pulses lasting only one or two cycles , as investigated in the present work , have become available in different frequency ranges such as in the mid - infrared @xcite , in the near - infrared @xcite , in the optical @xcite , and in the extreme ultraviolet regimes @xcite .",
    "moreover , we point out that all high - field laser facilities operating or under construction employ short pulse durations to generate high field strengths .",
    "for instance , the petawatt field synthesizer ( pfs ) laser system under construction in garching ( germany ) aims at optical laser intensities of the order of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) by compressing an energy of @xmath46 to only @xmath47 , corresponding to less than two laser cycles @xcite . at the extreme light infrastructure @xcite and at the high power laser energy research @xcite facilities , which aim at unprecedented laser intensities of the order of @xmath48 , pulse durations of about @xmath49",
    "are envisaged .",
    "this shows the close linking between the generation of large values of @xmath6 and short pulse durations . additionally ,",
    "since all high - field facilities referenced here operate at optical wavelengths , we will also focus on the energy regime @xmath50 ev for the incident laser .",
    "put in quantitative terms , short pulses containing one or only a few cycles of the electric field will be distinguished by the condition @xmath51 in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ longpulsecond ] ) . for optical lasers",
    ", this corresponds to pulse durations on the order of @xmath52 fs .",
    "we will label laser pulses fulfilling the condition ( [ shortpulsecond ] ) as ultrashort .",
    "as it will turn out later , the connection between few - cycle pulses and nonlinear compton scattering is twofold .",
    "not only does one have to incorporate eq .",
    "( [ shortpulsecond ] ) into the framework of compton scattering , but also , nonlinear compton scattering offers a thorough way of determining the precise temporal shape of few - cycle laser pulses @xcite .    the main purpose of this article , however , is to investigate nonlinear compton scattering in ultrashort pulses in the framework of strong - field qed . a visualization of the scattering process we are going to consider in the language of feynman diagrams looks like as shown on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ feyngraph ] .",
    "the electron enters the laser field with an incoming four - momentum @xmath53 . during the interaction with the laser pulse ,",
    "it may absorb or reemit @xmath54 photons from or into the laser s photon field , all sharing the same wave vector @xmath23 , and at some point , the electron emits a single final photon with wave vector @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "[ feyngraph ] , @xmath54 may be an arbitrarily large natural number ( the case @xmath56 is absent because energy - momentum conservation can not be fulfilled ) , what we represent by the dots inserted into the electron line . after the scattering , the electron will propagate with a changed four - momentum which , after exiting the laser field , is given by @xmath57 . in order to take into account exactly the ultra strong laser field , which can not be treated perturbatively",
    ", one would have to sum over all @xmath54 in the process depicted on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ feyngraph ] . instead of doing so , we perform the calculations in the furry picture of quantum dynamics , intrinsically taking the external field into account exactly . here",
    "the electron states employed for computing the process amplitude are obtained by solving the dirac equation in the plane - wave field .",
    "the resulting states are known as volkov states , and they are indicated as a double solid line in the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ feyngraph ] .",
    "we will restrict to values of the parameter @xmath27 smaller or of the order of 1 .",

    "we choose the parameter set @xmath314 and @xmath342 , corresponding to a quantum parameter @xmath343 . the resulting spectrum is shown in fig .  [ asymp_spec_chi=4 ] .     and @xmath325 for the emission angle @xmath328 . ]    as for the case of the sine - shaped pulse , we observe in this spectrum the typical quantum pile - up of the radiation toward @xmath263 .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction there has already been a lot of work on thomson and compton scattering from monochromatic @xcite or long - pulsed @xcite lasers fields . in the present article",
    "we have considered the opposite situation in which the pulse contains only one or a few cycles .",
    "comparing our results to previous work , we find some agreement as well as some differences . we obtain analogous qualitative behavior in our emission spectra concerning the rise of nonlinear quantum effects in the scattering process .",
    "specifically we could show that in the regime @xmath38 , the parameter @xmath27 also in the case of ultrashort laser pulses is suitable to characterize the onset of quantum effects .",
    "however , we could unveil two major differences between these earlier treatments and our analysis .",
    "first of all , we found the momentum conserving @xmath114 functions contained in the transition matrix element to differ from those obtained for scattering off monochromatic laser waves or long pulses .",
    "we interpreted this as the absence of a dressed mass effect in particular for ultrashort pulses containing only one laser cycle .",
    "additionally we pointed out that this prediction could be tested by not only detecting the photons emitted in the scattering process but also the scattered electrons .",
    "then , by measuring the momenta of the outgoing particles , one could judge if the electron propagated with a dressed mass inside the pulse or not .",
    "second , we found a different structure of the energy emission spectra . even though the multiphoton peaks are still present , they are significantly broadened with respect to the case of a monochromatic laser beam .",
    "this can be understood such that for ultrashort durations a laser pulse can no longer be viewed to be composed of many photons with the same energy .",
    "these two features are the effects we find to be expected when considering ultrashort pulses in an electron - laser scattering event .",
    "moreover we have shown analytically that , when classical electrodynamics apply , a classical interference picture and a quantum mechanical multiphoton description both consistently describe the position of the minima and maxima in the emission spectra .",
    "finally , by means of a careful application of the saddle - point method , we have been able to calculate analytically the spectra at large values of @xmath6 also for ultrashort laser pulses .",
