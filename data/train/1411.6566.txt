    "generating coherences from incoherent sources has been discussed extensively in literature @xcite .",
    "it has been established that one can generate transient coherences even from incoherent sources @xcite .",
    "various investigations of incoherent pumping in three level atoms @xcite has already been done .",
    "these reports have shown that it is indeed possible to use an incoherent field to induce transient coherent dynamics between states . using this transient coherence , they have demonstrated the ability to do lasing without inversion @xcite , quenching of spontaneous emission @xcite , all coherent phenomena induced by incoherent pumps .",
    "the long time result of interaction of matter with incoherent light has been investigated and is found to be a mixed state @xcite .",
    "however the problem with using white noise is its coherence properties .",
    "firstly , white noise is not realizable in the laboratory and is a mathematical concept rather than a physical one .",
    "second , it is very difficult to compute the first order coherence function .",
    "however , these approaches ( @xcite ) are not truly incoherent in the sense that they use the same field to induce transitions from a common ground state @xmath2 to excited states @xmath3 and @xmath4 as well as the fact that they use white noise , a source with a poorly defined first order coherence function @xmath5 .    here",
    "we demonstrate how , when the correlation the field shares with itself and the atom at a time @xmath6 is removed , white noise can not generate coherences between excited states in a @xmath0 configuration .",
    "instead , we advocate the use of a collisionally broadened cw source @xcite .",
    "this is given by the two time correlation function :    @xmath7    in this model , @xmath8 represents the frequency center of the radiation , and @xmath9 represents the field intensity or electric field strength .",
    "the coherence time of this radiation is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath13 is temperature @xcite .",
    "the first order coherence function for a collisionally broadened cw source is much easier to compute @xcite than that of white noise .",
    "it is expressed as a function of the difference between the two times @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15    from eq .",
    "[ g1wien ] it is evident that the source is completely coherent for @xmath16 .",
    "this coherence eventually exponentially decays as a function of @xmath17 scaled by a characteristic radiation coherence time , @xmath1 .",
    "this is a much more realistic noisy source than white light .",
    "the first order coherence function has a finite level of coherence at @xmath16 , as opposed to white noise which does not .",
    "in fact , at @xmath16 , the first order correlation function of white noise has a singularity .    in this paper",
    "we use a collisionally broadened cw source , each tuned to the transition between the ground and excited states in a closed but not degenerate @xmath0 configuration .",
    "these two noisy lasers are also forced to be uncorrelated with each other .",
    "we demonstrate that the two excited states demonstrate a transient coherence associated with this noisy electric field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii discusses the excitation of a @xmath0 system with two uncorrelated white noise sources , section iii discusses the irradiation of a @xmath0 level system with two uncorrelated collisionally broadened cw sources and the paper is concluded in section iv .",
    "an example of incoherent pumping is a closed @xmath0 level atom irradiated by two white noise electric fields similar to the approach of @xcite .",
    "it is described by the hamiltonian outlined in eq .",
    "( 3 ) . here",
    "we make the rotating wave ( rwa ) and electric dipole approximation ( eda ) .",

    "@xmath20 is the dipole moment of the @xmath18 transition and @xmath21 is the dipole moment of the @xmath19 transition . in the interaction picture ,",
    "the hamiltonian is of the form :    @xmath22     system . in the long time limit",

    "$ ] of the @xmath0 system . from the plot of the purity ,",
    "it is clear that the state quickly becomes a mixed state with the purity reaching values of @xmath23 quickly .",
    "pump power to both levels was set to @xmath24 thz . ]    here we define : @xmath25 .",
    "the white noise statistics of the electric fields are given by :    @xmath26    the laser power is represented by the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "we acquire a solution by formally integrating eq .",
    "( 5 ) : @xmath28-\\frac{1}{\\hbar^{2}}\\int dt'\\left[\\mathcal{h}_{i}(t),\\left[\\mathcal{h}_{i}(t'),\\rho(t')\\right]\\right]\\ ] ]    after formal integration and ensemble averaging over the field .",
    "this leads to the following equation of motions for the populations of the states ( in the schroedinger picture ) :    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    the equation of motion of the coherences between the two excited states is given by :    @xmath32    we numerically solve the above equations for an initial condition of @xmath33 .",
    "these results are presented in fig [ whitenoiseres ] . from these calculations",
    ", it is apparent that it is not possible to generate coherences from these two uncorrelated white noise lasers .",
    "in fact , in the steady state all the populations equilibrate , i.e. @xmath34",
    ". purity of the system as well as excited state coherence fraction , @xmath35 is also plotted and presented in fig [ whitenoiseres2 ] .",
    "this scenario leads to the creation of a mixed state without ever generating coherences between the excited states .",
    "this is due to the kronecker delta in the correlation function of the white noise ( eq ( [ whitenoisecorr ] ) ) .",
    "the kronecker delta ensures that the two fields inducing the transitions to the upper levels are not correlated with each other at any time . in literature schemes",
    "@xcite , this condition is not enforced . as a result ,",
    "the field is always correlated with itself in time . by eliminating this self correlation",
    ", one eliminates all transient coherence that might appear because of it .",
    "removing this correlation is important as the @xmath5 of white noise encounters a singularity at @xmath16 and it is this singularity that drives the atom to produce coherences between the excited states .",
    "our approach should be contrasted to the work of ref @xcite which utilizes this initial self correlation to induce coherences between radiation uncoupled states in both the @xmath36 and @xmath0 architectures .",

    "these responses are then collected and ensemble averaged to produce @xmath52 . to ensure the lack of correlation between the two fields we use different random seeds for important parameters such as phase change and phase change time .",

    "the incident field strength was set to @xmath58 thz for all calculations unless otherwise specified .",
    "this value of the rabi frequency was chosen for numerical convenience .",
    "our main results , encapsulated in the measure @xmath41 , are independent of the rabi frequency we choose .",
    "we can see that even though there is no initial self correlation , it is still possible to have a transient coherent response for various excited state splittings using collisionally broadened cw laser excitation .",
    "the coherences seen in figs [ wienerres],[wienerres2 ] are due to the partial coherence of the field for finite times , as demonstrated in eq .",
    "[ g1wien ] .",
    "an interesting trend develops : the larger the excited state splitting relative to the radiation coherence time , @xmath1 , the more rapid the decay to a mixed state .",
    "this can be observed in the purity of the total state as a function of time , as well as the rapid deterioration of excited state coherence fraction .",
    "however , as the excited states splitting becomes smaller relative to the radiation coherence time , @xmath1 , the excited state coherences become a larger fraction of excited state population , manifested in the measure @xmath41 . as @xmath1",
    "is increased then naturally the response becomes more coherent .    the purity of the total state decreases as a function of time .",
    "however , the rate of this decrease becomes smaller as @xmath1 increases , i.e. the more coherent the field the smaller the decoherence experienced by the system .",
    "purity also decreases at a smaller rate for systems with small excited state splitting .",
    "for the cases studied , regardless of the excited state splitting , the excited state populations equilibrate to @xmath23 , similar to the case of excitation by uncorrelated white light sources , this is demonstrated in figs [ cohpop60],[cohpop120 ] .",
    "however , the amplitude of the excited state coherences increases as excited state splitting becomes smaller , as seen in figs [ cohpop601],[cohpop1201 ] . from previous investigations of excitation by partially coherent light @xcite , it was shown that as the excited state splitting becomes smaller relative to radiation coherence time @xmath1 , the coherences become a larger fraction of the excited state population .",
    "this is due to the coherences being inversely proportional to the level spacing @xmath59 as demonstrated in ref @xcite .",
    "a more in depth discussion of the issue is found there .",
    "the constraint of the uncorrelated fields forces the populations to equilibrate to a steady value as the coherences become larger .",
    "hence the coherence fraction , @xmath41 , for small excited state splitting is large .",
    "the purity of the system , @xmath57 $ ] is affected by the populations of the levels @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath44 as well as the excited state coherences @xmath62 and the ground to excited state correlations . in all the cases that were studied , the populations of the states approach the same value .",
    "the differentiating factor is the excited state coherences and the ground to excited state correlations .",
    "the amplitude of the excited state coherences also increases as the excited state period becomes larger , thus purity decreases at a slower rate for large excite state periods relative to the radiation coherence time , @xmath1 .    for small splittings , and thus large excited state periods ,",
    "the excited state subspace remains unusually coherent .",
    "this offers an interesting application to quantum optics which requires coherence for phenomena such as eit or lasing @xcite .",
    "this degree of excited state coherence can remain coherent for a long time ( approx . @xmath63",
    "fs ) for certain cases .",
    "in this paper we examined excitation of a @xmath0 level system by two uncorrelated white noise and collisionally broadened cw sources . for the case of white noise excitation",
    ", we have demonstrated that it is _ not _ possible to generate even a transient coherent system response .",
    "we have also shown that a @xmath0 level system excited using two uncorrelated collisionally broadened cw sources allows for the creation of a transient coherent response .",
    "we attribute the transient coherence of the material system to the transient coherence of the field @xcite . as one alters the excited state splitting , the nature of the coherent response changes . for small excited state periods ( relative to the radiation coherence time @xmath1 )",
    "the coherences become a small fraction of the excited state population .",
    "however , for large excited state periods ( relative to the radiation coherence time @xmath1 ) , an unusually coherent excited state subspace persists where the coherences of the excited remain large relative to the sum of the excited state populations .",
    "we must emphasize that not only is the aforementioned scenario physically realizable in the laboratory but also generates coherences between excited states using the partial coherence of the field .",
    "our result should be contrasted with literature models such as @xcite , which generate coherences from white noise , a source with ill defined coherence properties .",
    "these sources exploit a correlation between the field and the system at some initial time @xmath6 to generate coherences between the excited states .",
