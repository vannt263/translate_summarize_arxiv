    "the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics implies that the final state of a particle that moves slowly along a closed path is identical to the initial eigenstate  up to a phase factor . the berry phase is a time - independent contribution to this phase , depending only on the geometry of the path.@xcite a simple example is a spin-@xmath0 in a rotating magnetic field @xmath1 , where the berry phase equals half the solid angle swept by @xmath1 .",

    "<S> an electron spin moving adiabatically in a strong , spatially non - uniform magnetic field accumulates a geometric phase or berry phase , which might be observable as a conductance oscillation in a mesoscopic ring . </S>",
    "<S> two contradicting theories exist for how strong the magnetic field should be to ensure adiabaticity if the motion is diffusive . to resolve this controversy </S>",
    "<S> , we study the effect of a non - uniform magnetic field on the spin polarization and on the weak - localization effect . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion equation for the cooperon is solved exactly . </S>",
    "<S> adiabaticity requires that the spin - precession time is short compared to the elastic scattering time  it is not sufficient that it is short compared to the diffusion time around the ring . </S>",
    "<S> this strong condition severely complicates the experimental observation . </S>"
