    "in a broader context , it provides a useful test of theories that seek to modify gravity in order to obviate the need for dark matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these should make specific and testable predictions for the tully - fisher relation .",
    "the tully - fisher relation was originally posed as an empirical relation between optical luminosity and the width of the 21 cm line .",
    "these are presumably proxies for more physical quantities .",
    "the 21 cm line - width is a proxy for rotation velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which is widely presumed to be set by the dark matter halo .",
    "luminosity is a proxy for stellar mass , which is presumably related to the total mass of the system .",
    "thus a relation like tully - fisher seems natural , with the mass of the parent halo specifying both luminosity and rotation velocity .",
    "luminosity is not a perfect proxy for mass .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio can , and presumably does , vary with galaxy type .",
    "this leads to tully - fisher relations with different slopes and scatter depending on the band - pass used to measure the luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , low luminosity galaxies tend to fall below the extrapolation of the fit to bright galaxies @xcite . yet all these observed relations presumably stem from a single underlying physical relation .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that baryonic mass is a more fundamental quantity than luminosity . for",
    "any given stellar population , different mass - to - light ratios will be produced in different bands by the same mass of stars .",
    "more importantly , physics should not distinguish between mass in stars and mass in other forms . adding the observed gas mass to the stellar mass results in a baryonic tully - fisher relation ( btfr ) that is linear ( in log space ) over many decades in mass @xcite .",
    "the btfr appears to be the fundamental physical relation underpinning the empirical tully - fisher relation . as such ,",
    "the true form of the btfr is of obvious importance .    in this paper ,",
    "i calibrate the btfr with gas rich galaxies .",
    "the masses of gas rich galaxies can be more accurately measured than those of the star dominated galaxies that traditionally define the tully - fisher relation because they are less affected by the systematic uncertainty in the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xcite .",
    "this results in a purely empirical calibration with a minimum of assumptions .    in  2 ,",
    "i discuss the data required construct the btfr , assemble samples of gas rich galaxies , explore the statistics of the data , and calibrate the relation . in ",
    "3 i examine the implications of the relation for @xmath0cdm  and mond .",
    "i define a feedback efficacy parameter @xmath4 to quantify the mapping between observations and theoretical dark halo parameters .",
    "i estimate the value of the mond acceleration constant @xmath5 from the empirical btfr",
    ". a summary of the conclusions are given in  4 .",
    "in order to construct the btfr , it is necessary to estimate the baryonic mass of a galaxy on the one hand , and its rotation velocity on the other .",
    "the baryonic mass is the sum of all observed components , stars and gas : @xmath6 combining this with measurements of the rotation velocity , one obtains the btfr : @xmath7 remarkably , this simple formula suffices to describe the data for rotating galaxies .",
    "there is no indication of any need for a third parameter such as radius or surface brightness @xcite : the tully - fisher relation is the optimal projection of the fundamental plane of disk galaxies .",
    "the stellar mass of a galaxy is determined from its measured luminosity and an estimate of its stellar - mass - light ratio @xmath8 : @xmath9 the mass - to - light ratio is commonly obtained from stellar population models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these predict correlations between @xmath8  and color so that the observed color is used to estimate @xmath8 .",
    "the use of a stellar mass - to - light ratio estimated from stellar population models causes a significant systematic uncertainty in the stellar mass @xcite , which is particularly sensitive to the imf .",
    "depending on the choice of model , one can derive btfrs with slopes anywhere in the range of @xmath10 to 4 @xcite .",
    "this is a basic limitation that is hard to avoid in samples of spiral galaxies where most of the baryonic mass is in the form of stars .",
    "this can be overcome by use of samples of galaxies whose baryonic mass is dominated by gas rather than stars @xcite . in such gas",
    "rich galaxies , the uncertainty in stellar mass is reduced to a minor contributor to the total error budget .",
    "nevertheless , i am careful to employ a self - consistent population model to all galaxies employed in the analysis ( table  [ datatable ] ) .",
    "galaxies with @xmath11 can be found among very late type ( sd and sm ) spirals and irregulars with rotation velocities @xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with enough such galaxies ,",
    "it is possible to obtain an absolute calibration of the btfr that is effectively independent of the stellar mass estimator @xcite . here",
    "i describe gas mass estimates for galaxies used in the analysis .",
    "neutral atomic ( hi ) gas usually dominates the gas component of disk galaxies .",
    "the mass of hi follows directly from the physics of the spin - flip transition of hydrogen , the cosmic hydrogen fraction , and the distance to each galaxy .",
    "there is no uncertain mass - to - light ratio as with stars .",
    "the gas mass is estimated by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the observed atomic gas mass .",
    "the factor @xmath15 accounts for the cosmic hydrogen fraction and forms of gas other than hi . since the majority of objects of interest here are low luminosity late type galaxies , a primordial hydrogen fraction is assumed ( @xmath16 ) rather than the commonly assumed solar value ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this difference is less than the typical uncertainty in @xmath14 , but does make the numbers here differ slightly from those in the source data .",
    "after atomic hydrogen , molecular gas is the next significant gas component .",
    "molecular gas persists in being difficult to detect in late type , low surface brightness galaxies . where detected , it appears to contain relatively little of the interstellar gas mass @xcite .",
    "such direct measurements of molecular gas are not available for most galaxies . to estimate the molecular gas mass",
    ", we might resort to scaling relations for @xmath18 such that @xmath19 @xcite showed that @xmath18 depends on morphological type , albeit with large scatter . from their data , @xcite derived the scaling relation @xmath20 .",
    "the vast majority of of gas rich galaxies are very late types ( @xmath21 ) , so the typical correction is small ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we can use the recent observations of things galaxies @xcite to provide an independent estimate of @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite use the observed ( low ) star formation in dwarf irregular galaxies to infer the amount of molecular gas present .",
    "this maps smoothly into the observed molecular content of brighter galaxies , with all disks following a relation between surface densities such that @xmath23 ( their equation 33 ) .",
    "this is a relation between local surface densities , while a relation between global masses is desired here . the atomic gas is typically spread over a much larger area than the stars",
    ", so we can not simply assume that the ratio of surface densities is the same as the ratio of masses .",
    "however , the size of the stellar and molecular disk are usually similar @xcite . assuming that they are the same gives @xmath24 in this case",
    ", the amount of molecular mass depends on the stellar mass rather than the atomic gas mass and morphological type as in equation  ( [ etaeqn ] ) .    in order to apply equation ( [ mh2mhi ] ) ,",
    "we need an estimate of the average hi surface density .",
    "this is almost always @xmath25 in low surface brightness galaxies @xcite . in the prototypical case",
    "ddo 154 , @xmath26 at all radii @xcite . taking this value as typical implies that molecular gas is perhaps 9% of the stellar mass of these systems . for galaxies with less than half of their mass in the form of stars",
    ", we again infer that the molecular gas makes up @xmath22 of the baryonic mass .    for either of these estimators ,",
    "the molecular gas content of hi - dominated late type galaxies is small .",
    "so small , in fact , that it is less than the uncertainty in the measurement of the hi mass in most cases . this would seem to be a good working definition of negligible , so rather than make an uncertain correction for the molecular gas mass , we neglect it entirely . in effect , we assume a constant @xmath27 .      we restrict our baryonic mass budget to the components that are actually detected , as discussed above .",
    "it is of course possible that other reservoirs of baryons exist in some undetected form .",
    "there is , however , no direct evidence for baryons in any form that is comparable in mass to the stars and atomic gas .    one conceivable reservoir of baryonic mass is hot gas in the halo .",
    "such a component is expected in some galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "while some hot gas is certainly present , it appears that its density is too low to make a substantial contribution here @xcite .",
    "another suggestion is that some of the dark matter could be in the form of undetected cold molecular gas in galaxy disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a marginal improvement in the scatter of the btfr of @xcite could be obtained by treating @xmath15 as a free parameter , and suggested that the best fit value ( @xmath28 ) implied additional dark baryonic mass in the disk . in more accurate data ,",
    "the scatter is consistent with being caused entirely by observational uncertainties @xcite , nullifying this motivation for dark baryons .    in sum",
    ", there is no compelling evidence for substantial reservoirs of baryons in disk galaxies in any form other than those that are directly detected .",
    "i therefore consider only the physically motivated value of @xmath27 .",
    "obviously , a different result would be obtained if we allowed @xmath15 to include hypothetical mass components ( cf .",

    "the latter is a flux - weighted integral over the velocity field , and lacks the clear physical meaning of a rotation curve .",
    "it is , however , readily obtained from single disk 21 cm observations , whereas obtaining and analyzing interferometric data cubes is considerably more effort intensive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when a full rotation curve is available , one can make different choices about where to measure the circular velocity .",
    "common choices include the maximum observed velocity ( @xmath29 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "indeed , it is not particularly meaningful to define an optical radius for gas rich galaxies , as the scale length of the baryonic mass can be considerably larger than that of the stars alone @xcite .    for quantitative analysis ,",
    "i restrict consideration to cases where @xmath30 is explicitly measured , simply adopting the measured velocity from each source . for comparison purposes ,",

    "i assume @xmath34 .",

    "there exist dynamically cold , rotating disks down to at least @xmath39 , and perhaps as low as @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "there is an enormous amount of data in the literature , but only a finite amount of it pertains to gas dominated galaxies with @xmath11 that also have all the required information for constructing the btfr .",

    "this is done strictly for comparison as the uncertainties for star dominated galaxies are dominated by the choice of stellar imf .",
    "this is the systematic uncertainty that we eliminate by making use of gas dominated galaxies . for gas rich galaxies ,",
    "the major sources of uncertainty are the 21 cm flux measurement and the distance to each galaxy .",
    "the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath30 is usually much smaller than that in mass ( table  [ datatable ] ) , provided that the inclination is reasonably well constrained .",
    "cases where this condition might not be satisfied are discussed and , if suspect , excluded from fitting .",
    "the data of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite constitute the sample of gas rich galaxies for which all the necessary information is available to construct the btfr .",
    "for these galaxies , stellar mass is , by definition , a minority of the baryonic mass . nevertheless , we take care to estimate stellar masses self - consistently . for specificity",

    "other plausible choices make no difference to the result because the gas mass dominates @xcite .",
    "several other samples are included for comparison @xcite .",
    "since these data are not used in the analysis , we make no effort to reconcile them to the same population model and simply adopt the stellar mass estimated by each source . despite the minor differences in the methods used to estimate stellar mass , these data are remarkably consistent with one another .",

    "moreover , the scatter is reduced as we progress from line - widths to resolved measures of the rotation velocity ( left vs.  right panels in fig .",
    "[ btffancyseb ] ) . the improved accuracy with which the rotation velocity is measured",
    "is reflected in reduced scatter .",
    "there are some outliers among the gas rich dwarfs , especially when @xmath32 is used as the velocity estimator .",
    "the two most dramatic outliers from the sample of @xcite are ugc 3755 and kk98 - 65 , which fall far to the left of the main correlation .",

    "[ btffancyseb ] when the hi inclination is used .",
    "the outliers from @xcite are those objects for which rotation is not clearly detected .",

    "three objects from the sample of @xcite stand out from the rest of the data : eso 085-g 088 , am 0433 - 654 , and hipass j1424 - 16b .",
    "eso 085-g 088 has a large velocity error , so its status as an outlier is only marginal .",
    "the other two objects clearly deviate from the rest of the data , including the bulk of the data of @xcite . since we do not have resolved measures of rotation for these objects , it is possible that they , like the single - peaked hi profiles of @xcite , would not show clear evidence of rotation if so observed .",
    "another possibility is that the optical inclinations used by @xcite are systematically in error as discussed in  [ rcsamples ] .",
    "lacking resolved hi observations , we can not make the same consistency check that is possible with the data of @xcite .",
    "the inclination of am 0433 - 654 is @xmath194 and that of hipass j1424 - 16b is @xmath195 .",
    "a shift of @xmath196 dex in @xmath32 would reconcile these galaxies with the other data .",
    "if inclination is responsible , the corresponding inclinations would be @xmath197 for am 0433 - 654 and @xmath198 for hipass j1424 - 16b . from experience with such objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is well within the realm of possibility .",
    "indeed , it would be surprising if something like this did not happen with only optical inclinations to work with .    over all ,",
    "the data paint a consistent picture ( fig .",
    "[ btffancyseb ] ) despite the inevitable concern over the accuracy of a few individual measurements .",
    "the btfr is continuous and linear in log space over five decades in mass .",
    "there is a hint of curvature when @xmath32 is used as the rotation velocity measure , but it is not statistically significant .",
    "there is not even a hint of curvature when resolved rotation curves are available to measure @xmath30 .",
    "we expect the accuracy of the data to improve as we move from integral measures like the line - width to physically meaningful rotation velocities measured from resolved hi data cubes .",
    "this expectation is realized in the reduced scatter seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ btffancyseb ] .",
    "we can quantify this with ordinary least - square fits to the data .",

    "[ btffancyseb ] except those of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we obtain a slope @xmath199 and an intercept @xmath200 . if we perform the same exercise with the rotation curve data in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ btffancyseb ] , we obtain @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "these formal fits have rather different slopes even though the chief difference is in the scatter .",
    "the method of @xcite accounts for uncertainties in both velocity and mass , and can optionally estimate the amount of intrinsic scatter in a sample .",
    "accounting for the stated observational errors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies an intrinsic scatter in the line - width data of @xmath203 dex .",
    "that is , there is 0.2 dex of scatter not explained by observational uncertainty . in contrast , this number is zero for the rotation curve data in the right hand panel : observational errors suffice to explain all the scatter , leaving no room for intrinsic scatter .",
    "this difference in scatter implies some source of variance in line - width measures that is perhaps not accounted for in the stated uncertainties , and not likely to be meaningful to the physics we are interested in here .",
    "at least part of the reason for the difference in fitted slopes is physical : @xmath32 is not a perfect proxy for @xmath30 .",
    "bright galaxies typically have peaked rotation curves with @xmath204 .",
    "line - width measurements do not resolve where emission originates , and are thus sensitive to the maximum velocity rather than that at larger radius .",
    "this immediately skews the slope to shallower values . a similar if less pronounced effect can be seen in optical rotation curves that are resolved but not particularly extended @xcite .    for the physical interpretation of the btfr",
    ", we wish to have as precise a probe as possible of the quantity of interest . for @xmath0cdm",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is typically found to be between @xmath10 and 4 .",
    "most of this variation is due to the prescription adopted for estimating the mass - to - light ratio @xcite , which is by far the strongest systematic effect .",
    "this can be remedied by selecting gas dominated galaxies as described in  [ stellarmasses ] .",
    "@xcite found a slope @xmath205 with a bisector fit while @xcite found @xmath206 from their gas dominated galaxies ( their table 12 ) .",
    "these results appear to be contradictory . repeating the analysis of @xcite",
    ", i obtain the same result . however , simply looking at the data , it is not obvious that they are in conflict .",
    "part of the difference is simply the difference in velocity estimators , as line - widths give shallower slopes than resolved rotation velocities .",
    "their sample is also small , so is easily influenced by a few outliers as discussed above (  [ datacomp ] ) .",
    "this difference between @xmath207 and 4 is precisely the difference between the nominally anticipated slopes in @xmath0cdm  and mond .",
    "the correct answer is therefore of considerable importance and lends itself to controversy .",
    "bear in mind that the data themselves are quite consistent ( fig .",
    "[ btffancyseb ] ) , so any controversy is in the fitting and choice of velocity estimator , not in the data .",
    "the line - width is a convenient proxy for the rotation velocity when resolved rotation curves are unavailable , but not a substitute for them when predictive theories are being tested .    to illustrate the difference between slopes of 3 and 4",
    ", we rotate the btfr into a new coordinate system ( @xmath208,@xmath209 ) parallel to it such that @xmath208 measures the position of a galaxy along the btfr and @xmath209 its deviation perpendicular to it .",

    "[ rotate ] we show the data rotated into the frames defined by the fits of @xcite with slope @xmath212 and @xcite with @xmath213 .",
    "a slope of 4 does a good job of describing the bulk of the data : there is no systematic deviation from the dotted line in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ rotate ] .",
    "in contrast , there is an obvious residual from a slope of 3 in the the top panel .",
    "the data show a clear preference for the steeper slope .",
    "[ rotate ] also illustrates the systematic caused by different mass - to - light ratio estimates for star dominated galaxies .",
    "the galaxies from @xcite are shown twice , once with masses based on @xmath191-band data ( table 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and again with the average of @xmath214 and @xmath191 band stellar masses ( table 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the hybrid @xmath214-@xmath191 masses are nicely consistent with a slope of 3 , while @xmath191 alone prefers a slope of 4 .",
    "while one must choose which band to trust for bright galaxies , this choice is rendered irrelevant for gas dominated galaxies .",
    "we therefore concentrate the rest of our analysis on the gas rich galaxy sample described in   [ rcsamples ] and [ stellarmasses ] .    taking the 47 gas rich galaxies with reasonably trustworthy data ( table  [ datatable ] ) ,",
    "the best fit slope is @xmath215 with intercept @xmath216 .",
    "various methods ( forward , reverse , and maximum likelihood ) all give the same result . of these data ,",
    "the velocity measurements of @xcite are the most challenging : only three of their objects meet the quality criteria of @xcite . excluding the data of @xcite but retaining those of @xcite and @xcite gives @xmath217 from a forward fit , @xmath218 from a reverse fit , and a bisector slope @xcite of @xmath219 .",
    "the corresponding intercepts are @xmath220 , 1.82 , and 1.71 , respectively , with uncertainty @xmath221 .",
    "the slight difference that occurs when also fitting the data of @xcite may result from a slight skew to low velocities , and testifies to the difficulty in obtaining quality data for very slow rotators ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the skew effect becomes more pronounced if we relax the selection criterion that requires consistent optical and hi inclination determinations .",
    "irrespective of these details , these fits are all consistent with one another ( fig .",
    "[ btfgasfit ] ) , and none yield a slope that is meaningfully different from 4 .      an interesting question we can pose to the gas rich galaxy data is what the normalization of the btfr is with slope fixed to 4 .",
    "the gas rich galaxies provide an absolute calibration of the btfr that is very nearly independent of the estimator we use for the stellar mass - to - light ratio . by fixing the slope",
    ", we can sharpen our estimate of the intercept , and also examine higher order moments of the distribution .",
    "in addition to the scatter perpendicular to the btfr , @xmath222 , we can also examine the skew @xmath223 and kurtosis @xmath224 .",

    "table  [ fittab ] gives quantitative estimates for the intercept .",
    "for each combination of samples both a weighted and unweighted estimate is given .",
    "the weighted estimate comes from minimizing @xmath226 by adjusting @xmath227 with fixed slope : we minimize the orthogonal deviations .",
    "the unweighted estimate is made by finding the centroid of the distribution in the orthogonal deviations @xmath209 of the rotated data and requiring the centroid to lie at @xmath228 .",
    "the latter method gives no heed to the accuracy of the data , but is less sensitive to the influence of outliers whose formal uncertainty may understate systematic effects .",

    "this value is of course very similar to the unweighted value ( @xmath232 ) obtained from the @xcite sample alone @xcite .",
    "it is also similar to the value ( @xmath233 ) found by @xcite from star - dominated galaxies , but has the virtue of being completely empirical with little sensitivity to how stellar masses are estimated .",
    "it appears that at this juncture , systematic effects and the necessary assumptions are as limiting as data quality .",

    "the choice of @xmath234 is not important to the star dominated galaxies in @xcite , but we note that adopting it here would cause a change in mass of at most 5% ( for purely gaseous galaxies ) that would drive @xmath235 .",
    "this is at the level of our best guess in the mass of molecular mass . at this level",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the imf that plagues stellar mass estimates also begins to play a role even in gas dominated galaxies . given these considerations , any value in the range 45",
    " @xmath233 is plausible , with values much outside this range quickly becoming less plausible . if we use the btfr to estimate stellar masses @xcite , then more massive star dominated galaxies are consistent with a kroupa imf .",
    "grossly different stellar masses would imply a break in the slope of the relation around @xmath236 where the galaxy population transitions from frequent to infrequent gas domination .",

    "the bulk of this uncertainty ( 0.20 dex ) is provided by the error in the baryonic mass .",
    "velocity uncertainties are less important in most samples , and only rival the uncertainty in mass in the lowest mass systems .",
    "together , the uncertainties in mass and rotation velocity suffice to account for essentially all of the observed scatter .",
    "a robust estimator of the dispersion of a sample is the median absolute deviation ( mad ) .",
    "the dispersion of the various samples about the btfr as measured by their mad is shown in fig .",
    "[ scatter ] .",

    "[ scatter ] shows that indeed @xmath240 1.48mad in most cases .",
    "this leaves little , if any , room for intrinsic scatter in the btfr .",
    "indeed , the only times when scatter measured by the mad significantly exceeds that expected from measurement errors are in the cases where we have identified systematic uncertainties that are not included in the error estimate : in the subset of the sample of @xcite where no signature of rotation has been detected , and in the sample of @xcite where the optical and hi inclination estimates differ greatly .",
    "had we been unaware of these sources of systematic error , we might infer some finite intrinsic scatter .",
    "instead , it appears that including less accurate data merely increases the scatter as one would expect .",
    "the btfr of gas rich galaxies appears to have essentially zero intrinsic scatter .",
    "the same conclusion follows from noting that @xmath226 is close to unity ( table  [ fittab ] ) .",
    "a finite intrinsic width to the relation would cause @xmath241 @xcite .",
    "we can place an upper limit on the scatter by assuming the data are gaussian ( a dubious but conservative assumption for this purpose ) and subtracting the measurement error in quadrature from 1.48mad .",
    "this gives a limit on the intrinsic scatter of @xmath242 dex in mass for the @xcite sample and @xmath243 for the trimmed sample of @xcite .",
    "essentially zero intrinsic scatter is inferred by this method for the gas rich data of @xcite or the star dominated galaxies of @xcite . for the data of @xcite , the expected error exceeds the observed scatter .",
    "this might indicate that the uncertainties ( especially in distance ) have been overestimated , but the sample is small so we should not expect the assumption of a normal distribution to hold . indeed , that is generally true here , which mitigates against there being much intrinsic scatter .",
    "it is common in extragalactic astronomy for correlations between physical quantities to exhibit lots of scatter . in the btfr",
    "we seem to have a relation with little or no intrinsic scatter .",
    "there are some possible couple of caveats to this .",
    "first , it is conceivable that the uncertainties in the data have been overestimated .",
    "second , selection effects might limit the sample to only those objects that obey the btfr .",
    "overestimation of the uncertainties seems unlikely . that @xmath244 is a sign not only that the model is a reasonable description of the data , but also that the uncertainties have been neither over nor underestimated .",
    "even if the data were arbitrarily accurate , so that all of the observed scatter is intrinsic , the intrinsic width of the relation is still small : the observed 0.24 dex .",
    "if anything , this would appear to confirm that the disks of the selected galaxies are well behaved dynamically cold rotators .",
    "if it were otherwise , e.g. , if there were substantial non - circular motions in the disks of these galaxies , then this would be a substantial source of intrinsic scatter and the observed scatter would be much larger @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult to address the issue of potential selection effects .",
    "however , in the time since @xcite , the persistent surprise has been how tight the tully - fisher relation remains when challenged with data for new types of galaxies that we would naively expect to deviate from it . since this exercise",
    "has now been performed by many different observers for many different types of galaxies , it seems unlikely that selection effects play a significant role in suppressing the scatter of the btfr .",
    "we select gas rich galaxies here , but it is already well established that star dominated galaxies obey the btfr with little scatter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the only further selection made here is on data quality . when lower quality data are admitted , the scatter increases ( fig .",
    "[ btffancyseb ] and [ scatter ] ) , just as one would expect .",
    "there is no clear evidence for intrinsic scatter beyond that induced by observational uncertainty and the systematic effects inevitable in astronomical data .",
    "it is impossible to estimate the scatter that might result from including objects that are not already included .",
    "we have restricted our discussion to rotating galaxies , since these are the objects that define the tully - fisher relation .",
    "it is not obvious that it should apply to non - rotating galaxies , though the faber - jackson relation for elliptical galaxies provides an obvious analog .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies fall remarkably close to the btfr with a simple estimate of the equivalent rotation velocity ( @xmath245 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) though the ultrafaint dwarfs fall systematically below it @xcite .",
    "even objects that have no apparent business adhering to to the btfr either do so , or come surprisingly close to doing so ( e.g. , the hi ring in leo ) . among rotating disk galaxies",
    "one would expect differences in the baryonic mass distribution to have some impact on the btfr , just because @xmath246 . and",
    "yet disk dominated spirals , bulge dominated early types , diffuse low surface brightness galaxies , and dwarf irregulars all adhere to the same btfr in spite of their palpably different mass distributions @xcite .",
    "rather than finding greater scatter as we expand our samples beyond the sc i galaxies traditionally utilized in distance scale studies , we find that rotating galaxies of all types adhere to the same btfr .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that there remains some large , unknown population of galaxies in rotational equilibrium that would induce substantial scatter in it .",
    "a persistent problem with interpreting astronomical data is whether gaussian statistics actually apply .",
    "one reason for this is that systematic errors often dominate random ones .",
    "we can check whether this might be an issue here by examining higher order statistics like the skew ( lopsidedness ) and kurtosis ( pointiness ) of the distribution in the deviations @xmath209 perpendicular to the btfr .",
    "if the data are well behaved ( i.e. , distributed normally ) , the skew and kurtosis should be small .    for all three combinations of samples in table [ fittab ] , both the skew and the kurtosis are small : @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "these samples are consistent with normal distributions as they should be if random errors dominate over systematic effects .",
    "this is especially true for the combination of the @xcite and @xcite samples , which have @xmath249 .    for comparison ,",
    "the sample of @xcite has @xmath250 and @xmath251 around their best fit . if we trim the three outlying galaxies discussed in ",
    "[ datacomp ] , the skew is reduced ( @xmath252 ) but the kurtosis grows ( @xmath253 ) .",
    "the negative kurtosis means that the distribution is flat - topped : it does not have a well - defined central peak as it should if the data simply scatter around the correct relation .",
    "these data are not distributed normally .",

    "i would expect @xmath271 and @xmath273 to fill out some distribution of values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there is no obvious reason why these distributions should be either narrow or closely coupled .",

    "another expected source of scatter is the triaxiality of dark matter halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the gravitational potential is non - symmetric , then the observed velocity depends on the viewing angle with respect to the principle axis of the potential .",
    "otherwise identical galaxies will appear to have difference @xmath30 depending on how they happen to be oriented on the sky .",
    "a significant degree of non - axisymmetry is clearly excluded @xcite .",
    "this constraint might be lessened by the rounding of dark matter halos by the formation of the baryonic disk , but the disk needs to be heavy enough to have an impact .",
    "@xcite find that disks need to be at least half maximal to have a significant impact on their halos .",
    "the low surface brightness disks that make up the majority of the gas rich galaxy sample typically fall a factor of two below this level @xcite .",

    "it is difficult to accommodate all the expected sources of scatter in the error budget .",

    "the higher value gives a tolerable approximation to high mass spirals while the lower value is appropriate to gas dominated dwarfs .",
    "a single universal value , as often assumed in galaxy formation modeling , does not work simply because the slope of the btfr is steeper than the @xmath0cdm  halo mass  rotation velocity relation .",

    "the model of @xcite exhibits a substantial scatter and dependence on the distribution of stellar mass .",
    "this is natural : the distribution of baryonic mass should matter @xcite .",
    "this model matches the high mass end of the observed btfr reasonably well , but over - predicts the mass in galaxies with @xmath311 .",
    "nevertheless , this model , like that of @xcite , provides an honest example of what we most naturally expect from @xmath0cdm : a substantial amount of scatter about a relation with a slope of approximately 3 .",

    "this might be remedied by adopting a different imf , but the change would have to be substantial : a factor of 3 or so in stellar mass .",

    "would we recognize these objects as normal disk galaxies ?",
    "resolution also remains an issue in numerical modeling .",
    "the model galaxies of @xcite are all in the star dominated regime .",
    "only the one model galaxy of @xcite resides in the regime of gas dominated galaxies where the comparison is most clean .",
    "comparison with the millenium simulation suggests that simulated galaxies might well follow the observed slope and normalization of the btfr down to low rotation velocities ( white & guo 2011 , private communication ) .",
    "the critical issue of the intrinsic scatter that should be exhibited by low mass model galaxies in such simulations remains open .",
    "detailed numerical simulations appear to have finally reached the point where they can produce quantitatively realistic model galaxies .",
    "this is clearly a great success .",
    "it remains to be seen if they can provide a satisfactory explanation for the small intrinsic scatter in the btfr .",
    "if they can , then the question becomes whether feedback prescriptions that accomplish this feat correspond to how feedback works in nature .      among alternatives to dark matter , one , mond @xcite , makes strong _ a priori _ predictions about the btfr , which is a consequence of the form of the force law in mond .",
    "this deviates from purely newtonian at small accelerations , @xmath319 , where @xmath5 is the one new parameter introduced by the theory .",
    "the value of @xmath5 must be constrained by observation ( @xmath320 : * ? ? ?",

    "there are several consequences of equation  [ eqn : mondtf ] @xcite .",
    "the tully - fisher relation is absolute , being a direct consequence of the force law .",
    "there should be no intrinsic scatter .",
    "the normalization is set by constants of nature .",
    "contrary to the case in newtonian dynamics , the circular velocity does not depend on the radial extent of the mass distribution , so there is no dependence on surface brightness or scale length .",
    "this naturally explains the lack of observed size or surface brightness residuals from the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite specifically predicted that low surface brightness galaxies would share the same tully - fisher relation , with the same normalization , as high surface brightness spirals .",
    "this prediction was subsequently confirmed @xcite .",
    "the data for gas rich galaxies now provides the opportunity to test another _ a priori _ prediction .",
    "the circular velocities of the gas rich dwarfs considered here are measured .",
    "their baryonic masses are observed .",
    "their location on the btfr is fixed .",
    "consequently , the gas rich dwarfs provide a test of the mond prediction with _ zero _ free parameters .",
    "the results of this test is shown in fig .",
    "[ btfmond ] . even though the value of @xmath5 was set by early fits to bright spirals ( @xmath327 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , equation  [ eqn : mondtf ] fits the data for much lower mass galaxies well .",
    "the gas rich dwarfs follow the prediction of mond with no fitting whatsoever @xcite .",
    "there was no guarantee that mond would pass the test posed by gas rich galaxies .",
    "a tully - fisher type relation is built into the mond force law , but its slope is fixed and its normalization is constrained by star dominated galaxies . the data for gas rich galaxies could have fallen anywhere in the btfr plane .",
    "they might have exhibited the slope of 3 that is more natural to @xmath0cdm .",
    "instead , they fall along the one and only line permitted in mond .      the data for gas rich galaxies are consistent with existing estimates of the acceleration constant @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we can reverse the question , and ask what the best value of @xmath5 is according to these data .",
    "the best fit intercept of the btfr already contains this information , and the corresponding value of @xmath5 is given in table [ fittab ] .",
    "there are some subtle issues to consider in calibrating @xmath5 .",
    "this has previously been done by fits to full rotation curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these contain more information than simply the outer circular velocity , but require an additional assumption .",
    "in particular , a form for the function that interpolates between the newtonian and mond regimes must be assumed .",
    "for an assumed form , the best fit mass - to - light ratio must be found simultaneously with the best fit value of @xmath5 . there is not much range allowed in either of these parameters , but there can be covariance between them , so it is challenging to disentangle them uniquely . here",
    ", the data are not so precise , and we make no use of the information in the shape of the rotation curve , only its outer value . however , this approach has the virtue of making a minimum of assumptions and using mass estimates that are completely independent of the theory .",
    "strictly speaking , equation [ eqn : mondtf ] applies at infinite distance from an isolated point mass .",
    "real galaxies are not point masses , and @xmath30 is measured at a finite radius .",
    "consequently , the intercept of the empirical btfr is related to the acceleration constant of mond by @xmath328 where @xmath329 is a factor of order unity that accounts for the finite size and non - spherical geometry of galaxies .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath330 from purely geometrical considerations  thin disks rotate faster than the equivalent spherical mass distribution . the sample discussed by @xcite",
    "has mond fits performed for @xmath327 and a separate fit for the btfr yielding @xmath37 .",
    "this gives an empirical estimate of @xmath331 which i adopt here .",
    "the gas rich galaxy data thus give @xmath332 the uncertainty here includes the formal uncertainty in @xmath333 ( equation [ bestfita ] ) plus an allowance for 20% uncertainty in @xmath329 .",
    "it is conceivable that there could be a small systematic offset in the mean value of @xmath329 between gas and star dominated galaxies .",
    "detailed rotation curve fits to some of the same galaxies suggest @xmath334 @xcite .",
    "this becomes @xmath335 if we exercise the same quality control on the data as applied here .",
    "this gives some idea of the systematic uncertainty and the impact of the best - fit stellar mass - to - light ratio when it is treated as a fitting parameter along with @xmath5 .",
    "however , data quality remains the paramount issue .",
    "the btfr is clearly a success of mond , despite its many other drawbacks .",
    "further tests are possible , as adherence to the btfr does not guarantee that it is possible to obtain an acceptable fit to the entire rotation curve of each galaxy . while mond is known to do quite well in some gas rich galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it may have problems in others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* where again the issue appears to be with the inclination ) .",
    "it is particularly challenging to fit the full rotation curve of ngc 3198 @xcite , the most massive galaxy to meet the gas rich criterion imposed here .",
    "perhaps this suffices to falsify mond , but we should not be so eager to disbelieve mond as a theory that we ignore the remarkable empirical virtues of the simple formula suggested by @xcite .",
    "there are other suggestions for modifying gravitational theory besides mond .",
    "conformal weyl gravity @xcite and mog @xcite offer two examples .",
    "if these theories can fit rotation curves @xcite , then they will also fit the btfr @xcite .",
    "however , i am not aware of a clear _ a priori _ prediction of this phenomenon by any theory other than mond .",
    "the baryonic mass  velocity relation provides an important test of @xmath0cdm  and alternatives like mond .",
    "i have assembled recent data for gas rich rotating galaxies in order to test these theories . with @xmath11 , the location of these objects in the baryonic mass  rotation velocity plane",
    "is effectively measured directly from observations without the usual systematic uncertainty in the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "a long standing prediction @xcite of mond is that rotating galaxies will fall on a single mass  velocity relation with slope 4 : @xmath326 .",
    "this prediction is realized in multiple independent data sets .",

    "* ) succeed in reproducing the observed phenomenology .",
