    "atmospheric dispersion models all have the goal to forecast where a pollutant , if released into the atmosphere , ends up .",
    "there are many applications , e.g. planning where a factory should be located ( to reduce the risk in case of an accident ) which requires mainly a local model , or e.g. forecasting which regions that would be affected by a nuclear power plant incident ( like the fukushima disaster ) which mainly requires a regional or global model .",
    "an equally natural question to ask is : given that we have detected a pollutant somewhere , can we deduce where the source was located ? if not before , this inverse problem became very important in the wake of the chernobyl accident . in that case",
    "the radioactive pollution triggered sensors in europe before any news of the accident was released . pinpointing the location of the source",
    "could be done by guessing the location , strength , and time of the accident and running the dispersion model forward to see whether it would give the observed measurements . unless the guess is an educated one this can be a costly process .",
    "the alternative is to solve the inverse problem .",
    "having a solution to the inverse problem , that is , an estimate of the parameters in the source function , enables subsequent forward dispersion modelling to gain a much better understanding of the current state of affairs ( a better situation analysis ) . alternatively",
    "the source estimate may be a crucial part of forensic work , for example trying to calculate the amount of leaked radioactive substances following the accidents in chernobyl @xcite and fukushima @xcite or pinpointing nuclear test sites @xcite .    a number of methods to solve the inverse problem have been suggested .",
    "in addition to the two main contenders optimisation algorithms and bayesian statistics there are methods like footprint analysis , e.g. the survey article @xcite , influence area @xcite and robertson2004 , directly inverting the problem and trying to overcome any issues associated with ill - conditioning , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "often the methods are designed to bear only on a subclass of inverse dispersion problems by a priori conditioning on the number of sources , the type of source , or the dispersion model employed . in the bayesian approach to the inverse problem",
    "the source is estimated from a so called a posteriori probability distribution function which is obtained by calculating a likelihood function and weighing it with any a priori information that one has at hand ( see e.g. @xcite for an introduction to general bayesian inverse problems , and @xcite for an early reference ) .",
    "this method avoids the pitfalls of ill - conditioning which are often associated with directly inverted problems and adds the benefit of allowing uncertainties in models and measurements to be handled in a tractable fashion . in a series of papers the bayesian approach has been adapted to bear on inverse dispersion problems : in @xcite the case with one source with unknown position and unknown but constant source strength was treated .",
    "@xcite deals with the case where there is a known number of sources in given locations but where the source strengths are unknown ( there is also an interesting comparison of the results to those obtained with a directly inverted model where the problems of ill - conditioning have been alleviated by singular value decomposition ) .",
    "this study was generalised in @xcite and @xcite to cover the situation where there is an unknown number of sources in unknown positions , where the only assumption on each source is that during emission the source strength is constant .",
    "the case with an unknown number of sources is much harder than working with a fixed number of sources as the dimension of the parameter space is unknown . in @xcite and @xcite this problem was overcome by using the method reversible jump monte carlo markov chain @xcite to sample from the posterior probability distribution function with an unknown number of dimensions ( the dimension is one of the parameters that needs to be estimated ) . in @xcite a recursive method is proposed to deal with same issue .    under the umbrella of the optimisation method",
    "we find all the various ways of setting up the inverse dispersion problem so that its solution is given as the solution of a least - squares fitting problem . as for the bayesian method the body of literature mostly covers the case where it is a priori known that there is only one single source ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "there are exceptions , e.g.in @xcite the least - squares method presented in iss2012 is generalised to cover an unknown number of point sources , and in @xcite the space - time has been discretised and optimal source term is constructed by forming a union of `` box - sources '' ( the smallest resolution is given by the grid box , so `` box - source '' seems the appropriate term instead of point source ) .    in this paper",
    "we are developing a framework for describing inverse dispersion problems .",
    "the framework relies on using measure theoretic ideas and methods to study the general linear inverse dispersion problem without making a priori assumptions on e.g. the number of sources , their emission patterns or their distribution in the spatio - temporal domain . as such , the framework is non - parametric but since the term non - parametric seems to be overloaded we refrain from using it to describe the framework .",
    "we begin by setting up the linear inverse problem and then we present a one - dimensional toy problem that motivate the use of measures rather than probability densities .",
    "then we turn to the problem of determining under which conditions a given set of sensor data can be generated by a source chosen from a given class of sources . as a warm - up we consider linear combinations of base source measures in both the invertible case and the over determined case .",
    "the arguments are based on finding appropriate cones in the space of positive measures ( describing the source ) and in the space of sensor measurements.we then build on this to generalise the analysis to the case where the source is chosen from a closed cone of measures ( we dispense of the assumption of having a finite number of base sources ) , theorem [ thm : compactcondition2 ] . while theorem [ thm : compactcondition2 ] is certainly interesting in its own right explaining when a measurement can be realised the analysis also allows for a derivation of the main result of the paper : conditions under which the least squares optimisation problem is well - defined , theorem [ thm : leastsquare ] .",
    "in addition to these results we also characterise the set of measurements when a source is approximated by a sequence of instantaneous point sources , theorem [ thm : convexconicalhull ] .",
    "the measure theoretic approach that is presented in this paper introduces a machinery which we believe will be useful in future studies where rigorous results on general linear inverse dispersion problem are sought .",
    "indeed , while not solving any particular inverse dispersion problem , the method is not hampered by any peculiarities that a given set of parameters could have introduced .",
    "the atmospheric dispersion problem that we are interested in can be formulated in terms of a transition probability @xmath0 , where @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a time interval and @xmath3 is a spatial domain .",
    "the transition probability density expresses the probability for a particle released at the time - space point @xmath4 to reside in the time - space point @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "we note that @xmath7 when @xmath8 .",
    "the particles whose dispersion is governed by this transition probability is assumed to originate from a source @xmath9 .",
    "the source @xmath9 is assumed to be a positive measure on @xmath10 ( that is , the word `` source '' is used in the strict sense ; no sinks are considered in this paper ) . in this way",
    "the total mass  @xmath11 released from the source is given by integrating the source measure @xmath9 over its support@xmath12the quantity that is usually desired as output from a dispersion model is the concentration of the pollutant in a given space - time point .",
    "since @xmath9 has its support on @xmath10 and the transition probability describes the dynamics of the released substance the concentration @xmath13 is obtained by weighing all released particles ( released at some @xmath4 with @xmath14 ) with the probability that they have been transported from @xmath4 to @xmath5@xmath15while @xmath13 is the predicted concentration at the space time point @xmath5 the sensor may not have the resolution to make an ideal measurement from the concentration field @xmath13 , indeed the sensor may perform some form of averaging in both space and time to yield the sensor response @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the averaging process in the sensor can be described by a probability measure @xmath17 ( usually referred to as the sensor - filter function ) on @xmath10 , and hence we express the sensor response as@xmath18according to fubini s theorem ( _ rudin , theorem 8.8 p. 164",
    "_ ) , this can be written as@xmath19 in case @xmath9 and @xmath17 are given by square ",
    "integrable spacetime densities @xmath20 , @xmath21 , then @xmath22 and @xmath23 are also square  integrable spacetime densities , and @xmath24where the inner product is defined by @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 is called the _",
    "adjoint concentration_. we want to allow sources and measurements with singular parts .",
    "let us consider combinations of square ",
    "integrable spacetime densities and instantaneous point masses . to this end",
    "we generalize @xmath22 and @xmath26 to measures of the form    @xmath27which we call _ primal measures _ , and we generalize @xmath23 and @xmath28 to measures of the form @xmath29which we call _ dual measures_. we would like to have a generalization of ( [ eqn : adjointfcns ] ) to @xmath30for a suitable bilinear map @xmath31 , which implies that @xmath32this definition makes sense only if    * @xmath33 is continuous at @xmath34 so the application of @xmath35 in @xmath36 is appropriate * @xmath37 is continuous at @xmath38 so the application of @xmath39 in @xmath40 is appropriate * the @xmath34 s are disjoint from the @xmath41 s , because multiplication of point masses with common support is not defined .",
    "in other words , we are not allowed to make an instantaneous point measurements at the spacetime location of an instantaneous point source .",
    "in fact , in case @xmath42 and @xmath43 the two first conditions implies the third , because of the connection between @xmath9 and @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , since @xmath9 is a primal measure we have@xmath45so @xmath44 has no singular part ( point masses ) and the density @xmath46 has singularities at @xmath47 and hence can not be continuous there . by a similar argument , @xmath48 can not have any singular part .    to summarize",
    ", we have a generalization ( [ eqn : adjointmeasures ] ) of the adjoint to measures , with the inner product @xmath49 , a bilinear form , is replaced by a bilinear mapping @xmath50 on the spaces of primal and adjoint measures .",
    "the common part is the subspace of square ",
    "integrable densities , on which the bilinear mapping @xmath51 coincides with the inner product @xmath52 . since the measures @xmath44 and @xmath48 do not have singular parts , we henceforth identify them with their densities @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and refer to @xmath23 as the adjoint concentration , although it is not an adjoint in the usual hilbert space sense .",
    "similar formulas apply for other combinations of singular measures like continuous or instantaneous point , line , area or volume sources or measurements , but is not elaborated on further here .",
    "let us now use the definition of @xmath13 to rewrite this expression in the following way@xmath53by defining the _ adjoint concentration field _ @xmath54 as@xmath55we get@xmath56hence we have two equivalent ways of calculating the sensor response@xmath57which is the dual relationship between the forward and the adjoint description of the dispersion problem .",
    "we note that equation ( def_adjoint ) describing the adjoint concentration field is evolving backwards in time : we may view the transition probability as moving adjoint particles released by @xmath17 backwards in time and space .",
    "the main advantage of using the adjoint representation in inverse dispersion modelling is computational efficiency .",
    "this is a well - documented fact , see for example @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the adjoint concentration field @xmath23 is independent of the source function @xmath9 , and the concentration field @xmath22 is independent of the sensor - filter function @xmath17 .",
    "the dispersion problem predicts how a pollutant from a source spreads in the atmosphere . from an abstract point of view",
    "this problem can be seen as a problem of mapping of measures : the source @xmath9 can be viewed as a measure in the spatio - temporal domain @xmath10 that is being mapped via the dispersion equations into a scalar function @xmath22 ( the concentration ) , from which we make measurements represented by a probability measure @xmath17 , defining the averaging of the concentration function @xmath22 . from this level of abstraction the adjoint version of",
    "the problem is very similar . in this case",
    "the adjoint equations maps a probability measure @xmath17 on @xmath10 representing a measurement in a sensor to a scalar function @xmath23 ( adjoint concentration ) from which we can make `` adjoint measurements '' using a source measure @xmath9 acting on the adjoint concentration @xmath23 .",
    "( depending on the scaling of the problem the adjoint concentration @xmath58 may not be a proper concentration dimensionally . ) in view of this light , asking questions about the sensor response in the forward problem or asking questions about the source in the inverse problem are very similar .",
    "based on this observation we therefore propose to adopt a measure theoretic approach and we develop a mathematical framework for studying the inverse problem . while we are omitting the analysis of the forward problem in this paper we note that treating this problem is completely analogous .",
    "studying the problem in this generality will not allow us to solve any particular inverse dispersion problem , but it will allow us to draw general conclusions about whole classes of problems .",
    "one particular advantage of this approach hence lies in the fact that we avoid difficulties that may be associated with a particular problem and its parameters - of course , these will have to be addressed when the particular problem is to be solved .",

    "hence point sources must be allowed .",
    "since any measure can be locally approximated ( by weak convergence of measures ) by a sequence of finite linear combinations of point sources , it is natural to allow sources given by finite measures .",
    "the purpose of this section is to characterize all possible measurement values obtainable when @xmath9 is a linear combination of a given finite number of base sources . in other words",

    "note also that it suffices to find a minimizer in the generating set @xmath217 , and compute the scaling afterwards .",
    "let @xmath177 be the set of single instantaneous point sources in a compact set @xmath240 .",
    "this is a uniformly tight , weakly closed set of measures with uniformly bounded and uniformly positive total masses , representing instantaneous point sources of unit mass .",
    "the positive cone @xmath297 generated by @xmath338 represents all instantaneous point sources supported in @xmath242 .",

    "we have presented a measure theoretic framework for studying the adjoint dispersion problem . this framework and the accompanying measure theoretic machinery enabled us to derive results for general linear inverse dispersion problems without making prior assumptions on the number of sources , their emission patterns and so on .",

    "we investigated when a given set of sensor data can be realisable from a linear combination of source measures chosen from some subset of all positive measures .",
    "then we shifted the view from working with a fixed set of measurement values , to asking ( and answering ) the question : if the source is chosen from a closed cone of positive measures , what are the possible measurement values that this source can produce ?",
