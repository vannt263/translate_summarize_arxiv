    "the top quark may be a window to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "its mass near the electroweak scale and its large coupling to the higgs boson may be crucial to understanding the electroweak sector beyond the sm .",
    "now that the sm - like higgs boson has been observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite with a relatively light mass of about 125 gev , the assumed `` naturalness '' of the higgs sector @xcite suggests the existence of a partner of the top quark below or near the tev scale , motivating theories such as weak - scale supersymmetry , little higgs , and extra dimensions ( either warped or universal ) .",
    "vacuum stability of the electroweak potential also indicates the need for new physics to balance the large top - quark contribution .",
    "the top quark hence provides a possible early indicator of new physics and a good probe of a wide variety of new - physics scenarios .",
    "the lhc is a top factory , producing a hundred times more @xmath4 pairs from qcd processes than were produced at the tevatron .",
    "top - quark production is well understood in the sm .",
    "thus any new physics contributions will be on top of a well - known and well - measured , albeit large , background . with the discovery era ushered in by the lhc",
    ", it would be prudent to keep the initial search as general as possible .    in this work , we take a model - independent approach to searching for new physics processes of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a massive new particle with the same gauge quantum numbers as the top quark and @xmath7 is an electrically and color neutral stable particle .",
    "the weakly interacting @xmath7 could be a constituent of dark matter , which would manifest itself as missing energy in a collider detector .",
    "we systematically consider different spin configurations ( 0 , 1/2 , and 1 ) for the new particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "each combination is exemplified by particles in well - motivated new - physics models ( see the next section for details ) .",
    "for example , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xmath6 could be a scalar top and @xmath7 the lightest neutralino .",
    "this case has been studied extensively in the literature ( see , for example , refs .",
    "however , we do not limit ourselves to specific particles in a particular model ; rather , we undertake a general categorization , assuming merely a mass accessible at the lhc and a discrete symmetry that ensures the stability of @xmath7 . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict consideration to processes that involve only the top partner , @xmath6 , and the dark - matter candidate , @xmath7 , as new particles .    in order to distinguish experimentally between the different possibilities",
    ", one needs to determine the spins and couplings of the new particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in this paper , several observables for this purpose",
    "are proposed and their usefulness is demonstrated in a realistic monte carlo simulation . to avoid ambiguities due to model - dependent branching fractions , we do not consider the total cross section in this set of variables .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ setup ]",
    "we introduce the model - independent classification of new - physics top partners and their interactions .",
    "the production of these particles at the lhc is discussed in section  [ channels ] , while the current bounds from collider searches are summarized in section  [ bounds ] . in section  [ sigsel ] , the expected reach of the lhc for this class of processes is analyzed through a detailed monte carlo simulation . the determination of relevant properties of the new particles , such as mass , spin and couplings , and the discrimination between models are discussed in section [ props ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section  [ concl ] .",
    "colored particles can be copiously produced at the lhc by strong qcd interactions .",
    "let @xmath6 denote a new color - triplet particle with charge + 2/3 .",
    "@xmath6 and its antiparticle can be produced at leading order in qcd by the processes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prodxy ]  ( left ) .",
    "we shall not consider the production of a single new particle via yukawa - type interactions : since they are strongly model - dependent and are subject to strong constraints from flavor physics , it is assumed that such vertices are forbidden by a discrete symmetry .",
    "@xmath6 decays to a new particle that is a color singlet , denoted @xmath7 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : prodxy ]  ( right ) ] , which will show as missing energy in a collider experiment .    ' '' ''    [ fig : prodxy ]    there are four possible combinations of spins that allow a coupling between @xmath7 , @xmath6 and the sm top quark , @xmath8 .",
    "these are listed , with the relevant couplings and sample model decays , in table  [ tab : models1 ] . for fermions",
    "we allow a general chirality structure .",
    "we shall henceforth refer to these scenarios as models i , ii , iii , and iv .",
    "._quantum numbers and couplings of the new particles @xmath7 and @xmath6 , which interact with the sm top quark , @xmath8 . in the last column ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the scalar top and lightest neutralino in the mssm , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the first - level kaluza - klein excitations of the top , the photon , and an extra - dimensional component of a photon , respectively , in universal extra dimensions ( ued ) @xcite . finally , @xmath14 is the vector superpartner in a supersymmetric model with an extended gauge sector @xcite . _",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ , < , < \" , ]     the numbers refer to the purely statistical significance",
    ". however , at this level of precision , systematic errors may be important .",
    "a potentially large systematic effect stems from the uncertainty of the new - particle masses , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "while the mass difference @xmath17 can be determined rather precisely , the overall mass scale can be measured with only 2030% accuracy ; see section  [ masses ] .",
    "we have estimated the effect of this uncertainty by comparing two event samples with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which differ in @xmath15 by roughly 30% .",
    "we have found that this mass uncertainty reduces the statistical significance of the spin discrimination by about 20% ; the values of @xmath20 that account for this systematic error are about 50% greater than those quoted above .    in conclusion ,",
    "the determination of the spin of the top partner , @xmath6 , is possible with very moderate amounts of data .",
    "on the other hand , the distinction between models ii and iii , which both have a fermionic @xmath6 but differ in the spin of the singlet @xmath7 , is much more difficult . after surveying more than a dozen different kinematic variables based on the top - quark momenta , we found no significant difference between scenarios ii and iii for any of them .",
    "this finding agrees with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , more information can be obtained from observables that are sensitive to the top - quark polarization , as will be discussed next .",
    "the chirality structure of the decay @xmath22 ( that is , the relative contributions of left- and right - handed chiral couplings ) leaves an imprint on the polarization of the top quark , which can be analyzed through angular distributions of the top - quark decay products .",
    "this method is particularly effective when the mass difference between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is large ( @xmath23 ) , so that the top quark is energetic and therefore the helicity is preserved , reflecting the chirality .",
    "for instance , one can look at the angle @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) of the @xmath26 quark ( lepton ) with respect to the top - quark boost direction in the top rest frame .",
    "because the @xmath26 quark is always left - handed , it is emitted predominantly in the forward direction ( @xmath27 ) if the top quark is left - handed , but mostly in the backward direction ( @xmath28 ) if the top quark is right - handed .    in practice , even if the top quark is produced fully polarized in the decay @xmath29 , some of the polarization is washed out by the mass of the top , but the @xmath28 distribution will still exhibit a characteristic difference between left- and right - handed @xmath30 couplings .    in the following",
    ", we shall illustrate this behavior using a parton - level simulation with calchep .",
    "we shall focus on the leptonically decaying top quark , since it has a cleaner final state .",
    "the top - quark rest frame can not be reconstructed because of the unobserved neutrino momentum , so we analyze the angular distribution in the rest frame of the visible @xmath31 system instead .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] .",
    "( -2,4)model i(-2,4)model ii + ( -2,5)model iii(-2,5)model iv    as fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] shows , the distribution is skewed to smaller values of @xmath32 or , equivalently , larger values of @xmath33 in the case of a left - handed @xmath30 coupling ( black curves ) than in the right - handed case ( red curves ) . for a mixed case with non - zero left- and right - handed components , one obtains a distribution that lies between the black and red curves",
    "this qualitative behavior is the same for all four spin combinations in table  [ tab : models1 ] , although they differ from each other in the detailed shape of the distribution . in particular , cases ii and iii have distinctly different shapes ; hence , the analysis of this observable may allow one to determine not only the chirality of the @xmath30 coupling but also the spin of the @xmath7 particle .",
    "such a determination is not possible with observables that treat the top quarks as basic objects .",
    "furthermore , one can probe the chirality even with limited statistics by using two bins and forming the asymmetry @xmath34 from fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] , one can see that when @xmath35 is about @xmath36 @xmath37 will be most sensitive to the chirality of the coupling .",
    "table  [ tab : topasym ] shows the asymmetry @xmath38 for models i  iv with two choices of the masses @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the usefulness of @xmath38 for the determination of the coupling is enhanced by its relative insensitivity to the spin and mass combinations .",

    "the sm - like higgs boson has been observed at the lhc with a relatively light mass of about 125 gev .",
    "the `` naturalness '' argument of the higgs sector suggests the existence of partners of the sm particles , especially the heavy top quark .",
    "the top quark may thus hold the key to new physics associated with the electroweak symmetry - breaking sector , because of its enhanced coupling to the higgs sector . in this paper , we have systematically categorized the generic interactions of a new particle that couples to the top quark and a stable neutral particle , which serves as a candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "we have considered all possible assignments of spin 0 , @xmath42 and 1 for either of the two new particles .    in the search for new physics involving top quarks and its partners at the lhc",
    ", the experimental signatures may be distinctive , but challenging to disentangle .",
    "pair production of the massive top partners leads to a signature of a @xmath43 pair plus missing energy , which is difficult to separate from the large sm @xmath43 background .",
    "we have presented a set of optimized selection cuts for isolating this new physics signal at the 8 and 14  tev runs of the lhc .",
    "we have found that , at 14  tev with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath0 , a spin - zero top partner can be observed at the 5@xmath1 level up to a mass of 675  gev , while for a spin-@xmath42 top partner the reach extends to 945  gev .",
    "if a process of this type is discovered at the lhc , it will be imperative to determine the spins and couplings of the new particles , in order to understand the underlying physics mechanism .",
    "we have proposed a strategy to extract these properties from experimental data by means of suitable differential distributions of the final - state products . with this approach",
    ", a spin-0 top partner with mass of about 300  gev can be discriminated from spin-@xmath42 and spin-1 particles at the 5@xmath1 level with a luminosity of 10  fb@xmath0 at 14  tev .",
    "furthermore , the structure of the coupling that mediates the decay of the top partner into a top quark and a massive neutral particle can be analyzed by measurement of the polarization of the final - state top quarks .",
    "this method allows one to distinguish clearly between left - handed , right - handed , and vector couplings .",
    "most importantly , the proposed observables for spin and coupling determination are insensitive to unknown branching fractions and depend only mildly on the masses of the new particles .    in conclusion ,",
    "the lhc will allow us to observe and study top partners with mass up to about 1  tev .",
    "this program will shed light on the interplay of the higgs - boson and top - quark sectors and may elucidate the concept of naturalness .",
