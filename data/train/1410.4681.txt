    "<S> in this work , we perform the mathematical analysis of a coupled system of two reaction - diffusion - advection equations and danckwerts boundary conditions , which models the interaction between a microbial population ( e.g. , bacterias ) and a diluted substrate ( e.g. , nitrate ) in a continuous flow bioreactor </S>",
    "<S> . this type of bioreactor can be used , for instance , for water treatment . </S>",
    "<S> first , we prove the existence and uniqueness of solution , under the hypothesis of linear reaction by using classical results for linear parabolic boundary value problems . </S>",
    "<S> next , we prove the existence and uniqueness of solution for some nonlinear reactions by applying _ schauder fixed point theorem _ and the theorem obtained for the linear case . </S>",
    "<S> results about the nonnegativeness and boundedness of the solution are also proved here . </S>"
