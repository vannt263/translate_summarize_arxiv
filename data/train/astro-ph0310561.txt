    "the concept of intracluster starlight ( icl ) , or stars between the galaxies in galaxy clusters is not a new one : it was first proposed over 50 years ago ( zwicky 1951 ) .",
    "however , progress in studying icl has been slow due to its low surface brightness , which is less than 1% of the brightness of the night sky .",
    "this is unfortunate , because icl is a powerful probe of the evolution of galaxies in clusters ( dressler 1984 ) , and of cluster evolution overall .",
    "it is also an important part of the ejection of matter out of galaxies discussed at this conference .",
    "we have undertaken a deep imaging survey of galaxy clusters , intended to quantify the properties of icl as a function of environment , and overall galaxy cluster properties . from our deep imaging , with careful attention to systematic errors ( morrison , boroson , & harding 1994 ) , we are able to measure the icl to faint surface brightnesses many magnitudes below that of the night sky ( @xmath0 @xmath1 2628 ) . in tandem with the observations",
    ", we are constructing numerical simulations of galaxy clusters in a cosmological context , similar to those of dubinski ( 1998 ) . here",
    "we summarize some recent results : previous results can be found in feldmeier ( 2002 ) .",
    "models of intracluster star production predict that intracluster light may not always be in a smooth , elliptically symmetric , component but instead can be in tidal tails and arcs ( moore 1996 ; napolitano 2003 ) . in our deep imaging survey , we have found intracluster tidal debris in almost every cluster we have surveyed ( see figure  1 for one of the most striking examples ) .",
    "however , at this time , we have detected more plume - like structures than the long arcs originally predicted by the models .",
    "since only half of the survey has been completely reduced , the significance of this result is unclear .",
    "determining the amount of icl from our imaging observations is non - trivial because it is difficult to separate the outer edges of galaxies from the underlying background icl . to make a model - independent estimate of icl fraction in the clusters observed , we used an isophotal cutoff .",
    "the exact value of the cutoff is problematic , so we have adopted a range of values to set reasonable limits .",
    "we find that for the clusters surveyed thus far , the amount of icl is 1020% , including a correction for the edges of galaxies still unmasked .",
    "this is similar to the amount of intracluster light found in the nearby virgo and fornax clusters ( see arnaboldi , this volume ) .",
