    "a principal advantage of the sgi is that it is finite - range , so no energy cutoff is , in principle , needed .",
    "moreover , the surface delta term in ( [ eq1 ] ) simplifies the calculation of two - body matrix elements , because they can be reduced to one - dimensional radial integrals .",
    "( in the case of other finite - range interactions , such as the gogny force @xcite , the radial integrals are two - dimensional . )",

    "the valence space for protons and neutrons consists of the @xmath92 and @xmath154 ghf resonant states , calculated for each nucleus , and the @xmath155 and @xmath156 @xmath157 , respectively complex and real continua generated by the same potential .",
    "these continua extend from @xmath112$]=0 to @xmath112$]=8@xmath102 , and they are discretized with 14 points ( i.e. , @xmath103=14 ) .",

    "for the lightest isotopes considered , it is a very broad resonant state ( @xmath158 5 mev ) , and , on physics grounds , it is more justified to simply take a real @xmath156 contour , so the completeness relation is still fulfilled .",
    "altogether , we have 15 @xmath159 and 14 or 15 @xmath160 ghf shells in the gsm calculation .",
    "the imaginary parts of @xmath0-values of the discretized continua are chosen to minimize the error made in calculating the imaginary parts of energies of the many - body states .",
    "another continua , such as @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 are neglected , as they can be chosen to be real and would only induce a renormalization of the two - body interaction .",

    ", however , solving a gsm problem for @xmath3li in the full @xmath165 ghf space is not possible within a reasonable computing time .",
    "having defined a discretized ghf basis , we construct the many - body slater determinants from all s.p . basis states ( resonant and scattering ) , keeping only those with at most two particles in the non - resonant continuum . indeed , according to our tests , as the two - body hamiltonian is diagonalized in its optimal ghf basis , the weight of configurations involving more than two particles in the continuum is usually quite small , and they are neglected in the following . to illustrate this point , let us consider the @xmath166=@xmath167 ground state of @xmath145li . since , in this case , there are only three valence particle , the complete calculation is possible .",
    "as seen in table  [ tables_gs_li7_trunc ] , the weight of the component with three particles in the non - resonant continuum , @xmath168 $ ] is indeed two orders of magnitude smaller than other configurations weights .",

    "nevertheless , it is necessary to take into account the @xmath154 states , even if they are broad . indeed , without these states , the first @xmath171 of @xmath146li does not exist at the level of pole approximation and as a consequence is impossible to find .",

    "the continuum effects are very important in these nuclei , both in their ground states and in excited states .",
    "the nucleus @xmath3li is also a well - known example of a two - neutron halo . in our @xmath177-space(s ) calculation , we consider the one - body coulomb potential of the @xmath178he core , which is given by a uniformly charged sphere having the radius of the ws potential .",
    "it turns out that the inclusion of the one - body coulomb potential modifies the ghf basis in lithium isotopes as compared to the helium isotopes , an effect which is usually neglected in the standard sm calculations .",
    "recent studies of the binding energy systematics in the @xmath179-shell nuclei using the shell model embedded in the continuum ( smec ) @xcite have reported a significant reduction of the neutron - proton @xmath4=0 interaction with respect to the neutron - neutron @xmath4=1 interaction in the nuclei close to the neutron drip line @xcite . in smec , this reduction is associated with a decrease in the one - neutron emission threshold when approaching the neutron drip line , i.e. , it is a genuine continuum coupling effect .",
    "the detailed studies in fluorine isotopes have shown that the reduction of the @xmath4=0 neutron - proton interaction _ can not _ be corrected by any adjustment of the monopole components of the effective hamiltonian . to account for this effect in the standard sm , one would need to introduce a particle - number - dependence of the @xmath4=0 monopole terms .",
    "interestingly , it has recently been suggested @xcite that a linear reduction of @xmath4=0 two - body monopole terms is expected if one incorporates three - body interactions into the two - body framework of a standard sm .",
    "our gsm studies of lithium isotopes indicate that the reduction of @xmath4=0 neutron - proton interaction with increasing neutron number is essential .",
    "for example , if one uses the @xmath180 strength adjusted to @xmath181li to calculate @xmath182li , the g.s .",
    "of @xmath182li becomes overbound by 13 mev , and the situation becomes even worse for heavier li isotopes . to reduce this disastrous tendency , in the first approximation",

    "this linear dependence is probably oversimplified , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite where the proton - neutron @xmath4=0 interaction first decreases fast with increasing neutron number and then saturates for weakly bound systems near the neutron drip line . for the @xmath4=1 interaction ,",
    "we have taken parameters @xmath190 and @xmath191 determined for the he ground states @xcite , as they provide reasonable results in the he chain .",

    "energies of lithium isotopes relative to the g.s .",
    "energy of @xmath178he , but excited states are reproduced roughly . clearly , the particle - number dependence of the matrix elements has to be further investigated in order to achieve the detailed description of the data .",
    "the absence of an anti - bound @xmath161 state in the berggren basis is also likely responsible for large deviations with the data seen for @xmath144li and @xmath3li .    in a number of cases ,",
    "excited gsm states are calculated to lie above several decay thresholds , i.e. , they are predicted to be unstable to , single - nucleon , deutron , proton+neutron emission , and/or @xmath119 decay .",
    "the total decay width of a nucleus in a given gsm eigenstate is given by an imaginary part of its complex eigenenergy .",
    "different open decay channels contribute incoherently to the total decay width and their respective partial width can not be separated easily @xcite . in practical applications ,",
    "however , one may calculate the spectroscopic factors for the separation of nucleon(s ) or nucleon groups in a given gsm eigenstate , following the well - known procedures of the standard shell model @xcite , i.e. , by calculating the probability to find a certain one- or many - particle configuration formed by @xmath192 and @xmath0 nucleons in a state of the @xmath193-nucleon system .",
    "we intend to implement this option in the future .    due to the explicit presence of the coulomb potential in the gsm ,",
    "isospin is no longer conserved .",
    "in order to assess the isospin - mixing effect , for each shell model state @xmath194 we define the average isospin quantum number @xmath195 in the following way : @xmath196 where the isospin raising and lowering operators in @xmath197 act on single - proton and single - neutron states with explicitly _ different _ asymptotic behavior .",
    "as seen in table  [ isospin_table ] , the values of @xmath195 indicate very small isospin - mixing effects . the imaginary part for 2@xmath198 of @xmath146li and 3/2@xmath199 of @xmath145li comes from the fact these states are unbound .",
    "this result demonstrates that despite the presence of the coulomb potential and despite a large coupling to the continuum in some cases , the isospin quantum number is still almost nearly conserved .",
    "that is , isospin is a very good characteristic of nuclear states , even if they are unbound , such as the second @xmath167 state of @xmath145li ( which is a @xmath4=3/2 isobaric analogue of the @xmath145he ground state ) or the lowest @xmath4=1 , @xmath166=2@xmath198 state of @xmath146li ( which can be viewed as a @xmath4=1 isobaric analogue of the first excited state of @xmath146he ) .",
    "the identification of states can be problematic when the eigenstates have same angular momenta and parities .",
    "when their isospin is different , the calculation of the approximate isospin quantum number is useful to identify one state with its experimental counterpart , as was done with the two @xmath200 states of @xmath146li .",
    "for the two @xmath172 of @xmath145li , which have both @xmath201 experimentally , the consideration of their width can be used instead to identify them .",
    "indeed , one of them is broad with a width of 880 kev , while the other is narrower with a width of 89 kev . as one @xmath172 state has to occupy @xmath154 broad resonant states at the level of pole approximation",
    "while the other does not , the latter state can be associated with the @xmath172 with a width of 89 kev , while the former can be associated with the @xmath172 with a width of 880 kev .",
    "the gamow shell model , which has been introduced only very recently @xcite , has proven to be a reliable tool for the microscopic description of weakly bound and unbound nuclear states . in the he isotopes ,",
    "gsm , with either sdi or sgi interactions , was able to describe fairly well binding energy patterns and low - energy spectroscopy , in particular the borromean features in the chain @xmath202he @xcite . using the finite - range sgi interaction made it possible to perform calculations in the ghf basis , thus designing the optimal berggren basis for each nucleus .    in the li isotopes ,",
    "the results crucially depend on the @xmath4=0 interaction channel .",
    "it was found that the @xmath4=0 force should contain a pronounced density ( particle - number ) dependence which originates from the coupling to the continuum and leads to an effective renormalization of the neutron - proton coupling .",
    "this effect can not be absorbed by the modification of @xmath4=0 monopole terms in the standard sm framework .",
    "the effective renormalization of ( @xmath203 ) and ( @xmath204 ) couplings , and , to a lesser extent , other coupling constants found in the present gsm studies has to be further investigated . to better take into account all these effects , calculations with a finite - range , density - dependent interaction inspired by the gogny force @xcite are now in progress .",
    "the three main problems related to the realistic gsm calculations are the treatment of the center of mass ( essential , especially in the context of halo nuclei ) , the inclusion of anti - bound states @xcite , and the handling of very large shell - model spaces .    for that matter , the successful application of gsm to heavier nuclei",
    "is ultimately related to the progress in optimization of the gsm basis , related to the inclusion of the non - resonant continuum configurations .",
    "a promising development is the adaptation of the density matrix renormalization group method @xcite to the genuinely non - hermitian sm problem in the complex-@xmath0 plane using the @xmath130-scheme @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "in this paper we report the proof - of - principle proton - neutron calculations using the gamow shell model .",
    "our single - particle proton hamiltonian contains the coulomb term that explicitly breaks isospin symmetry . in order to extend gsm calculations to open - proton systems ,",
