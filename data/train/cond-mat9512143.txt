    "however , by using direct ed techniques it is necessary to truncate the phononic hilbert space , and hence the accessible parameter space is limited by the size of the matrix one can diagonalize .",

    "although the adiabatic and antiadiabatic as well as the weak and strong  coupling limiting cases are well reproduced in this approach , the situation becomes less favourable at intermediate ep couplings and phonon frequencies and , in particular , in the crossover region from large  size nearly free polarons ( fp ) to small  size ` quasi  localized ' polarons ( i.e. , in the vicinity of the so  called ` self  trapping ' transition ) .",

    "it is more effective to exploit the point group symmetries of the original basis  ( [ gsta ] )",
    ".    then the resulting hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized using a standard lanczos method .",
    "as the convergence of the lanczos procedure depends on the ( relative ) difference of neighbouring eigenvalues , @xmath45 , one needs to be very careful in resolving eigenvalues within the extremely narrow small  polaron band . to monitor the convergence of our truncation procedure as a function of @xmath40",

    "in addition , we check that @xmath51 is smaller than the estimate obtained from the imvlf  lanczos treatment of the phonon subsystem  @xcite .    we have written the program in fortran90 and ran it on a 64node cm5 .",
    "we were able to diagonalize hamiltonian matrices up to a total dimension ( @xmath54 ) of about 82 millions .",
    "since a matrix vector multiplication for this matrix size takes less than 150 seconds , the limiting factor of our numerical algorithm is the available storage .",
    "in the first place , we investigate the polaron properties of the holstein model with a single electron on finite lattices with up to ten sites using periodic boundary conditions . in the light of the literature over at least the last two decades  @xcite we expect a gradual transition from a ( nearly free ) large  polaron solution to a small  polaron  like ground state upon increasing the ep coupling .",
    "since , in particular in the adiabatic regime , the formation of a polaronic state is accompanied by a strong reduction of the coherent electron motion , this effect should be observable in the expectation value of the kinetic energy @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the ground  state wave - function .",
    "we therefore define an effective polaronic transfer amplitude  @xcite , @xmath57 in order to characterize the increase in the quasiparticle mass  @xcite .",

    "the phonons are able to follow immediately the electronic motion forming a non ",

    "firsov polaron ( nlfp ) , one observes a very gradual decrease of @xmath58 as @xmath22 increases . at the same time",
    "the ` phonon distribution function ' , @xmath52 , gets wider but the maximum is still located at the zero  phonon state . in the adiabatic regime ,",
    "one notices a crossover from a large  size polaron ( lp ) in 1d or nearly free polaron ( fp ) in 2d , described by a @xmath58 that is only weakly reduced from its noninteracting value , to a less mobile ( small  size ) adiabatic holstein polaron ( ahp ) for large @xmath22 .",
    "we point out that the nature of ` delocalized ' polaronic states , occurring in the weak  coupling region , is different in 1d and 2d  @xcite . in the 1d case ,",
    "the fp state becomes unstable at any finite ep coupling .",
    "as expected the transition to the ahp state occurs if the ep coupling approximately exceeds half the bare electronic bandwidth and , in accordance with monte carlo results  @xcite , is much sharper in two dimensions  @xcite ( in the remainder of this section we focus on the 1d case ) .",
    "nonetheless , all physical quantities are smooth functions of @xmath22 , in particular there are no ground  state level crossings , i.e. , the transition from lp / fp to ahp is _ continuous _ and not accompanied by any non  analyticities . while in the weak",

    "these results confirm previous findings for the holstein hubbard model on very small size clusters ( with two or three sites ) , where , as @xmath22 increases in the adiabatic regime , a strong increase of the average number of phonons , @xmath71 , contained in the ground state , was observed ( cf . tab .",

    "the phonon expectation value in the polaronic ground state may be derived from the phonon distribution function @xmath52 by @xmath72 .    to elucidate the difference between the ` extended ' lp and ` quasi  localized ' ahp states in more detail ,",
    "we have calculated the electron  phonon density correlation function @xmath73 which measures the correlation between the electron occupying site @xmath10 and the density of phonons on site @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "results for @xmath75 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] at @xmath63 for all distances @xmath76 , show that for small @xmath22 the correlation between the electron and the phonons is pretty weak and exhibits little structure , i.e. , the few phonons contained in the ground state are nearly uniformly distributed over the whole lattice .",
    "in contrast , in the case of large ep coupling ( @xmath77 ) , the phonons are strongly correlated with the position of the electron , thus implying a very small radius of the polaron .",
    "note , however , that the translational invariance of the ground state is not broken .",
    "since a polaron s mass is inversely proportional to its size , the ahp formed at large @xmath22 is an extremely heavy quasiparticle . as can be seen from the inset of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , the on  site electron ",
    "phonon correlation increases dramatically around the same value of @xmath22 at which @xmath58 becomes depressed ( cf .",

    "dispersion ' of noninteracting electrons is most pronounced at _ intermediate _ phonon frequencies @xmath87 , i.e. , in between the extreme adiabatic ( ahp ) and antiadiabatic ( nlfp ) limits .",
    "this deviation may be due to a residual polaron ",
    "phonon interaction , with the phonons sitting on sites other than the polaron . to demonstrate that the low  lying eigenvalues do indeed form a well  separated quasiparticle band in the adiabatic strong  coupling regime ( @xmath77 , @xmath63 ) , in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we have displayed the lowest few eigenvalues in dependence on @xmath22 . in the very weak  coupling regime ( @xmath88 )",
    "the eigenvalues are barely changed from their @xmath89 values , where additional eigenvalues , separated from the ground  state energy @xmath51 by multiples of @xmath90 ( e.g. ,",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 ) , enter the spectrum .",
    "as @xmath22 increases a band of states separates from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "these states become very close in energy and a narrow well  separated energy band evolves in the strong  coupling case ( @xmath77 ) . obviously",
    ", the gap to the next higher band of eigenvalues is of the order of the bare phonon frequency @xmath90 .",
    "neglecting degeneracies one may tentatively identify those five states as the states of the small  polaron band on the eight  site lattice .    keeping this identification in mind , in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] we have plotted the lowest eigenvalues as a function of the ( 1d ) @xmath94vectors belonging to various system sizes ( @xmath95 , 8 , 10 ) .",
    "one notices that the dispersion @xmath96 is rather size independent , i.e. , the @xmath96 values obtained for larger systems just fill the gaps .",
    "undoubtedly , the smooth shape of @xmath96 already provides good reasons for a quasiparticle band description of the ahp in the strong  coupling regime . to further substantiate this quasiparticle interpretation",

    "equivalent @xmath94values of the six  site system using a polynomial moment method  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to see a direct verification of the coherent band dispersion @xmath96 in terms of @xmath99 .",
    "the electronic spectral functions @xmath99 are shown in the four insets of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] . the important point",
    ", we would like to emphasize , is that the position of the first peak in each spectral function @xmath99 exactly coincides with the corresponding @xmath96value and the other peaks are at higher energies than any of the coherent band  energy values .",
    "this means , our exact results for the low  energy excitation spectrum of a single electron corroborate the existence of heavily dressed polaronic quasiparticles , where the electronic and phononic degrees of freedom are strongly mixed .",
    "of course , in the very high  energy regime the results for @xmath99 can not be trusted just due to the errors induced by the necessary truncation of the phononic hilbert space .",
    "next , we wish to discuss the two  electron problem . here",
    "it is of special interest to understand in detail the conditions under which the two electrons form a bipolaron .",
    "whether or not a transition to a bipolaronic state will occur depends sensitively on the competition between the short  ranged phonon  mediated , i.e. , retarded @xmath100 , attraction @xmath101 and the instantaneous on  site hubbard repulsion @xmath102 .",

    "[ f6 ] ( a ) shows the strong ( gradual ) reduction of the effective _ polaronic _ transfer amplitude @xmath58 as @xmath22 increases in the adiabatic ( non  adiabatic ) regime . now let us mainly focus on the physically more interesting regime of ` small ' phonon frequencies , @xmath63 .",
    "in the case of vanishing coulomb interaction @xmath103 any finite ep interaction causes an effective on  site attraction between the electrons forming a bipolaronic bound state ( remember , e.g. , that @xmath104 follows from the simple lang ",
    "firsov approach ) .",
    "this means , in the pure holstein model the state with two nearly free ( large ) polarons does not exist , at least in one spatial dimension  @xcite . in the weak  coupling limit , the two  polaron state can , however , be stabilized by taking into account the on  site coulomb repulsion . in this case , a crossover from a state of two mobile large polarons to an extended bipolaronic state occurs .",
    "the ` transition ' will be shifted to larger ep couplings as @xmath18 increases ( see fig .  [ f6 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath105 and @xmath63 ( 3.0 ) , we find that the binding energy of two electrons , @xmath106 , becomes negative at about @xmath107 ( 2.8 ) .",
    "further justification for this interpretation can be found from the behaviour of the effective bipolaronic transfer amplitude  @xcite , @xmath108 with @xmath109 shown in fig .  [ f6 ]  ( b ) .",
    "@xmath110 describes the coherent hopping of a on  site bipolaron from site @xmath10 to site @xmath74 .",
    "contrary to @xmath58 , at low ep coupling strengths , the bipolaronic hopping amplitude @xmath110 _ grows _ with increasing @xmath22 showing the increasing importance of the correlated motion of two electrons ( but , quite clearly , we have @xmath111 ) . at large ep couplings ( e.g. , for @xmath112 at @xmath103 and @xmath63 ) ,",
    "the on  site bipolaron becomes more and more localized and accordingly we observe a drop in @xmath110 which corresponds to the drop in @xmath58 in the case of one electron at the parameter values where the ahp becomes stable .",
    "hence we will call this quasiparticle an adiabatic holstein bipolaron ( ahbp ) .    to better illustrate the effect of pair formation in the 1d holstein ( hubbard ) model , we present in fig .",

    "site correlations @xmath117 with @xmath118 , in particular for @xmath119 , i.e. , in the ahbp regime where both electrons are mainly confined to the same site sharing a common lattice distortion .",
    "therefore the transition from a mobile large bipolaron to a ` quasi  self  trapped ' on  site ahbp is manifest in a strongly enhanced @xmath120 as well ( see inset ) .",
    "moreover , the transition should be associated with a significant reduction of the local magnetic moment , @xmath121 , indicating the local pairing of spin up and down electrons .",
    "indeed we found @xmath122 .",

    "[ f7 ]  ( b ) , a somewhat different scenario emerges in the presence of a finite coulomb interaction . here",
    ", the hubbard repulsion prevents the formation of an on  site bipolaronic bound state in the weak ep coupling regime . on the other hand ,",
    "as recently pointed out by marsiglio  @xcite , the retardation effect of the ep interaction may favour the formation of more extended pairs .",
    "that is , due to the time  delay the second electron can take the advantage of the lattice distortion left by the first one still avoiding the direct coulomb repulsion .",
    "in fact , increasing the ep interaction , we find that both the nearest  neighbour electron  electron and electron  phonon density correlations starts to rise , while the on  site correlations remain small ( cf .",
    "[ f7 ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "consequently , we may label this state an adiabatic inter ",
    "site bipolaron .",
    "we expect that at larger values of @xmath22 the short  range ep interaction overcomes the hubbard repulsion and as a result the two electrons coalesce on a single site forming a ` self  trapped ' bipolaron .",
    "unfortunately we are unable to increase the dimension of the hilbert space to contain a large enough number of phonons in the adiabatic very strong  coupling regime .",
    "as already mentioned for the one  electron case , the description of the self  trapping phenomenon requires the inclusion of multi  phonon states .",

    "although we do not have a clear definition as to the momentum of this compound particle , it turns out that we indeed find a well  separated energy band if we again classify the lowest energy eigenvalues with respect to the allowed @xmath94states of our finite system ( see fig .",

    "firsov polaron theory the effective coulomb interaction vanishes .",

    ".      now let us turn to the case , where a few dopant  induced charge carriers ( holes ) coupled to lattice phonons move in an antiferromagnetic correlated spin background .",
    "in 2d , this situation , frequently described by the holstein t  j model  ( [ htjm ] )  @xcite , is particularly interesting as it represents the basic electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the @xmath131 planes of the high@xmath1 cuprates .",
    "as yet , very little is known theoretically about the interplay between ep coupling and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in such systems .",

    "there is , however , an important difference between the one  hole and one  electron cases which should not be underemphasized : in the single  hole holstein t  j model antiferromagnetic spin correlations and ep interactions reinforce each other to the effect of _ lowering _ the threshold for polaronic ` self  localization ' .",

    "[ f12 ] we show the effective polaronic transfer amplitudes @xmath142 _ vs _ ep coupling strength in the adiabatic ( @xmath143 ) , intermediate ( @xmath134 ) , and non  adiabatic ( @xmath144 ) regimes . in each case",

    "remarkably we find that @xmath145 is larger than @xmath146 for @xmath147 and @xmath143 , indicating a _ dynamical _ type of hole binding in the low  frequency weak  coupling regime where retardation effects become important . indeed ,",
    "the two  hole binding energy , defined as usual by @xmath148 with respect to the heisenberg energy @xmath149 , slightly decreases , i.e. , hole binding is enhanced [ @xmath150 , as the ep interaction increases at low ep coupling strengths .",
    "in contrast , at large phonon frequencies , with increasing @xmath22 we find that @xmath151 increases , which seems to be an indication that retardation no longer plays a role  @xcite . on the other hand , in the adiabatic strong  coupling regime , where the two holes become `",

    "hole density correlation function @xmath152 in the 2d holstein t  j model .",
    "note that @xmath153 provides an even more reliable test for the occurrence of hole binding than the binding energy @xmath151",
    "@xcite . indeed , when calculating @xmath151 , we are comparing states with different quantum numbers , specifically with different @xmath154 and @xmath155 . in fig .",
    "[ f13 ] we present results for the non  equivalent hole ",
    "hole pair correlation functions in the ground state of the holstein t  j model with two holes . in the weak  coupling region",
    "the hole  density correlation function becomes maximum at the largest distance of the ten ",
    "site lattice , while in the intermediate ep coupling regime the preference is on nnn pairs . as expected ,",
    "increasing further the ep interaction strength , the maximum in @xmath153 is shifted to the shortest possible distance ( remember that double occupancy is strictly forbidden ) , indicating hole ",
    "hole attraction .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath153 is found to be qualitatively similar for higher ( lower ) phonon frequencies ( see inset ) , except that the crossings of different hole ",
    "hole correlation functions occur at larger ( smaller ) values of @xmath22 .",
    "in essence , our results clearly indicate that hole  bipolarons could be formed in the holstein t  j model at large ep coupling .",
    "to summarize , in this paper we have studied the problem of ( hole ) bi/polaron formation in the holstein hubbard / t  j model by means of direct lanczos diagonalization using a truncation method of the phononic hilbert space .",
    "compared with previous treatments of the holstein ( hubbard ) model on very small clusters , we are able to analyze large enough systems in order to discuss polaron and bipolaron band formation , which has been a subject of recent controversy  @xcite .",
    "our main results are the following .",
    "* in the case of a single electron coupled to einstein phonons ( holstein model ) , we confirm that the rather ` sharp ' transition from a ` delocalized ' nearly free polaron ( fp ) [ or a large polaron ( lp ) in 1d ] to a ` quasi ",
    "localized ' holstein polaron ( ahp ) in the adiabatic regime and the very smooth transition to a lang  firsov ",
    "type polaron ( nlfp ) in the non  adiabatic regime are both _",
    "continuous_. in agreement with recent exact results  @xcite , we observe no ground  state level crossings or any non  analyticities as the ep coupling increases .",
    "we point out that in the one  dimensional weak  coupling case a large  size polaron is formed at any finite ep coupling . in the strong  coupling regime ,",
    "the ahp state is characterized by pronounced on  site electron ",
    "phonon correlations making the quasiparticle susceptible to ` self  trapping ' .",
    "most notably , the formation of an adiabatic holstein polaron is accompanied by a shift of the maximum in the phonon distribution function to higher phonon states , which seems to be an intrinsic feature of the ` self  trapping ' transition . by contrast , the non ",
    "adiabatic nlfp ground state is basically a zero  phonon state .",
    "* by calculating the spectral properties of a single electron , we have found convincing evidence for the formation of a well separated narrow polaron band in both the adiabatic and non ",
    "adiabatic strong  coupling regimes .",
    "in addition to the expected band  narrowing we also found a deviation from the ` cosine'-dispersion away from the adiabatic and antiadiabatic limits .",
    "although the ` coherent ' bandwidth , deduced from our finite  lattice ed data , becomes extremely small in the adiabatic strong  coupling case ( polaronic band collapse ) , we believe that the ahp does not lose its phase coherence and can move itinerantly . *",
    "investigating the two  particle problem in terms of the 1d holstein model , we could clearly identify the transition from a extended ( large ) bipolaron to a ` quasi  localized ' ( on  site ) bipolaron ( ahbp ) as the ep interaction strength increases .",
    "stabilizing a two  polaron state in the weak ep coupling regime by taking into account the on - site coulomb repulsion ( holstein hubbard model ) , we found a transition to an inter - site bipolaron at about @xmath156 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that this inter - site bipolaron appears to have a dispersion that resembles very closely the cosine  dispersion of a noninteracting particle with a renormalized bandwidth . if the ep coupling is further enhanced @xmath157 , a second transition to a ` self ",
    "trapped ' on  site ahbp will occur  @xcite .",
    "* analyzing the hole ",
    "polaron formation in the framework of the 2d holstein t  j model",
    ", we found that the critical ep coupling for the polaron transition is substantially reduced due to ` prelocalization ' of the doped charge carriers in the antiferromagnetic spin background .",
    "therefore we suggest that polaronic effects are of special importance in ( low  dimensional ) strongly correlated narrow ",
    "band systems like the nickelates and high@xmath1 cuprates . * regarding ground  state properties of the holstein t  j model in the two  hole sector , a detailed study of the hole  hole correlation functions and the two  hole binding energy was carried out , yielding strong evidence for an enhanced hole attraction and the formation of hole ",
    "bipolarons as a dynamical effect of the ep interaction .",
    "of course , the exact results presented in this paper hold for the holstein hubbard ( holstein t  j ) model with one and two electrons ( holes ) on _ finite _ 1d ( 2d ) systems , i.e. , we are not prepared to prove any _ rigorous _ statements about the thermodynamic limit here .",
    "however , we believe that our main conclusions ( i)(v ) , in particular the existence of well  separated polaronic and bipolaronic quasiparticle bands even in the adiabatic strong  coupling regime , will survive in the infinite system .",
    "the computations were performed on a cm5 of the gmd ( st . austin ) .",
