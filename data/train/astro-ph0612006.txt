    "the existence of attractor solutions to the inflationary equations of motion make obtaining information about the pre - inflationary universe virtually impossible if inflation continues for long enough .",
    "implementations of inflation in string theory ( _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) generically suffer from the `` @xmath3 problem '' , which means they must be fine - tuned to achieve sufficient inflation .",
    "it is therefore well - motivated from the point of view of string theory to consider models with a minimal number of e - folds .",
    "if inflation lasts just long enough to solve the horizon and flatness problems , it is quite possible that pre - inflationary cosmology will leave imprints on the present day universe .",
    "in particular , pre - inflationary physics can lead to modulations in the primordial power spectrum , which may be observed in the large - scale temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .    during inflation ,",
    "cosmological perturbations had their start as tiny vacuum fluctuations which were then redshifted to super - horizon scales by the rapidly expanding spacetime .",
    "perturbations on the scale of the present - day universe left the inflationary horizon at around @xmath2 , having originated as small - scale vacuum fluctuations at some earlier time . in order to fully reconstruct the primordial spectrum generated by inflation",
    ", we must be able to understand the evolution of quantum modes from their birth in the inflationary vacuum out to the extreme large - scale limit .",
    "if inflation lasts for many more than 60 efolds , which is commonly assumed , then the inflationary model fully specifies the evolution on all observable scales .",
    "however , if inflation lasts for just the minimum number of e - foldings , then the initial conditions of the quantum fluctuations must be set in the pre - inflationary era .",
    "information about this earlier time is therefore required to uniquely calculate the inflationary power spectrum .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effects of a prior period of radiation - dominated expansion on the subsequent inflationary epoch in models which yield the minimum amount of inflation , which we take to be @xmath4 for definiteness .",
    "in such a circumstance , the initial quantum modes are born not in the inflationary vacuum , but in the vacuum appropriate to radiation - dominated expansion .",
    "this has a profound effect on the largest - scale perturbations .",
    "the standard calculation of perturbations in inflation assumes a well - defined short - wavelength limit for quantum modes .",
    "however , a fluctuation that leaves the horizon at the very start of inflation would need to have ` started out ' large , since no non - inflationary mechanism could have brought it to such scales .",
    "therefore , when we set initial conditions for the fluctuations at the start of inflation , we are forced to consider quantum fluctuations far from the short - wavelength limit .",
    "as we show , fluctuations that are born at large wavelength during the radiation - dominated era affect the power spectrum very differently than fluctuations born at small wavelength during the inflationary era , resulting in a strong suppression of power on large scales .",
    "the transition from a radiation - dominated phase to a de sitter universe was first studied by vilenkin and ford @xcite , starobinsky @xcite , and by linde @xcite , and the production of gravity waves during such a transition has been studied by sahni @xcite .",
    "these earlier works concentrated on the impact of thermal effects on the stability of the de sitter phase transition .",
    "in contrast , we consider the case of a decoupled scalar field and assume an instantaneous phase transition .",
    "not only does this simplify the analysis , but it elucidates the profound effect that the choice of vacuum alone has on the primordial power spectrum .",
    "we emphasize the role of the choice of vacuum in the modulation of the power spectrum , as opposed to the pre - inflationary dynamics of the inflaton field itself , as considered by previous authors @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section i we review the standard treatment of inflationary fluctuations in de sitter space . in section ii we study the evolution of both inflaton fluctuations and curvature perturbations in the pre - inflationary radiation - dominated universe .",
    "we find that if the inflaton is slowly rolling then the two effectively decouple , allowing us to treat the inflaton as a massless scalar during radiation domination .",
    "this allows us to construct an adiabatic vacuum that is exact at all wavelengths . in section iii",
    ", we calculate the modification to the best - fit wmap3 power spectrum when we initialize the quantum modes in this vacuum .",

    "this is to be expected , since at such small length scales the quantum modes do not feel the expansion of the universe .",

    "the resulting power spectrum is shown to lower the @xmath155 s of the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies at low @xmath156 , particularly around the quadrupole .",
    "we find a spread in likelihoods of @xmath161 in models for which at most 1 e - fold of inflation occurs between the onset of inflation and the time that scales corresponding to the quadrupole leave the horizon , as compared to the best - fit wmap model with no tensors and no running .",
    "we find an improvement of only @xmath162 for models with @xmath163 , so current data does not strongly favor such models . since the modifications to the @xmath155-spectra occur at the cosmic variance dominated low-@xmath156 multipoles , a more accurate measurement of the more sensitive te spectrum will be necessary to decisively detect this effect .",
    "hirai and takami @xcite apply a methodology very similar to that presented here to investigate the effect of pre - inflationary physics , including that from a prior radiation - dominated phase .",
    "however , instead of considering a modification to the boundary condition of the quantum scalar mode @xmath164 , they use a boundary condition appropriate to a hydrodynamical radiation - dominated mode , with @xmath165 .",
    "this results in the apparently unphysical conclusion that modulations to the inflationary power spectrum persist at all scales , regardless of the duration of inflation .",
    "however , we argue that the dominant contribution to the post - inflationary curvature perturbation will be from those generated by fluctuations in the inflaton field itself , for which @xmath166 even in the pre - inflationary phase .    finally , we draw attention to previous work on this subject , namely @xcite and @xcite , who consider a pre - inflationary fast - rolling phase and matter dominated phase , respectively . while the details of the pre - inflationary phase differ amongst these models , the effect on the primordial power spectrum is strikingly similar . however , nicholson _",
    "@xcite showed recently that models for which there is a transition from an initial fast - rolling stage to the slow - roll attractor have a relatively large gravitational wave contribution on large scales , in contrast to models preceded by radiation or matter - dominated expansion .",
    "our analysis differs further in that the suppression of power on large scales is manifestly the result of a choice of vacuum .",
    "the details of the background dynamics do not enter into the calculation , except to specify the vacuum state in the pre - inflationary phase .",
    "the similarity of the modifications to the power spectrum suggests the conclusion that the effect of pre - inflationary physics can be generically considered as an effect of vacuum definition , in a fashion similar to to that for trans - planckian modulations @xcite .",
    "( this issue was considered in an effective field theory context in ref .",
    "however , in all cases the resulting modification to the spectrum of fluctuations in the cmb results in only a modest improvement of the fit to the data .",
    "since the observational uncertainties at these scales are dominated by cosmic variance , evidence for these effects is likely to remain inconclusive in the absence of additional observable evidence .",
