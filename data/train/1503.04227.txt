    ", we can transform equations ( [ geneqn1 ] ) , ( [ geneqn2 ] ) and ( [ geneqn3 ] ) as follows .",
    "note that for @xmath228 , the set of indices @xmath229 cycle through all of the values @xmath230 a total of @xmath222 times , except one of them , namely @xmath231 , which appears @xmath232 times",
    ". then we can rewrite ( [ geneqn3 ] ) as @xmath233 i.e. @xmath234    observe that in the above equation , @xmath222 s are periodic with a period @xmath93 whereas the @xmath155 s are well defined modulo @xmath80 ( since @xmath235 s have period @xmath80 ) , which is usually much bigger than @xmath93 .",
    "then for the purpose of finding an @xmath135 which satisfies the system of equations ( [ geneqn1 ] ) , ( [ geneqn2 ] ) and ( [ geneqn3 ] ) , it will be enough to consider the indices @xmath118 for which @xmath222 is maximum for the same value of @xmath155 .    to make the statement more precise",
    ", we introduce the following notation . let the set of indices @xmath236 be defined by @xmath237 then the first thing to note is that the set of numbers @xmath238 are all distinct .",
    "next recall that we are in fact trying to find the fringe length , which is @xmath239 , where @xmath26 is the solution to the stairstep algorithm .",
    "so with a simple change of variable , our algorithm becomes the following _ linear programming problem _ : @xmath240    but since we are trying to find the maximum , we may as well assume that @xmath241 and @xmath242 if @xmath243 for some @xmath244 .",
    "then by a theorem of kaplan@xcite , we get that the optimal solution occurs when for all @xmath244 , the number @xmath245 equals some constant @xmath246 independent of @xmath118 .",
    "to find @xmath246 , observe that @xmath247 thus the optimal solution to the linear programming problem , which is also the required fringe length is given by @xmath248 so all that remains is to figure out what the set of indices @xmath236 looks like . in the rest of this section",
    "we try to characterize @xmath236 and prove the fringe formula [ theorem : fringe_formula ] .",
    "it is clear from the definition that to figure out the set @xmath236 , we need to find out exactly when two of the @xmath155 s are equal as @xmath118 ranges from @xmath27 to @xmath249 .",
    "recall that the indices @xmath155 are taken modulo @xmath80 . using the optimal partition",
    ", we get that @xmath250 and hence @xmath251 since @xmath252 .",
    "thus the elements of @xmath236 are in bijective correspondence with the number of residue classes modulo @xmath80 in the following set of numbers : @xmath253 so we can rewrite the formula for the set @xmath236 as @xmath254 note that @xmath255 and @xmath191 s are periodic with period @xmath93 .",
    "so we have , @xmath256 or in other words , the collection of numbers @xmath257 is nothing but a union of disjoint translates of the collection @xmath258 by @xmath259 .",
    "let us refer to the @xmath93-tuple @xmath258 as the first  @xmath93-block \" .",
    "similarly the @xmath84-translate of the first @xmath93-block is referred to as the second @xmath93-block and so on .",
    "note that @xmath260 , so the @xmath261-translate of the first @xmath93-block is identical to itself modulo @xmath80 .",
    "hence we may think of translation by @xmath262 as translation by @xmath263 .",
    "next we claim that    the numbers @xmath259 are all distinct modulo @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath80 divides the difference between any two such numbers , say @xmath264 , then @xmath265 , which is a contradiction .",
    "in fact since @xmath266 is invertible modulo @xmath80 , the set of numbers @xmath267 is the same as @xmath268 modulo @xmath80 .",
    "thus to determine the congruence classes in the collection @xmath257 , it is enough to find out which @xmath93-blocks overlap with the first @xmath269block . note that translating an @xmath269block by @xmath270 takes it off itself entirely , so the _ only _ translates of an @xmath93-block that could overlap with itself are the translates by @xmath271 for @xmath272 ( see figure [ fig : n - blocks ] ) .    finally observe that if we start with the the @xmath93-block given by @xmath273 instead , we get overlaps at the same multiple of @xmath207 as the first @xmath93-block ; only translated by @xmath207 .",
    "thus starting from @xmath274 , if we divide the residue class of @xmath80 into a total of @xmath275 number of @xmath276sized groups , then each @xmath222 s appears same no .",
    "of times in each group and the overlaps appear at the same places translated by multiples of @xmath207 . hence to calculate the sum of @xmath277 over all residue classes , it is enough to calculate it for",
    "the residue classes which appear among @xmath278 up to @xmath279 and then multiply the result by @xmath275 .",
    "let us summarize the results we have found so far in the form of an algorithm .    1 .",
    "write down @xmath280 where @xmath281 .",
    "2 .   for each @xmath282 , let @xmath283 be defined as follows : @xmath284 note that in case @xmath285 , we replace @xmath266 with @xmath275 in above definition .",
    "3 .   let @xmath31 be the sum of @xmath283 s for @xmath282 .",
    "then the fringe length is given by @xmath286    to finish the proof , define @xmath287 and note that by the structure of the algorithm , @xmath21 depends only on @xmath288 and the word @xmath4 . as a corollary",
    ", we also get the remarkable consequence that    the fringe length _ does not _",
    "depend on @xmath86 .",
    "i.e. the fringes are `` periodic '' on every scale . in section   [ section : projective_self_similarity ]",
    "we elaborate on this phenomenon in a particular example , and discuss possible generalizations .",
    "in this section we give some examples to illustrate the complexity of the function @xmath289 in general , and in the special case that @xmath8 is prime .",
    "let us first prove that    [ theorem : sigma_inequality ] suppose @xmath81 .",
    "then the function @xmath21 satisfies the inequality @xmath290 where the first equality is achieved in the case when @xmath84 divides @xmath80 and the second equality occurs when @xmath291 .    for the first inequality , recall the numbers @xmath292 from last section .",
    "note that the fact that @xmath293 tells us that there are at most @xmath266 elements in each residue class modulo @xmath80 among @xmath294 .",
    "thus @xmath295 on the other hand , adding all the @xmath249 inequalities in ( [ geneqn3 ] ) , and using @xmath228 , we get that @xmath296 @xmath297 hence , for the minimal @xmath135 giving the fringe length we get that @xmath298    for the second inequality , observe that by definition , @xmath299 since number of elements in @xmath236 is at most the number of residue classes modulo @xmath80 .",
    "hence @xmath300 we will finish the proof by showing that equality is indeed achieved in the following special cases :      in this case @xmath302 .",
    "hence all the @xmath155 s are distinct .",
    "consider the specific example where @xmath303 for all @xmath118 and the rest of the @xmath235 s are zero .",
    "then we have @xmath304 thus the minimum @xmath305 which gives a solution to ( [ geneqn1 ] ) , ( [ geneqn2 ] ) , ( [ geneqn3 ] ) is @xmath306 thus equality is achieved in the first part of theorem [ theorem : sigma_inequality ] .    we can give a second proof of this same fact using the algorithm developed in last section .",
    "since @xmath307 , the @xmath206 of @xmath84 and @xmath80 is @xmath84 .",
    "so any @xmath276translate of the @xmath93-block is disjoint from itself .",
    "hence @xmath308 , giving the same formula as above .",
    "in this situation , @xmath310 . hence @xmath311 and @xmath312 since @xmath313 .",
    "let @xmath314 as in the proof of theorem [ theorem : stairstep ] . since @xmath4 now has a periodic orbit of period exactly @xmath80 , we get that any @xmath187string starting on adjacent @xmath315s must land in adjacent @xmath316 strings",
    ". thus the constraints of the linear programming problem are invariant under permutation of the variable @xmath235 , and by convexity , extrema is achieved when all @xmath235 s are equal .",
    "but then we get @xmath317 and @xmath318 hence the minimum @xmath135 which gives a solution to the system of equation is given by @xmath319 observing that equality is indeed achieved in case of the word @xmath320 , we get equality in the second part of theorem [ theorem : sigma_inequality ] .    again",
    ", we can give a much simpler proof of this result using the algorithm in the last section .",
    "in this case , we have @xmath310 so that @xmath313 .",
    "so @xmath31 is the maximum of all the @xmath222 s which correspond to any @xmath321 which is a translate of @xmath274 by one of @xmath322 ; i.e. all of the @xmath321 s .",
    "thus @xmath323 since @xmath310 .",
    "[ corollary : sigma_prime ] if @xmath84 is a prime number then @xmath324    the function @xmath21 depends on @xmath325 in a complicated way when @xmath84 is not prime as we can see from the following table :    .values of @xmath21 for different @xmath4 and @xmath207 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ example : abaab_fringe_formula ] let us consider the case of the word @xmath326 . by corollary",
    "[ corollary : sigma_prime ] , the left fringe lengths are given by@xmath327 and the right fringe lengths are given by @xmath328 the cases when @xmath329 and @xmath330 were also discussed in @xcite , p @xmath331 .",
    "we finish this section by giving a fringe plot for both sides for the word @xmath326 .",
    "let us put the origin at the point @xmath332 and the point @xmath333 be depicted as @xmath334 .",
    "then we have the following picture .",
    "in her paper @xcite , a. gordenko shows that the the ziggurat of the word @xmath63 is self similar under two projective transformation ( theorem @xmath218 ) . in this section",
    "we show that similar transformations exist in case of the word @xmath326 , which gives a different way to look at the fringe formula .",
    "let us first look at the self - similarities of the left fringe .",
    "below is a plot of the fringe lengths where @xmath335-axis is the value of @xmath336 and @xmath337axis is value of @xmath338 .",
    "thus for @xmath339 we have @xmath338 defined as in example ( [ example : abaab_fringe_formula ] ) .",
    "we will drop the subscript @xmath340 for the next part .",
    "we prove that the unit interval can be decomposed into some finite number of intervals @xmath341 such that there exist a further decomposition of each @xmath341 into a disjoint union of subintervals @xmath342 such that the graph of @xmath343 on each of @xmath342 is similar to that on some @xmath344 under projective linear transformations as follows :    [ theorem : abaab_self_similarity ] let @xmath345 and @xmath346 .",
    "then we have the following decomposition into @xmath342 and transformations @xmath347 : @xmath348 , \\\\   & & & t_{1 , 1}(x , y)=\\left(\\frac{x}{1 - 3x } , \\frac{y}{1 - 3x}\\right ) \\\\ & i_{1 , 2}=(1/4 , 1/3 ) ,   & t_{1 ,",
