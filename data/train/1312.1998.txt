    "topological properties of condensed matter systems have attracted wide attention in recent years . in particular , localized bound states emerging at the interface between different topological regions",
    "have been studied intensely both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "majorana fermions ( mfs ) , zero - energy bound states with non - abelian braid statistics , were predicted in several systems such as fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) systems,@xcite topological insulators , @xcite optical lattices , @xcite @xmath1-wave superconductors , @xcite nanowires with rashba spin orbit interaction ( soi ) , @xcite self - tuning rkky systems , @xcite and graphene - like systems.@xcite    though mfs possess non - abelian statistics , it is of ising type which is not sufficient for universal quantum computation , in contrast to fibonacci anyons.@xcite the basic building blocks for the latter anyons are parafermions ( pfs ) , also referred to as fractional mfs , which allow for more universal quantum operations than mfs.@xcite similarly to mfs , pfs are bound states that arise at the interface between two distinct topological phases .",
    "in contrast to mfs , however , pfs owe their peculiar properties to strong electron - electron interactions . as a result , most proposals to host pfs invoke edge states of fqhe systems , and to stabilize them at zero energy one relies on particle - hole symmetry generated by proximity to a superconductor .",
    "@xcite however , while strong magnetic fields are required for the fqhe , they are detrimental for superconductivity , making the experimental realization of such proposals challenging . @xcite this has motivated us to search for alternatives to generate pfs with superconductivity but without magnetic fields . indeed",
    ", we will show that by taking advantage of time - reversal invariance it is possible to construct kramers pairs of pfs , which can be considered as generalization of kramers pairs of mfs studied before .",
    "@xcite we are also motivated to work with one - dimensional systems where recent experiments have demonstrated proximity - induced superconductivity of crossed andreev type , @xcite strong electron - electron interaction , @xcite and high tunability of the chemical potential .",
    "@xcite moreover , the class of materials suitable for our scheme is larger than for schemes with magnetic field since we do not require large @xmath2-factors .",

    "the soi field points in positive ( negative ) direction , say , along the @xmath3 azis for the upper ( lower ) qw , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the intrawire proximity induced superconductivity of strength @xmath6 corresponds to a cooper pair ( pair of green dots ) tunneling as a whole into the @xmath7-wire .",
    "the interwire proximity induced superconductivity of strength @xmath8 corresponds to crossed andreev reflection into both qws , which dominates for strong electron - electron interaction assumed here . ]",
    "the setup we consider ( see fig .",
    "[ bundle ] ) consists of two one - dimensional channels , or quantum wires ( qws ) with the rashba soi .",
    "the qws are close to an @xmath0-wave superconductor resulting in proximity induced superconductivity . in general , there are two types of pairing terms .",
    "the first one is intrawire pairing corresponding to tunneling of cooper pairs as a whole to either of the qws .",
    "the second type is the interwire pairing corresponding to ` crossed andreev reflection ' @xcite where the cooper pair gets split into two different channels .",
    "such processes dominate in the regime of strong electron - electron interactions .",
    "@xcite in this case , the system is in the topological phase with bound states localized at the system ends .",
    "if the chemical potential is tuned close to the soi energy , the system supports two mfs at each end that are time - reversal partners of each other .",
    "@xcite more strikingly , if the chemical potential is lowered , _",
    "e.g. _ to one nineth of the soi energy , and electron - electron interactions are strong , the zero - energy ground state contains three pf kramers pairs .",
    "however , similar to ref . , the degeneracy of our bound states is not protected by a fundamental system property@xcite and is susceptible to a specific kind of disorder .",

    "[ model ] we introduce the model system ; in sec .",
    "[ majorana ] we consider the non - inetracting case and find kramers pairs of majorana fermions , first for wires with soi with opposite signs and then for wires with equal signs . in sec .",

    "we consider a system consisting of two rashba qws brought into the proximity to an @xmath0-wave superconductor , see fig .",
    "[ bundle ] .",
    "the upper ( lower ) qw is labeled by the index @xmath4 ( @xmath9 ) and is aligned in the @xmath10 direction .",

    "the rashba soi field @xmath17 , that characterizes the strength and the direction of the spin polarization caused by soi , points in the @xmath3 direction in each of the two qw , so the rashba soi term is written as @xmath18 here , the pauli matrices @xmath19 act on the spin of the electron .",
    "we note that the spin projection on the @xmath3 direction is a good quantum number ( @xmath20 ) , and the dispersion relation for the spin component @xmath20 at the @xmath7-wire is given by @xmath21 , where the chemical potential @xmath22 is tuned to the crossing point between two spin - polarized bands at @xmath23 , _",

    "in addition , the intrawire superconductivity of strength @xmath6 is proximity induced in each of the qws by the tunneling of cooper pairs as a whole from the superconductor to the @xmath7-wire .",
    "the corresponding pairing term is given by @xmath27 .",

    "finally , we note that @xmath31 becomes equivalent to fflo pairing if one gauges away the soi in the wires .",
    "it is known that in one - dimensional wires the rashba soi can be gauged away by a spin - dependent gauge transformation . @xcite in our case , we gauge away the rashba soi simultaneously in both wires by the following transformation @xmath32 which is also wire - dependent ( @xmath7 ) as a consequence of opposite rashba soi . as a result ,",
    "the crossed andreev term @xmath31 becomes in this new gauge @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas @xmath34 remains unchanged .",
    "thus , the crossed andreev superconductivity has a non - uniform pairing term , @xmath35 , which manifestly breaks the translation invariance if @xmath36 .",
    "this term is related to the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state,@xcite where the cooper pair has finite total momentum .",
    "therefore , all results derived in the main part for two wires with opposite rashba soi are also valid for a system consisting of two wires without soi but coupled to an fflo - type superconductor instead of an ordinary @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "the spatial dependence makes it explicit that there can be ground states in the system with broken symmetries ( such as a charge density wave state ) , and thus states of different symmetries separated by domain walls that host bound states .",
    "we note that this situation is analogous to ref . , which finds parafermions in a one - dimensional rashba wire coupled to a superconductor and in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "there , it has been pointed out @xcite that the resulting gapped state is not within the list of possible gapped one - dimensional phases classified in ref . .",
    "as a consequence , disorder or deviations from the mean - field description of superconductivity can lift , in principle , the bound state degeneracy .",

    "in addition , the chemical potential is tuned to the soi energy in both qws , @xmath40 . to simplify analytical calculations ,",

    "we note that the choice of exactly opposite sois , such that the fermi velocities @xmath42 are the same in the two qws , is convenient but not necessary .",
    "all that is needed is to tune the individual fermi wavevectors @xmath43 ( via chemical potentials ) to the individual @xmath44 values ( or fractions thereof ) in each wire .",
    "the proximity - induced superconductivity leads to gaps in the spectrum .",
    "thus , the question arises if there are zero - energy bound states localized at the ends of the wires . to find an answer , we proceed by linearizing the spectrum around the fermi points @xmath23 and @xmath45 ( see fig .",
