    "in fusion experiments , it is a common method to heat the plasma by means of microwaves resonating with the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath1 or its harmonics .",
    "the underlying mechanism is well understood  @xcite , it allows to heat the electrons and drive significant currents . if , however , the plasma density exceeds the cutoff density for the frequency of the injected microwave , it is reflected before reaching the resonance and heating the plasma .",
    "this problem can be overcome by heating at higher harmonics of the cyclotron frequency , which requires electron temperatures of several kev to be efficient  @xcite .",
    "another approach is the utilization of electron bernstein waves ( ebws ) .",
    "these are electrostatic waves that can not propagate in vacuum and therefore need to be coupled to electromagnetic waves via mode conversion .",
    "no density cutoff exists for ebws , and they are very well absorbed at @xmath1 and its harmonics , even for low temperatures .",
    "details about the physics and applications of ebws can be found in a recent review article  @xcite .",
    "ebw heating has been successfully demonstrated in stellarators  @xcite and tokamaks  @xcite . especially in _ spherical _ tokamaks , there is a need for starting and sustaining a plasma with reduced induction current since their geometry leaves only little space for a central transformer coil .",
    "therefore , other current generation mechanisms have to be applied during the current ramp - up phase to save magnetic flux from the small solenoid .",
    "ebw current drive is one of such mechanisms , as demonstrated in tst-2  @xcite and mast  @xcite .",
    "ebw heating is also useful during the ramp - up phase , as it increases the electron temperature and decreases the collisionality , thus resulting in more effective induction .",
    "helicity injection  @xcite and fast wave heating and current drive  @xcite are also expected to benefit from electron heating by ebws in pegasus .",
    "synergistic combinations of these start - up techniques have the potential to create a suitable plasma target to hand over to ohmic heating and neutral beam injection in larger spherical tokamaks including a possible future component test facility  @xcite . in nstx , the effect of collisions on the propagation of ebw has been studied experimentally  @xcite and numerically  @xcite . for the pegasus toroidal experiment , numerical studies of ebw propagation from the conversion layer and damping at the outermost doppler - shifted electron cyclotron resonance ( ecr )",
    "have been performed in the past , mostly by means of the genray ray tracing code and the cql3d fokker - planck code  @xcite .",
    "this paper investigates the _ coupling _ of externally launched electromagnetic waves with ebws , using the 2d full - wave code ipf - fdmc  @xcite .",
    "the full - wave approach is indispensable to properly model the propagation of the o- and x - waves and their conversion into ebw because the vacuum wavelength of the injected microwaves , @xmath2  cm , is comparable with the size of the plasma ( average plasma minor radius @xmath3  cm ) .",
    "the efficiency of the coupling is studied as function of the toroidal and poloidal injection angle .",
    "the role of the shape of the plasma density profile in front of the antenna is investigated and the possibility of heating at higher harmonic of the ecr frequency is explored .",
    "thus , essential information for the design of an ebw heating system can be gained .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : pegasus ] , the pegasus toroidal experiment is introduced and the equilibrium used in the modeling is described .",
    "the full - wave code ipf - fdmc is described in section  [ s : fullwave_intro ] .",
    "plasma and wave parameter scans in 1d and 2d simulations are presented and discussed in sections  [ s : fullwave_1d ] and [ s : fullwave_2d ] , respectively .",
    "we scan the density profile , the vertical position of the plasma , the injection angles , the polarization and the frequency of the injected microwave .",
    "section  [ s : summary ] summarizes and concludes this paper .",
    "the pegasus toroidal experiment  @xcite is a low aspect ratio facility with values of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the major radius and the average plasma minor radius , respectively .",
    "it was designed to explore the operational regime for spherical tokamaks with high toroidal beta plasmas in the limit of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "ebw heating can assist during the start - up phase of pegasus as it has been done in mast  @xcite . the plasma core can be heated - up and ebw heating can provide a tool to control the current profile . furthermore , as discussed in the introduction , synergies are possible between ebw heating and helicity injection  @xcite and between ebw heating and fast wave heating  @xcite .",
    "ebw emission , heating and current drive experiments are under consideration for pegasus .",
    "an antenna would be installed for this purpose in one of the 12 equatorial ports .",

    "higher commercial and industrial standards , such as 3.6 and 5.5  ghz , are also of interest , for @xmath11 harmonic ebw heating in the present configuration , or for @xmath12 harmonic heating in a possible pegasus upgrade to higher magnetic fields .",

    "resonance frequencies can be calculated .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_cutres ] as function of the radial coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "the value of the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath19 is below the values of the cutoff frequencies in the complete cross section .",
    "hence , the cyclotron frequency is shielded by cutoffs , and the entire pegasus plasma from the lcfs inwards , can be referred as _ overdense_. it is also visible that the cutoff frequency at the lcfs is still well above 2.45  ghz .",
    "thus , the o - mode cutoff layer ( and potential o  x mode conversion layer ) for 2.45  ghz lies well _ outside _ the lcfs . in the mode conversion region , in the absence of density data from kfit , assumptions about the shape of the density profile are necessary .",
    "these assumptions are very delicate because the shape of the profile , and in particular the density gradient length in the mode conversion region , play a crucial role in the mode conversion efficiency . due to this sensitivity issue , different profiles were used in modeling the mode conversion region .",
    "figure  [ fig:1d_density_profiles]a shows the assumed radial density profile at @xmath17  m. this is the internal density profile valid _ inside _ the lcfs . it was extrapolated _ outside _ the lcfs , up to the antenna , located at @xmath10  m. three different profiles , which are based on preliminary langmuir probe measurements recently performed in the scrape - off layer , were used for the simulations presented in this paper and are shown in fig .",

    "from fig .  [ fig:1d_density_profiles]b , it can be deduced that , in pegasus , the density gradient length scale @xmath29 , normalized to the vacuum wavelength , can become as small as @xmath30 in the mode conversion region . for these steep profiles , with respect to the wavelength of the injected microwave , the geometric optics assumptions are not valid .",
    "it is therefore not possible to estimate the o  x  b mode conversion efficiency by analytic formulas  @xcite based on the validity of these assumptions .",
    "hence , a full - wave description is necessary to model the mode conversion process .",
    "the code ipf - fdmc provides such a modeling .    in this section , the conversion process that results in the generation of an ebw",
    "is briefly described followed by a description of the full - wave code ipf - fdmc .",
    "results of modeling the mode conversion process in pegasus are described in sections  [ s : fullwave_1d ] and [ s : fullwave_2d ] .",
    "the o  x  b mode conversion scheme was conceived in 1973 by preinhaelter and kopeck@xmath31  @xcite as a method to heat overdense plasmas . in this scheme , an o - mode needs to be injected from the low field side at an optimum angle with respect to the background magnetic field .",
    "this o - mode is converted into an x - mode in the vicinity of the o - mode cutoff layer , which then propagates outwards until it reaches the upper - hybrid resonance ( uhr ) layer . there",
    ", it converts into an ebw , propagating backwards , which can then be absorbed at the ecr and its harmonics .",
    "non - optimum injection angles lead to less efficient conversion , due to partial reflection from the cutoff layer or , for strongly non - optimum angles , refraction in the non - uniform plasma .",
    "the full - wave code ipf - fdmc is a finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) code , solving maxwell s equations , coupled with an equation for the current density @xmath32 , which is obtained from the fluid equation of motion of the electrons , on a cartesian grid .",
    "details on the fdtd method in general can be found in ref .",
    "the system of equations to be solved for each time step reads : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the electric and magnetic field of the wave , @xmath36 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath1 the electron cyclotron frequency and @xmath37 a collisional frequency .",
    "the @xmath38 term is responsible for collisional damping of the wave .",
    "while this damping mechanism is real and non - negligible , here it is artificially enhanced to prematurely cause the complete damping of the wave before its wavelength becomes too short ( when the x - wave is approaching the uhr ) for the adopted numerical grid to resolve it .",
    "note that this enhancement does not change the conversion efficiency  @xcite .",
    "a more realistic picture is that the slow x - wave experience some collisional damping at the uhr and converts into an ebw that propagates towards the plasma core and is cyclotron - damped in the vicinity of the outermost ecr .",
    "this treatment , however , would require a finer numerical grid , finite larmor radius corrections and a model for the cyclotron - damping of ebws suitable for full - wave calculations or , alternatively , the coupling of the o  x full - wave solution with a ray tracing code for the propagation and damping of ebws  @xcite .",
    "such improvements are left for future work .    here , @xmath35 , @xmath34 and @xmath32 are three dimensional vector fields and all three components in the @xmath5 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 direction are calculated and advanced in time , although they are treated as functions of @xmath5 and @xmath39 only . in other words ,",
    "the plasma inhomogeneity is 2-dimensional and the problem is invariant under translation in the transverse direction .",
    "the code was successfully used to model the o  x  b mode conversion process in the tj - ii stellarator  @xcite and the rfx - mod reversed field pinch  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , microwave heating ( although not by ebw ) of the tj - k stellarator  @xcite has been modeled with ipf - fdmc and a predecessor of the code has been applied to the wega stellarator  @xcite .",
    "more details about the code are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : ipffdmc_b])([eq : ipffdmc_j ] ) include only cold plasma effects , which are sufficient to model the o  x mode conversion . in the vicinity of the uhr ,",
    "the x - mode becomes more and more electrostatic , its wavelength becomes shorter and the cold plasma formulation breaks down .",
    "to resolve this singularity , it is in principle possible  @xcite to include first order finite larmor radius corrections  @xcite in the code to account for the x  b conversion .",
    "however , here , electron collisions are used to damp the x - mode around the uhr , since the inclusion of the x  b conversion would significantly increase the computational time .",
    "the reason is that the wavelength of the ebw is comparable with the electron larmor radius , i.  e. much smaller than the vacuum wavelength , thus requiring a much finer numerical grid .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to the o  x conversion in this paper .",
    "note that some effects that deteriorate the overall conversion efficiency are included in the present model , but some others are not .",
    "a deteriorating mechanism is the coupling between internal slow x - waves ( excited via the o  x conversion ) into external fast x - waves , leaving the plasma  @xcite .",
    "slow and fast x - waves are normally separated by an evanescent layer which , however , can be very thin in the low magnetic field edge of a spherical tokamak .",
    "this effect is automatically taken into account by the full - wave code .",
    "an effect , not taken into account by the code , is the parametric decay in waves of different , generally undesired frequencies  @xcite .",
    "the effect of density fluctuations on the o  x conversion , which are expected to locally and temporarily modify the optimal direction for efficient mode conversion , is also not taken into account , but will be the subject of a future study .",
    "on average , this effect is a reduction of the conversion efficiency .",
    "hence , the o  x conversion efficiency deduced from the present simulations has to be considered as an upper limit for the actual overall o  x  b conversion efficiency .",
    "note also , however , that the x  b conversion does not introduce any additional angular dependence . therefore , the optimal direction and angular tolerance of the actual o  x  b process coincide with the o  x optimal direction and angular tolerance obtained from the present simulations .",

    "the solid lines indicate the corresponding solution from the mjlhus equation@xcite . ]    for small values of @xmath43 , mjlhus formula for the conversion efficiency as a function of the injection angle  @xcite is no longer valid .",

    "their results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullwave_1d_polaopt_vs_polanonopt ] .",

    "from the 1d model discussed in the previous section , it could be deduced that for steep density profiles , the angular window to achieve maximum mode conversion efficiency is fairly large .",
    "that result is confirmed here in 2d , taking into account the geometry of the plasma and the finite size of the beam .",
    "the flux surfaces in pegasus are significantly curved , as can be seen in fig .",

    "after @xmath56 oscillation periods , a steady state situation has been reached and a conversion efficiency of 33% is found . the generated x - mode , which is visible by its enhanced wave electric field and the small scale structure , is damped at the uhr , since no x  b conversion is included in this simulation ( see sec .  [ s : fullwave_ipffdmc ] ) .",
    "in order to check for the influence of the shape of the density profile on the conversion efficiency , for each of the three profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_density_profiles]b , more than 500 runs have been performed , each with a different combination of poloidal and toroidal injection angle . the result of these calculations",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullwave_2d_oxcontour_ne267 ] , where the conversion efficiency is plotted as a function of the toroidal and poloidal injection angle .",
    "the maximum conversion efficiency is found at different injection angles for different density profiles .",
    "this is especially true for profile # 1 , as opposed to the two other profiles .",
    "the general shape of the angular window differs also when comparing the results from profile # 1 with the two others : the window becomes broader with the density profile moving closer to the antenna .",
    "the highest conversion efficiencies of 75% are also achieved for profile # 3 , in which the distance between the mode conversion layer and the antenna is the shortest .",
    "density profile # 2 and # 3 have shorter gradient lengths in the mode conversion region , and , thus , smaller values of @xmath43 , which results in the observed broader angular window ( c.  f. fig .",

    "these results clearly illustrates the importance of the knowledge of the actual density profile in front of the antenna for efficient ebw coupling .",
    "it was also shown how smaller values of @xmath43 result in larger angular windows for efficient mode conversion ( the same result was found in the 1d simulations ) .",

    "it is therefore of interest , how an ebw heating system couples with a plasma that moves vertically .",

    "note that such vertical displacements are extreme and rarely observed . even under these extreme circumstances ,",
    "the optimal launch angle in the vertical direction only varies by approximately 5  for the density profile # 1 , i.  e. by much less than the angular window width .",
    "for the two other profiles , the variation is slightly stronger , but still below 10 .",

    "one feature of ebws is that they are very well absorbed at harmonics of the ecr frequency , in contrast to conventional ecr heating , which requires electron temperatures of several kev to be efficient for higher harmonic heating  @xcite .",

    "the angular window for high efficiencies has become smaller , which is due to the fact that with the increased value of @xmath59  m@xmath60 ( @xmath61  m@xmath60 for 2.45 ghz ) , the value of @xmath43 at the conversion layer has also increased , which results in a stronger sensitivity to the injection angle , as discussed in sec .",

    "[ fig : fullwave_2d_oxcontour_grid5d6d_ne276]d  f .",
    "one can see that the angular window has become slightly smaller due to the increased value of @xmath43 .",
    "the difference between the shape of the contours of the conversion efficiency for the three different density profiles is smaller as compared with the lower microwave frequencies .",
    "this is due to the reduced relative difference of @xmath43 between the different profiles .",
    "the maximum efficiencies achieved for 5.5  ghz are similar to the case for 3.6  ghz .",
    "thus , this scenario seems also to be suitable for ebw heating .",
    "the o  x mode conversion process has been modeled with the full - wave code ipf - fdmc in the pegasus toroidal experiment . a frequency of 2.45  ghz has been chosen , since experiments are under consideration at this frequency .",
    "different density profiles , based on preliminarily langmuir probe measurements , were included in the simulations .",
    "all of these profiles are rather steep , with values of the normalized density gradient length of @xmath62 in the mode conversion layer .",
    "maximum conversion efficiencies on the order of 7075% are found .",
    "the angular window for conversion efficiencies above 50% is fairly large for all density profiles .",
    "however , they are of different shape , which illustrates that the knowledge of the shape of the actual density profile in the mode conversion region is important , even for such small values of @xmath43 , if an ebw heating and current drive system with a power level in the mw regime is considered .    an extreme vertical displacement of the plasma by @xmath63  cm , corresponding to an extreme instability , still results in high conversion efficiencies on the order of 65% , if the injection angles are not adjusted .",
    "hence , the o  x conversion is relatively stable against such displacements , thanks to the large angular windows mentioned above .",
    "for @xmath11 harmonic heating with 3.6  ghz , higher conversion efficiencies of 7580% are obtained , but the width of the angular window is slightly smaller , due to the increased value of @xmath43 at the mode conversion layer .",
    "a potential upgrade of pegasus to higher magnetic field strengths would require higher microwave frequencies , such as 5.5  ghz , for which simulations yield similar conversion efficiencies as for the case with 3.6  ghz , but with yet smaller angular windows .",
    "to conclude , the full - wave simulations showed that high o  x conversion efficiencies of up to 80% can be achieved at pegasus .",
    "these estimates represents an upper limit for the overall o  x  b conversion efficiency , the reason being that some degradation effects like the excitation of parametric instabilities during the x  b conversion are not included in the simulations yet .",
