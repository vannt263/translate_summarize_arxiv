    "in the track reconstruction process in neutrino telescopes it is customary to perform a log - likelihood minimization using a gamma function based probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the use of a so - called pandel pdf @xcite has been investigated in the reconstruction of muon tracks in the amanda detector @xcite . however , the problem with a pandel pdf is that it can not cope with negative time residuals which may result due to time jitter in the detection devices .",
    "one way to overcome this limitation is to consider a convolution of a pandel pdf with a gaussian , the latter accounting for the finite time resolution of the detector .",
    "the resulting expression , referred throughout this report as a cpandel pdf , can be evaluated analytically .",
    "this involves the superposition of various special functions , which are available in the gnu scientific library ( gsl ) @xcite .",
    "however , due to computer accuracy limitations , the numerical evaluation of a cpandel pdf is restricted to a rather limited distance - time residual domain . in this report",
    "we present analytical approximations which are necessary to extend the applicability domain of a cpandel pdf for practical cases .",
    "the implementation shown here is tailored for the geometry of the amanda neutrino telescope @xcite and has been realized in an analysis framework ( icepack ) based on root @xcite and an analysis toolbox ( ralice ) @xcite which was originally developed for the alice experiment at the future cern - lhc collider .",
    "in a reconstruction procedure , track parameters emerge as the solution of an optimization problem : given experimentally measured values ( in our case photon detection times @xmath1 ) , find the values of parameters minimizing the log of the likelihood @xmath2 .",
    "the latter is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the parameter(s ) characterizing the hypothesis of an event and the pdf @xmath5 describes a photon arrival at the receiver @xmath6 .",
    "it is convenient to use the time residual @xmath7 as a pdf variable @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the photon arrival time for a case of no scattering and no absorption .",
    "+ note that in our notation we have dropped the index @xmath6 , since for the scope of the present report it is sufficient to limit ourselves to a one source - one receiver situation .",
    "the generation of detector signals corresponds to a process in which a charged particle moves along a straight track with velocity @xmath10 exceeding the in - medium light speed @xmath11 .",
    "this gives rise to emission of cherenkov radiation , which is recorded by the detection devices .",
    "the geometrical situation is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : tgeom ] , in which the particle starts from a point @xmath12 at @xmath13 and arrives at a point @xmath14 when the cherenkov front hits the detector at @xmath15 .",
    "the track point labeled @xmath16 indicates the point of closest approach w.r.t . the receiver location .",
    "the geometrical ( expected ) arrival time can be evaluated by considering cherenkov photons emitted from the particle track and propagating freely ( without scattering and absorption ) to arrive at the receiver at @xmath15 .",
    "this specific case implies that @xmath17 .",
    "indicating by @xmath18 the time it takes for the particle to travel from @xmath16 to @xmath14 , it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : tgeom ] that in the same time interval the cherenkov front has moved with phase velocity @xmath19 from @xmath16 to @xmath20 . here @xmath21 indicates the light speed in vacuum and @xmath22 is called the phase refractive index .",
    "however , a detector is sensitive for real photons which travel with the group velocity @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is called the group refractive index . + since @xmath25 , the real photon signal lags behind the cherenkov front . in fig .  [",
    "fig : tgeom ] this is indicated by the line element @xmath26 , traveled by the real cherenkov photons in the time interval @xmath18 mentioned above .",
    "so , one can regard the real photons to be located on a wavefront given by @xmath27 which is comparable to the cherenkov front provided the complement of the cherenkov angle @xmath28 is reduced by @xmath29 . + assuming @xmath30 we have @xmath31 .",

    "minimization w.r.t .",
    "the time residuals @xmath34 for all observed signals provides the basis for track reconstruction , as mentioned before .",
    "+ to achieve this , a pandel pdf @xmath35 was suggested in @xcite  : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are phenomenological parameters related to the characteristics of the medium .",
    "+ the parameter @xmath37 represents the distance between the emission and detection locations of a cherenkov photon in units of the mean photon scattering length @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "based on the experiences from the muon track reconstruction procedure with the amanda neutrino telescope @xcite , we use the following parameter values throughout this report @xmath41    a pdf for realistic signals should account for the finite time resolution of the detector .",
    "this can be achieved by convolving a pandel pdf @xmath42 ( which describes only the propagation of photons in a medium , i.e. an ideal measurement situation of a detector with a zero time resolution ) with a time jitter function .",
    "the latter may be described by a gaussian with a mean of zero and standard deviation @xmath43 .",
    "the width of the gaussian distribution , @xmath43 , represents the time resolution of the detector and usually is made up from various sources , which motivates the use of a gaussian .",
    "we call this pdf cpandel and denote it as @xmath44  : @xmath45 the convoluted pdf @xmath46 can be calculated exactly @xcite  : @xmath47 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the confluent hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "the latter is implemented in the gnu scientific library ( gsl ) @xcite , which enables numerical evaluation of @xmath46 .",
    "accounting for the detector finite time resolution provides a solution of the problem of negative time residuals  : @xmath44 exists for any @xmath7 and causality is satisfied . for @xmath50",

    "as such , it is essential to maximize the area in which numerical evaluations of @xmath44 can be performed .",
    "+ although @xmath44 possesses all the desirable attributes for a pdf @xcite and @xmath49 is implemented in gsl , computer accuracy limitations pose a problem in minimizing the log - likelihood based on @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , the attempt to calculate @xmath55 fails due to overflow in the gsl procedure .",
    "consequently , the gsl implementation of @xmath49 does not allow evaluation of @xmath44 when the distance is 66.6 m and the time residual is 190 ns .",
    "as such , evaluation of the exact expression of @xmath44 as given by can not be performed in all the areas relevant for realistic cases .",
    "+ due to these limitations , it is necessary to find an approximation which allows numerical evaluation of the cpandel pdf in all physically relevant areas , while retaining all the qualities defined from the exact expression .",
    "our strategy is to use in the area where the gsl implementation of @xmath49 yields reliable results and outside that area use an approximation which allows extension of the support for the minimizer procedure .",
    "since the analytic properties of @xmath49 are well established @xcite , it is straightforward to find approximations for @xmath44 in terms of uniform ( i.e. numerically convergent ) expansions . ) for the cpandel pdf may disturb the approximation when another variable ( @xmath37 ) is varied @xcite . ]",
    "+ depending on the position in the @xmath56 plane ( as the minimizer moves away from the origin ) , different functions have to be used to approximate @xmath44 .",
    "however , it should be noted that these different expressions for the cpandel pdf ( corresponding to different regions in the distance - time plane ) represent the same function approximated by means of analytic continuation and uniform expansion . in other words , the results presented hereafter are not originating from introducing any new ad hoc functions or parameters .",
    "+ below we present the various expressions for the cpandel pdf corresponding to different relevant regions of the distance - time residual plane .",
    "for direct hits ( i.e. small @xmath37 and small @xmath57 ) , we can use the exact expression for @xmath44 as given by eq .  , since this is correctly handled by the gsl implementation on this domain .",
    "+ to extend the coverage to all relevant areas in the @xmath56 plane , it is necessary and sufficient to consider the following regimes for the variables @xmath37 and @xmath58 ( for @xmath58 see )  : positive and negative @xmath58 ( corresponding to @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "approximations for @xmath44 in the latter four regions exhaust all the possibilities following from the analytic continuation procedure of the function @xmath49 , of which the details can be found at the end of this report .",

    "computer limitations lead to overflow .",
    "+ to compensate for these effects , one can evaluate @xmath44 on the corresponding boundary location and impose a penalty value on the resulting log - likelihood value beyond the regions @xmath108 .",
