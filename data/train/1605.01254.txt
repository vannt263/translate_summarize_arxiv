    "massive stars play an important role in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "they deposit large amounts of radiation and inject kinetic energy into their surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) in the form of outflows and stellar winds during their short lives . at the end of their lives they release various heavy elements into the cosmic space by means of supernova explosions . understanding the formation of massive star is thus important to our knowledge of galaxy evolution .",
    "however , their formations are far less clear than their low - mass counterparts . because they are rare and most of them have large distances ( @xmath10 1 kc ) from our solar system . besides , young massive stars tend to form in clusters or groups with high dust extinction , which further makes observations of them challenging . in the last two decades , a lot of research has been done in astrophysics to understand the formation of massive stars and the feedback to their surrounding ism ( e.g. zinnecker et al .",
    "2007 ; deharveng et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that massive stars evolve through starless cores in infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) to hot cores with central young stellar objects , then to hypercompact and ultracompact hii regions , the final stages are compact and classical hii regions",
    ". however , these divisions of the process of massive star formation are rough . many questions are still unresolved .",
    "more observations are needed for detailed understanding of their formation , and it is also essential to identify their chemical properties in different evolutionary stages .",
    "to date many attempts have been done to search for massive star formation regions , using data from iras ( e.g. molinari et al .",
    "1996 ) , msx ( e.g. lumsden et al .",
    "2002 ; 2013 ) and/or spitzer ( e.g. cyganowski et al .",
    "2008 ) sky surveys .",
    "cyganowski et al . (",
    "2008 ) identified more than 300 galactic extended 4.5 @xmath11 m sources , naming extended green objects ( egos ) or `` green fuzzies '' for the common color coding of the 4.5 @xmath11 m band is green in spitzer infrared array camera ( irac ) three - color images .",
    "although the exact nature of this enhanced emission is still uncertain ( e.g. reach et al . 2006 ; de buizer @xmath12 vacca 2010 ) , egos seem to be mostly related to massive ysos as the majority of them are associated with infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) and/or red msx sources ( rmss ) ( lumsden et al . 2002 ) .",
    "molecular line observations support that egos indeed trace a population with ongoing outflow activity and the central young protostars are still embedded in infalling envelopes ( e.g. chen et al .",
    "2010 ; cyganowski et al . 2011 ; he et al .",

    "chemical composition of molecular gas is also thought to evolve due to the physical changes that occur during star formation processes .",
    "as material collapses and gets ionized by central young stars , densities and temperature rise , leading to the production and destruction of different molecular species .",

    "some observations ( e.g. hoq et al .",
    "2013 ) indicate chemical processes in massive star formation may differ from those of low - mass star formation , as their physical conditions ( such as density , temperature ) are very different . with the aim to better understand the chemical evolution of massive star formation , we made a molecular line study toward 31 ego clumps in the southern sky .",

    "our multi - molecular line data is from malt90 .",
