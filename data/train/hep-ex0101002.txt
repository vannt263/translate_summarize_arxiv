    "the unique feature of the @xmath2 linear colliders ( lc ) with the energy from hundreds gev to several tev is the possibility to construct on its basis a photon linear collider ( plc ) using the process of the compton backscattering of laser light off the high energy electrons  @xcite .    the maximum c.m.s . energy in  collisions reaches about 0.8 ( 0.9 in  collisions ) of that in  collisions .",
    "typical luminosity distribution  @xcite in  collisions has a high energy peak and some low energy part .",
    "the peak has the width at half of maximum about 15% , photons here can have high degree of circular polarization .",
    "this region is the most valuable for experimentation . comparing event rates in  and  collisions we will use the value of  luminosity in this peak .    in this talk",
    "i briefly discuss physics , possible parameters of the photon collider at tesla and a lasers  optics scheme . for more details and references",
    "see my recent paper  @xcite .",
    "physics in  and ,  collisions is quite similar because the same particles can be produced .",
    "however , reactions are different and can give complementary information .",
    "some phenomena can best be studied at photon colliders due to better accuracy ( larger cross - sections ) or larger accessible masses ( a single resonance ( in  and ) or a pair of light and heavy particles ( in ) .",
    "a short list of processes for the physics program of the photon collider is presented in table [ processes ]  @xcite .",
    "[ processes ]",
    "as it is well known in  collisions the luminosity is restricted by beamstrahlung and beam instabilities . in  collisions",
    "these effects are absent , therefore one can use beams with much smaller cross section . at present tesla beam parameters",
    "the  luminosity is determined only by the attainable geometric  luminosity .",
    "recently it was found that horizontal emittance at tesla damping ring can be reduced by a factor of 4 in comparison with the previous design .",
    "the resulting parameters of the photon collider at tesla for 2e=500 gev and h(130 ) are presented in table 2  @xcite .",
    ".parameters of the  collider based on tesla . left column for 2e=500 gev , next two columns for higgs with m=130 gev , two options : @xmath3  and @xmath4 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    figures for the luminosity distribution in  and  collisions can be found elsewhere  @xcite .    for these luminosities the rate of production of the sm higgs boson with m@xmath5=130(160 ) gev in  collisions is 0.9(3 ) of that in   collisions at 2e = 500 gev ( both reactions , zh and h@xmath6 )  @xcite .    comparing the  luminosity with the  luminosity ( @xmath7  for @xmath8 gev ) we see that for the same energy @xmath9 having beams with smaller emittances one can get higher luminosity , while  luminosity is restricted by beam collision effects .",
    "typical cross sections of interesting processes in  collisions are higher than those in collisions by about one order of magnitude  @xcite , so the number of events in   collisions will be more than that in  collisions . for example , the cross section for production of @xmath10 pairs in collisions of polarized photons is higher than that in  collisions by a factor of 20 ( not far from the threshold ) ; this means 8 times higher production rate for the luminosities given above .",
    "a key element of photon colliders is a powerful laser system which is used for e@xmath11 conversion .",
    "lasers with the required flash energies ( several j ) and pulse duration @xmath12 1 ps already exist .",
    "the main problem is the high repetition rate , about 1015 khz , with a pulse structure repeating the time structure of the electron bunches .",
    "the most attractive and reliable solution at this moment is an `` optical storage ring '' ( fig.[loop ] ) , with a diode pump laser injector .",
    "this approach can be considered as a base - line solution for the tesla photon collider  @xcite .",
    "[ loop ]    the laser pulses are send to the interaction region where they are trapped in an optical storage ring .",
    "each bunch makes about 6 round trips ( 12 collisions with the electron beams ) and then is deleted from the ring .",
    "all these tricks can be done by switching one pockels cell ( 2 round trips are possible without pockels cell ) .    a laser system required for a such optical storage ring can consist of about 8 lasers of 1.5 kw average power each . due to the high average power and reliability",
    "the lasers should be based on diode pumping .",
    "this technology is developed very actively for a inertial fusion .",
    "present cost of diodes for such laser system is about 25 m$ and it is expected that their cost will be further decreased several times .",
    "such system can be done now : all technologies exist .",
    "the luminosity in  collisions ( in the high energy peak ) can reach about 40% of  luminosity . since cross sections in  collisions are typically higher by one order of magnitude than those in  collisions and because of access to higher masses for some particles , the photon collider now has very serious physics motivation .",
    "there is good scheme for the laser system , which , it seems , can be build now .",
