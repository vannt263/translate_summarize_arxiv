    "there has been a long history for the research of epidemic spreading  @xcite . and",
    "in the general case , the epidemic system can be represented as a network where nodes stand for individuals and an edge connecting two nodes denotes the interaction between individuals . in the past",
    ", researchers mainly focused the disease transmission study on the conventional networks  @xcite such as lattices , regular tree , and er random graph . since late 1990s",
    ", scientists have presented a series of statistical complex topological characteristics  @xcite such as the small - world ( sm ) phenomenon  @xcite and scale - free ( sf ) property  @xcite by investigating many real networks including the internet  @xcite , the www  @xcite , the scientific web  @xcite , the protein networks  @xcite and so on .",
    "subsequently , the studies of dynamical processes on complex networks also have attracted lots of interests with various subjects  @xcite , and as one of the typical dynamical processes built on complex networks , epidemic spreading has been investigating intensively once more .    the basic conceptual tools in understanding the epidemic spreading and the related effective strategies for epidemic controlling should be the epidemiological models  @xcite . among the numerous possible models ,",
    "the most investigated and classical models are si model  @xcite , sis model  @xcite and sir model  @xcite , which can approximately describe the spreading of real viruses such as hiv , encephalitis , influenza virus in biological networks ; computer virus , trash mail in technological networks ; and even gossip in social networks .",
    "the most valuable result in standard sir model ( or sis model ) is that the critical threshold ( of transmission rate ) vanishes for the scale - free networks in the limit of infinite network size  @xcite .    in consideration of epidemic spreading in real cases , there",
    "yet has been some inappropriate assumption in the details of the standard sir model .",
    "we know that in the classical sir model the transmission rate @xmath3 is a constant , but in the real world , @xmath3 should be different among individuals . based on this assumption , in reference  @xcite , jaewook joo et al . proposed the effective transmission rate that they introduced a effective coefficient @xmath4 based on standard transmission rate @xmath3 for the edge @xmath5 ; similarly , in reference  @xcite , ronen olinky et al .",
    "also studied the effectiveness of the transmission rate , and in their work , the transmission rate is @xmath6 where @xmath7 means the probability that a susceptible node actually acquires the epidemic through an edge connected an infected node with degree @xmath8 . in these previous studies ,",
    "the transmission rate on a given edge is just treated as a function with degrees of the two connecting nodes , which will induce the transmission rates of two opposite directions on the same edge are symmetrical . and",
    ", their analytical methods and results which are based on the stationary state of the sis model may be not valid in the sir model .",
    "thus , in order to make the transmission rate accord with the realistic cases much more , we take into account the effects of the weights of edges and the strengths of nodes which are of great importance measures in the weighted networks  @xcite . and",
    "indeed , the weight ( or the strength ) is one of the most important indications in lots of real networks , for example , in social networks it can represent the intimacy between individuals ; in the internet the weight can imply the knowledge of its traffic flow or the bandwidths of routers  @xcite ; in the world - wide airport networks it can evaluate the importance of a airport  @xcite , and so on  @xcite . particularly , for epidemic",
    "spreading , the weight can indicate the extent of frequency of the contacting of two nodes in scale - free networks , the larger the weight is , the more intensively the two nodes communicate , at the same time , the more possible a susceptible individual will be infected through the edge where the transmission rate is larger .    on the other hand , in the classical sir model , each infected individual can establish contacts with all his / her acquaintances ( neighbors ) within one time step , that is to say",
    ", each infected node s infectivity equals its degree .",
    "but in the real case , a individual ca nt contact all his intimate friends , particularly when he is a patient . in reference",
    "@xcite , the infectivity is assumed as a constant @xmath9 , which means each infected individual will generate @xmath9 contacts at each time step .",
    "recently , fu et al . proposed a piecewise linear infectivity  @xcite , which means : if the degree @xmath8 of a node is small , its infectivity is @xmath10 ; otherwise its infectivity is @xmath9 as a saturated value when @xmath8 is beyond a constant @xmath11 .",
    "both the constant or the piecewise linear method , the heterogeneous infectivity of nodes with different degrees is not considered as adequately as possible in scale - free networks , that is to say there may be some nodes with different degrees which have the same infectivity , and there will be a large number of such nodes if the constant @xmath9 is assigned irrelevantly or the size of underlying networks is infinite .",
    "so , in order to solve these problems , we introduce the nonlinear infectivity , namely , a infectivity exponent @xmath0 will be introduced to take control of the number of contacts that a infected node generates within one time step , and the @xmath0 is between 0 and 1 which is convenient to adjust for different scale - free networks .    in this paper",
    ", we present the modified sir model where the infectivity exponent @xmath0 and the weight exponent @xmath1 are added ; based on the modified model , the dynamical differential equations for epidemic spreading is proposed .",
    "we parse the equations to investigate the threshold behavior and propagation behavior for epidemic spreading ; and the analytical results we obtain is verified by the necessary numerical stimulations .",
    "we show that one can adjust the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to rebuild the epidemic threshold to a nonzero finite value for different networks , which can prohibit or delay the epidemic outbreaks to some extent .",
    "and we find @xmath0 is more sensitive than @xmath1 in the transformation of the epidemic threshold and epidemic prevalence , which indicates the intrinsic factor ( the infectivity exponent @xmath0 ) take more responsibility than the extrinsic factor ( the weight exponent @xmath1 ) for the epidemic outbreaks in large scale - free networks .",
    "epidemic modeling has a history of researching , and mathematicians also put forward many epidemic models  @xcite . in the domain of complex networks ,",
    "sir model  @xcite is one of the most investigated and classical epidemic models . in the standard sir model",
    ", individuals can be divided into three classes depending on their states : susceptible ( healthy ) , infected and removed ( immunized or dead ) . in order to take into account the heterogeneity induced by the presence of nodes with different degrees , we use @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 to denote the densities of susceptible , infected and removed individuals with degree @xmath8 at time @xmath15 , respectively . and",
    "these variables are connected by means of the normalization : @xmath16 .",
    "the global quantities such as the ( average ) epidemic prevalence are therefore expressed by an average over the various degree classes , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "for the standard sir model , the epidemic evolves by the following rules : at each time step , a susceptible individual acquires the infection at the transmission rate @xmath3 in one contact with any neighboring infected individual , which means if a susceptible individual has a edge connecting a infected individual , the disease will transmitted to the susceptible one through the edge with a specific probability @xmath3 . on the other hand , the infected ones will recover and become immune ( ca nt be infected any more ) with rate @xmath18 , one can set @xmath19 without loss of generality .    for a comparison",
    ", firstly we review some classical results from reference  @xcite , where moreno et al . used the mean field theory to describe the dynamical differential equations of sir model as follows : @xmath20",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the conditional probability for a node with degree @xmath8 to connect a node with degree @xmath24 . in the uncorrelated case , moreno et al . obtained the epidemic threshold : @xmath25 , which implies the absence of the epidemic threshold in a wide range of scale - free networks @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "this result is a bad message for epidemic controlling and preventing , since the epidemic will prevail in many real networks with any nonzero value of transmission rate @xmath3 .",
    "in this section , we will give a detailed investigation about the modified sir model into which we introduce the weighted transmission rate and nonlinear infectivity .",
    "the results we obtain might deliver some useful information for the epidemiology . and for a better analysis , we firstly describe the general differential equations for sir model based on the mean field theory , as follows : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 have the same meaning with the standard sir model ( see section 2 ) ; and @xmath34 , @xmath35 denote the infectivity of nodes with degree @xmath24 and the transmission rate from nodes with degree @xmath24 to nodes with degree @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "different from the previous studies , in this paper , we mainly focus the sir model on the weighted networks . among varieties of weighted patterns in complex networks",
    ", making use of nodes s degrees to express the weights of edges is very important , namely , the weight between two nodes with degree @xmath8 and @xmath24 may represent as a function of their degrees  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath36 where the basic parameter @xmath37 and the exponent @xmath1 depend on the particular complex networks ( e.g. , in the _ e.coli _ matabolic network @xmath1 = 0.5 ; in the us airport network ( usan ) @xmath1 = 0.8  @xcite ; in the scientist collaboration networks ( scn ) @xmath1 = 0  @xcite ) .",
    "noteworthily , the weight @xmath38 belongs to an edge , similarly , a node ( with degree @xmath8 ) also can be measured by weights , i.e. , the strength of a node ( with degree @xmath8 ) , which can be obtained by summing the weights of the links that connected to it , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the strength of a node with degree @xmath8 . in this paper , for simplicity , we focus on uncorrelated ( also called non - assortative mixing ) networks where the conditional probability satisfies @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "thus , one can obtain @xmath42 .    here",
    ", for each node with degree @xmath8 we fixed a total transmission rate which is given by @xmath43 , and the transmission rate on the edge from the @xmath8-degree node to @xmath24-degree node , will be redistributed by the proportion of the k - degree node s strength that the edge s weight accounts for , that s to say the @xmath44 can be defined as follows : @xmath45 from which we know the more proportion of @xmath40 that the weight @xmath38 of an edge accounts for , the more possible the disease will transmit through the edge . in the uncorrelated case , one can obtain @xmath46 . moreover ,",
    "the reasonable total probability that a susceptible node with degree @xmath8 will be infected at time step @xmath15 is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the degree sequence of neighboring infected nodes that connect to the susceptible node with degree @xmath8 at time step @xmath15 .    on the other hand , from the general differential equations of sir model ( equations ( [ eq4 ] ) - ( [ eq6 ] ) )",
    ", we know @xmath49 denotes the infectivity of nodes with degree @xmath8 , and here , in the present model we define it as follows : @xmath50 which is to say , each infected individual can establish contacts with its @xmath51 neighbors within one time step .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 will dominate the infectivity among nodes with different degrees . since @xmath52",
    ", it can be adjusted to make the contacts fall on a more realistic range . and",
    "the node s infectivity will grow nonlinearly with the increasing degree @xmath8 .",
    "we take the simplified expressions of @xmath49 and @xmath44 into the equations ( [ eq4 ] ) - ( [ eq6 ] ) with @xmath19 ( without lack of generality ) , we obtain as follows : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the above equations combined with the initial conditions @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . and in the general case @xmath59 is very small , then we can obtain @xmath60 . under this approximation ,",
    "equation ( [ eq9 ] ) can be directly integrated , as follows : @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and in the last equality we have made use of equation ( [ eq11 ] ) .      in order to obtain some material results for the epidemic threshold and the average epidemic prevalence , firstly we compute the time derivative of the magnitude @xmath63  @xcite : @xmath64\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\langle k^{\\alpha}\\rangle-\\phi(t)-\\sum_{k}k^{\\alpha}p(k)s_{k}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\langle k^{\\alpha}\\rangle-\\phi(t)-\\sum_{k}k^{\\alpha}p(k)e^{-\\frac{\\lambda k^{1+\\beta}}{\\langle k^{1+\\beta}\\rangle}\\phi(t)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the general @xmath65 distribution , equation ( [ eq13 ] ) can not be solved in a closed form .",
    "however , we can still obtain some useful results in the steady state of the epidemics . since in the steady stage with sufficiently large @xmath15 , we have that @xmath66 and consequently @xmath67 d@xmath68/dt=0 , then one can get the self - consistent equation for @xmath63 from equation ( [ eq13 ] ) as follows : @xmath69 the value @xmath63=0 is always a ( trivial ) solution",
    ". then we compute the second order derivative of the rhs of equation ( [ eq14 ] ) for @xmath63 , and note that @xmath70 we can see the rhs of equation ( [ eq14 ] ) is a convex function , therefore , a nontrivial solution of equation ( [ eq14 ] ) exists only if the condition @xmath71 can be satisfied .",
    "this relation implies @xmath72 and the above inequation defines the epidemic threshold : @xmath73 below which the average epidemic prevalence ( @xmath74 ) will finally be approximatively null , and above which it will attain a finite value .",
    "one can see if @xmath75 , then @xmath76 , which induces the absence of the epidemic threshold in a wide range of scale - free networks  @xcite . and",
    "if @xmath77 , the threshold will be a finite value given by @xmath78 ; similarly , if @xmath79 , one can also get a finite threshold which is @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , we consider the epidemic threshold in the case of general scale - free networks of which the degree distribution is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the normalization constant .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 @xmath86 denotes the largest ( smallest ) degree in the underlying networks . substituting into equation ( [ eq18 ] )",
    ", one can rehandle the epidemic threshold as follows : @xmath87 from equation ( [ eq19 ] ) , one can see that the infinite of the largest degree ( @xmath88 or equally @xmath89 , since @xmath90  @xcite ) will make the epidemic threshold @xmath91 tends towards zero if @xmath92 ; on the other hand , if @xmath93 , the epidemic threshold @xmath91 is approximate to be a finite value , given by @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the critical border is @xmath95 .",
    "although for most real networks including the internet  @xcite , the www  @xcite , the world - wide airport networks  @xcite and the scientific collaborations networks  @xcite , the topology exponent @xmath96 exists between 2 and 3 , which is incidental to induce the absence of the epidemic threshold , one can adjust the infectivity exponent @xmath0 and the weight exponent @xmath1 to restore a nonzero threshold for a given networks ( a fixed value of @xmath96 ) .

    "consequently the optional objects for a infected node will decrease as time evolutes , moreover , there will be many infected nodes surrounded by the removed ones . under this situation , the epidemic spreading will arrive at a equilibrium much more quickly , and thus the epidemic prevalence in the steady stage also will be a small value as figure  [ rt4 ] displays .",
    "to sum up , in this paper , we have investigated the dynamical behavior of sir model with weighted transmission rate and nonlinear infectivity , we present that one can adjust the exponent @xmath0 and @xmath1 to control the epidemic threshold which is absent for the standard sir model in scale - free networks .",
    "the critical value just depends on the exponent @xmath0 and @xmath1 for a given topology of networks ( a fixed value of @xmath96 ) , and @xmath0 is more sensitive than @xmath1 for the transformation of the epidemic threshold and epidemic prevalence , which agrees with the numerical simulations very well . and the numerical results of the time behavior of @xmath74 also have been presented , where the remarkable result is that , for a fixed @xmath3 , the smaller threshold @xmath91 will induce a smaller epidemic prevalence at the equilibrium .    in a way , epidemic spreading can be managed as a reaction - diffusion process  @xcite , which also has a very close relation with information retrieval , peer - trust and influence spreading .",
    "the efficient diffusion or inefficient diffusion maybe has its merits in various natural and artificial networks .",
