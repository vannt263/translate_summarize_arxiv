    "the radiative efficiency is lower than that of the standard thin disk because of energy advection and photons trapping effects .",
    "the energy dissipated in the disk is advected with the accreting matter , since the radiative diffusion timescale is longer than the accretion timescale .",
    "note that the slim - disk model can not correctly treat the photon trapping , because photon trapping is basically a multi - dimensional effect ( ohsuga et al . 2002 ; 2003 ) .",

    "2000 ) and ultraluminous x - ray sources ( watarai et al . 2001 ; vierdayanti et al .",

    "their results broadly confirm the main properties predicted by the analytical slim - disk model .",
    "moreover , they show that the accretion flow is composed of the disk region around the equatorial plane and the outflow region above and below the disk .",
    "ohsuga & mineshige ( 2007 ) further identify that the supercritical accretion is feasible because a very large radiation energy density actually produces a small radiative flux as well as a force , because of the large optical depth and photon trapping effects .",
    "recently , there are some works studying the thermal stability of radiation pressure dominated thin disk using shearing box mhd numerical simulation with radiative transfer ( hirose et al .",
    "2009 ; jiang et al .",
    "hirose et al.(2009 ) found that the disk is thermally stable , while jiang et al .",

    "the reason for the discrepancy is discussed in the latter work .    in the rhd simulation of ohsuga",
    "( 2005 ) , an anomalous shear stress is included to mimic the angular momentum transfer . however , in reality , we expect maxwell stresses associated with mhd turbulence driven by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) to provide angular momentum transport in accretion flows ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) . since mri is driven only by shear associated with the orbital dynamics , when an anomalous shear stress is adopted we should only set the two azimuthal components ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) of the stress tensor to be non - zero ( stone et al.1999 )",
    ". this is confirmed by the local shearing box simulations , which indicate that the azimuthal components of the maxwell stress are one order of magnitude larger than the poloidal components ( e.g. , hawley et al.1995 , 1996 ; stone et al .",
    "1996 ) . in ohsuga",
    "( 2005 ) only the @xmath12 component of the viscous stress is included , while the @xmath13 component is neglected .",
    "so our first aim in this paper is to examine the effect of including the @xmath13 component on the dynamics of the slim disk .",
    "it should play an important role in the angular momentum transport between different latitudes and might suppress the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz instability on the boundary between the outflow regions and the disk .",
    "another aim is to study the effect of the magnitude of @xmath1 .",
    "ohsuga et al.(2005 ) only consider one value of @xmath1 .",
    "previous hd numerical simulations of non - radiative accretion flows have shown that the structure and dynamics of accretion flow depend on the value of @xmath1 ( igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 ; stone et al .",
    "1999 ; yuan et al .",
    "the radial profile of inflow rate becomes significantly flatter when @xmath1 becomes larger ( yuan et al . 2012 ) .",
    "different than the non - radiative accretion flow , a slim disk is dominated by radiation .",
    "it is thus unclear whether or how the dynamics of accretion flow depend on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "yet another aim of the present work , which is perhaps more interesting , is to examine the radial profiles of inflow rate . in almost all analytical models of accretion disks ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is assumed to be constant with radius .",
    "the validity of this assumption , however , has never been proved .",
    "for the hot accretion flows , both hd and mhd numerical simulations have found that the mass inflow rate ( refer to equation ( 4 ) for definition ) decreases inward ( e.g. , stone et al .",

    "2012 , and references therein ) .",
    "this is one of the most important findings of global simulation of accretion flows , because this result supplies an important clue to revealing the dynamics of accretion flow .",
    "various models have been proposed to explain this result such as adiabatic inflow ",

    "2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) . in the former ,",
    "it is _ assumed _ that the inward decrease of inflow rate is because of mass loss in the outflow , while in the latter the flow is assumed to be convectively unstable , and a convective envelope solution is constructed that can also explain the simulations .",

    "recent numerical simulations have shown that mhd accretion flows are convectively stable ( narayan et al .",

    "( 2012 ) argue that mass outflow should be significant .",
    "they propose that inward decrease of accretion rate is due to outflow .",
    "( 2013 ) obtained a similar conclusion . in most of the published papers , the inflow and outflow rates ( equation(4 ) and ( 5 ) )",
    "are computed at each instant of time by using instantaneous velocities , and then the time - averaged .",
    "narayan et al .",
    "( 2012 ; see also sadowski et al .",

    "2012 for more discussions on the discrepancy of the two approaches of calculating the outflow rate ) . while it is agreed that outflow exists , so far the strength of outflow is still an open question .",
    "f.yuan et al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation ) have also studied the mechanism of producing outflow .",
    "it was found that in the hd case it is buoyancy associated with the convective instability , while it is mainly magnetic centrifugal force in the case of mhd accretion flow .",

    "the radius where the two temperatures deviate depends on the mass - injection rate and viscous parameter @xmath1 . the higher the mass - injected rate and the smaller the @xmath1 , the smaller the `` deviation '' radius .",
    "however , when @xmath122 and 0.005 , the `` deviation radius '' is located around the inner boundary .",
    "the discrepancy of the two temperatures is because of the inefficient coupling between gas and radiation .",
    "the energy transfer between gas and radiation is controlled by the absorption opacity @xmath123 ( refer to the term @xmath124 ( @xmath125 is the blackbody radiation intensity ) of equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) in ohsuga et al .",
    "the absorption opacity @xmath126 is due to free - free absorption and bound - free absorption .",
    "we find @xmath127 , i.e. , @xmath123 decreases inward .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of super - eddington accretion flows by performing two - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamic simulations . compared with previous works , in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we include the @xmath0 component of the viscous stress and consider various values of the viscous parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when @xmath0 is included , the rotational speed of the high - latitude flow decreases , while the density increases and decreases at the high and low latitudes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the radial profiles of inflow and outflow rates . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the inflow rate decreases inward , following a power law form of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath3 depends on the magnitude of @xmath1 and is within the range of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the radial profile of density becomes flatter compared with the case of a constant @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the density profile can be described by @xmath6 and the value of @xmath7 is almost same for a wide range of @xmath1 ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the inward decrease of inflow accretion rate is very similar to hot accretion flows , which is attributed to the mass loss in outflows . </S>",
    "<S> to study the origin of outflow , we analyze the convective stability of the slim disk . </S>",
    "<S> we find that depending on the value of @xmath1 , the flow is marginally stable ( when @xmath1 is small ) or unstable ( when @xmath1 is large ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is different from the case of hydrodynamical hot accretion flow where radiation is dynamically unimportant and the flow is always convectively unstable . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the reason for the difference is because radiation can stabilize convection . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of outflow is thus likely because of the joint function of convection and radiation , but further investigation is required . </S>"
