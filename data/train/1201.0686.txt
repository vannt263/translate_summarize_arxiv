    ", orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) adopts cyclic prefix ( cp ) as guard interval ( gi ) to mitigate intersymbol interference ( isi ) and enable simple equalization at receiver side .",
    "however , cp is a redundant copy of the data , which reduces the useful bit - rate and degrades the spectrum efficiency .",
    "recently , it has been proposed to replace cp by a known pseudo - noise ( pn ) sequence .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the known sequence , which initially serves as gi , can be reused as training sequence to carry out channel estimation and synchronization .",
    "therefore no pilot is inserted among the useful data symbols in the frequency domain as needed in traditional cp - ofdm .",
    "this kind of ofdm waveform is referred to as time domain synchronous - ofdm ( tds - ofdm )  @xcite and has been adopted by the chinese digital television / terrestrial multimedia broadcasting ( dtmb ) system  @xcite .",
    "after perfectly removing the pn sequence , the received tds - ofdm signal is converted to the so - called zero padding ( zp)-ofdm  @xcite .",
    "then , all the well established equalization techniques  @xcite for zp - ofdm can be applied for tds - ofdm signals .",
    "the usage of the pn as gi is somehow `` double - edged sword '' . on one hand",
    ", it improves the spectrum efficiency by economizing the cost of transmitting redundant data in the cp and the pilots in the data symbols ; on the other hand , the channel memory effect introduces mutual interference between the pn sequence and the ofdm data symbols .",
    "that is to say , the interference from data symbols compromises the performance of the pn - sequence - based channel estimation and the inaccurate channel estimate consequently causes imperfect pn sequence removal and further increases the difficulty to recover the data symbols .",
    "the channel estimation is thus the key point in the tds - ofdm based transmissions .",
    "many papers have addressed this challenging issue in the past few years and can be classified into three categories :    \\1 . _ making channel estimation based only on the pn sequence . _ in  @xcite , the time domain cross - correlation between the received pn sequence and the locally generated one is used to make channel estimation .",
    "it exploits the correlation property of the pn sequence in order to obtain processing gain to combat the noise and isi .",
    "the complexity significantly grows with the increase of the length of the channel delay spread . in  @xcite ,",
    "a simple channel estimator is proposed based on the expectation ( mean value ) of the received pn sequence which cancels the random isi component .",
    "however , this algorithm only adapts to the static channel situations and requires large storage .",
    "_ removing isi from the pn sequence when making channel estimation .",
    "_ a first approach  @xcite proposed to iteratively remove the isi using the decision feedback method .",
    "however , much complexity is spent by a series of fast fourier transforms ( fft ) . in  @xcite , it is proposed to carry out the channel estimation using the pn sequence and its tail spread in the beginning part of each ofdm data symbol . by",
    "iteratively removing the data symbol , the channel estimation is progressively improved .",
    "the estimation results however suffer an error floor even at low signal to noise ratio ( snr ) due to the existence of isi in the pn sequence . @xcite",
    "proposed to alternately remove the mutual interference between the pn sequence and the ofdm data symbols .",
    "a so - called partial decision is also used to reduce the error detection of data symbols . however , the performance significantly degrades when the channel delay spread is long .",
    "@xcite also adopted the partial decision technique to remove the interference on the pn sequence from previous data symbols . in order to avoid the interference from the following data symbols , the `` tail '' of the received pn sequence",
    "is estimated and then used to reconstruct the interference - free received pn sequence for channel estimation .",
    "_ using the pilots in a complementary way to the pn sequence to enhance the channel estimation .",
    "_ it is proposed to replace some data subcarriers by pilots to improve the channel estimation performance in  @xcite .",
    "however , the spectrum efficiency is compromised .",
    "another possible solution is the data - aided channel estimation method which uses the rebuilt data symbols as `` virtual pilots '' to make channel estimation and thus does not need any extra pilots . in  @xcite , it is proposed to make hard decisions to the equalized symbols that fall in the reliable decision region .",
    "the hard decided data symbols are used as virtual pilots for channel estimation .",
    "however , this method requires an additional pn frame header for several ofdm symbol to obtain a good initial channel estimate .",
    "therefore , it is not straightforwardly applicable to the existing dtmb system . in  @xcite ,",
    "a turbo channel estimation algorithm is proposed in the context of cp - ofdm .",
    "an obvious disadvantage of this method is the extremely high complexity and long time delay , especially in the systems with sophisticated channel decoder and deep interleaver .",
    "for example , the dtmb system adopts ldpc codes and convolutional interleaver with a time delay of 170 ( or even 510 ) ofdm frames which prohibits the using of such a method .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose a low - complex but effective algorithm to increase the robustness of the channel estimation in tds - ofdm compared to the already existing techniques described above .",
    "the highlights of algorithm proposed in this paper are ( a ) excluding the channel decoder , interleaver and de - interleaver from the iterative channel estimation process to reduce complexity , ( b ) rebuilding _ soft symbols _ for channel estimation to prevent error propagation , ( c ) exploiting the correlation property of the channel to obtain improved estimation results , and ( d ) minimum mean square error ( mmse ) combination of channel estimates obtained from pn and data .    more concretely , we propose to rebuild the data symbols using the likelihood information from the _ demapper_. then the instantaneous data - aided channel estimates are acquired using these rebuilt data symbols . as the interleaving and channel decoding processes are not included in the feedback loop , the computational complexity",
    "is significantly reduced compared to the turbo channel estimation .",
    "the _ soft symbols _ are fed back in the iterations serving as virtual pilots in the channel estimation .",
    "since no decision is made on the rebuilt symbols , the proposed method does not cause error propagation due to imprudent hard decisions .",
    "the uncertainty ( noise ) is kept in the soft data symbols and in the resulting data - aided channel estimates as well .",
    "moreover , we propose several improved techniques , namely one - dimensional ( 1-d)/two - dimensional ( 2-d ) moving average and wiener filtering , which exploit the time - frequency correlation property of the channel to suppress the noise existing in the data - aided channel estimates .",
    "the cooperation of these refining techniques and soft symbol rebuilding achieves satisfactory channel estimation accuracy with low computational complexity .",
    "the final channel estimates combine the results obtained from pn and from data according to mmse criteria .",

    "more specifically , it acquires more than @xmath266 db , @xmath267 db and @xmath268 db gains over the pn - based , and methods , respectively , with qpsk in the tu-6 channel . when used with 64qam , the improvements are accordingly more than @xmath267 db , @xmath228 db and @xmath266 db , respectively . in the more harsh sfn channel case ,",
    "the improvements are more obvious .",
    "the proposed method provides @xmath269 db and @xmath270 db gains over the pn - based method and method with qpsk , respectively .",
    "compared with method , the proposed method achieves similar performance in the tu-6 channel .",
    "yet , we also notice that after the partial - decision - aided interference removal there still exists residual interference in the pn sequence .",
    "the impact of the residual interference is not serious when the channel delay spread is short ( for instance in the tu-6 channel ) .",
    "however , it becomes more harmful in the sfn channel .",
    "the performance of method significantly degrades in sfn cases .",
    "the proposed method outperforms method more than @xmath271 db and @xmath272 db with qpsk and 64qam , respectively . in addition , the residual gap between the proposed method and the perfect channel estimation case turns out to be very small . especially in the tu-6 channel ,",
    "the proposed method is only @xmath273 db to @xmath266 db away from the case using perfect channel estimation .",
    "the proposed method is robust in different channel conditions .",
    "_ it can steadily provide satisfactory performance in time - varying channels as well as the channels with long time delay spread .",
    "the method eliminates the isi by averaging the known sequence over a large number of ofdm symbols and thus requires the channel to remain unchanged within the averaging window .",
    "it is consequently not robust in face of the time - varying channel condition .",
    "in addition , it is not efficient with higher order constellations such as 64qam .",
    "in contrast , the proposed method performs channel estimation over only either one ( 1-d case ) or two ofdm symbols ( 2-d case ) .",
    "therefore , it has stronger immunity to the channel variations .",
    "moreover , the sfn channel has extremely long time delay spread with strong echoes and is thus recognized as the most difficult situation for the channel estimation .",
    "for instance , the method suffers from the interference from previous ofdm symbols and does not adapt to the sfn channel .",
    "the performance of method significantly degrades in the sfn channel due to the interference as well .",
    "in contrast , the proposed method exploits the ofdm data symbols to refine the channel estimates obtained from the pn - based estimation , which can provide reliable channel estimation in presence of long isi .",
    "_ both the moving average and the wiener filtering techniques provide satisfactory performance with different channel conditions .",
    "_ the performance difference between two methods is small in the tu-6 channel and in the sfn channel with qpsk .",
    "that is to say it is convenient to use the low - complexity moving average based estimation in the common case .",
    "however , the wiener filtering technique performs better with 64qam in the harsh sfn channel where it requires more reliable channel estimation .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in the mse simulation that the wiener filtering technique needs fewer iterations to achieve a satisfactory estimation results .",
    "in other words , it is suitable for the application that has higher restriction of processing time delay .    note that all the results are obtained using the powerful ldpc code .",
    "more gains can be expected when weaker channel codings are used .",
    "this paper proposes a novel efficient solution to the challenging channel estimation task in the tds - ofdm system .",
    "the presented algorithm takes basis on the classical pn - based estimation and processes estimation refinement by exploiting a low - complex data - aided approach .",
    "in contrast to a classical turbo channel estimation case , this new algorithm does not include the decoding and interleaving functions when rebuilding the data symbols in order to reduce the computational complexity .",
    "this enables the new proposed method to be integrated in systems which contain extremely long interleaver and sophisticated channel decoder like the dtmb system .",
    "the rebuilt soft data symbols are used as virtual pilot for data - aided channel estimation . in order to suppress the noise existing in the data - aided channel estimates ,",
    "several techniques including moving average and wiener filtering in 1-d and 2-d have been conducted .",
    "the cooperation of these refining techniques and the soft symbol feedback enables reliable data - aided channel estimation without intensive computation .",
    "simulation results show that the new proposed data - aided channel estimation algorithm provides satisfactory performance even often very close to the perfect channel estimation case .",
    "compared to already existing techniques , the proposed method performs very well in various transmission cases , including the 64qam constellation , long delay spread channels and mobility scenarios .",
    "note that the use of the novel low - complex data - aided channel estimation algorithm presented in this paper is not limited in tds - ofdm .",
    "in fact , it can be easily adopted by the traditional cp - ofdm systems where the pilot assisted channel estimate will serve as the initial estimate .",
    "take ( [ eqn_received_sig_after_pn_rml ] ) and ( [ eqn_ola ] ) , and suppose that the pn sequences are identical for all ofdm frames , the residual pn sequence in the received signal is written as : @xmath274    & = & \\sum_{l=0}^{l-1 } \\delta h_lc[n - l]_{\\nu},\\quad 0\\leq n<\\nu.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the interference for the @xmath11@xmath5 subcarrier is thus : @xmath275 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{n=0}^{n-1}\\xi[n]e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{n}nk } \\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n } } \\sum_{l=0}^{l-1 } \\delta h_l \\sum_{n=0}^{\\nu-1 } c[n - l]_{\\nu}e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{n}nk}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] denote @xmath276_{\\nu}$ ] by @xmath277 $ ] , representing a circular shift of @xmath10 bits of sequence @xmath278 $ ] towards right side .    using the us assumption , i.e. @xmath279=\\sigma_{l}^2\\delta[l - l']$ ] , the power of the interference is : @xmath280=\\mathbb{e}\\big\\{i[k]^{\\ast}i[k]\\big\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{n}\\!\\!\\sum_{l=0}^{l-1}\\sigma_{\\delta h_l}^2 \\!\\!\\!\\sum_{n_1 , n_2=0}^{\\nu-1}\\!\\!\\ !",
