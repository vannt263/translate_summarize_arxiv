    "it has been established at lower energies that the @xmath0s created in nuclear collisions are suppressed when the system size and the centrality of the collision increase  @xcite . for heavy enough nuclei",
    "the suppression exceeds the _ normal _ nuclear absorption observed with light nuclei .",
    "several mechanisms , including color screening in the quark gluon plasma , have been proposed to explain this _ abnormal _ suppression observed at low energy .",
    "measurements performed at higher energy are therefore crucial to constrain the models and discriminate between them .",
    "moreover they may uncover new mechanisms such as quark recombination .",
    "the phenix experiment measures @xmath2 decay at mid rapidity ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 decay at forward rapidity ( @xmath5 $ ] ) .",
    "electrons are identified using rich detectors and by matching their momentum measured in drift chambers with the energy deposited in electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "muons are selected using a thick absorber located close to the interaction point , tracked using cathode strip chambers and triggered on using a succession of iarocci tube planes and steel walls .",
    "the results presented here correspond to 240  @xmath6b@xmath7 au+au collisions collected in 2004 , and 3.1 nb@xmath7 cu+cu collisions in 2005 , both at @xmath1  gev . for each centrality , rapidity or transverse momentum bin ,",
    "the @xmath0 yield is obtained by counting the number of unlike - sign dilepton pairs in a mass window centered on the @xmath0 mass after the background has been subtracted using either an event mixing technique or the mass distribution of the like - sign pairs .",
    "it is corrected by the efficiency and acceptance of the spectrometer as well as the trigger efficiency and normalized to the number of recorded collisions .",
    "this yield enters the numerator of the nuclear modification factor which is the ratio between the measured yield in a+b collisions over the expected yield when assuming binary scaling from p+p collisions .",
    "the @xmath0 yield measured in p+p collisions is taken from phenix 2003 published results  @xcite .",
    "systematic errors have been assigned to each contribution .",
    "for au+au collisions , the dominant systematic error comes from the background subtraction , due to the poor signal over background ratio , especially for central collisions .",
    "figures  [ fig_vogt ] and  [ fig_theo ] represent the @xmath0 nuclear modification factor as a function of the number of participant for au+au and cu+cu collisions both at mid an forward rapidity together with the published measurement from d+au  @xcite .",
    "a suppression of about a factor 3 is observed for the most central collisions .    on figure  [ fig_vogt ] ,",
    "the data are compared to r. vogt prediction  @xcite , assuming 3  mb nuclear absorption on top of eks98 shadowing .",
    "the prediction miss the most central points .",
    "moreover , from  @xcite it appears that 3  mb is an upper bound for the nuclear absorption cross - section in d+au collisions .",

    "vertical bars are statistical errors , brackets are point to point systematics and boxes are global systematics.,width=283 ]    on figure  [ fig_theo ] the same data are compared to two sets of models .",
    "they all involve additional final state interactions and reproduce both the cern sps results  @xcite and the phenix low statistics results from 2002  @xcite .",
    "the predictions plotted on the left panel ( @xcite ) overestimate the @xmath0 suppression .",
    "the predictions plotted on the right panel show better agreement with the data or even underestimate the suppression .",
    "the predictions on the right involve either quark recombination mechanisms @xcite or detailed @xmath0 transport in medium @xcite .",
    "note however that these predictions differ in the way the cold nuclear absorption is accounted for , in the p+p @xmath0 production cross - section used for normalization and in the open charm production cross - section entering recombination mechanism .",
