    "one of basic problems in knot theory is to distinguish knots in @xmath6 from each other using knot invariants .",

    "also note that @xmath14 is a subfamily of the hyperbolic knots @xmath18 ( with some forbidden values on integers @xmath19 ) given in @xcite each of which admits a half - integral toroidal surgery ( the slope formula is given in @xcite , and recalled in section  [ topological properties of j ] of this paper ) and by @xcite these hyperbolic knots @xmath18 are the only hyperbolic knots in @xmath6 which admit non - integral toroidal surgeries .",
