    "the topological constraints produced by the windings of polymers@xcite or magnetic flux lines@xcite around each other , result in entangled phases with slow dynamics .",
    "the simplest case that can be studied is the winding of a 2-dimensional random walk around a point , or equivalently , a flux line in 3 dimensions around a columnar pin@xcite . in 1958 , spitzer@xcite showed that the probability distribution for the winding angle @xmath1 of a brownian path around a point is a cauchy law for large time @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath3 similar cauchy laws are obtained for winding around several points in 2 dimensions@xcite , and around several straight lines in 3 dimensions@xcite .",
    "these results are obtained by employing a variety of techniques such as standard diffusion equation @xcite , path integrals@xcite , or probability theory@xcite . by contrast , the winding angle of a self - avoiding walk in 2 dimensions obeys a gaussian distribution , the scaling variable being @xmath4@xcite .",

    "@xcite , the above cauchy law has pathological properties which make its relevance to any physical situation questionable .",
    "in particular , because of the slowly decaying tails at large @xmath5 , the averages of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are infinite .",
    "the origin of this divergence is that a finite segment of the brownian walk can wind infinitely often around a point center .",
    "while this is correct for an idealized random walk , in any physical system one expects a cutoff due to either finite diameters or stiffness .",
    "the case of a brownian walk in 2 dimensions around a disc of finite diameter was studied in ref .",

    "( [ abs ] ) and ( [ refl ] ) , and explains the factor 2 between their two decay constants .",
    "we argue that these two cases are applicable respectively to the windings of a flux line around a repulsive or marginal columnar defect . actually , most columnar defects are attractive and localize the flux line to their vicinity .",
    "the corresponding probability distributions ( for walkers with initial and final points close to the winding center ) are also calculated in sec .",
    "[ theord ] .    to test the generality of the analytical results",
    ", we performed a number of numerical tests that are described in sec .",
    "[ numer ] .",
    "simulations of random walks were performed on both square and cubic lattices . for reflecting boundary conditions we chose a winding center that was shifted from the lattice sites crossed by the walker . for absorbing boundary conditions , the center was one of the lattice sites which the walkers were not allowed to cross",
    ". a transfer matrix method can be used to evolve the winding angle distribution with the number of steps @xmath2 . despite a rather slow convergence to the asymptotic limit",
    ", the numerical results do indeed support the universality of distributions given in eqs .",
    "( [ abs ] ) and ( [ refl ] ) .",
    "in the course of numerical tests , we encountered one case ( reflecting boundary conditions for a directed path along the diagonal of a cubic lattice ) which did not conform to any of the above expected universality classes .",
    "further examination revealed that we had inadvertently constructed a _",
    "chiral defect _",
    ": upon encountering the defect , the path had a statistical advantage to wind in one direction as opposed to the other . in the language of random walks",
    ", this corresponds to a rotating winding center .",
    "the breaking of the symmetry at the center is in fact a relevant perturbation , and leads to a new type of probability distribution as discussed in sec .",
    "[ chiral ] .",
    "although we do not yet have a complete analytic understanding of this novel universality class , we can account for certain features of this distribution . in particular , weak chirality leads to narrow asymmetric distributions , while for strong chirality both wings of the distribution are widened , i.e. strong chirality of the defect enhances entanglements .",
    "all the distributions examined in secs .  [ theor][chiral ] describe the windings of _ ideal _ random walks , and in all cases the appropriate scaling variable is the combination @xmath10 .",
    "this universal feature is due to the _ markovian _ nature of these walks , and can be explained as follows : after time @xmath2 , the walker has a typical distance @xmath11 from the starting point , which is chosen to be close to the winding center . assuming that @xmath12 is the only relevant length scale , dimensional arguments , combined with the markovian property , suggest that @xmath13 .",
    "the rotational invariance of the system implies that @xmath14 must be a constant , i.e. the increase in winding angle can not depend on the number of windings or angular position .",
    "hence , @xmath15 leading to a scaling variable proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "because of their non - markovian nature , we can not apply the arguments of the preceding paragraph to _ self - avoiding walks_. indeed , such walks have a gaussian winding angle distribution in the scaling variable @xmath17@xcite .",
    "the self - similarity of the walk suggests the following scaling argument : starting from the origin divide the walk into segments of 1 , 2 , @xmath18 steps .",
    "since the @xmath19 segment is at a distance of roughly @xmath20 from the center ( with @xmath21 ) and has a characteristic size of the same order , it is reasonable to assume that each segment spans a random angle @xmath22 of order one . under the mild assumption that the sum @xmath23 satisfies the central limit theorem ,",
    "we then conclude that @xmath1 is gaussian distributed with a variance proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "we can ask why the above argument of self - similarity does not apply to ideal walks .",
    "the reason is the relevance of the finite winding center .",
    "an important difference between ideal and self - avoiding walks is that the probability of returning to the winding center at the origin asymptotically vanishes for the latter because of the exclusion zone set up by self - avoidance .",
    "it is thus expected that properties of the winding center ( size , absorbing versus reflecting nature , chirality ) are irrelevant for self - avoiding walks .",
    "the ideal walks , on the other hand return to the origin quite often , and upon rescaling see winding centers of different size .",
    "the assumption that different scaled portions of the ideal walk are self - similar is not correct .",
    "there is one case where both arguments should hold : an ideal walk around a point winding center .",
    "the argument based on self - similarity actually states that the final distribution is obtained from the composition of @xmath25 independent random variables .",
    "if each variable has a finite variance , the overall distribution will be gaussian . if not , other ( levy ) distributions are possible .",
    "the cauchy distribution is in fact a limiting case for widely distributed variables .",
    "the requirement that both arguments should hold , immediately selects a cauchy distribution !    the scaling argument , which by no means is claimed to be exact , should apply to other self - similar walks where the probability of return to the origin is small .",
    "an interesting example is provided by directed paths in random media @xcite , which for example describe the behavior of a flux line in the presence of ( quenched ) point impurities .",
    "typical wanderings of such paths scale as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    "the pinning by impurities greatly reduces the probability of the walker returning to the origin , and the above arguments again suggests that the winding angle distribution is gaussian . although certainly not conclusive , the numerical results reported in sec .  [ random ] appear to support this prediction .",
    "typical winding angles thus scale as @xmath28 as opposed to @xmath25 in the pure case .",
    "this simple example thus suggests that topological entanglements become relatively less important in the presence of pinning to impurities .",
    "the results of this paper point out the rich behavior already present in the simplest of problems involving topological defects .",
    "properties of the winding center ( finite size , chirality , @xmath29 ) , interactions , various types of randomness are all potentially relevant , leading to different universal distribution functions .",
    "these results could also produce some interesting physical manifestations .",
    "for example , we demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ concl ] that there is a sharp crossover between free and coiled configurations , if there is an energy proportional to the winding number .",
    "before studying the winding of a brownian path around a center of finite diameter , we first sketch a derivation of spitzer s law in eq .",
    "( [ cauchy ] ) .",
    "we follow the approach in ref.@xcite , translating it into a more physical language that does not rely on a familiarity with martingales .",
    "a basic ingredient is the invariance of brownian motion under conformal mappings .",
    "let @xmath30 represent the original walk in the complexified two - dimensional plane .",
    "the time evolution of each random walker satisfies @xmath31 where the complex random velocity has zero mean and is uncorrelated at different times , with @xmath32 the radius of the walker , and its winding angle can be extracted from @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath35 , the stochastic motion of the walker in the new complex plane is highly correlated to its location .",
    "this feature can be removed by defining a new time variable @xmath36 _ for each walker _ , which leads to @xmath37 since @xmath38 the evolution of @xmath39 is that of a brownian walk .    for simplicity",
    "we choose the initial condition @xmath40 , i.e. the original walker starts out at @xmath41 .",
    "we also set the diffusion constant to @xmath42 , so that the mean square distance over which the walk moves during a time @xmath2 is @xmath43 . since there is a separate transformation @xmath44 for each walker , it is not useful to subdivide the walkers @xmath45 according to @xmath46 .",
    "instead the walkers of interest are the ones that reach lines of fixed @xmath47 _ for the first time _ , independent of the value of @xmath46 .",
    "this is because after a time @xmath2 , the value of @xmath47 is almost certainly equal to @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , the probability that @xmath12 is within an interval @xmath48 $ ] around its mean value of @xmath49 , @xmath50 approaches unity in the limit @xmath51 . in this limit , the distance @xmath52 from the starting point @xmath41 is identical to the distance from the origin , and @xmath53 is identical to the probability that @xmath39 is in the interval @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "we next shrink the complex plane @xmath45 by a factor of @xmath55 .",
    "the walkers of interest are now those that hit the line with real value of unity for the first time .",
    "the imaginary coordinate @xmath5 , of the hit is now related to the winding angle by @xmath56 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath57 , the probability @xmath58 is precisely the probability that a brownian walker ( @xmath59 ) starting from the origin , hits a vertical line at a distance one from the origin , for the first time , at a height between @xmath5 and @xmath60 .",
    "since the walkers hit the line for the first time at different times @xmath46 , we need the probability density @xmath61 that the first hit is at @xmath46 .",
    "its integral @xmath62 , is the probability for the walker to hit the line at least once before time @xmath46 . since after hitting the wall",
    "the walker is equally likely to proceed in either direction , the latter is also twice the probability that the endpoint of the walk is beyond the line at @xmath46 , and hence given by @xmath63 the derivative gives @xmath64 since the vertical and horizontal components of the walk are independent , we finally obtain @xmath65 which is spitzer s law ; exact in the limit @xmath51 .",

    "each bond can be crossed only in one direction , and the winding center for reflecting boundary conditions must be different from the vertices of the lattice .",

    "the resulting coarse - grained random walk takes place on a regular triangular lattice , but now the walker has a finite probability of @xmath163 of staying at the same site .",

    "the walker has a finite probability of having its winding angle increased in the proximity of the center .",
    "the amount of this biased increase in angle depends on the structure of the lattice and will be different for other directed lattices .",
    "an equivalent physical situation occurs for brownian motion around a rotating winding center , e.g. a rotating reflecting disc which does not set the surrounding gas or liquid into motion .    since this angular symmetry breaking is already present in the above simple example of a directed walk , it is also likely to occur in more realistic physical systems , such as with screw dislocations .",
    "we thus use the term _ chiral _ columnar defect , to indicate that each time the fl comes close to the defect , it finds it easier to wind around in one direction as opposed to the other .",

    "an important consequence of the pinning is that the path wanders away from the origin much more than a random walk , its transverse fluctuations scaling as @xmath26 , where @xmath177 in three dimensions , and @xmath178 in two dimensions@xcite .",

    "( a simple scaling argument suggests that the number of returns to the origin scale as @xmath184 . ) the conformal mapping of section [ theor ] can not be applied in either case : the density and size of impurities in a random medium becomes coordinate dependent under this mapping , as does the excluded volume effect .",

    "the winding angle is ( statistically speaking ) conserved , and consequently all segments have the same winding angle distribution . convoluting the winding angle distributions of all segments , and assuming that the correlations between segments do not invalidate the applicability of the central limit theorem , leads to a gaussian distribution with a width proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "this argument does not work for the random walks considered in section [ theorb][theord ] , since the finite radius of the winding center is a relevant parameter .",
    "different segments of the walk are therefore not statistically equivalent , as they see a winding center of different radius after rescaling .",
    "another interesting quantitity to study is the difference in free energy between configurations of different winding numbers .",
    "this provides an estimate of the free energy that can be gained ( or lost ) by a fl upon changing its degree of entanglement . in the pure system",

    "-1 cm    -1 cm    similar results are expected to hold for the windings and entanglements of two fls around each other .",
    "the interactions between the fls are small at large separations ( very small density ) , and the relative distance between the lines behaves in the same way as the separation of one line from a columnar defect . in the pure system",
    ", we had to distinguish between repulsive , neutral , and attractive defects . since in the presence of point impurities",
    "the line does not return to the origin as often , the interaction with the defect is less relevant . in fact",
    ", it can be shown that the attraction of the columnar defect must exceed a finite threshold before it can pin a fl@xcite .",
    "thus the results of this section regarding the gaussian distribution of the fl winding angle in the presence of point impurities are expected to hold even for the more realistic attractive columnar pins .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , the main conclusion is that the pinning to point randomness decreases entanglement .",
    "topological entanglements present strong challenges to our understanding of the dynamics of polymers and flux lines . in this paper",

    "we were able to uncover a variety of interesting properties : the probability distributions for the winding angles can be classified into a number of universality classes characterized by the presence or absence of underlying symmetries or relevant length scales .",
    "the most  symmetric \" situation is the windings of an ideal ( brownian ) walk around a point center , described by the cauchy distribution in eq .",
    "( [ cauchy ] ) .",
    "introduction of a finite core for the winding center ( or a finite persistence length for the walk ) leads to a number of exponentially decaying distributions : if there is a conservation law for the walkers ( reflecting boundaries or neutral defects ) , we obtain the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ refl ] ) . removing",
    "this conservation ( absorbing boundaries or repulsive defects ) leads to the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ abs ] ) whose tails decay twice as fast .",
    "constraining the end - points of the walker to the vicinity of the winding center leads to the related distributions in sec .",

    "a completely new set of distributions is obtained for chiral defects , where the walker is preferentially twisted in one direction at the winding center .",
    "these distributions have asymmetric exponential tails , with decay constants that depend on the degree of chirality .",
    "strong chirality appears to lead to quite broad distributions .",
    "a remaining challenge is to find the complete form of this probability distribution by solving the two dimensional diffusion equation with moving boundary conditions .    for non - ideal walks , with a vanishing probability to return to the origin ,",
    "the properties of the winding center are expected to be irrelevant .",
    "both self - avoiding walks in @xmath196 dimensions , and fls pinned by point impurities in @xmath197 , have wandering exponents @xmath102 larger than 1/2 and fall in this category .",
    "we present a scaling argument ( supported by numerical data ) that in this the probability distribution has a gaussian form in the variable @xmath198 .",
    "not surprisingly , wandering away from the center reduces entanglement .",
    "the characteristic width of the gaussian form is presumably a universal constant that has been calculated exactly for self - avoiding walks in @xmath196 .",
    "it would be intersting to see if this constant ( only estimated numerically for the impurity pinned fls in @xmath197 ) can be related to other universal properties of the walk .",
    "changing the correlations of impurities ( and hence the exponent @xmath102 ) may provide a way of exploring such dependence .",
    "it is likely that there are other universality classes not explored in this paper .",
    "the physical problem of fls in superconductors provides several candidates , such as splayed columnar pins or a collection of pins with random strengths .",
    "one example , is defects with randomly changing chirality , which induce a change @xmath199 in winding angle each time the line returns to the defect .",
    "such randomness is in fact irrelevant in the limit @xmath200 , since it does not lead to no systematic change of the variable @xmath5 .",
    "the induced variance in @xmath5 also vanishes as @xmath201 the underlying problem is certainly quite rich and seems to call for developing some form of renormalization group analysis .",
    "it is also interesting to search for circumstances in which the degree of winding changes dramatically . to compete with the exponential tail of the winding angle distribution , we need an energy proportional to the winding angle itself ; a non - local quantity .",
    "a possible physical realization is provided by a magnetized directed polymer winding around a wire .",
    "a current @xmath202 in the wire generates a magnetic field @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the speed of light . assuming that the polymer carries a uniform magnetic moment density @xmath205 aligned with its backbone , then leads to an energy @xmath206 proportional to the winding number @xmath189 .    in the presence of an energy @xmath207 per winding , and",
    "assuming absorbing boundary conditions , the partition function is given by @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the winding number , @xmath210 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath144 is the temperature .",
    "the integral `` diverges '' if @xmath211 , a cutoff only being given by the maximum possible winding number , proportional to @xmath2 . a directed path ,",
    "although free on length scales @xmath212 , is always coiled in the limit of @xmath51 .",
    "however , for a given length @xmath2 , a small decrease in temperature can induce a sharp crossover from a free to a coiled configuration due to the exponential dependence of the crossover length @xmath213 on temperature .",
    "a similarly sharp crossover occurs for the pinning of a fl to an attractive columnar defect @xcite ( see subsection [ theord ] ) .",
    "both transitions are related to the number of returns of a random walk to the origin which scales as @xmath214 .",
