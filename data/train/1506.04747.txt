    "observations of nearby galaxies with the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ , along with observations of the far - ir ( fir)/submillimetre background with the _ cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) _ , showed that the universe emits a comparable energy density at infrared ( ir ) and submillimetre wavelengths as it does at optical and ultraviolet wavebands ( e.g. ; ; @xcite ) . a breakthrough in resolving",
    "this background came with the discovery of a large population of bright sources at high redshift through single - dish telescopes observations at submillimetre wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these ( sub)millimetre - selected galaxies ( hereafter smgs ) are characterized by large fir luminosities ( @xmath11 l@xmath12 ) , large star formation rates ( sfrs , @xmath13 m@xmath12 yr@xmath14 ) , large gas reservoirs ( @xmath15 m@xmath12 ) , and a number density that is high compared to local ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( @xcite ; see also review by @xcite ) .    however , identifying and understanding the nature of these sources has proven to be challenging due to the low angular resolution of single - dish telescopes and the faintness of these galaxies in the rest - frame optical and ultraviolet bands , which makes the association with the correct counterpart difficult ( @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution radio / mid - infrared observations have often been used to identify counterpart galaxies on @xmath16 arcsec scales ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , providing the precision needed to target optical redshifts , which are essential to understand the physical nature of these sources .",
    "however , recent submillimetre interferometric observations have shown that resourcing to surrogate wavelengths could miss @xmath17 per cent of smgs , and of those which are claimed to be identified , approximately one third are incorrect (; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the use of these wavelengths suffers from a well - known systematic bias against high - redshift ( @xmath18 ) sources and therefore our understanding of these galaxies could be incomplete .",
    "millimetric spectroscopy provides the best way to determine redshifts for this population of galaxies , since they are expected to have luminous emission lines in the millimetre bands .",
    "furthermore , the cold molecular phase of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is an excellent tracer of the molecular gas reservoir , and the overall galaxy dynamics .",
    "for instance , co(10 ) has been extensively used to map the molecular gas content of this kind of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also review by ) . when combined with the sfrs ( or fir luminosities )",
    ", gas masses also provide estimations of the star formation efficiencies ( sfe ) , which is an important parameter for models of galaxy evolution ( e.g. ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , co spectroscopy is very time consuming , when retuning receivers to search for molecular line emission , requiring entire nights to detect a single source , and in some cases with no successful detection ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this method has only recently become competitive with the increased bandwidth of ( sub)mm facilities , but is still not yet sufficiently efficient to obtain redshifts for substantially large samples of unlensed smgs ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , co line observations for strongly lensed systems can be obtained more easily , representing one route to study the molecular gas content of smgs ( e.g. ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although in some cases , differential magnification could affect the properties derived from observations ( e.g. line ratios , @xcite ) , cluster lensing provide us more reliable results since is rare to find this kind of magnification gradients .",
    "here we present new observations of a sample of four cluster - lensed smgs , discovered by the _",
    "herschel _ lensing survey - snapshot ( hls - snapshot , egami et al . in preparation",
    "; see also ) and subsequently detected with the submillimetre common - user bolometer array-2 ( scuba-2 , @xcite ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) as part of the scuba-2 cluster snapshot survey ( s2css , geach et al . in preparation ) .",

    "three of the four galaxies have a spire flux densities of more than 100 mjy at either 250 , 350 or 500 @xmath24 m , and have subsequently produced bright detections in the s2css . the remaining target ( hls j102225.9 + 500536 ) was detected by hls below the 100 mjy threshold but was comparably bright at 850 @xmath24 m .",

    "the visibility data were resampled and averaged to a velocity resolution of 20 km s@xmath14 , and then binned further to 100 km s@xmath14 resolution in the imaging routine .",
    "the rms noise obtained in the final images was 15.2 mjy beam@xmath14 per 100 km s@xmath14 channel .",
    "these observations showed the presence of three distinct sources with a clear emission line feature at 334.6 ghz .",
    "averaging consistent the spectra from these three positions produced the spectrum shown in fig .",

    "the analysis of the triple system and constraints to the lensing model of rxcj2043.22144 ( macs j2043.22144 ) will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "since the main goal of these observations is to blindly search for molecular lines in our spectra , with no previous knowledge on the expected observed frequencies for these lines , it is important to define a criteria s / n threshold ( @xmath42 ) that ensures the reliability of detections and that maintains the false detection rate very low .    to estimate the global noise of the spectra we fit the histogram of pixel values with gaussian distributions . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spectralnoise ] , a gaussian fit reproduces very well the spectrum , and can be used as an estimation of the average noise .",

    "these simulations assume that the noise is uniform at all frequencies and uncorrelated between pixels .",
    "using 100,000 realizations we find that the probability to have two adjacent pixels with s / n@xmath44 is less than 0.1 per cent , and therefore this s / n ratio could be used as a detection threshold . to investigate the reliability of these simulations we search for negative peaks , which are expected to be just noise , that satisfy this s / n threshold .",

    "we do not find any such case . in order to find weaker emission lines , we rebin our spectra into 200 km s@xmath14 pixels ( 2 pixels bins ) and repeat the process again . once we have the position of line candidates we carry out a gaussian line profile fit in order to obtain the central frequency , peak flux , and line width .",
    "although the general noise is well fitted by a gaussian distribution ( see fig . [ spectralnoise ] ) and the baseline fluctuations in each spectrum are well confined within the @xmath70 noise range ( see fig . [ imagenes ] ) , there are some baseline residuals that exceed this range or where the noise seems correlated .",
    "these baseline features are usually broad ( @xmath71 km s@xmath14 ) and therefore could preclude the detection of low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n@xmath72 ) broad lines ( albeit the fraction of smgs with very broad lines , @xmath71 km s@xmath14 , have been found to be low , e.g. 1/32 , @xcite ) .",
    "broad lines could be missed since our method is based on the detection of high s / n pixels . however",
    ", a different method has been developed , which exploits the full spectral information present in the rsr data by cross - correlating the observed spectrum with a theoretical or an empirical spectral template ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed description of this method and its application to the smg cosmos aztec-1 is described by @xcite , and we briefly summarize it here .",
    "a cross - correlation product is derived as a function of redshift from the observed spectrum and a model spectral template .",
    "this model is weighted by a function which represents the relative strength of different molecular transitions , and for this , an empirical composite spectrum based on observed relative line strengths for high redshift sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) is adopted .",
    "this is a powerful method to derive redshifts which takes into account the information of many transitions which are not individually detected with a good s / n .",
    "we find that the redshift results are robust , and both methods give consistent results , when the integrated s / n of the lines are sufficiently high ( s / n@xmath73 ) .    in table",
    "[ espectros ] we summarize the lines detected in our spectra and fig .",

    "all these detections have at least one peak pixel at s / n@xmath74 in the raw or in the binned spectra and at least one adjacent pixel with s / n@xmath44 ( except for a line that is not formally detected by our algorithm , see  [ macsj2043 ] ) .",
    "however , a better estimation of the reliability of these detections is the s / n of the whole integrated line , which is also reported in table [ espectros ] .",
    "all the lines detected originally by our algorithm have integrated s / n@xmath73 .        in order to derive the spectroscopic redshifts we have first to associate the detected lines candidates with the correct molecular transitions .",
    "the simultaneous frequency coverage of the rsr means at least one co transition falls within the spectral coverage at all redshifts except for a narrow redshift range ( the ` redshift desert ' ) in the range @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , two or more molecular line transitions fall within the rsr spectral range at @xmath76 if we consider the possibility of a [ ci ] line detection in addition to the co lines .",
    "on the other hand , since we know that the spectral line energy distribution ( sled ) peaks at j@xmath77 for typical smgs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the absence of lines could be used to discard the high - redshift solutions for which we expect more than one line in our spectra . moreover",
    ", our selection of bright sources through galaxy clusters , implies that these very bright smgs are expected to be gravitationally lensed .",
    "this selection tends to exclude low - redshift solutions , @xmath78 , due to the low probability of being lensed at these redshifts , as discussed by @xcite . taking these considerations into account , we associate our line candidates with different @xmath2co ( j@xmath79 ) transitions and derive the spectroscopic redshift for each galaxy ( see table [ espectros ] ) .",
    "below we describe briefly the analysis for individual targets .",
    "a line with an integrated s / n=7.3 with a well - fitted gaussian profile ( see fig . [ lines_all ] ) has been detected in this spectrum .",

    "the spectrum , however , does not show any line feature around this frequency and , therefore , this solution is discarded .",
    "other possible solutions are co(32 ) or co(21 ) , which correspond to redshifts of @xmath83 and @xmath54 , respectively . as we expect that the probability for these galaxies to lie around @xmath84 is higher ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we have associated our line candidate with the co(32 ) at @xmath83 , although we can not rule out the alternative lower redshift solution .      for this source",
    "we have no detections at s / n@xmath44 , either in the raw or in the binned spectrum .",
    "one possible explanation is that the galaxy lies in the ` redshift desert ' of the rsr .",
    "however , as we can see in table [ fotometria ] , this galaxy has the lowest flux density at 1.1 mm , which is less than half of those of the rest of the sample .",
    "this would suggest that we need to integrate more in this fainter galaxy to detect a co emission line .",
    "furthermore the ratio @xmath85 is the largest of the sample , which could be due to a higher temperature , and make more difficult the detection of molecular lines than in the other sources .",
    "the upper limit for a line could be calculated using the equation @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the rms noise , @xmath88 the velocity resolution , and @xmath89 the line width ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we adopted a line width of 500 km s@xmath14 similar to the lines detected in the remaining spectra ( see table [ espectros ] ) , and a @xmath87 derived from the standard deviation of the whole spectrum .",
    "using this equation the upper limit for a line is 1.2 jy km s@xmath14 .",
    "this is another case of single - line detection at @xmath90 ghz with a line integrated s / n=5.7 . in this case",
    "we can associate this transition with co(43 ) at @xmath91 or co(32 ) at @xmath92 having rejected the co(21 ) solution at @xmath93 due to the low probability of lensing at this lower redshift .",
    "independently , earlier observations made by the hls team had already identified the redshift of this galaxy through a co redshift search with the iram 30-m / emir , yielding @xmath92 through the detections of co(54 ) and co(32 ) ( dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , and hence our single line detection unambiguously corresponds to co(32 ) .",
    "the line - shape shows some departure from a single gaussian profile .",
    "however , due to the low pixel - to - pixel s / n , we can not be certain of the non - gaussianity , and hence , we decided to perform a single gaussian fit .",
    "if we were to fit two gaussian profiles , the resulting fwhm for both components are @xmath94 km s@xmath14 centred at 93.130 and 93.223 ghz , with a total flux line similar to the one recovered with the one fit procedure .      in this case , we have detected four lines with s / n@xmath44 in the spectrum at @xmath95 , 81.178 , 101.459 , and 108.428 ghz .",
    "they are not compatible with a single redshift solution , which indicates that we have at least two sources inside our rsr beam .    as a first step to associate these detections with co transitions , we find that the 81.2 and 101.5 ghz lines agree very well with co(43 ) and co(54 ) at @xmath96",
    ", however there is no explanation for the 76 and 108 ghz lines at this redshift .",

    "the closest detected line however is at 101.461 ghz , more than 1000 km / s away , and furthermore we know that this line corresponds to the co(54 ) transition at @xmath96 .",
    "hence we discard this @xmath101 redshift solution .",
    "other evidence that the 76 ghz line arises from a different source is the brightness of the line and the asymmetric line shape seen in figs [ imagenes ] and [ lines_all ] , whilst the 81 and 101 ghz lines are more similar in line width and shape .",
