    "precision determination of the light hadron spectrum is a fundamental problem of lattice qcd . over the years",
    "numerous studies have been carried out on this subject , which have revealed a number of difficulties that have to be overcome to achieve this goal .",
    "in addition to the overriding issue of how quenching distorts the spectrum , calculations aiming at precise results have to have good control over the systematic errors arising from a finite spatial lattice size , an extrapolation toward light quark masses , and an extrapolation to the continuum limit .",
    "there is also the issue of how reliably one can extract hadron masses from the propagators whose statistical errors generally grow exponentially with the distance from the source point .    within quenched qcd high statistics calculations on large lattices attempting to deal with these problems gradually developed since around 1990 exploiting the power of dedicated parallel computers@xcite .",
    "in particular weingarten and collaborators with the gf11 computer carried out a pioneering work on the continuum limit of the quenched spectrum with extensive simulations including finite size studies@xcite . in spite of these efforts convincing results on hadron masses in quenched qcd with a precision reliably better than 5%",
    "have not been obtained .",
    "in particular the question in what way the quenched spectrum deviates from the experiment has not been fully answered so far .    in view of this situation",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration has decided to undertake a quenched simulation of the light hadron spectrum as the first lattice qcd project of the cp - pacs computer which started operation in april 1996 .",
    "the strategy we have chosen is to employ the simplest form of the action , _",
    "i.e. , _ the plaquette action for gluons and the wilson action for quarks , and carry out , as much as the computing power of cp - pacs allows , a measurement of hadron masses down to small quark masses at small lattice spacings employing large lattices and high statistics .",
    "the simulation has been running since the summer of 1996 and are still continuing . in this article",
    "we report the present status of the work .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "= 7.5 cm    our first interest is how hadron masses depend on the quark mass .",
    "we start with the pseudo scalar case , and plot in fig.[fig : pi2mq ] the ratio @xmath5 $ ] against @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are quark masses defined by @xmath8 .",
    "conversion to physical units is made with estimates of lattice spacing in terms of @xmath9 as described below .",
    "the critical hopping parameter @xmath10 is determined by a linear extrapolation of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denotes the one - loop renormalization factor ( see sec.[sec : quarkmass ] for details ) .",
    "the ratio for 11 combinations of quark masses is constant within errors at each @xmath3 .",
    "therefore we conclude that the pseudo scalar meson mass squared is linear in the average quark mass in the range covered by our data . in other words",
    ", we find no clear evidence for the existence of chiral perturbation theory higher order terms or quenched chiral logarithms@xcite in the results of pseudo scalar meson masses down to @xmath13 30 mev .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    vector mesons and decuplet baryons also exhibit the property that their masses are linear in the average of quark masses with only a small mixture of higher order terms .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig : meson ] and [ fig : decuplet ] in which hadron masses are plotted against @xmath14 of lighter quark , together with results of a linear ( pseudo scalar case ) or quadratic ( vector and decuplet case ) fit .",
    "however , this property is badly broken for octet baryons as shown in fig.[fig : octet ] . although @xmath15 and @xmath16 masses are linear in @xmath14 , nucleon and @xmath17 masses are convex .",
    "the nucleon mass at the lightest quark mass is clearly off the linear fit ( dashed line ) as compared to a cubic fit shown by a solid line .    in this connection",
    "we show our results for @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 in fig.[fig : edplot ] .",
    "dotted and thick curves correspond to the cases in which the nucleon mass at @xmath20 6.25 is fitted with a linear or cubic functions of quark mass , respectively .",
    "higher order terms are essential in order to make a reliable extrapolation of nucleon and @xmath17 masses to the chiral limit , and have a significant impact on final results .    based on the considerations described above , we employ a linear fit for pseudo - scalar mesons , cubic fit for nucleon and quadratic fit for other hadrons in order to extrapolate or interpolate hadron mass results to physical quark masses at each @xmath3 . for vector mesons a linear fit reads to essentially the same result .",
    "we then determine values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 taking the experimental values of @xmath23 and @xmath9 .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath24 for strange quark is estimated in two ways , either from @xmath25 assumed to be a pure @xmath26 state or from @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "for the latter case we take meson mass data for unequal quark masses and first make an extrapolation of lighter quark to @xmath21 with the heavier quark fixed at @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we then linearly interpolate the result so that @xmath4 or @xmath31 meson mass has the experimental value . for experimental values",

    "our results are consistent with those reported so far @xcite for the wilson action",
    ". our errors , however , are much reduced . in fig.[fig : scale](b ) are compared our results with those for the kogut - susskind action@xcite and those from string tension@xcite .",

    "[ sec : extrap ] strange quark mass can be determined in two ways . in fig.[fig : mesone](a ) we take @xmath27 as input and predict the masses of @xmath41 and @xmath31 meson .",
    "the values extrapolated to the continuum disagree with experimental values plotted by open circles at @xmath42 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the results of the gf11 collaboration@xcite plotted by open squares .",
    "they linearly extrapolate data measured on lattices with a spatial extent of about 2.3 fm ( dashed lines ) .",
    "they then make a finite size correction to the extrapolated value , and obtain a result which agree well with experiment .",
    "the best fit to our data differ from those by gf11 taken on a 2.3 fm lattice , while their data on a 3.3 fm lattice at @xmath43 are consistent with a linear fit of our results .",
    "we show an alternative procedure in fig.[fig : mesone](b ) where we plot results for @xmath27 and @xmath28 when we take @xmath25 as input . in this case , the value of @xmath28 in the continuum limit is consistent with experiment , while that for @xmath27 is much higher .",
    "these results mean that there are no choice of strange quark mass which leads to an agreement of vector as well as pseudo - scalar meson masses .",
    "the @xmath44 parameter@xcite is a convenient quantity to summarize the situation . as shown in fig.[fig :",
    "j](a ) , the value of @xmath44 in the continuum limit is smaller than the experimental value by more than 2 standard deviations . in fig.[fig : j](b ) , we compare our results with those obtained with the kogut - susskind quark action@xcite and the clover quark action@xcite . in the continuum limit ,",
    "the two actions give a result consistent with that of the wilson action .",

    "for the nucleon our continuum extrapolated value is about 5% smaller than experiment .",
    "while the difference is only a one standard deviation effect , this contrasts with experience of previous studies that the nucleon mass tends to come out higher than experiment .",
    "in fact our results are significantly lower already at finite lattice spacings compared with previous results also shown in the figure . the discrepancy is mainly due to the bending of the nucleon mass toward small quark masses as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : extrap ] .",
    "we emphasize that our results are consistent with those from other groups in the region of strange quark .",
    "if we make a linear chiral extrapolation of the nucleon mass employing only three points of our data corresponding to @xmath46 0.75 ,  0.7 , and 0.6 , we obtain results in the chiral limit which agrees with those reported so far as illustrated in fig.[fig : nde](b ) .    for @xmath45 results from the present work and those of earlier studies overlap at finite lattice spacing .",
    "nonetheless the continuum extrapolation leads to a value about 5% larger compared to experiment in our case as compared to a value consistent with experiment reported by gf11 .",
    "figure [ fig : strangee ] shows results for strange baryons employing @xmath27 to determine the strange quark mass .",
    "we observe significant departures from the experiment except for @xmath47 .",

    "the @xmath4 meson mass is used as input both in our results and those of gf11 .",
    "it is quite conspicuous that the masses of baryons containing strange quark are systematically lower than experiment .",
    "this may be related to a similar deviation in the meson sector where the masses of @xmath31 and @xmath41 are smaller .",
    "it is interesting to note that agreement with experiment is much better if we examine the spectrum within each flavor @xmath50 multiplet .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath9 and @xmath25 to determine the lattice spacing and the strange quark mass , mass of @xmath31 is consistent with experiment , and a similar situation holds for @xmath47 and @xmath49 masses if we take the @xmath45 and @xmath48 masses instead for input .",

    "we compare results for the two definitions of quark mass . for the ward identity method we test also @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 instead of @xmath23 for replacing the time derivative which correspond to right- , left- and center - difference , respectively .",
    "for the renormalization constants @xmath12@xcite , @xmath59 and @xmath60@xcite , we employ one - loop results improved by the tadpole procedure with the coupling @xmath61 @xcitegiven by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",

    "it is not clear if wilson and kogut - susskind results agree in the continuum limit .",
    "determination of hadronic matrix elements often suffers from uncertainties in renormalization factors .",
