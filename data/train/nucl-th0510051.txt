    "bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xcite is an important tool for studying the relativistic bound state problem in a field theory framework ( see for review  @xcite ) . for a bound state with total momentum @xmath0 and in case of equal mass particles , it reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the bs amplitude , @xmath3 the interaction kernel , @xmath4 the mass of the constituents , @xmath5 their relative momentum and @xmath6 the free propagators of the constituent particles : @xmath7 we will denote by @xmath8 the total mass of the bound state , and by @xmath9 its binding energy .    the bs equation has singularities which make difficult to find its numerical solution .",
    "these singularities are due to the free propagators ( [ g0 ] ) but can also result from the interaction kernel itself . to overcome this difficulty , wick @xcite formulated the bs equation in the euclidean space , by rotating the relative energy @xmath10 in the complex plane , _",
    "i.e. _ , by introducing the variable @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to a well defined integral equation  see ( [ bs2 ] ) below  which can be solved by standard methods and provides the mass of the system . in this procedure",
    "the original bs amplitude is however lost , and the `` rotated '' one can no longer be used in calculating other physical observables , like for instance form factors .",
    "a successful attempt to calculate the bs amplitude in minkowski space for the ladder kernel was presented in @xcite .",
    "it was based on the nakanishi integral representation of the amplitude @xcite .",
    "another approach to solve bs equation with separable interaction in minkowski space was developed in  @xcite and applied to the nucleon - nucleon system . in @xcite , an equation obtained by projecting the bs equation on the light - front ( lf ) plane",
    "was studied : the lf kernel was found approximately , as an expansion in terms of the bs one and the original bs amplitude was not reconstructed from its lf projection .",
    "we present in this paper  based on our works @xcite  a new method for solving the bs equation .",
    "this method provides the bs amplitude both in minkowski and in euclidean space , depending on the value ( real or imaginary ) of the @xmath10 variable .",
    "our approach is based on a projection of the bs equation on the lf plane , and on the nakanishi integral representation @xcite of the bs amplitude .",
    "the lf projection plays the role of an integral transform which removes the singularities of the bs amplitude .",
    "the nakanishi representation results in an equation in a closed form and allows to easily restore with its solution , the original bs amplitude . the transformed equation is derived without any approximation and remains equivalent to the original bs one .",
    "our method is not restricted to the ladder kernel . for more complicated interactions , _",
    "e.g. _ cross box , calculations become more lengthy , but the additional difficulties are due to the evaluation of the feynman diagram for the kernel itself and not to the solution of the equation .    in order to present the method more distinctly",

    "one can also `` rotate '' , without crossing singularities , simultaneously all the energies @xmath56 of a perturbative feynman amplitude . however , this possibility is not evident for a bs amplitude with a kernel more complicated than the ladder one , since now not all the energies are rotated : when the relative energy @xmath10 is replaced by @xmath57 , the eigenvalue  the bound state energy @xmath58  still remains real . for the latter case ,",
