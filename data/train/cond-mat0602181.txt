    "in spite of being iso - structural and iso - valent to the cubic perovskite @xmath8k superconductor @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath4 remains in the normal metal state down to @xmath9k @xcite .",
    "the specific heat measurements indicate that the absence of superconductivity in @xmath4 may be due to a substantial decrease in the density of states at the fermi energy @xmath10 resulting from its relatively low unit cell volume in comparison with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , electronic structure calculations show that the decrease in @xmath10 is not sizable enough to make @xmath4 non - superconducting @xcite . for both @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite the density of states spectra display similar characteristics , particularly in the distribution of electronic states near the fermi energy @xmath11 .",
    "the electronic states at @xmath11 are dominated by @xmath12 @xmath13 states with a little admixture of @xmath2 @xmath14 states .",
    "there exists a strong van hove singularity - like feature just below @xmath11 , which is primarily derived from the @xmath12 @xmath13 bands .    to account for the lack of superconductivity in @xmath4",
    ", the density - functional based calculations emphasize that the material subjected to the specific heat measurements may be non - stoichiometric in the @xmath2 sub - lattice @xcite .",
    "this would then make it similar to the @xmath15 phase of @xmath5 , which has a low unit cell volume and remains non- superconducting @xcite .",
    "it has been shown earlier that exact @xmath2 content in @xmath1 depends on the nature of synthesis and other experimental conditions @xcite . according to johannes and pickett @xcite , the arguments that favor non - stoichiometry are the following : ( i ) total energy minimization en - route to equilibrium lattice constant within the local - density approximation ( lda ) finds an overestimated value for @xmath4 in comparison with the experimental values .",
    "in general , overestimation is not so common in lda .",
    "meanwhile , when one uses similar technique for @xmath5 , the calculations find a slightly underestimated value which is consistent within the limitations of the density - functional theory @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the authors also find @xmath10 in @xmath5 estimated as @xmath16 states / ry atom , while for @xmath4 , under similar approximations , it was found to be @xmath17 states / ry atom .",
    "note that it has been shown both experimentally as well as from first - principles calculations that a decrease in the lattice constant or a decrease in the @xmath2 occupancy would lead to a decrease in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "( iii ) a decrease in the unit cell dimensions can induce phonon hardening .",
    "this is well supported by the experiments which find the debye temperature approximately 1.6 times higher for @xmath4 in comparison to @xmath5@xcite .",
    "earlier synthesis of @xmath0 @xcite finds the lattice constant to be @xmath18 a.u . ,",
    "for which the occupancy in the @xmath2 sub - lattice was just @xmath19% .",
    "the authors have employed similar preparation technique for @xmath5 @xcite and have found that the @xmath2 occupancy ranges between @xmath20-@xmath21 which is consistent with the recent reports @xcite .",
    "lattice constant for @xmath4 , as high as @xmath22 a.u . has also been reported elsewhere @xcite , which then becomes consistent with the recent total energy minimized value using density - functional based methods .",
    "hence , it seems that @xmath4 which was subjected to specific heat experiments @xcite may indeed suffer from non - stoichiometry .    to understand and compare the effects of @xmath2 stoichiometry on the structural and electronic properties of @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    ", we carry out a detail study using the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green s function method @xcite formulated in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) @xcite . for disorder",
    ", we employ the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite .",
    "characterization of @xmath1 and @xmath0 with @xmath23 mainly involves the changes in the equation of state parameters viz . , the equilibrium lattice constant , bulk modulus and its pressure derivative .",
    "the electronic structure is studied with the help of total and sub - lattice resolved density of states .",
    "the propensity of magnetism in these materials is studied with the help of fixed - spin moment method @xcite in conjunction with the landau theory of phase transition @xcite .",
    "the hopfield parameter @xmath24 which generally maps the local `` chemical '' property of an atom in a crystal is also calculated as suggested by skriver and mertig @xcite , and its variation as a function of lattice constant has also been studied . in general , we find that both @xmath5 and @xmath4 display very similar electronic structure .",
    "evidences point that the non - superconducting nature of @xmath4 may be related to the crystal structure characteristics , namely phonon spectra .",
    "the ground state properties of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are calculated using the kkr - asa - cpa method of alloy theory . for improving alloy energetics ,",
    "the asa is corrected by the use of both the muffin - tin correction for the madelung energy @xcite and the multi - pole moment correction to the madelung potential and energy @xcite .",
    "these corrections have brought significant improvement in the accuracy of the total energy by taking into account the non - spherical part of polarization effects @xcite .",
    "the partial waves in the kkr - asa calculations are expanded up to @xmath25 inside atomic spheres , although the multi - pole moments of the electron density have been determined up to @xmath26 which is used for the multi - pole moment correction to the madelung energy . in general , the exchange - correlation effects are taken into consideration via the local - density approximation with perdew and wang parametrization @xcite , although a comparison in the equation of state parameters has been made in this work with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "the core states have been recalculated after each iteration .",
    "the calculations are partially scalar - relativistic in the sense that although the wave functions are non - relativistic , first order perturbation corrections to the energy eigenvalues due to the darwin and the mass - velocity terms are included .",
    "the atomic sphere radii of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath2 and @xmath12 were kept as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 of the wigner- seitz radius , respectively .",
    "the vacancies in the @xmath2 sub - lattice are modeled with the help of empty spheres , and their radius is kept same as that of @xmath2 itself .",
    "the overlap volume resulting from the blow up of the atomic spheres was less than @xmath30% , which is legitimate within the accuracy of the approximation @xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath31 can be expressed as @xmath24/@xmath32 , where @xmath24 is the hopfield parameter , expressed as the product of @xmath10 and the mean square electron - ion matrix element @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 being the ionic mass and average phonon frequency @xcite .",
    "however , one may note that the above decomposition of the problem into electronic and phonon contributions is only approximate since in principle @xmath35 is also determined by the electronic states .",
    "it follows that the hopfield parameter is the most simple basic quantity which one may obtain from first - principles as suggested by gaspari and gyorffy @xcite . the latter assumes a rigid muffin - tin approximation ( rmta ) in which the potential enclosed by a sphere rigidly moves with the ion and the change in the crystal potential , caused by the displacement , is given by the potential gradient . within the rmta the spherically averaged part of the hopfield parameter",
    "may be calculated as ,    @xmath36    where @xmath10 is the total density of state per spin at the fermi energy , and @xmath37 the @xmath38 partial density of state calculated at the fermi energy @xmath11 , on the site considered .",
    "the term @xmath39 is the electron - phonon matrix element given as @xcite ,    @xmath40    which are obtained from the gradient of the potential and the radial solutions @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the schrodinger equation evaluated at @xmath11 .",
    "the special form of the eqs.[eq-123d ] and [ eq-123 m ] stems from the asa in which the radial wave functions are normalised to unity in the atomic sphere of radius @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44=@xmath45 . in asa",
    ", @xmath46 is expressed in terms of logarithmic derivatives @xmath47=@xmath48/@xmath41 evaluated at the sphere boundary .",
    "skriver and mertig derive the expression for @xmath39 as    @xmath49\\left[d_{l+1}+l+2)\\right]+\\left[e_{f}-v(s)\\right]s^{2}\\right\\ } \\end{array}\\label{eq-234r}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the one - electron potential and @xmath51 the sphere boundary amplitude of the @xmath52 partial wave evaluated at @xmath11 .    numerical estimate to the magnetic energy are carried out using the fixed - spin - moment method @xcite . in the fixed - spin - moment method",
    "the total energy is obtained for a given magnetization @xmath34 , i.e. , by fixing the numbers of electrons with up and down spins . in this case , the fermi energies in the up and down spin bands are not equal to each other because the equilibrium condition would not be satisfied for arbitrary @xmath34 . at the equilibrium @xmath34 two fermi energies will coincide with each other . the total magnetic energy becomes minimum or maximum at this value of @xmath34 .",
    "note that the two approaches , i.e. , the self - consistent , floating - spin - moment method as well as the fixed - spin moment - method are equivalent in the sense that for a given lattice constant the magnetic moment calculated by the standard floating - spin moment approach is the same as the magnetic moment for which the fixed - spin moment total energy has its minimum @xcite . in practice",
    ", the floating - spin moment approach sometimes runs into some convergence problem . from experience , to avoid such predicaments in convergence , one may carefully monitor the mixing of the initial and final charges during the iterations and increase the number of @xmath53 points .",
    "thus , for a better resolution to determine the change in the total energy with respect to the input magnetization , the @xmath54- mesh had @xmath55 @xmath53 points in the irreducible wedge of the cubic brillouin zone .    by the fixed - spin - moment method the difference @xmath56 ( = @xmath57 ) for given values of @xmath34 is calculated .",
    "the calculated @xmath56 is fitted to the phenomenological landau equation of phase transition which is given as    @xmath58    for @xmath59 , where the sign of the coefficient @xmath60 for @xmath61 determines the nature of the magnetic ground state , i.e. , @xmath62>0 refers to a paramagnetic ground state while @xmath63 refers to a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we have applied the approach described above to the study of carbon vacancy in @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath13 transition - metal-@xmath5 alloys @xcite .",
    "both x - ray and neutron diffraction techniques unambiguously report @xmath5 and @xmath4 as cubic perovskites with their lattice constants determined as @xmath64 and @xmath65 a.u . , respectively .",
    "assuming an underlying rigid cubic lattice , with @xmath6(@xmath7 ) at cube corners , @xmath12 at the faces and @xmath2 at the octahedral interstitial site , the total energy minimization were carried out to determine the equation of state parameters .",
    "the total energies calculated , self - consistently , for six lattice constants close to equilibrium were fed as input to a third - order birch - murnaghan equation of state @xcite .",
    "note that the birch - murnaghan equation is derived from the theory of finite strain , by considering an elastic isotropic medium under isothermal compression , with the assumption that the pressure - volume relation remains linear .",
    "hence , in the optimization procedure we have restricted the choice close to the equilibrium .",
    ".[tab - zncni3mg - eos]comparison of the equation of state parameters of cubic perovskite @xmath4 with that of @xmath66 using the kkr - asa method as described in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the reported values of @xmath10 for @xmath5 are at variance with the existing reports @xcite .",
    "it appears that the value is sensitive to the basic approximations made in each type of the electronic structure method , and also to the parameters like that of the choice of wigner - seitz radii , choice of the exchange - correlation potential and others .",
    "however , under similar approximations , it is clear that for @xmath4 the @xmath10 reduces by @xmath67% in comparison with @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the earlier first - principles fp - lapw calculations @xcite .",
    "the reduction in @xmath10 may be largely due to the smaller lattice constant of @xmath4 , in comparison with @xmath5 .",
    "the change in the density of states , as well as in the @xmath10 as a function of lattice constant is shown in fig.[pressure - dos ] . approximating the variation of @xmath10 to be linear with respect to the lattice constant",
    ", we find @xmath68/@xmath69 to be @xmath70 and @xmath71 st / ry atom / a.u for @xmath5 and @xmath4 , respectively .          to understand the changes in the electronic structure upon the introduction of @xmath2 vacancies , we in figs.[cxtotdos ] , [ c2pdos ] , [ ni3ddos ] and [ c2pni3ddos ] show the changes in the total and sub - lattice resolved @xmath2 @xmath14 and @xmath12 @xmath13 partial densities of states of @xmath0 and @xmath1 alloys calculated at their equilibrium lattice constants .",
    "it follows from the figures that the change in the distribution of states is more or less insignificant near the fermi energy , but states lower in energy undergo substantial changes .    upon creation of vacancies , a few of the @xmath2 2@xmath72 - @xmath12 @xmath13 bonds break , and result in charge redistribution .",
    "note that the @xmath73 octahedral is a covalently built complex to which the cations at the cube corners ( @xmath7 and @xmath6 ) are thought to have donated their outermost valence electrons .",
    "the crystal geometry suggests six @xmath12 atoms as the first nearest neighbors to @xmath2 and eight @xmath6/@xmath7 atoms as its second nearest neighbors . for @xmath12",
    "the second nearest coordination shell carries four @xmath6/@xmath7 atoms .",
    "the charge redistribution arising due to the breaking of the @xmath72-@xmath74 bonds would be proportional to the electro - positivity of the cation- @xmath6/@xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath6 is more electro - positive than @xmath7 , charge redistribution to the @xmath6/@xmath7 sub - lattices , as a function of vacancies would be more significant in @xmath5 when compared to @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a larger fraction of the charge would be transferred back to the @xmath6 sub - lattice , in @xmath5 in comparison with that of the @xmath12 sub - lattice .",
    "the change in the @xmath10 as a function of lattice constant in @xmath75 alloys is shown in fig.[znxmg - latdos ] .",
    "one may find that @xmath10 decreases for all values of @xmath76 , with respect to lattice constant .",
    "however , @xmath10 as a function of @xmath76 , at the equilibrium lattice constant , was found to deviate a little , as is evident from fig.[znxmg - latdos ] .",
    "this clearly suggests that the electronic structure properties are mainly governed by the @xmath73 octahedra .",
    "the atoms occupying the cube corners i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , however , play a non - trivial role in determining the structural properties .",
    "the hopfield parameter @xmath24 has been regarded as a local `` chemical '' property of an atom in a crystal .",
    "it has been emphasized earlier that the most significant single parameter in understanding the @xmath77 of a conventional superconductor is the hopfield parameter @xcite . for strong - coupling systems ,",
    "the variation in @xmath24 is more important than the variation of @xmath35 in changing @xmath77 .",
    "softening @xmath35 often does enhance @xmath77 , but a significant change in the magnitude of @xmath77 depends largely on a significant change in the @xmath24 value rather than a small change in the corresponding @xmath35 . as a matter of fact , we look for the changes in the @xmath24 from the three sub - lattices of these perovskites as a function of lattice constant as well as @xmath78 in @xmath1 and @xmath0 alloys .",
    "note that for @xmath5 , it has been reported that the superconducting transition temperature @xmath77 increases upon application of external pressure @xcite .",
    "besides , experiments remain controversial on the strength of the electron - phonon interaction in @xmath5 @xcite . it has been suggested that @xmath5 may be a strongly - coupled superconductor , however , the magnitude of @xmath77 being marginally reduced due to the paramagnon interactions @xcite .                in fig.[hopeta ]",
    "we show the changes in the @xmath24 of @xmath5 and @xmath4 as a function of lattice constant .",
    "it is clear from fig.[hopeta ] that the @xmath79 and @xmath80 linearly increase as a function of decreasing volume in either alloys . if the change in the average phonon frequency remains small , then either of these alloys could enhance the transition temperature with respect to external pressure . for @xmath5",
    "this view is consistent with the previous experimental results .",
    "similar characteristic feature holds for the vacancy - rich disordered alloys , the variation of which is shown in fig.[mgcxeta00 ] and [ zncxeta00 ]                to have an understanding in the variation of @xmath79 , @xmath81 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 can be considered as the local chemical property of the electrons in the empty sphere , we show in fig.[cxeta ] the change in these parameters as a function of @xmath78 in both @xmath1 and @xmath0 alloys .",
    "one may find that the variation of @xmath24 remains similar for both the alloys as a function of decreasing @xmath2 content .",
    "total energies from both the self - consistent , spin polarized and spin unpolarized calculations remain degenerate for @xmath5 and @xmath4 alloys at their equilibrium lattice constants .",
    "this unambiguously shows that the materials are non - magnetic in nature .",
    "however , having suggested that @xmath5 is on the verge of a ferromagnetic instability @xcite , and also that incipient magnetism in the form of spin - fluctuations reside in the material , we attempt to compare the magnetic properties of @xmath5 and @xmath4 alloys using the fixed - spin moment approach of alloy theory @xcite .          numerical calculations of magnetic energy @xmath56 for @xmath5 and @xmath4 are carried out at over a range of lattice constants .",
    "the calculated results of @xmath56 in the fixed - spin - moment method are shown in fig.[fsm - de ] .",
    "the calculated @xmath56 curves are fit to the form of a power series of @xmath82 up to @xmath59 , for the polynomial as mentioned above .",
    "the variations of the coefficients , @xmath62 in units of @xmath83 , @xmath84 in @xmath85 , and @xmath86 in @xmath87 as a function of lattice constant are shown in fig.[fsm - coeff ] .",
    "the propensity of magnetism can be inferred from the sign of the coefficient which is quadratic in @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath62 is the measure of the curvature and is positive definite when the total energy minimum is at @xmath88 , thus referring to a paramagnetic ground state . in general ,",
    "when @xmath62 becomes negative , it infers that there would exist a minimum in the @xmath89 curve at a value other than @xmath88 referring to a ferromagnetic phase at that value of @xmath34 .",
    "the higher - order coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath86 however are significant and they control the variation of @xmath90 with respect to @xmath34 . for example , for larger values of @xmath34 , @xmath84 and successively @xmath86 would dominate , and if @xmath84(@xmath86 ) tends to be negative it would show a dip in the @xmath89 variation pointing towards a magnetic transition at a higher value of @xmath34 .",
    "this , in the first - principles characterization of the magnetic properties of a material would refer to a possibility of a metastable phase at relatively large values of external magnetic fields .",
    "however , it has to be noted that calculations for large values of @xmath34 can result in ambiguous results .",
    "hence , it is suggested to carry out calculations for smaller values of @xmath34 and use the above mentioned polynomial function up to the minimum order , where the curve fits with sufficient accuracy .",
    "[ fsm - coeff ] shows that for smaller values of lattice constant , the alloys show an enhanced paramagnetic character .",
    "one may also note that the variation in @xmath84 and @xmath86 coefficients are oppositely complimented and hence in the renormalized approach to include corrections due to spin - fluctuations , as suggested by yamada and terao @xcite , they would cancel out in proportion preserving the trend in the variation of @xmath62 .",
    "thus , it becomes likely that the incipient magnetic properties associated with @xmath5 and @xmath4 would decrease as a function of decreasing lattice constant .",
    "first - principles syudy of the electronic properties of @xmath5 and @xmath4 , and also their non - stoichiometric alloys are carried out using the density - functional - based kkr - asa method .",
    "we find that the lattice constant for @xmath4 is overestimated , while for @xmath5 it is underestimated .",
    "this suggests that the material @xmath4 subjected to experiments may be non - stoichiometric . as a function of decreasing @xmath2 content in @xmath1 and @xmath0 alloys",
    ", one finds an opposite trend in the variation of pressure derivative of the bulk modulus , which is proportional to the averaged phonon frequency . with electronic structure remaining essentially the same for @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the results hint that non - stoichiometry may have opposite effects .",
    "note that for @xmath91 , @xmath1 alloys are feebly superconducting , while according to the conjecture that has been made @xmath0 is not .",
    "it can thus be inferred that the associated phonon modes in @xmath4 and its disordered alloys may be characteristically different when compared to the @xmath5 counterparts .",
    "a comparison of the phonon spectra of these alloys thus become quite necessary to understand the absence of superconductivity in @xmath4 , although it is iso - structural and iso - valent with @xmath5 .",

    "<S> first - principles , density - functional - based electronic structure calculations are employed to study the changes in the electronic properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the korringa - kohn - rostoker coherent - potential approximation method in the atomic sphere approximation ( kkr - asa cpa ) . as a function of decreasing @xmath2 @xmath3% </S>",
    "<S> , we find a steady decrease in the lattice constant and bulk modulus in either alloys . </S>",
    "<S> however , the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus displays an opposite trend . </S>",
    "<S> following the debye model , which relates the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus with the average phonon frequency of the crystal , it can thus be argued that @xmath4 and its disordered alloys posses a different phonon spectra in comparison to its @xmath5 counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> this is further justified by the marked similarity we find in the electronic structure properties such as the variation in the density of states and the hopfield parameters calculated for these alloys . </S>",
    "<S> the effects on the equation of state parameters and the density of states at the fermi energy , for partial replacement of @xmath6 by @xmath7 are also discussed . </S>"
