    "the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance in doped manganites@xcite has renewed interest in the ferromagnetism induced by the double - exchange ( de ) mechanism.@xcite the main feature of the de mechanism is a cooperative effect where electron hoping favors ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering of localized spins via the fm hund coupling , and vice versa , the presence of the fm order facilitates the electron hoping .",
    "the occurrence of metallic fm state in doped manganites r@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( where r is a trivalent rare - earth element and a is a divalent alkaline ion ) was qualitatively explained by the de mechanism.@xcite the physically relevant electrons in these compounds are those from mn @xmath3 levels which are split by the cubic crystalline field into triply degenerate @xmath4 levels and doubly degenerate @xmath5 levels .",
    "electrons of @xmath5 levels are able to hop between mn sites and form the conduction band , while electrons of @xmath4 levels are localized . conduction electrons and localized spins are correlated by the de mechanism which leads to the appearance of the metallic fm phase .",
    "the de model became the starting point toward comprehensive understanding of the properties of doped manganites .",
    "experiments have observed in doped manganites a very rich phase diagram , which involves phases with spin , charge and orbital orders.@xcite for the undoped case ( @xmath6 ) all mn ions are mn@xmath7 and are expected to induce a jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion . for the other extreme doping ( @xmath8 )",
    "all mn ions are mn@xmath9 and do not couple to the jt distortion . in the regime of intermediate doping , two valence ions mn@xmath7 and mn@xmath9 are simultaneously present .",
    "the presence of two valence ions may lead to a static mixed valence mn@xmath7/mn@xmath9 configuration , in particular , to an alternation charge - ordered ( co ) state of mn@xmath7/mn@xmath9 ions for appropriate dopings .",
    "this is the conventional view , for which there are abundant experimental and theoretical supports.@xcite in particular , recently a co - fm state has been observed.@xcite however , there are several experiments which challenge the conventional view .",
    "several x - ray absorption@xcite and neutron diffraction studies@xcite revealed pictures that do not match with the static mixture of mn@xmath7 and mn@xmath9 ions .",
    "one suggests that all mn ions have the same valence and result into the zener - polaron state.@xcite however , very recent experiment@xcite observed the presence of two types of mn sites with different local geometric structures .",
    "one of the types of mn sites is surrounded by a tetragonal - distorted oxygen octahedron , whereas the other has a regular octahedral environment . as a result",
    "a charge segregation state was deduced . with the motivation of the experimental observations@xcite we model the presence of the two types of mn sites by incorporating the falicov - kimball ( fk ) model.@xcite",
    "the fk model was initially introduced as a statistical model for metal - insulator transition.@xcite later it was also applied to valence change transitions in intermetallic compounds.@xcite within the fk model the presence of two types of mn sites is mapped to a classical variable which only accept two values ( for instance , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the energy difference of these sites is mapped into the interaction strength of the fk model .",
    "indeed , the sites surrounded by tetragonal - distorted octahedron have induced the jt distortion . as a consequence",
    "the energy levels of the distorted mn sites are split .",
    "the fk model can describe a charge ordered phase as well as a charge segregated phase.@xcite in particular , the model can exhibit the checkerboard co state in appropriate conditions .",
    "the checkerboard co state is truly a mixed - valence state .",
    "the segregated state is a phase - separated mixture of two full uniform configurations.@xcite in such the way , at low temperature the fk model could establish various phases with different charge configurations which may correspond to the experimental observations.@xcite    however , the fk model alone can not describe the de induced fm state which was also observed in doped manganites .",
    "therefore we incorporate the fk model into the de model in order to study both the charge ordered phases and the ferromagnetism upon doping .",
    "the combined model has previously been considered in the context of order - disorder change of the a - site substitution.@xcite in the previous study@xcite only the checkerboard co and fm state are considered in the limit of infinite value of the hund coupling . in this paper",
    "we study all possible ordered phases of the combined model in whole range of doping and interaction . in order to detect the phase transition we study the static charge and spin response of system within the dynamical - mean field theory ( dmft).@xcite",
    "the dmft has been widely used for investigating strongly correlated electron systems . within the dmft",
    "the static charge and spin correlation function are calculated explicitly .",
    "we find that the system exhibits a rich phase diagram which includes various charge ordered phases coexisting with ferromagnetism .",
    "in particular , the checkerboard co state or the segregated state can coexist with the fm state .",
    "the combined model can also serve as a model for studying the problem of order - disorder a - site substitution @xcite or the problem of orbital ordering in doped manganites.@xcite    the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "the expectation value @xmath27 , ( @xmath28 is the number of lattice sites ) , corresponds to the concentration of distorted sites .",

    "the first three terms in hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) describe a simplified de model which contains only the ising - type interaction between the itinerant and localized electron spins .",
    "the simplification does not allow any spin - flip processes , which can be important at low temperature where spin - wave excitations may govern the thermodynamics of the system .",
    "however , in the de processes spins of itinerant electrons align ferromagnetically with the localized spins , hence the ising part of the hund coupling plays a dominant role . within the dmft",
    "the simplified de model is equivalent to the de model with classical localized spins in the disordered paramagnetic phase.@xcite the transport quantities calculated within the simplified model capture essential features of the full de model.@xcite the simplified de model has also previously been used in the study of doped manganites .",
    "@xcite the last two terms in hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) take into account the energy difference of mn sites .",

    "the divergence of the spin correlation function at @xmath108 indicates the fm stability .",
    "this means the fm state is established at low temperature .",
    "however for small values of @xmath111 and @xmath63 closed to 1 , the spin correlation function also diverges at @xmath106.@xcite this divergence indicates the stability of the antiferromagnetic phase at low temperature . in this paper",
    "we only consider the fm phase induced by the de mechanism and its coexistence with co phases .",
    "thus in the rest of paper we consider the fm stability only .    in fig .",

    "2(a ) shows that the critical temperature @xmath112 decreases as increasing @xmath26 and increases as increasing @xmath111 .",
    "one expects in the limit @xmath113 the fm transition temperature reaches its maximum value for fixed @xmath26 . for fixed @xmath111",
    "the fm transition temperature is maximum if there is no jt distortion ( i.e. @xmath114 ) .",
    "the jt distortion splits the energy level of mn ions , and this leads to suppress the fm transition temperature .",
    "this reduction of the fm transition temperature due to distortion is gradually significant already at intermediate values of @xmath26 . in figure 2(b ) we also present the fm transition temperature as a function of doping @xmath63 . in the limit @xmath115 , the fm transition temperature is maximum at half doping @xmath116.@xcite however , for finite @xmath111 its maximum shifts away from the half doping , to lower doping region .",
    "next , we consider the charge ordering instability . in this case",
    ", we study the divergence of the charge correlation function in the homogeneous paramagnetic phase .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the typical behaviors of the charge correlation function .",
    "they show that the charge correlation function may diverge at @xmath108 , @xmath106 or at an intermediate value @xmath117 .",

    "the divergence at an intermediate value of @xmath105 indicates the charge ordered phase being incommensurate at low temperature .",
    "the charge ordering critical temperature @xmath118 is determined from the vanishing condition of the determinant of @xmath104 .",
    "however , one notices that for fixed values of @xmath111 , @xmath26 and @xmath63 the determinant of @xmath104 may vanish at different @xmath105 and temperature @xmath110 .",
    "hence , we obtain the critical temperature @xmath119 as a function of @xmath105",
    ". however , this does not indicate the stability of many charge ordered phases at low temperature . for certain values of @xmath111 , @xmath26 and @xmath63",
    "there is only one charge ordering transition which happens at the maximum temperature @xmath118 among @xmath119 .",
    "below this temperature @xmath118 , although the charge correlation function may still diverge at other values of @xmath105 , the divergence does not indicate a charge ordering , because the assumption of disordered phase is not valid anymore .",
    "therefore the charge ordering critical temperature is determined not only from the vanishing condition of the determinant of @xmath104 , but also from the maximum condition@xcite @xmath120    the corresponding value of @xmath105 at which @xmath119 is maximum determines the charge arrangement of the low temperature phase . in fig .",
    "4 we plot function @xmath119 for different values of @xmath111 .",
    "it shows that for fixed @xmath111 , @xmath26 , @xmath63 we always find a unique maximum @xmath118 . for small values of @xmath111",
    "we obtain the segregated state at low temperature . for large values of @xmath111",
    "the checkerboard ordered phase is observed . in an intermediate regime",
    "we also find an incommensurate charge ordering phase transition . in fig .",
    "5 we plot the charge ordering critical temperature as a function of @xmath26 for various values of @xmath111 .",
    "it shows that the checkerboard ordered phase is established for large values of @xmath111 . as increasing @xmath26 ,",
    "the critical temperature first increases , reaches a maximum value , and then decreases .",
    "the behavior of the critical temperature is similar to the one obtained in the fk model.@xcite for small values of @xmath111 the checkerboard co phase disappears and the segregated phase or incommensurate co phase may be established depending on the value of @xmath26 , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . figure .",
    "5 also shows that the segregated phase is established at large values of @xmath26 , while the incommensurate phase is established at smaller values of @xmath26 .",
    "one notices that the segregated phase detected from the divergence of the charge correlation function constitutes a continuous phase transition . however , the phase transition is indeed first order.@xcite it can be shown by considering the free energy and using a maxwell construction at low temperature .",
    "@xcite usually , the critical temperature of the first order phase transition is higher than the one obtained from the divergence of the charge correlation function.@xcite    in fig .",
    "6 we plot the critical temperature @xmath118 as a function of @xmath111 for various doping @xmath63 .",
    "it shows that the checkerboard charge ordered phase is established at large values of @xmath111 and disappears at small @xmath111 .",
    "its critical temperature increases as increasing @xmath111 .",
    "in contrast , the segregated phase is established at small values of @xmath111 and its critical temperature decreases as increasing @xmath111 . for intermediate values of @xmath111 , both the checkerboard co and segregated phases disappear , and an incommensurate co phase is established . in fig .",
    "7 we plot the critical temperature @xmath118 as a function of doping @xmath63 for various values of @xmath111 . for large values of @xmath111",
    "the checkerboard co phase is established , and its critical temperature reaches maximum at half doping @xmath116 . for intermediate values of @xmath111 ,",
    "the co phase is established at large doping @xmath121 , and disappears at smaller doping . instead of the checkerboard co phase , an incommensurate phase appears . for small values of @xmath111",
    "only the segregated phase appears at small doping . at large doping",
    "the segregated phase also disappears .",
    "we summarize the above results with the phase diagram in fig .",
    "8 which plots the regions of stability for different charge ordered phases .",
    "the stability is determined by the symmetry label @xmath105 of the initial ordered phase as the temperature is lowered to the first instability at @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the symmetry label @xmath105 of the ordered phase does not change as the temperature lowered from @xmath118 to zero . actually , the phase diagram is an approximation of the zero temperature phase diagram.@xcite the phase boundaries may change as one reduces the temperature from @xmath118 to zero since the behaviors of incommensurate phases at low temperature are not able to be studied within the present approach .",
    "moreover , the phase boundaries may also change if there are first - order phase transitions which may happen with the segregation phases .",
    "the phase diagram shows that the incommensurate phases is stabilized in buffer zones between the disordered and checkerboard co phase or between the disordered and segregated phase .",
    "the segregated phase exists only for small values of @xmath111 . for large values of @xmath111 the checkerboard co phase is stabilized .",
    "so far , we have obtained different charge ordered phases depending on the value of @xmath111 , @xmath26 and doping @xmath63 . on the other hand , the system always exhibits the fm stability .",
    "although the fm transition may happen first , in the fm phase the charge density still remains homogeneous and the charge correlation function is still normal as in the homogeneous paramagnetic phase .",
    "hence one can use the charge instability signal in the high temperature homogeneous phase as the signal of charge ordering even if the system is already in the fm phase .",
    "indeed , the charge ordering critical temperature detected from the charge order parameter in the co - fm state coincides with the one calculated from the instability of the charge correlation function in the homogeneous paramagnetic phase.@xcite in such the way , the fm state coexists with different charge ordered phases for appropriate doping and distortion .",
    "one notices that in the previous studies@xcite a rich phase diagram which includes spin , charge and orbital ordered phases was also obtained .",
    "there is also a coexistence of the fm phase with checkerboard co phase due to the jahn - teller phonons.@xcite in particular , the ferromagnetic co phase is stabilized for large jahn - teller coupling and infinite hund coupling .",
    "the conditions are in an agreement with the phase diagram in fig .",
    "however , in the previous studies@xcite only a phase separation between different magnetic phases was considered .",
    "a separation of charge ordered phases has not been addressed . in the present paper ,",
    "a charge segregated phase coexisting with the fm phase is obtained theoretically .",
    "the phase is a phase separated mixture of two types of mn sites with different local geometric structures .",
    "the regime of the phase separation is particularly interesting , and possible consequences of its existence may be relevant to the experimental observations.@xcite however , the segregated phase appears only for weak hund coupling and strong distortion .",
    "there is also a possible coexistence of the two segregated phases , one of which is between the magnetic phases , and the other is between the charge ordered phases .",
    "however , we leave the problem for further study .",
    "in the present paper we have considered the doping and distortion effect on the double - exchange ferromagnetism . by employing the dmft",
    "we have exactly calculated the charge and spin correlation function .",
    "a long range order is determined from the divergence signal of the correlation functions .",
    "the obtained results show that the system exhibits various phases which include the fm , checkerboard co , incommensurate co and segregated phases",
    ". in particular , the fm phase can coexist with the checkerboard co phase for large values of @xmath111 and with the segregated phase for small values of @xmath111 .",
    "the incommensurate phases appear in the buffer zones between the regions of the charge ordered phases with different symmetries .",
    "it is interesting to note that experiments have observed both the co - fm state@xcite and charge segregated phase.@xcite the phase separation between different charge ordered phases is a novel regime in manganites . by including the distortion effect in manganites via the falicov - kimball interaction",
    "we have simulated the charge segregated phase .",
    "the phase diagrams were found to clearly distinguish regions with robust co - fm correlations and charge phase separation .",
    "however , manganites are too complicated of a system to be completely described by this simple model . in particular",
    ", experiments have observed inhomogeneous regions with different long - range orders.@xcite the study of the properties is beyond the capacity of the present method .",
