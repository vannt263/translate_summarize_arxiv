    "<S> sv were produced in parametric down conversion , followed by mode filtering . </S>",
    "<S> improvement of this experiment requires the creation of fock states . </S>",
    "<S> they could be conditionally prepared from two - mode sv states , which posses perfect photon - number correlations between the modes ( the signal and idler ) . </S>",
    "<S> the idler would be measured by a photon counting detector , whereas the signal would end up in a known fock state . for the hom ql </S>",
    "<S> , one would need two such sources and detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the range of @xmath76 would match best superconducting transition - edge sensors ( tess )  @xcite with photon - counting efficiencies near @xmath77 and well - resolved photon - number peaks up to around ten photons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a bs of a controllable reflectivity can be implemented by a mach - zehnder interferometer with a dynamically controlled phase shift applied to one of the inputs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unbalancedqw ] for @xmath76 is shown in the supplementary material ) .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions . _ </S>",
    "<S> quantum leaps may be an important concept in the framework of quantum simulations . </S>",
    "<S> they quickly restore long evolution by mapping physical time to a controllable parameter of a setup while preserving an original hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this is appealing for simulation of processes requiring dynamical control , e.g. transport in presence of dynamical disorder , using passive setups .    </S>",
    "<S> the hom interference of many indistinguishable particles provides a link between a walk of a quantum nature ( useful for quantum tasks ) and a ql . </S>",
    "<S> it is characterized by the second - order visibility , which for two identical fock states impinging on a symmetric bs is quantum @xmath78 and can not be explained within classical theory ( the case of two non - identical fock states is discussed in the supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it imparts an effective nonlinearity leading to the exchange interaction between photons at a bs  @xcite . up to date , </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear effects and interacting bosons have not been explored in photonic quantum walks . </S>",
    "<S> importance of generalized hom effects for practical purposes has been recognized  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> combining the hom interference with a standard qw architecture will constitute setup enabling observation of large - scale interference , boson sampling  @xcite , multi - particle entanglement and non - linear phenomena  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the hom ql reproduces the statistics of a ctqw allowing perfect state transfer over spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> its variance is set by reflectivity of the hom bs and reveals ballistic spread . </S>",
    "<S> it replicates quantum - to - classical transition triggered by partial distinguishability of particles and establishes a link between the fundamental indistinguishability of quantum particles and the wavelike coherent nature of the walk . </S>",
    "<S> we have discussed one - dimensional hom ql but by exploiting various degrees of freedom , the scheme may be generalized to higher dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> implementations of qws without interferometers are gaining a lot of interest now  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach represents a substantial saving in elements and detectors  we reduce the complexity of the system to having a single bs , two detectors and @xmath0 particles to implement a ctqw with @xmath1 positions . </S>",
    "<S> this allows control of decoherence during the evolution , by shifting it to the initial state preparation and detection scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> we have discussed the feasibility of hom qls with optical lattices , becs and optical systems . </S>",
    "<S> our insights are of a general relevance and apply to a broad class of bosons : diffracting neutron  @xcite and x rays  @xcite , surface plasmon polaritons  @xcite , and fermions  @xcite where the hom - like effects were observed .    </S>",
    "<S> our results lead to open problems . </S>",
    "<S> is it possible to find interferometers giving qws with arbitrary jump amplitudes ? </S>",
    "<S> one can consider e.g. qws with interacting becs or atoms in optical lattices with larger particle numbers per lattice site , leading to generalization of the results presented in  @xcite and  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> how does the interaction influence the dynamics of the walk and the observed probability distribution ? </S>",
    "<S> what classes of hamiltonians can be simulated with passive interferometers , perhaps including complex input states ? in this case , a single step of a ql would be understood as a direct mapping of the input to the output state . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate operations implemented in such setup would not necessarily correspond to successive steps of evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this work will establish a new approach to quantum simulations and to bottom - up study of the dynamics of complex systems .    _ </S>",
