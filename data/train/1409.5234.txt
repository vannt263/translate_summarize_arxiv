    "recent research has revealed that the blazhko effect @xcite , which manifests itself as amplitude and/or phase changes in light curves of rr lyrae type stars , is much more common than astronomers previously thought .",
    "owing to ultra - precise space measurements provided by the _ kepler _ and _ corot _ satellites and extensive ground - based surveys ( e.g. _ the konkoly blazhko survey _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it became apparent that the fraction of field rr lyrae stars pulsating in fundamental mode , which undergo the blazhko modulation , exceeds @xmath2 @xcite . although these incidence rates are based on relatively small samples comprising only few tens of stars , the close to one half incidence of modulated stars could generally be correct .    in the first paper , which was devoted to bright rrab stars observed in the framework of the asas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and wasp @xcite surveys , @xcite showed with a sample of more than three hundred stars that the incidence rate of bright field blazhko rrab lyraes is at least 31% , which is much higher than previously presented by @xcite ( 5.1% , based on asas data ) or @xcite , who proposed the fraction of blazhko rr lyrae stars based on nsvs @xcite data as 4.1% .",
    "concerning globular clusters , the situation is very similar .",
    "@xcite found that one half of the rrab stars in m3 show modulation . in m5",
    "the fraction of modulated stars is about 40% @xcite .",
    "incidences of 20% , 22% and 30% hold for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , small magellanic cloud ( smc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and galactic bulge ( gb , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , respectively .",
    "evidently , understanding the blazhko effect is of great importance . for the explanation of this phenomenon",
    "several models have been proposed . among others",
    "we can mention _ the magnetic model _",
    "@xcite , _ resonance model _",
    "@xcite , _ variable turbulent convection model",
    "_ @xcite , which are more or less outdated , and new models , which were recently proposed : _ shock wave model _",
    "@xcite , _ starspot mechanism _",
    "@xcite or _ a hybrid model _",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , the most commonly quoted model for explaining the blazhko effect is _ the radial resonance model _",
    "@xcite , which involves resonant interaction ( 9:2 ) between the fundamental and 9th overtone .    except",
    "that it is unclear how the modulation should be modelled , there are two crucial questions unanswered : why do some stars show modulation and other do not ? is there any difference between blazhko and non - blazhko stars ?",
    "there are a few studies dealing mainly with the metallicity dependence of the blazhko effect , such as the one by @xcite , who suggested that the incidence rate of blazhko stars could correlate with metallicity . however , a paper that broadly deals with other physical characteristics has been missing in spite of the availability of a large sample of regular and modulated field rrab stars .",
    "nevertheless , we should mention the study of @xcite , who disproved the formerly noted suggestion of @xcite and gave plots for several interrelations among fourier parameters of gb and lmc stars .",
    "@xcite extensively compared stable and blazko stars ( also in their fourier parameters ) in the lmc .",
    "more recently , @xcite gave a wide review of empirical relations which they applied to stars in the field of view of the _ kepler _ space telescope and compared them with their spectroscopic results @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that blazhko rrab stars in m5 tend to have systematically larger amplitudes of light changes , shorter periods and fainter magnitudes than the averages of their sample stars .",
    "in addition they showed that blazhko rrab lyraes are bluer than regular stars and speculated that the blazhko effect may have an evolutionary connection with the mode switch from fundamental to overtone - mode pulsation .",
    "@xcite reported that v79 in m3 shares the properties of both the double - mode and the blazhko phenomena .",
    "similar behaviour was observed in ogle - blg - rrlyr-12245 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a very interesting stable star in the globular cluster m3 , which mimics the behaviour of a blazhko star .",
    "these objects could play an important role in understanding the nature of the blazhko effect .    in this paper",

    "[ summarysection ] is a summary of this paper .",
    "the crucial part of our analysis , focused on stars from the galactic field , is based on data from the wasp and asas databases . as an extension we also compiled and utilized available data of stars from globular clusters ( hereafter gc ) , the lmc , smc and gb and compared their light - curve parameters with those from our basic data set .",
    "we examined the data of 321 rrab lyraes from the asas and wasp surveys .",
    "these stars have well defined light curves brighter than 12.5mag in maximum light .",
    "this analysis is a continuation of the study of blazhko variables performed on the same sample @xcite .",
    "after additional visual examination , we discarded stars with sparse and uneven light curves and stars in which we could not decide about modulation . that left us with 268 objects ( 176 stable stars , 92 blazhko stars ) .",
    "from this sample , 99 stars had high - density , high - precision data in the wasp survey containing typically few thousands of points per star , which span from several tens of days to about three years .",
    "compared to asas light curves , which had typically only few hundreds of points spread out over several years , wasp data were of significantly better quality with a magnitude - order lower scatter than asas light curves .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for more details about the data , methods in data cleaning , data processing and period determination , as well as for methods to identify the blazhko effect .",
    "the goal of the light - curve analysis was to determine fourier parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 via light - curve fitting with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the degree of the fit , @xmath7 is a time of maximum light and @xmath8 is the basic pulsation period .",
    "fourier parameters , which were firstly introduced to analyse light - curve properties of cepheids @xcite , can be easily converted to physical characteristics through known empirical relations ( sec .",

    "nevertheless , in several tens of stars , the degree of the fit was changed by visual inspection to get a better model of the light curve .",
    "noted conditions were used to avoid over - fitting of noisy light curves and under - fitting of well defined ones as was already discussed in k05 . in the case of wasp data ,",
    "data were always fitted with ten components . since wasp data were more dense and more numerous than those from asas , uncertainties of parameters based on wasp data were in the order of a few thousandths , while uncertainties of parameters derived from asas data were of a magnitude larger .      the vast majority of relationships between fourier parameters and physical characteristics ( sec .",

    "asas measurements are in the @xmath21 filter , and offsets of light - curve parameters from asas and those based on the standard @xmath21 johnson filter are known ( table 3 in k05 ) .",
    "since we utilized only data from wasp and asas , the consistency between parameters from these two surveys was more important than precise calibration to the standard johnsons @xmath21",
    "thus we decided to transform wasp broad - band light - curve parameters onto asas using 24 stars in common .",
    "subsequently , values were shifted using kovacs offsets .    when we compared wasp fourier coefficients with those from asas , it was found that offsets are very scattered ( examples in fig .",
    "[ offsetsfig ] ) .",

    "it appears that 1/3 of stars ( @xmath36 ) can be clearly separated from stable stars .",

    "this means that @xmath35 can also be used for metallicity determination @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath35-metallicity equation can be used only for modulation - free stars , because blazhko stars do not behave linearly and results for these stars would be completely wrong or at least systematically shifted .    in table",

    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that slightly different or additional physics occurs inside blazhko stars . in such case , although blazhko and stable stars would share the same physical parameters , their light - curve parameters would be different . since at this moment no signs of different physics are apparent , we assume that different light - curve parameters mean different physical parameters .      the period - range of our 268 sample stars is between 0.27 and 0.89days , which is also the range for our regular rr lyrae stars",

    "in addition the reanalysis of lmc stars ( comprising new measurements since 2003 ) could shed some light on this matter .          when thinking about differences between modulated and modulation - free stars , metallicity is one of the most suspect parameters .",
    "@xcite assumed modulated stars in the gb to show a preference for higher metallicity , which was later disproved by @xcite , who found that the occurrence of blazhko stars is metallicity - independent .",

    "<S> in this article , we present results based on high - density , high - precision wide - angle search for planets ( wasp ) light curves supplemented with lower - precision photometry from the all - sky automated survey ( asas ) for 268 rr lyrae stars ( 176 regular , 92 blazhko ) . </S>",
    "<S> light curves were fourier - decomposed and coefficients from wasp were transformed to the asas standard using 24 common stars . </S>",
    "<S> coefficients were then compared with similar data from galactic globular clusters , the galactic bulge and the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) . </S>",
    "<S> using fourier coefficients , we also calculated physical parameters via standard equations from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed the results of previous authors , including lower amplitudes and longer rise times for blazhko stars . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 plot the location of a star depends mainly on its metallicity and that blazhko stars prefer a different location than modulation - free stars . </S>",
    "<S> field and globular - cluster rr  lyrae variables have a different 1f and 1f than stars in the lmc , smc and in galactic bulge . </S>",
    "<S> although there are some weak indications that blazhko stars could prefer a slightly lower metallicity and shorter periods , no convincing proof was found . </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting highlight is the identification of a very recently proposed new group of metal - rich rr  lyrae type stars . </S>",
    "<S> these low - luminous , metal - strong variables , which comprise both blazhko and regular stars , have shorter periods and about a 180k higher temperature at constant  than the rest of the stars in the sample .    [ firstpage ]    </S>",
