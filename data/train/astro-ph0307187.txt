    "the study of globular cluster binaries is motivated by their profound impact on the dynamical evolution of globular clusters ( hut et al .",
    "stellar densities near the centers of globular clusters can reach values as high as 10@xmath5 stars per cubic parsec , and in these extreme conditions interactions and collisions between single and binary stars become inevitable ( hurley & shara 2002 ) .",
    "these interactions can act as a heating source by the conversion of binary binding energy into stellar kinetic energy when , for example , low - mass stars are ejected after binary collisions , helping to stall or prevent core collapse .",
    "realistic models of globular cluster evolution therefore require knowledge of their binary star populations .",
    "one of the most powerful ways to search for binaries in globular clusters is by studying their x - ray source population . the bright ( @xmath6  @xmath7 erg  s@xmath8 ) x",
    "- ray sources in globular clusters have already been identified with low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; grindlay et al .",
    "1984 ) and the fainter sources ( @xmath6  @xmath9 erg  s@xmath8 ) have long been thought to contain a mixture of lmxbs in quiescence ( qlmxbs ) and cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; hertz & grindlay 1983 , verbunt & hasinger 1998 ) . however , secure optical identifications were rare because of the severe crowding found near the centers of clusters .",
    "this problem is exacerbated by mass segregation , which causes relatively heavy objects like binaries to sink towards the centers of clusters , where the crowding is at its worst . because of",
    "these problems , only the brightest binaries in rich globular clusters like 47  tucanae were discovered with x - ray missions like _ einstein _ and rosat .",
    "these resolution limitations have been dramatically overcome by the use of the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory .",
    "rich samples of x - ray sources have been reported in the globular clusters 47  tuc ( grindlay et al . 2001a ; hereafter ghe01a ) , ngc  6397 ( grindlay et al . 2001b ; hereafter ghe01b ) , ngc  6752 ( pooley et al . 2002a ) , ngc  6440 ( pooley et al . 2002b ) and @xmath10 centauri ( rutledge et al . 2002 ; cool , haggard , & carlin 2002 ) . the sample in the massive globular cluster 47  tuc is by far the largest , with over 100 sources detected in a 2@xmath11 2.5  field centered on the cluster ( ghe01a ) , and close to 200 sources detected out to a radius of 4  ( grindlay et al . 2002 ) .",

    "there were several cv candidates where the psf - fit quality in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands exceeded our threshold and/or the position of the fitted star was more than 2 pixels away from the @xmath2 band position ( w15@xmath35 , w33@xmath35 , w45@xmath35 , w70@xmath35 ) . here , @xmath0 magnitude estimates were performed by iteratively using addstar to subtract psf models of the star in the @xmath0 image until the residuals were minimized .",

    "the only difference in the analysis technique was that the deep oversampled images were created using the suite of drizzle routines ( hook , pirzkal , & fruchter 1999 ) available in stsdas ( these are designed to handle cosmic - ray removal with sparsely dithered data , unlike our customized software used for the go-8267 analysis ) .",

    "was applied to both the f300w and f555w images using daophot programs . after applying a plate solution ( using bright , relatively isolated stars used to build the psf model ) to transform the f555w coordinate frame to that of the f300w frame ,",
    "stars @xmath36 oversampled pixels apart in the two filters were considered detected in each .",
    "extra filtering of the results was performed by eliminating stars with chi - squared values @xmath37 and with ` sharpness ' values @xmath38 in the allstar output .",

    "this blue star is almost certainly a he  wd and shows small amplitude orbital variations at the same period and phase as the radio binary .",

    "the msp 47  tuc  h ( w74 ) is found in a relatively blank region of 47  tuc and we are able to set upper limits in @xmath2 and @xmath0 of 25.8 and 23.7 respectively . no stars with non - ms colors or variability were found within the error circle of the msp 47  tuc  o ( w39 ) .    to look for binary msp counterparts in the cases where no x - ray source was detected with wavdetect ( 47  tuc q and t ) , we used the astrometry techniques given in   [ sect.ast ] ( and used in grindlay et al .",
    "2002 ) to shift the radio coordinate frame onto the x - ray coordinate frame using the 6 relatively isolated msps detected with _ chandra_. the resulting positional errors for the 16 msps after making these linear fits were dominated by the relatively large errors ( 01 - 015 ) in the x - ray positions ( the radio errors are a few milliarcseconds ) .",
    "then the corrected x - ray positions were transformed to the _ hst _  coordinate frame , on a chip - by - chip basis , using the large number of optical counterparts to x - ray sources , with the smaller errors for this transformation ( compared to the radio to x - ray transformation ) propagated into the final msp errors .    using this astrometry , one likely , very faint ( @xmath61",

    "a possible blue star also exists within 0.09@xmath26 ( 0.82@xmath27 ) of 47  tuc  i ( w19 ) , however in this case the possible @xmath2-bright star is much more crowded than the candidate near 47  tuc  t , and is only a marginal candidate at best .",
    "the psf is not unambiguously stellar and could , e.g. be the combination of light from several unresolved stars .",
    "the derived @xmath2 magnitude is @xmath1924 and the extreme crowding is likely to limit useful follow - up observations at optical wavelengths , but uv observations with acs / hrc may provide useful constraints .",
    "the detection of an optical counterpart to 47  tuc  i would be of great interest , since this msp has a very low mass companion ( no optical companions for such objects have been detected in globular clusters ) .    for 47  tuc  q",

    "[ fig.gill-pc1wf2 ] ) .",
    "this shows no evidence for a power spectrum signal at the 1.189 day binary period detected in the radio , but it does show evidence for a signal in the @xmath0-band with period@xmath66 days and amplitude = @xmath67 ( 8.5@xmath27 ) .",
    "this period is @xmath68 away from being one third of the period of 47  tuc  q. no interesting signal is seen in @xmath1 . since the binary orbit of 47  tuc  q is very close to circular ( freire et al .",

    "the possible cv i d for w35 was discussed in   [ sect.cvphot ] .",
    "the source w16 ( 102 cts ) falls in a very crowded part of the _ hst _  image ( it lies 0.6@xmath26 from a bright , variable red giant ) .",
    "its nearest counterparts in the @xmath2 images are at 1.2 , 3.8 and 3.9 @xmath27 with @xmath2 mags of 21.4 , 18.3 and 20.5 respectively , but the effects of the giant star severely limit results in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . because of the hard x - ray spectrum and its reasonably high luminosity this source is most likely a cv .",
    "finally , w17 is discussed in paper  ii as a possible cv or qlmxb .",
    "the sources w20 , w24 , w32 and w37 all have bright , but apparently non - variable stars within 3@xmath27 of the x - ray positions ( w20 has a @xmath0=17.6 star at 0.44@xmath27 ; w24 a @xmath0=16.0 star at 1.35@xmath27 ; w32 a @xmath0=17.5 star at 1.48@xmath27 ; w37 was discussed in   [ sect.abs ] ) .",
    "presumably these bright stars could be active binaries with low inclinations giving a small observed amplitude for orbital variations ( and the star near w24 is saturated , so the time series have lower quality than available for msto stars ) , or they could be overpowering the light of fainter optical ids , such as cvs . also , the bright star near w24 is found on the blue side of the giant branch ( based on preliminary photometry of short exposures ) , suggesting binarity .",
    "although none of these objects are suggested as cv candidates by knigge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , their cmd uses a color based on far - uv and f336w magnitudes , and the light contamination from the nearby ms stars and subgiants may prevent the detection of fainter objects in f336w that represent the true counterparts . however , msto stars and subgiants are much fainter in the far - uv and therefore , close examination of the images of knigge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and spectroscopic and variability studies of nearby uv stars should be useful in searching for cv counterparts in the uv .",
    "these 4 _ chandra _  sources may also have msp counterparts , but they are all brighter than the most luminous msp and the faintest ( w37 ) is a variable x - ray source .",
    "several of the fainter ( @xmath71 ct ) , unidentified sources , have saturated stars nearby that may have prevented the detection of faint objects like cvs .",
    "the source w10 has a saturated star ( @xmath0=15.3 ) within 027 ( 2.4@xmath27 ) , w31 has a saturated star ( @xmath0=15.9 ) within 023 ( 2.1@xmath27 ) , w98 has 3 saturated stars ( @xmath0=15.1 - 16.0 ) within 04 ( 2.0@xmath27 ) , w115 has a saturated star ( @xmath0=17.0 ) within 03 ( 2.1@xmath27 ) , w141 has a saturated star ( @xmath0=14.0 ) within 022 ( 1.5@xmath27 ) , and w168 has a saturated star ( @xmath0=13.6 ) within 016 ( 0.7@xmath27 ) .",
    "several of these examples ( especially w168 and w141 ) may represent the detection of the saturated star itself , most likely as an rs cvn .",
    "we have discovered ( or confirmed ) optical counterparts for 22 _ chandra _  sources that are likely cvs as summarized in tables  [ tab.8267 ] and [ tab.7503 ] ( we have included v3 in this list , but it may be a qlmxb , as discussed in paper  ii ) .",
    "edmonds et al . ( 2002b ) tentatively classified w34@xmath35  as an msp companion based on the similarity of its @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves with the 47  tuc  w companion , but it may also be a cv . alternatively , a small number of msps may be included in our cv sample , as discussed in paper  ii . among the marginal candidates given in tables  [ tab.8267 ] and [ tab.7503 ] we believe that w140@xmath35  and w55@xmath35  ( see fig .  [ fig.marg-fchart ] ) have the greatest chances of being cvs , although the chance of astrometric coincidences is now significant ( 4.1% and 10.8% ) .",
    "this is easily the largest sample of cvs detected in a single globular cluster .",
    "the photometric properties of these stars are summarized as : ( 1 ) they all have @xmath3 or f300w - f555w colors that place them well bluewards of the ms , with the exception of ako  9 ( with its bright secondary ) ; ( 2 ) the optical ids for w2 , w8 , w25 , v2 , v3 , w44 and w120 all lie on or close to the ms in @xmath0 vs @xmath4 ( similar behavior is seen in the cvs discovered in ngc  6397 and ngc  6752 ) , while only v1 , w1@xmath35  and w21@xmath35  and possibly w34@xmath35  are found well to the blue of the ms .",
    "these results show that the secondaries generally dominate the optical light and that the accretion disks are relatively faint , suggesting that these systems have low accretion rates .",
    "strong support for this hypothesis is given in paper  ii , where the periods for some of these objects , and their absolute magnitude , x - ray luminosity and @xmath72  distributions will be presented .",
    "unfortunately , because of crowding in the _ hst _",
    "images , our sample of cvs does not reach the very faint absolute magnitudes ( @xmath73@xmath4410 ) discussed by townsley & bildsten ( 2002 ) in their modeling of low accretion rate cvs with periods below the period gap . for making direct comparison with the @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 magnitudes predicted by townsley & bildsten ( 2002 ) , matters are even worse because : ( 1 ) some of the faintest cvs in the go-8267 fov lack @xmath1 magnitudes ( e.g. w15@xmath35  & w70@xmath35 ) , and ( 2 ) the cvs found only in the go-7503 fov all lack @xmath1 magnitudes ( and , in many cases , f555w magnitudes ) .",
    "a couple of the faintest cv candidates ( w34@xmath35  & w140@xmath35 ) do have bluer colors than the ms , suggesting a greater contribution from the wd , as predicted by townsley & bildsten ( 2002 ) at faint magnitudes .",
    "however , w34@xmath35  could be an msp , and w140@xmath35  is only a marginal cv candidate , and even if they are cvs , their bluer colors could be explained by either relatively bright accretion disks or lower inclinations than average .",
    "we do not find convincing evidence for x - ray emission from the blue variables discussed by agb01 , although one of these objects ( 1v36 ) may be a weak , crowded x - ray source ; see also the discussions of the uv and optical properties of 1v36 in ferraro et al .",
    "( 2001a ) and knigge et al .",
    "possible explanations for these blue variables will be discussed in paper  ii .",
    "adding up the total number of active binary candidates in tables  [ tab.8267 ] and [ tab.7503 ] ( counting only w43 and w64 of the go-7503 data candidates ) we have observed a total of 29 likely active binaries . except for w43@xmath35  and w64@xmath35 ,",
    "all of these are found in the go-8267 fov and show statistically significant , mostly periodic , variability ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "they are mostly found on , or slightly above , the ms or subgiant ridge - line except for w69@xmath35  and a handful of red stragglers or red straggler candidates .",
    "several marginal active binaries have also been found . the total sample of active binaries in 47  tuc above our x - ray detection threshold will inevitably be larger , and in particular a number of ms - ms binaries that were outside the go-8267 fov should be found in the go-7503 fov .",

    "<S> we report , in this study of 47  tucanae , the largest number of optical identifications of x - ray sources yet obtained in a single globular cluster . using deep _ chandra_/acis - i imaging and extensive _ hst </S>",
    "<S> _  studies with wfpc2 ( including a 120 orbit program giving superb @xmath0 and @xmath1 images ) , we have detected optical counterparts to at least 22 cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and 29 chromospherically active binaries ( by draconis and rs canum venaticorum systems ) in 47  tuc . </S>",
    "<S> these identifications are all based on tight astrometric matches between x - ray sources and objects with unusual ( non main sequence ) optical colors and/or optical variability . </S>",
    "<S> several other cvs and active binaries have likely been found , but these have marginal significance because of larger offsets between the x - ray and optical positions , or colors and variability that are not statistically convincing . </S>",
    "<S> these less secure optical identifications are not subsequently discussed in detail .    in the @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> vs @xmath3 color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , where the @xmath2-band corresponds to either f336w or f300w , the cvs all show evidence for blue colors compared to the main sequence , but most of them fall close to the main sequence in the @xmath0 vs @xmath4 cmd , showing that the secondary stars dominate the optical light . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray detected active binaries have magnitude offsets above the main sequence ( in both the @xmath2 vs @xmath3 or @xmath0 vs @xmath4 cmds ) that are indistinguishable from those of the much larger sample of optical variables ( eclipsing and contact binaries and by dra variables ) detected in the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) studies of albrow et al . </S>",

    "<S> we also present the results of a new , deeper search for optical companions to msps . </S>",
    "<S> one possible optical companion to an msp ( 47  tuc  t ) was found , adding to the two optical companions already known . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study several blue stars with periodic variability from albrow et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) that show little or no evidence for x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> the optical colors of these objects differ from those of 47  tuc ( and field ) cvs .    </S>",
    "<S> an accompanying paper will present time series results for these optical identifications , and will discuss x - ray to optical flux ratios , spatial distributions and an overall interpretation of the results . </S>"
