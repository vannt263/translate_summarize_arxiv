    "relativistic analyses based on the dirac equation have shown that they can achieve better agreement with experimental intermediate energy proton scattering data than the nonrelativistic analyses based on the schrdinger equation@xcite . because the dirac analyses have proven to be very successful for the intermediate energy proton elastic scatterings from the spherically symmetric nuclei and a few deformed nuclei@xcite ,",
    "the relativistic approaches have been expanded to the inelastic scatterings and have shown considerable improvements compared to the conventional nonrelativistic analyses@xcite .",
    "one of the merits of the dirac approach instead of using the nonrelativistic approach is that the spin - orbit potential appears naturally in the dirac approach when the dirac equation is reduced to a schrdinger - like second - order differential equation , while the spin - orbit potential should be inserted by hand in the nonrelativistic schrdinger approach .    in this work we performed a relativistic dirac analysis for the inelastic proton scatterings from an s - d shell nucleus @xmath0ne by using the optical potential model@xcite and the first - order collective model .",

    "dirac analyses are performed phenomenologically for the 800 mev unpolarized proton inelastic scatterings from @xmath0ne by using optical potential model and the collective model .",
    "because @xmath0ne is one of the spin-0 nuclei , only scalar , time - like vector and tensor optical potentials survive@xcite , as in spherically symmetric nuclei@xcite ; hence , the relevant dirac equation for the elastic scattering from the nucleus is given as @xmath4 \\psi(r ) = 0 .",

    "we assume that the shape of the deformed potentials follows the shape of the deformed nuclear densities and that the transition potentials can be obtained by assuming that they are proportional to the first - order derivatives of the diagonal potentials .",
    "however , depending on the model assumed , pseudo - scalar and axial - vector potentials may also be present in the equation when we consider inelastic scattering . in the collective model approach used in this work",
    ", we assume that we can obtain appropriate transition potentials by deforming the direct potentials that describe the elastic channel reasonably well@xcite . in order to compare the calculated results with those of the previous nonrelativistic calculations , we reduce the dirac equation to a schrdinger - like second - order differential equation by considering the upper component of the dirac wave function to obtain the effective central and spin - orbit optical potentials@xcite .",
