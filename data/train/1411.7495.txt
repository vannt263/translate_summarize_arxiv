    "quantum correlation has recently attracted much interest as resource of quantum tasks including quantum parameter estimation @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "there exist many kinds of quantum correlations .",
    "one of the most known is quantum entanglement .",
    "remote state transfer using quantum teleportation requires nonzero amount of entanglement as resource .",
    "however it is often stressed that entanglement is not the only quantum correlation .",
    "the concept of quantum discord , which has been introduced on reference @xcite and @xcite , can be nonzero even if entanglement exactly vanishes .",
    "discord without entanglement is referred as quantum dissonance . in general , it is important to identify the correlation as information resource for every quantum protocol .",
    "quantum energy teleportation ( qet ) @xcite is a quantum protocol , which attains energy transfer in an operational meaning . for quantum many - body systems ,",
    "the interaction among subsystems generates quantum correlations in the ground states .",
    "since energy density operators of the system do not commute with each other due to this interaction , uncertainty relations yield zero - point fluctuation of energy density in the ground states . with a shift of the energy such as the average energy density of the system",
    "is fixed as zero , the energy density fluctuates between the zero value .",
    "thus we have negative energy density in quantum theory .",
    "this zero - point energy density fluctuations of two separate subsystems a and b are quantum mechanically correlated .",
    "hence , if we measure subsystem a and obtain the measurement result @xmath0 , this includes some information about energy density around subsystem b. during this measurement , positive amount of energy @xmath1 is injected into a , because the post - measurement state is not the ground state but an excited state .",
    "this property is called the passivity of the ground state . by performing an appropriate local operation on b , dependent on @xmath0 , the quantum fluctuation can be suppressed and negative energy density appears around b. because of energy conservation , positive amount of energy @xmath2 is extracted by the operation device on b. note that b is in a state with zero - energy before the measurement , thus extraction of @xmath2 looks like energy extraction from nothing .",
    "this is qet .",
    "@xmath1 is regarded as input energy and @xmath2 as output energy of qet .",
    "non - negativity of total hamiltonian imposes @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the qet protocol has attracted attention for future development of nano - scale smart grids with low power consumption @xcite .",
    "an experiment to verify qet using edge channel currents in a quantum hall system has been proposed @xcite .",
    "qet is also related with information thermodynamics .",
    "quantum maxwell s demons , by using the measurement results , are able to adopt qet in order to extract more energy out of quantum systems @xcite . in black hole physics ,",
    "qet plays a crucial role . by measuring zero - point fluctuation of quantum fields outside horizon and performing qet , the area of event horizon shrinks and its black hole entropy decreases @xcite .",
    "even in low temperature cases , qet remains effective . in gibbs states below a critical temperature , many - body systems which have ground states with maximum - rank entanglement structure ,",
    "satisfy strong local passivity @xcite .",
    "this means that positive amount of energy is injected during arbitrary local operations .",
    "therefore , we are not able to extract thermal energy from subsystem b only by local operations . in the low - temperature regime ,",
    "thermal energy extraction requires global operations like time evolution generated by hamiltonian .",
    "however , if we adopt a qet protocol , the passivity is broken and a part of thermal energy can be extracted @xcite .",
    "as conventional quantum teleportation , it is of importance to understand what correlation is the resource of qet . for the case of the ground state , it is known that quantum entanglement is the resource of qet @xcite . however , the finite - temperature case is nontrivial . in a simple toy model with a two qubit chain with non - demolition measurements of the interaction hamiltonian , quantum discord",
    "is seen to act as a resource for qet at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , so far other quantum systems have not been explored .",
    "in addition , the two - spin model imposes a severe limitation on qet optimization problem of local measurements of energy - sender qubit .",
    "only non - demolition measurements are available , which do not disturb the potential term between the two spins .",
    "thus there exists no consensus about the resource in general cases beyond the two qubit system .    to avoid the limitation of available measurements , we consider a three - spin open chain model and qet from one edge spin to another edge spin in this paper .",
    "the optimal measurements of energy - sender spin and optimal local unitary operations of energy - receiver spin , which provide the maximal amount of teleported energy , are determined in the ground - state case and finite - temperature case .",
    "the maximum teleported energy is compared to various two - body correlations between two edge spins , including quantum mutual information , quantum discord @xcite , concurrence @xcite , and negativity @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the two qubit chain , we show that quantum discord is not a perfect resource of qet in the three qubit system . through the variations of one of the parameters in the model",
    ", we found that the optimal teleported energy becomes zero in some cases at zero and finite temperature , where entanglement vanishes , but quantum discord is still present .",
    "this implies that quantum discord can not become qet resource of this system at this regime .",
    "in other words , we found a regime where there is quantum discord between the edge spins but energy teleportation is not possible .",
    "this is an unexpected result and crucial for the identification problem of quantum task resource .",
    "because through the variation of one parameter in the model it is possible to modify the amount of teleported energy , such as it is impossible to have qet ; we pose an analogy between energy transportation in the three spin chain model and field effect transistors ( fet ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section ii introduces our three - particle model and also outlines the derivation of the teleported energy when using projective measurements ; the supporting calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "section iii explores the relationship between the qet protocol s efficiency and the degree and type of quantum correlations in the system .",
    "section iv contains a detailed study , using the most general measurements that can be applied to the system , of the regime in which no teleported energy is possible , even though there are quantum correlations .",
    "section v offers our conclusions .",
    "consider a system of three spin @xmath4 particles , whose labels are 1 , 2 and 3 respectively , with hamiltonian : @xmath5    the model resembles the ising chain model in a transverse magnetic field for only three elements in the chain , without the interaction term corresponding to the periodic boundary conditions associated to a ring topology .",
    "the @xmath6 operators are the pauli operators , @xmath7 is a dimensionless parameter that takes real values and represents the relative strength of the coupling between spins and the intensity of the magnetic field , and @xmath8 , also a dimensionless parameter , represents the strength of the coupling of the spin of particle 2 with the transverse magnetic field .",
    "the presence of these two parameters in the model allow us to study the two main factors in order to teleport energy ; the amount of correlations between subcomponents of the total system , and the capability to generate local negative energy density around subsystem b after bob s operation .",
    "if we restrict bob to perform measurements on particle 3 , then it s local hamiltonian is independent of @xmath8 @xmath9    therefore , though the parameter @xmath8 is unrelated to the generation of local negative energy at particle 3 , it is related to the correlation between particles 1 and 3 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath10 the total hamiltonian reduces to the @xmath11 component of particle 2 , meaning , in particular , that particles 1 and 3 become uncorrelated .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 also dictates the degeneracy of the system ; when @xmath12 the system is completely degenerated ( because in this case the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) commutes with @xmath13 ) and non - degenerate otherwise . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath7 parameter is related to the generation of local negative energy , since it is present on bob local hamiltonian ( [ boblocal ] ) and to the correlations since physically represents the coupling between spins , in other words , in the limit @xmath14 there are not correlations .",
    "specifically , fixing a value of @xmath7 while changing the parameter @xmath8 is equivalent to study the effect of only the correlations of the system in the energy teleportation .    since the hamiltonian is dimensionless ,",
    "so are the eigenergies [ appendix [ appendix ] ] .",
    "if the three - particle system described by equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is weakly coupled to a thermal bath with temperature _ t _ , the state of the system will be given by a gibbs state [ appendix [ appendix ] ] .",
    "since the eigenergies are dimensionless , so it is the temperature parameter _",
