    "radio - optical variability correlation in qso 0957 + 561 ( first gravitationally lensed system ) , was first reported by oknyanskij and beskin ( 1993 ) , on the basis of vla ( 6 cm ) radio observations made in the years 1979 to 1990 .",
    "then we have found that the time delay value was a linear function of time with the rate of increase being about 110 days / year while the portion of reradiate flux in the radioresponse was some decreasing function of time ( oknyanskij , 1997,1998 ) .",
    "our results allowed predictions to be made for radio variations for the years 1995 and latter .",
    "at the present time , new vla radio observations ( at 4 cm and 6 cm ) of qso 0957 + 561 during 1995 - 1997 have been published ( haarsma et al .",
    "1999 ) by which we may check the predictions .",
    "we have found that 6 cm variations followed 4 cm ones with delay about 230 days ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we take this fact into account as well as gravitational lensing time delay between variations in a and b to have got combined radio light curve .",
    "as we have found the radio light curve during these 3 years have been following our predictions in limits of the estimated standard errors ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "obtained results indicate that the optical and radio emitting regions are physically related , but have distinct size scales , locations and possibly radiation mechanisms .",
    "we conclude that the variable radio source is ejected from the central part of the qso compact component ( oknyanskij , 1999 ) .",
    "obtained results imply existence of the variable beamed hard radiation in the nucleus of the qso .",
