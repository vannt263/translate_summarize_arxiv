    "it has been the consensus that future 5 g networks should achieve the 1000-fold increase in system capacity  @xcite .",
    "to realize such an aggressive 5 g version , millimeter - wave ( mmwave ) massive mimo used for the access and backhaul in ultra - dense network ( udn ) has been considered as a promising technique to enable gigabit - per - second user experience , seamless coverage , and green communication  @xcite . in this paper , we consider the heterogeneous network ( hetnet ) with the separation of control plane and data plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hetnet ] .",
    "for such an hetnet , the macrocell base station ( bs ) provides the control signaling service for the large coverage area using conventional low frequency band , while the ultra - dense small bss are specialized in data resources with limited coverage area for high - rate transmission , where the emerging mmwave massive mimo technique is exploited for the access and backhaul  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the centralized radio access network ( c - ran ) architecture can be integrated into the hetnet for the improved physical layer transmission , handover , scheduling , and etc . , where the ultra - dense small cells are regarded as the remote ratio head ( rrh ) and macrocell bs is considered as the baseband unit ( bbu ) .        due to the ultra - dense deployment , each user may receive the signal from multiple rrhs . to exploit the advantages of c - ran architecture ,",
    "the accurate channel state information ( csi ) associated with multiple rrhs known at bbu is essential for the joint beamforming , scheduling , and cooperation among the ultra - dense small - cell bss .",
    "however , how to require the reliable channel estimation with low overhead can be challenging , since the pilot overhead to estimate the channels associated with a large number of antennas in mmwave massive mimo can be prohibitively high @xcite .",
    "@xcite have proposed a multilevel codebook based joint channel estimation and beamforming for mmwave access and backhaul .",
    "however , this scheme only considers the mmwave multi - antenna systems with analog beamforming , which is limited to the point - to - point based single - stream transmission . to solve this problem ,",
    "the mmwave massive mimo has been emerging @xcite , where the hybrid analog - digital beamforming scheme is proposed to support the multi - stream transmission with low hardware cost and energy consumption . in @xcite ,",
    "an adaptive channel estimation has been proposed for mmwave massive mimo .",
    "however , this scheme is limited to the single - cell scenario . besides",
    ", @xcite has proposed the reference signal design for the channel estimation in mmwave massive mimo",
    ". however , the scheme fails to exploit the sparsity of mmwave channels , which may lead to a certain performance loss .",
    "recent study and experiments have shown that the mmwave massive mimo channels appear the obviously sparsity in the angular domain  @xcite , since the path loss for non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) paths is much larger than that for line - of - sight ( los ) paths in mmwave @xcite . moreover , since the spatial propagation characteristics of the mmwave channels within the system bandwidth are nearly unchanged , such sparsity is shared by subchannels of different subcarriers when the widely used orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is considered .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as the _ spatially common sparsity within the system bandwidth _ @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we first propose the non - orthogonal pilot design at the small - cell bss used for channel estimation .",
    "furthermore , we propose a structured compressive sensing ( scs)-based sparse channel estimation scheme at the receiver to estimate the channels for the mmwave massive mimo in udn .",

    "conventionally , mmwave is considered to be not suitable for access due to its high path loss , moreover , the signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) before beamforming is conventionally considered to be low due to the high path loss , which leads to the challenging channel estimation in mmwave communications . however , for the udn scenarios , we will clarify this misunderstanding by comparing the path loss in udn working at 30 ghz and that in conventional cellular networks working at 3 ghz . specifically , considering the multipath fading , signal dispersion , and other loss factors , the path loss component of friis equation in decibel ( db ) can be provided as @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( mhz ) is the carrier frequency , @xmath27 ( db / km ) is the path loss exponent , @xmath28 ( km ) is the link distance , @xmath29 ( db / km ) is the atmospheric attenuation coefficient , and @xmath30 ( db / km ) is the rain attenuation coefficient . for the conventional cellular systems with @xmath31 ghz and @xmath32 km for example , we have @xmath33 db , where @xmath34 db / km is considered in urban scenarios @xcite , and the atmospheric attenuation and rain attenuation are ignored .",
    "by contrast , for udn with @xmath35 ghz , we have @xmath36 db with @xmath37 m for backhaul link and @xmath38 db with @xmath39 m for access link , where @xmath34 db / km , @xmath40 db / km , and @xmath41 db / km when the heavy rain with 25 mm / h is considered @xcite . due to the short link distance , the path loss in mmwave is even smaller than that in conventional cellular networks , which indicates the appropriate snr for channel estimation in the mmwave access and backhaul even before beamforming .",
    "on the other hand , mmwave massive mimo has been emerging as the promising technique for access and backhaul @xcite . for the mmwave massive mimo , as shown in fig .",

    "we consider frequency - domain subchannel @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) at the @xmath58th subcarrier , where @xmath59 is the size of the ofdm symbol , and the relationship between the frequency - domain channel @xmath56 and the delay - domain channel @xmath60 has been illustrated in our recent paper @xcite .",
    "moreover , we can obtain the sparse channel matrix in the angular domain @xmath61 as @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the discrete fourier transformation ( dft ) matrices by quantizing the virtual angular domain with the resolutions of @xmath65 at the transmitter and @xmath66 at the receiver , respectively . by vectorizing @xmath56",
