    "restriction of the functional integral to the first gribov region @xmath0 given as the set of transverse gauge configurations for which the faddeev - popov ( fp ) matrix @xmath3 is non - negative defines the so - called minimal landau gauge in yang - mills theories @xcite",
    ". on the lattice , this gauge fixing is implemented by a minimization procedure ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , without the need to consider the addition of a nonlocal horizon - function term @xmath4 to the ( landau - gauge ) action , as done in the gribov - zwanziger ( gz ) approach in the continuum @xcite .",
    "let us recall that , in the gz approach , the resulting ( nonlocal ) action may be localized by introducing auxiliary fields .",
    "also , one can define for these fields a nilpotent brst transformation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which is a simple extension of the usual perturbative brst transformation that leaves the yang - mills action invariant in linear covariant gauge .",
    "however , it can be easily verified that , in the gz case , this local brst symmetry is broken by terms proportional to the gribov parameter @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , since a nonzero value of @xmath5 is related to the restriction of the functional integration to @xmath0 , it is somewhat natural to expect a breaking of the perturbative brst symmetry , as a direct consequence of the nonperturbative gauge - fixing .",
    "this issue has been investigated in several works ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the above interpretation is supported by the recent introduction of a nilpotent nonperturbative brst transformation @xcite , which leaves the local gz action invariant . and redefine the nakanishi - lautrup field @xmath6 by a shift . see refs .",

    "the new symmetry is a simple modification of the usual brst transformation @xmath7 , by adding ( for some of the fields ) a nonlocal term proportional to the gribov parameter @xmath5 , thus recovering the usual perturbative transformation @xmath7 when @xmath5 is set to zero .",
    "as indicated above , the gribov parameter @xmath5 is _ not _ introduced explicitly on the lattice , since in this case the restriction of gauge - configuration space to the region @xmath0 is achieved directly by numerical minimization .",
    "nevertheless , the breaking of the perturbative brst symmetry induced by the gz action may be investigated by the lattice computation of suitable observables , such as the so - called bose - ghost propagator , which has been proposed as a carrier of the long - range confining force in minimal landau gauge @xcite .",
    "the first numerical evaluation of the bose - ghost propagator in minimal landau gauge was presented for the su(2 ) case in four space - time dimensions in refs .",
    "@xcite . the data for this propagator show a strong infrared ( ir ) enhancement , with a double - pole singularity at small momenta , in agreement with the one - loop analysis carried out in ref .",
    "the data are also well described by a simple fitting function , which can be related to a massive gluon propagator in combination with an ir - free fp ghost propagator .",
    "those results constitute the first numerical manifestation of brst - symmetry breaking in the gz approach .    here",
    "we extend our previous calculations and present the details of the numerical evaluation of the bose - ghost propagator .",
    "in particular , we consider three different lattice definitions of this propagator in order to check that the results obtained are in agreement with each other .",
    "we also present our final data for the propagator complementing the results already reported in @xcite and we analyze the infinite - volume and continuum limits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , following refs.@xcite , we set up the notation and introduce the continuum definitions necessary for the evaluation of the bose - ghost propagator .",
    "then , in section [ sec : latt ] , we address the corresponding definitions on the lattice and describe the algorithms used in our monte carlo simulations . finally , in the last two sections , we present the output of these simulations and our concluding remarks .",
