    "circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) created by stellar winds from stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stage are active sites of molecular synthesis . thus far ,",
    "more than 70 molecular species have been detected in cses ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "during the post - agb evolution , the effective temperatures of the central stars steeply increase , while at the same time , the remnants of the cse expand and disperse . the increasing ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation fields gradually dissociate the molecules , and finally ionize the envelopes , leading to the formation of planetary nebulae ( pns ) .",
    "the proto - planetary nebula ( ppn ) is a rapid ( @xmath3 yr ) transition phase between the agb and pn phases @xcite .",
    "the chemical processes during the evolution from the agb to pn phases , however , are far from fully understood .",
    "different carbon - to - oxygen abundance ratio sets up different reaction routes .",
    "although the molecular species in carbon - rich environments is generally thought to be more abundant than that in oxygen - rich environments , @xcite recently found unexpected complexity of the chemistry in oxygen - rich environments .",

    "our research group has undertaken a long - term project devoted to systematic molecular line surveys of a sample of evolved stars over a wide frequency range .",
    "we have reported the observations of carbon - rich agb stars irc+10216 , cit6 , afgl3068 , and a young pn ngc7027 in 1.3 mm , 2 mm , 3 mm , and 7 mm bands @xcite . since the same instrumental settings were used , the systematic uncertainties in the study of circumstellar chemistry are minimized .",
    "our results demonstrate that the evolved stars in the agb stage have similar chemical compositions and the differences in the abundance of long carbon - chain and si - bearing molecules can be explained by slightly different evolutionary status and carbon abundances . in the pn stage ,",
    "the chemical composition changes dramatically with the enhancement of ionized species and the destruction of long - chain molecules , implying the considerable influence of uv radiation field and/or shock waves on the circumstellar chemistry .",
    "the present paper is the sixth part of this series .",
    "we present a 3 mm and 1.3 mm spectral line survey toward the carbon - rich ppn afgl2688 , with the goal of investigating the chemical transition in the short evolutionary timescale between the agb and pn stages .",
    "afgl2688 ( crl 2688 , v1610 cyg , the egg nebula ) is a bipolar ppn whose visible appearance consists of a pair of bipolar lobes , a dark equatorial lane , and a large number of roughly concentric arcs @xcite . the dark equatorial lane exhibits strong emission from h@xmath1 and co @xcite , suggesting the presence of molecular matter .",
    "details of the stellar wind history and the nebular structures have been thoroughly discussed by @xcite , who obtained an expansion velocity of 1518kms@xmath4 .",
    "the dynamical age of the nebula and mass loss rate were estimated to be @xmath5350 yr and @xmath6m@xmath7yr@xmath4 , respectively @xcite . the central star of afgl2688 is a completely obscured f - type supergiant with an effective temperature of about 7250k and enhanced abundances of carbon , nitrogen , neon , and yttrium @xcite .",

    "@xcite estimated a distance of 11.5kpc , while a smaller value ( 0.30.42kpc ) was obtained by @xcite and @xcite based on the expansion velocity . in lack of an accurate determination , we have adopted the commonly used value of 1kpc @xcite .    because of their brightness in the infrared and strong molecular emissions , afgl618 and afgl2688 are two of the most well studied ppns , and are therefore suitable for spectral line surveys at millimeter wavelengths . in terms of morphology ,",
    "both objects are bipolar nebulae and @xcite suggested that the molecular richness observed in the two ppns is due to the presence of dense and optically thick equatorial tori separating the bipolar lobes . based on the spectral type ( b0 ) of the central star , afgl618 is more evolved than afgl2688 and is closer to becoming a pn .",
    "the line survey of afgl618 has been performed by @xcite with the iram 30 m telescope in the frequency range of 80276ghz . for afgl2688 ,",

    "the deduced column densities are in order - of - magnitude agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that finite opitical depth @xmath110 can cause deviations of the points from a straight line on the rotation diagram , and an optical correction factor @xmath111 should be introduced in the rotation diagram .",
    "however , using the `` population diagram '' technique presented by @xcite , we found that the @xmath112 values for all the species in figure  [ dia ] are too small ( @xmath113 ) to affect our results .",

    "although not strictly true , the derived @xmath115o/@xmath33o abundance ratio is expected to be positively correlated with that of @xmath73c/@xmath26c since both @xmath26c and @xmath33o are produced by @xmath73c and @xmath115o through ( @xmath120 ) reactions followed by @xmath121 decay .",

    "@xcite , we can clearly see a positive correlation between @xmath115o/@xmath33o and @xmath73c/@xmath26c ratios ( figure  [ isoto ] ) .    on the other hand , @xmath26c and @xmath33o",

    "the enhancement of @xmath116n in carbon - rich cses has been confirmed by the observations of @xcite , who obtained a lower limit of 544 for the @xmath116n/@xmath72n ratio in afgl2688 , about twice higher than the solar value .",

    "the lower @xmath116n/@xmath72n value in afgl2688 may be related to the slightly lower @xmath73c/@xmath26c and @xmath115o/@xmath33o ratios than those in irc+10216 ( figure  [ isoto ] ) , suggesting that the two objects probably have different intrinsic properties , such as metallicity and mass .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of sulfur isotopes @xmath38s and @xmath39s requires relatively high temperatures , which are are unlikely to be achieved in the interior of intermediate- and low- mass stars .",
    "this is supported by our results that no discrepancy between the s isotopic ratios in afgl2688 and the solar values is found .",
    "in order to investigate the chemical evolution of circumstellar envelopes during the agb  ppn  pn transitions , we have plotted the integrated - intensity ratios of the molecular lines in afgl2688 , irc+10216 and ngc7027 in figures  [ withirc ] and [ withngc ] , respectively . the @xmath125(afgl2688)/@xmath125(irc+10216 ) and @xmath125(ngc7027)/@xmath125(afgl2688 ) ratios of the lines from the molecular species x [ respectively represented as @xmath126(x ) and @xmath127(x ) hereafter ] can , to some extent , reflect the relative abundance of x in these objects .",
    "although line intensity ratios can be affected by factors in addition to molecular abundance , such as different excitation conditions and optical depths , these effects can be substantially reduced by comparing lines arising from different levels .",
    "therefore , our observations covering a wide frequency range are particularly suited for such a study .",
    "our results show that @xmath126(x ) ranges from 0.02 to 2.89 with a mean value of 0.41 , while @xmath127(x ) ranges from 0.02 to 20.2 with a mean value of 1.64 . generally , the chemical pattern of afgl2688 is more similar to that of irc+10216 compared to ngc7027 , suggesting that the radiation field from the central star plays an important role on circumstellar chemistry and can alter chemical composition over a short time scale .",
    "irc+10216 is the closest carbon - rich star ( @xmath128120pc , * ? ? ?",
    "ngc7027 has a similar distance ( @xmath5880pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as afgl2688 .",
    "if the three objects had nearly identical intrinsic brightness , the line intensities should be proportional to @xmath129 , as denoted by the dashed lines in figures  [ withirc ] and [ withngc ] .",
    "we can infer from figures  [ withirc ] and [ withngc ] that the intrinsic molecular line strengths in afgl2688 and ngc7027 are consistently at least one order of magnitude higher than those in irc+10216 if they are at the same distance from the earth .",
    "this suggests that the detection of abundant molecular species in irc+10216 is not so much because of its unique chemical nature , but its proximity .",
    "furthermore , the degree of chemical activity has increased , not decreased , since the end of agb .    nevertheless , there are some differences in the molecular abundance of irc+10216 and afgl2688 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ withirc ] , the abundance of cn - bearing molecules , such as hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cn , is enhanced in afgl2688 .",
    "cn - bearing molecules have a chemical link with nh@xmath0 , a molecule formed near the central star .",
    "@xcite found that the nh@xmath0 lines in afgl2688 are stronger than those in irc+10216 by a factor of @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , it can be inferred that the injection of nh@xmath0 during the agb - to - ppn evolution enhances the production of cn - bearing molecules in afgl2688 through subsequent reactions .",
    "figure  [ withirc ] also indicates that si - bearing molecules ( sis , sio , and sic@xmath1 ) appear to be depleted in afgl2688 with respect to irc+10216 , suggesting that the refractory species have partly condensed into dust grains .",
    "sis appears to be more depleted than sio and sic@xmath1 .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that sis has been converted into other silicon species in the outer envelope through gas - phase photochemical reactions .",
    "detailed discussions about the chemistry of sis and sio in circumstellar envelopes have been given by other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also found that the h@xmath1co line in afgl2688 is much stronger than that in irc+10216 .",
    "h@xmath1co is known to be formed through the reaction between co and h on grain surface , and can be further transformed into methanol .",
    "the h@xmath1co line has a broader profile ( see figure  [ profile ] ) than the other molecular lines , probably implying it originates from an extended dust region .",
    "the detection of h@xmath1co , therefore , suggests that grain surface chemistry may be actively processing molecular gas in this ppn .",
    "based on their 3 mm observations , @xcite found that the c@xmath9h radical seems enhanced in afgl2688 with respect to irc+10216 .",
    "however , this is not supported by our 1.3 mm observations , which do not reveal c@xmath9h lines ( figure  [ withirc ] ) .",
    "the strengths of c@xmath9h lines suggest that this species is located at a very cool region so that the low - n transitions are strengthened whereas the high - n transitions are strongly suppressed .",
    "the central - star temperature of ngc7027 is about 30 times higher than that of afgl2688 .",
    "figure  [ withngc ] shows that most of neutral carbon chain molecules are destroyed during the evolution from ppn to pn , while hco@xmath2 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath131 .",
    "this is consistent with previous findings ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and can be attributed to the chemistry activated by uv photons from the central star .",
    "the @xmath73co/@xmath26co line ratios in ngc7027 are larger than those in afgl2688 , which can be attributed to decreasing optical depth as the result of nebular expansion .",
    "using the _ aro _ 12 m and _ smt _ 10 m telescopes , we have carried out a molecular - line survey of the ppn afgl2688 at the 3 mm and 1.3 mm windows .",
    "a total of 143 spectral lines corresponding to 32 molecular species and isotopologues were detected .",
    "only two faint lines remain unidentified .",
    "five molecules , namely c@xmath0h , ch@xmath0cn , h@xmath1co , h@xmath1cs , and hco@xmath2 , are new detections in this object .",
    "the sensitive spectra show no evidence for the presence of c@xmath1s in afgl2688 , contrary to the result of @xcite .",
    "we calculated the rotation temperature , the column densities and fractional abundances ( or their lower - limits ) of the identified molecules .    using the observed line ratios of several molecules , we are able to determine the isotopic abundance ratios of several elements .",
    "the @xmath73c/@xmath26c and @xmath115o/@xmath33o ratios are typical of circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars , and are considerably lower than the solar values .",
    "the @xmath116n/@xmath72n ratio in afgl2688 significantly differs from that in irc+10216 , probably reflecting different metallicities or / and masses of their progenitor stars .    by comparing the chemical compositions of afgl2688 with those of the agb star irc+10216 and the pn ngc7027 , we have come to the conclusion that afgl2688 and ngc7027 have thicker molecular envelopes than irc+10216 . while the chemical patterns of afgl2688 and irc+10216 are generally similar , we note that the chemistry in ngc 7027 is different , probably as the result of a drastically different radiation environment and photochemistry .",
    "nevertheless , we do note that there are slight differences between the molecular line strengths in and afgl2688 and irc+10216 , providing evidence for chemical evolution during the agb - to - ppn transition .",
    "specially , cn - containing molecules are enhanced and refractory molecules are depleted as the result of stellar evolution .",
    "while we are able to come to some useful conclusions on chemical evolution in the circumstellar environment , we do wish to note that the origin of chemical diversity in circumstellar envelopes can be complicted by a number of factors .",
    "the difference in molecular abundance can be the result of stellar evolution , metallicities , initial masses , mass - loss processes , dust properties , shock processes , morphological structures , interactions with the surrounding interstellar medium , just to name a few . in order to understand the roles of these various factors in circumstellar chemistry",
    ", it would be necessary to perform high - sensitivity spectral line survey of a large sample of evolved stars over wide frequency ranges .",
