    "do nt believe everything you read .",
    "even recently written textbooks on introductory nuclear physics can leave the reader with the impression that our understanding of low - energy nuclear structure is ill - defined .",
    "a typical example is found in dunlap,@xcite who opens with the time - independent schrdinger equation , then states that for atomic and solid physics  the difficulty ... lies , not in our lack of understanding of the fundamental properties of the electromagnetic interaction , but in the complexity of the mathematics ... however , in nuclear physics the [ potential ] has not been uniquely determined and a phenomenological approach is usually adopted . \"",
    "this statement is not really wrong , but it is not really correct either .",
    "while it is fair to say that the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential has not been uniquely determined , one can and should make a more careful statement : high - precision data does uniquely determine the _ on - shell _ behavior of the the nn interaction . as discussed during this symposium",
    ", it is the _ off - shell _ behavior , which is inextricably tied up with three - body on - shell interactions , that is not determined .",
    "this important distinction is often overlooked .    with the on - shell behavior of nn interactions",
    "firmly in hand , the last 10 + years have seen a variety@xcite of rigorous approaches to microscopic , _ ab initio _ calculations of the structure of light nuclei .",
    "one of these is based on the well - known interacting shell model , the `` no - core shell model '' of bruce barrett and collaborators .",
    "it is an irony of history that thirty years ago barrett and kirson s work@xcite ) ( on nonconvergence of particle - hole corrections to effective interactions was one of several bolides@xcite that caused a `` mass extinction '' of rigorous nuclear structure studies , by showing serious flaws in the then - current methodology .",
    "twenty years later , the no - core shell model was proposed@xcite precisely to avoid those flaws .",
    "we will not go deeply into the details@xcite of no - core calculations , but simply point out they are heavily computational , requiring bases with dimensions of millions , tens of millions , even hundreds of millions .",
    "for reductionist , _ ab initio _",
    "calculations this is the right thing to do . on the other hand ,",
    "it is useful to seek out approximations that , first , allow one to get preliminary results quickly and efficiently , and , second , illuminate the more detailed , precise results . toward this end",
    "we turn to the hartree - fock approximation , extended by the random - phase approximation .    in the next section we review some common understandings about rpa , while in section 3 we look at some common _ _ mis__understandings about rpa .",
    "while some material is a recitation of previous work , we present a new , nontrivial calculation illustrating the `` collapse '' of rpa , demonstrating the topic is more subtle than generally appreciated . finally , in section 4 we present and discuss preliminary results of applying deformed hf+rpa to the no - core shell model .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation is based on the variational principle ; the trial wavefunction is a slater determinant , an antisymmeterized product of single - particle wavefunctions .",
    "( for a good introduction we recommend the monograph of ring and schuck.@xcite ) the advantage of hartree - fock is that one can interpret the many - body wavefunction in terms of single - particle degrees of freedom .",
    "the disadvantage is that one loses correlations .",
    "the random phase approximation is a generalization of hartree - fock that includes small amplitude correlations.@xcite it can be derived by different approaches : time - dependent hartree - fock , equations - of - motion , and the quasi - boson harmonic approximation , which we favor .",
    "there are two equivalent formulation of rpa : green s function and matrix . for the latter one",
    "solves @xmath0 in simple terms , @xmath1 is the sub - matrix of the hamiltonian @xmath2 taken between one - particle , one - hole states , while @xmath3 is constructed from the matrix elements of @xmath2 between the hf state and two - particle , two - hole states .",
    "if one ignores @xmath3 , then one is simply diagonalizing @xmath2 in a truncated basis ; this is the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) .",
    "tda calculates only excited states ; rpa implicitly calculates corrections to the ground state , but is not variational .",
    "hartree - fock ( hf ) and the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) are old topics in nuclear structure , and there is much lore about hf and rpa in textbooks and monographs .",
    "you might think there is nothing new to be learned , at least not about the standard formulations .",
    "nonetheless , it is important to pay attention to several technical issues if one wishes to apply hf+rpa to the no - core shell model :    \\(1 ) _ broken symmetries and their restoration .",
    "_ mean - field calculations can break exact symmetries such as translational and rotational invariance . by breaking an exact symmetry",
    "one often gets a surprising improvement : for example , deformed solutions can be lower in energy than spherical ( rotationally invariant ) solutions .",
    "rpa and broken symmetries have a contentious relationship .",
    "it is often stated that rpa `` restores '' broken symmetries.@xcite more careful and accurate statements can be found in the literature : rpa``treats the inherent symmetries of the problem consistently.''@xcite what does this mean ?",
    "( [ rpaeqn ] ) can be derived by a quadratic expansion of the energy about hf state .",
    "the vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent particle - hole and hole - particle perturbations , respectively , on the hf state ; so for any perturbation corresponding to a generator of an exact symmetry , for example a rotation , the energy ought to be unchanged . in rpa",
    "the _ generators _ of broken symmetries are solutions of eq .",
    "( [ rpaeqn ] ) with @xmath6 . by way of contrast",
    ", tda does not correctly identify broken symmetries as zero - frequency modes .",
    "it is critical to note that the zero - frequency mode can only appear if the model space allows for exact restoration of symmetries , a fact that will return to haunt us .",
    "\\(2 ) _ `` collapse '' of rpa . _",
    "a salient issue is the so - called `` collapse '' of rpa .",
    "rpa assumes small correlations , but in some calculations the rpa corrections are unphysically large .",
    "this can be seen when the hf state is near a transition from a symmetry - conserving state to a symmetry - breaking state , for example , from a spherical to a deformed state .",
    "the transition can be driven by changing a parameter , e.g. single - particle splitting .",
    "the classic illustration of collapse of rpa is the lipkin - meshkov - glick model.@xcite whenever one has symmetry breaking one worries about unphysically large rpa corrections .",
    "\\(3 ) _ multi - shell calculations . _ in a large , multi - shell model space , another symmetry that can be broken in hf is parity ( i.e , by mixing , for example , @xmath7 and @xmath8 single - particle states ) .",
    "while most hf calculations enforce parity conservation , some recent papers report hf with parity mixing.@xcite because of the possibility of `` collapse '' of rpa , however , it must be approached with concern.a specific question is : which is more vulnerable to collapse , deformation or parity mixing ?",
    "we recently developed a code , sherpa@xcite ( shell - model rpa ) , which implements hartree - fock and rpa in occupation space , solving the rpa matrix equations , eq .",
    "( [ rpaeqn ] ) .",
    "the only restriction is the hartree - fock wavefunction must be real ; otherwise we allow for arbitrary deformation and mixing as allowed by the model space .",
    "using the code sherpa and comparing with exact results from the glasgow@xcite and redstick@xcite shell model codes , we have written a series of papers carefully testing rpa in nontrivial shell - model systems.@xcite the shell - model interactions used had dozens of independent parameters , far more complicated than most previous tests ( the lipkin model has only two independent parameters ) .",
    "in the course of applying sherpa to the shell model , we found that many of the common beliefs about rpa were not strictly true . some we discovered through our calculations , others through a careful reading of the original literature .",
    "\\(1 ) _ broken symmetries and `` restoration . ''",
    "_ what the literature actually says is that rpa yields an `` _ _ approximate _ _ restoration of the symmetry''@xcite ( italics added ) ; the restoration is not exact , because the rpa wave function is valid only in the vicinity of the hf state@xcite . as a further investigation , we computed rpa corrections to @xmath9 and other scalar operators.@xcite for a deformed , even - even nucleus , the hf value of @xmath9 is nonzero .",
    "the rpa corrections typically bring this value closer to zero , but not exactly ; and the rpa value of @xmath9 for the ground state can even be negative .",
    "such unphysical values arise because we have taken @xmath9 only to rpa order , neglecting proper treatment of the pauli principle , etc .",
    "\\(2 ) _ phase transitions and `` collapse '' of rpa_. long ago , and mostly forgotten , thouless already correctly pointed out two kinds of phase transitions.@xcite in first - order transition , one has coexisting solutions , each of which are locally stable hf , and there is no collapse of rpa . in a second - order transitions , there is no coexistence , and collapse can occur .",
    "thouless also argues that a first - order transition will occur for even - parity modes , e.g. , quadrupole deformation , while a second - order transition can occur for odd - parity modes .",
    "we present two illustations from the shell model .",
    "the first example , shown in the right side of fig .  1 , is in the @xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath12 or @xmath13 valence space with the wildenthal interaction,@xcite examining the transition from deformed to spherical by lowering the @xmath14 single - particle energy .",
    "we compute the rpa correlation energy@xcite and rpa corrections to scalar observables@xcite .",
    "( rpa is _ usually _ an improvement over hf , but @xmath15 in the spherical regime of @xmath16si is an exception . for other scalars in @xmath16si rpa",
    "is an improvement for both spherical and deformed regimes@xcite . )",
    "rpa does not collapse in this case : it is a second - order transition , because at the transition point both the spherical and deformed hf solutions are _ local _ minima and thus stable .    in the second example , entirely new , we work in the @xmath17-@xmath12 space with a combination of interactions.@xcite here the transition is between hf states of good and mixed parity .",
    "( this turns out to be similar to the lipkin model , where the so - called `` deformed '' state is in fact a state of mixed parity . )",
    "we show our results for @xmath18o , but have similar results for a variety of nuclides both in the @xmath17-@xmath12 space and in a larger @xmath17-@xmath19-@xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath12 space .",
    "the rpa corrections grow unphysically large , a classic but nontrival illustation of `` collapse . ''",
    "this demonstrates that , at least in an explicit @xmath20 space a quadrupole shape transition is first order .",
    "it seems plausible that thouless analysis will continue to hold in multi - shell spaces and that the threat to multi - shell hf+rpa calculations will likely come not from quadrupole deformations but from cross - shell , parity - mixing ( although we have not yet found explicit examples in multi-@xmath21 spaces ) .",
    "we are not the first to apply hf to the no - core shell model .",
    "the pioneering calculations of hasan , vary , and navrtil@xcite ( hvn ) looked at @xmath22he and @xmath18o in spherical hartree - fock , with second - order corrections similar to rpa .",
    "they compared their mean - field calculations to large - basis interacting shell - model ( sm ) calculations in a multi - shell space : for @xmath23he their full interacting shell - model calculations included up to @xmath24 excitations , while for @xmath18o the full calculations included up to @xmath25 excitations .",
    "complete @xmath26 shell - model spaces , when used with translationally invariant interactions , allows one to exactly separate out spurious center - of - mass motion .",
    "one of the main issues of applying hartree - fock to the no - core shell model is the incongruency of model spaces .",
    "( if one works in a @xmath20 space there is no incongruency . ) in the interacting shell model , one can limit the many - body basis to include all @xmath26 excitations .",
    "this is not possible for mean - field theory ; instead one can only define the single - particle space .",
    "for example , @xmath18o in a complete @xmath27 space includes , among others , 4p-4h excitations from the @xmath28 shell into the @xmath29 as well as 1p-1h excitations from the @xmath28 up to @xmath30 .",
    "but if the single - particle space for the hf calculation includes the @xmath30 shell , then the model implicitly includes not only @xmath27 excitations but also @xmath31 as well ; but not _ all _ @xmath32 excitations , that is , the hf space is not a complete @xmath26 space .",
    "this has three consequences .",
    "first , it makes comparison between the interacting shell model and hf ( + rpa ) calculations problematic .",
    "second , there exist `` out - of - space '' two - body matrix elements that appear in the hf space that do not arise in the sm model space ; what value should one assign them ?",
    "third , because the hf+rpa space is not a complete @xmath26 space , spurious center - of - mass motion can not be separated out and will _ not _ appear as a zero - frequency mode in rpa .",
    "hvn made several choices , all plausible but not inarguable .",
    "they made the hf single - particle space smaller in extent than that for the sm calculation ( see their figure 1 ) . because of this",
    "they had few `` out - of - space '' two - body matrix elements , and these were assigned , again plausibly but not inarguably , the relative kinetic energy .",
    "hvn obtained good values for the ground state energies , although with large second - order corrections .",
    "compared to hvn our calculations with sherpa have both an advantage and a disadvantage .",
    "we allow for deformations ( and odd numbers of nucleons , although we did not exploit that here ) , so we can in principle treat any light nucleus .",
    "this leads to a larger computational burden , however , so that in our initial results described here we could only tackle up to @xmath33 spaces .",
    "we also made different choices for the hf+rpa space , taking the same single - particle span as for the sm calculation , and for the out - of - space two - body matrix elements : we set them = 0 .",
    "we considered a number of @xmath34- and @xmath28-shell nuclei : @xmath22he , @xmath35be , @xmath36b , @xmath37c , @xmath38n , and @xmath18o , all in a @xmath33 space , using an effective interaction derived from the bare argonne @xmath39 interaction.@xcite    we present our results in fig .  2 for @xmath40c ;",
    "results for other nuclides were similar .",
    "the ordinate axis is the value of @xmath41 for the harmonic oscillator basis , which sets the length scale ( in no - core methodology one typically scans @xmath42 for best convergence@xcite ) .",
    "the shell - model ( sm ) calculations were performed in an exact @xmath43 space .",
    "it may seem surprising that even the hf values were lower than the exact sm values , but this can happen because the hf calculation can mix in spurious motion .",
    "one signal of the mixing of higher - order excitations is that the hf and rpa states will have spurious center - of - mass contamination , signaled by @xmath44 .",
    "although we can not exactly project out center - of - mass motion , we tried constrained hf by adding @xmath45 to our variational hamiltonian .",
    "we then plotted the ground state energy as a function of @xmath46 ; extrapolating the latter to value zero would then indicate the nonspurious component .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "2b , using a value of @xmath47 mev , and we computed @xmath48 in both hf and hf+rpa .",
    "the results were not very good .",
    "in fact the hf+rpa value of @xmath48 took on unphysical values @xmath49 .",
    "this can happen for two reasons : approximations in rpa itself , and the out - of - space matrix elements we chose to be zero .",
    "in retrospect we strongly suspect the latter , especially when attempting to apply constrained hf ( where even for the added @xmath50 we kept the out - of - space matrix elements zero , with the unintended consequence that one can no longer guarantee that @xmath51 ; we did attempt to remedy this but had problems with consistency we are still attempting to resolve ) , and we plan to redo the calculations using nonzero out - of - space matrix elements .",
    "we have discussed the hartree - fock and random phase approximations , focussing on some hidden bits of lore regarding rpa , and applied hf+rpa to the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model . in particular",
    "we have presented two new results : ( 1 ) comparing , for the first time , in a non - trivial framework ( the interacting shell model ) both first- and second - order transitions , thus illuminating the so - called `` collapse '' of rpa ; and ( 2 ) applying hf+rpa to the no - core shell model with arbitrary deformation and mixing of parity .",
    "the latter is not as successful as previous , spherical calculations , but the failure is likely due to inadequate treatment of center - of - mass and matrix elements in incongruenty model spaces .",
