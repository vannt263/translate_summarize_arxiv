    "the phase singularities are points .",
    "the phase singularities show up at the intersection of equiphases . while turning around a singularity the phase changes by @xmath7 with @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is called the topological charge associated with the phase singularity and its sign is determined by the sign of the phase vortex .",

    "+ the total topological charge present on a surface @xmath11 is defined as the sum of the charges of the singularities located on @xmath11 : @xmath12 . according to stokes theorem , the total topological charge @xmath13 is also equal to the accumulated phase along the contour @xmath14 of surface @xmath11 : @xmath15 in this paper we study the statistics of @xmath13 and their dependence on the degree of disorder in a wave guide .",

    "if we would assume all nodal points @xmath25 to have random charges @xmath26 , with equal probability and independent to each other , we would find that @xmath27 , i.e. the fluctuations are proportional to the surface",

    "indeed it has been shown that zeros with positive charge tend to be surrounded by zeros with negative charge and vice versa @xcite .",
    "topological charges are not independent but tend to be screened , making the fluctuations grow slower than a @xmath28 quadradic law .",

    "+ in previous work , we have shown that 2d and 3d infinite media @xcite reveal a diffuse behaviour as found by wilkinson and freund @xcite .",
    "the role of the mean free path @xmath21 was also studied . in 3d , @xmath22 at large @xmath24 depends very weakly on the mean free path @xmath21 , with a finite value @xmath32 for @xmath33 . for 2d random media @xmath22",

    "one additional reason for us to consider a wave guide is to have a genuine boundary . as a result",
    "the field is confined inside the wave guide so that we are sure not to forget any contribution for the screening process .",
    "finally we will be able to study the influence of boundaries on the screening of topological charge .",
    "we study the dependence of @xmath35 with radius @xmath24 and with mean free path @xmath21 .",
    "we consider a complex random scalar wave field described by circular gaussian statistics ( known to be a good approximation for multiply scattered waves ) @xcite . the medium is a hollow conductive cylindrical wave guide of radius @xmath24 and with infinite length , containing disorder .",
    "the problem is formulated in cylindrical coordinates @xmath36 .",

    "[ modes ] ) of a homogeneous empty conducting cylindrical wave guide of radius @xmath24 and infinite length are given by :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the wave vector , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the @xmath43 root of the first derivative of the @xmath44 bessel function .",

    "the field correlation function @xmath52 is proportional to the imaginary part of the green function @xcite .",
    "hence we can calculate the correlation function between two points separated in angle by @xmath53 and located at same @xmath54 and @xmath55 from :    @xmath56    where the coefficients @xmath57 are given by :    @xmath58    note that for a finite mean free path @xmath21 , the frequencies below the cut - off @xmath59 contribute as well .",

    "this global behaviour is consistent with the calculation for a 3d infinite medium ( green curve ) , with a diffuse behaviour revealing charge screening . on the other hand , near the cut - off frequencies , @xmath22 exhibits sharp resonances reaching a maximal value of @xmath70 for @xmath21 sufficiently large ( i.e. when the limit of eq .",
    "[ corrfield ] is valid , figure 2a ) . for large @xmath71",
    "this makes @xmath35 much bigger than the prediction for a @xmath16 infinite medium .",

    "[ corrfield ] , when @xmath73 the averaged green function is dominated by the two eigen modes @xmath74 so that the field correlation function becomes @xmath75 which exhibits long range order .",
    "then a short analytical calculation using equations [ corrprime ] and [ var ] shows that @xmath76 .",
    "note that we study the limit @xmath77 only with a pedagogical purpose ; a truly homogneous wave guide would not exhibit gaussian statistics .",
    "+ for a finite mean free path @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "2b ) the resonant peaks of @xmath35 are strongly attenuated though still visible until @xmath78 .",
    "the disorder introduces a coupling between the modes and the relative importance of the eigen modes diminishes so that the other modes start to contibute to the field correlation function @xmath52 .",
    "[ mfp ] shows the slow dependence of the peak value of the topological resonance on the mean free path @xmath21 . upon varying 10 orders of magnitude over the mean free path",
    "the fluctuations vary only by 2 orders of magnitude . the maximum value @xmath70 is reached only for very large mean free path and for @xmath79 the peak value is already suppressed by a factor of @xmath80",
    ". +     at different dominant cut - off frequencies ( for @xmath81 and for different @xmath71 ) as a function of the mean free path normalised by the wave guide radius . for @xmath82 , @xmath35 approaches the value predicted for a @xmath16 infinite mediu . only for @xmath21",
    "as large as @xmath83 , the maximum value @xmath84 is reached.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ radius ] , we study how @xmath85 at the cut - off frequency @xmath59 varies with the surface @xmath86 ( with @xmath65 $ ] ) centered inside the wave guide .",
    "this calculation reveals that the large value for @xmath22 is essentially an effect localized near the edge .",
    "the charges are screened in the center of the wave guide but not near the edges .",
    "note that when @xmath71 increases and @xmath25 decreases , the unscreened charges localise closer to the edges .",
    "the direct calculation of topological charge fluctuations reveals a linear dependence of the charge variance on the surface raduis caused by charge screening , and special frequencies for which screening seems absent . for the dominant peaks ( @xmath81 ) , @xmath87 and",
    "hence @xmath88 scales with the surface as if all the charges were independent .",
    "it is also seen in fig .",
    "[ radius ] that these fluctuations mainly come from the edges of the wave guide and that the peak value of the resonances depends on the number of radial node lines @xmath71 and not on the number of angular node lines @xmath25 .",
    "we get deeper insight into this phenomenon using a computer simulation that generates a random circular gaussian complex wave field in a transverse cross - section of the wave guide . to this end",
    "we write : @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath90 are the normalised eigen modes and @xmath91 are randomly generated coefficients obeying a gaussian circular statistics with a variance fixed by : @xmath92 ( to be consistent with eq . [ corrfield1 ] ) .",
    "5a shows the expected screening away from the cut - off frequencies .",
    "5b shows that close to a cut - off frequency , charges tend to be screened in the center but exhibit the same sign near the edges consistently with the result obtained in fig.[radius ] .",
    "+ the twin principle @xcite imposes that if the field is continuous each topological charge is necessarily connected by equiphase lines to a singularity of opposite sign .",
    "this generates the usual charge screening observed in the center , similar to infinite media .",
    "however in the presence of boundaries the twin principle no longer holds and isolated singularities may be created or destroyed at a boundary .",
    "this perturbs the balance between positive and negative charges .",
    "consequently , a huge topological charge can appear in a circular area without an important change in the number of singularities .",
    "away from the cut - off frequencies , these isolated singularities are independent of each other and their number is proportional to the perimeter so that we find @xmath93 .",
    "however at the cut - off frequencies @xmath94 the field is dominated by the weight of the two eigen modes @xmath95 with @xmath71 radial nodal lines that exhibit @xmath71 isolated singularities .",
    "the larger @xmath71 , the more equiphase lines end up at the boundaries and the more singularities have become isolated .",
    "this increases the probability to have many singularities of the same sign , and this probability thus increases the variance @xmath96 . as we can see in fig .",
    "5b these boundary singularities are not independent ( which would give @xmath97 ) but tend to be of the same sign so that @xmath98 for a large mean free path .",
    "the huge fluctuations at special frequencies are thus not due to independent charges in the total surface @xmath11 but to collective effects near the edges .",
    "a superposition of waves scattered by a disordered medium gives rise to a speckle pattern which presents a complicated network of phase vortices .",
    "we have studied the role of mean free path and boundaries on the screening between the topological charges of the phase vortices .",
    "the same linear diffuse law that relates fluctuations of topological charge and enclosed surface , as already found for @xmath16 infinite media , is seen .",
    "however , at the cut - off frequencies of the wave guide , giant fluctuations of the topological charge occur .",
