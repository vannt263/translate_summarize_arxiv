    "( [ phi ] ) as a two - point boundary problem , the initial conditions must include the eigenvalue @xmath168 .",
    "this will , generally , give an unphysical solution for @xmath169 since the normalization condition will not be met . by gradually changing the value of @xmath168 , and redetermining the wave function of the nonlinear gpe using the finite - difference method , we can follow the surface of solutions to eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) until a physical solution is obtained .",
    "numerically , we find the imaginary time split - step relaxation method painfully difficult to converge in 3d for the cigar - shaped geometry that we used in the calculations , both with and without the optical potential . the finite - difference two - point boundary value method appears to be more efficient .",
    "for dynamical simulations , however , we used only the split - step method .",
    "we consider a @xmath170rb condensate with @xmath171 atoms in a harmonic potential with trap frequencies @xmath172 hz and @xmath173 hz , and s - wave scattering length @xmath174 nm . we first consider the case when only the harmonic potential is present ; the action of an optical potential on the trapped bec will be considered below . for the parameters used in the calculations ,",
    "the tf radius in the @xmath2 direction is @xmath175 @xmath168 m , and the chemical potential is @xmath176 j.    figure  [ fig1 ] shows the probability @xmath177 versus @xmath2 , as calculated using eq .",

    "( [ prob_tf ] ) , and a probability @xmath179 found from the numerical solution of the full 3d gpe .",
    "the curve obtained from the 3d gpe lies on top of the tf curve , being nearly undiscernible from it ( it is no surprise that tf is a good approximation for @xmath171 rb atoms in a harmonic trap ) .",
    "clearly , the comparison of the @xmath177 found by means of the approximation developed above with the tf and full 3d results is excellent .",
    "a slight deterioration occurs in the region where the density is low .",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the comparison of @xmath177 with @xmath189 and @xmath179 , where @xmath189 is calculated using eq .",
    "( [ prob_tf ] ) , and with @xmath179 as obtained by solving the stationary 3d gpe .",
    "the tf result still provides an adequate description , despite the fact that the kinetic energy is more important in this case than in the case without the optical potential .",
    "hence we conclude that the kinetic energy remains much less significant than the potential and the mean - field energy in this case .",
    "our method produces results closer to the 3d result than the tf .",
    "the kinetic energy does broaden the wave function in each optical well , hence peaks of the wave functions are lower than in the tf approximation , as evident in fig .",
    "note , however , that our method , being based on a tf - type approximation in the transverse dimension , restricts the diffusion of the wave function due to the kinetic energy to the @xmath2 direction ( but the wave function is definitely squeezed into the transverse dimension due to the optical potential and the mean - field ",
    "see next paragraph ) .",
    "the inset in the figure is a blowup of the region near @xmath190 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows @xmath191 versus @xmath42 and @xmath2 .",
    "a striking aspect of this figure is the extent to which the wave function is squeezed out to larger @xmath42 in the presence of the optical potential . without this potential ,",
    "the size of the wave function in @xmath42 is @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) , but now it is squeezed out to about @xmath194 .",
    "the size of the wave function in the radial direction depends upon @xmath2 , as does the extent of the squeezing in @xmath42 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath195 versus @xmath42 and @xmath2 , as produced by the stationary 3d gpe , is similar to that obtained by our method .",
    "lastly , in fig .  [ fig5 ] we show results of a dynamical calculation in which we varied the optical potential as a function of time , so that the peak strength depended on time as @xmath196 $ ] , with @xmath197 ms and @xmath198 ms . the calculated probability distribution @xmath199 is shown at four different times , viz .",

[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of the probability @xmath199 versus @xmath2 , calculated using the 3d gpe , are similar to that shown in fig .",
    "we have proposed several improvements to the semiclassical description of becs in three dimensions .",
    "first , an ansatz that makes it possible to reduce the corresponding 3d gpe to an effectively 1d equation in the cylindrically symmetric case was put forward .",
    "an interesting feature of this approach is that the corresponding 1d normalization condition , which follows from the standard normalization condition in the full 3d description , takes a non - canonical form , containing the fourth power of the 1d wave function , rather than its square .",
    "also non - canonical is an expression for the probability density of the distribution of the 1d momentum .",
    "these results were further extended to cases when the bec has vorticity , and when cylindrical symmetry is absent ; these cases yield additional examples of non - canonical normalization conditions , sometimes of quite complicated form .",
    "another result , obtained in the framework of the effectively 1d description , is an explicit matching formula between the tf approximation valid in the classically allowed region , and the exponentially vanishing wkb approximation valid in the classically forbidden region . here ,",
    "an exact solution to a problem , found long ago in an abstract mathematical context , determines the arbitrary constant in front of the exponentially decaying wkb wave function .    to verify the validity of analytical approximations developed in this work , we have performed direct numerical calculations of bound states and of dynamics in a time - depenendent potential , and compared the probability distributions obtained with full 3d results .",
    "the comparison shows that the analytical approximations are quite accurate .",
