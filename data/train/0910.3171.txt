    "due to its occurrence in a wide range of natural phenomena and its fundamental importance for surface engineering @xcite , the behavior of liquid drops on solid surfaces is an active field of research @xcite .",
    "individual droplets can serve as ideal chemical reactors @xcite , carriers of information @xcite or in ink - jet printers as well as surface preparation prior to painting or coating .",
    "although there exist a few solids that are molecularly flat ( e.g.  mica ) , most of solids are rough on the micro scale @xcite so that the well known young s law , @xmath0 @xcite , must be modified in order to take account of surface roughness . here , @xmath1 is the contact angle on a flat substrate and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the liquid - vapor , solid - liquid and solid - vapor specific surface free energies , respectively .",
    "the simplest and most popular modification of the young s law for rough surfaces dates back to the works of wenzel @xcite and cassie and baxter @xcite , where the effect of roughness on wetting is assumed to be a mere change of the average surface areas involved in the problem .    assuming that the liquid completely penetrates into the roughness grooves ( collapsed state ) , wenzel obtained @xmath5 for the apparent contact angle @xmath6 ( the roughness factor @xmath7 is the real solid area within a square of unit length ) .",
    "cassie and baxter , on the other hand , considered the case of a droplet pending on the top of roughness tips ( suspended state ) and obtained @xmath8 where the roughness density @xmath9 gives the fraction of the droplet s base area , which is in contact with the solid .",
    "it is important to realize that both the wenzel and the cassie - baxter equations do not explicitly take account of three phase contact line structure .",
    "this shortcoming may , however , be neglected as long as the contact area reflects the structure and energetics of the three phase contact line @xcite .",
    "the suspended state is often separated from the wenzel state by a finite free energy barrier , which depends both on the droplet size and roughness characteristics @xcite . on a rough hydrophobic substrate ,",
    "the apparent contact angle of a droplet in the suspended state is typically higher than in the collapsed state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the contact angle hysteresis significantly increases when a suspended droplet undergoes a transition to the wenzel state @xcite .",
    "indicative of stronger pinning @xcite of the three phase contact line , this feature reflects itself in a sticky behavior of liquid drops in the collapsed state @xcite as compared to their high mobility in the suspended state .",
    "while droplet behavior on homogeneous roughness has widely been investigated in the literature , only few works exist dealing with the case of _ inhomogeneous _ topography @xcite .",
    "indeed , experimental observation of a roughness gradient induced spontaneous motion is not an easy task @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite , for example , resort to shaking vertically the substrate in order to overcome pinning forces .",
    "recently , a two - dimensional theoretical model is proposed aiming at a study of the present topic @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "however , computer simulations of the problem are lacking so far .",
    "the present work is aimed at filling this gap .",
    "we provide first direct numerical evidence for spontaneous droplet motion actuated by a gradient of pillar density .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the influence of specific distribution / arrangement of roughness elements ( pillars in our case ) on the behavior of the droplet .",
    "an important observation is that , depending on the specific arrangement of the pillars , both complete arrest and motion over the entire gradient zone can be observed for the same gradient of pillar density .",
    "this underlines the importance of the topography design for achieving high mobility drops .    for the case of mobile drops",
    ", we provide a simple model for the dependence of drop velocity on pillar density difference @xmath10 .",
    "the model accounts for the observed linear dependence and predicts further that the velocity should scale linearly with the liquid - vapor surface tension .",
    "this prediction is also in line with our computer simulations for the studied range of parameters .",
    "we employ a free energy based two phase lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method , first proposed by swift @xcite . after establishing the galilean invariance @xcite , it was developed further @xcite in order to take the wetting effect of the solid substrate into account .",
    "since then , the approach has been used to study e.g.  stability and dynamics of droplets on topographically patterned hydrophobic substrates @xcite , effect of chemical surface patterning on droplet dynamics @xcite as well as chemical gradient induced separation of emulsions @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the method can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness , however , we present a short overview of the method . equilibrium properties of the present model can be obtained from a free energy functional @xmath11 in eq .",

    "the critical density , pressure , and temperature are set to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively .",

    "the surface free energy per unit area , @xmath32 , is approximated as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the density of fluid on the solid substrate and @xmath35 is a constant which can be used to tune the contact angle . minimizing the free energy functional @xmath36 , eq .",

    "the parameter @xmath35 is related to the young contact angle via @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath1 is the equilibrium young contact angle and the function `` sign '' determines the sign of its argument .",
    "all the quantities in this paper are given in dimensionless lattice boltzmann units .",
    "the lb relaxation time is set to @xmath41 and the temperature is fixed to @xmath42 . for a typical choice of @xmath43 , for example , this leads to the equilibrium liquid and vapor densities @xmath44 4.1 and @xmath45 2.9 .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in the @xmath49 and @xmath50-directions .",
    "as mentioned above , in the experimental reports which have considered the motion of a suspended droplet on surfaces with a gradient of texture , the behavior of droplets is not unique @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the roughness factor as well as the roughness density are not sufficient for a full characterization of a rough surface .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ eq : cassie ] ) predicts a decrease of the effective contact angle upon an increase of roughness density and hence a driving force along the gradient of @xmath9 , the contact angle hysteresis  @xcite may be strong enough in order to prevent a spontaneous droplet motion @xcite .",
    "the present work underlines this aspect by explicitly showing that the behavior of a droplet on substrates patterned by pillar microstructure with the same pillar density gradient , but different pillar geometries ( e.g.  rectangular posts with different pillar width and spacing ) can be qualitatively different . while in the one case the droplet spontaneously moves due to the roughness gradient induced driving force , it may become arrested if an unfavorable geometry is chosen .    a simple way to study the effect of a gradient texture is to introduce an abrupt ( stepwise ) change in the roughness ( pillar ) density along a given spatial direction . adopting this choice",

    "<S> the effect of a step wise change in the pillar density on the dynamics of droplets is investigated via three - dimensional lattice boltzmann simulations . for the same pillar density gradient but different pillar arrangements , both motion over the gradient zone as well as complete arrest are observed . in the moving case , </S>",
    "<S> the droplet velocity scales approximately linearly with the texture gradient . </S>",
    "<S> a simple model is provided reproducing the observed linear behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the model also predicts a linear dependence of droplet velocity on surface tension . this prediction is clearly confirmed via our computer simulations for a wide range of surface tensions . </S>"
