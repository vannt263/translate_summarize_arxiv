    "the relevant equations have been solved for the bcs - type hamiltonian : each single - particle level has a distinct set of quantum numbers corresponding to the symmetries of the pairing operator , thus a level could only be paired with its time - reversed partner .",
    "the validity of the theory has been proved on a large ensemble with random interactions @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the general situation of the hfb - type hamiltonian , where several single - particle levels could have the same set of quantum numbers and pairing among them is allowed .",
    "the method should cost much less time in computing compared with the traditional variational calculation . in the algorithm of the current theory",
    "only the one - body density matrices on the pair condensate are calculated , whereas the variation principle needs the two - body density matrices in computing the expectation value of a two - body hamiltonian .    in sec .",
