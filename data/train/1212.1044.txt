    "<S> using langevin dynamics simulations , we investigate the dynamics of polymer translocation into a circular nanocontainer through a nanopore under a driving force @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the translocation probability initially increases and then saturates with increasing @xmath0 , independent of @xmath1 , which is the average density of the whole chain in the nanocontainer . </S>",
    "<S> the translocation time distribution undergoes a transition from a gaussian distribution to an asymmetric distribution with increasing @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find a nonuniversal scaling exponent of the translocation time as chain length , depending on @xmath1 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are interpreted by the conformation of the translocated chain in the nanocontainer and the time of an individual segment passing through the pore during translocation . </S>"
