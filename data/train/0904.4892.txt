    "the lifshitz theory describes dispersion interaction between an atom or a molecule and a cavity wall which is caused by quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . at separations from a few angstroms to a few nanometers the interaction of an atom with a wall is of nonrelativistic character . in this separation region",

    "it is well known that the lifshitz theory faces problems when the drift current of conduction electrons is taken into account in the model of the dielectric response ( see the review in ref .  ) .",
    "these problems , connected with the violation of the third law of thermodynamics ( the nernst heat theorem ) and contradictions between the theoretical predictions and experimental data , where mostly discussed in the case of two material plates . here , we consider the complicated problems arising in the lifshitz theory of atom - wall interaction which are connected with the description of free charge carrirs in the wall material . in sec .  2 we review known results for the casimir - polder free energy and entropy of atom - wall interaction in the limit of low temperatures .",
    "we show that for metallic walls theory is thermodynamically consistent , whereas for dielectric walls it is consistent with thermodynamics only if the dc conductivity of wall material is neglected in the model of the dielectric response .",

    "the dc conductivity is usually taken into account by means of the drude - like term @xmath31 here , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dc conductivity and @xmath34 is the relaxation parameter of free electrons .",
    "the substitution of the permittivity ( [ eq8 ] ) into the lifshitz formula ( [ eq1 ] ) leads to only negligible additions to all terms with @xmath35 .",

    "the contradiction between the lifshitz theory of atom - wall interaction with included dc conductivity of the wall and thermodynamics is explained by the violation of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the drift current of charge carriers @xmath42 incorporated in the permittivity ( [ eq8 ] ) leads to joule s heating of the wall ( ohmic losses).@xcite then to preserve the temperature constant , one should admit the existence of an unidirectional flux of heat from the wall to the heat bath.@xcite such fluxes are excluded in the state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "in fact the drift current is irreversible process which goes with an increase of entropy and brings a system out of thermal equilibrium .",

    "similar results can be also obtained using the drude model for the description of the metal.@xcite the reason is that for metals not the tm reflection coefficient at @xmath48 , but the te one leads to the discontinuity in the zero - frequency contribution to the lifshitz formula.@xcite however , for an atom - wall interaction the te reflection coefficient at zero frequency in eq .",

    "small corrections to these results depending on atomic and material properties ( @xmath18 and @xmath54 ) are obtained in ref .  .",
    "for us it is only important that the entropy in eq .",

    "important experimental test for the role of dc conductivity in the interaction of atoms with a dielectric wall was performed in ref .  .",
    "this is the measurement of the thermal casimir - polder force through center - of - mass oscillations of the trapped bose - einstein condensate . in that experiment",

    "was considered as a dielectric with finite static dielectric permittivity @xmath26 . under this assumption , computations using the lifshitz formula ( [ eq1 ] ) and respective expression for situations out of thermal equilibrium@xcite demonstrated a very good agreement between experiment and theory at a 70% confidence level . however , as was discussed in sec .",

    "the fractional frequency difference @xmath65 was recalculated both in equilibrium and out of thermal equilibrium by taking into account a nonzero dc conductivity of fused silica in accordance to eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "it was shown that the inclusion of the dc conductivity leads to drastically different theoretical results both in thermal equilibrium and out of thermal equilibrium which are in disagreement with the measurement data .    in fig .  1",

    "the arms of the crosses indicate the experimental errors determined individually at each data point at a 70% confidence level.@xcite the solid and dashed lines show the theoretical results computed with neglect and inclusion of the dc conductivity , respectively .",
    "importantly , the obtained results with included dc conductivity do not depend on its magnitude , but only on the fact that it is nonzero . as is seen in fig",
    ".  1 , the first two experimental points are in clear disagreement with the dashed line taking into account the conductivity of fused silica .",
    "similar conclusions are obtained in situations out of thermal equilibrium . in fig .",
    "2(a , b ) the same information , as in fig .  1 , is provided for wall temperatures @xmath62k and 605k , respectively . as is seen in fig .  2 , in nonequilibrium situations the disagreement between the experimental data shown as crosses and the theory taking into account the dc conductivity of a sio@xmath25 wall ( the dashed lines ) further widens .",

    "in the foregoing we have discussed problems in the lifshitz theory of atom - wall interaction connected with the description of free charge carriers in wall material . it was shown that in the case of metallic walls this does not create any problem .",
    "as to dielectric walls , thermodynamically and experimentally consistent results are obtained when the dc conductivity of wall material is neglected .",
    "the inclusion of the dc conductivity into the model of dielectric response results in the violation of the nernst heat theorem and in contradictions with experimental data . similar situation also holds in recently proposed theoretical approaches attempting to include in the lifshitz theory the screening effects and diffusion currents . for metallic walls",
    "this does not create problems , but leads to contradictions with thermodynamics for wide classes of dielectrics .",
    "consistent theoretical description of atom - wall interaction in the case of dielectric walls uses the rule that the dc conductivity of dielectric material should be neglected.@xcite    this rule should be considered as a phenomenological one , but it can be justified in terms of most basic physical concepts on the subject .",
    "the point is that the physical phenomenon of dispersion forces occurs in thermal equilibrium and is caused by the fluctuating electromagnetic field .",
    "the latter can not transmit energy in only one direction from the field to charge carriers , heat the wall material and create in homogeneous media the nonhomogeneous concentrations of charges resulting in the screening and diffusion effects .",
    "all these phenomena are of irreversible character , lead to an increase of the entropy and can occur in external electric field .",
    "thus , we get the conclusion that there is a fundamental difference between the fluctuating electromagnetic field ( including its `` static component''@xcite ) and external electric field . the discussed above problems in both the standard formulation of the lifshitz theory of atom - wall interaction and its generalization including the screening effects arise when the properties of external field are attributed to the fluctuating field in an unjustified way .",

    "<S> we review the low - temperature behavior of the free energy and entropy of dispersion interaction for both dielectric and metallic walls . consistency of the obtained results with thermodynamics and experimental data is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> recent attempts to include the screening effects and diffusion currents into the lifshitz theory are considered . </S>",
