    "years after the first disagreement between data  @xcite and the colour - singlet model ( csm )  @xcite , the problem of heavy - quarkonium production in particular at the tevatron is still with us . indeed , it is widely accepted now that fragmentation processes , through the colour - octet mechanism ( com )  @xcite dominate the production of heavy quarkonia in high - energy hadronic collisions , even for @xmath0 as low as 6 gev . in the com , one then parametrises the non - perturbative transition from octet to singlet by unknown matrix elements , which are determined to reproduce the data .",
    "however , fragmentation processes are known to produce mostly transversely - polarised vector mesons at large transverse momentum  @xcite and , in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 cases , this seems in contradiction with the measurements from cdf  @xcite . for a comprehensive review on the subject",
    ", the reader may refer to  @xcite .",
    "we therefore reconsider the basis of quarkonium ( @xmath3 ) production in field theory , and concentrate on @xmath1 and @xmath2 production .",
    "we shall see that new contributions are present in the lowest - order diagrams , and we shall also explain how one can build a consistent and systematic scheme to go beyond the static approximation . to this end , we shall use 3-point vertices depending on the relative momentum of the constituent quarks and normalised to the leptonic width of the meson .",
    "we shall show that , in order to preserve gauge invariance , it is required to introduce vertices more complicated than the 3-point vertex .",
    "finally , we shall see that our formalism can be easily applied to the production of excited states . in the case of @xmath2 ,",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are unexpectedly large and allow agreement with the data .",
    "all the information needed to study processes involving bound states , such as decay and production mechanisms , can be parametrised by vertex functions , which describe the coupling of the bound state to its constituents and contain the information about its size , the amplitude of probability for given quark configurations and the normalisation of its wave function . in the case of heavy quarkonia , the situation simplifies as they can be approximated by their lowest fock state , made of a heavy quark and an antiquark , combined to obtain the proper quantum numbers .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown  @xcite that , for light _ vector _",
    "mesons , the dominant projection operator is @xmath4 and we expect this to hold even better for heavy vector mesons as this approximation gets better in the case of @xmath5 .",
    "the transition @xmath6 can then be described by the following 3-point function : @xmath7 with @xmath8 the total momentum of the bound state , and @xmath9 the relative momentum of the bound quarks , as drawn in figure  [ fig : bs_vertex_phenoa ] .",
    "this choice amounts to describing the vector meson as a massive photon with a non - local coupling .",
    "we do not assume that the quarks are on - shell : their momentum distribution comes from @xmath10 and from their propagators . in order to make contact with wave functions , and also to simplify calculations , we assume that @xmath10 can be taken as a function of the square of the relative c.m .",
    "3-momentum @xmath11 of the quarks , which can be written in a lorentz invariant form as @xmath12 . for the functional form of @xmath10 , we neglect possible cuts , and choose two otherwise extreme scenarios : a dipolar form which decreases slowly with @xmath13 , and a gaussian form : @xmath14 both with a normalisation @xmath15 and a size parameter @xmath16 , which can be obtained from relativistic quark models  @xcite .",
    "we shall see in section 4 how we fix the latter using the leptonic - decay width .",
    "in high - energy hadronic collisions , quarkonia are produced at small @xmath17 , where protons are mainly made of gluons .",
    "hence gluon fusion is the main production mechanism . in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "a final - state gluon emission is required to conserve @xmath18 parity .",
    "this gluon also provides the @xmath3 with transverse momentum @xmath0 .",
    "we assume here that we can use collinear factorisation to describe the initial gluons , and hence that the final - state gluon emission is the unique source of @xmath0 .",
    "all the relevant diagrams for the lowest - order gluon - initiated production process can be obtained from that of figure  [ fig : landau ] by crossing .",
    "there are six of them .",
    "these diagrams have discontinuities , which generate their imaginary parts .",
    "in order to find these , we can use the landau equations  @xcite .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the diagram of figure  [ fig : landau ] , for which the landau equations become : @xmath19 with @xmath20 the quark mass .",
    "these equations have only two solutions in the physical region : one which is always present and gives a cut which starts at @xmath21 , shown in figure  [ fig : diag_lo_qcd ]  ( a ) , corresponding to a cut through the two @xmath22-channel propagators , and another one when the meson mass @xmath23 is larger or equal to @xmath24 ( see figure  [ fig : diag_lo_qcd ]  ( b ) : this corresponds to a cut through the two propagators touching the meson ) .",
    "the latter leads to the colour - singlet model  @xcite , which assumes that the quarks should be put on - shell to make the meson .",
    "the former cut has not been considered so far for the description of inclusive production .",
    "let us mention however that similar cuts are dominant in diffractive production of vector mesons  @xcite , or in dvcs  @xcite .",
    "we are going to consider this @xmath22-channel cut in detail . to avoid complications , we choose quark masses @xmath25 high enough for the second cut not to contribute .",
    "this will also simplify the normalisation procedure for the vertex .",
    "the first problem one immediately faces when evaluating the diagrams offigure  [ fig : diag_lo_qcd ]  ( a ) is that of gauge invariance : whereas these diagrams are gauge invariant if we have a photon instead of a @xmath3 , they are not for a finite - size object .",
    "indeed , the vertex function @xmath10 takes different values in diagrams where either the on - shell quark or the antiquark touches the @xmath3 : the relative momentum @xmath26 is then either @xmath27 or @xmath28 , so that the delicate cancellation that ensures current conservation is spoilt .",
    "the reason is easily understood : if one considers a local vertex , then the gluon can only couple to the quarks that enter the vertex . for a non - local vertex , it is possible for the gluon to connect to the quark or gluon lines inside the vertex , as shown in figure  [ fig : illus_gi_break ] ( b ) , for @xmath29 , no gluon emission is kinematically allowed and the diagrams are directly gauge - invariant . ] .",
    "these contributions must generate a 4-point @xmath30 vertex , @xmath31 .",
    "in general , its form is unknown , but it must obey some general constraints  @xcite :    * it must restore gauge invariance : its addition to the amplitude must lead to current conservation at the gluon vertex ; * it must obey crossing symmetry ( or invariance by @xmath18 conjugation ) which can be written @xmath32 * it must not introduce new singularities absent from the propagators or from @xmath10 , hence it can only have denominators proportional to @xmath33 or @xmath34 ; * it must vanish in the case of a local vertex @xmath35 , hence we multiply it by @xmath36 .",
    "these conditions are all fulfilled by the following choice  @xcite : @xmath37\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times&\\left[\\frac{c_{1\\nu}}{(c_2+p)^2-m^2 } + \\frac{c_{2\\nu}}{(c_1-p)^2-m^2}\\right]\\gamma_\\mu \\label{gamma4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the indices of the colour matrix @xmath38 are defined in figure  [ fig : gamma_4 ] , and @xmath39 is the strong coupling constant .",
    ".,width=113 ]    it must be noted first that the quark pair @xmath40 that makes the meson is now in a colour - octet state .",
    "we thus recover the necessity of such configurations , in this case to restore gauge invariance . we must also point out that this choice of vertex is not unique .",
    "we postpone a full study of the 4-point vertex ambiguity  @xcite to another paper .    when taken into account in the calculation of the discontinuity of @xmath41",
    ", @xmath42 introduces two new diagrams on the right is zero due to charge conjugation . ] shown in figure  [ fig : lo_new_diag ] . including these contributions in the calculation of the amplitude , we obtain a gauge - invariant quantity .",
    "we define @xmath43 , @xmath44 ... , 6 , as the unintegrated amplitude given by the usual feynman rules for the four diagrams of  figure  [ fig : diag_lo_qcd ]  ( a ) and the two of  figure  [ fig : lo_new_diag ] .",
    "we choose the loop momentum @xmath45 so that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we then have for the imaginary part of the physical amplitude @xmath48 : @xmath49    this polarised partonic amplitude is thus obtained by contracting @xmath43 with the polarisation vectors of the gluons @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and with that of the vector meson @xmath53 , by integrating on the internal phase space restricted by the cutting rules and by summing the six contributions from the diagrams of figure  [ fig : diag_lo_qcd ]  ( a ) and figure  [ fig : lo_new_diag ] .",
    "the complete expressions of the polarisation vectors are as follows .",
    "one of the transverse polarisations can be taken as orthogonal to the plane of the collision : @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the other transverse polarisation can be taken as @xmath56 for the two gluons , and as @xmath57 for the final - state gluon and for the vector meson , where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the mandelstam variables for the partonic process .",
    "finally , the longitudinal vector - meson polarisation can be taken as @xmath61    to complete the calculation of the amplitude , we need to normalise the 3-point vertex function @xmath62 .",
    "we use here the leptonic decay width to fix this normalisation  @xcite .    the width in terms of the decay amplitude",
    "is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the two - particle phase space  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude is obtained as usual through feynman rules . at lowest order in @xmath65",
    ", only the 3-point vertex function needs to be considered ( giving an explicitly gauge invariant answer ) .",
    "the square of the amplitude is then obtained from the diagram drawn in  figure  [ fig : decay_diag_1 ] .    in terms of the sub - amplitudes @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "defined in figure  [ fig : decay_diag_1 ] , we have : @xmath69 where the factor @xmath70 comes from the sum over polarisations of the meson and the factor @xmath71 from the averaging over the initial polarisations .",

    "@xmath81 is a function of @xmath16 through the vertex function @xmath82 and is not in general computable analytically , but it is straightforward to get its numerical value .     in the @xmath1 case as a function of @xmath16 : left ( resp .",

    "( [ eq : lept_width ] ) and ( [ eq : decomp_ampl_inv_decay ] ) to determine @xmath15 from the measured leptonic width .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : n_jpsi_lam ] the result in the @xmath1 case .",
    "as can be seen , the normalisation of the vertex depends rather strongly on @xmath83 and @xmath16 , but very little on the assumed functional dependence of the vertex function .",
    "we shall see later that once @xmath15 is determined from the leptonic rate , the production cross section depends little on these uncertainties .",
    "we can now evaluate the production cross section from the @xmath22-channel cut . as stated before",
    ", we assume that collinear factorisation can be used , in which case the link between the partonic and the hadronic cross sections is given by the following general formula : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the momentum fractions of the incoming gluons , @xmath87 is the momentum of the meson in the c.m .",
    "frame of the colliding hadrons , @xmath88 is the gluon distribution function taken at the scale @xmath89 .    in the c.m .",
    "frame of the colliding hadrons , introducing the rapidity @xmath90 and the transverse momentum @xmath91 , we obtain the double - differential cross section in @xmath0 and @xmath92 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : edsdp3 ] ) : @xmath93    at this stage , we can perform the integration on @xmath86 ( or @xmath85 ) using the delta function .    in terms of the transverse energy @xmath94",
    ", we get @xmath95 so that we obtain @xmath96 the double differential cross section on @xmath0 and @xmath92 then takes the following form : @xmath97 where @xmath98 corresponds to @xmath99 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : x1x2 ] ) : @xmath100    the last step is to relate the partonic differential cross section @xmath101 to the amplitude calculated from our model . to this end , we use the well - known formula : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the squared polarised partonic amplitude for @xmath104 , averaged only over colour for polarised cross sections , and where @xmath26 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath22 are the helicities of the four particles",
    ".    as we are concerned with polarisation only for the @xmath3 , we sum over gluon polarisations and define , for @xmath107 : @xmath108    finally , we have the double - differential polarised cross section on @xmath0 and @xmath92 : @xmath109",
    "before presenting our results , we need to choose a value for @xmath16 and @xmath83 .",
    "several studies have shown , in the context of relativistic quark models @xcite , that the scale of the vertex function is between 1.42 and 2.6 gev , and that @xmath83 is between 1.42 and 1.87 gev .",
    "we choose here a value of @xmath16 in the middle range , @xmath110 gev ( we shall see that small variations do not affect our results much ) , and a value of @xmath83 equals to the @xmath111 mass , @xmath83=1.87 gev , in order to have a coherent treatment of all stable charmonium states",
    ".    setting @xmath112 to 1800 gev and considering the cross section in the pseudorapidity range @xmath113 , we get the following results for @xmath1 production at cdf .",
    "the first plot  ( see figure  [ fig : g_m187_l183_mrst ]  ( a ) ) shows our result ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) for @xmath117 gev and @xmath110  gev .",
    "these new contributions are compared with the usual lo csm  @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that ( in the feynman gauge ) the main contribution comes from the 3-point function ( eq .  ( [ vf ] ) ) . as can be seen from figure  [ fig : g_m187_l183_mrst ]  ( b ) , the term that restores gauge invariance ( eq .  ( [ gamma4 ] ) ) contributes little : the square of its amplitude ( see figure  [ fig : illus_gi_break ] ( b ) ) is about 10 times smaller than the square of the amplitude containing only a 3-point vertex ( see figure  [ fig : illus_gi_break ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "furthermore , the interference term between the diagrams of figure  [ fig : illus_gi_break ]  ( a ) and that of figure  [ fig : illus_gi_break ]  ( b ) is negative , so that the effect of eq .",
    "( [ gamma4 ] ) is to reduce the total amplitude squared . in figures  [ fig :",
    "gipa_jpsi_comp1 ] , we show that the normalisation of the results using the decay width has removed most dependence on the choice of parameters we have less than a factor 2 at @xmath118 gev and a factor 3 at @xmath119 gev . ] .",
    "interestingly , as figure 11 ( b ) shows , the dependence on @xmath16 is negligible once values of the order of 1.4 gev are taken .",
    "we see that the contribution of the new cut matters at large @xmath0 .",
    "noteworthily , it is much flatter in @xmath0 than the lo csm , and its polarisation is mostly longitudinal .",
    "this could have been expected as scalar products of @xmath120 with momenta in the loop will give an extra @xmath121 contribution , or equivalently an extra @xmath0 power in the amplitude , compared to scalar products involving @xmath122 .",
    "one can show that , for @xmath110 gev , @xmath123 gev and for mrst structure functions , the longitudinal cross section falls as @xmath124 , whereas the transverse cross section behaves asymptotically as @xmath125 .",
    "the asymptotic power of @xmath126 changes by 5 % for @xmath16 varying between 1.4 and 2.2 gev .",
    "recall that in our calculation the lo csm is zero because @xmath127 . for @xmath128",
    ", we should have added our contribution to that of the lo csm at the amplitude level .",
    "the net result would then be flatter and larger .",
    "however , it is clear that the enhancement factor would not be large enough to reach agreement with the data .",
    "although the normalisation to the leptonic width removes most of the ambiguities in the @xmath1 case , it is not so for radially excited states , such as the @xmath2 . indeed ,",
    "in this case , the vertex function must have a node .",
    "we expect it to appear through a pre - factor , @xmath129 , multiplying the @xmath130 vertex function .",
    "explicitly , @xmath131 , for a node @xmath132 should be well parametrised by @xmath133    in order to determine the node position in momentum space , we can fix @xmath132 from its known value in position space , _",
    "e.g. _  from potential studies , and take the fourier transform of the wave function",
    ". however , the position of the node is not very well - known , and it is unclear how to relate our vertex with off - shell quarks to an on - shell non - relativistic wave function .",
    "the most remarkable thing is that , because the integrand has a zero , the integral @xmath81 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) entering the decay width calculation can vanish for a certain value @xmath134 , which turns out to be close to the estimated value of the zero in the wave function . because of their different momentum dependence , the integrals that control the production are not zero for @xmath134 .",
    "hence our normalisation procedure can in principle produce an infinite answer .",
    "of course , this means that one can not be at @xmath134 exactly .",
    "however , if one is close to it , then it becomes possible to produce a large normalisation .",
    "hence in the @xmath2 case , our procedure can produce agreement with the data at low @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : g_psip_a1334_0 - 0 ] shows that for @xmath135 gev , one obtains a good fit to cdf data at moderate @xmath0 ( note that the slopes are quite similar .",
    "this is at odds with what is commonly assumed since fragmentation processes with a typical @xmath136 behaviour can also describe the data ) .",
    "the @xmath2 is predicted to be mostly longitudinal .",
    "this effect of the node in the @xmath2 vertex function could also solve the @xmath137 puzzle as suggested in  @xcite , since a slight modification in the integrand of @xmath81 can produce a large suppression in the @xmath137 decay of the @xmath2 .",
    "such a modification in the integrand is indeed expected to come from the presence of an off - shell @xmath138 in the @xmath137 decay instead of an off - shell photon for the leptonic decay . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath1 , no important effect",
    "are expected .",
    "in this letter , we have shown that there are two singularities in the box diagram contribution to quarkonium production .",
    "we have chosen quark masses so that only the @xmath22-channel singularity ( which is usually neglected ) contributes , and vertices without cuts .",
    "on the theoretical side , we have begun to map the ingredients needed to go beyond the static approximation @xmath29 .",
    "they involve the introduction of new 4-point vertices that restore gauge invariance .",
    "we postpone a full study of these to a later publication  @xcite .    on the phenomenological side",
    ", we have shown that in the @xmath1 case , this new singularity produces results comparable to those of the lowest - order csm , _ i.  e. _  too small to accommodate the tevatron data . in the @xmath2 case",
    ", ambiguities in the position of the node of the vertex function can lead to an enhancement , and to an agreement with the data .",
    "hence it is not clear that the same mechanism has to be at work for @xmath130 and @xmath139 mesons .",
    "our approach can be used in the case of @xmath140 waves , where we would simply input a suitable 3-point vertex instead of taking higher derivatives of the wave function and of the perturbative amplitude , but also in a @xmath141-factorisation framework @xcite ( which would enhance the cross section in the @xmath1 case ) , and can be combined with contribution from com fragmentation . because the quarkonium are mostly longitudinal in this work and transverse in fragmentation , it seems possible to reach agreement with polarisation data .",
