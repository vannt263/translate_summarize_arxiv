    "the nearby m81 group provides an ideal testbed for studies of dwarf galaxies and the effects of interactions between galaxies .",
    "thanks to its proximity , it is one of the best studied groups , both regarding the interaction between its three luminous galaxies ( m81 , m82 and ngc3077 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the studies of individual group members , notably several of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite recently conducted a blind hi survey of the m81 group using a multibeam receiver on the 76m lovell telescope with a resultant beamsize of @xmath8 12 .",
    "interestingly , only one new object was discovered in their observations , hijass j1021 + 6842 , which is the subject of this letter .",
    "this implies that the census of galaxies with hi gas in the m81 group must be nearly complete down to hi masses of order 10@xmath9 m@xmath2 .",
    "hijass j1021 + 6842 lies at an angular distance of @xmath10 ( or a minimum separation of 110 kpc at the distance of m81 ) from ic2574 .",
    "the proximity in sky position and radial velocity between ic2574 and hijass j1021 + 6842 implies that hijass j1021 + 6842 is a probable member of the m81 group at a distance of @xmath11mpc and a possible companion of ic2574 at a distance of @xmath11mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite noted the lack of an optical counterpart for hijass j1021 + 6842 in the second  generation red digital sky survey , and speculated that it may be either a very low surface brightness companion of ic2574 , or the debris of a tidal encounter between ic2574 and one of the galaxies around m81 .",
    "thus , hijass j1021 + 6842 is an intrinsically interesting object , and potentially a key object for understanding the process of galaxy formation from tidal debris .",
    "the present higher resolution hi observations provide a requisite first step to understanding the true nature of this object .",
    "we used the nrao very large array ( vla ) to obtain hi spectral line observations of hijass j1021 + 6842 in the d configuration ( integration time : 106 minutes ) and in the c configuration ( 148 minutes ) in 2004 .",
    "we observed 0841 + 708 as the complex gain calibrator and 0542 + 498 ( 3c147 ) and 1331 + 305 ( 3c286 ) as flux and bandpass calibrators .",
    "the spectra consisted of 128 channels with a width of 5.2  kms@xmath12 ( after on  line hanning smoothing ) .",
    "the data were analyzed using standard calibration / mapping tasks in the aips software package .",
    "four channels near velocities of 0  kms@xmath12 were contaminated by galactic foreground emission ( see fig .  [ mosaic ] ) . to calculate the integrated hi map ( moment 0 ) we carefully inspected and blanked consecutive channel maps to remove the extended galactic emission from the data cube . in doing",
    "so we are helped by the fact that smoothly distributed emission , such as that due to foreground galactic hi , is filtered out in interferometric observations .    given the intrinsically faint hi emission of hijass j1021 + 6842",
    ", images were made with a uvtaper of 5.3 k@xmath13 to emphasize weak , extended structures .",
    "this resulted in a beamsize of @xmath14 ( 60@xmath15=1.17kpc ) and an rms of 0.8mjybeam@xmath12 per channel .",
    "given the considerable extent of the hi emission , it was important to correct for primary beam attenuation in all subsequent , quantitative analysis .",
    "figure  [ mosaic ] shows a mosaic of 12 channel maps ( before primary beam correction ) stepped at every other channel .",
    "this mosaic shows that hi is detected from @xmath16 @xmath1750 to @xmath16@xmath1870 kms@xmath12 in radial velocity , which is a larger range in velocity than the fwhm of @xmath8 50 kms@xmath12 reported by @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the synthesis observations have allowed us to overcome confusion with galactic hi emission , enabling us to detect hi at velocities near 0  kms@xmath12 and lower velocities .",
    "additionally , the higher resolution imaging shows that the single source discovered by @xcite breaks up into several regions of emission .",
    "there is a radial velocity gradient with positive velocities in the eastern components and negative velocities in the western components .",
    "what is particularly striking about these images is the fact that the hi is extended over more than 30kpc which makes hijass j1021 + 6842 bigger than even the most massive dwarf galaxies in the m81 group ( e.g. , ic2574 : @xcite hoii : @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ mom0 ] shows a map of the total hi column density of hijass j1021 + 6842 .",
    "we identify seven regions of emission ( labeled i  vii in fig .",
    "[ mom0 ] ) .",
    "the maximum hi column density is found in region vi and corresponds to @xmath19 atoms @xmath4 .",
    "region iii is a marginal detection and needs follow up observations .",
    "the total hi emission shown in fig .",
    "[ mom0 ] corresponds to a total hi mass of 1.5 @xmath0 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 .",
    "this is considerably larger than the value reported by @xcite .",
    "we attribute the difference to the fact that most of the emission is situated in small clumps ( compared to the lovell beam , fwhm : @xmath1612@xmath20 ) , that the area over which the clumps are spread out is larger than the size of the lovell beam , and that hijass j1021 + 6842 extends across velocities containing galactic hi emission .",
    "the hi masses of the individual regions are listed in the caption of fig.[mom0 ] .",
    "the channel maps ( fig .  [ mosaic ] ) show that there is a velocity gradient across the hi extent of hijass j1021 + 6842 extending from region i ( near 70 kms@xmath12 ) to region vii ( @xmath1750 kms@xmath12 ) .",
    "the velocities at which the individual regions appear brightest in the channel maps are given in fig .",
    "[ mom0 ] ( right ) .",
    "one interpretation of the velocity gradient is that the emission is gravitationally bound and that the velocity gradient can be interpreted as being due to a ( broken ) annulus in rotation . under this assumption",
    "we find for a radius of 15 kpc and a v@xmath21 of 40 kms@xmath12 a minimum dynamical mass of @xmath22 m@xmath2 .",
    "the resulting ratio of dynamical over detected mass ( or m@xmath23/m@xmath24 ) is @xmath7 10 for the ensemble .",
    "this would be a large ratio which is higher than is typically observed in lower luminosity dwarf irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "we stress however , that a tidal origin may also result in the observed velocity gradient which would imply a significantly lower dynamical mass .",
    "as noted by @xcite , there is no obvious optical counterpart to hijass j1021 + 6842 which is detected on images of the dss .",
    "in addition to this , the m81 group has been the subject of many very thorough searches for small and low surface brightness members ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these searches reached faint surface brightness levels and lead to the discovery of dwarfs as faint as m@xmath25 , corresponding to m@xmath26 at the distance of the m81 group ( thus reaching down to the extreme low  mass end of the luminosity function ) .",
    "as yet , none of these searches have come up with candidate counterparts for hijass j1021 + 6842 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one possible concern is the presence of a bright star in the field ( hd 89343 , ra(2000.0 ) = 10 21 03.3 , dec(2000.0 ) = @xmath1868 44 52 , v = 6 mag . ) which may limit the local sensitivity to low surface brightness optical emission .",
    "it should be noted , though , that the hi distribution is so different from the other m81 group dwarfs that perhaps one would not necessarily expect stars to be associated with this system .",
    "normally , star formation is associated with hi column densities above a certain threshold ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "empirically this threshold hovers around @xmath27 atoms @xmath4 for dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "the fact that no optical counterpart has been found appears to be consistent with this threshold .",
    "clearly , deep optical follow  up",
    "observations are needed to determine at higher confidence whether or not stars are associated with hijass j1021 + 6842 .",
    "another possible explanation for the lack of stars in hijass j1021 + 6842 is the possibility that we are seeing the early stages of formation of a new galaxy .",
    "this could either be formation from a primodial cloud or formation from tidal debris as discussed , e.g. , by @xcite or @xcite ( and references therein ) . given the relatively dense environment of the central m81 triplet , the position of hijass j1021 + 6842 seems to be an unlikely location for the contemporary precipitation of a primordial galaxy .",
    "if hijass j1021 + 6842 is tidal debris ( perhaps from the outer parts of one of the larger galaxies in the m81 group ) , then the small velocity differences between its components allow for the possibility that the entire system is gravitationally bound , which could potentially lead to future concentration and the formation of stars .",
    "since hijass j1021 + 6842 was discovered in a survey of the m81 group , it is natural to assume that it is a member of that group .",
    "nonetheless , hijass j1021 + 6842 is an unusual system and , before assuming group membership , it is important to consider evidence in favor or against this assumption .",
    "an overview of the relative locations of the m81 group members in the plane of the sky is presented in @xcite , their figure  1 .",
    "the systemic velocity of @xmath8 30 kms@xmath12 is certainly consistent with membership in the m81 group @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is only offset from m81 by 2.3  in angle ( corresponding to a minimum distance of @xmath16 140 kpc ) and 40 kms@xmath12 in radial velocity .",
    "in addition , hijass j1021 + 6842 is situated very close to the m81 group member ic2574 both in position ( projected distance : 110kpc ) and velocity ( @xmath28v=30 km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "this may suggest that ic2574 and hijass j1021 + 6842 are companions , a scenario which is tentatively supported by the hijass observations which indicate a low column density hi bridge connecting them .    what is the probability that this object is part of the local group rather than the m81 group ?",
    "in that case hijass j1021 + 6842 would likely be classified as a high velocity cloud ( hvc ) .",
    "there are several problems with such a hypothesis , however .",
    "a strong argument against it is its fairly high column density , of order @xmath29 atoms @xmath4 which is at least an order of magnitude higher than what is found even in the magellanic stream @xcite .",
    "given its angular size , hijass j1021 + 6842 would be classified as a compact hvc .",
    "again , typical column densities for chvcs are at least an order of magnitude lower @xcite . an additional strong argument arguing against hijass j1021 + 6842",
    "being an hvc is that typical hvcs in the direction of m81 have velocities in the range @xmath17150 to @xmath17200 kms@xmath12 @xcite , i.e. at much lower velocities .",
    "we therefore conclude that hijass j1021 + 6842 is indeed associated with the m81 group .",
    "we present vla hi 21 cm observations of hijass j1021 + 6842 discovered by @xcite in the direction of the m81 group .",
    "given its location , column densities and systemic velocity , hijass j1021 + 6842 is very likely a member of the m81 group .",
    "perhaps the most striking result is that the hi emission is distributed over an area of 30kpc in diameter which is much larger than the extent of the largest dwarf members of the m81 group .",
    "this , and the lack of detectable stars makes the hijass j1021 + 6842 system absolutely unique amongst the m81 group members . other hi clouds known to date which have no detected optical counterparts are the sw clump of hi 1225 + 01 @xcite , hipass j0731 - 69 @xcite , and hi clouds in virgo @xcite .",
    "we detect 1.6 @xmath0 10@xmath1 m@xmath2  of hi distributed over roughly 30 kpc in hijass j1021 + 6842 .",
    "peak hi column densities are of order @xmath19 atoms @xmath4 , which is well below the empirical threshold for star formation activity to commence .",
    "this may explain why to date no optical counterpart has been identified .",
    "the individual clouds which make up the system are either self gravitating entities orbiting within their mutual gravitational potential , or the densest concentrations of a huge , 30kpc diameter , gently rotating , very low surface density cloud . assuming that the entire complex is gravitationally bound",
    ", we derive a minimum dynamical mass of @xmath30m@xmath2 , which would be more than an order of magnitude more massive than the luminous ( hi ) mass",
    ". it should be stressed , though , that other scenarios , such as a past stripping event leading to the formation of tidal debris , may also result in the observed velocity structure ( thus leading to a significantly lower dynamical mass of the system ) .",
    "the present observations clearly demonstrate the uniqueness of hijass j1021 + 6842 .",
    "future high sensitivity hi synthesis observations of hijass j1021 + 6842 and its surroundings and deep optical and uv imaging will be necessary to elucidate the true nature of this enigmatic object .",
