    "graphene - like layered materials are extensively studied for their unique mechanical , electronic and chemical properties .",
    "popular among them are the transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) of the type mx2 , where m is a metal and x is chalcogen @xcite .",
    "such materials include mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 which are semiconductors in both their 3d and 2d structure @xcite , while new members are constantly added to this family @xcite .",
    "although semiconducting in 2d , there is strong evidence that mos@xmath0 is metallic in its quasi 1d structures @xcite .",
    "apart from using them as a model system for the structure of edges , mos@xmath0 nanoribbons have been studied extensively as they offer a unique electronic structure that combines features of mos@xmath0 and graphene .",
    "bollinger et al .",
    "@xcite were the first who predicted metallic edge states on mos@xmath0 nanoribbons using dft simulations .",
    "later , such nanoribbons were synthesized by camacho - bragado em et al . attached to moo@xmath2 clusters @xcite and by wang _",
    "inside carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "several theoreticians have simulated such nanoribbons : li _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite predicted that zig - zag mos@xmath0 nanoribbons are magnetic and are more stable than triangular nanoclusters .",
    "@xcite showed that strain and applied electric field can alter dramatically both magnetism and electronic structure . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we had found that the metallic edges alter the dielectric permitivity of the nanoribbons and that their spatial extent is around 5   from the edge of the material .",
    "_ @xcite found that armchair nanoribbons can be stabilized by h adsorption and possess a semiconducting character with strong exciton effects .",
    "finally , mos@xmath0 nanoribbons could have a key role in the hydrogen evolution reaction @xcite , and graphene support enhances these features @xcite .",
    "@xcite verified the tunability of edge states using electric field and hydrogen absorption .",
    "although the presence of metallic states in mos@xmath0 and their electronic structure is well established , two questions remain open : first , what is the stability of such edges in relevant experimental conditions .",
    "the limited number of reports for their synthesis implies that such structures might be unfavorable , while their use in catalysis confirms that , once formed , these structures are extremely stable .",
    "second , it is not clear whether the metallic edges are favorable or not for electrons of holes of the semiconducting bulk . in other words ,",
    "what is the position of fermi level of the metallic region relative to the fermi level of the bulk .    in this work ,",
    "we attempt to provide answers to both these questions .",
    "we start by verifying the presence of metallic edges in mos@xmath0 and other tmds , with different edge terminations .",
    "we calculate the stability of edges using the chemical potential of chalcogens as a free parameter .",
    "finally , we align the band structure and dos of the nanoribbon with that of the two - dimensional single layer and discuss band offsets and changes in the fermi level .",
    "we perform dft calculations using the open - source grid - based projector augmented - wave ( gpaw ) package @xcite .",
    "gpaw employs the paw method @xcite and uses real - space grids for the representation of the wave functions and the electron densities . for the calculation of the exchange - correlation functional we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite .",
    "although pbe functional is not the preferable choice for the calculation of the band structure due to its underestimation of the energy gap @xcite , the use of hybrid functionals and/or many - body equations to treat accurately the excitonic effects @xcite is well beyond the scope of this work where we mostly focus on ground - state properties or trends for the position of the fermi level .    the atomic simulation environment ( ase ) open - source suite @xcite is used for the generation of structures , atomic relaxation and analysis of the results",
    "in gpaw , the computational parameters that need to be taken into account are the grid spacing , @xmath3 , the number of monkhorst - pack @xmath4-points in the brillouin zone and the thickness of the vacuum region beyond the last atoms of the system .",
    "the parameters used in our study are @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath4-points and @xmath7 . for each @xmath4-point",
    "we use 344 eigenstates .",
    "this number of bands corresponds to @xmath8 states for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of valence electrons .",
    "we create tmd nanoribbons of the four most common two - dimensional tmds : mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 . for each material , we start from a rectangular unit cell with sides @xmath11 along @xmath12 and @xmath13 along @xmath14 , where @xmath11 is the theoretical lattice constant of the 2d material .",
    "we use the theoretical lattice parameters for the tmds as found in ref .",
    "the unit cell contains 2 metal and 4 chalcogen atoms .",
    "we construct a supercell by repeating this unit cell @xmath15 times along @xmath14 and then a vacuum region is added along @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed along all axes .",
    "the structure formed is a nanoribbon of infinite length along @xmath12 and has a width of @xmath15 cells along @xmath14 , with ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this corresponds to nanoribbon widths in the range of 3.5   to 42.4 .    for every width , @xmath15",
    ", we consider five different terminations of the m - edge .",
    "these terminations correspond to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) x adatoms decorating the m - edge ( see fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ) . in total",
    ", we consider 140 nanoribbons ( four materials times seven widths times five terminations ) .",
    "for each nanoribbon , we allow full relaxation of atom positions in the first two layers from both edges , as well as all adatom positions .    ball - and stick model of relaxed structures of typical nanoribbons ( mose@xmath0 with @xmath9 ) with increasing number of adatoms , from zero ( left ) to four ( right ) , at the metal - terminated zig zag edge .",

    "in fig . [ 6 ] , we present a comparison of the density of states of the mx@xmath0 nanoribbons with the respective 2d materials . we observe similar features in all calculations .",
