    "the halos of galaxies provide us with a fossil record of the earliest processes of galaxy formation .",
    "however , studying the halo content is particularly difficult in disk and spiral galaxies , where the halos are sparsely populated when compared to their disk subsystems",
    ". therefore observations of halos in disk galaxies require either extremely deep surface photometry studies ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or photometric and kinematic studies of the individual stars , star clusters , or planetary nebulae that populate these halos . only in the nearest galaxies can the latter method(s ) be employed .",
    "the halo of the spiral galaxy m31 provides us with a uniquely large , nearby , and readily accessible population of halo stars in a giant disk galaxy .",
    "it is near enough that photometry of its brightest red - giant branch ( rgb ) stars is easily carried out with 4-meter - class telescopes . since the pioneering color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of m31 s halo stars by @xcite , a large number of cmd - based studies",
    "have been carried out from the ground @xcite and using the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "these studies consistently show that the majority of m31 halo stars are redder than their mw counterparts , a difference usually attributed to higher metallicity .",
    "these studies ( most of which are based on fields located at projected distances from @xmath5 to over 20 kpc from m31 , and most lying near the se minor axis of m31 ) find the mean metallicity for the m31 halo stars to be in the range @xmath6 [ fe / h ] @xmath7 , showing remarkable consistency for datasets differing greatly in photometric depth , field size , and observed colors . whether or not the mean halo [ fe / h ] varies with radius is unclear ,",
    "although @xcite suggested that a strong metallicity gradient does _ not _ exist in the inner halo , and recent studies in more remote fields suggest that this is indeed the case @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these studies show that the m31 halo stars cover a wide range of metallicity ( @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath9 ) , a conclusion further confirmed by spectroscopic studies @xcite . for comparison , the mw halo is more metal - poor by nearly an order of magnitude in the mean ( [ fe / h]@xmath10 ; ryan & norris 1991 ) .",
    "in addition to the differences in the metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) , the spatial density of halo stars in the mw follows a power law @xcite , which differs from the @xmath4 profile of the m31 bulge / halo found by @xcite , more like that of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "interestingly , the mdf of the m31 halo shows remarkable similarities with that of the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 and the compact elliptical m32 @xcite ; the high mean metallicity of the latter @xcite has led to the suggestion that perhaps tidal disruption of m32 ( eg .",
    "* ) has helped create the largely metal - rich m31 halo @xcite .",
    "there are a number of other scenarios envisioned for matching current observational results of the m31 halo , including a massive merger @xcite , formation via accretion of smaller , stellar fragments @xcite , and in situ star formation from the agglomeration of smaller , primarily gas - rich objects @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been exciting new revelations on the structure of the m31 halo .",
    "@xcite have reported the detection of a large stream of metal - rich stars se of m31 in their wide - field survey , and @xcite showed that there is more complex substructure in the halo and outer disk regions of m31 . @xcite and @xcite have also found evidence for additional tidally disrupted satellite galaxies in the m31 halo . in an observational _ tour de force _",
    ", @xcite have created an extremely deep hst - based cmd of the m31 halo about 11 kpc from the nucleus , and have confirmed the basic results of previous work ( largely metal - rich halo , fewer metal - poor stars ) .",
    "however , they also deduce that the metal - rich stars may be a few gyr younger than that of the ( old ) metal - poor stars and suggest that this age difference originates from a major merger 6 - 10 gyr ago ( the metal - rich population requiring incorporation of a rather massive galaxy ) .",
    "these are all interesting possibilities that require further study , and indicate that the m31 halo is not simply a homogeneous , coeval population of metal - rich stars .",
    "in our first paper ( durrell et al 2001 ; hereafter paper i ) , we described @xmath11 photometry for over 2000 rgb halo stars in a halo field located about 20 kpc from m31 along the southeast minor axis .",
    "we found that the mdf at this projected location is , like the inner halo , still strongly weighted towards more metal - rich stars with a major peak in the mdf at [ fe / h]@xmath12 .",
    "the mdf also has a well populated tail extending to lower metallicities , making the entire distribution extremely broad . , where [ fe / h ] @xmath13 [ m / h ] @xmath14 0.3 [ assuming an enhanced [ o / fe]=@xmath15 . ] in the discussion of paper i we suggested that the entire halo mdf could be matched by a classic `` simple model '' of chemical evolution with wind - driven mass loss , and could be explained by a formation scenario where much of the m31 halo formed though the accretion of primarily gas - rich fragments .    in the present paper ,",
    "we describe new results for a field located @xmath16 kpc from m31 also along the se minor axis , and create the first clearly defined halo kpc from m31 s nucleus , but it is clear this area is contaminated by disk stars , and may also have tidal streams / features ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this field does not represent a ` clean ' halo field at @xmath17 kpc . ]",
    "mdf at such a large distance from m31 .",
    "the observations we present here are of a single field centered at @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the field referred to as @xmath20 by @xcite .",
    "we used the uh8k camera at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on sept .",
    "19 , 1996 to acquire the data , during the same observing run from which our paper i observations were obtained .",
    "the uh8k camera ( now decommissioned ) was an 8-ccd mosaic camera with a total imaging area of 8192@xmath21 pixels or 28@xmath221 @xmath23 28@xmath221 ( scale = 0@xmath24206 per pixel ) .",
    "one of the chips ( chip 4 ) showed considerable bleeding and other inherent structure , and the low qe of chip 6 also proved to make it of little use for our purposes .",
    "we have thus used the remaining 6 chips ( covering an area of 21@xmath25 x 28@xmath25 on the sky ) for all subsequent analysis .",
    "the center of our field is located 2@xmath262 se of the m31 nucleus along the minor axis , or at a projected distance of @xmath16 kpc from m31 , assuming @xmath27 kpc for m31 @xcite ; the entire field samples stars located from 1@xmath2690 to 2@xmath265 ( 27 to 35 kpc ) from m31 .",
    "the location of the @xmath20 field is plotted in figure 1 , which also illustrates the fields from other recent m31 halo studies ( including our @xmath28 [ 20 kpc ] field from paper i ) .",
    "our field @xmath20 is located just within the outer extent of the m31 halo survey of @xcite .",
    "our science images of the @xmath20 field were obtained under non - photometric conditions , although shorter exposure images of the field were taken on the ( photometric ) night of sept .",
    "21 , 1996 during the same observing run which we could use to calibrate our data .",
    "the photometry was calibrated through @xcite standards observed during the entire observing run ( sept 19 - 23 , 1996 ) .",
    "the calibration equations were derived for stars on a single chip ( chip 1 ) of the uh8k mosaic , and zeropoint shifts ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) were derived to make the appropriate corrections to the @xmath31 and @xmath32 magnitudes measured on the other chips ( a detailed description can be found in paper i ) :    @xmath33    @xmath34    here @xmath35 is the mean airmass ( the airmass terms are adopted values from landolt 1992 ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the zeropoint values derived for chip 1 , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the instrumental aperture magnitudes for chip @xmath40 , as measured through an aperture radius of 3.3@xmath41 and normalized to an exposure time of 1 second .",
    "the rms scatter of the standard stars in each of the calibration equations was 0.018  0.027 magnitudes .",
    "as with the previous data presented in paper i ( the inner @xmath28 field and a very remote background field @xmath42 ) , the exposure times were 4 @xmath23 900s in @xmath31 and 3 @xmath23 900s in @xmath32 , with seeing on most individual images of @xmath130@xmath248 to 1@xmath240 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the program images were pre - processed with bias frames , dark frames and flat - fields , and then combined in the normal manner through iraf tools .",
    "flat fielding was carried out on the individual chips , using either a combined ` superflat ' or a twilight flat that had been further corrected using a heavily smoothed superflat .",
    "the resulting images had uniform background intensities to less than @xmath43 .",
    "the individual ccd images were re - registered , scaled and averaged to construct a single combined image for each chip in each filter .",
    "the fwhm of the stellar images in all of the final , combined images was @xmath13 0@xmath2490 for the @xmath31 images , and @xmath130@xmath2495 for the @xmath32 images .",
    "photometry of the objects on each combined image was performed with the stand - alone versions of the daophot ii / allstar packages @xcite .",
    "a single pass of daophot ii @xmath44 allstar with a 3.5@xmath45 detection threshold was adopted , since tests showed that a second pass of daophot ii did not add noticeably to the number of objects detected on these relatively uncrowded fields . a stellar point - spread - function ( psf )",
    "was derived from 17 to 32 bright , uncrowded stars per image .",
    "a constant psf was found to adequately fit the data on all images .",
    "we are only interested in objects on the images with stellar appearance , so any resolved background galaxies that were not already ignored by daophot ii were subsequently removed with a combination of image parameters : the daophot @xmath46 parameter @xcite , and the @xmath47 image moment from @xcite and @xcite ( the difference between the psf and aperture magnitudes ) , because it eliminated few objects that were not already rejected through either daophot @xmath46 or @xmath47 . ] .",
    "all objects exceeding _ either _ @xmath48 or @xmath49 were considered to be non - stellar and rejected from further analysis .",
    "we used artificial - star experiments ( see below ) to set the classification boundaries and to confirm that few genuinely stellar objects were rejected .",
    "the separate @xmath31 and @xmath32 lists of stellar objects from each chip were merged with a matching radius of 1 pixel , and then used to create @xmath50 color - magnitude diagrams for each .",
    "the cmd of the entire @xmath20 field ( all 6 ccds ) is plotted in figure 2 , along with the background field @xmath42 for comparison .",
    "we note that the cmds from the individual mosaic chips have slightly different photometric completeness limits ( see next section ) due to small qe differences , and we show the extreme values for these limits in figure 2 .",
    "typical errorbars ( derived from the artificial star experiments ; see below ) for stars with @xmath51 are also plotted .",
    "there are a total of 6292 starlike objects in the @xmath20 cmd , roughly @xmath52 more than present in the background @xmath42 field ( 4648 stars ; paper i ) .",
    "over the nearly 550 arcmin@xmath21 in each field , the density of stars is thus quite uncrowded in an absolute sense .",
    "the usable field size of the @xmath20 field is 546 arcmin@xmath21 , almost exactly the same size as the background field , so roughly one - third of the stars in our outer - halo field should be m31 halo stars .",
    "most of the brighter ( @xmath53 ) objects are foreground milky way halo stars , and most of the fainter , bluer objects are unresolved background galaxies .",
    "we have performed a series of tests to confirm that we are indeed detecting the m31 halo this far from the galaxy center .",
    "first , we define a box within the cmd ( @xmath54 ) within which we expect the upper part of the m31 rgb to be present , and simply count the numbers of stars in each of our program fields that lie within that box . for @xmath42",
    ", there are 1034 such stars ( assumed to be entirely background contamination ) ; for @xmath20 , there are 1603 stars ; and for @xmath28  our field from paper i  there are 3312 stars .",
    "since this part of the cmd is bright enough and blue enough that all three fields should have similar photometric limits and high completeness , we can use these totals to make _ rough _ estimates of the statistical significance of the rgb detection . from the count statistics ( and for the moment ignoring slight differences in the foreground reddening of each field ; see below ) , we then estimate that we detect @xmath55 upper - rgb stars in field @xmath20 , and @xmath56 in the mid - halo field @xmath28 .",
    "this test is suggestive that we are detecting the rgb at high significance , even though the background contamination is @xmath57 larger than the rgb `` signal '' in @xmath20 .",
    "a more rigorous version of the field subtraction is done below .",
    "a slightly more advanced test is to ask whether this excess residual population follows the luminosity function ( lf ) that would be expected for a true rgb .",
    "we have constructed a smoothed lf of the residual population @xmath58 in the same way as we did in paper i. the result is shown in figure 3 .",
    "here we use a smoothing kernel of 0.03 mag , and to remove some of the most obvious background contamination brighter than the rgb tip , we exclude stars with @xmath59 bluer than @xmath60 or redder than @xmath61 ( again , the same procedure we used for field @xmath62 . the residual lf is noisier than we found in paper i , but there is a clear excess of stellar objects fainter than @xmath63 with numbers rising towards fainter magnitudes in just the same way as we found in paper i ( see for comparison fig.6 in that paper ) . _",
    "brighter _ than this level , the background population subtracts cleanly away with no significant residuals .",
    "the @xmath20 field passes the lf consistency test .    as a third test",
    ", we have also performed a one - by - one statistical subtraction of background stars from the @xmath20 cmd . to do this ,",
    "we take each star in the @xmath20 cmd list and calculate the `` separation radius '' @xmath64 to every star in the @xmath42 list as @xmath65)^2 + ( ( v - i)_{r1 } - ( v - i)_{m3})^2}$ ] . if any star in @xmath42 has @xmath66 mag , then both it and its matching object in @xmath20 are flagged and removed from the lists . in this way we match up stars within a fairly narrow range in color but a more generous range in magnitude ( the distance , i.e.  apparent magnitude , of the background star is less important for this purpose than its color , i.e.  population type ) .",
    "this process is continued until every star in @xmath20 has been tried .    in figure 4",
    "we show , first , the cmd for the remaining _ unmatched _ @xmath20 stars , and second , the cmd of all the _ matched _ @xmath20 stars .",
    "by hypothesis , the first of these two cmds should be a nearly pure rgb population from the m31 halo , while the second cmd should be a nearly pure background population ( and should resemble the original cmd of the @xmath42 field , from fig .  2 ) .",
    "4a , an rgb stands out clearly in the expected region of the cmd , while other areas have almost entirely subtracted away .",
    "while this residual `` signal '' is much smaller than the population we found in the @xmath28 ( 20 kpc ) field , features of the m31 halo rgb are still clear , such as the blue ` edge ' of stars at @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which are the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath69 ) m31 halo stars .",
    "this statistically cleaned cmd does not take into account slight place - to - place differences in limiting magnitude or photometric completeness , and so we do not use it to do any direct analyses of the metallicity distribution or number counts . however , we regard it as a very strong test of the genuine presence of the m31 halo in our outer field .",
    "the photometric completeness @xmath70 of a star in the cmd is a function of @xmath32 , @xmath71 , and also location within the ccd mosaic because of chip - to - chip differences in qe within the array . here",
    ", @xmath70 is defined as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the total number of stars added to the science images with a particular value of @xmath1 , and @xmath74 is the total number of those stars that are recovered , regardless of where they were found on the cmd .    to trace the completeness function behavior , we performed a series of artificial - star experiments on each chip .",
    "these tests are the same as those carried out in paper i for other fields in our survey .",
    "a total of 40000 stars ( 10 runs of 4000 total stars added per run ) were added to the _ star - subtracted _ science images for each chip .",
    "the stars had discrete input magnitudes and colors sampled at 0.5 magnitude intervals in the grid ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) .",
    "the simulated images were then reduced in precisely the same way as described above  a single pass of daophot ii / allstar , merging of the resulting @xmath31 and @xmath32 datasets , and removal of non - stellar images using the image - classification algorithm .",
    "the number of stars added was similar to those found on the original science frames , indicating that we have adequately re - created the rather low crowding conditions on the frames .",
    "the limiting magnitudes ( @xmath77 ; defined as the 50% completeness level ) for each individual chip were derived by fitting the interpolation function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is a parameter that measures the rate of decline of @xmath80 at @xmath77 .",
    "the values for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for each chip are listed in table 1 .",
    "our results can be compared directly to those obtained in paper i for the other fields in our survey ; the limits of our @xmath20 data are comparable to that of the background @xmath42 field , but different from the interior @xmath28 field ( the @xmath20 limits are @xmath83 mag brighter in @xmath32 , and @xmath83 deeper in @xmath31 ) .",
    "these differences are due to the sky conditions ; our @xmath28 data had better overall seeing ( 0@xmath247 vs. 0@xmath249 ) , but much brighter sky conditions for the @xmath31 images .",
    "each star observed in our cmd ( figure 2 ) was then assigned a value of @xmath84 based on linear interpolation between the grid points from the artificial star results from the chip the star was measured on ; it is these values that are used to derived corrected number counts for our mdf analyses below .      in paper",
    "i , the appropriate total reddening @xmath85 for the @xmath42 and @xmath28 fields was directly determined from the location of the blue edge of the foreground milky way halo population in the cmds . in figure 5",
    "we have matched the color histogram of all stars with @xmath86 ( all , presumably , foreground milky way halo stars ) in the @xmath20 cmd with the derived blue edge of the @xmath28 field at @xmath87 .",
    "to match the histograms , we need to shift the @xmath20 data 0.03 mag to the red , suggesting @xmath88 for this field ( where we have assumed an error of 0.02 mag on the color difference ) .",
    "this observed difference is due to the ( slightly ) higher galactic latitude of the @xmath20 field , but is also affected by the uncertainties ( @xmath89 mag ) in the photometric color zeropoint ; the latter is likely the dominant factor .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the predicted value ( @xmath90 ) we find from the maps of @xcite .",
    "in addition , by adopting this empirical approach to deriving @xmath85 for a given field , we effectively remove any systematic errors resulting from field - to - field color calibration differences .",
    "in order to construct a metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) from our cmd , we need to assume an age distribution for the halo stars . to do so",
    ", we have assumed that all the halo stars are comparably old , so that by hypothesis the locations of the rgb loci are determined primarily by metallicity .",
    "while this may seem at odds with the finding of a intermediate - age m31 halo population by @xcite , we note that this result ( derived for a field located @xmath91 kpc from m31 ) may not be applicable to our much more remote halo fields .",
    "more importantly , the locus of the intrinsic rgb is insensitive to age for stellar populations that are already old , and thus any large spread in rgb location is most likely to be due to metallicity differences . in a more practical direction ,",
    "since our data do not reach the fainter but more age - sensitive regions of the cmd ( the horizontal branch and main - sequence turnoff ) , they _ can not _ be used to investigate the age distribution of the m31 halo without _ a priori _ knowledge of the stellar metallicities that the rgb gives us to first order . here , we simply assume the same age distribution ( effectively , the same set of fiducial rgb tracks ) as used in paper i so that we can make the most direct possible comparison between the two fields .",
    "clearly , in future it would be of great interest to find out if the inner - halo age spread found by @xcite persists into the outer halo , but even an age range of @xmath92 gyr would not strongly affect the mdf deduced from the rgb ; for a star of a given @xmath71 color , changing the age from 12 to 5 gyr would increase the derived metallicity by @xmath93 dex ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    in practice",
    ", we use stars in the brightest two magnitudes of the rgb and a grid of fiducial rgb model tracks to estimate the abundance [ m / h ] of each star ( defined as [ m / h ] = log(@xmath94 ) , where we adopt @xmath95 as in harris & harris 2000 and paper i ) . for consistency with previous work",
    ", we use the evolutionary tracks for 0.8@xmath96 red giants by @xcite , calibrated to @xmath71 colors and normalized to standard milky way globular cluster fiducial sequences as discussed in more detail by @xcite . to extend the @xcite grid to the most metal - rich stars ( [ m / h ] @xmath97 ) we use empirical tracks from two metal - rich star clusters ( ngc 6553 , 6791 ) as discussed in @xcite .    in figure 6",
    "we have re - plotted the @xmath20 cmd , overlaid with the model evolutionary tracks .",
    "the model grid was shifted by the m31 distance moduli ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) and reddenings ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) for the @xmath42 and @xmath20 fields , respectively ( see fig",
    ".  8 of paper i for the cmd of the background @xmath42 with superimposed tracks .",
    "the excess population of rgb stars in the @xmath20 field at intermediate colors and fainter than @xmath102 is evident ; eg . figure 2 ) .    for each star in the @xmath42 and @xmath20 cmds fainter than the rgb tip ( @xmath103 ) we first derive @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and",
    "then interpolate within the model grid in the ( @xmath106 ) plane to estimate the heavy - element abundance @xmath107 ( and [ m / h ] ) . then , to construct the mdf , we use all stars in the range @xmath108 is slightly brighter than that adopted for the @xmath28 field in paper i because of the limiting - magnitude differences discussed above . ] to minimize the effects of photometric spread in the @xmath32 band and the rather large contribution of blue objects ( likely faint , unresolved galaxies ) fainter than @xmath109 .",
    "finally , the incompleteness - corrected number of stars @xmath110 ( where @xmath111 was derived for 0.1-dex metallicity bins , and the cleaned mdf of our field was constructed by simply subtracting the background mdf of @xmath42 from the raw @xmath20 mdf .",
    "this final mdf is plotted in figure 7 and listed in the first 2 columns of table 2 .",
    "the quoted uncertainties in each metallicity bin are the poisson errors in the background - subtracted totals ( @xmath112 ) . in fig .  7 , we also plot representative errorbars in the derived metallicities that would be generated solely by measurement uncertainties in @xmath71 .",
    "at the blue ( extreme metal - poor ) end of the distribution , the rgb tracks change very little with metallicity , and even small color errors unavoidably translate to a large spread in metal abundance .",
    "nominally , the deeper @xmath31 limit of the 30 kpc field ( compared to that of the 20 kpc field ) should allow us to quantify our mdf to slightly higher metallicities , since it is the @xmath31 band that determines the mdf limit for the extremely red stars with solar metallicities and above .",
    "however , there appear to be very few such stars in the sample in any case ( see also the hst studies by * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their small numbers are additionally uncertain because of the background contamination .",
    "we thus restrict our mdf to sub - solar metallicities .",
    "inspection of figure 7 shows that the m31 outer - halo stars span a wide range in metal abundance ( @xmath113[m / h]@xmath114 ) .",
    "the mdf as a whole is predominantly metal - rich ( peaking around [ m / h]@xmath2 ) but has a significant metal - poor tail ( perhaps with a secondary peak at [ m / h]@xmath115 ) .",
    "median _ metallicity of the entire mdf is [ m / h]@xmath116 or [ fe / h]@xmath117 .",
    "all these features are closely similar to those from the 20 kpc field of paper i.    since the publication of paper i , the fiducial sequences for the metal - rich end of the distribution have been refined somewhat @xcite , and we have also made minor changes to our bilinear interpolation routines .",
    "accordingly , to make the two mdfs as strictly comparable as possible , we have re - created the @xmath28 mdf using the new interpolation routine and exactly the same range in @xmath104 as used above for the @xmath20 field .",
    "this revised mdf is listed in table 2 and plotted in figure 8 , along with the original mdf from paper i. as expected , the mdf is virtually identical ( after allowing for a different number of stars as a result of the more conservative magnitude range adopted here ) , showing that the modifications have no significant effect on the discussion from paper i.    we show our final direct comparison between the 20 kpc and 30 kpc fields in figure 9 . here , the number of @xmath28 stars has been multiplied by a factor of 0.23 to normalize both fields to the same effective population .",
    "it is evident that little difference exists between the two mdfs .",
    "a formal @xmath118 test over the range @xmath119 [ m / h ] @xmath120 indicates that they are similar at the 27% confidence level .",
    "in fact , any formal statistical difference is almost entirely due to the relative excess of stars in only 2 of the 21 bins ( each of which in turn is based on a very small number of stars ) .",
    "for all the other bins , the error bars of the two mdfs mutually overlap .      a by - product of our mdf comparison is a limited investigation of the radial profile of the outer m31 halo .",
    "* hereafter pvdb94 ) combined measurements from various sources to construct the surface brightness profile of the m31 halo , finding that the profile could be fit by an r@xmath121 law from 0.2 to 20 kpc .",
    "the outer halo alone could be approximated by a steep power law ( stellar volume density @xmath122 to r@xmath123 ) .",
    "as we have not independently derived the absolute values of @xmath124 from our data ( such an analysis is beyond the scope of this paper ) , we limit ourselves to a deriving the relative number densities for the @xmath28 and @xmath20 fields .",
    "the magnitude range for the stars in both mdfs is similar , so the normalization of the mdfs should directly yield the relative number density .",
    "the total background - corrected number counts in each mdf ( up to [ m / h]@xmath125 ) in table 2 are @xmath126 and @xmath127 , making the number ratio @xmath128 . converted to a surface brightness ratio",
    ", this means the @xmath20 field is @xmath129 magnitudes fainter than @xmath28 .",
    "if we adopt the ( admittedly uncertain ) surface brightness of @xmath130 for the 20 kpc field from pvdb94 , this suggests the observed surface brightness of our 30 kpc field is @xmath131 .",
    "this shows the advantage ( and in fact , the necessity ) of using a large field size to detect extremely low surface brightness through direct starcounts ; in the small fields used by pvdb94 , the m31 halo rgb was barely detected in the @xmath28 field , and only an upper limit for @xmath20 could be derived ( @xmath132 , consistent with our new result ) .",
    "assuming the @xmath4 law profile from pvdb94 and a minor axis effective radius @xmath133 of 1.4 kpc ( we have scaled the @xmath134 kpc value from pvdb94 for a distance of 780 kpc ) , we predict @xmath135 in the range 4.7 to 5.6 ( assuming an error of @xmath136 in @xmath133 and an error of @xmath137 kpc in the centers of the @xmath138 kpc and @xmath139 kpc bins ) .",
    "thus the stellar density in the @xmath20 field is _ consistent with the m31 spheroid continuing as an @xmath4 profile out to at least @xmath139",
    "kpc_.    similarly , we can derive the stellar surface density decrease from @xmath138 kpc to @xmath139 kpc as a power law , from which we derive @xmath140 , or a volume stellar density @xmath141 ; these numbers are , again , consistent with power law values derived by pvdb94 for @xmath142 kpc .",
    "note , however , that we are unable to discriminate between the two different profiles with our results .",
    "studies of the stellar density of stars in fields at still larger radii will be required to fully address this issue ( e.g. j. ostheimer et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the primary results from our analysis are that    \\(a ) _ the outer halo of m31 is predominantly broad and metal - rich to arbitrarily large galactocentric distances _ , and    \\(b ) _ the outer halo shows little or no radial metallicity gradient_.    in turn , our observed mdfs are ( for the most part ) very similar to those found by other researchers in more interior fields @xcite .",
    "this statement does not contradict the recent findings of significant substructure in the m31 halo @xcite , as many of the halo fields are not located near the stream and warped disk features found in the @xcite survey .",
    "it appears therefore that many of the mdf studies to date have been sampling the ` typical halo ' of m31 .",
    "the contributions of accretion of satellite galaxies do , however , appear to be an important ( although not necessarily the most _ dominant _ ) factor , based on the recent studies of @xcite and @xcite and the presence of a significant `` tail '' of metal - poor stars in the mdfs we measure .",
    "the mdf that we and other authors find for the m31 halo , to very large galactocentric distances , gives no indication that it has a classic milky - way - like metal - poor halo dominating anywhere .",
    "@xcite find that a more metal - rich _ bulge _ population begins clearly within @xmath143 kpc , but at larger radii they see no significant increase in the relative size of the metal - poor population out to @xmath144 kpc .",
    "our work now extends this limit to almost 35 kpc .",
    "the combined data make it plausible to suggest that m31 is surrounded by a predominantly metal - rich , r@xmath121 _ spheroid _ , not unlike the outer parts of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "as noted above , we did not assume the age distribution derived for an inner - halo 11 kpc field by @xcite .",
    "in their study , they find that the metal - poor population is classically `` old '' ( like milky way globular clusters ) , but the more metal - rich population is of intermediate age ( @xmath145 gyr ) . including some version of this age - vs .- metallicity gradient in our analysis",
    "would clearly yield a modified mdf which would be still broader and extend to still higher maximum metallicity , though not in a major way ( slightly lower age would require higher [ m / h ] to yield the same @xmath71 color ) .",
    "deep enough photometry to reach the main sequence turnoff is as yet available for only this one m31 field , and so it is currently unknown if such a younger stellar population is present at the much larger halo distances that we have sampled .",
    "possibilities exist that the @xcite sample may include some contamination from a disk population @xcite , or from another stellar stream @xcite , or something akin to a m31 ` thick - disk ' population @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that the @xcite field is located further from the m31 nucleus than those of some other studies ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which found an mdf from the red giants that is _ very similar _ to that found in our distant fields ( see brown 2003 for a similar discussion ) .",
    "furthermore , none of these mdfs show the additional very red population observed by @xcite which clearly could be sampling a thick disk ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite has shown that even a warped m31 disk can not explain the large fraction of intermediate - age stars in their study .",
    "the kinematics of these stellar populations in the outer environs of m31 will be of extreme importance in finally determining their true nature .",
    "if the flattened m31 ` halo ' ( clearly shown in the maps of @xcite and @xcite ) _ is _ rotation - dominated , it would not be like any thick disk currently known .",
    "@xcite have performed a kinematical study of the planetary nebulae in the outer regions of m31 , and clearly show that the outer parts of the m31 bulge ( the same region that we have called ` halo ' in this paper ) are indeed rotating .",
    "this is suggestive of either a dominant ` bulge ' population ( if a kinematically distinct [ more metal - poor ? ] population does exist ) , or at the very least a rotating metal - rich ` spheroid ' ( but not a ` thick - disk ' ) population .",
    "in addition to this , the outer halos of some giant ellipticals have significant rotation signatures @xcite .",
    "for all of the differences between the m31 and milky way halos emphasized above , the milky way may also have a somewhat flattened outer stellar halo ( eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "we found in paper i that the observed mdf of our 20-kpc field could be well matched by a single - zone simple chemical evolution model with a numerical ` yield ' @xmath146 .",
    "though this effective nucleosynthetic yield is more than 5 times larger than the best - fit value for the milky way halo , it is still low enough to suggest that almost half the original gas in the region was ejected or unused in the rounds of star formation which formed these stars . by inference , we can make the same suggestion about the 30 kpc field mdf since it is virtually identical . whether the ` proto - m31 ' region was created from many dwarf - sized fragments coming together , or the merging of a few larger , more massive gaseous protogalaxies can not be told from these simple chemical models .    other mechanisms to form metal - rich spheroid populations",
    "have also been explored . in the dissipationless - accretion model of @xcite ,",
    "the mdf of the halo is generated from multiple accretions of satellites which have already formed most of their stars , although the mass spectrum of such satellite dwarf galaxies would be required to be strongly weighted towards the high - mass end if the mdf is as metal - rich as we see in m31 and in large ellipticals @xcite .",
    "by contrast , @xcite use cdm - based hierarchical merging models of gaseous fragments to construct mdfs that are typically broad and metal - rich , closely resembling what we see in m31 or ( e.g. ) ngc 5128 . in this model",
    ", the sequence of mergers typically continues for a few gyr and so the metal - richer population can easily be younger by a few gyr than the first , metal - poor population .",
    "lastly , @xcite explored the possibility that the merger of two disk galaxies could explain the ngc 5128 halo mdf , and further suggested that the m31 halo could have formed via a similar route . in this latter model , the stars now in the halo originated in the moderately metal - rich progenitor disks before the merger .",
    "an advantage of this disk - merger model is that is can easily explain the fact that the mdf of the _ globular clusters _ in the merged galaxy is different from the halo - star mdf ( the metal - poor clusters were the ones already present in the progenitor galaxies , while most of the metal - richer ones formed in the merger ) .",
    "on the other hand , its disadvantages are that it predicts a modest halo metallicity gradient ( which we do not see in m31 ) , and it does not yet address the necessary later `` reconstruction '' of a major disk in m31 .    in summary , at present",
    "there are a variety of possible modelling approaches capable of generating the rather metal - rich halo mdfs that are now realized to be common in large galaxies .",
    "however , the strong similarities of the halo mdfs to date , the presence of metallicity gradients in the inner spheroids , the small metal - poor population at any radius , and the spheroid luminosity - metallicity correlation @xcite all suggest that stellar satellite accretion is not the _ dominant _ factor in spheroid formation for many galaxies .",
    "we have presented @xmath1 photometry of the m31 halo within a field located 30 kpc from the galaxy center along the se minor axis . using careful object classification and statistical removal of background contamination ,",
    "we have been able to isolate a sample of a few hundred m31 halo red giants .",
    "we derive the photometric metallicity distribution function for this outer m31 halo , and find that it is virtually identical with the mdf from our previously studied 20-kpc field : the implication is that the mdf throughout the halo is broad , moderately metal - rich ( peaking at [ m / h ] @xmath147 ) , and has no systematic radial gradient .",
    "we also find that the m31 halo has a steep radial density profile : the elliptical - like @xmath4 profile determined previously from data at at smaller radii continues on outward through our 30-kpc field .    the authors would like to thank denise hurley - keller , pat ct , steve majewski , mike rich , jamie ostheimer and raja guhathakurta for numerous related discussions , and david bohlender for assistance with the uh8k archival data .",
