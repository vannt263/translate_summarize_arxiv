    "almost two decades ago it was shown that the generalized leading logarithmic approximation in the regge limit of qcd can be described by a spin chain @xcite , which was later shown in @xcite to be completely integrable , i.e. have an infinite tower of conserved charges allowing an analytic diagonalization of its hamiltonian .",
    "the spin chain is defined by a nearest - neighbor interaction given by the bfkl hamiltonian , which has been known since the 70 s as the kernel of the bfkl equation @xcite , giving the leading logarithmic approximation to scattering with color singlet exchange .    from the viewpoint of qcd",
    "it is surprising that such an infinite amount of symmetry is found in the regge limit .",
    "the simplest explanation probably lies in that the regge limit of qcd coincides to lla with the regge limit of the maximally supersymmetric extension of pure yang - mills , @xmath0 super yang mills , for which there is a large amount of evidence that it is integrable ( in the large @xmath1 limit ) to all orders in the gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "having an exact solution of @xmath0 sym will induce a solution in the regge limit , which would explain its integrability . to date , however , there is little understanding of how the integrable structure of @xmath0 implies the symmetries of bfkl and its extensions .",
    "part of the difficulty in making the connection lies in that the symmetries in the regge limit are naturally understood in terms of a two dimensional effective theory ( see for example @xcite ) , in which the longitudinal components of the momenta have decoupled and the dynamics of the theory have been reduced to the transverse plane .",
    "an essential component of the symmetry found in this limit is given by the two - dimensional conformal @xmath2 symmetry discovered by lipatov @xcite .",
    "the running of the coupling constant does not enter the lla , and one can thus suspect that this symmetry is a consequence of the classical conformal symmetry of the qcd lagrangian . when effects from the running of the coupling are included at nlla , the symmetry is broken . in @xmath0 sym ,",
    "by contrast , the coupling does not run , and recent work indeed seems to indicate that the @xmath2 symmetry remains exact at nlla @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems natural to understand the @xmath2 as what remains of the four - dimensional conformal symmetry of @xmath0 when taking the regge limit .",
    "the infinite yangian algebra @xcite of conserved charges of @xmath0 is generated by two copies of the superconformal group @xmath3 @xcite , the first being the ordinary superconformal symmetry of the lagrangian , while the second is a novel , non - lagrangian symmetry , coined dual superconformal symmetry @xcite . if it were possible , in the same way",
    "that the ordinary conformal symmetry would seem to imply the ordinary @xmath2 , to identify a non - trivial remnant of the dual conformal symmetry in the regge limit , one could quite possibly explain the integrability of the generalized lla as being generated by the ordinary @xmath2 and this new dual symmetry .",
    "of this article , used in @xcite to find the spectrum of an integrable , open spin chain in the octet channel . ]    in @xcite we took a step in this direction , identifying a dual @xmath2 symmetry of bfkl .",
    "however , as discussed in that article , the most straightforward application of the dual @xmath2 turns out to be broken by ir effects , which produce anomalous terms when iterating the bfkl equation . in this article",
    ", we discuss whether it is possible that such terms can be reabsorbed into a deformation of the symmetry .",
    "this would parallel the way that the dual conformal symmetry of @xmath0 is made exact by correcting for ir anomalies @xcite .",
    "we also initiate a study of the algebra that is obtained by commuting the ordinary and dual @xmath2 symmetries , extracting a piece of the dual symmetry which is close to a bi - local form frequently appearing in yangian algebras .",
    "although not entirely surprising , the serre relations , which define a yangian algebra , are however not satisfied .",
    "in this section we will motivate the definition of the dual @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "since we are looking for what is left in the regge limit of the dual conformal symmetry of @xmath0 scattering amplitudes , let us first recall how this four - dimensional symmetry is constructed .",
    "if one introduces a set of variables @xmath4 , related to the external ( all taken as incoming ) particle momenta @xmath5 , @xmath6 , through p_i = x_i - x_i+1x_i i+1  , [ eq : xi ] the amplitudes exhibit , at tree level , covariance under a superconformal group acting on the @xmath7 variables in the same way as the ordinary superconformal symmetry acts on spatial coordinates @xcite .",
    "loop integrals are then found to be formally ( before ir regularization ) invariant under the same symmetry . as an example , which will help motivate our version of the symmetry in the regge limit , let us look at the one - loop correction to the four - particle amplitude . in @xmath0 sym",
    "it is simply proportional to the scalar box diagram @xcite , shown in figure [ fig : scalarbox ] .",
    "super yang mills , in terms of incoming momenta @xmath5 , and an integral over the loop momentum @xmath8 . ]    the integral which one obtains when evaluating this diagram is  , which becomes , after introducing @xmath7-variables , and defining a new integration variable @xmath9 through @xmath10 ,  .",
    "[ eq : xint ] if the external particles are on - shell , with @xmath11 , this integral diverges , but ignoring this for the moment one has a formal conformal symmetry acting on the @xmath7 .",
    "this is easily seen by noting that under conformal inversions @xmath12 implying that the squared differences @xmath13 , and the measure @xmath14 transform as x ^2_ij  , d^4x_i  , [ eq : diffandmeasure ] respectively .",
    "let us now make contact with the regge limit . in",
    "non - abelian gauge theories the gluon reggeizes , meaning that when the quantum numbers of the external states so permit , the amplitudes can be described in terms of effective particles propagating in the @xmath15-channel called reggeized gluons , which carry the quantum numbers of ordinary gluons , but for which the propagators ( in feynman gauge ) have been replaced as ( ) ^(t )  , [ eq : reggeprop ] where @xmath16 is called the gluon regge trajectory , and the scale @xmath17 is of order @xmath15 but whose value does otherwise not matter at lla . to leading order ,",
    "the gluon trajectory reads ( ^2 ) = -d^2  , [ eq : trajectoryreggegluon ] where @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the gauge theory coupling and @xmath1 the number of colors .",
    "the form of the trajectory reflects , as mentioned in the introduction , that the dynamics are reduced to the two - dimensional transverse plane in the regge limit , so that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the transverse part of the momentum exchanged in the scattering process .",
    "the substitution incorporates an all - loop resummation , but knowing that the gluon reggeizes it is enough to perform a one - loop computation to calculate the trajectory . expanding in the coupling ,",
    "it is clear that the one - loop amplitude for gluon quantum number exchange should in the regge limit be given by the tree amplitude multiplied by @xmath22 .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to perform this calculation and obtain , as reviewed nicely in @xcite , is to use unitarity , the cutkosky rules and dispersion relations , to obtain the 1-loop amplitude as a product of two tree amplitudes .",
    "this corresponds to setting the upper and lower propagators of figure [ fig : scalarbox ] on - shell .",
    "doing so removes the propagators @xmath23 and @xmath24 from the denominator of and introduces two delta functions , thereby reducing the dimensions of the integral from four to two .",
    "furthermore , in the regge limit , the integral is dominated by the transverse components of the momenta , replacing the @xmath7 by two - dimensional vectors @xmath25 . taking into consideration the tree - level factors ( which corrects numerator of ) one then obtains the reggeized gluon trajectory as ( ^2_24)=-d^2 _ i  .",
    "[ eq : trajectoryreggegluonk1x ]    the same representation of the trajectory would have been obtained by shifting the integration variable @xmath26 of as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is again taken as the new integration variable , and performing the replacement @xmath29 .",
    "this last replacement is precisely what one would obtain from a two - dimensional version of .",
    "furthermore , the integral representation has a formal ( ignoring ir divergences ) two - dimensional inversion symmetry _",
    "i  [ eq : xinversion ] since the squared differences @xmath30 and the measure transforms , similarly to , as ^2_ij  , d^2_i  .",
    "[ eq : diffandmeasure2d ]    this suggest that a remnant of the dual conformal symmetry can be found in the effective two - dimensional theory that arises in the regge limit by simply introducing @xmath25-variables , related to the incoming , transverse momenta @xmath31 by _",
    "-_i+1  , [ eq : xi2d ] and then acting on the @xmath25-variables in the standard way . together with the inversions ,",
    "one also has translation symmetry ( since the @xmath25 only enter as the differences ) as well as rotation symmetry . in total , this constitutes the group @xmath2 .",
    "since our main motivation for looking at the dual @xmath2 was to try to understand the integrability of the generalized lla spin chain , we should see what form it takes for color singlet exchange . as a first step one",
    "is led to search for a dual @xmath2 symmetry of the bfkl equation .",
    "this equation can be interpreted , in the effective two - dimensional theory that arises in the regge limit , as giving the leading approximation to the scattering amplitude @xmath32 of 2 to 2 reggeized gluons , with color singlet exchange in the @xmath15-channel .",
    "if we label the incoming momenta of these reggeized gluons as @xmath33 , we can introduce @xmath25-variables using , in terms of which the bfkl equation takes the form @xmath34 with the integration kernel given by k(_1 , _ 2 , _ 3 , _",

    "i1 ) = -   [ eq : kernelrx ] and @xmath35 is the gluon regge trajectory .",
    "the variable @xmath36 is , despite the notation , which we keep for historical reasons , not the gluon trajectory , but rather the mellin transform conjugate of @xmath37 .    in @xcite we showed that is invariant under a formal dual @xmath2 symmetry , which acts on the @xmath7 variables in the same way that the @xmath2 of lipatov acts on impact parameter space .",
    "the symmetry requires that @xmath36 be invariant , which either means that we should not transform the longitudinal components of the momenta at all , or should require that the scale @xmath17 transform in the same way as @xmath38 .",
    "the dual @xmath2 is only a formal symmetry of the bfkl equation and the gluon regge trajectory , and is expected to be affected by the ir divergences present . in bfkl",
    "the divergences cancel , so one could hope that the symmetry remains unaltered , but as mentioned in @xcite this is unfortunately not the case .",

    "the solution to bfkl can be constructed , order by order , by iterating the equation , regularizing and canceling infrared divergences at each order . in general , the solution can be written f = f_1 ( ) ^(2)(_24)+f_2 ( )  , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is obtained by repeatedly iterating the trajectory part of the kernel , and where @xmath44 must be invariant under dual inversions in order for to hold .",
    "the lowest order of @xmath45 is trivial to calculate , simply being the result of applying the kernel to the inhomogenous delta - function term of . at the next order ,",
    "apart from integrals similar to the trajectory , non - trivial integrals of the form   appear , but as shown in appendix [ app : nfintegral ] their form can be considerably restricted by studying their symmetry properties under dual @xmath2 transformations .",
    "one finds that f_2 ( ) = ( 1 + u -v ) + +  , [ eq : f2 ] where u =   v = are the two independent conformal invariants that can be formed from @xmath46 .",
    "we see that the lowest order is invariant , while the next - to - lowest order , where the trajectories start to matter , is not , containing an anomalous logarithmic term . , but it is simple to check numerically that even for such configurations @xmath47 is not invariant at higher orders . ]",
    "such a logarithm is not completely unexpected , though , since the dual conformal symmetry of @xmath0 sym is broken by infrared divergences . in that case",
    "it seems , fortunately , to be broken in a controlled way .",
    "an @xmath48-particle color - ordered @xmath0 scattering amplitude @xmath49 can always be factorized as _",
    "n = _ n , _",

    "if we instead apply the generator @xmath53 ( to be defined in the next section ) of the dual @xmath2 corresponding to the special conformal transformations to @xmath47 we obtain ( to order @xmath54 ) i k_^(d ) f_2 = 2_1 ( ) ( x_1 + x_3 - x_2 - x_4 )  , [ eq : ward2d ] where @xmath55 here is a two - dimensional index , where @xmath56 , and where we omit the bold font from the @xmath25 when writing them out in components .",
    "this is a rather simple structure , which stems from the fact that the anomalous term is a simple logarithm , to lowest order , while the anomalous terms in the finite part of @xmath0 amplitudes consist of squares of logarithms .",
    "the important question is now if this structure is exact to all loops , as seems to be the case in the four - dimensional gauge theory .",
    "unfortunately , it is not .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to see this analytically is to consider the forward limit , defined by @xmath57 , or equivalently @xmath58 , where calculations simplify considerably .",

    "[ eq : f2forward ] as a result does not hold to all orders in bfkl .",
    "this does not mean that the dual @xmath2 symmetry is broken beyond repair , however .",
    "it simply means that the way that the representation of the symmetry is deformed by the coupling is not as simple as in the case of @xmath0 .",
    "one way to understand that the structure of the representation of the dual @xmath2 may be complicated even though it may stem from the simple dual conformal symmetry is to visualize , in the standard way , the iteration of the bfkl equation as a sum over effective ladder diagrams .",
    "these diagrams can then , in turn , be written , by unitarity , as a product of tree - level amplitudes . summing over the rungs of the ladder",
    "will then sum over products of tree - amplitudes with a different number of legs , and consequently different dual conformal weights .    an alternative way to see",
    "this is to regularize the bfkl equation in such a way that the dual @xmath2 invariance is preserved by adapting the procedure of @xcite , introducing different scales which are allowed to transform independently under inversions .",
    "then one finds that new scales must be introduced when iterating the equation .",
    "incidentally , this means that without a more detailed description of how the dual @xmath2 is represented at higher orders it can not be used to constrain the form of @xmath32 .",
    "still , we believe that it is possible to deform the representation of the dual @xmath2 in such a way to make it an all order symmetry . at the algebraic level , the dual @xmath2 would then be a perfectly well defined symmetry of the bfkl equation . also , as discussed at the end of the next section , at least the lowest order correction will not change the commutation of the original and dual @xmath2 , keeping open the possibility that the algebra obtained at leading order describes an exact symmetry of bfkl .",
    "in @xmath0 sym , when taken together , the ordinary and dual superconformal symmetries generate an infinite dimensional yangian algebra @xcite .",
    "the same yangian appears in the study of the spectrum of the dilatation operator @xcite , which is believed to define the hamiltonian of an integrable system @xcite , and could therefore explain the great amount of structure observed also for scattering amplitudes . indeed , it has recently been shown @xcite that the grassmannian integral @xcite conjectured to give the amplitudes leading singularities to all orders is the most general invariant of the yangian algebra of this kind . continuing this line of thought",
    ", perhaps the original and dual @xmath2 algebras of bfkl may explain its integrability when taken together .",
    "in this section we will check what form the closure of the two @xmath2 algebras takes .",
    "in the case of @xmath0 ( where a supersymmetric version of the serre relations apply ) , the ordinary @xmath3 can be taken to make up the level 0 generators , while the level 1 generators can be extracted from the dual superconformal algebra .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that in the representation acting on the scattering amplitudes , where the level 0 generators are written as a sum over external particles as j_a^(0 ) = _ i^n j_ia^(0 )  , the level 1 generators could be written in the bi - local form j_a^(1)=f_a^bc_1j",

    ". this bi - local form guarantees the commutation relation , and together with some additional requirements satisfied by the representation in question the serre relations are also implied @xcite .",
    "recently , it has also been shown that the role of the ordinary and dual algebras can be interchanged , taking the dual superconformal algebra to make up the level 0 generators @xcite .",
    "let us first review the action of the original @xmath2 symmetry of the bfkl hamiltonian , discovered by lipatov in @xcite , which we will take to play the role of the level 0 generators @xmath64 .",

    "1j < i n ( p_i_j + p_j_i - _ i _ j - ( i j ) ) + 10p_1 + 6 p_2 + 4p_3  , which can be rewritten ( in two dimensions ) as _",

    "the only one that remains unaccounted for is _",
    "1j < i n 2 ( p_j - p_i)= 4 ( ( n-1)p_1 + ( n-2)p_2 + + p_n-1 - ( n-1)p _ )  . for the case that interests us , which is @xmath102 , this becomes , after discarding the term proportional to @xmath108 , 12 p_1 + 8 p_2 + 4p_3  , which is almost , but not exactly , equal to the term @xmath120 , present in .",
    "the difference is @xmath121 .",
    "we must thus conclude that , in contrast to the case of @xmath0 sym , the bi - local operators @xmath122 are in general not symmetries of the green s function .",
    "we instead have the symmetries j^(1)__^(1 ) - 2 q _  .",
    "[ eq : p1 ] commuting these generators with the level 0 algebra gives the rest of the `` level 1 '' generators , all of which can be written as as j^(1)_a ^(1)_a - 2j^(0)_(12)a  , [ eq : ja1sym ] where j^(0)_(12)a_i=1 ^ 2j^(0)_ia   are the level 0 generators restricted to the first two ( upper ) momenta , and where the @xmath123 are defined by the bi - local formula .",
    "it should be noted , that the reason that we are forced to deform the @xmath124 generators is the non - symmetrical action of the dual conformal inversions .",
    "the @xmath125 would have been symmetries if @xmath126 had produced a factor @xmath127 under inversions .",
    "for which the inversion produces the factor @xmath128 , consistent with the bi - local formula because the relevant constants appearing in the generators ( such as the constant in the dilatation operator ) are half of what they are in the present case . ]",
    "notable is that in the forward limit @xmath57 , and then the bi - local operators will indeed be symmetries .",
    "this case is particularly important , since it is related , via the optical theorem , to the total cross section . in @xcite",
    "it was discussed how ir safe quantities , which includes the total cross section , retain the superconformal symmetry of @xmath0 .",
    "by contrast , in order to promote the superconformal symmetry of tree amplitudes beyond tree level , an analysis carried out in @xcite , the generators must be non - trivially deformed .",
    "this suggests that a more direct link to the integrable structure of @xmath0 might be found by looking at the forward limit .",
    "so , does the original @xmath2 together with generate a yangian ?",
    "it follows from the form of the bi - local formula that the yangian commutation relations are satisfied with the @xmath129 , implying that they are also obeyed by the full @xmath130 , since the additional @xmath131 piece simply gives the level 0 algebra restricted to particles 1 and 2 .",
    "the key issue is therefore whether the serre relations - are satisfied .    for many algebras , such as @xmath3",
    "the first serre relation implies the second one @xcite .",
    "and in our case the first serre relation is indeed satisfied .",
    "however , for @xmath2 it is trivially satisfied ( its structure constants imply it take the form @xmath132 ) , meaning that it is the second serre relation that must be checked .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out to not be satisfied . from the form of and it is clear that if the right hand side of the first relation is zero , the right hand side of the second relation must also be so .",
    "but , a quick check reveals that the left hand side becomes non - zero when using the generators .",
    "so it does not seem that the closure of the original and dual @xmath2-algebras give a yangian algebra .",
    "this does not mean that the algebra can not be infinite dimensional , though .",
    "the generators @xmath133 do not close under commutation , and from their form it seems unlikely that their closure would be finite - dimensional .",
    "an important issue is also whether the algebra itself is affected when the representation of the dual @xmath2 is deformed to @xmath134 in order to take into consideration the anomaly .",
    "the full form of the deformed generator becomes j^(1)_a ( ) = ^(1)_a - 2j^(0)_(12)a - 2 j^(0)_(13)a + ( ^2 )  , [ eq : ja1symdef ] where @xmath135 is defined analogously to @xmath136 .",
    "interestingly , in the same way that the shift in by @xmath137 does not alter the commutation relation , neither does the change in . also when considering the rest of the algebra , generated by @xmath64 and @xmath134 it does not seem that the commutation relations are altered by the introduction of the coupling dependence , meaning that the algebra obtained at lowest order may very well be exact to all orders of bfkl .",
    "we will , however , leave the exact determination of this algebraic structure to future studies .",
    "in this article we have continued the study of how the symmetries of @xmath0 sym may explain the integrability found in the regge limit of qcd , examining the bfkl equation .",
    "the conclusion is that even though much of the structure present in the four - dimensional gauge theory remains ( original and dual @xmath2 as remnants of ordinary and dual conformal symmetry , generators in the bi - local form , etc ) , it seems that , algebraically , things get considerably more complicated in this limit . in particular , the yangian symmetry is broken , and the dual @xmath2 does not satisfy a simple all - loop anomalous ward identity , although the possibility remains that the algebra itself be coupling independent to all orders",
    ". these difficulties probably result from breaking the symmetries corresponding to the longitudinal and fermionic generators upon taking the regge limit , since the structure of the yangian of @xmath0 seems intimately related to supersymmetry ( the bi - local form of the level 1 generators is , for example , only compatible with the cyclicity of the amplitudes for a set of superalgebras @xcite . ) .",
    "there are several possible directions for future research .",
    "it would , of course , be nice to find an all - order representation of the dual @xmath2 .",
    "but perhaps a more immediate issue is to extend this analysis to the full generalized lla spin chain of @xcite , and see if the structure of conserved charges can be related to the closure of the two @xmath2 algebras .",
    "another possibility is to study the bk equation @xcite , giving unitarity corrections to bfkl by taking into account transitions from 2 to 4 reggeized gluons . since it was shown in @xcite that the @xmath138 to @xmath139 reggeized gluon vertex has the same dual @xmath2 covariance as the @xmath138 to @xmath138 vertex present in bfkl , and in @xcite that it has the original @xmath2-invariance",
    ", it seems likely that the entire equation has this symmetry .",
    "a more fundamental step that remains in order to understand the symmetries of the regge limit is precisely to elucidate exactly how , not only the dual , but also the original @xmath2 symmetry of lipatov is implied by the symmetries of the four dimensional gauge theory .",
    "the solution to this problem is bound to be interesting , especially at nlla , since the conformal symmetry is broken at loop level in @xmath0 .",
    "one source of the breaking is the introduction of an infrared regulator .",
    "since bfkl is ir finite one could think that this is not a problem , but we have seen in the form of the breaking of the dual @xmath2 that ir effects can still cause problems . a second",
    ", trickier problem is that the generators of the superconformal symmetry must be deformed in a non - trivial way at one - loop and beyond @xcite .",
    "this deformation must somehow disappear before arriving at the @xmath2 symmetry of the regge limit , since the latter is exact to all orders , also at nlla , with no deformation present .",
    "* acknowledgments *    we are grateful to j. drummond , c. gmez and a. sabio vera for comments and discussions . the work of j. g. is supported by a spanish fpu grant .",
    "in this appendix we will show how the form of the integral i_1   [ eq : nfintegral ] can be restricted by using dual @xmath2 symmetry , thus exemplifying how this symmetry can play a role in simplifying calculations .",
    "first , we note that the integrand of @xmath140 has the same behavior close to the singularities at @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , and the same transformation properties under dual @xmath2 transformations as the integrand of i_2 d^2_i  , which can be evaluated directly in dimensional regularization using , where u =   v =   are the two independent dual @xmath2 invariants that can be formed from @xmath144 .",
    "this implies that the integral @xmath145 will be finite and that we can apply the dual conformal symmetry to conclude that i_1-i_2 = i(u , v )  , [ eq : i1mi2 ] for some function @xmath146 of the conformal invariants .",
    "next , we observe that both @xmath140 and @xmath147 are symmetric under the interchanges @xmath148 , producing u  , v   v  , [ eq:23swap ] as well as @xmath149 which gives uv  .",
    "[ eq:34swap ] when applied to these symmetries give i(u , v)=v i ( , )   i(u , v)=i(v , u )  , [ eq : symi ] which implies that i(u , v ) = ( 1+u+v)g(_1 , _ 2 )  , for some function @xmath150 , where _ 1 =   _ 2 =   are two independent invariants of and .",
    "the difference between the two integrals @xmath140 and @xmath147 is further restricted by noting that for some values of @xmath144 , their integrands coincide for all values of the integration variable .",
    "this occurs , for example , if @xmath90 equals one of the other @xmath95 , translating to @xmath151 .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the two integrands are equal for all @xmath28 precisely when = 1/4  , [ eq : integrandequal ] implying that @xmath152 , for arbitrary @xmath153 . as a consequence we can write i(u , v ) = ( 1+u+v)(4 -1)h(_1 , _ 2 ) = h(_1 , _ 2 )  , [ eq : ifinal ] where @xmath154 must be finite , for all @xmath153 , when @xmath155 .",
    "it does not seem that we can obtain anything more from symmetry considerations alone .",
    "still , from equations and we see that the form of @xmath140 is greatly restricted .",
    "it should then not come as a surprise that in fact @xmath156 , as can easily be checked for any arbitrary choice of the @xmath95 .",
    "this analysis can also be applied to restrict the form of more complicated integrals .",
    "for example , at the third iteration of the bfkl equation , integrals such as i_3 = ( )   appear .",
    "if we define @xmath157 by exchanging @xmath158 for the integrand of @xmath147 , then @xmath159 will once again be restricted by dual @xmath2 symmetry , symmetry under the exchange of @xmath148 , and the condition that the difference vanishes when is satisfied .",
