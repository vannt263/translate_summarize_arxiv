    "choose eight pebbles , @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) from among the @xmath210 pebbles  there are at most @xmath214 choices  and five new pebbles @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) such that @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 is the sextuplet of forbidding lines in the claim , and @xmath220 is a pebble in the lower half . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that the `` middle '' pebbles of unknown position @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) , as well as @xmath221 in known position , are in between the other defining pebble of the forbidding line concerned and its intercept with the lower grid line containing @xmath220 .",
    "that is , the top - to - bottom order a forbidding line is @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and so on .",
    "then , a forbidding line determined by an outermost pebble and an intercept , together with the grid line containing the middle pebble , enables us to determine the grid point on which the middle pebble is located .",
    "an error in the position of the intercept leads to a smaller error in the position of the middle pebble .",
    "thus , a precision of the position of the intercept up to @xmath224 , together with the precise position of the outermost pebble , enables us to determine the grid point containing the middle pebble as the unique grid point in a circle with radius @xmath224 centered on the computed geometric point .",
    "the coordinates of the five unknown @xmath215 s are determined by ( i ) the locations of the five intercepts of the associated quintuplet of forbidding lines with the lower half horizontal grid line on which @xmath220 is located , and ( ii ) the five unknown distances between these intercepts and the @xmath215 s along the five associated forbidding lines .",
    "the grid point positions of the @xmath215 s are uniquely determined if we know the latter distances up to precision @xmath225 .",
    "all six intercepts in the statement of the theorem are in an interval of length @xmath226 which contains @xmath227 grid points ( rounded to the appropriate close entier value ) .",
    "we can describe every intercept in this interval ( up to the required precision ) in @xmath228 bits .",
    "relative to the intersection of the known forbidding line @xmath229 , therefore , item ( i ) uses @xmath230 bits . item ( ii ) uses @xmath231 bits .",
    "given @xmath123 , we can describe the placement of the @xmath210 pebbles in @xmath232 bits ; the choice of the eight pebbles among them in @xmath233 bits ; and we have shown that the placement of the five unknown pebbles can be reconstructed from an additional @xmath234 bits .",
    "together this forms a description of the complete arrangement . by ( [ eq.inc1 ] ) this implies : @xmath235 a now familiar calculation using ( [ eq.ass ] ) yields @xmath236 , for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath237 .",
    "this shows @xmath238 for some positive constant @xmath208 .",
    "substituting @xmath239 proves the claim .",
    "we have now established that there are @xmath182 distinct forbidding lines ( with @xmath179 as in claim  [ cl.n2lines ] ) determined by pairs of pebbles in the upper half , and by construction every such forbidding line intersects every lower half horizontal grid line . moreover ,",
    "every @xmath226-length interval ( with @xmath226 as in claim  [ cl.uppline ] ) on a lower half horizontal grid line  that contains a pebble  contains at most six intercepts of forbidding lines .",
    "this means that we can select @xmath240 consecutive intercepts on such a grid line that are separated by intervals of at least length @xmath226 .",
    "the two pebbles @xmath138 defining the forbidding line @xmath241 , together with any pebble @xmath137 on a lower half horizontal grid line @xmath242 , determine a triangle .",
    "if @xmath32 is the distance between the intercept point of @xmath241 with @xmath242 and the pebble @xmath137 , and @xmath243 is the angle between the forbidding line @xmath241 and grid line @xmath242 , then the triangle side located on the forbidding line has length @xmath244 while the height of the triangle with respect to that side is @xmath245 .",
    "thus , if @xmath3 is the area of the smallest triangle formed by any three pebbles , then @xmath246 . consequently , all grid positions in intervals of length @xmath175 on both sides of an intercept of a forbidding line with a lower half grid line  that contains a pebble are forbidden for pebble placement .",
    "as long as @xmath247 , or @xmath248 this means that the @xmath240 consecutive intercepts exclude @xmath249 grid positions from pebble placement on the horizontal lower grid line concerned . if ( [ eq.f2 ] ) does not hold , that is , @xmath250 , then at least @xmath251 grid positions are excluded .",
    "given the pebbles in the upper half , and therefore the forbidding lines , the excluded grid points in the lower half are determined . therefore , with @xmath252 and also given the horizontal lower half grid line concerned , we can place a pebble on the grid line in at most @xmath253 positions .",
    "we now use this fact to construct a short encoding of the total arrangement of the @xmath1 pebbles satisfying ( [ eq.inc1 ] ) : select @xmath1 horizontal grid lines ( there can be only one pebble per grid line by lemma  [ cl.noline ] ) chosen from the total of @xmath115 grid lines ",
    "there are @xmath254 choices .",
    "select on everyone of the upper @xmath177 horizontal grid lines a grid point to place a pebble  there are @xmath255 choices . finally , select in order from top to bottom on the lower @xmath177 horizontal grid lines @xmath177 grid points to place the pebbles  there are only @xmath256 choices by ( [ eq.excl ] ) .",
    "together these choices form a description of the arrangement . given the values of @xmath123 we can encode these choices in self - delimiting items , and by ( [ eq.inc1 ] ) this implies : @xmath257 using ( [ eq.ass ] ) with @xmath1 fixed yields @xmath258 the left - hand side @xmath259 so that @xmath260 since @xmath261 in the right - hand side , claim  [ cl.uppline ] shows that @xmath262 .",
    "therefore , ( [ eq.b ] ) implies @xmath263 so that ( [ eq.fn ] ) establishes the theorem .",
    "if @xmath1 points are chosen independently and at random ( uniform distribution ) in the unit square , and @xmath3 is the least area of a triangle formed by three points , then for every positive @xmath264 ( @xmath265 ) , we have @xmath266 with probability at least @xmath120 .    that is , the probability that @xmath267 at least @xmath173 ( @xmath172 ) , the probability that @xmath268 is at least @xmath269 ( @xmath270 ) , and so on . since @xmath271 , we can upper bound the expectation @xmath7 of @xmath3 by upper bounding the probability of @xmath3 with @xmath272 by @xmath273 $ ] .",
