    "a _ toric variety _ @xmath1 of complex dimension @xmath2 is a normal algebraic variety over @xmath3 containing the algebraic torus @xmath4 as an open dense subset , such that the natural action of @xmath4 on itself extends to @xmath1 , where @xmath5 .",
    "toric manifold _ is a smooth compact toric variety .",
    "the orbit space @xmath6 of a toric manifold @xmath1 by the restricted action of the compact torus @xmath7 is a manifold with corners such that all faces are contractible and any non - empty intersection of faces is connected .",
    "if @xmath1 is projective , then a moment map identifies the orbit space @xmath6 with a simple polytope , so the orbit space is homeomorphic to a simple polytope as a manifold with corners .",
    "any toric manifold of complex dimension @xmath8 is projective .",
    "although there are many non - projective toric manifolds in complex dimension @xmath9 , their orbit spaces are all homeomorphic to simple polytopes as manifolds with corners ; this follows from steinitz s theorem on planar graphs . in higher dimensions",
    ", it has been unknown whether this is still the case .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to prove the following theorem :    [ main theorem ] for any integer @xmath10 , there are infinitely many toric manifolds @xmath1 of complex dimension @xmath2 whose orbit spaces @xmath6 are not homeomorphic to any simple polytope as manifolds with corners .    a _ quasitoric manifold _",
    "@xmath1 of ( real ) dimension @xmath11 over a simple polytope @xmath12 is a closed smooth manifold with a smooth action of @xmath13 such that the action is locally standard and the orbit space @xmath6 is the simple polytope @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the restricted action of @xmath13 on a toric manifold of complex dimension @xmath2 is always locally standard .",
    "therefore , if a toric manifold is projective or @xmath14 , then it is a quasitoric maniofld @xcite .",
    "our theorem implies that if @xmath10 , then there are infinitely many toric manifolds of complex dimension @xmath2 which are not quasitoric manifolds . in a 2003 preprint , y. civan @xcite claimed the existence of a toric manifold as in theorem [ main theorem ] , but his proof is unclear .",
    "our construction is based on ideas in @xcite but more explicit .",
    "simplicial @xmath2-sphere _ is a simplicial complex which is homeomorphic to @xmath15 .",
    "a simplicial sphere is _ polytopal _ if it is combinatorially equivalent to the boundary complex of a simplicial polytope .",
    "the orbit space @xmath6 of a toric manifold @xmath1 is homeomorphic to a simple convex polytope if and only if the underlying simplicial complex of the fan of @xmath1 is polytopal @xcite .",
    "the barnette sphere is a simplicial @xmath9-sphere which is not polytopal @xcite .",
    "however , the barnette sphere can not be the underlying simplicial complex of a non - singular fan ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9.1 ) .",
    "so we first find a simplicial singular fan whose underlying simplicial complex is the barnette sphere and change it into a non - singular fan by subdivision while keeping the non - polytopality of the underlying simplicial complex .",
    "our proof of non - polytopality is similar to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem , chapter iii ) .",
    "thus we obtain a desired toric manifold @xmath1 of complex dimension @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , we can produce infinitely many such toric manifolds by performing subdivision and suspension on the fan of @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we give a fan whose underlying simplicial complex is the barnette sphere . in section 3 , we prove theorem [ main theorem ] .",
    "the barnette sphere is a simplicial @xmath9-sphere consisting of @xmath17 vertices @xmath18 @xmath19 described by the diagram as in figure [ barnette2 ] , see @xcite for details .",
    "we assign to the vertices of the barnette sphere certain points in @xmath20 , as follows : @xmath21 are the standard basis of @xmath22 , and @xmath23 let @xmath24 be the set consisting of 19 @xmath16-dimensional cones as in table [ barnette ] and their faces .",
    "the determinant of the matrix formed by four edge vectors of each @xmath16-dimensional cone in @xmath24 is as in table [ barnette ] .",
    ".@xmath16-dimensional cones in @xmath24 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now we have a refinement @xmath25 of @xmath24 which has @xmath26 edges and @xmath27 @xmath16-dimensional cones . the determinant of each @xmath16-dimensional cone of @xmath25 is @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "so @xmath25 is a non - singular complete fan and the corresponding toric variety @xmath30 is a toric manifold .",
    "[ non - polytopality ] the underlying simplicial complex @xmath31 is not polytopal . so the orbit space @xmath32 of the corresponding toric manifold @xmath30 is not homeomorphic to any simple polytope as a manifold with corners , that is , @xmath30 is not a quasitoric manifold .",
    "our proof is similar to the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem , chapter iii ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath31 is polytopal .",
    "we denote the @xmath9-simplex corresponding to @xmath33 by @xmath34 and denote a @xmath9-simplex by its arranged vertices .",
    "take a schlegel diagram of @xmath31 to the @xmath9-simplex @xmath35 .",
    "the two @xmath9-simplices @xmath36 and @xmath37 intersect along the common face @xmath38 , and the point @xmath39 is not in @xmath40 .",
    "the star @xmath41 of the edge @xmath42 is the union of the six @xmath9-simplices @xmath43 .",
    "since the link @xmath44 of @xmath42 consists of the simplices in @xmath41 which do not intersect @xmath42 , it consists of six edges @xmath45 ( see figure [ fig : one ] ) .     to the simplex @xmath46 . ]",
    "consider the projection of the diagram figure [ fig : one ] onto a plane . since @xmath39 is not in @xmath47 nor in @xmath48",
    ", @xmath39 must be a point such that the two triangles @xmath49 and @xmath50 are linked as links of a chain .",
    "so their images on the plane intersect .",
    "thus the image of the diagram in figure [ fig : one ] onto a plane falls into seven types in figure [ fig : two ] essentially .",
    "the former three diagrams in figure [ fig : two ] are the case where each point of @xmath51 is a boundary point of the image of @xmath46 , and the latter four diagrams in figure [ fig : two ] are the case where one point of @xmath51 is an interior point of the image of @xmath46",
    ". the positions of the points @xmath52 and @xmath39 may differ from the graphs , but in any case , the image of @xmath44 has a self - intersection .",
    "however , if the simplicial complex is polytopal , the link of any edge can be projected onto a plane perpendicular to the affine hull of the edge without self - intersection .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "thus we proved the proposition .",
    "the main theorem is deduced by using the fan @xmath25 .",
    "subdividing the cone @xmath53 in @xmath25 by its interior point @xmath54 , we have another toric manifold of complex dimension @xmath16 whose orbit space by the compact torus is not homeomorphic to any simple polytope as a manifold with corners .",
    "successive subdivisions produce infinitely many such toric manifolds .    if a simplicial sphere is non - polytopal , then its suspension is also non - polytopal . because if its suspension were polytopal , the link of a new vertex would also be polytopal , which contradicts that the link is the original non - polytopal simplicial sphere .",
    "thus for any @xmath10 , we have infinitely many toric manifolds of complex dimension @xmath2 whose orbit spaces by the compact torus are not homeomorphic to any simple polytope as manifolds with corners .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ main theorem ] .",
