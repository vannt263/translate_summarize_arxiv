    "the study of various physical properties of carbon nanotubes has received a lot of attention during the last few years . in particular , b. hartmann et al @xcite have recently studied the electron - phonon interaction on a hexagonal lattice .",
    "their approach was , however , limited in its scope as it did not take into account the possible displacement of atoms in the direction perpendicular to the nanotube . to address this problem",
    ", we have to introduce three phonon fields , two of which are tangent to the tube while the third one is perpendicular to it .",
    "the introduction of such a transversal field is not very straightforward .",
    "it requires the generalization of the phonon hamiltonian to describe the bending elasticity of the tube .",
    "such a generalization is presented in this paper for the case of a nanocircle .",
    "a study of the electron - phonon interaction in a simple model where such a transversal field is introduced , paves the way towards the study of a more relevant model describing carbon nanotubes .",
    "it also describes various physical properties , including the conductivity and conformational states , of other physical systems such as circular macromolecules , cyclic organic , inorganic and semi - inorganic polymeric macromolecules .",
    "our model describes a circular closed chain of monomers which are allowed to move in the plane spanned by the circle at rest .",
    "thus , it is a two - dimensional model where deformations in the direction perpendicular to the circle plane , are not allowed .",
    "one can think of this model as a crude cross section of a carbon nanotube , though obviously , the hexagonal symmetry of the carbon nanotube , and its three - dimensional nature require a more general description .",
    "nevertheless , our hope is to gain some understanding of how one can take into account the transversal displacement of atoms .    at the same time",
    ", our model does describe real physical low - dimensional cyclic nanosystems that include a large class of end - linked natural and synthetic low - dimensional macromolecules and nanosystems with a circular structure . amongst them",
    "one finds the cyclic biological macromolecules , such as intact dna from most prokaryotes and viruses , mitochondria plasmid dna @xcite , cyclic dna macroarrays used for the systematic screening of gene expression @xcite .",
    "large circular single stranded rnas form genomic material of viroids @xcite .",
    "some of the oligoribonucleotides with known biological activity are also cyclic molecules @xcite .",
    "the so called  second messengers \" also have a circular structure . amongst them",
    "are the messengers which regulate the channels involved in the initiation of impulses in neurons responding to odors and light , messengers which function as calcium regulated transcription factors or as a substrate for depolarization - activated calcium calmodulin - dependent protein kinases i and ii ( e.g. , camp response element - binding protein , known also as creb protein ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are also messengers which induce and control transcription from the proximal promoter of the human aromatase responsible for the metabolism of steroids @xcite .",
    "therefore , our study of distortions of molecular nano - circles due to electron - phonon coupling could bring some insight into the structure - function relationship of biological macromolecules .",
    "end - linked organic , inorganic and semi - inorganic polymers are now known as functional materials with applications as biologically active species , catalyst supports , charge carriers etc .",
    "for instance , the long - chain circular esters are used for soft lenses , cyclic trimeric phosphazene rings are valuable technological materials for their high heat resistance and flame retardant behaviour .",
    "polysiloxanes , which are the main components of silicone products , are one of the most important cyclic materials ( @xcite and references cited therein ) .    the circular structure of these macromolecules , their relative softness , deformability and ability to form cross - linking suggest modelling such systems by a nanocircle of periodically placed monomers of a given length .",
    "under certain conditions one or several monomers of the nanocircle can be excited by an external field ( light or electromagnetic radiation , trapping of extra electron or hole , etc . ) .",
    "such an excitation , called in what follows , a quasiparticle , can move onto the neighbouring monomers and cause a local distortion of the ring due to the electron - phonon coupling . in a linear chain it can lead to the change of properties of the quasiparticle , depending on the strength of the coupling . at weak coupling",
    "the quasiparticle remains almost free , at strong coupling it is trapped on one site ( a small polaron is formed ) , while at intermediate values of the coupling a self - trapping occurs within few lattice sites and a nonlinear soliton - like state is formed @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the physical properties of systems at different regimes of localisation differ significantly , and , therefore , the classification of systems by their electron ground states is important .",
    "one can expect that , depending on the strength of the electron - phonon coupling , similar regimes take place in a very large end - linked circle .",
    "however , this is not clear for a circle of a finite and not very large length .",
    "this problem is studied in the present paper .",
    "we start by deriving a hamiltonian describing the elastic properties of a nanocircle and a hamiltonian describing the interaction between the elecron and the phonon fields .",
    "we then derive the corresponding system of discrete equations and compute solutions for this model .",
    "we show that the model exhibits several classes of solutions depending on the values of the parameters .",
    "in particular , we show that the electron - phonon interaction leads to the self - trapping of a quasiparticle and introduces a deformation of the chain .",
    "we consider a molecular chain which consists of periodically repeated units ( atoms or groups of atoms ) bound by chemical or hydrogen bonds .",
    "we assume that these bonds between the units are directed in such a way that , for a molecular chain with free ends , the minimum of the free energy corresponds to a linear one - dimensional structure in which chain sites are placed at the equilibrium distance @xmath0 and all intersite bonds are directed along the chain axis .",
    "we focus our attention on a study of the molecular chain which is closed to form a circle ( before any deformations are allowed ) .",
    "the equilibrium positions of the chain sites are determined by the radius - vectors @xmath1\\ ] ] where the centre of the coordinate system is placed at the centre of the circle , @xmath2 is the circle radius , @xmath3 enumerates the chain sites , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of sites in the ring , and @xmath6 is an arbitrary angle .",
    "the equilibrium distance between the sites in the molecular circle is @xmath7 which , in general , can differ from @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the radius of the circle is @xmath8 .",
    "note that if there is a bending of chemical bonds at each site @xmath9 , this bending can be described by the angle @xmath10 between the vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath13 i.e. , @xmath14 .    due to the displacements the real positions of the sites are @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the displacement of the site @xmath9 from the equilibrium position .",
    "note that we can represent the vector @xmath16 using the following orthogonal unit vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 we then have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the displacement tangential to the circle while @xmath22 is the displacement perpendicular to the circle ( the tangential and radial components of displacement respectively ) .",
    "thus the real distances between the sites and the bending angles differ from their equilibrium values : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    the vector , which links the site @xmath9 with the @xmath25 one , is @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "so , the distance is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29    to obtain this expression we have assumed that the relative site displacements are small , i.e. @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the deviations of the bending angles from their equilibrium values are also small , and we can write @xmath31 for @xmath32 we can put @xmath33    thus , we have arrived at the following expression for @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36",
    "next , we assume that the individual isolated monomers are characterised by nondegenerate electronic excitations with energy @xmath37 . in the approximation of the nearest neighbour interaction , the total hamiltonian which describes the electronic excitations ( or , in the tight binding approximation , the additional electrons ) and harmonic vibrations in a molecular chain",
    "can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the creation and annihilation operators of the quasiparticle at the @xmath9-th site of the circle , @xmath40 is the on - site electron energy , where @xmath41 is the change of the electron energy due to the influence of the neighbouring sites .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 describes the quasiparticle transfer between the nearest neighbours , and @xmath43 is the hamiltonian of the site displacements .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction is determined by the dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath42 on the positions of the neighbours of the @xmath9-th site .",
    "the term @xmath42 depends on the distance between the sites @xmath44 and , within the linear approximation with respect to the displacements , we can put it as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath41 is determined by the influence of the neighbours ; thus it depends on the distance between them and on the bending angle of the chemical bonds : @xmath48 .",
    "hence the on - site electron energy , within the displacements linear approximation , can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 determine the interaction of the quasiparticle with the chain deformation ( exciton / electron - phonon coupling ) in the linear approximation relative to the site displacements from their equilibrium positions .",
    "due to the symmetry we see that @xmath53 , and we can set @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 thus , @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath58 and in the linear chain the expansion of @xmath59 in series of @xmath34 begins with the quadratic term while the linear term vanishes .",
    "the hamiltonian of the site displacements , @xmath43 , consists of the kinetic and potential energies of displacements .",
    "the potential energy consists of the potential energies of the pairwise interactions , which depend on the distance between the sites , and on the bending contribution .",
    "therefore , the total hamiltonian of the phonons takes the form : @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the mass of a lattice site , @xmath62 are the momentum operators canonically conjugate to the operators of displacements @xmath16 , @xmath63 is the elasticity coefficient due to the change of distance between the molecules from their equilibrium value @xmath0 , and @xmath64 is the elasticity constant responsible for the bending of the bond ( for small bending angles @xmath65 ) .",
    "as our chain is closed to form a circle , we have @xmath66 . from the definition of @xmath67 we see that @xmath68 and , therefore , the equilibrium distance between the lattice sites on the circle remains the same : @xmath69 .",

    "we have shown that one can successfully describe the electron - phonon interaction of a circular chain while taking into account the transversal and longitudinal displacement of the ring of monomers . to achieve this ,",
    "we have introduced a term in the phonon hamiltonian which describes the bending of the chain . this extra displacement can , in turn , be coupled to the quasiparticle and this coupling favours a self - trapping of quasiparticles and the formation of localised soliton - like structures .",
    "the transversal displacement plays an important role in the formation of such states .",
    "the interaction between the quasiparticle and the phonon field leads not only to the localisation of the quasiparticle but also to a deformation of the circle .",
    "depending on the coupling between the two fields , the circle is pinched at the position of the soliton or on the either side of it .",
    "we have studied our model by solving its classical equations numerically .",
    "our numerical studies have shown a great richness of solutions ; hence we have also tried to solve our equations analytically . to do this",
    "we have had to perform several approximations .",
    "we have found that , at least in the regions of validities of these approximations , our analytical results are in good agreement with our numerical results .",
    "our results show that , depending of the choice of the parameters , our model possesses several classes of solutions .",
    "fully delocalised solutions exist for all values of the parameters .",
    "they do not correspond to the ground state when other solutions exist but they are the only solutions when the parameters @xmath468 and @xmath234 are small . on the other hand ,",
    "strongly localised solutions exist when the coupling parameters are large .",
    "for these solutions , the quasiparticle is localised mostly on one lattice site , but the circle is completely distorted , _",
    "i.e. _ the strong localisation applies only to the quasiparticle , not the displacement fields .",
    "we also found some solutions that are localised on two adjacent sites and have a different symmetry .",
    "our study has shown that the electron - phonon interaction on a circular chain leads to the formation of bound states and to the deformation of the chain .",
    "our results can be used to the description of various systems mentioned in the introduction and as a ` warm - up ' stage to the description of various 3-dimensional systems such as _ e.g. _ nanotubes .",
