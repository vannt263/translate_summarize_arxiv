    "in other words , there is a crossover from one @xmath5 regime to the other , and a low @xmath5 conductance of @xmath72 marks the crossover .",
    "these two @xmath5 regimes also exist for the analog with a ` crossover ' conductance of @xmath74 in that case @xcite .",

    "this is consistent with the subband pinning _ exactly at _ @xmath1 .",
    "the rearranging of spin - up and spin - down subbands is also compatible with pinning of spin - up subbands . taken together , rearranging and pinning explain the presence of _ two _ non - quantized structures in the crossing region ( the complement and analog ) , their @xmath26 characteristics , and why these non - quantized structures are separated by a quantized conductance .",
    "additional evidence in support of our interpretation is that similar @xmath26 analysis applied to spin - down subbands explains why the 0.7 structure survives high temperatures @xcite , and explains other spin - asymmetries @xcite .",
    "furthermore , pinning was suggested as an explanation for the unusual thermopower signature of the 0.7 structure @xcite , and it is also consistent with the 0.7 structure shot - noise @xcite signature .    to conclude , we have used dc - bias spectroscopy to study the rearranging of spin - split subbands at crossings .",
    "our results provide _ direct _ evidence that spin - up subbands pin to @xmath1 in the region of the analog and complement structures , and the 0.7 structure .",
    "this , combined with the formation of a spin gap @xcite and the abrupt drop in energy of the spin - down subband @xcite explains the non - quantized conductances of these features , their temperature dependences , and the shot - noise @xcite and thermopower @xcite signatures of the 0.7 structure . as yet , there is no theory that explains why spin - up subbands should pin in this way at crossings and @xmath8 .",
