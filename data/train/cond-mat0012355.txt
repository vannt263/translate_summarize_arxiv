    "the investigation of the magnetic domain formation , in particular in nanostructured ultrathin films , is an active field of current research .",
    "the influence of the atomic morphology on the magnetic properties is known to be especially strong during the initial states of the thin film growth .",
    "a small variation of the preparation conditions may change the corresponding magnetic structure markedly .",
    "this has been shown by the recent progress of highly resolving imaging techniques , which allows for the investigation of the atomic structure as well as of the magnetic domain structure of these nanostructured systems in greater detail @xcite .",
    "for example , a strong dependence of the domain structure on the film morphology has been observed for the co / au(111 ) thin film system yielding a smaller average domain area for rougher co films @xcite .",
    "in addition , we emphasize that the consideration of nonequilibrium states for the investigation of the magnetic domain structure is of particular importance .    in this contribution we study the interplay of the atomic and magnetic structure theoretically . in particular we simulate the spatial and temporal magnetic domain formation during the _ simultaneous _ growth of ultrathin ferromagnetic films . to our knowledge",
    "this problem has not been investigated previously .",
    "the domain structure is calculated within a kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulation applied to a micromagnetic model considering exchange coupling and uniaxial lattice anisotropy .",
    "the average domain area @xmath0 and the average domain roughness @xmath1 of the growing thin film are calculated as functions of coverage @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the domain roughness is defined as the edge - to - area ratio of a domain .    in general , for low coverages the growing thin film",
    "mostly consists of isolated superparamagnetic islands with a domain area of the order of the island area . on the other hand , at higher coverages the coagulation of islands results in a closed ferromagnetic film which allows for the formation of large domains with sizes of the order of about @xmath4 m , as usually observed @xcite .",
    "the crossover between these two extremal domain size ranges is still not well investigated .",
    "also , the quantities determining this transition are not known .",
    "for the simulation of the magnetic properties of the growing thin film we consider the following important features :    \\i ) we take into account an irregular , nanostructured film morphology which is usually present in a realistic thin film system .",
    "this is performed with the help of a simple growth model , allowing for the consideration of a size range between the atomic and the @xmath5m - scale .",
    "the main quantities determining the growth ( island density and -arrangement , growth mode , etc . ) are chosen in accordance with experiments . due to the strong direct exchange coupling each island",
    "is assumed to be single - domain , its magnetization rotates thus coherently @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) in the coverage range near the percolation threshold @xmath6 of the thin film the interplay between the ( irregular ) atomic morphology and the magnetic domain structure is expected to be strongest .",
    "near @xmath6 the domain formation is governed by weak links between the magnetic islands , while the island - island interaction tries to reach a ferromagnetic ( single - domain ) state of the film .",
    "the islands of a homogeneous , periodic island ensemble merge at the same time , thus the crossover from small to large domains takes place simultaneously all over the growing film .",
    "the characteristic times to cross the energy barriers , depending on the anisotropy and the island size , are the same for all islands . for an irregular nanostructure ,",
    "however , the interactions between different island pairs will be strongly nonuniform ( random magnet ) , causing various energy barriers for the magnetic rotation of different islands , and various inherent characteristic times @xcite .",
    "a pre - formation of domains with intermediate areas covering several neighbouring islands is expected .",
    "this property infers much longer magnetic relaxation times to reach the thermal equilibrium than for a periodic island array . in other words ,",
    "such a random ferromagnetic system can be more easily trapped into metastable states with a frozen - in multi - domain structure , and with an average domain size in between the above mentioned extremal sizes . here",
    "the consideration of a realistic irregular atomic structure is especially important .",
    "\\iii ) a finite temperature is taken into account in order to investigate the domain formation of a realistic thin film system .",
    "the temperature affects strongly the probabilities of the island magnetizations to overcome the energy barriers resulting in a long range magnetic order depending on time and temperature .",
    "in addition , also the _ internal _ ( short range ) magnetic order of a single island due to the finite exchange coupling is considered , leading to temperature dependend island - island interactions and lattice anisotropies .",
    "\\iv ) furthermore , we emphasize that for the investigation of such an ensemble of magnetic islands the consideration of states far from thermal equilibrium is very important .",
    "the long relaxation times common to a random magnet may be much larger than typical detecting times .",
    "we expect in particular that in the coverage range around @xmath6 the domain structure with an intermediate average domain area may be observable within the measuring time or the simulation time .",
    "\\v ) most importantly , the equilibrium state also changes permanently , if during the magnetic relaxation the thin film grows steadily .",
    "thus , within our simulation of the magnetic domain stucture we take simultaneously into account the temporal variation of the atomic structure during the thin film growth .",
    "this results consequently in a temporal variation of the magnetic interactions determined by the growth velocity .",
    "the formation of large magnetic domains is expected to be facilitated by an increasing temperature , since then energy barriers can be more easily surmounted .",
    "this will result in a larger average domain area @xmath0 after a given observation time , or a faster formation of larger domains . on",
    "the other hand , fluctuations at elevated temperatures will destroy large domains yielding a smaller average domain area .",
    "thus , a maximum of @xmath7 as a function of temperature during domain formation is expected .",
    "with the same argument we expect a minimum for the average domain roughness @xmath8 .",
    "previous simulations using similar micromagnetic models have been performed mainly for the investigation of the domain structure during the magnetization reversal of thicker ferromagnetic films with a granular structure @xcite . in these studies",
    "the systems have been divided into periodic arrays of identical magnetic cells with a nonuniform distribution of the magnetic interactions between the cells .",
    "in contrast , within our model we consider an _",
    "irregular atomic structure_. different anisotropies and magnetic island - island interactions are caused by the island size dispersion and different common surface areas between neighboring islands . to our knowledge",
    "such a realistic inhomogeneous atomic structure of an ultrathin film in the early states of film growth for the investigation of the spatial domain formation has not been considered previously .",
    "in addition , theoretical investigations often consider equilibrium magnetic structures @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , the relaxation times to reach the equilibrium states may be very long , so that in experiments metastable multi - domain structures are usually observed . in the present study we will simulate such domain patterns by calculating the temporal variation of the magnetic structure far from equilibrium .",
    "since analytical approaches are not available for the study of the domain formation in a large system far from thermal equilibrium , we are forced to apply a kinetic ( time resolved ) monte carlo simulation .",

    "in particular , we have determined the average domain area and domain roughness as functions of the coverage and the temperature .",
    "the results are always averaged over 20 runs for systems with same global parameters determining the thin film growth and the magnetic properties .",

    "[ fig2 ] we show snapshots of resulting magnetic domain structures for different coverages @xmath2 and for the temperature @xmath99  k. as can be seen , for small coverages the domain area resembles the island area .",

    "@xmath101  ml the domains assume an intermediate size , covering several neighboring islands .",
    "we claim that this _ micro - domain structure _ is controlled and stabilized by the nonuniform atomic nanostructure of the growing ultrathin film .    from the atomic and magnetic structures as depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we analyse now the average domain area and domain roughness as functions of coverage and temperature . the average domain area @xmath86 in units of lattice sites is given in fig .",

    "[ fig3](a ) . for coverages",
    "well below the percolation threshold @xmath6 the average domain area is of the order of @xmath102 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in this case",
    "the ultrathin film consists of magnetically almost isolated islands , the exchange coupling between neighboring islands has no large influence .",
    "if no additional long range magnetic interactions such as the dipole coupling or the indirect exchange ( rkky- ) coupling are important , the system of isolated magnetic islands refers to a superparamagnet . due to their small size and their superparamagnetic behaviour",
    "the magnetic domains in this coverage range might be hardly visible with experimental means .    with increasing coverage",
    "the islands start to merge and form large connected islands .",
    "caused by the nonuniform island ensemble the island coalescence does not occur simultaneously in the system . in this coverage region",
    "the average domain area increases considerably , but is still markedly affected by the atomic nanostructure of the thin film .",
    "we find an average domain area definitely larger than the average elementary island area , but still much smaller than the large domain areas for an almost closed ferromagnetic film . due to the irregular atomic structure of the island ensemble ,",
    "the area of the interfaces between neighboring islands differ considerably , resulting in strongly different surface contributions of the energy barriers .",
    "such a distribution of the effective interactions within the island ensemble can be attributed for by a random exchange energy between neighboring island magnetizations .",
    "for such a random magnet metastable spin structures exhibit considerable temporal stabilities , characterized by large magnetic relaxation times @xcite . only after a long time",
    "the system may overcome the energy barriers and reach its equilibrium magnetic state .",
    "we expect that this mechanism also explains the appearance and stability of the magnetic micro - domain structure above the percolation threshold of the thin film as obtained from our calculations , since here the _ irregular atomic morphology",
    "_ causes long magnetic relaxation times .    in case of a _ uniform _ magnetic island structure , including also",
    "the case of a smooth ferromagnetic film , the corresponding relaxation times are much shorter and a micro - domain structure might not be observable .",
    "we have tested this assumption by simulating the domain structure also for a periodic array of identical magnetic islands with equal interactions between them , in contrast to an irregular island system .",
    "as expected , close to @xmath6 the domains increase fast to a large average size .",
    "thus , we conclude that the frozen - in micro - domain structure with an intermediate average domain area is caused by the nonuniform island ensemble . the experimentally observed small domains in ultrathin films with a rough morphology",
    "@xcite are expected to be such a metastable , nonequilibrium magnetic structure .    with further increase of the coverage",
    "a smooth magnetic thin film is obtained , and the domain pattern is mainly determined by competing magnetic interactions ( exchange , anisotropies ) .",
    "the domain area distribution is quite wide , few large domains coexist with a number of small domains . due to the disappearance of these small domains ,",
    "[ fig2](c , d ) , the _ average _ domain area becomes very large .",
    "since the extension of these large domains reaches the size of our unit cell , we emphasize that in the coverage range of about 1.8  2  ml our simulation of the domain structure is influenced by finite size effects .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , our model should not be applied for a smooth film , which is present in this coverage range .    for the temperatures as considered in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , for most coverages @xmath2 a larger average domain area @xmath103 is obtained for a smaller @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig3](b ) , we obtain a maximum of @xmath7 in particular at low @xmath3 .",
    "the reason is that for low temperatures the domain formation is hindered by energy barriers .",
    "since with an increasing @xmath3 the probability to overcome energy barriers becomes larger , an increasing average domain area is obtained . on the other hand , due to thermal agitation",
    "a large domain may disintegrate into domains with smaller sizes , resulting in a decreasing average domain area with increasing temperatures .",
    "while approaching the curie temperature @xmath104  k the average domain area drops considerably . with an increasing coverage @xmath2 the maximum of @xmath7 is shifted to larger temperatures , since the increasing average magnetic energy between the islands is better suited to withstand thermal agitations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a , b ) we present results for the average domain roughness as functions of the coverage @xmath2 and the temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the domain roughness is characterized by the edge - to - area ratio of the domains . as described in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present here the _ relative _ domain roughness @xmath105 with respect to the minimal roughness @xmath106 of circularly shaped domains .",
    "values @xmath107 result from single - domain states of the simulated films .",
    "similar as for the average domain area @xmath7 , an increasing temperature facilitates the surmount of energy barriers , and the domains may assume a more compact average shape , i.e.  are less rough .",
    "in contrast , an even higher temperature will destroy ordered structures in particular at their surface .",
    "consequently , a minimum of @xmath108 as function of @xmath3 is observed , see fig . [ fig4](b ) .",
    "evidently , the relative roughness depends also on the average domain area and the connectivity of the system , as can be seen from fig . [ fig4](a ) .",
    "an increasing temperature tends to smoothen the domains with a large area at larger coverages @xmath2 . for lower coverages ,",
    "however , the opposite behavior is observed : a larger roughness for an increasing temperature . this might be explained by the fact that in this coverage range the average domain area and the connectivity between the islands",
    "are comparably small so that the disordering effect resulting from thermal fluctuations dominates the smoothening due to a facilitated surmount of energy barriers .",
    "in this study we have investigated the magnetic domain structure of an ultrathin film in the early states of film growth . here",
    "the influence of the film morphology on the domain formation is especially strong .",
    "a model has been applied which is suited in particular for nanostructured systems , as well as for the consideration of nonequilibrium states . to our knowledge ,",
    "the occurrence and relative stability of the domain structure has not been considered previously in connection with a growing magnetic thin film @xcite .    the average domain area and the average relative domain roughness have been calculated as functions of the coverage and the temperature .",
    "in particular , we find an interesting metastable micro - domain structure near the percolation threshold of the thin film .",
    "the average area of these domains ranges between the area of the elementary islands and the large domains of a smooth ferromagnetic film .",
    "we conclude that this nonequilibrium micro - domain structure is controlled and stabilized by the nonuniform spatial ( nano- ) structure of the thin film .",
    "such a mechanism could lead to the unusually small domains observed in rough ferromagnetic films @xcite .",
    "similar as in a random magnet a distribution of the magnetic couplings , as present in an irregular system , causes large magnetic relaxation times . for a thin film system with a periodic array of magnetic islands ( positions , sizes , shapes , interactions ) ,",
    "a micro - domain structure might not be observable , since large domains will evolve fast due to a short relaxation time .",
    "the average domain area is found to increase with increasing coverage , and to exhibit a maximum as function of the temperature .",
    "similarly , according to our calculations the average roughness shows a maximum as function of the coverage and a minimum as function of the temperature .",
    "we have considered single - domain magnetic islands with a collinear magnetization during reversal ( stoner - wohlfarth particles @xcite ) .",
    "this approximation is valid if the island size is well below the domain wall width @xmath109 of a bulk ferromagnet @xcite , yielding an upper limit for the island size within our calculations . for larger sizes a noncollinear island magnetization has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ model ] the present model with nonuniform island interactions should not be applied for a smooth ferromagnetic film .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that our approach is also suited for the investigation of thicker films with a considerable surface roughness .",
    "also other thin film magnetic quantities will be affected strongly by an irregular nanostructure and the corresponding large magnetic relaxation times .",
    "for instance , the remanent magnetization as measured e.g. by moke , and the magnetization reversal by an applied magnetic field may depend considerably on the nonuniform atomic structure @xcite .",
    "since in near future magnetic nanostructured systems with a defined lateral structure will be prepared in a more and more controlled manner @xcite , the corresponding magnetic properties can be calculated for these atomic structures .",
    "vice versa , information about the atomic morphology can be obtained by analysing the magnetic properties .",
    "some remarks concerning the improvement of our present model study are in order .",
    "first , we will not only consider the two directions @xmath110 of the magnetic islands , but will allow for a continuous rotation of the magnetization .",
    "this will result in particular in a noncollinear magnetic arrangement of the island ensemble .",
    "the formation of larger magnetic domains may be facilitated , resulting in a faster magnetic relaxation .",
    "secondly , the magnetic dipole coupling will be included in our model , leading possibly to an even more complex magnetic structure .",
    "thirdly , we will calculate explicitely the relaxational behavior of the magnetization for different coverages and temperatures of a nanostructured thin film . from an analysis of the temporal behavior",
    "the relaxation times can be extracted .",
    "generally , also the growth velocity will affect the domain structure : for small velocities the islands have more time to align themselves and to create larger domains or a single - domain state .",
    "on the other hand , for a fast growth the islands become too fast too big to overcome the energy barriers , and the resulting domains are expected to be smaller @xcite .",
    "an applied magnetic field will support the formation of a single - domain state .",
    "also , we will calculate the susceptibility in response to a magnetic field , which will yield additional informations for the interplay between the atomic and the magnetic structure of growing films .",
    "furthermore , the temperature dependence of the atomic growth can be included by applying appropriate growth mode parameters . in the present study",
    "we have used the same growth mode for all temperatures in order to concentrate solely on the temperature dependence of the magnetic properties .",
    "finally , we will improve our kmc method by allowing for simultaneous flips of connected islands ( cluster - spin - flip algorithm @xcite ) .",
    "the consideration of such correlated jumps will yield a more realistic relaxational behavior .",
