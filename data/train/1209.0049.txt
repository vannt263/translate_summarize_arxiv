    "the crossover between the bcs and bec limits has been much explored@xcite .",
    "if real space pairing on small length scales is favorable energetically , a natural question to ask is why more than two fermions do not bind together .",
    "indeed , the competition of such  phase separation \" with superconductivity was a central theme of investigation in early studies of hamiltonians like the two dimensional fermion hubbard @xcite and @xmath4-@xmath5 @xcite models in the context of cuprate superconductors , which have short coherence length .",
    "upon doping away from one particle per site , a spatial division into half - filled af regions and areas where the hole concentration is high occurs . the tendency to phase separation",
    "was found to be especially great in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model , and somewhat less so in the hubbard model .",
    "roughly speaking , for small hole doping in the strong coupling limit such phase separation can be envisioned to arise because it minimizes the energy by preserving the largest number of antiferromagnetic bonds . on the other hand , when @xmath6 and the amount of holes is large , phase separation was shown to occur as to minimize the doped hole kinetic energy @xcite .    a compromise between complete phase separation into distinct two dimensional regions , and spatial homogeneity which would be favored by longer range coulomb interactions , @xcite is the possibility that the doped particles form quasi - one dimensional patterns in which hole - rich and hole - poor regions alternate .",
    "magnetic domain lines were observed in inhomogeneous hartree - fock studies very early in the history of cuprate superconductivity . ` charge domain lines '",
    "were first reported in a multi - band model which included both the copper @xmath1 and oxygen @xmath7 orbitals @xcite , and subsequently in the single band hubbard hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "such striped patterns have also been observed experimentally@xcite . in la@xmath8nd@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11",

    "away from @xmath12 domain wall ordering is weaker , with coexisting superconductivity .",
    "the relation between pairing and stripes is still controversial .",
    "the formation of charge stripe - order is related to an increase in the resistance perpendicular to the cuo planes , frustrating the formation of bulk superconductivity , as denoted by a sharp decrease of the critical temperature@xcite , @xmath13 , resulting in values as low as @xmath14  k. as stripes are perpendicularly stacked in each successive cuo plane , if the josephson coupling between stripes in the same plane is negative the coupling between stripes in different planes is destroyed @xcite .    in labacuo ,",
    "on the other hand , angle - resolved spectroscopy and transport measurements suggest a positive correlation between 2d pairing and stripes @xcite .",
    "there is an order of magnitude drop @xcite in the in - plane resistivity , @xmath15 , when the spin order occurs at @xmath16  k. furthermore , there are indications of true 2d superconductivity for @xmath17  k when @xmath15 goes to 0 @xcite .",
    "a recent exciting development is the direct evidence of stripes in yba@xmath0cu@xmath18o@xmath19 .",

    "zero - field diffraction with resonant soft @xcite and hard @xcite x - ray scattering , observed incommensurate charge order with a period around 3.2 lattice spacings .",
    "these experiments seem to indicate that stripes are an intrinsic phenomena in the cuprates , and that at least incipient charge ordering can be seen even in compounds with larger critical temperatures .    this has led to a large set of theoretical studies of charge ordered patterns to refine and improve upon the initial mean field treatment @xcite . given the complexity of the question of superconductivity even in the homogeneous model , it is not surprising that the details of the interplay with stripe formation should be challenging .    a recent calculation within the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca)@xcite provided detailed information concerning pairing correlations amidst static stripes , and revealed a rich competition between an enhancement of the pairing interaction and a suppression of the noninteracting susceptibility .",
    "the latter effect occurs as a consequence of the formation of mott regions away from the stripes , and a resulting suppression of quasiparticle weight .",
    "the two effects combine to give a non - monotonic evolution of the transition temperature with the stripe modulation strength .    in this paper",
    "we undertake determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) studies of stripe formation in the two dimensional hubbard model .",
    "the dqmc method complements the dca approach , working in real space rather than momentum space .",
    "it is possible to study somewhat larger clusters with dqmc , with , however , an off - setting greater restriction to the accessible temperatures .",
    "the key results of our work are an enhancement of antiferromagnetic order by charge modulation , and a @xmath2-phase shift above a critical threshold of the stripe potential . accompanying",
    "this larger magnetic order is a stronger signal of @xmath1-wave pairing in the associated superconducting vertex , although we are not able to lower the temperature enough to cross below the transition temperature .",
    "we study a two dimensional repulsive hubbard hamiltonian in which stripes are introduced externally via a raised site energy @xmath20 on a set of rows of period @xmath21 , @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the intersite fermion hopping between near neighbor sites @xmath24 on a square lattice , @xmath25 is an onsite repulsion , @xmath26 is a global chemical potential , and @xmath20 is an additional on - site energy imposed on a set of rows @xmath27 with @xmath28 . when @xmath29 this choice produces the spin and charge patterns postulated based on neutron scattering studies @xcite and shown to arise in density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) studies on the @xmath4-@xmath5 hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian does not , of course , address the issue of _ spontaneous _ stripe formation in a translationally invariant system , nor does it acknowledge the tendency of charge domain walls to fluctuate .",
    "nevertheless it allows us to examine the nature of spin and pairing correlations in the presence of a set of pre - formed lines of reduced charge density , and is an appropriate approximate model in the limit where the energy scale of stripe formation is considerably greater than that of pairing .",
    "most of our results will be for 16x16 lattices with @xmath29 , so that each stripe ( row with @xmath20 term active , blue filled circles in fig .  [ stripesketch ] )",
    "is separated by three rows where the @xmath20 term is not present ( empty circles in fig .",
    "[ stripesketch ] ) .",
    "the entire 16x16 site system accomodates four stripes for this @xmath29 case .",
    "we will also analyze finite size effects and present a smaller amount of data for pairing correlations at other periodicities @xmath21 .",
    "most of our results will be for a total density @xmath30 averaged over the entire lattice .",
    "this value was chosen because it allows for the exploration of a broad range of densities on the stripe and between stripes , and also because certain experimentally observed characteristics of the striped phase , such as the ` @xmath2 phase shift ' of the spin correlations when traversing a stripe , are absent at some other fillings .    in this @xmath29 case",
    ", we expect the charge order to be modulated along the y direction with the same period four , and the spin order has a period twice as large as a result of the ` @xmath2-phase shift ' ( see below ) , also observed in experiments .",
    "therefore , x - ray and neutron diffraction experiments are expected to show peaks at @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath33 is doping dependent in the la@xmath34ba@xmath10cuo@xmath11 family @xcite and is assumed to be 1/8 for doping higher than 0.125@xcite in agreement with the stripe sketch in fig .",
    "[ stripesketch ] .",
    "some experiments , however , displayed incommensurate charge stripes with @xmath33 smaller than expected @xcite .",
    "our methodology is determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the quartic interaction term is replaced by a coupling of the local @xmath35 component of spin to an auxiliary field@xcite .",
    "the fermion degrees of freedom are integrated out analytically , leaving a monte carlo over the auxiliary field . in the process of eliminating the interaction term",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath36 is discretized .",
    "we choose the discretization mesh @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting trotter errors are typically only a few percent , and their elimination is of consequence only if subtle changes in short range correlation functions are of interest @xcite . in dqmc ,",
    "the trotter errors are typically smaller than accessible statistical errors on long range spin , charge and pairing correlations at the lowest temperatures .",
    "the stripe potential @xmath20 breaks particle - hole symmetry so that there is a sign problem@xcite for all fillings .",
    "thus we can not obtain ground state properties as can be accessed , for example , in the half - filled homogeneous system or the attractive hubbard hamiltonian at any filling . a contour plot of the sign for @xmath30 and @xmath38 for a 16x16 lattice , is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the sign problem is no worse than in the doped , homogeneous case where one can , already discern significant trends concerning the superconducting correlations @xcite .",
    "we will show results for the spin and ( d - wave ) pair correlations , @xmath39 the quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 do not have complete translation invariance owing to the presence of the stripes .",
    "they will depend on the row index @xmath42 , for example whether mod@xmath43 so the row has a reduced density , or , for mod@xmath44 on the distance from the reduced density stripe .    in a phase with long range spin or pairing order , the appropriate correlation function would approach a constant value asymptotically as @xmath45 . indeed , precisely this is seen in the ground state of the half - filled hubbard model which has long range anti - ferromagnetic order@xcite , and the attractive hubbard model at a range of fillings@xcite .",
    "it is still an open issue whether @xmath46 is nonzero at long distances when the homogeneous hubbard model is doped away from half - filling , because the sign problem prevents attaining the ground state in the doped case .",
    "given this limitation on the simulations , it is important to develop methods which extract the maximal useful information about the tendency to order at temperatures above the putative superconducting phase transition . to this end , one introduces a somewhat more sensitive measure of pairing by considering the pair - field susceptibility @xmath47 and its associated vertex . to define @xmath47 we first extend the definition of the equal time pair correlation function @xmath46 to allow the insertion and removal of the cooper pair to be separated in imaginary time .",
    "@xmath47 is the sum over all spatial sites @xmath48 and integral over all imaginary time @xmath49 separations of @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51    we also define the uncorrelated pair field susceptibility @xmath52 which instead computes the expectation values of pairs of operators _ prior _ to taking the product , with expressions like @xmath53 which appear in evaluating the @xmath47 in eq .",
    "[ pairsusc ] being replaced by @xmath54 .    @xmath47 includes both the renormalization of the propagation of the individual fermions as well as the interaction vertex between them , whereas @xmath52 includes only the former effect .",
    "in short , in dqmc , the averaging over the hubbard - stratonovich field replaces the interaction with the one body potential by the original electron - electron interactions , so that the order of averaging and multiplying the operators can be used to control which many body effects are included .    by evaluating",
    "both @xmath47 and @xmath52 we are able to extract @xcite the interaction vertex @xmath55 , @xmath56 if @xmath57 , the associated pairing interaction is attractive . in fact , rewriting eq .",

    "this is the analog of the familiar stoner criterion @xmath60 which arises from the random phase approximation expression @xmath61 for the interacting magnetic susceptibility @xmath62 in terms of the noninteracting @xmath63 .",
    "we will discuss this criterion in more detail in the coming sections .",
    "when the total density , averaged over the entire lattice , is fixed , the densities on and in - between the stripes depend on @xmath20 is shown in fig .",
    "[ rhov0insideandoutsidestripes ] for @xmath30 and @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 corresponds to the homogeneous lattice , and the stripe and interstripe densities are equal there . as @xmath20 increases",
    ", charge is driven off the stripes until , ultimately , for @xmath66 , the stripes are nearly empty .",
    "the fermions flow into the interstripe regions .",
    "their density rises , going through half - filling at @xmath67 , and asymptotically increasing to a bit over unity for large @xmath20 for @xmath30 .",
    "if the average density on the entire lattice were @xmath68 then , for @xmath29 , the interstripe regions would be precisely half - filled when the stripes are completely empty . for @xmath64",

    "[ spinspinn16u4 ] the spin - spin correlation @xmath71 is given down the center of the interstripe region ( i.e.  parallel to the stripes , see arrows in the inset ) , at @xmath30 for @xmath72 ( a ) and @xmath73 ( b ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ rhov0insideandoutsidestripes ] these values correspond to densities slightly below and slightly above half - filling respectively . despite the doping",

    "thus the results of figs .",
    "[ spinspinn16u4 ] and [ spinspinv0_0 ] suggest that domain formation is a prerequisite for any superconductivity which is postulated to arise from robust magnetism at this density .",

    "[ spinspinn16u4 ] and [ spinspinv0_0 ] , but for @xmath64 .",
    "although spin - spin correlations are slightly higher at @xmath75 , where the interstripe density is close to one , antiferromagnetic correlations are very short ranged for all @xmath20 .    if the lattice is traversed perpendicular to the stripes , we expect the spin correlations to be significantly reduced : the low density on the stripes does not support a very large moment . in fig .",
    "[ spincorrelation_vo ] we show @xmath76 , corresponding to a pair of sites on a line parallel to the @xmath77 axis and traversing a stripe ( see inset for a sketch ) .",
    "the scale of @xmath78 is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath79 , as suggested should be the case by the preceding argument .",
    "apart from the size of the correlation , there is another feature of crucial interest . for @xmath30 and small @xmath20 ,",
    "i.e.  close to the homogeneous limit , the spin correlation two sites away @xmath76 is positive , as expected for an antiferromagnet .",
    "however for @xmath80 , the sign flips and @xmath76 becomes negative .",
    "this effect is strongly reduced for @xmath64 , where the negative values of @xmath76 are smaller in magnitude than those for @xmath30 and only occur for @xmath81 .",
    "this ` @xmath2-phase shift ' is a prominent experimental feature of stripe physics in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "these results show that this shift in the sublattice order across a stripe is also a characteristic of the doped 2d fermion hubbard model , at least in the case considered here in which the stripes are created through an externally imposed potential .",
    "we turn now to the pairing correlations .",
    "figure [ dwavealongi ] shows the d - wave pairing correlation function along a stripe .",
    "as we will see below , the lowest temperatures achieved are well above the superconducting transition and therefore the superconducting correlations are short - ranged .",
    "[ dwavealong ] shows the pairing correlations between two neighboring sites within a stripe as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "it is clear that the presence of stripes enhances pairing , and it is interesting to note that for both @xmath30 and @xmath64 , @xmath46 stabilizes for @xmath20 close to the value for which the ` @xmath2 phase shift ' takes place , namely @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "figure [ n16_gammapdnv ] shows the key result of this paper . as charge domains are introduced into the square lattice hubbard model , the @xmath1-wave pairing vertex becomes considerably more attractive .",
    "indeed , not only is its magnitude increased by a factor of three relative to the homogeneous system , the temperature evolution becomes increasingly steep .",
    "as in all existing dqmc studies of the repulsive hubbard hamiltonian , the sign problem prevents accessing low enough temperatures to establish a critical @xmath13 where @xmath84 , if such a superconducting transition does indeed occur in this model .",
    "nevertheless , the results figure [ n16_gammapdnv ] are suggestive that charge domains considerably enhance the @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "we can study this same data as a function of @xmath20 at constant temperature .",
    "figure [ betaall ] shows results for our canonical parameters , 16x16 lattices , @xmath38 and @xmath30 .",
    "we find that the pairing vertex becomes more and more robust with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "this is not completely intuitive .",
    "one might expect that a maximum pairing would occur for @xmath67 where , according to fig .",
    "[ rhov0insideandoutsidestripes ] , the inter - stripe regions are most close to half - filling and hence antiferromagnetic correlations are most strong .",
    "alternately , as @xmath20 becomes very large the particle density within the stripes drops to zero .",
    "if the physical picture is that of pairing of mobile carriers in the doped region driven by spin correlations in the half - filled domains , at large @xmath20 the density of these carriers becomes small , and one would again expect @xmath85 to turn over .",
    "recent dca calculations@xcite indeed reveal an initial enhancement of pairing with the introduction of stripes , followed by a fall - off as the above physical arguments suggest .",
    "however , this non - monotonicity is observed only at very low temperatures @xmath86 quite close to @xmath13 . for higher @xmath74 , closer to the range studied here ,",
    "there is no sign of the @xmath1-wave eigenvalue coming down at large @xmath20 .",
    "although the lower temperature scales is the most likely explanation for the dca non - monotonicity , it is also possible that , in the work presented here , the decline of pairing correlations in the doped stripes is compensated by an increase in the interstripe domains , which are shifted away from half - filling at large @xmath20 .",
    "it seems clear that for large @xmath20 and density @xmath87 where the interstripe regions are precisely half filled , the pairing signal would be forced to be small , and hence that a turnover such as is seen in dca calculations should occur .",
    "the physics of the half - filled homogeneous hubbard model on a square lattice is believed not to be highly sensitive to the interaction strength @xmath25 .",
    "that is , the ground state is an antiferromagnetic insulator for all @xmath25 , although the precise nature of the phase evolves from a weak coupling regime described by spin density wave physics to a strong coupling mott insulator . in order to assess",
    "whether the enhancement of @xmath1 wave pairing due to striped formation is similarly generic to different @xmath25 or specific to @xmath38 , we show data for @xmath88 as a function of temperature @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ gammapdnvu6 ] for @xmath89 .",
    "the same basic evolution is observed as in fig .",
    "[ n16_gammapdnv ] , with the vertex being enhanced by @xmath20 both in magnitude and also in the steepness of its evolution as @xmath74 is lowered . a comparison of the data ranges of figs .",
    "[ n16_gammapdnv ] and [ gammapdnvu6 ] also reveals some of the limitations of dqmc .",
    "as @xmath25 gets larger the sign problem grows , as do the fluctuations ( error bars ) . for @xmath89",
    "the lowest accessible temperature is @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , compared to @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) at @xmath38 .",
    "smaller interaction strengths , e.g.  @xmath94 , can readily be simulated , but tend to harbor large finite size effects which are the remnants of high degeneracies in the noninteracting energy levels on a square lattice .",
    "we next explore a different lattice periodicity , @xmath95 .",
    "unlike the case of different interaction strengths , where the qualitative physics remains unchanged , @xmath95 behaves in a very different manner from @xmath29 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ gammapdnv_1 - 1 ] . in this case",
    ", increasing @xmath20 reduces the magnitude of @xmath96 , and by the time @xmath75 the vertex has even changed sign and become repulsive .",
    "it should be noted that because for @xmath95 there are fewer stripes which do not feel the @xmath20 potential to absorb the fermions as @xmath20 increases , their density is increased above @xmath97 , where af correlations are most evident , far more easily than in the @xmath29 case shown in fig .",
    "[ rhov0insideandoutsidestripes ] .",
    "this is the probable cause for the decrease in @xmath1 wave pairing correlations .",
    "our final check of the robustness of the enhancement of pairing by stripes is to explore a different density @xmath64 , which is optimal for pairing in the absence of stripes .",

    "the monotonically decreasing behavior of the energy with @xmath20 , suggests that a maximization of charge imbalance is favored .",
    "when we study the effect of the periodicity of the stripes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ totalenergystripes ] on a 12x12 lattice , we see that @xmath99 have much lower energies , suggesting their formation might be favored .",
    "these periodicities have densities on the lines which are not subject to the additional potential @xmath20 relatively close to half - filling , and hence they have the largest antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the external imposition of stripes via the introduction of a linear pattern of reduced chemical potential has been shown to result in a significant enhancement of the @xmath1-wave pairing vertex of the two dimensional hubbard hamiltonian . when the overall density and periodicity of the stripes are such that the density in the interstripe region is close to one , antiferromagnetic correlations are also made larger , and exhibit a @xmath2-phase shift across the stripes .",
    "both the @xmath2-phase shift and the growth in the superconducting response occur only when the charge inhomogeneity is sufficiently large , specifically when the additional inhomogeneous site potential @xmath20 exceeds roughly three times the hopping .",

    "there are suggestions@xcite that the motion of charge / spin domain walls is important to the enhancement of superconductivity , whereas frozen stripes , such as created by nd doping , is inimical to pairing .",
    "the studies in the present paper , as well as the earlier dca work of maier _ etal _ @xcite indicate that the situation may not be quite so straightforward and that , in fact , the stripes produced by an external potential might also be able to enhance superconductivity .",
    "we have motivated our form for the externally imposed stripe potential at @xmath29 as producing the charge / spin patterns suggested by neutron scattering @xcite and dmrg calculations @xcite .",

    "<S> we attribute this enhancement to an increase in antiferromagnetic order which is caused by the appearance of more nearly half - filled regions when the doped holes are confined to the stripes . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe a @xmath2-phase shift in the magnetic order . </S>"
