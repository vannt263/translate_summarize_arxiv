    "[ nr_acc ] shows the accuracy of the n - r iterative method .",
    "there are several noteworthy features .",
    "first is the presence of a sizable region corresponding to @xmath140 within which accuracy is generally significantly better than 10@xmath67 .",
    "second is that n - r iteration is unreliable due to sporadic failures for increasing lorentz factors until accuracy becomes unacceptable or the code fails outright due to divide by zero ( see  [ sfix ] ) or non - convergence within a reasonable number of iterations .",
    "in addition , though n - r iteration has been widely established as the primitives recovery method of choice for flows with lorentz factors less than order 10@xmath0 , we found that for a subset of parameters , corresponding to @xmath33 , our n - r algorithm suffered an unacceptable degradation in accuracy .",
    "the key to this problem lies in the how the flow velocity ( @xmath4 ) is initially estimated for the first iterative cycle as follows :    1 .",
    "the established approach @xcite is to bracket @xmath4 with + v_max & = & min(1,y+ ) , + v_min & = & , where @xmath155 and @xmath156 is derived by taking the ultra - relativistic limit ( i.e. @xmath150 ) 2 .",

    "this method fails due to selection of the incorrect root when the roots converge .",
    "thus , we make a simpler initial estimate of @xmath163 , which guarantees that @xmath164 is `` uphill '' from @xmath4 for all physical @xmath152 space and that n - r iteration converges on @xmath4 .",
    "[ hy_acc ] shows that our hybrid algorithm rest_frame is accurate to at least 10@xmath67 for all but a smattering of the highest lorentz factors .",
    "in fact , it is significantly more accurate over the majority of the physical portion of the @xmath152 plane .",
    "the space between the parallel lines represents the pwn input parameters discussed in the next section .",
    "we find that multiplying @xmath41 by @xmath165 and rewriting the new @xmath44 ( @xmath108 ) in terms of the new @xmath166 ( @xmath102 ) and new @xmath167 ( @xmath106 ) , e.g. @xmath168 , improves the accuracy somewhat , but does not entirely mitigate the problem .",
    "the issue of accuracy loss at large lorentz factors in 8-byte primitives algorithms is a known issue ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for which we know of no complete 8-byte solution . employing 16-byte arithmetic provides spectacular accuracy , but introduces an unacceptable increase in run time ( see @xmath10[timing ] ) .",
    "the issue of what constitutes an acceptable error in the calculated lorentz factor is decided by the fact that a fractional error in @xmath40 translates to the same fractional error in @xmath3 and @xmath2 which are needed to calculate the wave speeds that form the basis of the numerical , hydrodynamic technique , a godunov scheme @xcite which approximates the solution to the local riemann problem by employing an estimate of the wave speeds .",
    "we do not know a priori how accurate this estimate needs to be , and so procede with 8-byte simulations of pulsar winds with the expectation of using shock - tube tests @xcite to validate the accuracy of the computation of well - defined flow structures as we approach the highest lorentz factors .",
    "it is also noteworthy that while @xmath40 = 10@xmath1 is the canonical bulk lorentz factor for pulsar winds , @xmath40 = 10@xmath169 and 10@xmath170 are still in the ultra - relativistic regime , and it may very well prove to be that these lorentz factors are high enough to elucidate the general ultra - relativistic , hydrodynamic features of such a system .",
    "the hybrid algorithm achieves accuracies of at least 10@xmath171 for @xmath172 , which is safely in the acceptable accuracy regime .",
    "at the end of a massive star s life , the collapse of its core to a compact object , i.e. a neutron star or black hole , drives a shockwave into its outer layers , thereby heating and ejecting them into the interstellar medium ( ism ) in a supernova ( sn ) explosion .",
    "subsequently , the shockwave overtakes the ejecta , expanding into the ism , and forming a supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "typically , a sn releases 10@xmath173 erg of mechanical energy that drives expansion of the snr , sweeping up ism material , heating it to x - ray temperatures and infusing it with fusion products beyond lithium .    in a subclass of snrs , for progenitor masses between 10 and 25 solar masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the compact object formed in the sn explosion is a rapidly - spinning , highly - magnetized neutron star surrounded by a magnetosphere of charged particles .",
    "the combination of the rotation and the magnetic field gives rise to extremely powerful electric fields that accelerate charged particles to high velocities .",
    "the magnetic field interacts with the charged particles resulting in the spin - down of the neutron star , and the release of spin - down energy .",
    "a relatively small fraction of this energy is converted into beamed emission , manifest as an apparent pulse if the neutron star s rotation sweeps the beam across the earth , leading to the designation `` pulsar '' .",
    "the bulk of the spin - down energy is converted into a pulsar wind @xcite which is terminated at a strong shock , downstream of which the flow is indistinguishable from being spherically symmetric ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the wind particles interact with the magnetic field causing them to emit synchrotron radiation , forming a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "the crab nebula , formed in the sn explosion of 1054 ce , is the canonical object of this type . the crab exhibits pulsations from the radio , all the way up to x - rays , and is a prodigious source of @xmath40-rays .",
    "the wind in the immediate vicinity of the pulsar is a diffuse , relativistic gas unlikely to be directly observable .",
    "however , the classic structure of forward and reverse shocks separated by a contact surface @xcite arises from the wind interaction with the snr or ism .",
    "a probe of this interaction is provided by optical emission from the swept - up ambient ism , thermal x - ray emission from the snr and/or the shocked ism , and x - ray synchrotron emission from the shocked wind .",
    "furthermore , the high space velocity that is typical of pulsars @xcite implies an asymmetric ram pressure on the pulsar wind from the denser ambient medium .",
    "the details of the morphology and of the distribution of the density , pressure , and velocity within the pwn depends upon the density , speed , momentum , and energy flux of the pulsar wind .",
    "thus , comparison of pwn simulations with observational data can provide an unparalleled method for investigating pulsar winds and , hence , how the surrounding medium taps the rotational energy of the pulsar .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pioneered the basic model of pwne ; a model further developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite are excellent reviews on observational and theoretical studies of pwne , respectively . for a number of reasons ,",
    "a detailed , quantitative study of pwne is now particularly timely .",
    "first , there is a cornucopia of high - quality data from space - born observatories such as the @xmath174 x - ray observatory and xmm - newton .",
    "second , the total energy radiated by pwne accounts for only a small fraction of the spin - down energy , leaving a large energy reservoir available for interaction with the snr and acceleration of ions , the partitioning of which is not well understood .",
    "efforts to model pwne span three decades ( with seminal papers * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the case for a non - isotropic pulsar wind energy flux has long been made @xcite , it has only been recently that a theoretical explanation of the mechanism behind the jet / torus structure interior to the termination shock has been put forward , and that the predictions of @xcite have been confirmed @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite highlighted that a detailed description has been made possible by the increase in the efficiency and robustness of relativistic , numerical mhd codes stemming from the work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite indicate that where jet formation in pwne takes place is tied to where the magnetic field attains equipartition , at which point the magnetic filed can no longer be compressed .",
    "if this happens close to the termination shock , then , due to the mildly relativistic nature of the post - shock flow , hoop stresses can become efficient and most of the flow is diverted back toward the axis and collimated .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetization is key : if it is too small , the equipartition is reached outside the nebula , hoop stresses remain inefficient , and no collimation is produced .",
    "other modeling , for example , that presented herein , is concerned with the _ global _ structure of pwne . the enormous acceleration of the wind at the termination shock smears out asymmetries leaving an essentially spherically symmetric shocked flow to produce large scale pwn features .",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite are two recent examples of simulations addressing the structures that arise in bow - shock pwne ( see below ) .",
    "@xcite were the first to apply a fully - relativistic mhd code @xcite , and , for an axisymmetric geometry , obtained a relativistic backflow behind the pulsar , as predicted by @xcite for psr1929 + 10 .",
    "however , the wind lorentz factor and pulsar velocity were 10 and 9000 km s@xmath175 , respectively , which are far from the typical values of 10@xmath1 and 500 km s@xmath175 ( indeed , the guitar pulsar , the fastest known , has a transverse velocity of @xmath1191700 km s@xmath175 ) .",
    "in addition , the paper does not address the `` bubble '' in the guitar ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : guitar ] ) . @xcite performed _",
    "non_-relativistic , hydrodynamic simulations with a relaxation to cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the full 3-d flash code @xcite was employed and an anisotropic pulsar wind , cooling of the shocked ism , ism density gradients , and ism walls were considered . while the authors employed a realistic pulsar velocity of 400 km s@xmath175 , the non - relativistic nature of the simulations limited the lorentz factor to order unity . in this section , we present fully - relativistic , axisymmetric , hydrodynamic simulations of bow - shock pwne for a realistic pulsar velocity and wind lorentz factor . in particular ,",
    "we address the origin of relativistic backflows leading to a persistent nebular bubble .",
    "the evolution of pwne can be broken into four broad phases : 1 ) free - expansion , 2 ) snr reverse shock interaction , 3 ) expansion inside a sedov snr , and 4 ) bow shock formation ( for a detailed discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this work",
    ", we investigate the last stage of evolution .",
    "the time it takes for the pulsar to cross the snr was obtained by @xcite : t_cr = 1.410 ^ 4()^1/3()^-5/3()^-1/3 , where @xmath176 is the velocity of the pulsar .",
    "once the pwn - snr system has evolved to the sedov - taylor stage , the time elapsed is sufficiently large that is possible for the pulsar to have reached the edge of the nebula , or even beyond @xcite .",
    "thus , the pulsar escapes its original wind bubble , leaving behind a `` relic '' pwn , and traverses the snr while inflating a new pwn . as the pulsar moves away from the center of the remnant , the sound speed decreases .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite calculated the mach number of the pulsar , @xmath177 , and found that @xmath177 exceeds unity after a time @xmath178 , at which point the pulsar has travelled a distance @xmath179 , and the nebula is deformed into a bow shock .",
    "the condition on the pulsar velocity for this transition to occur while the remnant is in the sedov - taylor phase is given by ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) : v_psr 325()^1/17()^2/17kms^-1 , a relation showing a strikingly weak dependence on the physical parameters .",
    "a significant fraction ( 3040% depending on the velocity distribution model ) of the pulsars compiled by @xcite satisfy this condition .",
    "@xcite showed that once the pulsar reaches the edge of the remnant , its mach number is @xmath180 .",
    "subsequently , the pulsar moves through the ism where its velocity corresponds to a hypersonic mach number typically on the order of 10@xmath0 .",
    "the most famous example of a pwn in this stage of evolution is the guitar nebula ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : sim - evo ] shows a series of pressure maps comprising a time development sequence for the simulation depicted in fig .",
    "the sequence clearly indicates that once the pulsar crosses the boundary of the initially spherical nebula , an inflection point develops along the leading edge at approximately 45@xmath205 from the axis as measured from w to n to the inflow direction to having it at 90@xmath205 . ] .",
    "the pressure waves are intensified and propagate to the axis and reflect , leading to the formation of a relativistic backflow harboring internal shockwaves reminiscent of shock diamonds .",
    "the fact that the backflow does not develop until after the inflection point supports this picture .",
    "the internal shockwaves , in turn , thermalize energy , allowing the flow to expand and inflate the trailing spherical bubble .",
    "as the bubble inflates , it `` pinches '' the inflection point enhancing the cuspy shape , maintaining the pressure - wave influx that sets up the energy - thermalizing backflow responsible for inflating the bubble .",
    "such a feedback cycle is relevent to the guitar nebula even though the pulsar was not born at the center of the trailing bubble  given its proper motion , the pulsar moves a distance corresponding to the entire nebula in less than 500 yr @xcite , a time orders of magnitude too short for the age of a pulsar powering a bow - shock nebula  because it explains how the bubble persists .",
    "such a scenario is analogous to the formation of structure in relativistic galactic jets , where the evolution is driven by kelvin - helmholtz modes long the contact surface that separates the shocked ambient medium from the shocked jet material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution of the guitar - like shape is rather sensitive to the choice of parameters . as tab .  [",
    "tab : it - inf ] shows , the appearance of the inflection point marking the onset of the formation of the `` neck '' of the guitar takes a significantly larger number of computational iterations as the ambient - flow velocity decreases .",
    "this is expected as the asymmetry of the nebula should evolve more slowly in this scenario : a decreased ambient - flow velocity is equivalent to a lower pulsar space motion and so it takes more time for the pulsar to reach the nebula boundary thereby delaying the formation of the inflection point .",
    "if the inflection point is not induced while the expanding nebula is small enough such that the ensuing neck is of significant scale , then no guitar - like structure will be apparent .",
    "if a pulsar velocity of 1500 km  s@xmath175 , 1250 km  s@xmath175 , or 1000 km  s@xmath175 is required for observable guitar - like morphology to arise , then the velocity distribution of @xcite implies that @xmath2065% , 7 - 8% , or @xmath11915% of radio pulsars , respectively , have the possibility of developing such features depending on the nature of their ambient environment .",

    "<S> however , these two conditions are violated for a host of interesting scenarios , including , for example , heavy ion collision systems @xcite , relativistic laser systems @xcite , and many from astrophysics ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , that call for a fully relativistic , hydrodynamic ( rhd ) treatment . </S>",
    "<S> the methods of solution of classical hydrodynamic problems have been successfully adapted to those of a rhd nature , albeit giving rise to significant complication ; in particular , the physical quantities of a hydrodynamic flow ( the rest - frame mass density , @xmath2 , pressure , @xmath3 , and velocity , @xmath4 ) are coupled to the conserved quantities ( the laboratory - frame mass density , @xmath5 , momentum density , @xmath6 , and energy density , @xmath7 ) via the lorentz transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that modern rhd codes typically evolve the conserved quantities necessitates the recovery of the physical quantities ( often referred to as the `` primitive variables '' ) from the conserved quantities in order to obtain the flow velocity . </S>",

    "<S> we started with a module from an existing srhd code used to simulate flows with @xmath950 as described in @xcite . admitting flows with such ultra - relativistic lorentz factors as 10@xmath1 required significant refinement to the method used in the existing code to calculate the flow velocity from the conserved quantities . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , such extreme lorentz factors lead to severe numerical problems such as effectively dividing by zero and subtractive cancellation . in @xmath10[hydro ] , we discuss the formalism of recovering the primitives within the context of the euler equations . in @xmath10[sfix ] , we elucidate the details of the refinement to this formalism necessitated by ultra - relativistic flows . </S>",

    "<S> we discuss our results and conclusions in @xmath10[sec : dis ] and @xmath10[sec : conc ] , respectively .    in general </S>",
    "<S> , recovering the primitives from the conserved quantities reduces to solving a quartic equation , @xmath11 , for the flow velocity in terms of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> implementation typically involves a numerical root finder to recover the velocity via newton - raphson iteration which is very efficient and provides robustness because it is straightforward to ensure that the computed velocity is always less than the speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> this is a powerful method that is independent of dimensionality and symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the latter point follows directly from the fact that symmetry is manifest only as a source term in the euler equations and does not enter into the derivation of @xmath12 ( see the axisymmetric example below ) . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , n - r iteration can be so efficient that it is more desirable to use this method than it is to calculate the roots of the quartic analytically ( see @xmath10[timing ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the lorentz factor of the flow increases , the roots move progressively closer together and the minimum in @xmath12 approaches zero . eventually , the minimum equals zero to machine accuracy which causes @xmath34 to machine accuracy resulting in a divide by zero and the newton - raphson method fails ( see fig .  </S>",
