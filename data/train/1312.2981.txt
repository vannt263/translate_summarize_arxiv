    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite introduced a general form of quantum measurement , known as a weak measurement . in weak measurements , </S>",
    "<S> information is gained by weakly probing the system , while approximately preserving its initial state . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty in each measurement is large due to the weak perturbative nature of the information extraction ; however , this is generally overcome by averaging over a large number of identically prepared states . </S>",
    "<S> the process of post - selecting the prepared system makes weak measurements interesting . under certain conditions </S>",
    "<S> the outcome , which is called a weak value ( wv ) , is not an eigenvalue of the measurement operator . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , wvs can even exceed the eigenvalue range of a typical strong or projective measurement and in general are complex . </S>",
    "<S> these features have allowed a wide range of applicability in classical and quantum contexts . </S>",
    "<S> for example , they have resulted in the measurement via amplification of small transverse  @xcite and longitudinal  @xcite shifts , the direct measurement of the quantum wave function  @xcite , the development of tomographic techniques  @xcite , the amplification of optical nonlinearities  @xcite , and the clarification of controversial debates in quantum physics  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been a strong impetus to employ weak - value amplification ( wva ) as an effective tool in metrology  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a wva protocol involves the preparation of an ensemble of particles with two independent degrees of freedom ( dof ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two dofs are then coupled by means of a weak perturbation and post - selected to collapse one of the dof , typically called the probe . due to the coupling existing between the probe and the other dof , called the pointer </S>",
    "<S> , the post - selection induces a shift in the linear position of the pointer which is proportional to the weakly induced perturbation and the wv . </S>",
    "<S> this has allowed the use of wva to estimate small quantities with sensitivities comparable to quantum - enhanced metrology  @xcite , due to the fact that the use of quantum protocols does not guarantee sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit , which is the limit for classical protocols  @xcite .    besides the extensive work on the estimation of longitudinal displacements  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , high sensitivity measurement of angular displacements has been another topic of interest . </S>",
    "<S> historically , inquiries regarding relativistic dynamics stimulated interest on the azimuthal dof @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable example is the sagnac effect . </S>",
    "<S> atomic versions of the sagnac interferometer have led to sensitive gyroscopes that permit a precise measurement of rotations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the use of light endowed with orbital angular momentum ( oam ) has motivated interest in new forms of rotations . as identified by allen _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , an optical beam with azimuthal phase dependence of the form @xmath0 carries oam , where @xmath1 is the azimuthal angle and @xmath2 is the oam value . </S>",
    "<S> these beams have been used for rotational control of microscopic systems @xcite , and exploration of effects such as the rotational doppler shift @xcite which has been recently used in techniques for detecting spinning objects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent efforts to increase the sensitivity in the measurement of angular rotations involve the generation of large values of oam  @xcite , quantum entanglement of high oam values  @xcite , or the use of n00n states in the oam bases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these protocols require complicated schemes to generate and measure photons in such exotic states . </S>",
    "<S> however , the concepts behind them constitute valuable resources not only for optical metrology , remote sensing , biological imaging or navigation systems  @xcite , but also for the understanding of light - matter interactions  @xcite .        in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we describe wva in the azimuthal dof and the processes that give rise to these effects . </S>",
    "<S> the first observation of these kinds of wvs suggests interesting physics from the fundamental and applied perspective . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the spin - orbit coupling in our experiment gives rise to an interesting optical effect in which the perturbation of polarization induces a shift in the angular position and oam spectrum of the pointer . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the real and the imaginary part of the wv for the polarization operator can be accessed by measuring the angular position and its conjugate variable of oam , respectively . using this new form of wvs based on spin - orbit coupling </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a scheme for the measurement of small rotations . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate an amplification in the measurement of angular rotations that is as large as 100 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of our scheme , namely lack of need for exotic quantum state of lights or extremely large values of oam , makes this technique potentially attractive for applications in optical metrology , remote sensing and optical manipulation of microscopic systems .        </S>",
    "<S> consider the experimental setup depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : expsetup ] . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme comprises three parts : state preparation , a weak perturbation , and post - selection . </S>",
    "<S> the state preparation involves the generation of a light beam with diagonal polarization and a well - defined spatial profile . </S>",
    "<S> we select the initial polarization state using a polarizer and a half - wave plate ( hwp ) ; this state will serve as a probe and can be described by the polarization qubit @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the preparation of the spatial mode or pointer consists of the generation of an angular mode ( ang ) @xmath4 , which is a gaussian - apodized angular slit of width @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is shaped by impressing amplitude and phase information onto the beam by means of modulation of the blaze parameters on a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , used together with a 4f optical system containing a spatial filter in the fourier plane  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages that pointer states carrying oam provide over gaussian pointer states have been studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the beam is injected into a sagnac interferometer , where the horizontally and vertically polarized components of the beam circulate in opposite directions . the dove prism ( dp ) </S>",
    "<S> is rotated by a small angle @xmath6 with respect to the plane of the interferometer , which causes the two counter - propagating beams to be rotated by an amount of @xmath7 in opposite directions . </S>",
    "<S> this setup enables a coupling between the polarization , marked by the two counter propagating beams , and the transverse azimuthal dof . in the next step we use two quarter - wave plates ( qwp ) and a hwp to induce a geometric phase between the two circulating beams in the interferometer , permitting the existence of complex wvs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the post - selection is carried out by setting the angle of a polarizer almost orthogonal with respect to the angle of the polarizer used in the pre - selection . at this stage , </S>",
    "<S> a full characterization of the complex wavefunction in the transverse angular basis and the conjugate basis of oam reveals information about the real and the imaginary part of the wv , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction in our experiment can be described by the spin - orbit interaction hamiltonian @xmath8 and a hamiltonian that describes the action of the wave plates @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the pauli operator defined by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the induced geometric phase . </S>",
    "<S> our state at the input of the interferometer has the following form @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction which occurs in the dp couples the two dofs as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 act as the generator of rotations and is proportional to the angular momentum operator projected along the optical axis @xmath18 , and @xmath19 equals @xmath20 . as demonstrated by eq . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the weak coupling creates entanglement between probe and pointer . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that since the probe and the pointer are different dofs of a single beam rather than separate systems or particles , then this is an example of classical entanglement and thus can be described classically  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because of this , most traditional weak measurement experiments , such as those described in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , are classically explainable . </S>",
    "<S> this also demonstrates what is required to perform a non - classical weak measurement experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen to use the mature language of weak measurement theory , since it provides a simpler description and the results readily apply to a wider range of phenomena including non - classical systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the post - selection is performed by projecting the perturbed state into @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is controlled by the polarizer . </S>",
    "<S> the post - selection collapses the polarization state of the probe and causes a shift in the angular position and the oam spectrum of the pointer that can be described as @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the complex wv given by @xmath25 @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> if the induced phase @xmath19 and polarizer selection angle @xmath28 are small , the wv can be approximated as @xcite @xmath29    the post - selected state described in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqn : psi_p ] shows a change in angle as @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath31 is real , which will be the case for @xmath32 , then this leads to the rotation of the pointer by the amount @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> however if @xmath31 is complex then @xmath33 where @xmath34 sets the amount of the pointer s rotation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the pointer experiences a shift in its oam spectrum that equals @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the angular representation of the spatial mode of the photons , and utilized the fourier relation between the conjugate pairs of azimuthal angle and angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the same results can be derived by using the commutation relation between angular position and oam operators , which is given by @xmath36=i\\hbar(1 - 2\\pi p(\\phi))$ ] where @xmath37 represents the angular probability at the boundary of the angle range  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the shift in the oam spectrum can be understood as a form of interaction between spin angular momentum ( sam ) and oam . </S>",
    "<S> this interesting optical effect is a consequence of the polarization - sensitive nature of the interactions in the interferometer , and should not be confused with the standard spin - orbit coupling in the vector beams where both the sam and oam are directed along the same axis @xcite .        in the experiment we use a 3 mw </S>",
    "<S> he - ne laser ( 632.8 nm ) which is coupled to a single - mode fiber ( smf ) and then expanded to a spot size of 1.8 cm . </S>",
    "<S> the central part of the beam homogeneously illuminates the display of the slm that has an active area of @xmath38 . due to the reflectance of the slm and the efficiency of the encoded diffractive grating on it , the power drops to 470 nw </S>",
    "<S> once an ang mode of width @xmath39 is generated . </S>",
    "<S> the dp in the sagnac interferometer is rotated by @xmath40 , this angle is determined by measuring a relative rotation of @xmath41 between two identical ang modes propagating in the opposite directions . </S>",
    "<S> the induced displacement @xmath42 , is chosen to be much smaller than the width of the ang mode , in order to guarantee the conditions for the weak perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the post - selection polarizer is set to an angle @xmath28 , with respect to the polarization state of the pre - selected state . for this part </S>",
    "<S> , we have set @xmath19 to zero .    </S>",
    "<S> since our interest is in the amplification of the weak - value , the angle @xmath28 is set to a small number . </S>",
    "<S> the post - selection polarizer forces the two ang modes to coherently interfere , producing another ang mode which is rotated due to the azimuthal gaussian intensity distribution impressed in the ang  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such rotation is proportional to the angular displacement @xmath42 and the real part of the wv @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> since the wv can take values larger than one , this scheme allows the amplification of small rotations . </S>",
    "<S> however , as @xmath43 is increased more photons are lost as shown for different post - selection angles ( pa ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : realwv]a  e . in order to detect this effect , </S>",
    "<S> a ccd camera is placed after the polarizer . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to measuring the expected value of the angular position in the state @xmath44 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : realwv]f  j , the measured power is in the range of 1030 nw , however these images were taken using long exposure times . as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : realwv ] , an aggressive post - selection leads to a larger rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the amplification factor ( amp ) is defined as the ratio between the angular position of the post - selected mode @xmath45 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this is equal to @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath47 and @xmath42 were determined by using centroid measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the amplification limit is given by the extinction ratio of the polarizer and the magnitude of the weak perturbation or the angle of post - selection . </S>",
    "<S> larger amplifications can be measured if the width of ang is increased and the post - selection angle is decreased .    the imaginary part of the wv can be determined by analyzing the shift of the oam spectrum of the ang . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen the rotation angle of the dp to be approximately @xmath48 and we have tried different angular widths for the input state . in order to allow @xmath49 to be nonzero , the phase @xmath19 must also be nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by inducing a geometric phase between the polarization states @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is created using three rotatable wave plates as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : expsetup ] . </S>",
    "<S> the angle of the qwps is set to @xmath52 and the hwp is rotated by a small angle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have set the hwp to an angle such that @xmath53 and tried several different post - selection angles for the polarizer . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of the oam spectrum associated with a beam can be done using a wide variety of techniques  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the oam using a series of projective measurements for various values of @xmath2 . using a similar procedure as was used for generating the angular slits , a hologram was impressed onto a slm and then a fourier transforming lens and a spatial filtering from a smf couples photons to an apd which allows measurement at single photon levels @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we summed the counts during a 0.2 second window and averaged it for 30 measurements for each projection over different oam modes . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure was repeated for each mode and the reconstructed spectra are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a  b . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars represent the standard deviation over the ensemble of 30 measurements . the spectrum is broader for angular modes with narrower widths due to uncertainty relation between angular position and oam @xcite . as predicted by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqn : imagweakvalue ] , and shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : imagwv ] , the larger amplifications are obtained for angular modes with narrow widths . </S>",
    "<S> however , such narrow ang modes have physically smaller cross sections and hence carry proportionally less power . </S>",
    "<S> each oam power spectra was fitted using a weighted least - squares minimization to a shifted gaussian function . </S>",
    "<S> the mean values are plotting in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : imagwv]c along with error bars representing the @xmath54 confidence interval . by exploiting the measurement process </S>",
    "<S> we have amplified small rotations by a magnitude of 100 without using high oam nor entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been research casting doubt on the sensitivity of measurements based on wva @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been shown that in the presence of technical noise wvs , and more specifically imaginary wvs , outperform traditional measurements @xcite . therefore , our experiment can be potentially useful for sensitive measurement of small rotation in real world scenarios </S>",
    "<S> . a quantitative analysis of the sensitivity of our scheme can be done by using the fisher information metric . </S>",
    "<S> however , such quantitative comparison is outside the scope of the current work and will be the subject of a future study .    we have made the first step towards the study of wva in the azimuthal dof . </S>",
    "<S> this has been approached by describing the mechanisms that lead to a shift in the angular position and oam of an optical beam . </S>",
    "<S> the oam spectrum is shifted as a consequence of the breakup in the polarization symmetry , realized by a differential geometric phase . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have implemented the first realization of wva in the angular position and oam bases . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here provide a proof - of - principle demonstration of the scope of wva in this dof . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that our protocol opens the possibility for new schemes in optical metrology . </S>",
