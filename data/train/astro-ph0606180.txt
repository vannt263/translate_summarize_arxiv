    "redshifted absorption systems lying along the sight - lines to distant quasars are important probes of the early to present day universe . in particular , damped lyman-@xmath0 absorption systems ( dlas ) , where @xmath4 , are useful since they account for at least 80% of @xmath5 in the universe @xcite .",
    "since the lyman-@xmath0 transition occurs in the ultra - violet band , direct ground based observations of neutral hydrogen are restricted to redshifts of @xmath6 .",
    "however , observations of the  spin - flip transitions at @xmath7 cm can probe from @xmath8 , thereby providing a useful complement to the high redshift optical data .",
    "provided the 21-cm and lyman-@xmath0 absorption arise in the same cloud complexes , the column density @xmath9 [ ] of the absorbing gas in a homogeneous cloud is related to the velocity integrated optical depth of the 21-cm line via @xmath10 here @xmath11 [ k ] is the spin temperature of the gas and so in principle , armed with the neutral hydrogen column density from an observation of the lyman-@xmath0 line , this quantity may be derived from the optical depth of the 21-cm absorption .",
    "however , the observed optical depth of the 21-cm line also depends upon on how effectively the background radio continuum is covered by the absorber via , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the depth of the line relative to the flux density and @xmath14 is the covering factor of the flux by the absorber .    in the optically thin regime ( @xmath15 ) , which applies to all but one of the known 21-cm absorbing dlas , equation  [ enew ] reduces to @xmath16 thus giving a direct measure of the spin temperature of the gas for a known column density ( from the lyman-@xmath0 line ) and covering factor .",
    "however , in the absence of any direct measurement of the size of the radio absorbing region , this latter value is often assumed or at best estimated from the size of the background emission region .    from the literature , 16 of the 35 dlas",
    "searched have been found to exhibit 21-cm absorption ( see table [ t1 ] ) , all of which occur at redshifts below @xmath17 , although there are a near equal number of non - detections also below this redshift .",
    "@xcite therefore advocate a scenario where low redshift dlas have a mix of low ( 21-cm detections ) and high ( 21-cm non - detections ) spin temperatures , with the high redshift absorbers having exclusively high spin temperatures .",
    "however , in a previous paper @xcite , we find evidence that the importance of the covering factor is underestimated and the common practice of setting @xmath18 could possibly have the effect of assigning artificially high spin temperatures to dlas , particularly those not detected in 21-cm .",
    "furthermore , we found no statistical difference in the spin temperature / covering factor ratio between the low and high redshift samples , although the larger absorbing galaxies ( spirals ) group together at low values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "since the ratio of spin temperature / covering factor is @xmath21 ( equation  [ enew ] ) , we have taken into account the total column density of the absorber and integrated optical depth of the 21-cm absorption ( incorporating the radio flux ) .",
    "this suggests that the difference between the detections and non - detections is due to some other effect , a possibility which we investigate in this paper .",
    "we note that the cut - off of the 21-cm detections , @xmath22 , is close to the atmospheric cut - off of the lyman band at @xmath23 and over the range from which the mgii 2796/2803   doublet may be observed by ground - based telescopes ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "mgii selection gives rise to a range of absorbing galaxy types ( @xcite ) , and although most dlas discovered through the lyman-@xmath0 line have unidentified host types ( mainly due to the high redshift selection , e.g. table [ t1 ] ) , low redshift studies suggest that equal numbers of dwarfs and spirals should contribute to the dla population @xcite . in table",
    "[ t1 ] we see that the dlas detected in 21-cm absorption exhibit a variety of host galaxy types , although there is the strong preference for 21-cm absorption to occur in mgii selected sources .",
    "however , @xcite find that , while the 21-cm line strength appears correlated to the rest frame equivalent width of the mgii line ,    21-cm absorption is perfectly detectable at low equivalent widths . furthermore , large equivalent widths do not necessarily ensure a detection of 21-cm absorption ( fig .",
    "[ n - w - det ] ) .",
    "since host type and mgii equivalent width seem incidental in determining whether 21-cm absorption is detected , we suggest that the spin temperature / covering factor ratios in the dlas searched for in 21-cm absorption are due to geometric effects introduced by the dla discovery method : in fig . [ distance ] we show the spin temperature / covering factor ratio against the ratio of the angular diameter distances to the absorber and background continuum .",
    "although the sizes and morphologies of the radio sources differ considerably ( table 2 of @xcite ) , for given background continuum size and 21-cm absorbing cross section , the covering factor is obviously larger for those absorbers , at least at low redshift ( fig .",
    "[ z - distance ] ) , which are located very much closer to us than the radio emitter .",
    "indeed we see that the dlas not detected in 21-cm have significantly larger angular diameter distance ratios than the detections , with the vast majority of these having ratios of @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ distance ] ) .",
    "these are 1157 + 014 ( ratio = 1.00 ) and 1328 + 307 ( ratio = 0.93 ) . at @xmath65 ,",
    "the former is one of the highest redshifted 21-cm absorbers known and occults a radio source size of @xmath66 arc - secs @xcite and 1328 + 307 occults a core dominated source of 2.57 arc - secs @xcite . despite the pitfalls in assuming given absorber and emitter sizes , for the larger number of non - detections , the distribution does appear very skewed towards high fractional distances . ] .    in order to demonstrate the differences in fractional distances between the 21-cm detections and non - detections , in fig .",
    "[ z - distance ] we show how the distance ratio is distributed with absorber redshift .",
    "we see that most of the 21-cm detections are located in the bottom left quadrant , defined here by @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this is the approximate redshift of the turnover in the angular diameter distance , where objects increase their angular size with redshift .",
    "it is also close to the redshift where the lyman-@xmath0 transition can be observed by ground based telescopes , thus giving the appearance that lyman-@xmath0 selected dlas are less likely to be detected , although , as we see from fig .",
    "[ z - distance ] , this is purely a consequence of the higher redshifts probed by this transition .",
    "using this partitioning , at @xmath69 , for ratios of @xmath70 , 21-cm absorption tends to be detected ( 11 out of 13 cases ) and for @xmath71 , 21-cm absorption tends to be undetected ( 8 out of 10 cases ) . within each range , if there is an equal likelihood of obtaining either a 21-cm detection or non - detection , the binomial probability of 11 or more out of 13 detections occurring in one bin , while 8 or more out of 12 non - detections occur in the other bin is just 0.06% .",
    "changing the redshift partition to @xmath72 gives a binomial probability of 0.25% and no redshift partition , i.e. @xmath73 detections in one bin with @xmath74 non - detections in the other bin , gives 0.03% .",
    "this leads to the hypothesis that high redshift ( @xmath75 ) dlas tend not to be detected in 21-cm absorption because @xmath76 for all of these systems .",
    "[ z - distance ] illustrates that a redshift  distance ratio bias arises , since at @xmath77 the covering factor , see equation [ f ] .",
    "] becomes effectively independent of distance and is thereby determined by the relative extents of the absorption cross section and continuum emission region only . at lower redshifts ( particularly @xmath78 )",
    "the close - to - linear decrease of angular size with distance means that , for a given absorption cross section , low redshift systems can much more effectively cover the background emission . that is , above @xmath79 , 21-cm absorption searches are disadvantaged by the fact that in all cases @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , the angular diameter ",
    "redshift relationship dictates that the bottom right - hand quadrant of fig .",
    "[ z - distance ] is destined to always remain empty and the higher the value of @xmath80 , the lower @xmath81 must be in order to yield @xmath82 .    using the luminosity distances , a similar distribution to fig .",
    "[ z - distance ] is seen , with the concentration of 21-cm detections occurring at @xmath83 and the majority of non - detections having luminosity distance ratios of @xmath84 . therefore , as well as affecting the effective coverage of the quasar s emission , the generally close dla  qso proximity in the high redshift sample ( fig .",
    "[ distance ] ) could have implications for the spin temperature of the 21-cm absorbing gas in the dla through increased incident 21-cm flux .",
    "we now investigate this possibility as well as attempting to quantify the effect of the proximity bias on the covering factors .",
    "the high incidence of  21-cm non - detections with large fractional distances raises an interesting possibility : in order to explain the decrease in the number density of lyman-@xmath0 absorbers as @xmath85 , against the general increase in the number density with redshift , @xcite invoke a `` proximity effect '' , where at close to @xmath80 the absorber is subject to a high ionising flux from the quasar it occults , thus reducing the number of lyman-@xmath0 clouds observed . in light of the large number of 21-cm non - detections located relatively close to the background radio source ,",
    "an analogy of the proximity effect may be at play , where a high 21-cm flux is maintaining a higher population in the upper hyperfine level @xcite .",
    "this would decrease the observed 21-cm optical depth through an increase in stimulated emission ( equation [ enew ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of the quasar at the rest frame emission frequency , @xmath86 , is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the luminosity distance to the quasar , @xmath89 is the observed flux density ( given in table 1 of @xcite ) and @xmath90 is the k - correction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the 1420 mhz flux density at the absorber is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the luminosity distance between the absorber and the quasar .",
    "combining this with the previous equation gives @xmath93    since the observed frequency is given by both @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the continuum emission frequency in the rest frame of the quasar is given by @xmath96 [ where @xmath97 mhz in the rest frame of the absorber ] . from this , the redshift of the quasar in the rest frame of the absorber is given by @xmath98 which we use to determine @xmath99 .    in fig .",
    "[ 1216 ] we show the observational results of the  21-cm searches ( the spin temperature / covering factor ratio ) against the 21-cm flux density calculated at a distance @xmath99 from the quasar .    from this",
    "we see that below a flux density of @xmath100  jy at the absorber , there is no overwhelming difference in the 21-cm detections and non - detections , although the latter do tend to be more slightly numerous above @xmath101  jy , as well as being dominant at @xmath102  jy . however , the numbers are small and it appears as though increased flux densities due to close proximity to the background source is not the dominant cause of the non - detection of 21-cm absorption .      since it appears that the non - detections are not due to spin temperatures being raised by the quasar flux , we now focus on the how the covering factor varies with quasar proximity . as usual",
    ", we can not separate out the relative contributions from the spin temperature and the covering factor , although we can define , using the small angle approximation . ] , the covering factor as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the 21-cm absorbing cross section and @xmath105 is the radio source size as determined from high resolution observations ( see table 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "it should be borne in mind that these are usually measured at frequencies which are several times higher than the redshifted 21-cm ( 1420 mhz ) line .",
    "in addition to assuming that these provide an accurate indicator of the radio source size at the absorption frequency , equation [ f ] also assumes that the emission is uniform over the extent of this radio emission .",
    "if these assumptions are reasonable , substituting equation [ f ] into equation [ enew ] allows us to plot a covering factor `` free '' version of fig .",
    "[ distance ] , which we show in fig [ toverr - ratio ] .    in the plot , like figures 4 and 5 of @xcite ,",
    "we see a clear distinction between the distribution of the spirals and the more compact galaxies ( more evident in fig . [ r - flux ] ) .",
    "this may indicate that , at least at low redshift ( where @xmath106 ) , each group has similar ratios ( @xmath107 k kpc@xmath108 for the compact galaxies and @xmath109 k kpc@xmath108 for the spirals ) , with the absorbing cloud size making a large contribution in the very different values between these two groups : a span of @xmath110 orders of magnitude seems unlikely through spin temperature alone , although for a given temperature , a span of only @xmath111 dex is required in the radius of the absorbing region .",
    "furthermore , figure 4 of @xcite shows that the radio sources of @xmath112 tend to be adequately covered by the compact galaxies , whereas for the larger radio sources spirals are required .",
    "bearing in mind that two of the @xmath113 values at @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) are lower limits , in fig .",
    "[ toverr - ratio ] there may be a trend for @xmath116 to decrease as the dla ",
    "qso distance ( angular diameter & luminosity ) closes , for 21-cm absorption detected in non - spirals .",
    "presuming that the spin temperature does not decrease with proximity to the quasar ( contrary to what we would expect ) , this may suggest a selection effect where only large 21-cm absorbers are detected close to the background continuum , implying that self shielding against high fluxes are important , where the effectiveness of this scales with cloud size ( fig .",
    "[ r - flux ] ) .",
    "this , however , relies upon the aforementioned assumptions regarding the radio sources and many more detections would be required to adequately test this hypothesis .",
    "we note with interest , that the 21-cm detection located furthest to the bottom right in fig .",
    "[ toverr - ratio ] ( absorber i d unknown at @xmath117 ) , which has the very low value of @xmath118 k kpc@xmath108 ( @xmath119 kpc k@xmath120 , fig .",
    "[ r - flux ] ) , is due to 0458020 , where a large absorbing cross section of @xmath121 kpc is deduced from vla and vlbi observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "regarding the detectability of 21-cm absorption in dlas , we have found :    * in general , the non - detections of 21-cm absorption in dlas have been searched as deeply as the detections , meaning that the ratio of spin temperature / covering factor does not differ significantly between the two samples .",
    "* there is an apparent bias for 21-cm absorption to be detected in dlas originally discovered through the mgii doublet rather than the lyman-  line .",
    "this , however , is superficial and merely reflects the true bias introduced by the redshift distribution of the dlas :    at @xmath77 , the absorbers are effectively at the same ( angular ) distances as the background quasars . after ruling out the possibility that the closer proximity of the undetected dlas to the background quasars significantly raises the spin temperatures above those of the detections , we believe that the non - detections are due to low covering factors , the result of the flattening of the angular diameter distance at @xmath122 .    since dlas are not detected in 21-cm absorption at @xmath123 ( table [ t1 ] ) . ]",
    ", @xcite suggested that the non - detections are due to the high redshift ( @xmath124 ) dlas having exclusively high spin temperatures and the presence of both 21-cm detections and non - detections at low redshift is attributed to a mix of spin temperatures .",
    "however , the distribution of 21-cm detections and non - detections closely follows that of low and high angular diameter distance ratios , respectively , so that high redshift dlas have exclusively high ratios , whereas @xmath125 systems exhibit a mix of ratios .",
    "this geometric effect means that absorbers at high redshift will always cover the background quasar much less effectively than at low redshift and the degeneracy between spin temperature and covering factor may only ever be resolved by targetted searches for 21-cm absorption in high redshift dlas towards very compact radio sources .",
