    "the results carry over to modeling by fokker - planck equations .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in the next section , we briefly summarize the theory of integrating sdes and exemplify its practice for the van der pol oscillator undergoing stochastic forcing . in section",
    "[ estimation ] we discuss three approaches for parameter estimation in nonlinear stochastic differential equations . in section [ simulations ]",
    "we compare two of these approaches in a simulation study using the stochastic van der pol oscillator .",

    "this general form includes additive and multiplicative dynamical noise .",
    "@xmath2 is usually denoted as ( deterministic ) drift term , @xmath3 is called the diffusion term .",
    "the integration of a sde is not straightforward .",
    "this is due to the mathematical problems of evaluating integrals which involves the dynamical noise @xmath4 , see @xcite for a brief introduction and @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "applying the same ideas underlying higher order integration schemes for deterministic differential equation like runge - kutta @xcite to sdes leads to hardly treatable stochastic integrals given in @xcite .",
    "thus , only low order integration schemes can be used .",

    "it is usually possible to chose identical time steps for the integration and the sampling .",
    "the necessity of using a low order scheme for sdes means that the integration step size @xmath9 is usually much smaller than the sampling interval @xmath8 by which the time series is recorded .",

    "for realistic sampling intervals the  @xmath43  approach gives strongly biased results . only for a sampling time of @xmath73",
    "its estimate is consistent with the true parameter .",
    "this would require to sample the process with approximately 360 points per period . note that classical time series like the sunspot data and the canadian lynx data are sampled with 11 , respectively 10 points per period , see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "the relative bias of the  @xmath43  approach for sampling intervals @xmath75 and @xmath76 is larger than for @xmath24 due to the higher degree of nonlinearity .",

    " approach to work depends on the degree of nonlinearity .",
    "modeling time series of open nonequilibrium systems by nonlinear stochastic differential equations ( sde ) allows to take into account the effects of the huge number of degrees of freedom that might be active in such systems . a fundamental problem in estimating parameters in sdes is taught by the theory of integrating nonlinear stochastic differential equations .",
    "a central message from this theory is that there are in general two time scales : that of integration and that of sampling . as a consequence , the mean and the distributional characteristics of conditional densities on the time scale of sampling can , in general , not be related back to the parameters of the stochastic differential equation ( sde ) .",
    "we discussed three approaches for parameter estimation in sdes based on sampled time series .",
    "unfortunately , the desirable maximum likelihood approach is not feasible in the present context due to its extreme computational burden to estimate the conditional distributions . it might become tractable with the advent of more powerful massive parallel computers . in the presented simulation study , the quasi maximum likelihood approach yielded unbiased estimates for the parameter . disregarding the existence of the two time scales of integration and of sampling in sdes and using the discretization scheme of the sde itself on the time scale of the sampling led to results that are unbiased only for the case of heavy oversampling , but biased for conventional sampling rates .",
    "thus , methods that require the sampling time interval to be an admissable integration time step , like suggested in @xcite , are applicable to measured time series only for sufficiently sampled data .",
    "the same holds for the desirable approach to nonparametrically estimate the complete functional form of the deterministic drift term of a stochastic differential equation based on the discretization of the corresponding fokker - planck equation proposed in @xcite where formally even the limit  sampling interval @xmath77  is required .",
    "the approaches discussed in this paper require to observe the complete state space vector which is usually not possible .",
    "our future work will concentrate on the generalization to the case of parameter estimation in nonlinear stochastic differential equations based on scalar observations as it is already possible in linear stochastic and nonlinear deterministic systems @xcite .",
