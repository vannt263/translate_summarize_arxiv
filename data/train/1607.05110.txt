    "it is interesting that this exponent is approximately twice the value of the leading correction exponent @xmath166 that we have found for other quantities .",
    "this suggests that the leading corrections of the two gaps are equal , @xmath167 and the prefactors of the power - laws are the same .",

    "it should be noted that the coupling ratio considered here , @xmath110 , is very close to but not exactly at the critical ratio @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "being slightly on the afm side of the transition , the triplet @xmath7 gap could be marginally affected by the quantum rotor states , the gaps to which asymptotically scale as @xmath179 @xcite , and the @xmath5 triplet may be affected by the small gap expected in the weak afm state at this wave - vector .",
    "the corrections analyzed above could then be partially due to cross - overs into such afm scaling , i.e. , the exponent @xmath61 would then be only an effective exponent for the range of sizes considered . analyzing the gaps at the crossing point , as we did in fig .",

    "the temporal winding number @xmath196 simply counts the difference between the number of up and down spins , while the spatial winding numbers @xmath197 ( here @xmath198 in two dimensions ) correspond to a quantization of the net spin currents due to periodic boundaries in space and time .",
    "if a qmc simulation includes updates that can change the winding numbers , which the loop updates in the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) method used here indeed can @xcite , physical quantities related to the winding number fluctuations can be computed @xcite .",

    "the effective length of the system in the time dimension is @xmath203 .",
    "it has been argued that a cubic space - time geometry ( i.e. , with the system having effectively equal lengths in space and time ) should be defined by requiring the following condition for a given spatial system size @xmath50 @xcite : @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the unique value of @xmath25 for which the equality holds .",
    "this criterion offers an interesting way to compute the velocity @xmath119 of excitations as the aspect ratio : @xmath206 .",
    "one can expect this procedure to deliver the correct velocity in the limit @xmath80 . in some cases",
    "this can be shown directly based on low - energy field theory @xcite , but even in the absence of such descriptions the arguments are very general and one can expect the correct velocity for any system with linear dispersion . in ref .",

[ fig : dispersion ] , which is already almost @xmath80 converged away from the gapless points ) . in the dqc theory , weak spinon - spinon interactions are predicted to lead to a small gap to singlets @xcite , which we have not been able to confirm here . </S>",
    "<S> we can of course not rule out an extremely small gap beyond the precision of our study , but another possibility is that the spinons in fact are fully deconfined in the case of su(2 ) spins , and that this is directly related to an emergent so(5 ) symmetry @xcite , which has been argued to be a special dqc feature not present for su(n ) spins with @xmath137 .    </S>",
