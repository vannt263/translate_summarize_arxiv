    "small cells such as femto , pico , and microcells have been aroused general interest lately due to their consequential effect on enhancing network capacity , stretching service coverage and cutting back network energy consumption @xcite .",
    "in many residential and enterprise small cells , according to the duration of stay , users can be grouped into two categories : sojourners and inhabitants . besides the duration of stay ,",
    "other features can be pinpointed : the status in the network , the quality of service ( qos ) requirements , the geographical location , the regularity or predictability of the entry and exit time .",
    "* motivated example : * * _ _ * a concrete instance in real life can well elaborate the above concept . an office area",
    "is covered by a small cell .",
    "the staffs and visitors can be classified as inhabitants and sojourners , respectively .",
    "staffs have fixed entry and exit time , while visitors enter and depart randomly .",
    "staffs have higher status , settled and specific qos requirements , while visitors do not . the staffs and visitors have their own area to stay in , such as the working area for staffs and the reception area for visitors .",
    "they also have the common area to stay like the meeting room .    * existing approaches and their limitations : * * _ _ * multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) technologies are essential components in 3gpp long term evolution ( lte)-advanced @xcite . among them , multiuser mimo technology is markedly advantageous to enhance the cell capacity especially in highly spatial correlated channels @xcite , since multiuser mimo technology can serve multiple users simultaneously on the same frequency . dirty paper coding ( dpc ) @xcite and block diagonalization ( bd ) @xcite are two widely adopted techniques for multiuser mimo .",
    "dpc is contrived to suit the capacity optimal requirement @xcite , however , it is hard to implement owing to its complexity .",
    "bd is a practical approach which adopts precoding to completely eliminate inter - user interference .",
    "the deficiency of this technique is that bd precoding and full rank transmission requires that the number of transmit antennas is not less than the total number of receive antennas .",
    "therefore , the number of concurrently supportable users is restricted by the number of transmit antennas .",

    "cscs divides one small cell into two customized sub - small cells for inhabitants and sojourners respectively for the following reasons .",
    "\\1 ) cscs is a design in line with the trend of green communications @xcite , which plays a significant role of saving energy :    * each of two sub - small cells is served by its own sub - small cell access point ( ap ) .",
    "issc serves the inhabitants by inhabitant access point ( iap ) .",
    "sssc serves the sojourners by sojourner access point ( sap ) . in the case of a small overlap between the two groups activity areas , utilizing two sub - small cell aps instead of one single small cell ap shortens the average distance between user equipment ( ue ) and ap .",
    "accordingly , it reduces the total transmit power . * considering that inhabitants and sojourners may have two different active timetables , cscs can turn the sub - small cell ap off outside the active period of the group which it serves .",
    "however , ap of a collective small cell can only turn itself off when both groups are inactive .",
    "\\2 ) cscs enhances the number of concurrently supportable users .",
    "we consider this in the context of bd precoding and full rank transmission .",
    "the number of transmit antennas on ap restricts the number of concurrently supportable users .",
    "the number of transmit antennas on a single ap is limited by many factors , such as the processing speed of ap and the size of ap . by utilizing two different sub - small cell aps",
    ", cscs enables more transmit antennas to be installed in the whole small cell , thereby enhancing the number of concurrently supportable users .",

    "are ensured by a primary sub - small cell .",
    "the sojourners are served by a secondary sub - small cell .",
    "the primary sub - small cell and the secondary sub - small cell utilize the same spectrum on condition that the level of interference caused by the secondary sub - small cell to the primary sub - small cell is kept tolerable @xcite .",
    "* design challenges : *    * _ 1 ) determining the number of transmit antennas : _ * _ _ bd precoding and full rank transmission requires that the number of transmit antennas is not less than the total number of receive antennas .",
    "therefore , the number of concurrently supportable users is limited by the number of transmit antennas . when the number of users is greater than the number of concurrently supportable users , ap will select users to simultaneously serve using some kind of user selection algorithm .",
    "qos requirements and the number of users who simultaneously present make demands on the number of concurrently supportable users . on the other hand , configuring overmany transmit antennas results in a waste of resources .",
    "* _ 2 ) inter - sub - small cell interference : _ * _ _ due to bd precoding , issc and sssc will not cause downlink inter - sub - small cell interference when perfect iap - to - sojourner csi and sap - to - inhabitant csi are acquired by iap and sap respectively .    in practice ,",
    "the perfect acquisition of sap - to - inhabitant csi is hampered by the lack of explicit coordination and full cooperation between issc and sssc , since inhabitants are scant of willingness to feedback sap - to - inhabitant csi by using their own bandwidth and power .",

    "the observation time interval is set to be consistent with the working hours for all data sets .",
    "we divide the observation time interval into @xmath164 time slots , each @xmath165 minutes in length .",
    "data set 1 and data set 2 have the same attributes except the standard deviation of the duration of stay .",
    "these two data sets are considered as the benchmark for comparison and designing the other data sets .",
    "data set 3 and data set 4 are designed by adding 30 minutes to every sample of the duration of stay in data set 1 and set 2 .",
    "data set 5 and data set 6 are designed by changing the immutable arrival rate of data set 1 and data set 2 to 5 arrivals per time slot during 10 - 11 am and 30/42 arrivals per time slot during the other working hours .",
    "date set 7 and set 8 are designed by adding 30 to the total number of sojourners during the observation time interval of data set 1 and data set 2 and make the the standard deviation of the duration of stay of data set 7 and data set 8 to be close to that of data set 1 and data set 2 respectively .",
    "we exploit empht algorithm @xcite to fit the phase type distribution to the data of duration of stay in each data set .",
    "the empht is an iterative maximum likelihood estimation algorithm which outputs the @xmath36 vector @xmath166 and @xmath30 matrix @xmath29 .",
    "we chose the number of phases as 4 , i.e. @xmath167 .",
    "we acquire these two parameters based on each data set after sufficient iterations when the likelihood function reaches zero growth and accordingly obtain the cdf of the duration of stay for each data set .",
    "we further calculate the mean value of the cumulative probability of the number of concurrent sojourners during the observation time interval base on each of these 8 data sets and showed them in figure [ fig:2 ] . from them",
    ", we can observe how the following factors influence the number of concurrent sojourners and further impact the number of transmit antennas on sub - small cell aps :    * the standard deviation of the duration of stay * the mean of the duration of stay * the distribution of arrival rate * the total number of sojourners during the observation time interval    from figure [ fig:2 ] , we observe that as @xmath48 increases , its sample mean of the cumulative probability of the number of concurrent sojourners during the observation time interval based on 8 data sets all exhibit uptrend and the rate of growth declines gradually .",
    "the values of @xmath168 $ ] based on data set 1 until data set 8 are : 0.8237 , 0.9354 , 0.4711 , 0.5223 , 0.7550 , 0.8849 , 0.4048 and 0.6905 .",

    ", we can observe that : the number of concurrent sojourners during the observation time interval being more than 20 has a very small probability ( < 0.03 ) for all data set 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 and 8 and a small probability ( < 0.11 ) for data set 5 and 6 .",
    "this number being no more than 10 has a large probability ( > 0.8 ) for data set 1 and 2 , followed by data set 5 and 6 ( > 0.75 ) . for data set 3 , 4 , 7 and 8 , this number being no more than 10 and between 10 and 20 have almost the same probability ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "referring to figure [ fig:2 ] , we can find that the increasement of the mean of the duration of stay , non - uniform arrival rate or the increase of the total number of sojourners during the observation time interval improves the probability of the number of concurrent sojourners being a relatively large number .",
    "the increasement of standard deviation of the duration of stay brings down this probability .",
    "however , when the mean of the duration of stay is relatively large , the standard deviation of the duration of stay has minimal impact on this probability as shown in figure 2 ( b ) .",
    "accordingly , the number of transmit antennas on sub - small cell access points are chosen to be relatively large when the mean of the duration of stay or the total number of sojourners is relatively large , the arrival rate is non - uniform or the standard deviation of the duration of stay is relatively small .    from the third set of experimental result , we can see that the augmentation of standard deviation of the duration of stay causes that the convergence of the sample means of the cumulative probability of the number of concurrent sojourners during the observation time interval to be more slowly and the low growth rate emergences earlier .",
    "but when the mean of the duration of stay is relatively large , this phenomenon is not obvious .",
    "so we need to choose a relatively small value for @xmath59 in equation ( [ eq : determine n2 - 1 ] ) or @xmath60 in equation ( [ eq : determine n2 - 2 ] ) when the standard deviation of the duration of stay is relatively large and the mean of the duration of stay is relatively small .      for simplicity",
    "we assume that the inter - sub - small cell interference only exists in the overlapping area between issc and sssc in our simulation .",
    "we consider that 2 sojourners and 2 inhabitants stay in the overlap of issc and sssc , where all the sojourners and inhabitants have the same distance from the sap .",
    "the path loss component is normalized to one .",
    "@xmath181 and @xmath182 are both modeled as a matrix with coefficients which are i.i.d .",
    "circularly symmetric , complex gaussian random variables , with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "@xmath183 is modeled as a matrix with coefficients which are i.i.d .",
    "circularly symmetric , complex gaussian random variables , with zero mean and variance @xmath184 .",
    "we set that @xmath160 in equation ( [ eq : uncertainty region ] ) equals to @xmath184 .",
    "the number of receive antennas at every ue is set to be 2 and the maximum signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at every ue is set to be @xmath185 .",
    "the maximum downlink transmit power of sap is 10w .",
    "the sap exploits 4 subcarriers for downlink transmission .",
    "each subcarrier occupies a normalized bandwidth of @xmath186 .    for the purpose of comparing the performance of _ bdbf _ with the interference controller that uses optimal bf alone , we design two test systems : 1 .",
    "downlink bd precoding for the secondary sub - small cell takes both sojourners and inhabitants who stay in the coverage area into consideration , i.e. the sssc using @xmath148 ; 2 .",
    "downlink bd precoding for the secondary sub - small cell takes only sojourners into consideration , i.e. the sssc using @xmath149 .",
    "we simulate the above systems which exploit bd precoding based on sap - to - inhabitant csi with different radius of uncertainty region ( @xmath160=0 , 0.1 , 1 , 5 and 10 ) and fed perfect sap - to - inhabitant csi to the optimal bf .",
    "we plot the average capacity of sssc and the average interference to inhabitants on each subcarrier which are obtained by using 2000 monte - carlo realizations in figure [ fig3:average - capacity vs interference threshold ] and figure [ fig4:average - interference vs inter threshold ] respectively .    ,",
    "width=321,height=188 ]    , width=321,height=188 ]    figure [ fig3:average - capacity vs interference threshold ] reveals the following information .",
    "1 . for the system adopts bd precoding including inhabitants , the average capacity of sssc shakes off the shackles of interference threshold within the small radius of uncertainty region . for @xmath187 ,",
    "the average capacity of sssc achieves 54.7651 bps when the interference threshold is 1.75w .",
    "after that it oscillates on small scale and no longer increases with the enhancement of threshold .",
    "this is because bd precoding based on uncertain csi can inhibit the interference below the interference threshold within the small radius of uncertainty region .",
    "figure [ fig4:average - interference vs inter threshold ] exhibits that the average interference to inhabitants on each subcarrier for @xmath187 is maintained below the threshold when the threshold is no less than 0.25w . for @xmath188 , since bd precoding based on perfect csi , the interference is completely eliminated and accordingly the average capacity of sssc has no relationship with the interference threshold .",
    "it fluctuates slightly with the fluctuation of channel between sap and sojourners . for @xmath189 , the auxiliary optimal",
    "bf plays the leading role in inhibiting the interference .",
    "the actual interference is always equal to the threshold . the average capacity of sssc exhibits uptrend as the threshold is enhanced .",
    "system adopts bd precoding including inhabitants achieves higher capacity compared with that exploits bd precoding excluding inhabitants within a considerably large radius of uncertainty region .",
    "the average capacity of sssc of the first system declines as the radius of uncertainty region increases .",
    "it should be noted that until @xmath160 increases to @xmath165 , the average capacity of sssc of the first system is still higher than that of the second system with @xmath188 .",
    "this verifies theorem 2 .",
    "in regard to design issues in cscs , we put forward practical propositions for determining the number of transmit antennas and controlling downlink inter - sub - small cell interference .",
    "we found how the factors influence the number of concurrent sojourners and further impact the number of transmit antennas on sub - small cell aps .",
    "we proved and verified that _ bdbf _ performs better than the interference controller using optimal bf alone for gaining more capacity within a bearably large radius of uncertainty region .",
