    "the anomalous frequency and dissipation behavior seen in torsion oscillators ( to ) @xcite at low temperatures has stimulated numerous investigations , since it was suggested to be the signature of supersolidity @xcite .",
    "recent successive to experiments @xcite confirmed the finding of the anomalous behavior .",
    "in addition , hysteresis behavior and long equilibration times have been observed @xcite , which depend strongly on growth history and annealing @xcite . in the same temperature range ,",
    "transport experiments including shear modulus @xcite , ultrasonic @xcite and heat propagation @xcite have shown various anomalous behaviors .",
    "however , no clear sign in mass flow @xcite and structural measurements @xcite emerged that can demonstrate the occurrence of a phase transition .",
    "it has been anticipated that thermodynamic measurements will resolve the existing controversy , since any true phase transition should be accompanied by a thermodynamic signature .",
    "the search for such signatures proved to be challenging by the experiments conducted so far , including measurements of the specific heat @xcite , pressure dependence of the melting curve @xcite , and pressure - temperature measurements of the solid @xcite .",
    "the main difficulties lie in measuring small signals at low temperatures in the presence of large backgrounds . with improving experiments at low temperatures , measurements down to 20 mk",
    "were conducted . while there is still no clear evidence of transition in the melting curve experiments , recent pressure measurements and specific heat measurements",
    "have both shown deviations from the expected pure debye lattice behavior .",
    "balatsky and coworkers @xcite argued that the deviations occurring at low temperatures might be related to a glass phase , where the role of two - level systems could be taken by tunneling dislocation loop segments .",
    "this description is also accompanied by an argument that the excess entropy associated with the deviation is too small for supersolidity to lead to detectable mechanical effects , if it is due to a supersolid fraction alone .    in this paper",
    ", we expand the above glass model to describe the glass freezing transition occurring in the thermodynamic experiments of ultrapure @xmath0he solid .",
    "we model the subsystem of tunneling dislocation segments with a compact distribution of two - level excitation spacings , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] .",
    "we can then describe the behavior of a transition as well as the zero - temperature extrapolation of the glassy behavior seen in thermodynamic measurements .",
    "our results show that the low - temperature deviations in the measured specific heat can be explained by contributions from a glassy fraction of the solid .",
    "these results add further support to our previous interpretation of torsion oscillator experiments in terms of a backaction due to a glassy subsystem , which is possibly present in solid @xmath0he  @xcite .",
    "we propose a thermodynamic model to describe the measured low - temperature specific heat .",
    "we postulate the existence of a distribution of two - level tunneling ( tls ) systems in solid hcp @xmath0he .",
    "these tls may be created through complex configurations of dislocation loops embedded in the crystal or strain during growth .",
    "the distributions of length and number of dislocation segments depend on @xmath2he concentration , quenching and other growth processes . in this paper",
    ", we are comparing the effect of different growth processes on ultrapure @xmath0he  containing at most ( nominally ) 1 ppb of @xmath2he  impurities . at such low levels of impurities ,",
    "we expect to see the intrinsic properties of solid @xmath0he .",
    "we start with the expansion of the standard tls model ( fig .  [ fig : dos ] ) . in the standard glass model @xcite for solids ,",
    "the density of the tls states is assumed to be constant , @xmath3 = const . , to account for the linear temperature coefficient in the specific heat at low temperatures .",
    "however , it is well - known in the context of conventional glasses that a more careful analysis of specific heat data gives rise to a power law deviating slightly from linearity .",
    "the deviation may be attributed to phonon relaxation processes @xcite or to a density of states ( dos ) of the tls that is not constant over a characteristic energy @xmath4 of level spacings @xcite . here",
    ", we neglect the time dependence in the specific heat due to phonons scattering off from the tls and for simplicity concentrate on the cutoff dependence of the dos at high energies . for example",
    ", such a cutoff could be due to the finite barrier height of double - well potentials giving rise to the tls , because in real materials the tunneling barrier has an upper bound set by lattice and dislocation configurations @xcite .",
    "this is also the reason why glassy behavior is usually only seen at sufficiently low temperatures . at high temperatures",
    "the thermal energy can easily overcome the barrier and the tls effectively become a system of noninteracting single oscillators . at @xmath1 , the specific heat of solid @xmath0he",
    "is well described by @xmath5 where the phonon contribution to the molar specific heat is given by @xmath6 , with coefficient @xmath7 , @xmath8 mj/(mol k ) is the gas constant , and @xmath9 is the debye temperature .",
    "the second term describes the glass contribution due to the tls subsystem and is given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath12 is the fermi function .",
    "the dos of the tls may be modeled by the box distribution function @xmath13   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the zero - energy dos per energy , @xmath4 is a characteristic cutoff energy , and @xmath15 is the width of the truncated density of states . for @xmath16 ,",
    "one obtains the standard hallmark result of glasses at low temperatures : @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "as we will elaborate in the next section , the glass coefficient @xmath19 has an intrinsic finite value at low temperature even for the purest @xmath0he samples , independent of @xmath2he  concentration .",

    "we compare our model calculations with experimental data by the penn state group @xcite for four different growth processes in ultrapure @xmath0he  with at most 1 ppb of @xmath2he  impurities .",
    "we re - analyzed their experiments and obtained quite different assignments for the state of two of their samples : we find two solid - liquid coexistence samples with solid ratios 0.34 ( sl34 ) and 0.31 ( sl31 ) @xcite , while we agree with the assignments for the samples grown with the blocked capillary method ( bc ) .",
    "one was grown over 20 hours ( bc20 ) , the other one was grown over 4 hours ( bc04 ) .",
    "notice that sample sl34 corresponds to the 75% solid - liquid coexistence sample reported by the penn state group and that the sl31 sample corresponds to their constant pressure sample ( cp ) .",
    "the experimental data are described with three parameters : @xmath14 , @xmath4 and the debye temperature @xmath9 .",
    "we first determine @xmath9 , or the lattice contribution , from the high - temperature data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : clog ] ) . the phonon contribution",
    "is then subtracted from @xmath23 to obtain the difference @xmath22 .",
    "we fit @xmath24 with our specific heat formula in eq .",

    "we show the difference in specific heat over temperature , @xmath24 , for four different growth processes in fig .",

    "the model describes well the low - temperature part for all four cases and the high - temperature part is within the scatter of the experimental data . in these plots we fixed the width of the cutoff to @xmath25 . with @xmath26",
    ", we have verified that there is no qualitative difference when varying @xmath15 within reasonable ranges .",
    "notice that the shape of @xmath27 depends strongly on the subtraction of the high - temperature phonon contribution .",
    "although the debye temperature used for the bc samples is reasonable , it is not unique in determining the shape of @xmath27 , since a usual 1% uncertainty in the data of @xmath28 at high temperatures leads to quite large uncertainties in @xmath29 .",
    ".physical and model parameters : debye temperature @xmath9 , zero energy tls dos @xmath14 , cutoff energy @xmath4 , concentration of tls @xmath30 and excess entropy @xmath31 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ para_table ]    the physical and model parameters of the four samples grown under different conditions are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the debye temperature @xmath9 of @xmath0he increases linearly with decreasing molar volume @xmath32 in the range between 21 and 16 cm@xmath2/mol @xcite .",
    "this is also the pressure range in which the experimental data were taken .",
    "we find that @xmath9 for both bc grown samples agrees reasonably well with literature values of 28 - 29 k at molar volume @xmath34 cm@xmath2/mol and pressure @xmath35 bar . the same consistency is found for the coexistence samples , after correcting for the solid - liquid ratio @xcite , with the reported literature value of @xmath36 k at @xmath37 bar @xcite .",
    "a caveat is warranted regarding sample sl31 . since it has a slightly larger concentration of tls than sl34 , although it should be equally pure .",
    "hence , one needs to consider that it was supposedly grown under cp conditions at @xmath38 bar .",
    "however , it is not clear if the final pressure of the cell was actually 25 bar or higher , nor how strained the crystal was when the initial pressure of 38 bar was lost .",
    "all these experimental unknowns may change our assignment for the solid - liquid coexistence ratio for sl31 .",
    "thus its solid - to - liquid ratio of @xmath39 should be considered a lower bound @xcite .",
    "the glassy behavior is mainly characterized by the zero - energy dos and cutoff energy of the tls , which are both noticeably larger in bc04 than in the others .",
    "this may be explained by a rapid growth process creating a strained crystal , which gives rise to both a larger tls concentration and a smaller cutoff energy , i.e. , a smaller maximum tunneling barrier height . on the other hand ,",
    "the comparison of sample sl31 with bc20 leads us to believe that @xmath2he concentration does not appear to play an important role at the 1 ppb concentration level and below .",
    "the coexistence sample sl31 is supposed to be purer than bc20 ( @xmath2he atoms are more soluble in liquid than solid @xmath0he ) .",
    "our analysis does not show significant differences between parameters for both cases .",
    "this is supported by our analysis that the tls concentration of these samples ranges from @xmath40 to @xmath41 ppm , which is at least 1000 times larger than the nominal @xmath2he concentration .",
    "we argue that this small concentration of @xmath2he  impurities , compared to the intrinsic concentration of tls in even the best crystals grown by the penn state group , explains the experimental finding that the sample grown with the bc method for over 4 hours and 0.3 ppm of @xmath2he  impurities exhibits nearly identical behavior as sample bc04 with only 1 ppb of @xmath2he .",
    "we therefore conclude that the intrinsic property of solid @xmath0he was measured in the samples with 1 ppb @xmath2he  impurities , given the much larger tls concentration levels found .",
    "we also calculated the excess entropy , @xmath42 associated with the excess specific heat due to the low - temperature transition or crossover into a glass phase .",
    "the advantage of an entropy analysis over that of the specific heat lies in the robustness and simplicity of counting states in an equilibrium phase compared to detailed model calculations for the specific heat .",
    "we find consistently for specific heat experiments @xcite that the obtained values are 5 to 6 orders of magnitude smaller compared to the theoretical prediction for a supersolid if the entire sample underwent bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) . in the limit of a non - interacting bec",
    "one finds @xmath43 j/(k mol ) .",
    "this means that if @xmath31 is indeed due to supersolidity , then the supersolid volume fraction is at most 11 ppm or 0.0011% in the most disordered or quenched sample of the four ultrapure samples studied in this work , i.e. , sample bc04 .",
    "such a supersolid fraction in the specific heat of bulk @xmath0he  is more than 100 to 1000 times smaller than is usually reported for the non - classical rotational inertia fraction ( ncrif ) in torsion oscillator experiments .",
    "this enormous discrepancy between supersolid fractions in specific heat and torsion oscillator experiments was already noticed in refs .",

    "[ fig : pressure ] ( b ) ) . the glass contribution is larger in grigorev s sample and survives to higher temperatures compared to predictions for samples bc04 and bc20 .",

    "the coefficient @xmath64 can actually vary significantly from one sample to another@xcite . here , for simplicity",
    ", it is taken to be the same both in pressure and in specific heat measurements .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the pressure measurement as well as the specific heat measurement are consistently described in the framework of the modified glass model .",
    "the higher tls concentration extracted from grigorev s data compared to lin s data is likely due to a much faster cooling rate or due to a larger greneisen coefficient or both .",
    "we have shown that a simple tls model explains quantitatively the linear temperature coefficient in the specific heat and the low - temperature deviation of the specific heat , @xmath70 , from that of a perfect debye crystal without postulating the existence of supersolidity . by truncating the tls dos above a characteristic cutoff energy @xmath4 , the bump - like feature in @xmath70",
    "can fairly well be captured within the scatter and uncertainty of the data .",
    "furthermore , our thermodynamic analysis results in debye temperatures @xmath9 and tls dos @xmath14 that are in qualitative agreement with known @xmath55 measurements in the solid @xcite .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a glassy subsystem at the ppm level in hcp @xmath0he crystals .",
    "the presence of a glassy subsystem is consistent with recent reports of long relaxation times in torsion oscillators @xcite , @xmath71 vs. @xmath50 measurements @xcite , and transport measurements @xcite . in order to uniquely determine the ground state of solid @xmath0he , i.e. , whether it exhibits a supersolid or glass transition , more accurate measurements of the specific heat and thermal conductivity at lower temperatures and up",
    "to 0.5 k are needed .",
