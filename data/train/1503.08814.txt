    "the superposition principle is of prime importance in quantum mechanics and has been demonstrated for neutrons @xcite , in superconductors @xcite , in nanomagnets @xcite , with trapped ions @xcite , with photons in cavities @xcite and for large molecules @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , interferences of macroscopic objects are not yet accessible @xcite .",
    "macroscopic schrdinger cat states are of particular interest in the context of the quantum - to - classical transition @xcite , tests of collapse models @xcite and the search for gravitational decoherence @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty is the strong suppression of coherences since macroscopic systems can not be isolated completely from their environment and the emission and absorption of blackbody radiation washes out the interference pattern @xcite .    the preparation of a spatial ( macroscopic ) superposition requires that the wavefunction of the composite object is split into two ( or more ) components .",
    "this can be done , for example , with an apparatus which acts as a partially silvered mirror , separating the incoming wave - packet into a reflected and a transmitted part . in the following",
    "we will show that long - lived resonances can occur due to the presence internal degrees of freedom of the composite object .",
    "furthermore , the wavepacket components can decohere partially when internal degrees of freedom are excited during the scattering process",
    ". these effects are also present when the system is perfectly isolated from the environment .    during a scattering process of a composite object ,",
    "it is likely that not all individual constituents interact directly with the mirror .",
    "for example , rutherford - scattering affects only the protons of @xmath0-particles directly whereas the neutrons do not feel the coulomb potential of the heavy nuclei .",
    "since the protons and neutrons are bound to each other by nuclear forces , the neutrons follow the trajectory of the protons .",
    "the situation that only a part of the composite object interacts with a scattering center is rather generic , the atom - light interaction being another example : only the dipole moment of the electron is affected by the electromagnetic field whereas the nucleus is not sensitive to the wavelength of the photons .",
    "a simple model hamiltonian , which resembles the interaction of an single ( center - of - mass ) degree of freedom with a mirror , is @xmath1 where we assume that the potential has the form @xmath2 . an incoming plane wave with momentum @xmath3 will be partially transmitted and reflected , i.e. @xmath4 where the amplitudes for transmission and reflection are determined by @xmath5    choosing @xmath6 we have @xmath7 which mimics a half - silvered mirror .",
    "the system exhibits a resonance for @xmath8 and a bound state for @xmath9 .",
    "since we have @xmath10 , the dynamics of a wavepacket which is centered around a finite momentum value will not be affected by the resonance . in the following",
    "we will see how the situation changes when the dynamics of internal degrees of freedom is taken into account .",
    "consider two particles with unit mass and coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "both particles are tied to each other by a binding potential @xmath13 which depends only on the difference of the particle positions , @xmath14 . in general , we allow both particles to interact with a mirror and introduce the scattering potentials @xmath15 .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the scattering of this bound system is given by @xmath16     is nonzero along the dotted line whereas @xmath17 is nonzero along the dashed line.,width=453 ]    where @xmath18 are the momentum operators of the individual particles .",
    "it is useful to formulate the problem in terms of the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath19 and the relative coordinate @xmath20 .",
    "an arbitrary wave - packet is of the form @xmath21 where the @xmath22 are time - dependent functions which only depend center - of - mass coordinate and the @xmath23 fulfill eigenvalue equation @xmath24 the choice of the binding potential determines how far the particles can separate from each other . when we choose a hard wall potential , the system is related to a two - dimensional waveguide , see fig .",
    "[ waveguide ] .    inserting the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) into the time - dependent schrdinger equation , multiplying with @xmath25 and integrating over @xmath26 leads to a set of coupled equations , @xmath27",
    "@xmath28 is the effective potential which couples the functions @xmath22 .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions @xmath23 of the binding potential , @xmath29 we assume that the wave - packet is initially of the form @xmath30 where the initial momentum of the center - of - mass coordinate is denoted with @xmath31 and the spread of the wave packet with @xmath32 . the wave - packet is initially centered to the left of the mirror , @xmath33 , and follows a free evolution before it hits the mirror .",
    "the `` internal '' degree of freedom is assumed to be in the ground state @xmath34 .",
    "a simple binding potential is the harmonic coupling @xmath35 with stiffness @xmath36 . from the eigenvalue equation ( [ eig ] ) we find that the energy levels of the internal degree of freedom are @xmath37 .",
    "the effective coupling potential @xmath38 is determined by the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath39 .",
    "first , we discuss the situation when only one particle interacts directly mirror whereas particle 2 is only affected indirectly by the mirror via the binding potential .",
    "this corresponds to the choice @xmath41 and @xmath42 in our model . in oder to mimic a half - silvered mirror , we choose the parameter @xmath43 and the initial momentum @xmath31 such that half of the wave - packet is transmitted and half of it is reflected , in fig .  [ dynamics ] we show the reduced density matrix @xmath44 and the square of the modulus of the wavefunction at different times .",
    "the wavepacket is localized before the scattering process , see fig .",
    "[ dynamics ] ( a ) .",

    "since half of the wavepacket is transmitted and half of it is reflected , we have @xmath49 after the scattering .",
    "the composite system is in a pure state which allows us to characterize the excitation of the wave - packet by the entanglement - entropy , @xmath50 .",

    "[ energyentropyprd ] ( b ) .",
    "the internal degree is more excited when the bound system is reflected : one particle is reflected by the mirror , the second one passed through and is pulled back through the mirror due to the binding potential @xmath54 .",
    "this leads to an increased excitation compared to the transmission where both particles go through the mirror without the internal dynamics being involved .",

    "again , we choose the initial momentum and the value of @xmath62 such that half of the wave - packet is transmitted and half of it is reflected .",
    "the scattering potential does not mix the symmetric modes @xmath23 , ( @xmath63 ) with the antisymmetric modes @xmath23 , ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "therefore antisymmetric modes do not become excited when the system is initially in the ground state , see fig .",
    "[ modesdoubleprd ] .",
    "this in turn implies that the energy gap between ground state and first accessible excited state is @xmath65 rather than @xmath66 . as a consequence ,",

    "( c ) the wavefunction is trapped in the triangles which are defined by the lines @xmath67 and @xmath45 .",
    ", width=336 ]    an interesting feature of the symmetric scattering is that it takes a rather long time before the occupation probabilities become temporal constants .",
    "this is due to the occurence of long - lived resonances .",
    "intuitively , this can be understood from the sketch in fig .",
    "[ waveguide ] : when particle 1 is reflected at @xmath67 , it pulls back particle 2 , then particle 2 is reflected at @xmath45 and particle 1 is pulled back .",
    "this can happen several times until the wave - packet finally separates from the mirror .",
    "as a result , a part of the wave - function is trapped in the `` triangles '' for a finite time . although most of the wave - function has separated from the mirror after the scattering , there is a non - vanishing probability to find the particles at the mirror .",
    "the interference pattern of @xmath68 after the scattering process is depicted in fig .",
    "[ dynamicsdoubleprd ] ( a ) whereas the wave - function is shown in fig .",
    "[ dynamicsdoubleprd ] ( b ) . in fig .",
    "[ dynamicsdoubleprd ] ( c ) one can see how the wave - function is trapped in the triangles .",
    "in general , resonances can be characterized as eigenvalues of the hamiltonian which is subject to non - hermitian boundary conditions .",
    "a simple example was given in the introduction : the scattering of a particle at a delta - function potential with positive prefactor @xmath69 exhibits a resonance for the wavenumber @xmath70 .",
    "the corresponding wave - function is not in the hermitian sector of the domain of the physical hamiltonian and grows exponentially for large @xmath71 , @xmath72 . in the following we use the complex scaling method to determine the position of the resonances",
    "@xcite : the core of this method is a transformation of the hamiltonian such that the resonant eigenfunctions become square integrable .",
    "for the problem at hand , this can be achieved by transforming the the center - of - mass coordinate according to @xmath73 .",
    "when the angle @xmath74 is large enough , the eigenfunction of a particular resonance decreases exponentially for @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the complex energy @xmath76 can be determined from the eigenvalue problem for the transformed hamiltonian .",
    "the value of @xmath76 is locally independent on @xmath77 and appears as isolated point in the spectrum , see appendix .",
    "the life - time @xmath78 of a resonance is determined by the imaginary part of the resonant energy via @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the closer the resonant energy is to the real axis , the longer is the decay time .    for asymmetric scattering ,",
    "we find that the resonances are far away from the real axis , see fig .",
    "[ resonancesprd ] ( a ) . however , when both particles interact with the mirror , i.e.  @xmath80 , the resonances can be long - lived , see fig .",
    "[ resonancesprd ] ( b ) .",
    "the effect on the dynamics becomes apparent from the amplitude of the wavefunction at the mirror : for asymmetric scattering , the amplitude at the mirror vanishes immediately ( fig .",
    "[ dynamics ] ) whereas the decrease of the amplitude during symmetric scattering is much slower ( fig .  [ dynamicsdoubleprd ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ wavepacketsprd ] ( a ) , we show the amplitude for symmetric scattering at various times . even when the parameters of the model are choosen such that most of the bound system is reflected ( corresponding to a totally reflecting mirror ) , a part of the wave - function is trapped temporarily at the repulsive scattering potential , see fig .",

    "we assume that the potential matrix @xmath108 variies slowly such that we can neglect @xmath109 .",

    "otherwise one has exponential increasing or decreasing wkb - solutions .    in the following ,",
    "we limit our considerations to the modes @xmath112 and @xmath113 and assume a symmetric scattering process with @xmath114 .",

    "indeed , @xmath106 has one local minimum whereas @xmath107 has two local minima , see fig .",
    "[ potentials ] .",
    "if the scattering potential is much larger than the internal level spacing , @xmath122 , the potentials can be approximated by @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the potential @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "[ potentials ] ( a ) ) , we find that the local minimum is too shallow to support a resonance . in contrary , the potential @xmath107 ( see fig .",
    "[ potentials ] ( a ) ) supports for @xmath122 two resonances which correspond to a symmetric and an anti - symmetric state .",
    "the energies are given by @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the value of the potential @xmath107 at the local minima and the stiffness , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the exponent @xmath128 determines the tunnel coupling between the minima and the exponent @xmath129 determines the decay rate of the resonance .",
    "we have shown with a simple model that resonances can occur in the scattering process of a composite system . in particular",
    "we studied the splitting of a wave - packet by a potential which mimics a partially silvered mirror .",
    "depending on the particular system - mirror we found long - living and short - living resonances . if both particles interact with the mirror , it is possible that the composite system is trapped at the mirror for a finite time .",
    "we want to emphasize that these resonances occur due to the interaction between a purely _ repulsive _ potential ( mirror ) and the internal attractive potential .",
    "in contrast , resonances and even bound states would not be surprising for an attractive mirror potential .",
    "when internal degrees of freedom become excited during the scattering process , partial which - path - information can be obtained since the modes of the reflected and the transmitted wave - packet are populated differently .",
    "our findings should be of importance in the context of state preparation of mesoscopic objects or double - slit experiments with composite systems .",
    "in particular , the excitations of internal degrees of freedom have to be taken into account when the superposition principle is tested on a macroscopic scale , e.g. with optical trapped microspheres @xcite .",
    "one of the authors ( f. q. ) would like to thank r.  froese , m.  choptuik for helpful comments .",
    "this work is supported by the templeton foundation ( grant number jtf 36838 ) and nserc .",
    "in the following we give a brief introduction into the method of complex scaling which allows to determine the position of resonances . resonances result from imposing outgoing boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions of a time - independent hamiltonian . for our discussion",
    ", we consider the hamiltonian of a particle which moves in a potential @xmath130 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath131 and the asymptotic form of a general solution to the time - independent schrdinger equation takes the form @xmath132 here we assumed that the potential vanishes for @xmath133 and @xmath3 is the asymptotic momentum of the particle .",
    "when the amplitude of the incoming wave , @xmath134 , vanishes at @xmath135 , the system exhibits a bound state ( for @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) or a resonance ( for @xmath136 and @xmath138 ) . the imaginary part of the corresponding energy , @xmath139 is the lifetime of the resonance .",
    "the complex wave vector is given by @xmath140 , where @xmath141 lies in the range @xmath142 for a resonant eigenfunction .",
    "asymptotically , the eigenfunctions adopt the form @xmath143 since the functions diverge for @xmath144 they are not eigenfunctions of an hermitian operator .",
    "complex scaling is based on a scaling transformation of the time - independent schrdinger equation such that the ( transformed ) resonant eigenfunction becomes square - integrable .",
    "then the resonant eigenenergies can be determined from an eigenvalue equation of the transformed ( non - hermitian ) hamiltonian .",
    "a general scaling operator is of the form @xmath145 and transforms a wave - function according to @xmath146 choosing @xmath147 , the coordinate is rotated into the complex plane . the hamiltonian is transformed according to @xmath148 where we assumed that the potential can be analytically continued into the complex plane .",
    "when the system has no energy threshold , the energies of the continuum states are @xmath149 .",
    "the states themselves are combinations of ingoing and outgoing waves , @xmath150 and will be transformed under complex scaling to @xmath151 the only solutions which do not diverge have the wave vectors @xmath152 .",
    "thus , the continuum energies are rotated into the complex plane according to @xmath153 .",
    "since we assumed that the system has no energy threshold , the branch point of the rotated continuum is the origin of the complex energy plane .",

    "it can be shown that @xmath76 is locally independent of @xmath74 although the corresponding transformed eigenfunction @xmath156 varies with @xmath74 .",
