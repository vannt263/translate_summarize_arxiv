    "the subject of multiple parton interactions has been enjoying a renewed interest over the last few years , driven by the need to understand the full spectrum of hadronic activity at the lhc .",
    "the large collision energy available at the lhc increases the probability of scattering of more than just one parton from each hadron .",
    "in particular , multiple scattering events with final state particles carrying relatively high transverse momentum should occur much more commonly than at the previously operating hadron colliders .",
    "such observations provide valuable information on the structure of the proton and the parton  parton correlations within .",
    "indeed , processes involving two hard scatterings in one hadron ",
    "hadron collision , the so  called double parton scattering ( dps ) , have been studied in the 4jet and the @xmath5 + 3jet channels by the afs  @xcite , ua2  @xcite , cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite experiments , and the presence of dps is now well established .    in order to measure double parton scattering , one needs to consider processes for which the single parton scattering ( sps ) background is low or possesses characteristics that allow for the signal to be extracted . to date ,",
    "phenomenological studies have focused on observation of dps in hadronic processes such as four jets  @xcite , @xmath6 pairs  @xcite , @xmath6 pair and two jets  @xcite , higgs and a gauge boson  @xcite , production of either photons  @xcite , @xmath7  @xcite or @xmath8 bosons  @xcite in association with jets , or purely lepton events such as double drell ",
    "yan  @xcite and same  sign w ",
    "pair production  @xcite .    in the environment of hadronic collisions ,",
    "purely leptonic signatures offer a clean probe of the underlying scattering mechanisms .",
    "a generic property of dps processes is that they are expected to peak strongly in the low transverse momentum ( @xmath9 ) , low @xmath10 phase space region , which is difficult to access with a typical central detector . in final states involving jets ,",
    "tagging and identifying low @xmath9 jets associated with the dps signal process is challenging due to the overwhelming qcd background .",
    "however multi  lepton , especially muon , final states are much cleaner , making triggering on multi lepton final states with low @xmath9 possible . in this paper",
    "we take advantage of the excellent low @xmath9 muon acceptance of the lhcb detector , which can go down to @xmath11 1 gev , and focus on four  muon final states that form two opposite  sign ( os ) muon pairs in this particular experiment .",
    "this should maximize the number of dps events observed .",
    "depending on the analysis cuts , in particular on the invariant mass of the os muon pairs , the dps signal could be dominated by double drell  yan ( ddy ) production or production of a quarkonium ( @xmath1 or @xmath12 ) pair , which then decay into four leptons .",
    "the possibility of observing dps in pair ",
    "production of quarkonia has been recently investigated in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .  @xcite we have argued that the recent measurement of double @xmath1 production by the lhcb experiment  @xcite could already indicate a significant contribution from dps .    while the production of double @xmath1 pairs benefits from a large cross section , the subprocess of ddy , dy production , is theoretically well understood .",
    "for this reason , double drell  yan production might be considered a standard ",
    "candle dps process and merits a more detailed investigation .",
    "moreover , the partons involved in these processes are different .",
    "dps double @xmath1 production is expected to be dominantly produced by four gluons , whereas for ddy , the initial states at leading order ( lo ) are two quark  anti  quark pairs .",
    "hence the correlations being probed are different . in this paper , we shall primarily focus on the prospect for observing dps through the ddy channel .",
    "we also comment on some characteristic differences between double @xmath1 and ddy production .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : process ] we discuss the dps signal and sps background to ddy production at the lhc .",
    "our method of performing calculations and cuts chosen to select the signal appropriate to the lhcb experiment are presented in section  [ sec : eventsim ] , where we also give the total rates for the processes of interest . in section [ sec : kinematics ] we address the differential distributions for the signal and background to the ddy process , followed by a discussion of differences between the ddy and double @xmath1 distributions in section [ sec : kinematics_jpsi ] , before concluding in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the dps signal process leading to the two os muon pair final state is assumed to come from two independent hard scatterings of the dy type .",
    "an example feynman diagram is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dpsfeyndiag ] .",
    "if we further assume that the longitudinal and the transverse components of the generalized double parton distribution functions can be factorised , and that there are no longitudinal momentum correlations between the partons in the same hadron , the dps ddy cross section factorizes into a product of two sps _ single _ dy cross sections .",
    "more precisely , the differential dps cross section @xmath13 is written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the hadronic and partonic single dy process respectively . in the above expressions",
    ", @xmath17 is the partonic centre  of  mass energy squared , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and longitudinal momentum fraction for parton with flavour @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the factorization scale .",
    "the single dy matrix element and phase space element are denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath25 captures all the information on the transverse structure of the proton .",
    "it is likely to be process and energy dependent , and is the main quantity that a dps experiment will aim to extract .",
    "however , for concreteness , we shall use @xmath26 @xmath27 , a value measured in the @xmath5 + 3jet study by the cdf experiment  @xcite .",
    ", was obtained by the corresponding d0 experiment@xcite . ]",
    "recently , questions have been raised  @xcite about to what extent this intuitive picture can be derived in perturbative qcd .",
    "in particular , the assumption of factorization between the longitudinal and transverse components of double parton distributions appears not to be strictly consistent with qcd .",
    "it leads to an appearance of the spurious term in the evolution equation for double parton distributions , describing correlations in longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath19 .",
    "however , in the current analysis we consider final states produced through dps with relatively low invariant masses , meaning the incoming partons have on average low longitudinal momentum . since at low @xmath28 the parton ",
    "parton correlations are expected to be negligible , using single parton distributions @xmath29 is likely to be a good approximation .",
    "example feynman diagrams for the sps production process of two os muon pairs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spsfeyndiag ] .",
    "they can be classified into two groups : the type diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spsfeyndiag]a ) , where both virtual photons are attached to the initial state quarks , and the type diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spsfeyndiag]b ) , where the quarks fuse into a @xmath30 before decaying into four muons via an additional @xmath30 . in our analysis",
    "we consider contributions from both types of diagrams , as opposed to a previous study  @xcite in which only the first type of diagrams is included .      as mentioned in the introduction , in order to observe the dps signal , the sps background has to be low , at least in some region of the phase space . in the case of two os muon pair final states , there is no particular reason why _ a priori _ the sps production rates should be suppressed , as opposed to , e.g. , the same ",
    "sign @xmath7pair production , where due to electromagnetic charge conservation the sps process can only occur at higher order in powers of ( gauge ) couplings than in dps . therefore in studying the final state with two os muon pairs , it is important to exploit different kinematical properties of the sps and dps final states .",
    "for the dps signal , given our independent hard scattering assumption , each of the two os muon pairs originating from the two @xmath30 will exhibit @xmath9 balancing at the parton level . the presence of initial state radiation ( isr ) will provide a non - zero @xmath9 to each of the @xmath30 .",
    "the independent scattering hypothesis then implies that the azimuthal angular separation between the two @xmath30s should be uniformly distributed . on the contrary , for the sps background",
    ", at the parton level the transverse momentum is generally only balanced among all four muons .",
    "an implication is that for the two combinatoric ways to form two os muon pairs , which we shall also call @xmath30 , both will lead to a configuration in which the two @xmath30s travel back  to  back in the transverse plane .",
    "however again this picture will be distorted in the presence of isr .",
    "these basic kinematic differences form the basis for identifying the presence of dps events in previous experimental studies .",
    "a number of variables , designed to exploit the different transverse plane behaviour for the dps and sps processes , have been introduced in the literature .",
    "we shall see that the impact of significant qcd radiation on the low invariant masses being considered will lead to significant deviation from the intuitive parton  level picture , making the usage of such pair wise balancing variables less effective in discriminating dps from sps events . on the other hand , variables are generally less sensitive to these effects .",
    "the absolute rapidity difference between two reconstructed @xmath1s was first proposed in @xcite as a method to extract dps from sps events .",
    "we shall see whether a similar strategy can be used for ddy by constructing a similar variable for the @xmath30s .",
    "another complication is that for ddy there is a two  fold ( combinatoric ) ambiguity in grouping the four muons into two os pairs .",
    "this ambiguity is absent for double @xmath1 , since the pairing must have @xmath31 invariant masses lying within a mass window close to the physical @xmath1 mass .",
    "this leads to a different set of cuts that must be applied to the ddy , which will result in different kinematical distributions .",
    "we shall discuss the impact of these effects in more detail in the following sections .",
    "so far , we have considered the irreducible sps background only . in the low mass region ,",
    "semi  leptonic decay of heavy quarks and hadron mis  identification can fake the signal , and are important sources of background .",
    "these backgrounds have been studied in lhcb in the context of single dy @xcite , and it was found that a multi  variate selection strategy based on the isolated nature of the muons produced in dy processes can be used to achieve purities of 95% down to @xmath32 gev .",
    "a similar method could presumably be used for ddy , however a detailed study is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we now discuss how the dps signal and sps background events are generated . the predictions for the dps signal",
    "are obtained using the multi  parton scattering model in @xcite , which allows for generation of two hard scatterings in every event .",
    "we use the following ( default ) @xmath33 definition : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "we use pdfs  @xcite , and set the factorization scale @xmath22 for both 2to2 single dy subprocesses at @xmath37 , which can be different for the two subprocesses in the same event .",
    "enables us to take higher order qcd effects into account in the parton shower . in principle",
    "can also include effects of intrinsic @xmath9smearing of incoming partons .",
    "however currently @xmath9smearing is applied only to the hard process . in order to provide intrinsic @xmath9smearings for _ both _ hard subprocesses , we switch off the default intrinsic gaussian @xmath9 functionality during event generation , and implement independent @xmath9 smearings to the two hard subprocesses using the same gaussian model . for illustration , the root ",
    "mean  square intrinsic @xmath9 in this model , @xmath38 , is set to a conservative value of 2 gev .",
    "the sps events with two os muon pairs are generated using the package @xcite . here the same @xmath33 definition as in the dps process is used .",
    "we include both and type diagrams , as discussed in section [ sec : process ] . in the low invariant mass region being considered in this analysis , it is sufficient to consider only the feynman diagrams with two @xmath30 , no diagrams with ( virtual ) @xmath8bosons are included . for consistency , in the experimental analysis , the contributions from processes involving @xmath8 s have to be eliminated .",
    "this can be achieved by imposing an upper cut on the invariant mass of the four muons , @xmath39 .",
    "such a cut is also useful in enhancing the signal  to  background ( s / b ) ratio , as the dps signal is expected to have comparatively low four  muon invariant mass .",
    "the factorization scale is set at @xmath37 , @xmath39 .",
    "the parton level events generated by are interfaced to for parton showering . as in the dps process",
    ", the pdfs are used and an intrinsic gaussian @xmath9 smearing is applied after event generation , with the parameter @xmath38 set to 2 gev .",
    "we now discuss event selection . for the muons to be observed in the lhcb detector , the pseudorapidity ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath9 of each muon has to obey :    * @xmath41 , * @xmath42 gev .",
    "apart from the muons coming from the decay of @xmath30 , the simulated events can also contain additional muons generated by the decay of hadrons formed in the hadronisation process . to be conservative , we select events with exactly four muons passing the above acceptance cuts , and that they form two os muon pairs . additionally , we request that the events correspond to processes with @xmath30 decaying into muon pairs by avoiding the low mass hadronic resonance and the @xmath8 resonance regions with the following cuts :    * @xmath43 gev for _ all _ four @xmath44 combinations , * @xmath45 gev .    note that the cut @xmath46 gev must apply to all @xmath31 combinations , instead of only two of them .",
    "this is because there are potentially dangerous backgrounds involving low mass hadronic resonances , for example @xmath1 .",
    "these resonances could lead to high invariant masses from _ mismatched _",
    "@xmath31 pairs , pairs that do not come from the decay of the same resonance .",
    "a cut on all @xmath31 pairs will however also apply to the _ true _ pairing , which of course has a low @xmath31 invariant mass , and reject the event as a result .",
    "furthermore , contributions from @xmath47 and its higher resonances @xmath48 and @xmath49 , when combined with other source of muons , can lead to two os muon pairs . the @xmath12 background can be suppressed by rejecting events with    * @xmath50 gev @xmath51 gev for _ any _ of the four @xmath44 combinations ,    where the mass window is obtained from the recently published result by lhcb on @xmath12 production  @xcite .",
    "we will refer to the cuts above as the set of for the ddy analysis .",
    "we assume 100% detection efficiency for an event passing the above cuts .",

    "our line of analysis follows the one of  @xcite , where we studied the double @xmath1 production at lhcb for a collision energy of 7 tev , we apply the same methods of calculations and the same parameter values as in  @xcite . as for the ddy analysis ,",
    "the set of single muon cut is given by :    * @xmath41 , * @xmath42 gev .",
    "the narrower range @xmath52 in the analysis of  @xcite was motivated by the cuts used by the lhcb collaboration in the first experimental analysis of double @xmath1 production  @xcite .",
    "out of the two combinatoric ways to form two os pairs , the combination with the two invariant masses closest to the physical @xmath1 masses is chosen .",
    "this requirement is sufficient to discriminate between the combinations , as the os muon pairs originate from @xmath1 resonances . in our event simulation",
    ", we do not include effects due to finite detector resolution . as for the ddy analysis , pdfs",
    "are used and 100% reconstruction and detection efficiency is assumed .",

    "the inclusion of the parton shower in our simulations may be considered as a possible first step towards predictions with higher order corrections taken into account .",
    "however , the shower evolution does not change the total event rate of the parton level , if integrated over the full phase space .",
    "therefore it is illustrative to consider the size of the next  to  leading ( nlo ) @xmath53factors for the total cross sections .    in the context of our calculations , the appropriate k ",
    "factor would be defined by the ratio of the total cross section at nlo calculated using nlo pdfs to the lo total cross section using nlo pdfs . for the @xmath54 process at 14 tev , calculations with the package  @xcite give , for the set of basic cuts considered here , @xmath55 .    for comparison ,",
    "the k  factor for _ single _ dy , defined in the same way as above , is @xmath56 , when the cross sections are calculated with invariant mass @xmath57 between 4 and 40 gev .",
    "this could indicate an enhanced s / b ratio if higher order effects were taken into account .",
    "based on the dps and sps rates quoted in tables [ tab : xsec_cuts_ddy ] and [ tab : xsec_cuts_djpsi ] , we see that the measurement of dps in four  muon final states will be more challenging for the ddy process , when compared to double @xmath1 production . in particular , the rates for dps ddy are of @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath59 at the 7 and 14 tev lhc respectively , with relatively low s / b ratios . however possible improvements could be made .",
    "for example , it might be possible to better understand the @xmath12 background by investigating the behaviour of the inclusive @xmath12 sample @xcite that contains an extra pair of muons when the are applied .",
    "we also recall that in our calculation we assume a fixed value for @xmath26 @xmath27",
    ". this value might be process and scale dependent , and as discussed in section [ sec : process ] is a parameter to be determined by experiment .",
    "therefore in the next section we will focus on studying kinematical distributions and investigate if further kinematical cuts can be introduced to improve the s / b ratio , as well as facilitating the extraction of @xmath25 .",
    "with luminosity of a few inverse femtobarn , the number of ddy events expected at the 7 tev lhc is likely to be too low .",
    "for this reason only results for the 14 tev lhc will be presented .",
    "in this section we study differential cross sections for the production of four  muon final states originating from a decay of two @xmath30 after the set of basic cuts has been applied . to see the effects of parton showering and intrinsic @xmath9 smearing , we present three sets of predictions for the sps and dps production mechanism :    * parton level only(labelled as in the plots ) , * parton level + parton shower(labelled ) , * parton level + parton shower + intrinsic @xmath9 smearing(labelled ) .    the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions for a single @xmath61 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddy_singlemu ] .",
    "we see that in the entire @xmath40 and @xmath9 range considered here , the sps background dominates over the dps signal .",
    "the @xmath40 distribution for the sps background is more central within the allowed @xmath40 range .",
    "this is because the four muons originate from a single hard process , and it is more likely for all of them to be within the @xmath40 acceptance if the four  muon system falls in the centre of this allowed region .",
    "the @xmath9 distributions of sps and dps muons peak at about the same value , with the sps distribution being slightly harder .",
    "apart from the dps @xmath9 distribution , we see that the other distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddy_singlemu ] are not sensitive to isr or intrinsic @xmath9 .",
    "next we study the separation of dps and sps events using their different kinematic behaviour in the transverse plane . as discussed in section [ sec : process ] , at parton level , provided that the @xmath31 pairs are grouped correctly , the vector @xmath9 sum of the two os pairs in a dps event will be balanced _ separately _ , @xmath62 .",
    "for the sps , such @xmath9 balancing is generally achieved only among all 4 muons , which implies that the @xmath63 of the two @xmath31 pairs will be opposite to each other , resulting in a back  to  back configuration in the transverse plane .",
    "these differences can in principle be used to distinguish the dps from the sps process .",
    "in addition , these can be used to find the @xmath31 pairing that corresponds to the actual dps process , and allow further analysis based on the kinematic properties of these pairs , the @xmath30 in our present context .    to select one of the two combinatoric ways to form two os muon pairs , we select the combination that minimises the following pair ",
    "wise balancing variable ( @xmath64 ) : s&&(+),0<s<1 [ eq : sdef ] for the dps signal , at parton level the correct pairing always leads to @xmath65 , while isr and intrinsic @xmath9 effects will distort the picture .",

    "unfortunately , radiation and intrinsic @xmath9 effects change the picture dramatically . while the @xmath64 distribution for the sps process gets modified in a relatively moderate way ,",
    "the additional gluon radiation in the dps process spoils the @xmath9 balance to a large extent , flattening and spreading the distribution up to high values of @xmath64 .",
    "this , of course , significantly decreases the power of the variable @xmath64 to discriminate between the sps and dps mechanisms . in fig .",

    "the former appears to be slightly more populated in the region with small @xmath66 and @xmath74 , whereas events of the latter tend to occupy the corner of large @xmath70 and small @xmath79 .    concluding , observing dps through four  muon final states from ddy scatterings seems to be a challenging task due to its low production rate , table  [ tab : xsec_cuts_ddy ] .",
    "although an excess of dps events could be observed in the low @xmath80 and @xmath75 regions , the studied differential distributions between the sps and dps event samples do not show kinematical differences that are striking enough to justify putting additional hard cuts ( perhaps with the exception of @xmath75 ) at the cost of further reducing the signal yield .    on the other hand , we see that in addition to @xmath80 and @xmath75 , variables such as @xmath64 , @xmath81 , @xmath79 or @xmath82 of the wrong muon  pairs also show moderate , non  trivial differences between the dps and sps components , and we are able to understand the origin of their different distributions .",
    "to fully utilize these differences , it would be more effective to apply the template method , as is done for example in the @xmath83j studies in cdf and d0 to extract the dps fraction .",
    "moreover , we see from the double differential distribution in fig .  [",
    "fig : ddy_scat ] that additional information can be obtained by simultaneously considering more than one kinematic quantity .",
    "as seen in section [ sec : eventsim ] , after applying sets of basic cuts the total cross sections for double @xmath1 production at lhcb are significantly higher than the equivalent cross sections for the ddy process .",
    "even more importantly the s / b ratio is also better .",
    "this makes double @xmath1 production an excellent candidate process to observe dps  @xcite .",
    "methods to study double @xmath1 and to extract the dps signal from the sps background have been discussed in some detail in  @xcite . here",
    "we extend this study by comparing the different properties between double @xmath1 and ddy in @xmath0 collisions at 14 tev .",
    "there are a few important differences between double @xmath1 and ddy .",
    "first , their production is initiated by different partons : while double @xmath1 production is driven by the gluon ",
    "gluon fusion process , both sps ddy and the single dy subprocess in dps ddy require , at lowest order , a quark and an antiquark .",
    "the longitudinal momentum densities of these partons are different , which would lead to different rapidity distributions for the @xmath31 pairs .",
    "different initial ",
    "state partons also affect the parton shower , and hence @xmath9 . however , the hard scales of the double @xmath1 and ddy are also different , which will in turn affect the amount of qcd radiation .",
    "the combined effect has an impact on @xmath9 as well as azimuthal angular separations in the transverse plane of the reconstructed objects . from these sources .",
    "]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : djpsi_vecptvecy ] we show the rapidity and @xmath81 distributions of the @xmath31 pairs from double @xmath1 production . here",
    "the invariant mass of a @xmath31 pair readily determines if they originate from a @xmath1 resonance or not , and hence there is no ambiguity in pairing up the os muons . compared with ddy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ddy_vecptvecy]b ) , we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : djpsi_vecptvecy]a that both the double @xmath1 sps and dps are more central , with the effect of sps stronger .",
    "this is due to the smaller gluon densities at high parton @xmath28 compared to the light ( anti ) quarks , making high @xmath40 values for the @xmath31 pairs less likely . in fig .",
    "[ fig : djpsi_vecptvecy]b the impact of qcd radiation on @xmath81 is clearly seen , where the distribution including parton shower peaks slightly towards zero , instead of @xmath84 , the parton level result .",
    "this should be compared with the corresponding figure for ddy , fig .",
    "[ fig : ddy_vecdphivecdeta]a , which shows a milder radiation effect .",
    "a consequence of the well defined way to pair up the os muons is that it is not necessary to introduce the variable @xmath64 as a way to group the muons , although it could still be used to help distinguish the sps and dps components . since for the sps ddy process the pairing according to value of @xmath64 does not correspond to finding two @xmath61 s from a decay of the same @xmath30 , more significant differences between ddy and double @xmath1 are expected for the sps background .    the four  muon invariant mass distribution for double @xmath1 production is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : djpsi_4mu]a . the dps component peaks at higher value of @xmath75 than the sps component .",
    "the reverse is observed for ddy , fig .",
    "[ fig : ddy_4mu]a .",
    "this can partly be attributed to the @xmath31 invariant mass cut applied in the ddy analysis , which will tend to push the sps @xmath75 distribution towards higher values .",
    "of course there is no equivalent mass cut in the @xmath1 study , since there is no ambiguity in pairing up the muons .",
    "a quantity related to @xmath75 is @xmath79 , as in the centre of mass frame , a larger @xmath75 will implies a larger @xmath79 given a fixed @xmath85 .",
    "this distribution is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : djpsi_4mu]b .",
    "the observation for double @xmath1 of a more steeply falling @xmath74 for the sps is consistent with the more steeply falling @xmath75 . for ddy",
    ", the broader sps @xmath75 distribution implies that @xmath74 would be more slowly falling , thus making @xmath74 less effective as a variable to extract dps from sps component in ddy .    finally , we note that overall our current studies reinforce the statements made in  @xcite regarding the importance of radiation and intrinsic @xmath9 smearing effects for the observables involving quantities measured in the transverse plane . at the same time , we confirm the relative insensitivity to these effects on the variables measuring correlations in the longitudinal direction",
    ". therefore it could be beneficial to investigate in more detail how may be used to facilitate other dps searches in the future .",
    "measurements undertaken at the lhc will be crucial for improving the theoretical description of multiple parton scattering . in this paper",
    "we have studied the production of two os muon pairs via two hard scatterings of the dy type .",
    "dy production is considered a standard candle process at hadron colliders .",
    "the leptonic final states provide very clean experimental signatures , while the status of theoretical predictions is under control .",
    "all this makes the production of two os muon  pairs a model candidate process for probing the nature of dps .",
    "depending on the invariant mass of the os muon pairs , they may originate either from continuum ( @xmath30 ) or a hadronic resonance , @xmath1 .",
    "in the course of our study , we have found that at 7 tev , the ddy cross section and luminosity are too low for this process to be observed with the lhcb detector .",
    "the prospects for observing ddy should improve at 14 tev lhc given the increases in cross section , s / b ratio and luminosity .",
    "on the other hand , the production of the same final state through a double @xmath1 process possesses characteristics which should allow a measurement of dps at the lhcb in @xmath0 collisions at both 7 and 14 tev .",
    "however , we stress that these two processes are sensitive to different initial state partons ( ( anti)quark(anti)quark for ddy and gluon  gluon for double @xmath1 ) .",
    "hence they probe different correlation effects and provide complementary input to double parton distributions .    for the same reason",
    ", it might prove valuable to additionally investigate four muon final states where one muon pair comes from a decay of @xmath30 while the second originates from the decay of a low  mass resonance , @xmath1 .",
    "the cross section for such a process might be expected to lie between double @xmath1 and ddy , and hence is likely to be observable .",
    "furthermore , although in this paper we have concentrated on pairs of @xmath1 s as resonant sources of four  muon final states at low invariant masses , another promising opportunity to study dps can be offered by studying higher mass resonances , in particular involving @xmath12 production .",
    "for example , measurement of @xmath25 for both double @xmath1 and double @xmath12 processes could provide information on the scale dependence of the two  gluon parton distribution function .",
    "this would complement well the study of scale dependence that could be performed in @xmath86j , @xmath87 and other jet  based signatures proposed for the general purpose detectors atlas and cms @xcite",
    ".    upon completion of this paper , a suggestion to study double @xmath12 has been put forward in  @xcite .",
