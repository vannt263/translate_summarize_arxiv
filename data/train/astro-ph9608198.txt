    "three decades after their first identification ( schmidt 1963 ) more than 7000 quasars have been found ( hewitt & burbidge 1993 ) .",
    "quasar spectra play a key role in observational cosmology .",
    "most of them have been obtained with ground  based telescopes using various techniques , including wide  field prism surveys and spectroscopy at very high resolution . despite differences in detail between individual objects , quasar spectra bear a strong family resemblance , including features such as a non  thermal power ",
    "law continuum , a uv excess , and broad emission lines .",
    "one way to study the general properties of quasars is by co  adding the spectra of a number of quasars .",
    "the first composite spectrum included only 14 quasars ( baldwin 1977@xmath15 ) , while the latest ones ( boyle 1990 ; francis et  al .",
    "1991 ) were made from several hundred optical spectra .",
    "high s / n composite spectra serve as a good reference for the intrinsic continuum shape and emission lines of quasars in the wavelength region longward of 1200    ( in the quasar rest frame , and the same hereafter unless stated otherwise ) . ground ",
    "based telescopes can not , however , reveal the far  uv spectral region below 1200    for quasars with @xmath16 .",
    "several space  borne telescopes have filled this observational gap and further extended the observations of quasars to the extreme  ultraviolet ( euv ) region . as of 1995 december , the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) database contains more than 1500 low  resolution ( @xmath17 ) spectra of 158 quasars .",
    "an extensive iue  based study of the quasar continuum was carried out by obrien , gondhalekar , & wilson ( 1988 , ogw hereafter ) . using @xmath18 iue spectra of 59 quasars plus some data from ground  based observations",
    ", they found a considerable and gradual steepening of the continuum toward shorter wavelengths . the power ",
    "law index increases by @xmath19 from @xmath20 to @xmath21   .",
    "they derived an average power ",
    "law index ( @xmath22 ) of @xmath23 between 1216    and 1900    and @xmath24 between 800    and 1216   .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has greatly extended our probe of the distant universe .",
    "the hst faint object spectrograph ( fos ) database is superior to the iue database in terms of s / n level and spectral resolution ( typically @xmath25 ) .",
    "more than 800 fos spectra of 246 quasars have been archived as of the end of 1995 .",
    "the average redshift of quasars in the fos database is significantly higher than in the iue database .",
    "the spectral properties of some low  redshift quasars have been reported as part of the hst key project `` quasar absorption lines '' ( bahcall et  al .",
    "1993 ; laor et  al .  1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "we therefore focused on the fos archival data for quasars of higher redshift , in an attempt to study the sub ",
    "ly@xmath5  region in quasar spectra .",
    "we have constructed a composite spectrum of quasars , based on 284 fos spectra of 101 quasars .",
    "it covers a range between 350    and 3000    and reveals some features which are not seen in individual spectra . in particular , we find that the far  uv continuum slope is significantly different above and below @xmath13   .",
    "archival fos spectra were retrieved from the space telescope science institute in the form of calibrated data .",
    "the selection criteria were ( 1 ) target redshift @xmath26 ; and ( 2 ) no obvious broad absorption lines . the low ",
    "redshift limit was set so that the intrinsic spectral region shortward of 912    is accessible with hst .",
    "our sample includes 55 spectra with grating g160l , 29 with g130h , 93 with g190h , 90 with g270h , and 17 with g400h .",
    "the g160l and g130h spectra were checked for proper background subtraction and reprocessed if necessary .",
    "we measured the average count level at the wavelengths below 1150    where the instrumental sensitivity should be zero , and used it to correct the background subtraction .",
    "the distribution of the sample with redshift is displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "about 90% of our sample have @xmath4 . in this redshift range ,",
    "the correction for ly@xmath5  forest  line absorption is small ( @xmath27 ) . despite their small number ,",
    "the spectra of @xmath28 quasars are important as they reveal the waveband shortward of 600   . in these quasars ,",
    "numerous ly@xmath5forest and metal absorption lines significantly alter the intrinsic spectra .",
    "the selected fos spectra were corrected for galactic extinction . the hydrogen column density toward each quasar",
    "was estimated using the task colden of the einstein on  line service , smithsonian astrophysical observatory , which is based on the work of stark et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) . for several southern objects ,",
    "the column densities were interpolated from the results of heiles & cleary ( 1979 ) .",
    "the @xmath29 values were calculated using the formulation of burstein & heiles ( 1978 ) .",
    "we used the seaton curve ( seaton 1979 ) to correct for extinction .",
    "the spectra were then shifted to the objects rest frame .",
    "data points in the windows near the significant airglow lines at 1216  and 1304    in the observer s frame were replaced by values linearly interpolated from neighboring parts of the spectrum . if a spectrum contained an obvious flux discontinuity due to absorption by an external lyman ",
    "limit system , only the undepressed portion of the spectrum was used .",
    "every spectrum has been visually checked for cosmic ",
    "ray spikes , damped ly@xmath5  absorption lines , or densely clustered absorption lines .",
    "the data points affected by these abnormal features were not used in the combining process .    in the quasar rest frame , each spectrum was resampled with 0.1    bins , roughly corresponding to the rest ",
    "frame bin size of the original g130h pixels in the highest redshift quasars .",
    "if a new bin is entirely inside an old bin , the flux of the new bin is taken from the old one .",
    "however , if the new bin overlaps two of the old bins , then the flux is taken as the weighted mean of the fluxes from the two old bins .",
    "the error was treated in the same way , along with two additional factors : ( 1 ) the weighted mean was calculated using the weighting @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the error , and ( 2 ) the error was multiplied by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the original data pixel in units of  .",
    "while this propagates the magnitude of errors correctly , the rebinning process does introduce correlated errors between adjacent pixels that we do not track .",
    "the euv continuum of high  redshift quasars is unavoidably depressed by the lyman  line absorption and the lyman continuum absorption of intervening clouds .",
    "the accumulated absorption produces a trough centered around 700   , commonly referred to as the lyman valley ( mller & jakobsen 1990 ) .",
    "the exact shape of the lyman valley depends on the number of absorption lines and their distribution .",
    "we generated correction curves using the empirical formula for the forest  line distribution , i.e. @xmath34 ( press & rybicki 1993 ) .",
    "for @xmath35 we chose @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 because , with these parameter values , we were able to produce a line number comparable to that in the recently published data for high  redshift quasars ( hu et  al.1995 ) . at lower redshifts ( @xmath39 ) ,",
    "kulkarni & fall ( 1993 ) found @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . since these two sets of parameters yield a negligible difference in the average opacity at low redshifts , we used only the parameters derived at @xmath35 .    using the formulation for the average line  absorption opacity @xmath43 where @xmath44 is",
    "the number of lines per unit redshift and @xmath45 is the mean rest ",
    "frame equivalent width of ly@xmath5  lines averaged over the assumed distribution in column density ( mller & jakobsen 1990 ) , we calculated the wavelength ",
    "averaged opacity produced by lyman - series lines up to level 50 .",
    "the accumulated lyman ",
    "continuum absorption was calculated using @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the neutral hydrogen column density and @xmath48 is the hydrogen photoionization cross section at the lyman ",
    "limit wavelength @xmath49 .",
    "we produced a set of correction curves at different redshifts for lines with column density between @xmath50 and @xmath51  @xmath52 .",
    "the low limit was set by the recent keck spectroscopic observations ( hu et  al.1995 ) .",
    "absorption by any cloud with column density greater than @xmath51  @xmath52produces a noticeable lyman ",
    "limit edge in a spectrum , and its correction is straightforward . fig .",
    "2 displays correction curves at different redshifts and clearly shows that the correction is small ( @xmath27 ) for @xmath4 .",
    "we first applied a general correction for every merging spectrum . for quasars with @xmath6 ,",
    "if the absorbers with column density @xmath53  @xmath52  are known in the literature , we applied additional corrections for them .    to merge the quasar spectra we used a technique similar to that described by francis et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) . we sorted the quasar spectra by their wavelength coverages .",
    "starting from the quasar spectrum that covers the longest wavelengths , we normalized the flux of the second spectrum to the first so that the average flux of the two spectra matched each other in the overlapping region .",
    "to assure that the normalization applied to the continuum only , wavelength windows surrounding major emission lines were excluded . using this new summed spectrum ,",
    "the next spectrum was normalized and merged .",
    "this process was repeated to include more spectra , until the spectrum that covers the shortest wavelengths was included .",
    "we also practiced this method starting at the shortest wavelength end and found that the overall continuum and emission ",
    "line features were virtually identical .",
    "however , the summation from longer wavelengths is preferred , as it follows the direction from high to low s / n level at shorter wavelengths .    throughout the combining process the weighted mean and the error in the weighted mean were calculated at each 0.1    pixel .",
    "we tried a weight @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the flux and @xmath31 the error .",
    "with such a weighting a flux spectrum would be converted into an approximate count spectrum .",
    "such a summation resembled the addition of raw count spectra and produced an output with the highest possible s / n level ( with a peak value of @xmath56 per  ) .",
    "however , a small number of high  quality spectra were given particularly high weights so that the final spectrum bears the signature of strong absorption lines in these few quasars .",
    "we have , therefore , chosen a uniform weight in order to produce a smoother spectrum , particularly at shorter wavelengths , more representative of the overall quasar population . for every data point of every merged spectrum ,",
    "the average s / n level was calculated over 10 points ( 1.0   ) on either side . if the average s / n level per pixel was below 0.3 this data point was excluded .    using this composite spectrum as a template",
    ", we further applied a renormalization process .",
    "all the spectra were normalized so that the average flux level in individual spectra , excluding the wavelength windows surrounding major emission lines and the data points with average s",
    "/ n level less than 0.3 , matched that of the template spectrum in the corresponding wavelength range .",
    "the sum of the normalized spectra was smoother than the template at shorter wavelengths where the s / n level was lower , and it serves as the final composite spectrum .",
    "3 displays the number of merged spectra as a function of wavelength .",
    "for some objects , multiple observations taken with the same grating exist . in such cases , we merged these spectra into a single spectrum , which counts as one in fig .  3 .",
    "near 1200    the number of merged spectra reaches a peak of @xmath57 , and at very short wavelengths it is only 2 or 3 .",
    "4 displays the s / n level of the composite spectrum after binning by 10 pixels . the spectral region near 1200    has the highest s / n level of @xmath1 per  , and the region near 350    has @xmath58 per  .",
    "the actual s / n level may be slightly lower as the flat field correction of the fos instrument limits the s / n in any given spectrum to @xmath14 or less .",
    "but we do not expect a significant effect as any flat  field irregularities should be smeared out due to the different redshifts .",
    "the composite hst quasar spectrum , as shown in fig .",
    "5 , shows a change in slope of the continuum between 350    and 3000  that can be approximated as a broken power law .",
    "we used the iraf task specfit ( kriss 1994 ) to fit the shape of the continuum and the emission lines .",
    "with specfit , complex line and continuum models can be fitted to data using a nonlinear @xmath59-minimization technique . for our fits",
    "we binned the composite spectrum by three pixels ( 0.3   ) .",
    "the following wavelength windows for the continuum fitting were selected : 350450 , 500640 , 720750 , 800825 , 930950 , 11001130 , 14501470 , 19752010 , 21502200   . above 900    any small deviations from a power law that are due to weak emission features , fe  ii in particular , yield significant @xmath60 because of the very high s / n level .",
    "therefore , the selected windows at long wavelengths are narrow .",
    "the region near 912    was excluded because of an apparent local depression in flux ( discussed below ) .",
    "the region longward of 2200    was not fitted because of the strong fe  ii emission seen there .",
    "since the propagated error arrays in our calculations contain correlated errors that are not taken into account , we experimented with two different methods of assigning errors and evaluating the goodness of our fits .",
    "the first directly uses the propagated error array .",
    "the second uses the root - mean - square ( rms ) spectrum .",
    "an advantage of using the rms spectrum for the error bars is that it avoids giving excessive weight to the longer - wavelength portions of the spectrum where the number of merging spectra is large . to calculate the rms spectrum ,",
    "each normalized spectrum was differenced with respect to the composite .",
    "the squared differences were summed , with equal weights , and the sum was divided by the number of spectra contributing to each pixel . the square root of the result gives the rms deviation , shown in fig .",
    "the dispersion is @xmath12 around 2500   , and @xmath61 around 400   .",
    "a fit with a single power law continuum using the propagated error array yields @xmath62 for 1504 data points and 2 free parameters .",
    "in contrast , a broken power law gives @xmath63 for 1504 points and 4 free parameters , with the power ",
    "law index @xmath64 above 1038    and @xmath65 below .",
    "we conclude that a broken power law is a good fit to the continuum ( except for the region between 900    and 1200    where the continuum shape changes gradually ) , and a single power law can be excluded at much greater than the @xmath66 confidence level .",
    "fits using the rms spectrum for the errors give similar results .",
    "the fitted power ",
    "law index @xmath67 above @xmath68    and @xmath69 below .",
    "the power ",
    "law index in the region with @xmath70    derived with the rms array is the same as that with the propagated error array , and it is slightly different for @xmath71   . therefore the power ",
    "law indices in table  1 are not affected significantly by the use of different error arrays , and we feel that using the rms array may yield more representative results at shorter wavelengths .",
    "note that the @xmath72 errors only reflect the formal estimates of the fitting process , and the actual errors are somewhat higher because of the uncertainties introduced in the merging process .",
    "the break point of the power law is @xmath73   .",
    "this value is sensitive to the fitting windows chosen at shorter wavelengths , and may vary by @xmath14   . the continuum fit parameters are summarized in table  1 .",
    "separate fits were also performed for radio  loud and radio  quiet quasars , and these results are also given in table  1 and discussed below .",
    "as one can see in fig .  5 , one power law can describe well the wavelengths between 1300    and 3000   , despite the presence of fe  ii emission .",
    "the spectral region near the lyman limit is of special interest .",
    "we plot this region in fig .  7 with a pixel size of 0.3   . with respect to",
    "the fitted broken power ",
    "law continuum , there is a @xmath12 trough just below the lyman limit .",
    "the trough is a smooth feature centered around 870   , with a wavelength span of @xmath74   .",
    "it does not seem to arise from associated absorbers because it recovers much faster at shorter wavelengths than a @xmath75 law predicts .",
    "if included in the fit , this trough contributes substantially to @xmath59 as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "our fits to a comptonized accretion disk spectrum , discussed in  4.4 , address the statistical significance of the trough in more detail .",
    "such a trough is seen in the merged spectra made of several subsamples and therefore is not an artifact due to a few individual quasars .",
    "there are several spectra that show significant broad absorption features near the lyman limit , and they will be discussed in a separate paper ( zheng et  al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we used multiple gaussian components to fit the emission lines using specfit .",
    "ly@xmath5 , c  iv , o  vi , n  v  and mg  ii were fitted with two gaussians : a narrow component and a broad one .",
    "the line widths of the two n  vcomponents were tied to the respective ly@xmath5  components , and the n  v / ly@xmath5  wavelength ratio was fixed at its rest  frame value .",
    "other lines were modeled with one gaussian .",
    "the line widths of al  iii , si  iii ] and c  iii ] were tied together in the fitting process .",
    "the fitting results are listed in table  2 .",
    "the flux units are arbitrary on a relative scale with i(ly@xmath5 ) = 100 .",
    "in addition to the major emission features marked in fig .  5 , some weak features , such as c  iii @xmath76977 and n  iii @xmath76991 , can be identified because of the high s / n level .",
    "the emission feature around 780    has been identified as ne  viii ( hamann , zuo , & tytler 1995 ) .",
    "the ionization level of ne  viii ( 206  ev ) is extremely high .",
    "if the line emission is generated by collisional excitation , a high temperature ( @xmath77  k ) is needed in the region in which these lines are formed as their excitation energies are greater than 12  ev .",
    "the ne  viii  profile , with a fwhm @xmath78  @xmath79 , is much broader than that of most other lines , and o  vi  emission also exhibits a broad base of similar width .",
    "the emission feature around 690    may be o  iii+n  iii arising from the bowen fluorescence effect ( eastman & macalpine 1985 ; netzer , elitzur , & ferland 1985 ) .",
    "the o@xmath80 and n@xmath80 ions have transitions whose wavelengths coincide very closely with he  ii  @xmath76304   , which was recently detected in a high  z quasar ( davidsen , kriss , & zheng 1996@xmath15 ) .",
    "abundant he  ii  ly@xmath5  photons in the line  emitting region can excite the o@xmath80 and n@xmath80 ions and produce cascade transitions .",
    "theoretical estimates suggest that the o  iii / he  ii  ly@xmath5intensity ratio is on the order of 0.1 and is only weakly dependent on the ionizing flux .",
    "this feature is not present in every spectrum that covers the wavelengths between 650    and 700   , so its identification is only suggestive .",
    "there is also an emission feature near 833   .",
    "we tentatively identify it as o  ii @xmath76833.80 , while an alternative identification as o  iii @xmath76833.97 is also possible . at wavelengths shorter than 600",
    "we did not attempt to identify emission features because of the limited s / n level .",
    "the continuum shape above 600    can be determined quite accurately , because the spectrum is composed of mainly @xmath4 quasars and the lyman ",
    "valley correction is small .",
    "below 600   , the merged spectra are mainly derived from @xmath6 quasars , and the results depend more and more on the correction as the redshift increases .",
    "the correction curves applied are based on equation ( 1 ) , which is statistical in nature .",
    "our monte  carlo simulations of forest  line absorption ( with column density @xmath81  @xmath52 ) suggest fluctuations of @xmath12 in the average decrements .",
    "we find that the actual average line opacity , due to line blending , is @xmath82 smaller ( for @xmath83 ) than equation ( 2 ) indicates . as lines with higher column density contribute more significantly in the wavelengths around 700   , the correction for lines between @xmath51 and @xmath84  @xmath52introduces larger errors .",
    "our calculations show that , at @xmath85 , absorption lines with @xmath86  @xmath52  may affect the decrement at 350    and lead to an uncertainty in the power ",
    "law index between 350    and 1050    of @xmath87 .",
    "however , such a large error is unlikely because an absorption line with @xmath88  @xmath52  should produce a visible lyman ",
    "limit edge , and our selection process has carefully excluded the wavelength regions shortward of such visible edges . combining all these facts together , we feel that an uncertainty of 0.15 in the power  law index may be a reasonable estimate between 350    and 1050   . at wavelengths above 1050   ,",
    "a comparison between different quasar subsamples yields a dispersion in @xmath5 of @xmath89 .",
    "our measurements of the quasar continuum can be compared with earlier iue results .",
    "ogw ( 1988 ) found the continuum steepening toward shorter wavelengths .",
    "excluding blazars and broad  absorption  line quasars , their power  law indices are @xmath90 for @xmath91   , @xmath92 for @xmath93   , and @xmath94 for @xmath95   .",
    "the far  uv power ",
    "law index they derived is somewhat steeper than our result of @xmath96 .",
    "their subsample with @xmath97 yielded even steeper values at shorter wavelengths , i.e. @xmath98 for @xmath91   , @xmath99 for @xmath93   , and @xmath100 for @xmath101   .",
    "the ogw results are in qualitative agreement with ours , but our larger sample and more sensitive hst observations more accurately determine the power  law index .",
    "ogw ( 1988 ) suggested that the steepening is gradual from the optical to the uv .",
    "we find that the continuum between @xmath2    and 3000    can be approximated with one power law .    at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "obrien ( 1987 ) used the iue spectra of three radio  quiet quasars to derive a mean power  law index of @xmath102 between 600    and 912   .",
    "our more precise measurement , while consistent with his result , suggests that for our total sample the quasar continuum in this spectral region is actually slightly steeper . for our radio  quiet subsample , however , we find @xmath5 very similar to obrien s value , but with a considerably smaller uncertainty .",
    "euv photons play important roles in many physical processes , and knowledge of the quasar euv continuum shape would lead to improvements in many theoretical models .",
    "emission lines in active galaxies and quasars are believed to be powered by photoionization .",
    "models with various euv continuum shapes yield different line intensities ( krolik & kallman 1988 ) . a typical agn power  law index adopted for the euv band is @xmath103 ( mathews & ferland 1987 ) which predicts too strong an ionizing continuum compared to our result of @xmath96 .",
    "our composite spectrum , with a power  law extrapolation into the soft  x  ray band , can serve as a reasonable input for photoionization models in the study of agn .",
    "quasar radiation plays a key role in the reionization of the intergalactic medium in the early universe ( e.g. , shapiro , giroux , & babul 1994 ) . the exact quasar continuum shape ( miralda  escude & ostriker 1990 ) may dictate the he  ii  ionizing metagalactic radiation field , which in turn affects the he  ii  opacity in the intergalactic medium .",
    "the recent measurement of the he  ii  opacity ( davidsen et  al .",
    "1996@xmath15 ) in the intergalactic medium is compatible with a background radiation field with @xmath104 ( davidsen et  al .",
    "1996@xmath105 ) .",
    "this is very similar to the value found here for radio  quiet quasars , which should dominate the metagalactic background radiation .",
    "the continuum shape of quasars also affects their detectability at high redshifts .",
    "an order of magnitude fewer quasars are predicted to be observable in the uv band if their euv continuum power law index is @xmath106 compared with @xmath107 ( pickard & jakobsen 1993 ) .",
    "we divided our sample into radio  loud and radio  quiet objects and applied the same fitting process to the lines and the continuum .",
    "loud quasars are defined as those with the logarithm of the ratio of the 6 cm flux to the flux in the optical b band @xmath108 . to evaluate @xmath109",
    ", we used fluxes for the selected quasars from vron - cetty & vron ( 1993 ) .",
    "the composite spectra of radio  loud and radio  quiet quasars are compared in fig .",
    "8 . both composite spectra cover a similar wavelength range and exhibit similar spectral properties . at very short wavelengths the composite spectrum of radio ",
    "loud quasars is entirely due to two objects : q04462049 between approximately 475    and 600   , and oq  172 below 475   , so the result is quite uncertain at these wavelengths .    for radio",
    " loud quasars , the fitted power ",
    "law index @xmath110 above 1050    and @xmath111 below . for radio",
    " quiet quasars , it is @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "our results are in agreement with christiani & vio ( 1990 ) in terms of the similar continuum shape between 1000    and 3000    for their subsamples of radio  selected and optically  selected quasars .",
    "below 1000   , the continuum of radio  loud quasars appears to be steeper than that of radio  quiet quasars .",
    "such a difference was also noticed by ogw ( 1988 ) in their radio  selected and optically  or  x  ray selected samples .    for radio",
    " quiet quasars , the mg  ii intensity is stronger , and the intensities of c  iv  and o  vi  are weaker . radio ",
    "quiet and radio  loud quasars therefore appear to show somewhat different ionization levels of their emission lines . to check whether this is a luminosity effect , we compared the mean redshift of the subsamples .",
    "as shown in table  1 , these two groups of quasars have similar mean redshifts .",
    "we also calculated the quasar specific luminosity at 1000   , assuming @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "if a spectrum does not cover 1000   , the flux was extrapolated from that at the wavelengths closest to 1000   , using the power law derived from the whole sample ( table  1 ) .",
    "the mean luminosities of the radio  loud and radio  quiet quasars are both @xmath116 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the differences seen are not due to a luminosity effect .",
    "9 plots our composite spectrum for radio  quiet quasars and the spectrum of francis et  al .",

    "this result supports the finding of ogw ( 1988 ) that quasars of higher redshift show harder uv continua .",
    "francis ( 1993 ) further confirmed that the effect is a correlation with redshift and not with luminosity .    by comparing the two composite spectra in fig .",
    "one can also see that the intensities of several high  ionization emission lines are different .",

    "the equivalent widths of low  ionization lines , such as mg  ii , c  iii ] , o  i and si  iv remain basically unchanged .",
    "the trend that ly@xmath5  and high  ionization lines exhibit significant decreases toward higher redshifts ( and , consequently , higher luminosities : the baldwin effect , baldwin 1977b ) supports the hypothesis that the baldwin effect is due to a luminosity dependence of the shape of the ionizing continuum ( zheng , fang , & binette 1992 ) , i.e. the continuum shape above @xmath14  ev may be steeper at higher luminosities .      the flux discontinuity at the lyman limit of 912   is a critical test of the nature of the uv excess in agn .",
    "the rising continuum in the optical  uv band resembles the thermal spectrum of an accretion disk ( shields 1978 ; malkan & sargent 1982 ) .",
    "such a disk , with a characteristic temperature of @xmath122  k , should produce a significant absorption edge at the lyman limit ( kolykhalov & sunyaev 1984 ) .",

    "limit region .",

    "limit discontinuity ( czerny & zbyszewska 1991 ) . the emergent spectrum still bears the signature of a lyman edge , however , if the optical depth to scattering is not too high .    to fit the overall continuum shape of our mean quasar spectrum , we computed an intrinsic disk spectrum in the schwarzschild metric that was a sum of blackbodies with an empirical lyman limit feature as described by lee , kriss , & davidsen ( 1992 ) .",
    "a spherical corona with optical depth @xmath125 to compton scattering was assumed to surround the disk .",
    "the comptonized disk spectrum was calculated using the formulation of czerny & zbyszewska ( 1991 ) as described by lee et  al .",
    "the shape of the intrinsic disk spectrum is invariant for a fixed ratio @xmath126 , and the spectral index of the comptonized high energy tail depends almost entirely on the compton @xmath127 parameter @xmath128 ( lee 1995 ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate determines the total luminosity , and this we normalized to the mean luminosity of the quasar sample .",
    "the location of the lyman - edge depends largely on the disk inclination , @xmath129 .",
    "thus the free parameters in the fit were the mass of the central black hole , @xmath130 , the mass accretion rate , @xmath131 , the temperature of the comptonizing medium , @xmath132 , the optical depth of the empirical lyman edge , @xmath133 , and the inclination of the disk normal to the line of sight , @xmath129 .",
    "our fits used the same continuum windows listed in  3.1 for the broken power - law continuum fits except that we also included the lyman edge region from 825930   that was excluded in those previous fits . for error bars we used the propagated errors computed in the merging process .",
    "we find that the best fit requires a lyman edge of modest optical depth in the emergent disk spectrum .",
    "the best fit has a lyman limit optical depth of @xmath134 and yields @xmath135 for 1853 points and 5 free parameters .",
    "@xmath136 results in a fit with @xmath137 , and this can be excluded at @xmath138 confidence relative to the fit with a lyman edge of finite optical depth .",
    "10 shows the best - fit comptonized accretion - disk spectrum compared to the 1-  resolution mean quasar spectrum .",
    "this model has @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath134 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142  k. for a schwarzschild black hole the total luminosity of the disk is @xmath143 , which is 5% of the eddington limit for a @xmath144 black hole .",
    "although an inclination closer to @xmath145 would have been expected for a sample of randomly oriented disks , we note that the heterogeneous hst archive sample is unlikely to be random .",
    "our exclusion of bal qsos is likely to avoid disks at high inclinations .",
    "the large fraction of radio - loud objects in the sample will also produce a bias towards low inclinations .",
    "the geometrically thin , optically thick  standard \" accretion disk model has been criticized on many counts ( e.g. , antonucci 1988 , 1992 ) . among its shortcomings",
    "are the lack of strong lyman ",
    "edge features in the observations , the difficulty of constructing disks with hot  enough tails to match the observed soft  x  ray excesses of agn , and observed polarization properties that are inconsistent with simple predictions .",
    "comptonization of the intrinsic disk spectrum in a quasi ",
    "spherical scatterer resolves many of these problems .",
    "as noted by czerny & zbyszewska ( 1991 ) , comptonization can broaden an intrinsic lyman edge and decrease its contrast to the point where a broad range of intrinsic disk parameters produce similar emergent spectra .",
    "the ability of such a model to match the weak lyman limit feature in our mean spectrum is illustrated by our fit in fig .",
    "obrien ( 1987 ) showed that an extrapolation of a @xmath146 power law may connect the uv intensity to the soft  x  ray flux level around 0.3 kev in many quasars .",
    "this implies that , if the euv continuum in our composite spectrum is representative , a single power law representing the high energy tail of a comptonized accretion ",
    "disk spectrum may bridge the gap between the far  uv and the soft  x  ray bands .",
    "a comptonized accretion disk fit to the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) spectrum of mrk  335 ( zheng et  al .",
    "1995 ) matches both the far  uv spectral shape in the lyman ",
    "limit region and the soft  x  ray excess observed with the broad band x  ray telescope ( turner et  al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "if the comptonizing medium has a largely spherical distribution , this can resolve many of the problems that recent polarization observations present for the thin disk model .",
    "simple disk models show a low polarization increasing to the blue with a large drop beyond the lyman limit due to the large absorption opacity of the lyman continuum ( laor , netzer , & piran 1990 ) .",
    "this predicted behavior is not observed in recent observations ( impey et  al .",
    "1995 ; koratkar et  al . 1995 ; antonucci et  al .",
    "1996 ) which generally show little or no polarization and occasionally a _ rise _ beyond the lyman limit rather than a drop .",
    "moreover , the polarization vectors tend to be parallel to the radio  jet axis rather than perpendicular as one would expect if the jet were oriented perpendicular to the disk .",
    "a more physically realistic treatment of the polarized radiative transfer in a thin disk atmosphere ( blaes & agol 1996 ) demonstrates that polarization can increase across the lyman limit as observed .",
    "if most of the intrinsic disk radiation is compton scattered , however , the polarization properties will be determined by the compton scattering medium , not the disk atmosphere .",
    "if the scatterer is spherical , the polarization will be low .",
    "antonucci et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) note that the polarization vector will lie parallel to the radio jet if the scatterer is slightly extended along the radio axis .",
    "this is perhaps not unexpected if a wind from the disk feeds the scattering region .",
    "although strong comptonization can obscure many of the intrinsic properties of the disk spectrum , it does not destroy them .",
    "the shape of the spectrum near the peak in @xmath147 and to the red is still determined predominantly by the black hole mass and the accretion rate .",
    "the position of any surviving lyman ",
    "edge feature depends on the disk inclination .",
    "the spectral index of the high energy tail is diagnostic of the optical depth and temperature in the comptonizing medium .",
    "given the strong suggestion that comptonization dominates the appearance of our composite hst spectrum , future disk models should take this feature explicitly into account .",
    "we have constructed a composite spectrum from 284 hst / fos spectra of 101 quasars with @xmath26 . the uv continuum in the composite quasar spectrum can be fitted with a broken power law with a break around 1050   . at longer wavelengths",
    "the power ",
    "law index is @xmath148 .",
    "the euv continuum can be fitted with a power law of @xmath149 without a noticeable turnover toward higher frequencies . near the lyman limit",
    "the continuum flux is depressed by @xmath12 relative to surrounding wavelengths .",
    "these features match the characteristics of thermal emission from an accretion disk with lyman  edge absorption that is modified by electron scattering , suggesting that the uv bump may be produced by a comptonized accretion ",
    "disk spectrum .",
    "the strengths of high  ionization emission lines show a significant luminosity dependence , probably due to evolution of the uv continuum shape .",
    "in contrast , the equivalent widths of low  ionization lines do not exhibit such a dependence , suggesting that the continuum evolution may take place mainly in the energy band above 50 ev .",
    "the euv continuum appears to be steeper in radio  loud quasars ( @xmath150 ) than it is in radio  quiet quasars ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "quiet quasars appear to show slightly lower ionization levels in their emission lines .",
