    "what is the structure of the transition zone between liquid and vapour ? in 1893 van der waals  @xcite described the liquid - vapour interface as a smooth density profile @xmath0 , shortly preceded by rayleigh  @xcite .",
    "early computational  @xcite and theoretical work based on the born - green - yvon equation  @xcite suggested a significant degree of surface layering in the lennard - jones model of simple liquids .",
    "however , further simulations  @xcite and density functional theory  @xcite showed that little surface layering is expected for materials based on van der waals interactions , and that the interfacial profile is dominated by a smooth change in density .",
    "relative to the critical temperature @xmath1 , metals typically remain liquid at rather lower temperatures than lennard - jones like materials , and here pronounced surface layering is indeed found @xcite . an important related problem to the free interface",
    "is the confinement introduced by a hard wall , crystal or similar external field , which may be tackled with density functional theory  @xcite , simulation  @xcite and experiment  @xcite . in this case , layering is more generally observed .    in experiments on conventional materials ,",
    "the measurement of ( intrinsic ) interfacial profiles is complicated by collective surface excitations in the form of capillary waves @xcite . for those systems where surface layering is pronounced such as metals ,",
    "the lengthscale above which capillary wave effects become dominant is around 100 nm .",
    "this lengthscale is larger than that typically encountered in computational studies , where capillary waves only cause a small broadening of surface layering  @xcite , but can not be neglected in experiment . nonetheless surface layering has been demonstrated in experiments , for example in liquid mercury  @xcite .",
    "a further class of materials which may be directly investigated in real space due to their mesoscopic lengthscale are colloidal suspensions .",
    "most notably , colloid - polymer mixtures exhibit ( colloidal ) vapour - liquid phase separation  @xcite , moreover the hard - sphere interactions that closely approximate such systems are amenable to theory  @xcite .",
    "here capillary waves have been directly visualised  @xcite .",
    "so far , to our knowledge , interfaces in colloidal systems with long - ranged interactions  @xcite which can be deeply cooled and might exhibit pronounced layering ( the equivalent of metals ) have not been studied .",
    "however , single - particle resolution enables other approaches to be used .",
    "notably , a method introduced by chacon and tarazona  @xcite which pins a plane to a layer of surface particles indeed revealed density oscillations perpendicular to the pinned surface in a colloidal liquid  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the perturbation induced by the interface on the liquid structure at the molecular / atomic level .",
    "we consider two different liquid systems .",
    "the first is a truncated and shifted lennard - jones ( lj ) liquid  @xcite whose triple temperature @xmath2 lies at @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the critical temperature . to observe a stronger effect of the liquid - gas interface",
    ", we also consider a model potential which approximates sodium ( na ) , whose triple point lies at a rather lower temperature relative to criticality of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this model is known to exhibit strong surface layering around the triple point , which is also seen in _ ab initio _",
    "simulations @xcite .    in the bulk",
    ", it is argued that liquid structure is determined to a significant degree by structures which are energetically locally favourable  @xcite .",
    "such locally favoured structures can correspond to clusters which minimise the potential energy in isolation and may be catalogued and ordered by the number of particles they contain  @xcite .",
    "structures which exhibit five - fold symmetry , in particular , are very common and account for up to 2/3 of all particles  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the local dynamics can be determined to a significant degree by the geometry and the symmetries of the locally favoured structures .",
    "this observation is potentially significant to understand the glassy behaviour of supercooled liquids : if the symmetry of the locally favoured structure differs from that of the crystalline state , the path to crystallization is frustrated .",
    "it is thus natural to ask what happens to the concentration of clusters near the liquid - gas interface",
    ". this will be a significant measure of local liquid structure .",
    "two mechanisms will contribute to a significant change in cluster concentration near the interface .",
    "first , structures favoured by the bulk may be suppressed near the free surface .",
    "second , clusters are non - isotropic , and might thus be ordered in a particular way with respect to the free surface .",
    "we will explore this ordering effect in the case of two very common clusters , following the nomenclature of doye _ et .",
    "@xcite : the 5a triangular bipyramid and 7a pentagonal bipyramid , which are 3-and 5-membered rings with atoms attached above and below the plane of the ring .",
    "one might think that the free surface could lead to an _ enhancement _ of local fivefold symmetry .",
    "the reason is that in the case of deeply quenched liquids , the free interface can to an extent be thought of as a constraining field .",
    "now the structure induced in simple liquids by confinement such as hard walls has been shown , under the application of a second field , to induce some five - fold symmetry @xcite , which may be conjectured to relate to x - ray reflectometry experiments on lead which found evidence for local fivefold symmetry at the interface @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , here our analysis suggests the opposite effect : 7a pentagonal bipyramid clusters , which form the basic unit of five - fold symmetry in our methodology  @xcite , are suppressed disproportionately near the interface .    to determine locally favoured structures",
    ", we use a novel method , the topological cluster classification ( tcc ) .",
    "this identifies small clusters of particles from within bulk phases which are topologically similar to a set of reference clusters  @xcite . in this case",
    "the reference structures are formed by groups of @xmath6 morse particles in isolation  @xcite and , depending on the range of the morse potential , correspond to the global energy minimum clusters of the lennard - jones and sodium potentials considered .",
    "we have recently explored the structure of the bulk lennard - jones liquid and a system similar to the sodium model using this method  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the suggestion of frank who conjectured that in the structure of such liquids 13-membered icosahedral structures might be prevalent , we found that these only account for one particle in a thousand , according to our criteria .",
    "instead five - fold symmetry stems from pentagonal bipyramids , which account for 54% of the particles at the lennard - jones triple point  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , we describe our methodology for identifying the interface , and local structure in section [ sec : methodology ] .",
    "we then proceed to present and discuss our findings in section [ sec : results ] before placing our findings in context in the concluding section [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "now the triple point of lennard - jones lies around @xmath14 , so the maximum degree of cooling relative to the critical point is @xmath15 .",
    "we would like to realize even lower temperatures and this can be achieved by employing models with longer - ranged interactions which freeze at lower temperatures relative to criticality . in particular , the spherically symmetric model for sodium ( na ) introduced by chacon _",

    "equilibration is ensured by both checking relaxation of the total potential energy and by examining the evolution of the liquid - vapour density profile @xmath59 .",
    "it has been shown that the coexistence densities and @xmath59 depend on the system size , the geometry of the box , and the boundary conditions of the simulation @xcite , as well as the truncation length and whether the potential is shifted @xcite .",

    "data offset for clarity .",
    "the sodium interface at the lowest temperature shows a very pronounced surface layering .",
    "the interfaces have all been centred at @xmath100.,width=302 ]    we begin our presentation of the results by showing the interfacial profiles of the different systems and state points . in fig .",
    "[ figprofiles ] we see that the interfacial width drops with decreasing @xmath101 . the lowest temperatures , and thus the smallest interfacial widths , are realized for the sodium system .",
    "we note the pronounced interfacial layering at the lowest temperature @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the effect of the interface on the local ordering of the liquid extends far into the bulk in that case .",
    "we now proceed to the tcc analysis of the lennard - jones liquid at two different temperatures .",
    "we plot the total density of particles @xmath0 as well as the particle densities @xmath102 for the most popular clusters .",
    "these are defined as the densities of all the particles belonging to a particular cluster .",
    "the densities are plotted on a logarithmic scale as a function of the distance @xmath42 from the interface in fig .",
    "[ figlennardjones ] .",
    "note that the liquid side only is plotted ( @xmath103 ) , and that , for lennard - jones , the density varies smoothly across the interface for our treatment @xcite .",
    "for each of the temperatures , we also plot the cluster densities _ relative _ to the total density on a linear scale .",
    "the relative density is then defined as the density of particles in a given cluster @xmath104 divided by the total density @xmath0 . in the bulk",
    "it is seen that the most popular clusters , including the 7a pentagonal bipyramid , account for more than half of all the particles .",
    "as one moves towards the interface , the relative density of clusters decreases . for the lennard - jones system",
    ", our analysis suggests that there is no enhancement of 5-fold symmetry at this interface .",
    "in fact , as all cluster populations drop with the reducing density at the interface , we argue that there is more of a reduction in 5-fold symmetry than anything else .",
    "in particular the 7a pentagonal bipyramid cluster may be taken as a rough proxy for five - membered rings , the basic unit of 5-fold symmetry .",
    "these clearly follow the density profile , although the increase with depth into the liquid is much more marked than the overall density .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn about the 13a icosahedron .",
    "the decrease in relative cluster density can be rationalized by observing that while potential energy considerations enhance cluster populations  @xcite , so too does packing  @xcite .",
    "thus we expect a decrease in cluster population at lower density , for example upon approach to the interface .",
    "for example , for both @xmath45 ( @xmath105 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath106 ) , the relative decrease in density amounts to a factor of two in the case of 7a pentagonal bipyramid clusters .",
    "since the change appears coupled to the overall density @xmath54 , we see further change in the structure of the liquid near the surface for the temperatures studied . note that although it would be attractive to investigate the effect of reducing the density on the cluster population in a bulk system of course this is not possible because the lennard - jones system would be unstable to vapour - liquid phase coexistence .    to gain more insight into the effect of the interface on the cluster population , it would therefore be desirable to make the effect of the interface more pronounced by going to lower temperatures , thus making the interface sharper [ for which we use the model sodium potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : na ] ) ] .",
    "note that the triple point in general has a rather higher population of clusters than does @xmath45 , which is not unreasonable , as in addition to the higher density the enhanced relative attractions at reduced temperature would be expected to promote clustering , which has been observed in the bulk @xcite .",
    "we next performed the same spatially resolved cluster analysis for sodium at lower temperatures relative to criticality .",
    "we confirmed that , at higher @xmath107 , the results with sodium were very similar to those for lennard - jones .",
    "as fig .  [ figprofiles ] has shown , the interface becomes narrower and at the lowest temperature there are oscillations of the bulk density profile indicating significant surface layering .",
    "this shows that the interface changes structuring into the liquid at longer ranges than in the case of lennard - jones .",
    "once more we first show the absolute densities for all the clusters on a logarithmic scale , and then the densities relative to the total on a linear scale ( fig .  [ figsodium ] ) .",
    "the latter are a direct measure of the influence of the interface on the local ordering . at the higher temperature ,",
    "the decrease in the relative cluster density is more pronounced than before , but still remains modest .",
    "we note that once more there is certainly no _ increase _ of 7a pentagonal bipyramid cluster concentration owing to orientational ordering near the interface .    at the lower temperature ,",
    "7a clusters account for 82% of the particles in the bulk , the relative density is reduced to 31% near the interface , a somewhat larger drop in population . however , in stark contrast to the higher temperature state points , the effect on cluster concentration extends far beyond the density decrease related to the interface , and into the bulk .",
    "this mirrors the layering as reflected in the oscillations of the density profile .",
    "the cluster concentrations are evidently a sensitive measure of the layering effect , and of the change in orientational order it introduces .",
    "by contrast , the relative decrease of the triangular bipyramidal 5a clusters is relatively mild .",
    "as the clusters are smaller , this might be expected , since the perturbation by the interface on the compact 5a structure will be smaller .",
    "other popular clusters , notably 6a octahedra and 8a @xmath108 also show a similar behaviour .",
    "to gain more insight into the concentration of 5a and 7a clusters , we consider their orientational ordering near the interface . as seen in figs .",
    "[ figtcc ] and  [ figorientation ] , both are viewed as a 3-membered and 5-membered ring , respectively , with two spindle particles sticking out in a direction perpendicular ( ignoring thermal fluctuations ) to the ring .",
    "we neglect the 6a octahedron due to its high symmetry .",
    "to measure the orientation of these structures relative to the interface , we consider the angle @xmath109 between the spindle particles and the normal to the plane . from this",
    "we can construct an order parameter @xmath110 which is zero in the bulk , where all orientations are equal , unity in the case that all clusters are aligned with the axis perpendicular to the interface and @xmath111 when clusters lie with the axis parallel to the interface .",
    "definition of the orientational order parameter used in the case of the 5a triangular bipyramid and 7a pentagonal bipyramid .",
    "@xmath109 is the angle between the normal @xmath112 to the plane of the interface ( marked in blue ) and the vector connecting the centres of the yellow spindle atoms.,width=302 ]    the ordering of the 5a and 7a clusters relative to interface , as function of the distance @xmath42 from the interface .",
    "the angle @xmath109 is the angle between the vector that connects the spindle particles and the normal to the surface .",
    "( a ) lennard - jones , @xmath113 ; ( b ) sodium , @xmath114 ; ( c ) sodium , @xmath115.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fignematic ] we plot the order parameter as function of @xmath42 for both 5a and 7a clusters for three different @xmath116 ratios .",
    "remarkably , the two types of clusters behave in an opposite way near the interface .",
    "while the 7a clusters are aligned with the five - membered ring parallel to the interface , the 5a clusters are aligned with its three membered ring _",
    "perpendicular _ to the interface .",
    "this effect increases strongly with decreasing temperature , so at that lowest temperature [ fig . [ fignematic](c ) ] in the case of 7a the angle @xmath109 is reduced , and the order parameter goes to 1/2 , half of what would be a perfectly ordered state .",
    "thus it is likely that the 5-membered ring of the 7a clusters tends to be found in the plane of the interface .",
    "assuming that 7a is in a configuration which minimises bond stretching / compression ( i.e. zero - temperature potential energy minimum ) , this would leave one end of the spindle sticking out from the free surface .",
    "this would be an energetically unfavourable situation , which could explain the suppression of 7a clusters near the interface .",
    "however the consequences of finite temperature may well play an important role here , a point to which we return in the next section .",
    "the situation is very different for 5a clusters , whose degree of ordering is also rather less pronounced .",
    "more crucially , though the ordering is such that the spindle remains in the fluid , while the three - membered ring is oriented parallel to the interface .",
    "this permits the cluster to remain inside the fluid relatively undistorted , and the effect on its concentration remains small .",
    "[ fignematic](c ) also shows that the surface layering is well reflected by the orientational ordering of the clusters .",
    "we have shown that our topological cluster classification provides insight into the local liquid structure close to a free interface , and can directly probe for local structures with fivefold symmetry .",
    "the analysis we have performed provides no evidence in support of an enhanced five - fold symmetry near the interface , however those five - fold symmetric structures that are present tend to be aligned with five - membered rings parallel to the interface .    at higher temperatures",
    ", the predominant effect appears to be related to the lowering in density induced by the interface .",
    "this is reflected by a drop in the populations of all the clusters we consider .",
    "upon reducing temperature , the interfacial density profile exhibits layering , and seems to induce a change in cluster population extending well into the dense liquid , long after the mean density is that of the bulk liquid .",
    "thus we argue that our analysis indicates that five - fold symmetry is _ suppressed _ at the liquid - vapour interface in the systems we have considered .",
    "we use our analysis to reveal orientational information on two basic clusters .",
    "close to the interface , the five - fold symmetric 7a pentagonal bipyramid is oriented with its five - membered ring lying parallel to the interface , conversely the 5a triangular bipyramid is oriented with its 3-membered ring perpendicular to the interface .",
    "both these effects are strongly enhanced at lower temperature .",
    "our analysis is topological in nature .",
    "that is to say , the structures identified are based on bonds , and we do not consider structural distortions . in particular , we note that the 7a pentagonal bipyramid , aligned with a surface , might leave a spindle atom exposed .",
    "however , for a small amount of strain , this exposed spindle could in fact lie very close to the plane of the five - membered ring .",
    "we suspect that it may do so at finite temperature .",
    "we identify two possible extensions of this work",
    ". it would be interesting to consider the effect of a wall or similar external field , as an alternative to the free interface .",
    "it would also be interesting to investigate the behaviour of clusters other than those which are minimum energy ground states in isolation , for example 5-membered rings .",
    "we have seen that the population of 7a pentagonal bipyramids is reduced near the interface , the topological basis of our analysis precludes ruling out that an exposed spindle atom might be related to this suppression , although at finite temperature we expect this effect to be small .",
    "an extension of our analysis to consider distortions in the clusters identified would be helpful .",
    "both these possibilities will be investigated in the future .",
