    "recent years have been marked by an accented interest of scientists in molecules and materials made exclusively of carbon atoms ( c ) .",
    "this interest has been initiated by discoveries of fullerenes @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite , and is fueled by many different nanoscopic shapes and structures made of carbon atoms that are continually appearing either as a result of experimental studies @xcite or imaginative theoretical constructions @xcite .",
    "structures of interest to this work are those in which carbon atoms are sp@xmath0 hybridized , as in the graphene layers in graphite .",
    "fullerenes and carbon nanotubes fit in this category , but there are many other different shapes and objects that can be constructed .",
    "the multitude of possible shapes is a result of pronounced anisotropy of carbon - carbon interactions and the relatively low energy needed to transform a hexagonal carbon ring into a pentagonal one .",
    "inclusion of heptagonal rings allows for creation of additional , negative - gaussian - curvature shapes @xcite that are not a subject of this article .",
    "carbon shapes are of interest since the same elementary constituents ( sp@xmath0 hybridized carbon atoms ) can be  assembled  in a variety of stable shapes that will not spontaneously decay or transform in some other shapes once created .",
    "the resulting shapes and structures may differ in their functionality , whatever their purpose may be .",
    "the assembly of simple elementary pieces into a possibly  engineered  or  designed ",
    "shape is a dream of nanotechnologists , and the carbon structures are thus the ideal benchmark system .",
    "nanoscale shapes of biological interest are often self - assembled - a prime example is the selfassembly of viral coatings from individual proteins that make it @xcite .",
    "even more intriguingly , the symmetries and shapes of icosahedral viruses are directly related to symmetries of  gigantic ",
    "fullerenes @xcite .",
    "both types of structures are characterized by pentagonal  disclinations  @xcite ( pentagonal carbon rings in fullerenes @xcite vs. pentameric protein aggregates in viruses @xcite ) in crystalline sheet , and both can be constructed from the triangulation of an icosahedron .",
    "this may be a coincidence , but may also point to more general and fundamental principles that may still be discovered in the study of carbon structures and shapes .",
    "viruses , as carbon shapes , also show the property of multiformity .",
    "the same viral coating proteins may assemble in icosahedral shells of varying symmetry , but may also make spherocylindrical , conical particles or even protein sheets , depending on the conditions @xcite .",
    "similar features are found in sp@xmath0 carbon shapes .",
    "although various shapes can be , more or less easily imagined , this does not mean that they should have large binding energies , or that they should be bound at all .",
    "therefore , it seems pragmatic to have a rule of thumb estimate for their energy , based solely on their imagined shape .",
    "theory of elasticity provides an excellent framework for such estimates and has been in the past successfully applied for this purpose @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to show how the energies of the various shapes that can be imagined may be estimated from simple relationships that are quite accurate when applied properly . in certain aspects ,",
    "this article is a continuation of efforts started in refs . @xcite and @xcite , but differs from them in that it studies a certain class of convex carbon shapes that include both capped carbon nanotubes and fullerenes as special limiting cases .",

    "the procedure is based on the implementation of conjugate gradient technique @xcite in combination with the latest brenner s potential for the description of carbon - carbon bonding @xcite , which provides an excellent opportunity to further examine the predictions of this relatively recently proposed potential , although the main message of this article is totally independent on the form of the potential used .",
    "section [ sec : sec3 ] contains numerical results of this article , together with elements of elasticity theory that are applied in the analysis of these results .",
    "it will be demonstrated how a simple characterization of the graphene elasticity together with the knowledge of the energy for creation of pentagonal disclination enables a reliable estimate of energies of various convex shapes .",

    "the shapes of interest to this work can be constructed as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the procedure is to cut out the outlined shape from the graphene plane and fold it into a polyhedron .",

    "the calculations were carried out for two versions of the carbon - carbon potential which obviously predict different slopes of the dependence of the excess energy on squared curvature , but note that both curves are _ linear _ up to very large curvatures i.e. small radii of carbon nanotubes .",
    "calculations with the early tersoff potential @xcite predict that somewhat larger energies are required to bend a piece of graphene plane in a cylinder with respect to those obtained by using the latest brenner potential @xcite . for the energy per unit atom in the graphene plane",

    "equation ( [ eq : atomic1 ] ) is most easily derived by considering armchair or zig - zag carbon nanotubes , since in these cases one of the bonds is either parallel ( zig - zag ) or perpendicular ( armchair ) to the cylinder axis , but for @xmath48 , the relation holds also for helical nanotubes , i.e. for small curvatures the bending energies do not depend on the symmetry of the carbon nanotube .",

    "equation ( [ eq : atomic1 ] ) shows that the excess energy per unit area is proportional to the squared curvature , in accordance with the results produced by calculations displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( note , however , that only a curvature along one direction is accounted for by eq . ( [ eq : atomic1 ] ) which is sufficient for cylindrical surface ) .",
    "it furthermore predicts that the slope of this dependence is given by the properties of the interatomic potential ( intriguingly , the factor of proportionality does not depend on the form of the repulsive part of potential for the class of bond order potentials given in refs .",
    "the slope @xmath44 can be easiliy read out from eq .",

    "in fact , if one restricts the linear fit in fig . [",
    "fig : fig2 ] to smaller curvatures ( from ( 12,12 ) to ( 16,16 ) nanotubes , @xmath60 ) one finds that the slopes are 0.839 ev and 1.036 ev , which is in significantly better agreement with the prediction of eq .",

    "the key conclusion of this subsection is that the excess energy per carbon atom ( @xmath62 ) of an infinitely long carbon cylinder can be reliably estimated from @xmath63 where @xmath44 is the elastic constant of the graphene plane related to the energetics of its bending ( the bending rigidity ) , which , for infinitensimal curvatures , can be calculated from the knowledge of the interatomic interactions in graphene as in eq .",

    "icosahedral fullerenes are ( @xmath64 ) subset of shapes considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec1 ] .",
    "they are more complex than the infinite carbon nanotubes from the standpoint of elasticity theory since they contain twelve pentagonal disclinations situated at vertices of an icosahedron .",
    "the excess energy of icosahedral fullerene relative to a piece of infinite graphene sheet with the same number of atoms is thus a result of both bending ( and possibly stretching ) of the sheet _ and _ the energy required to create disclinations . in order to calculate the bending contribution to the energy",
    ", one should have some information on the geometry of the minimal energy shape of the icosahedral fullerene .",
    "the pentagonal disclination can be constructed in a graphene plane , starting from the center of a hexagon , and cutting the plane in two directions that make an angle of 60 degrees - these cuts can be easily seen in the geometrical constructions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the smaller , cut - out piece of graphene is discarded and the remaining ( larger ) piece of graphene is then folded to rejoin the edges of the cut .",
    "the shape of minimal energy that the remaining piece of graphene adopts is a cone , since it costs less energy to bend the c - c bonds than to stretch them ( it is convenient to imagine a circular piece of graphene plane with a hexagon in its center ) . the shape will in fact be a truncated cone ( or a _ conical frustum _ ) , since the pentagonal ring at the top of the cone will be flat and parallel to the larger base of the cone .",
    "the precise description of the shape depends on the values of two - dimensional young s modulus and bending rigidity . for materials like graphene ( whose stretching requires much more energy than bending )",
    ", the conical frustum is an excellent approximation of the minimal - energy shape . from purely geometrical considerations , the half angle of the cone",
    "is easily shown to be @xmath65 .",
    "shapes of crystalline , hexagonally coordinated membranes with pentagonal disclinations have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and many of the features discussed there apply also to the case of graphene . the icosahedral fullerene is a bit more complicated from a single cone since it contains _ twelve _ pentagonal carbon rings .",
    "it seems plausible that the fullerene shape should be well described by _",
    "union _ of twelve truncated cones .",
    "the radius of the larger base of a particular cone is restricted by the presence of other cones . to illustrate these geometrical considerations , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] the shape of @xmath66 icosahedral fullerene is displayed ( left column of images ) , which is in a minimum of total energy , obtained numerically as discussed in sec .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] display a union of twelve cones with half angles of @xmath65 whose larger bases just touch .",
    "note that this geometrical construction is an excellent approximation to the _ calculated _ minimal energy shape .",
    "its small drawback is that its total area ( without inclusion of the areas of the larger bases of the cones ) is smaller from the total area of the fullerene shape which is manifested is fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] by the appearance of  holes  . note also that the regions where these holes appear are almost flat in the numerically calculated minimal energy shape of the fullerene , and their contribution to the bending energy should thus be small .",
    "having such a good representation of the shape , it is possible to directly proceed to the calculation of its bending energy . in the continuum elastic theory of membranes @xcite ,",
    "the bending energy ( @xmath67 ) is represented as @xmath68 where @xmath44 is the bending rigidity discussed in the previous subsection , @xmath69 is the gaussian rigidity , @xmath70 is the infinitensimal element of the shape surface , and @xmath57 and @xmath71 are the mean and gaussian curvature of the surface , respectively ( if @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the principal radii of curvature , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ) .",
    "note that for a cylindrical surface , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) in every point of the surface , and the total bending energy integrates to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the total area of the cylinder ( without the bases ) .",
    "this is in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : elastica1 ] ) . for conical surfaces ,",
    "the gaussian curvatures are also zero everywhere , so the total bending energy of the approximated fullerene shape will depend only on @xmath44 . integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : elastica2 ] ) over the surface of a cone whose half - angle is @xmath82 , one finds that the bending energy of a cone ( @xmath83 ) is @xmath84 which for the cones with @xmath85 yields @xcite @xmath86 where the meaning of @xmath87 and @xmath88 is illustrated in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] - these are the distances of the upper and lower bases of the conical frustum from the cone apex measured along the cone face . the value of @xmath87 can be easily evaluated due to the fact that the smaller base of the frustum is a pentagon of carbon atoms .",

    "( [ eq : elastica2 ] ) ) . although one could easily invent a nice geometrical model to estimate this contribution , it is possible to proceed further by noting that eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaefull ] ) can also be written as @xmath100 , \\label{eq : delfulc60}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the total excess energy of c@xmath102 for which the calculation with the brenner potential predicts @xmath103 ev .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] displays the results of numerical minimization of total energy of icosahedral fullerenes together with the prediction of eq . ( [ eq : delfulc60 ] ) with @xmath104 ev taken from the analysis of infinite carbon cylinders .",
    "it seems more sensible to choose this value of @xmath44 rather than the one predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : atomic1 ] ) which is appropriate for small curvatures , since close to the smaller bases of the truncated cones , condition @xmath48 , where @xmath105 is the radius of curvature is not fulfilled .",

    "note , however , that the ( infinitensimal ) analytical value of @xmath44 ( 0.83 ev ) and the one obtained from the study of infinite carbon cylinders ( 0.863 ev ) are quite similar , and one could also chose to work with the analytical value of @xmath44 with comparable success ( see below ) .    it can be seen in fig . [",
    "fig : fig4 ] that the agreement between the calculated values and those predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : delfulc60 ] ) is excellent ( note that there are _ no fit parameters _ ) .",
    "very small deviations can be mostly attributed to the fact that the regions around the larger bases of the cone are constrained by the continuity of the fullerene surface , and deviation from the cone shape is thus expected .",
    "it is to a certain extent surprising that the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delfulc60 ] ) are so precise , especially concerning the fact that the excess energy of c@xmath102 figures in it as a parameter .",
    "buckminsterfullerene is certainly not expected to be reliably described by the elasticity theory , since there are no atoms on the cone faces , only c - c bonds . yet",
    ", the elasticity theory results maintain their meaning down to fullerenes of very small sizes and small number of atoms . by examining the energies of individual atoms in the icosahedral fullerenes it is possible to proceed a bit further and to estimate the value of the core energy , @xmath97 .",
    "for example , in @xmath66 fullerene shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , the energies of atoms in pentagonal rings are -6.959 ev , while atoms situated in hexagonal carbon rings have energies of about -7.38 ev , depending on their position ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : modelpotential ] ) ) .",

    "equation ( [ eq : delfulc60 ] ) does not depend ( formally ) on this quantity , but it can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaefull ] ) which yields @xmath110 ev ( @xmath98 was set to zero ) , in a quite nice agreement with the number obtained from the detailed atomic description of the icosahedral fullerenes , especially in a view of all the details involved in the approximation of the fullerene shape .",
    "this also confirms that @xmath98 is indeed negligible part of the total energy .",
    "using the same reasoning outlined in the previous subsection , it is easy to construct an approximate shape of the elongated icosahedral fullerene ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "these can be approximated by the union of twelve conical frusta _ and _ a cylinder whose length is @xmath112 , and radius @xmath113 ( a finite - length piece of armchair ( 5@xmath13 , 5@xmath13 ) carbon nanotube ) .",

    "the first term in the expression for energy in eq . ( [ eq : cappeden ] ) is the sum of the local and bending energies associated with the twelve equal pentagonal disclinations ( conical frusta ) , and the second one corresponds to the bending energy of the finite length cylinder .",

    "equation [ eq : cappeden ] can be approximated by @xmath115 ,   \\label{eq : fullelong}\\ ] ] which simply states that the excess energy of the shape is equal to the sum of the excess energy of the icosahedral fullerene and the bending energy of the cylinder inserted in between its two  halves ",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "this equation is , however , an approximation , since it is based on the assumption that the excess energies associated with the holes in the geometrical constructions are the same for the icosahedral fullerene and the elongated icosahedral fullerene , which is not exactly the case ( compare figs . [",
    "fig : fig5 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "it furthermore contains an assumption that the elastic energies of holes do not depend on @xmath13 and @xmath9 integers characterizing the structure .",
    "nevertheless , an excellent account of the numerical data is obtained which can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "note again that the analytical results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] represent the predictions of the elasticity theory _ without _ fit parameters .",
    "the contracted icosahedral fullerenes are more complicated from the shapes considered thus far .",
    "construction of their geometrical approximation is not simple mostly due to specific geometrical constraints that the ten pentagonal disclinations situated around the equator of the shape are subjected to . when @xmath9 vanishes , the area around each of the disclinations is well represented by a cone with an angle of @xmath116 which was clearly demonstrated in subsection [ icos ] .",
    "when @xmath9 decreases ( i.e. increases in absolute value ) , the two large pentagons parallel to the shape equator whose vertices coincide with five pentagonal disclinations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) approach each other .",
    "this constrains the shape of the area around these pentagonal disclinations . as the cone was such an useful approximation of the area around pentagonal disclinations for shapes studied in subsections [ icos ] and [ elongated ]",
    ", it seems reasonable to try to describe the contracted icosahedral fullerenes also as union of cones , ten ( those arranged around the equator of the shape ) of which belong to one category , and two ( the ones at the two poles of the shape ) to another .",
    "the two cones at the poles are easily constructed as in subsections [ icos ] and [ elongated ] - these have the angles of @xmath116 .",
    "the area around ten remaining disclinations is dominated by two opposing geometrical constraints . as @xmath9 decreases , the angle subtended by a line that connects a particular disclination ( point a in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) and the one at the closest pole ( point b ) and a line that connects the disclination with the midpoint of a line drawn between the two nearest disclinations in the neigbouring pentagonal ring of disclinations ( point c ) also decreases - this angle is denoted with @xmath117 in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] . on the other hand , the angles that are subtended by the lines @xmath118 and @xmath119 or @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) _ increase _ when @xmath9 decreases .",
    "it is thus clear that the area around the disclination can not be represented by a _",
    "single _ cone .",
    "nevertheless , it seems reasonable to approximate this area by a union of pieces of surfaces of two cones , each of them satisfying one of the two opposing geometrical constraints .",
    "the angle of one of the cones is about @xmath117 , which is given by @xmath122 +   \\cos^{-1 } \\left [ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}m \\tan(\\pi/10)}{3 m - 2n } \\right].\\ ] ] the angle of the second cone ( @xmath123 ) that is searched for is larger than @xmath117 , and the contribution of this half - cone to the total elastic energy of the area surrounding the disclination is thus smaller ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : conegeneral ] ) ) . nevertheless , the second cone is important since it contains a part of the total area surrounding the disclination , thus reducing the area available to the cone with angle @xmath117 .",
    "when @xmath12 , both @xmath117 and @xmath123 angles should be @xmath124 .",
    "note that when @xmath9 decreases , angle @xmath123 changes in a significantly smaller range than @xmath117 , since it is importantly constrained by the fixed angle between lines @xmath118 and @xmath125 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "thus , i shall neglect the change of @xmath123 with @xmath9 and set it to a constant @xmath126 -    \\cos^{-1 } \\left [ \\tan(\\pi/10 ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & 2.04 \\sin^{-1}(5/6 ) ,   \\label{eq : alfa2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is obviously quite close to @xmath127 , as it should be , and which was chosen so that @xmath128 , since i am further going to assume that each of the two cones takes exactly a half of the total area available to the disclination . together with the choice for @xmath123 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alfa2 ] ) , this assumption shall yield the elastic disclination energy in the limit when @xmath12 equal to that characteristic of icosahedral fullerenes studied in subsection [ icos ] .",
    "note that the _ axes _ of the two cones do not need to be identical - the two pieces of the conical surfaces can be rotated with respect to each other at will .",
    "it is also irrelevant how the particular cone ( half)surface is constructed as long as the pieces of it are bounded by the arcs of the two bases subtending the same angle from the cone axis and the two lines ( along the cone face ) that connect the arc ends in the upper and lower base .",
    "thus , there is a significant freedom in constructing a shape around the disclination , but for all of the thus constructed shapes the buckling energies are equal .",
    "note also that for @xmath111 points d , b , h , and e do not lie in a plane .",
    "the proposed construction is admittedly rather approximate .",
    "for example , one could object that the fractions of the total area belonging to each of the two cones should also ( at least slightly ) change with @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless , the construction accounts for _ most important _ geometrical constraints imposed on the area around pentagonal disclinations situated around the equator of the shape due to the presence of neighboring disclinations .",
    "the exact answers to all of the objections regarding the proposed construction that could be easily put forth would require a solution of the nonlinear problem in the theory of elasticity , which is not the aim of this study - the aim is to obtain a simple insight in the energetics of the shapes using the simplest possible application of the elasticity theory , and to obtain , preferably analytic , expressions for the excess energies of such shapes .    following the reasoning presented in the previous paragraph and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : conegeneral ] ) for the calculation of bending energy of a cone with arbitrary half - angle , the total excess energy of the proposed geometrical approximation to the contracted icosahedral shapes is @xmath129 where @xmath130 @xmath131}{\\sin [ \\alpha_1 ( n)/2 ] } + \\frac{\\cos ^2 ( \\alpha_2 /2)}{\\sin ( \\alpha_2/2 ) } \\right \\},\\ ] ] and @xmath132 the last parameter ( @xmath133 ) is simply a half of the distance ( in units of @xmath8 ) between the two nearest neighboring disclinations situated at different pentagonal rings of disclinations around the equator of the shape ( points a and e in fig . [",
    "fig : fig7 ] ) .    numerically calculated excess energies of the shapes and the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : squeezenerg ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] and denoted by symbols and lines , respectively . in evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq : squeezenerg ] ) , @xmath98 was set to zero , @xmath134 ev was taken from the analysis of icosahedral fullerenes in subsection [ icos ] , and @xmath135 ev , as in the two previous subsections .",
    "note again that there are no fitting parameters involved .",
    "the agreement of the predictions of the elasticity theory with the numerical results is striking . in spite of all the approximations involved in the geometrical construction of the equilibrium shape , eq .",
    "( [ eq : squeezenerg ] ) both qualitatively and quantitatively accounts for the numerical data .",
    "the largest disagreement is found for the smallest shapes ( @xmath136 ) , but the curves correctly account for the appearance of minimum in excess energies for some finite @xmath9 ( panel ( a ) of fig . [",
    "fig : fig8 ] ) , and for the increase in excess energies when @xmath137 becomes comparable to @xmath13 .",
    "it is worth noting that although the number of atoms in @xmath138 structures is smaller than in @xmath139 structures ( regular icosahedral fullerenes ) by 20 @xmath140 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : totnum ] ) ) , the total excess energies are still significantly larger in such structures , which is a consequence of an energetically unfavorable geometrical positions occupied by the ten disclinations around the equator of the shape .",
    "this consideration can also explain the minimum in excess energies obtained for some @xmath9 when @xmath13 is fixed - as the elongation number @xmath9 decreases , the number of atoms in the structure decrease , but the contribution to excess energy due to ten disclinations around the equator increase .",
    "the combined consequences of these two effects lead to the appearance of a minimum in excess energy as a function of @xmath9 . of the three types of shapes",
    "studied , the contracted icosahedral fullerenes typically have the largest excess energies per atom .",
    "for example , the excess energy of ( @xmath141 , @xmath142 ) contracted fullerene ( @xmath143 ev ) that contains 4000 atoms is significantly _ larger _ from the excess energy of ( @xmath144 , @xmath12 ) regular icosahedral fullerene ( @xmath145 ev ) that contains _ larger _ number of atoms ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "it has been shown that the insight in the geometry of the equilibrium shapes can be extremely useful in estimating their ( excess ) energies .",
    "such an approach does not require detailed description of the interatomic interactions characteristic of a shape or molecule in question , instead it relies exclusively on the knowledge of elastic parameters of the material that the shape ( shell ) is made of . in the studies presented in this article ,",
    "the parameters that were necessary for reliable estimation of energy were the local energy of pentagonal ring of carbon atoms ( @xmath97 ) , and the bending rigidity of graphene plane ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "both of these parameters derive from the quantum - mechanical nature of bonding of atoms ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : atomic1 ] ) ) that make the shape .",
    "surprisingly enough , it has been demonstrated that the application of the simplest theory of elasticity yields reliable results even for shapes made of a small number of atoms , i.e. in the regime where its applicability is not to be expected .",
    "for all of the shapes considered , the knowledge of the two - dimensional young s modulus of graphene @xcite was not needed , which suggests that in such shapes almost all of the elastic energy is of the _ bending _ type , while the energies associated with stretching are negligible . for shapes in which the geometrical constraints on the shape are strong ( as in the case of contracted icosahedral fullerenes ) ,",
    "the application of elasticity theory may be involved and complicated .",
    "nevertheless , the identification of the constraints and their effects on the allowed shapes yields an additional insight in the energetics of the shapes and its behaviour within a certain class of shapes studied .",
