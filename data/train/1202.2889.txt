    "it was found that with dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath79 the limits on neutrino mass are relaxed considerably .",
    "this remains true also when the galaxy cluster mass function cosmological data taken in account .",
    "the upper limits on total neutrino mass and effective number of neutrino species in the model with free @xmath80 , and free number of massive neutrinos are @xmath81  ev and @xmath82 in assumption that three neutrino species have equal non - zero mass , and @xmath83  ev and @xmath84 in case if there is only one type of massive neutrino in the model .",
    "therefore , the limits on total neutrino mass , obtained with galaxy cluster mass function data taken in account , are still in poor agreement with suggested sterile neutrino mass near @xmath2ev , even in cosmological models with dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , all available cosmological data are consistent with one additional light sterile neutrino",

    "we emphasize that the constraints obtained in our work apply only to light sterile neutrinos thermalized in early universe .",
    "in order to obtain most powerful constraints on dark energy equation of state , the measurements of accelerated expansion of universe from the observations of distant supernovae type ia were used in @xcite . on the other hand , during the last years it become clear that the errors of cosmological measurements based on sn ia data are dominated by systematic uncertainties @xcite . in recent works on sn ia observations ,",
    "systematical errors are estimated to be very significant and to be larger than statistical errors in these data .",
    "these uncertainties are mostly consist of uncertainties of photometrical calibrations , color corrections on the extinction in host galaxies , selection effects in sn ia surveys and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with these considerations in mind , it is interesting to study the possibilities to obtain powerful dark energy constraints independently on sn ia measurements .",

    "therefore , the constraints from galaxy cluster mass function data and from sn ia observations are comparably powerful .",

    "[ fig : olwsncl2 ] .",
    "one can see that galaxy cluster mass function data significantly improve the dark energy equation of state parameter constraints .",
    "the reason is that these data are independent and have different degeneracies in parameter space . from these data we obtain the following measurement : @xmath89  ( stat . )  @xmath90  ( sys . ) , where sn ia systematic uncertainties are also included in resulting systematic error .",
    "these constraints appears to be somewhat better than those obtained in @xcite .      the constraint on the curvature of universe and dark energy equation of state parameter in _ wcdm _ model with @xmath34 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : okwsncl ] and [ fig : okwsncl2 ] . in model with non - zero space curvature",

    "one can see , that galaxy cluster mass function data significantly improve the overall constraints for @xmath92 and @xmath93 parameters .",

    "all considered cosmological data combined together are consistent with the model of flat universe with cosmological constant ( _ @xmath19cdm _ ) . in frames of this model",

    "the data on galaxy cluster mass function allow to constrain these parameters with as high as @xmath94 accuracy ( see table  [ tab : pars ] ) .",
    "at the same time , the systematical errors from the uncertainties of cluster mass measurements appear to be comparable to statistical ones .",

    "model , the strongest constraints are obtained : @xmath74ev and @xmath54 . however , if both total neutrino mass and effective number of neutrino species are considered as free parameters in _ @xmath19cdm _ model , i.e. , the model with arbitrary number of massive neutrinos is considered , the constraints turn out to be significantly less strong : @xmath77ev and @xmath63 . moreover , all considered cosmological data are somewhat better fitted by the model with non - zero neutrino mass @xmath0ev and larger than standard value of the number of neutrino species , @xmath95 .",
    "these constraints can have an important application to study of the possibility of the existence of light sterile neutrinos with masses near @xmath2ev , which were suggested to explain the results of short baseline neutrino oscillations searches experiments _ lsdn _ and _ miniboone _ , and also recently discovered , so - called reactor neutrino anomaly .",
    "however , as compared to cosmological constraints obtained in our work , in order to explain the results of these experiments , too large number of additional neutrino species ( more than one ) or too large neutrino masses @xmath96ev are required .    in our work the updated constraints on dark energy equation of state parameters",

    "we show , that taking in account systematical uncertainties , dark energy parameters constraints from cluster mass function data are comparable in their power with those from sn ia observations .",
    "moreover , in contrast to sn ia data , the errors of dark energy parameters measurements from current cluster mass function data are mainly statistical , and are not dominated by systematic uncertainties .",
