    "the study was made for a third body of negligible mass .",
    "then , they generalized some of these results for the case when the third body disturbs the other two bodies of the system .",
    "one of the main results found was a relation between the coorbital trajectory and its associated zero velocity curve .",
    "there are several studies on the origin of the trojan asteroids , but not too many on the origin of the coorbital satellites .",
    "the origin of these satellites and trojans asteroids are believed to be associated to one of the following mechanisms ( yoder et al.,1983 ; smith et al.,1981 ) : ( i ) capture by gas drag , ( ii ) congenital formation or ( iii ) rupture of a parent body .",
    "chanut et al .",

    "they considered several values for the relative mass of the secondary body , from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "they explored the orbital evolution of planetesimals under orbital decay toward the secondary body orbit .",
    "there are three possible outcomes along such evolution : collision with the secondary body , capture in the coorbital region or crossing the coorbital region toward the central body .",
    "once a planetesimal is captured in a coorbital trajectory , its amplitude of oscillation around one of the triangular lagrangian points shrinks until it is fixed over the lagrangian point .",
    "they also showed that the location of the lagrangian points change according to the density of the gas .    with the numerous discoveries of the extrasolar planets",
    "beaug et al .",
    "( 2007 ) analyzed the formation of hypothetical earth - type coorbital planets in extrasolar systems .",
    "the central body was taken as equal to one solar mass and the giant planet with jupiter s mass .",
    "they considered two scenarios of formation , one gas - free scenario and another rich - gas scenario . in both of them",
    "there were the formation of a single coorbital of the terrestrial type , but due to gravitational instability with other bodies , the accretion process was not efficient .",
    "in this paper we study the mechanism of congenital formation of coorbital satellites and in some points this mechanism is similiar to adopted in beaug et al .",
    "according to the modern theories of planetary formation , in the beginning of the solar system formation there was a cloud of gas and dust that settled in a disk .",
    "due to several factors the gas dissipated along the time . in the first stages the particles were of the size of sub - micrometers up to the order of centimeters .",
    "this disk of gas and dust gradually generated larger bodies through physical collisions leading to agglomeration .",
    "successive encounters among them resulted in a large number of meter sized aggregates .",
    "from these objects originated planetesimals of the order of kilometers .",
    "further encounters between planetesimals led to the formation of the planet s progenitors of terrestrial size or even ten times this size ( armitage , 2007 ) .",
    "the formation of planetary satellite systems are thought to have followed a very similar way ( safronov , 1969 ; wetherill 1980 , 1990 ; hayashi et al .",
    "1985 ; greenberg , 1989 ) .    in the present work we consider an intermediate stage of saturn s satellite system formation .",
    "in this stage all the major satellites are almost formed ( here called proto - satellites ) , there is almost no gas left , but there is still plenty of small planetesimals in the disk .",
    "our model of study is characterized by a central body ( saturn ) , a secondary body ( proto - satellite ) and a cloud of plantesimals . since it is assumed that the proto - satellite has already a significative mass , which is several orders of magnitude larger than the planetesimals , it defines ( together with the planet ) the structure of the phase space with the five lagrangian points .",
    "then , we consider a cloud of planetesimals in the coorbital region around one of the triangular lagrangian points , under the gravitational influence of saturn and the proto - satellite .",
    "the collision between planetesimals are considered constructive and through this accretion process larger bodies are built in the coorbital region .",
    "this paper has the following structure . in the next section we present the methodology and assumptions adopted in our numerical simulations .",
    "the results of the simulations are presented in section 3 . finally , in the last section we present some final comments and our conclusions .",
    "the dynamical system considered is composed by saturn ( the central body ) , a proto - satellite and a cloud of planetesimals . the mass of the proto - satellite was chosen to be @xmath0 of saturn s mass , which is close to the masses of dione and thetys ( table 2 ) .",
    "it is placed in a circular orbit with the semi - major axis equal to that of thetys .",
    "the mass of the proto - satelite might vary along the simulation due to some collisions with planetesimals , but its small growth do not affect significantly the dynamic of the planetesimals around the lagrangian points ( fleming and hamilton , 2000 ) .",
    "the planetesimal clouds were always initially randomly distributed in a sector around @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the sector is delimited by an arc of @xmath16 , centered on the lagrangian point , and the extreme orbital radii of the largest horseshoe orbit ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the half width of the largest horseshoe orbit is given by dermott & murray ( 1981a ) as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the relative mass and the semi - major axis of the proto - satellite , respectively .",
    "studying the overlap of first order mean motion resonances , wisdom ( 1980 ) found an expression that gives the width of a chaotic region from the planar circular orbit of a secondary body .",
    "therefore , it is important to have in mind that just outside the coorbital region ( interior and exterior ) there is a chaotic region . particles in this region usually tend to have close encounters with the proto - satellite and get large eccentricities , leaving the neighborhood .     and @xmath9 were the planetesimals are initially distributed .",
    "each sector is delimited by an arc of @xmath16 , centered on the lagrangian point , and the extreme orbital radii of the largest horseshoe orbit .",
    "the half width of the largest horseshoe orbit , @xmath20 , is given by equation ( 1 ) . ]    since we are interested in the formation of the small counterparts of coorbital satellite systems , in general , we considered clouds of planetesimals with the total mass of the order of the smaller coorbital satellites , given in table 1 .",
    "we also considered that all planetesimals have the same initial mass , @xmath21 .",
    "we performed simulations for different clouds of planetesimals .",
    "we adopted clouds of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 planetesimals each one for three different values of @xmath21 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 masses of saturn .",
    "the simulations were made through numerical integrations using the burlish - stoer integrator from the package mercury ( chambers , 1999 ) .",
    "the length of the integration , @xmath22 ( in orbital periods of the proto - satellite ) , varied according to the value of @xmath21 . for @xmath23 it was used @xmath24 , for @xmath25 it was used @xmath26 and for @xmath27 it was used @xmath28 .",
    "that is necessary due to the gravitational attraction between the planetesimals , which is smaller as smaller are their masses , leading to a longer time for the system to evolve .    for each cloud of planetesimals with a specific value of @xmath21 we performed at least two independent simulations .",
    "one placing it around @xmath8 and the other around @xmath9 .",
    "we also tested the effect of saturn s oblateness by running extra simulations with the inclusion of the @xmath29 term in the gravitational potential of the central body .",
    "the planetesimals in all simulations were initially placed in circular orbits .",
    "along the numerical simulations the planetesimals collide among them generating lager planetesimals .",
    "the collisions are always considered constructive .",
    "i.e. inelastic collisions . by the end of the integration time",
    "there are only a few ( at most four ) large planetesimals left .",
    "the final masses of the remaining planetesimals are represented by @xmath30 .    in order to have an idea of the time evolution of these systems we present a sample of snapshots for two representative simulations .",
    "figure 2 shows the dynamical evolution of a cloud of @xmath6 planetesimals with @xmath25 , initially distributed around @xmath8 . in each frame",
    "are shown the values of the osculating semi - major axis and eccentricities of the remaining planetesimals at a given moment .",
    "the orbital radius of the proto - satellite is considered as unity .",
    "the color grade indicates the mass of the planetesimal .",
    "since we are interested in the formation of small coorbital satellites , the best candidates should be the remaining planetesimals with low eccentricity and semi - major axis inside the coorbital region .",
    "so we included in the plots the dashed curves that indicate the coorbital region defined by the largest horseshoe width ( @xmath31 ) . in general , the planetesimals that leave the coorbital region present chaotic behavior and collide with the proto - satellite .    from the plots of figure 2 we notice that the eccentricities of the planetesimals increase as they start to grow",
    "however , they are limited to low values ( @xmath32 ) . after about 1068 years",
    "there are only three planetesimals left and it takes about a thousand years to reach a single planetesimal . that last one has a mass of @xmath33    in figure 3 we present the dynamical evolution of a cloud of @xmath4 planetesimals with @xmath27 , initially distributed around @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution is very much similar to that presented in figure 2 .",
    "however , at least two major differences should be pointed out .",
    "the eccentricities do not get much larger then 0.001 and the time scales are much longer then in the previous case .",
    "these two features are naturally due to the lower values of the initial mass of the planetesimals , @xmath21 , and the total mass of the cloud of the planetesimals .",
    "larger masses produce stronger gravitational interactions accelerating the evolution of the system and increasing the values of eccentricities .",
    "[ figura 1 ]              the evolution of all the other numerical simulations we have performed are similar to these ones .",
    "however , the plots presented in figures 2 and 3 do not guarantee that the remaining planetesimals are in coorbital orbits with the proto - satellite .",
    "therefore , we analyzed the evolution of the angle @xmath34 between the remaining planetesimals and the proto - satellite , called libration angle .",
    "this angle is defined as the difference in mean longitudes , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the mean longitudes of the planetesimal and secondary body respectively .",
    "a representative sample of such evolution is presented in figures 4 to 7 . in each figure we present two plots .",
    "the top plot shows the evolution of @xmath34 and the bottom one shows the evolution the of planetesimal s mass .",
    "all plots cover the whole integration time and they are shown in a logarithmic scale .",
    "the temporal evolution of the libration angle confirmed that in all simulations the remaining planetesimals are in coorbital trajectories .",
    "the plots show a complete variety of evolutions .",
    "planetesimals that started in tadpole orbits around @xmath8 or @xmath9 and ended in horseshoe orbits ( figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "planetesimals that started in tadpole orbit around @xmath8 and ended in tadpole orbit around @xmath9 ( figure 4 ) or in tadpole orbit around @xmath8 ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the evolutions are not always smooth .",
    "there are cases of tadpole orbits that `` jump '' from @xmath8 to @xmath9 and then again back to @xmath8 ( figure 7 ) . and",
    "others that `` jump '' from @xmath9 to @xmath8 and then to a horseshoe orbit ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the changes in the amplitude of oscillation of the coorbital planetesimals along their evolution are associated to the collisions with other planetesimals .",
    "several of these changes can clearly be seen by comparison between the top and the bottom plots of each figure .",

    "as we can see , in several simulations there were more then one planetesimal left . in some cases we followed the simulations for longer times .",
    "for example , simulation 13a ( table 3 ) was integrated for more then @xmath42 years and no extra collision occurred along the second half of such integration time . in the case of simulation 14a ( table 3 ) , the integration was extended to one million years and there were still two planetesimals left .",

    "the distribution of librational amplitudes of the final bodies that remain in tadpole orbits varies from 4 up to 75 degrees.the real coorbitals have a libration amplitude of which varies from 1.3 up to 25.9 degrees .",
    "however , some mechanisms could reduce the amplitude of libration , for example , the gas drag ( chanut et al . , 2008 ) , mass accretion or radial migration of the secondary body ( fleming and hamilton , 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we do not consider these mechanisms , but might be included in future works .",
    "the effects of mean motion resonances of nearby satellites shows to be of no significative relevance for the present model of congenital formation of coorbitals .",
    "the results presented here might look like obvious .",
    "however , in beaug et al ( 2007 ) it was found that a growing planetary embryo generates a chaotic region around the lagrangian point , inhibiting additional accretion and setting a limit in the final mass of the coorbital body .",
    "they studied the possibility of congenital formation of earth like planets in coorbital orbits of exoplanetary systems . in their work",
    "they adopted systems like the jupiter - sun system , with relative mass of @xmath15 , and did not manage to form coorbital planets with mass larger than @xmath111 this phenomena does not occur in the present work because the results of the simulation are strongly dependent on the relative mass of the secondary body ( izidoro et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "it is important to comment that in the present congenital model the final coorbitals formed are of similar masses .",
    "however , dione has one coorbital , helene whose mass is about two orders of magnitude higher than the other coorbital , polydeuces . therefore , the model as considered in the present work is not able to explain by itself alone such configuration .",
    "consequently , there is still plenty of work to be done .",
    "the comments and questions of an anonymous referee helped to improve this paper .",
    "this work was supported by the brazilian agencies capes and cnpq , and by the foundation of the state of s~ ao paulo fapesp .",
