    "each dirac point in momentum space is composed of two superimposed weyl nodes of opposite chirality .",
    "such points are usually obtained by fine tuning of certain physical parameters ( e.g. , the spin - orbit coupling strength or chemical composition ) and are difficult to control .",

    "the dirac semimetal band structure was indeed observed @xcite in @xmath7 and @xmath8 opening the path toward experimental investigations of the properties of 3d dirac semimetals .",
    "weyl semimetals is another group of materials that is closely related to 3d dirac semimetals and have already attracted a lot of theoretical interest ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "they are characterized by topologically non - trivial weyl nodes in reciprocal space .",
    "weyl nodes are monopoles of the berry flux and , therefore , can appear or annihilate only in pairs .",

    "since the magnetic field breaks the time - reversal symmetry , a dirac ( semi-)metal in a magnetic field may transform into a weyl one with weyl nodes separated in momentum space by a nonzero chiral shift @xcite . experimentally , the transition from a dirac metal to a weyl one in a magnetic field might have been observed in @xmath10 for @xmath11 @xcite . in moderately strong magnetic fields ,",

    "the fermi arcs on the opposite surfaces of a semimetal sample together with the fermi surfaces of bulk states form a closed fermi surface . in an external magnetic field ,",
    "the nontrivial structure of the corresponding fermi surface gives rise to closed magnetic orbits involving the surface fermi arcs @xcite .",

    "@xcite that the interaction effects can change the separation between weyl nodes in momentum space and the length of the fermi arcs in the reciprocal space and , thus , affect these magnetic orbits . as a result , we found that the period of oscillations of the density of states related to closed magnetic orbits involving fermi arcs has a non - trivial dependence on the orientation of the magnetic field projection in the plane of the semimetal surface @xcite .",
    "if experimentally observed , such a dependence would provide an important clue to the effects of interactions in weyl semimetals .",
    "normally , one would not expect any surface fermi arcs in 3d dirac semimetals because the dirac point has no topological charge and the associated berry flux vanishes . in refs .",

    "recently we showed @xcite that this is indeed the case for dirac semimetals @xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the physical reason for their nontrivial topological properties is connected with a discrete symmetry of the low - energy effective hamiltonian .",
    "the symmetry classification allows one to split all electron states into two separate sectors , each describing a weyl semimetal with a pair of weyl nodes and broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry is preserved in the complete theory because its transformation interchanges states from the two different sectors .",

    "the function @xmath32 plays the role of a momentum dependent mass ( gap ) function that vanishes at the dirac points .",

    "hamiltonian ( [ model - hamiltonian - canonical ] ) , describing two subsets of the opposite chirality states near a single dirac point , does not appear to have any interesting topological properties . also , by itself , it is unlikely to give rise to any fermi arcs states .",
    "it is easy to check , however , that hamiltonian ( [ low - energy - hamiltonian4x4 ] ) linearized near @xmath46 has a similar structure and describes two additional subsets of the opposite chirality states .",
    "as we argue below , the superposition of the two sectors of the theory is nontrivial and gives rise to an interesting topological structure @xcite .",
    "let us briefly review the symmetry properties of the low - energy hamiltonian following ref .",
    "we start by pointing out that , as expected , the hamiltonian ( [ low - energy - hamiltonian ] ) is invariant under the time - reversal and inversion symmetries , i.e. , @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is complex conjugation ) and @xmath50 having both , the time - reversal and inversion symmetries , suggests that the corresponding compounds are not weyl semimetals .",

    "it is instructive to start from the approximate hamiltonian without the mass function @xmath32 ( or , alternatively , @xmath51 ) . in this case",
    ", the @xmath52 hamiltonian takes a block diagonal form : @xmath53 .",
    "the explicit form of the upper block is given by @xmath54   \\\\",

    "( the lower block @xmath55 has a similar form , except that @xmath56 is replaced by @xmath57 . ) it is well known @xcite that such a weyl semimetal has the surface fermi arc connecting the weyl nodes of opposite chirality at @xmath46 and @xmath35 . because of the sign difference , @xmath58 , the chiralities of the states near the weyl nodes at @xmath34 are opposite for the upper and lower block hamiltonians .",
    "thus , the complete @xmath52 block diagonal hamiltonian @xmath59 describes two superimposed copies of weyl semimetal with two pairs of overlapping nodes .",
    "since the opposite chirality weyl nodes coincide exactly in momentum space , they effectively give rise to a pair of dirac points at @xmath34 . at the same time , because the opposite chirality nodes come from two different weyl copies , they can not annihilate and can not form topologically trivial dirac points .",
    "in fact , the corresponding approximate model describes a @xmath0 weyl semimetal @xcite .",
    "the nontrivial topological properties , associated with the underlying @xmath0 weyl semimetal structure , ensure that the resulting dirac semimetal possesses surface fermi arcs .",
    "it is easy to show that the existence of the @xmath0 weyl semimetal structure in the absence of @xmath32 is connected with the continuous symmetry @xmath60 of the approximate hamiltonian @xmath59 .",
    "this symmetry describes independent phase transformations of the spinors that correspond to the up- and down - block hamiltonians , @xmath61 and @xmath55 , respectively .    for @xmath62 , the continuous symmetry @xmath63 is broken down to its diagonal subgroup @xmath64 that describes the usual charge conservation .",
    "however , the low - energy hamiltonian ( [ low - energy - hamiltonian ] ) with the momentum dependent mass function @xmath65 possesses a ud - parity , defined by the following transformation @xcite : @xmath66 where matrix @xmath67 has the following block diagonal form : @xmath68 and @xmath42 is the @xmath43 unit matrix .",
    "for the hamiltonian to be symmetric under the ud - parity , it is crucial that the mass function @xmath32 changes its sign when @xmath69 [ while the functions @xmath70 and @xmath33 in the diagonal elements do not change their signs ] . in the special case of a momentum independent mass function , such a discrete symmetry does not exist .    as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the existence of the noncommuting time - reversal and ud - parity symmetries implies that the @xmath71 semimetal is , in fact , a @xmath0 weyl semimetal .",
    "in such a semimetal , all quasiparticle states can be split into two separate groups , labeled by the eigenvalues @xmath72 of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the operator that changes the sign of the @xmath75 component of momentum , @xmath76 .",
    "effectively , each group of states defines a weyl semimetal with a broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the corresponding symmetry is preserved in the complete theory , in which the two copies of weyl semimetals are superimposed .",
    "the @xmath0 weyl semimetal structure of @xmath71 ( @xmath12 ) is also supported by the explicit calculation of the berry connection and the berry curvature in each weyl sector described @xcite . in particular , the corresponding results for the curvature in the momentum space reveal a clear dipole structure .",
    "it is natural , that each weyl sector , described by quasiparticle states with a fixed eigenvalue of @xmath77 , should give rise to fermi arcs connecting the pairs of weyl nodes at @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , such arcs should be topologically protected and could not be removed by small perturbations of model parameters .    in our discussion of fermi arcs",
    "below , it will be also useful to take into account that there exists yet another discrete symmetry defined by the following transformation : @xmath78 where @xmath79 it is interesting to note that the product of the @xmath80 and @xmath81 transformations @xmath82 is also a symmetry of the low - energy hamiltonian ( [ low - energy - hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the symmetry @xmath83 is related to the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath84 is also the symmetry of the low - energy hamiltonian ( [ low - energy - hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "together the operators @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath83 form a non - commutative discrete group .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ low - energy - hamiltonian ] ) is rather complicated , therefore , the corresponding analytic calculations of its surface fermi states are quite involved and not much revealing .",
    "therefore , our general strategy in analyzing these states will be to start from a simplified model and then move forward to the realistic model by adding step - by - step the necessary missing pieces .",
    "in order to get an insight into the structure of the surface fermi arcs in the low - energy model described by hamiltonian ( [ low - energy - hamiltonian ] ) , it is instructive to first study the surface fermi arcs in a simplified @xmath43 model , given by one of the diagonal blocks , e.g. , @xmath61 in eq .",

    "the semimetal itself is in the upper @xmath92 ( lower @xmath93 ) half - space when we describe the surface arc states on the bottom ( top ) surface .",
    "( of course , in the absence of any effects that break the inversion symmetry @xmath94 explicitly , the two cases will be related by a simple symmetry transformation . ) without loss of generality , we will concentrate primarily on the bottom surface states .",
    "the boundary condition on the semimetal surface will be imposed by replacing the parameter @xmath95 with the @xmath96 on the vacuum side of the boundary and taking the limit @xmath97 @xcite . from a physics viewpoint ,",
    "such a replacement is the simplest way to prevent quasiparticle from escaping into the vacuum .",
    "taking into account that the fermi arc states should be localized at the @xmath91 boundary , let us rewrite hamiltonian ( [ model - xxx ] ) in the following form : @xmath98 where , for the convenience of further derivations , we replaced @xmath99 .",
    "we will see in what follows that the presence of the terms with the second derivative with respect to @xmath101 in hamiltonian ( [ block - model - u ] ) leads to many technical complications and makes the analysis rather involved . therefore , to set up the stage , in this subsection we start our analysis in an even more simplified model , described by hamiltonian ( [ block - model - u ] ) with @xmath102 and @xmath103 set to zero .",
