    "lattice simulations of the energy of static quark - quark or quark - antiquark ( @xmath0 ) systems have been studied for various configurations of the gluonic field  @xcite .",
    "they effectively represent the spectrum of gluonic excitations in the presence of sources .",
    "the results of simulations indicate that the spectrum is quite complex with an unusual ordering of levels and unexpected behavior for large separations between the sources . in the following",
    "we will specialize to the spectrum in the presence of @xmath0 sources and in the absence of light quark pairs .",
    "the wave function of the gluon field can be characterized according to its behavior under the symmetries of the @xmath0 system .",
    "these include rotation around the @xmath0 axis , hence after chosen to be in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "the corresponding conserved quantum number , @xmath2 represents projection of the total gluon angular momentum on the @xmath0 axis and is conventionally denoted by @xmath3 corresponding to projections , @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "other symmetries are the combined product of parity and charge conjugation , @xmath5 , with eigenvalues denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively and reflection in the @xmath10 plane , @xmath11 . the representation space of qcd eigenstates in the presence of static @xmath0 sources is then given by states labeled as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distance between the sources .",
    "the corresponding energies will be denoted by @xmath14 .    from lattice simulations the following characteristics of",
    "the the spectrum emerge .",
    "as expected , the ground state has @xmath15 quantum numbers and as a function of @xmath13 is well described by the `` coulomb+linear '' , cornell - type potential .",
    "the first excited state has one unit of gluon angular momentum along the @xmath0 axis and _ negative _ @xmath5 .",
    "the state with @xmath16 and positive @xmath5 has energy higher by @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "this fact alone can be used to discriminate between various pictures describing the dynamics of gluonic modes .",
    "for example , if the gluon field is thought of as a localized quasi - particle that interacts with the quark sources  @xcite in a way that satisfies casimir scaling  @xcite , then it would be expected that the @xmath19 wave , spherically symmetric gluon wave function has lower energy than the @xmath20-wave with one unit of orbital angular momentum . since gluons have internal spin - parity quantum numbers @xmath21 this would result in @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) state having lower energy than the @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) contradicting lattice results . a similar reversed ordering",
    "is observed in higher excitations as well .",
    "the @xmath26 state has lower energy than @xmath27 which in the constituent picture means that the gluon state with two units of orbital angular momentum has energy lower than the state with one unit .",
    "the same is true for excited @xmath28 states . the @xmath29 state which in the constituent picture has one unit of orbital angular momentum has lower energy than the first excited @xmath30 with vanishing orbital angular momentum .",
    "higher in the spectrum the @xmath31 corresponding to two units of orbital angular momentum has lower energy than @xmath32 with one unit of orbital angular momentum , albeit the splittings between these higher excitations are smaller than for the @xmath33 states .",
    "these inconsistencies between lattice results and the constituent picture have been noticed in  @xcite .",
    "the bag model  @xcite seems to be doing better in this respect .",
    "the boundary conditions on the gluon field , which set it free inside the bag cavity make the te mode with pseudo - vector , @xmath34 , quantum numbers to have lower energy than the tm mode with @xmath21 .",
    "this in turn leads to the energy of @xmath24 state to be lower than for the @xmath35 state  @xcite . finally in",
    "@xcite it was observed that the non - relativistic flux tube model  @xcite also predicts the state with @xmath16 and @xmath8 quantum numbers to be the first excited state .",
    "this is because in the flux tube model the gluon degrees of freedom moving in a plane transverse to the @xmath0 axis have negative parity but , unlike the vector potential have positive internal charge conjugation .",
    "thus both the bag model and the flux tube model give the right ordering of the spectrum of low lying gluonic excitations , albeit for different reasons .",
    "the constituent gluon picture of  @xcite was based on the mean field representation of the coulomb gauge qcd , however it did not take into account the interactions emerging from the non - abelian coulomb potential . in",
    "@xcite it was shown how such interactions affect the @xmath36 potentials . here",
    "we extend that analysis to gluonic excitations with other symmetries .",
    "the main finding is that the non - abelian coulomb potential is responsible for reversing the naive ordering expected from two body quark - gluon interactions .",
    "we also find that the overall scale of gluonic excitations in the mean - field quasi - particle picture is somewhat higher but consistent with the lattice results thus making the constituent gluon model a viable representation of the low energy gluon dynamics .",
    "this representation also explains the degeneracies in the spectrum seen in the lattice data at small @xmath0 separations .",
    "such degeneracies are expected as the system becomes more spherically symmetric . at large @xmath0 separations the gluonic wave function",
    "is expected to be qualitatively different from that of a single or a few quasi - particle state  @xcite .",
    "as separation between color sources increases the mean field coulomb interaction is expected to rise more rapidly than the true energy of the system  @xcite .",
    "thus as the separation increases states with a large number of gluons separated , on average , by a small fraction of the @xmath0 distance @xmath13 are expected to have lower energy than states with a small number of gluons separated by a distance of the order of the @xmath0 separation . at what @xmath0 distances",
    "the transition from the constituent , few gluon picture to the flux tube or string like picture takes place is however still an open question .",
    "analysis of lattice results for the splitting between gluonic levels at large @xmath13 does not conclusively favor the string like picture even for @xmath0 separations as large as a few fermi  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "we have shown that if the mean field coulomb energy also rises linearly with the @xmath13 , as indicated by lattice computations  @xcite then it is difficult to generate the constituent string and the state is dominated by valence constituent gluons .",
    "this is because the coulomb energy of a state of @xmath37 gluons separated from each other by a distance @xmath38 does not depend on the number of gluons  @xcite , thus an increase in the average number of gluons can only originate from mixing .",
    "however as @xmath13 increases it turns out that mixing between states with a different number of gluons is much smaller than the diagonal coulomb energy  @xcite .",
    "lattice results of  @xcite show that the coulomb energy rises linearly with the @xmath0 separation with a string tension which is roughly three times bigger than that of the true energy , however , since the lattice @xmath0 state used to compute the coulomb energy is not the same at the mean field state which defines the quasi particle gluon basis it is possible that the coulomb energy of the latter grows with @xmath13 faster than linearly , _",
    "i.e _ as @xmath39 with @xmath40 . in this case",
    "the average number of gluons at fixed @xmath13 would roughly correspond to the minimum with respect to @xmath37 of @xmath41 leading to @xmath42 and energy rising linearly with @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath43 represents the average kinetic energy of a quasi - gluon .",
    "it is thus possible that there is a smooth connection between the quasi - particle and flux tube representation , but we leave a more quantitative description for the future . in the following we explore the fine structure of the coulomb interaction and its role in ordering the spectrum of low - lying gluonic excitations .",
    "we will therefore restrict the quasi - gluon fock space to a the single particle sector and fit the expectation value of the mean field coulomb interaction to the ground state @xmath0 energy  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the basics of the mean field coulomb gauge approach and describe the relevant interactions . in section iii we present out results for the spectrum . a summary and outlook are given in section iv .",
    "the derivation of qcd in the coulomb gauge is given in  @xcite .",
    "the canonical approach is to start from @xmath44 the weyl gauge and using the residual gauge freedom perform a coordinate transformation to coordinates @xmath45 constrained to satisfy @xmath46 and @xmath47 phases @xmath48 , @xmath49 . in the new coordinates gauss s law can be used to eliminate the dependence on the gauge phases and in the shrdinger representation the qcd spectrum is formally obtained by solving @xmath50 \\psi_n[{\\bf a}^a ]   = e_n \\psi_n[{\\bf a}^a],\\ ] ] with the canonical momenta , @xmath51 , satisfying @xmath52 = -i \\delta_{ab}\\delta^{ij}_t(\\bm{\\nabla})\\delta^3(\\x-\\y)$ ] where @xmath53 .",
    "the coordinate transformation from the weyl gauge to the coulomb gauge is nonlinear and leads to the faddeev - popov ( fp ) determinant in the space of the field configurations , @xmath54 , where , @xmath55 .",
    "more discussion of the topological properties of the fundamental domain of the gauge variables can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the role of fp determinant has been investigated in  @xcite where it was found that it can be effectively absorbed into the parametrization of the vacuum wave functional . in the following",
    "we will thus set @xmath56 and use the ansatz for the variational ( unnormalized ) vacuum wave functional of the form ,",
