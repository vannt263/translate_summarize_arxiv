    "electrokinetics(ek ) in fluid is a classical subject defined as the study on the interaction of ions with the solid interface , and the dynamics of ions in fluid under external fields  @xcite .",
    "the roots of the ek study are very broad and can be stemmed from various disciplines for decades , such as chemistry , biology , physics , and material sciences . with the development of nano technologies , the structure scale used to confine liquid can be narrowed from micro to nano .",
    "the increase of the surface - to - volume ratio in low dimensional structures leads to new ek behaviors  @xcite .",
    "those new ek phenomena can be applied to molecular manipulation , drug mixing , and electro - osmosis , etc , which stimulates the ek study experiencing a strong revival  @xcite .",
    "+ it is well known that the ions at the liquid - solid interface attract counter ions to form electric double layers(edl ) in liquid  @xcite . as an example of water at @xmath3 ,",
    "silanol groups at the silica - water interface defined as the stern layer attract @xmath4 ions staying in the neighborhood of the interface by the electrostatic interaction .",
    "the edl is known to play a key role in the ek behaviors . in order to study the charge distribution in the edl ,",
    "a conventional method is to solve the poisson - boltzmann(pb ) equation  @xcite . to solve the pb equation ,",
    "two main types of boundary conditions are adopted .",
    "one type boundary condition is called the gouy - chapmann(gc ) model , in which a surface charge density is assumed at the interface .",
    "the other model is to define a @xmath0 potential as the boundary condition at the slip plane , where the counter ion starts its density extending into the fluid domain .",
    "the @xmath0 potential is an important physical parameter , which reflects the surface charge density and the strength of the ek behaviors .",
    "the @xmath0 potential can be measured indirectly by three main techniques .",
    "one is to determine the @xmath0 potential by measuring electroosmotic mobility combined with the expression of smoluchowski velocity  @xcite .",
    "the second is by measuring the streaming current or streaming potential  @xcite .",
    "the last is by measuring electrophoresis behaviors of colloidal particles in liquid  @xcite .",
    "+ in the solving of pb equation , @xmath0 potential as the boundary condition is considered to be a constant .",
    "similarly in the gc model , the surface charge density of the silanol groups is also considered to be pre - existing constant .",
    "the results based on either of the two models are contradictory to the experimental observations  @xcite . in aqueous electrolyte ,",
    "the @xmath0 potential and the surface charge density as well are functional of the densities of acid , alkali and salt added into the liquid . for convenience , minus of logarithmic density of @xmath4 ions ( salt ) is denoted by ph ( pc ) throughout this paper . at a certain ph",
    ", the @xmath0 potential can be measured to be zero where the ph takes its name of iso - electric point(iep ) . even though there still has no direct measurements on the surface charge density , the zero @xmath0 potential at iep",
    "is understood to be attributed to the neutralization of the surface charge density by the acid .",
    "the iep has been observed experimentally for a long time .",
    "but it is still lack of a theoretical tool to reveal the occurrence of charge neutralization at iep .",
    "one effective method with a name of charge regulation model(crm ) has been proposed to study the edl by fitting the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "however , the crm has not been used to account for the charge neutralization at iep .",
    "+ recently , a surface potential trap model has been proposed to provide a new perspective on the formation of edl in liquid  @xcite .",
    "this model is established in the framework of charge conservation . the surface charge density or the @xmath0 potential",
    "is not fixed as the boundary conditions in the model .",
    "they can vary as the ph or pc changes in the liquid .",
    "the model has also taken into account the dissociation of water molecules , which has been supported by the reactive molecular dynamics simulation  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will use the potential trap model to reveal the mechanism of the charge neutralization at iep .",
    "a cylindrical channel is considered in this work with a radius of @xmath5 and an infinite length . in this study ,",
    "the channel surface is silica and the liquid filled in the channel is water .",
    "the acid and alkali are used to adjust the ph and salt is added to change the pc . in such system ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath6 ions can be not only from the acid and alkali , but also from the dissociation of water molecules .",
    "the reactive molecular dynamics simulation shows that on a freshly cut silica surface there exist dangling bonds , si and si - o .",
    "one neutral water molecule can dissociate into an @xmath7 and an @xmath4 when contacting the dangling bonds  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath4 ions combine with si and si - o to form two silanol groups , which are unstable in an aqueous environment .",
    "silanol groups at the silica surface contacting water are dissociated , leaving @xmath8 ions at the solid surface and @xmath4 in liquid .",
    "we skip over the detail of the local chemical reaction at the interface , and propose a surface potential trap to simulate the dangling bonds at the interface physically .",
    "the trap height is influenced by the chemical environment of the liquid , such as pc and ph .",
    "however , this work will not be focused on the relation between the trap height and the chemical environment , but rather on the mechanism of charge neutralization at iep .",
    "thus , we will fix the trap height as a constant at each pc .",
    "it should be noted that the net charges of @xmath4 and @xmath6 can be nonzero at @xmath9 , which can be neutralized by the buffer ions . as an example , if @xmath10 is used to decrease the ph of water , then @xmath11 is the buffer ion .",
    "and the @xmath12 is the buffer ion if @xmath13 is used as the alkali . for convenience ,",

    "@xmath27 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath28 refers to the room temperature in this work . here",

    "the parameters of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are used in the equation to exhibit the bulk limit ion density of @xmath4 and @xmath6 renormalized by the @xmath30 in the case of @xmath9 .",
    "the relevant mass action law for the deprotonation reaction reveals @xmath34 the potential trap takes the following function @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the potential trap width , approximating the length of dangling bond @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the potential trap height . in this work ,",
    "we neglect the precise relation between the @xmath38 and pc or ph , and we use @xmath39 at @xmath40 .",
    "since the salt and buffer ions are charge conserved , the @xmath18 and @xmath17 should be governed by @xmath41 in the cylindrical coordinator  @xcite . here , @xmath42 is the salt concentration , having the value of @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 is the potential trap at the liquid - solid interface seen by the salt ions . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are introduced for the positive and negative buffer ion densities respectively .",
    "the buffer ion densities should neutralize the net charges of @xmath4 and @xmath6 , leading to explicit expressions as @xmath47 for @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for @xmath50 . in this study",
    ", we use monovalent salt with @xmath51 , and set @xmath52 for simplicity .",
    "+ owing to the charge neutralization , the integration of the right hand side of the eq.([poisson ] ) over the whole computation domain should be zero , leading to the chemical potential expressed as @xmath53\\ ] ] for both @xmath54 and @xmath55 cases .",

    "surface charge density related to the dissociation has been defined and noted as @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the @xmath4 and @xmath6 ions respectively . due to the charge conservation , @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "can be solved from the following equations @xmath63 to get @xmath64.\\ ] ] the equality of @xmath65 is consistent to the dissociation process of water molecules in which the dissociated charges of @xmath4 and @xmath6 ions should be equal to each other . in the following",
    ", we will use one parameter @xmath66 to replace the two denotations of @xmath61 and @xmath62 since @xmath65 .",
    "+ the total surface charge density of @xmath6 trapped at the interface is denoted by @xmath67 , which represents the integral of @xmath16 in the potential trap @xmath68 it should be noted that the salt ions also can enter into the potential trap at large pc .",
    "however , such mount of salt ions in the trap make little influence on the @xmath0 potential and the obtained results .",
    "thus , we consider the stern layer comprising of only @xmath6 and exclude the salt ions out of the trap .",
    "another important surface charge density denoted as @xmath69 is related to the @xmath6 ions density in bulk limit .",
    "suppose all the @xmath6 ions in the bulk limit liquid are trapped at the interface , then @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70",
    "the cylindrical channel used for the calculation is with @xmath71 to avoid the overlap of debye layer . in the calculation , the trap height is @xmath39 for @xmath72 .",
    "results presented in fig .",
    "1 show the absolute values of @xmath0 potentials decrease with the decrease of ph . at @xmath73 ,",
    "the @xmath0 potentials go to zero , which is consistent to the experimental measurement of iep  @xcite . with the increase of the ph , the absolute values also increase . after experiencing a nearly plateau ,",
    "the @xmath0 potentials then start jumping to large absolute values at @xmath74 .",
    "such @xmath0 potential behaviors in the figure have captured the main feature of the relation between the @xmath0 potentials and ph measured by experiments , except the latter shows an obvious linearity  @xcite .",
    "the deviation of the calculated results away from the linearity is attributed to our neglect of the precise relation between the trap height and the local chemical environment at various ph and pc values .",
    "the study on the precise relation is not in the scope of this work , since we only concern about the mechanism of the charge neutralization at iep .",

    "1 , the surface charge densities at @xmath77 have been calculated in fig .",
    "@xmath66 representing the mount of @xmath6 contributed from the water dissociation reaches its maximum at @xmath3 , and decreases when @xmath78 is away from 7 , no matter if the ph increases or decreases .",
    "the decrease of @xmath66 at @xmath9 is due to the mass action law . at iep",
    ", @xmath66 is zero within the calculation error , meaning that enough high @xmath4 density at iep suppresses the produce of @xmath4 from the water dissociation .",
    "@xmath69 has been referred to the @xmath6 ion density in bulk limit trapped totally at the interface .",
    "logarithmic value of @xmath69 is observed to be linearly increasing with the increase of ph due to the increase of @xmath6 ion density in bulk , and can be negligible when @xmath79 .",
    "the physical properties of the edl basically is determined by the @xmath67 . in the figure",
    ", it shows that the curve of @xmath67 overlaps that of @xmath66 when @xmath80 and meets the @xmath69 curve when @xmath2 .",
    "that means there exist two sources contributing to the charges in the stern layer . at @xmath81 ,",
    "the charges in the stern layer are mainly originated from the dissociation of water molecules .",
    "and at @xmath2 , the charges in the stern layer are mainly from the bulk liquid .",
    "since the @xmath66 is zero at @xmath73 due to the mass action law , no charges can be trapped in the stern layer , leading to the zero @xmath0 potential at iep .",
    "it also indicates in the fig .",
    "1 that the @xmath0 potential jumps to a large absolute value at @xmath74 due to the existence of enough @xmath6 ions in bulk liquid .",
    "what is more , it should be noted that the @xmath67 and @xmath0 potential in the case of @xmath82 can not go to infinity , and should be limited by two constraints .",
    "one constraint is due to the limited capacity of potential trap itself .",
    "the other is due to the limited lattices at the silica surface .",
    "the latter can also be understood as the steric effect .",
    "if the limitations are considered , the @xmath67 and @xmath0 potentials will reach a plateau at @xmath82 .",

    "the surface charge density is not large enough to give an experimentally observable @xmath0 potential , which has been confirmed by the @xmath69 curve in the fig .",
    "2(a ) . instead",
    ", the potential trap model can give the answer that the source for the surface charge at the ph close to iep is from the dissociation of water molecules , and at the iep the dissociation process is suppressed due to the mass action law .",

    "that means salt concentration into the water can help to activate the water dissociation , but decrease the @xmath0 potential ( fig.1 ) .",
    "such phenomena can be understood as the following .",
    "suppose a fixed charge density at the interface , the electric field magnitude at the slip plane can be obtained by using the gaussian law .",
    "such electric field would penetrate the debye layer to the cylinder center , resulting in a potential drop .",
    "since the potential has been fixed to be zero at the interface as the boundary condition , the potential at the cylinder center denoted as @xmath83 should be positive with the consideration that the debye layer comprises of positive charges .",
    "the @xmath83 is the exact value equal to the absolute value of the @xmath0 potential .",
    "it is well known that the add of salt into water can decrease the thickness of debye layer . with the increase of the salt concentration in water ,",
    "the decrease of the debye layer will decrease the @xmath83 if the electric field is fixed at the slip plane as a constant before entering into the debye layer .",
    "then , according to the boltzmann distribution , the decrease of positive @xmath83 will attract more positive charges in the debye layer , which is realized by the increase of the surface negative charge density in the stern layer .",
    "thus , the decrease of pc can increase @xmath66 , but the whole effect of the thickness decreasing of debye layer results in the decrease of @xmath0 potential .",
    "+ it has also been found that @xmath66 is strongly dependent on the trap height @xmath38 , shown in fig.3(a ) .",

    "the relation between the @xmath0 potential and @xmath38 or @xmath5 can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the potential trap model has been used to study the mechanism of the surface charge neutralization at iep .",
    "it is found that at iep the decrease of the charge density at the interface is due to the suppress of the water dissociation , instead of the neutralization by acid .",

    "<S> iso - electric point(iep ) is the ph , at which the @xmath0 potential is measured to be zero . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of iep has been understood due to the neutralization of surface charge density ( scd ) at the solid - liquid interface . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we use the potential trap model to study the sources of the surface charge density at verious pc and ph , by taking the water - silica system as an example . </S>",
    "<S> it is revealed that in the case of @xmath1 , the scd is mainly originated from the dissociation of water molecules . and the bulk ions trapped at the interface can dominate the scd when @xmath2 . due to the mass action law , the dissociation of water molecules is suppressed at the ph close to iep , leading to a zero surface charge density . in this way , zero @xmath0 potential is obtained at the iep . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been obtained that the increase of the salt concentration in the water can decrease the @xmath0 potential , but increase the surface charge density .    </S>",
