    "an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) generates the squeezed state entanglement between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes in both the horizontal ( @xmath9 ) and the vertical ( @xmath10 ) polarizations , resulting in a pair of beams equally entangled in every possible polarization direction .",

    "the variable @xmath12 defines the degree of squeezing , and thus the amount of entanglement of the state .",
    "it may be worth noting that this entangled state can be written as a product state of two entangled states for any pair of orthogonal polarizations .",

    "the choice of horizontal ( @xmath9 ) and vertical ( @xmath10 ) polarization is made to simplify the labeling .",
    "we can now apply this transfer operator to the specific case of single photon inputs . for an unknown polarization ,",
    "the input state is described by a superposition of the two basis states , @xmath21 . however , as noted above , the choice of the polarization basis is arbitrary .",
    "therefore , all polarization states are teleported equally well , and it is sufficient to derive the output statistics for the horizontally polarized input @xmath22 . as explained in more detail in ref.@xcite , the results for the fidelities and the output photon number distributions will be the same for any other input polarization .",
    "the output state for the teleportation of a single horizontally polarized qubit reads @xcite @xmath23 since this state is essentially a product state of the vacuum teleportation in the vertical polarized component and the one photon teleportation in the horizontally polarized component , we can now determine the photon statistics of the output using the results derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "the average numbers of horizontally and vertically polarized photons in the output of the teleportation can be determined by averaging the results given in eq .",
    "( [ 10out ] ) over all measurement values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the results read @xmath26 the effect of cv teleportation on the average photon numbers is simply given by an addition of @xmath27 photons to each channel .",
    "this additional intensity originates from the  quantum duty \" paid for non - maximal entanglement , as explained by braunstein et al . in the original proposal of optical cv teleportation @xcite .",
    "since the additional photons are unpolarized , the polarization fidelity of the output photons is reduced to @xmath28 as expected , this value increases from the classical teleportation limit of @xmath29 at no entanglement ( @xmath30 ) to a perfect fidelity of one at maximal entanglement ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the effect of cv teleportation on the average polarization fidelity @xmath32 is therefore easily explained by the  quantum duty \" according to braunstein et al.@xcite .",
    "however , this result does not show how the teleportation errors and the output photon number are correlated .",
    "we can now apply our more detailed results from ref.@xcite to derive this correlation and to identify the origin of the polarization errors . as shown in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the output photon number distribution of the single - mode teleportation of a single photon input is @xmath33 in the case of a zero photon input , the output photon number distribution corresponds to a thermal distribution with @xmath34 since the teleportation of the horizontally polarized photon given by eq.([10out ] ) can be written as a product of a single photon polarization in @xmath9 and a vacuum teleportation in @xmath10 , the output statistics of the two polarizations is given by the product of the probabilities given above .",
    "the joint probability thus reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total photon number in the output .",
    "it is now possible to determine the polarization fidelities for a specific number of output photons .",
    "for example , it is possible to post - select the cases where only a single photon is found in the output . as previously mentioned in @xcite , the conditional polarization fidelity @xmath37 for this post - selected output",
    "is given by @xmath38    ( 220,150 ) ( 200,145)(40,10)@xmath12 ( 60,100)(40,10)@xmath39 ( 120,55)(40,10)@xmath32 ( -10,145)(40,10)@xmath40   and the post - selected fidelity @xmath39 of the single photon output for variable entanglement parameter @xmath12.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    fig.[avepos ] shows the comparison between this post - selected fidelity and the average polarization fidelity @xmath32 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath39 is higher than @xmath32 for all values of the entanglement parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the errors that decrease the fidelity to @xmath32 originate from multi photon outputs ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "as we will discuss in the next section , this result can be interpreted in terms of the limits on quantum cloning imposed on the cloning fidelities @xmath42 of the multi photon outputs .",
    "since continuous variable teleportation does not preserve the input photon number , it is possible to detect more than one output photon in the teleportation of a single input photon . specifically , the probability @xmath43 of obtaining @xmath0 photons in the output is given by @xmath44    ( 220,150 ) ( 200,-10)(40,10)@xmath12 ( -10,145)(40,10)@xmath43 -photon output as a function entanglement parameter @xmath12 . from top to bottom , the curves show @xmath45 and @xmath46.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    fig.[pn ] shows the probabilities for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 output photons . for finite entanglement ( @xmath51 ) , there is always a non - vanishing chance of generating additional photons .",
    "however , the probabilities of obtaining high photon numbers @xmath0 decrease rapidly with increasing entanglement @xmath12 , consistent with the decrease in the average output photon number due to the reduced  quantum duty \" .    since the output photons are indistinguishable , the polarization state of the input photon is transferred equally to all of them .",
    "it is therefore possible to consider all of the @xmath0 output photons as clones of the original input photon .",
    "the conditional probability of finding any one of the @xmath0 photons in the same polarization as the input state is therefore equal to the cloning fidelity @xmath42 .",
    "this fidelity can be determined from the joint probabilities given in eq .",

    "in addition , the high @xmath0 limit is indicated by the result for @xmath55 , which is basically indistinguishable from a flat line at @xmath56 . as eq.([cloning ] )",
    "shows , all cloning fidelities @xmath42 are equal to @xmath29 for classical teleportation at @xmath30 .",
    "the fidelities increase with @xmath12 and reach their maximal value at @xmath31",
    ". however , the limit for @xmath57 can not be one for @xmath58 , because it would contradict the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "therefore , the upper limit depends on @xmath0 according to @xmath59 this upper limit is equal to the maximal cloning fidelity possible for a cloning protocol producing @xmath0 output photons from one input photon . for an infinite number of clones , this limit is equal to the teleportation fidelity of classical teleportation , as indicated by the flat line for @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ cfid2 ] .",
    "we have analyzed the cv teleportation of a single photon polarization state by applying the transfer operator formalism to two orthogonally polarized teleportation channels .",
    "the modifications of the output states due to imperfect entanglement result in an increase in the average photon number in the output due to the  quantum duty \" paid for the use of non - maximal entanglement .",
    "the average polarization fidelity of all output photons is therefore reduced by the random polarization of this  quantum duty \" .",
    "however , our results also show that the conditional polarization fidelity of the single photon transfer is much higher than the average fidelity , indicating that the polarization errors are greater in the multi - photon outputs .",
    "since the transfer of a single photon to a multi - photon output corresponds to a quantum cloning process , this observation can be understood as a result of the no cloning theorem .",
    "indeed , our detailed analysis shows that the cloning fidelities for each @xmath0 photon output approaches the maximal possible value for quantum cloning protocols as the entanglement parameter @xmath12 approaches one .",
    "a significant part of the polarization errors in the output photons thus originates from the cloning errors associated with the accidental generation of additional output photons .    from the quantum communication point of view",
    ", it seems to be quite remarkable that cv teleportation can produce nearly optimally cloned qubits as an accidental side effect of qubit teleportation . in this context",
