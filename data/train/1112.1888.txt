    "it has long been argued that sakharov s three conditions for baryogenesis @xcite ( deviation from thermal equilibrium , cp violation , and baryon number violation ) could have been met in the context of a first - order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) at the @xmath3 gev scale @xcite ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "baryon number violation in this setting would have proceeded through so - called sphaleron transitions , which are boltzmann - suppressed and become slow after the ewpt at @xmath4 gev , with the sphaleron energy @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the higgs vev . in a first - order transition",
    "separate regions of the old and the new phase coexist , with bubbles of the new phase nucleating and expanding in the old phase until they fill all space .",
    "baryon number violation would have taken place outside the growing bubbles , and then the baryon asymmetry would have been transported across the bubble wall into the new phase , where it must avoid annihilation by washout processes .",
    "this is granted by a sufficiently strong phase transition with @xmath7 @xcite , which is impossible to satisfy within the standard model for experimentally allowed values of the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "therefore extensions of the standard model , such as models with extra higgs fields @xcite or singlets @xcite , or non - standard higgs potentials @xcite are required for successful electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "the possibility of a strong electroweak phase transition in a minimal supersymmetric setting leading to the production of a baryon asymmetry consistent with observations has been studied extensively .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis has been shown to be feasible in a specific region in the supersymmetric mass parameter space .",
    "this setting is generally known as the light stop scenario ( lss ) , characterised by a ( predominantly right - handed ) light stop with a mass lighter than or comparable to that of the top quark @xcite .",
    "all other squarks and sleptons are typically taken to be at a much higher mass scale .",
    "being one more light bosonic species ( in addition to the weak gauge bosons ) that couples to the higgs , the light stop increases the upper bound on the higgs mass compatible with a strong phase transition to about 127 gev @xcite . in turn",
    ", the predominantly left - handed stop must be heavy to agree with electroweak precision tests and to provide a sufficiently heavy higgs boson .",
    "gluinos are generally considered heavy and thus decoupled from the thermal bath in order to suppress their potentially large contribution to the effective thermal light stop mass .",
    "charginos and neutralinos should remain light as they provide the only additional cp - violating currents available in this context , needed to generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "the cp - odd higgs mass is large to avoid potentially large contributions to the electric dipole moments of the electron and the neutron , leaving one light , sm - like higgs boson .",
    "a crucial parameter entering the computation of the generated baryon asymmetry @xcite is the velocity of the expanding bubble walls , @xmath8 . in particular , it is essential that the wall velocity is smaller than the speed of sound in the plasma , so that diffusion of charges from the bubble wall into the symmetric phase is possible ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent proposal for supersonic electroweak baryogenesis ) .",
    "the wall velocity is determined by the friction induced by the motion of the bubble through the plasma , and by the pressure difference across the bubble wall .",
    "microscopically , friction is related to deviations from equilibrium in the plasma . in a semiclassical approximation",
    "this effect can be described by a set of boltzmann equations coupled to the equations of motion of the higgs field .",
    "such a system of equations was written down and solved for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of small higgs masses in the minimal standard model . later on the computation was generalized to the lss in ref .",
    "while the typical wall velocity in the standard model was found to be @xmath9 , its value in the lss was determined to be almost an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "this is due to additional friction induced by the light stops",
    ".    ref .",
    "@xcite makes use of the thermal higgs potential in 1-loop approximation , while 2-loop corrections are known to be vital to obtain a strong phase transtion for realistic higgs masses @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend the computation of the wall velocity in the lss to the case of the 2-loop thermal potential , resulting in a sufficiently strong phase transition for experimentally allowed higgs masses around and above 115 gev .    rather than repeating the microscopic analysis of friction from the literature , we model friction by a single friction parameter , which we fix by matching to ref .",
    "@xcite and extrapolate it to our higgs mass range of interest . as we will show such an approach leads to a much simpler set of equations , basically relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to the equation of motion of the higgs field @xcite .",
    "this method has been successfully used in ref .",
    "@xcite to numerically simulate bubble growth .",
    "the main idea of our work is that friction is mainly related to interactions between the wall and the hot plasma , and does therefore hardly change when higher - order corrections are included in the thermal potential .",
    "on the other hand , friction would indeed change significantly , if the composition of the plasma would change , e.g. by removing the light stops .",
    "we will show that the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite carries over to the 2-loop case : bubble walls in the lss move very slowly , @xmath0 , far below the speed of sound in the medium .",
    "this is also true for higgs masses around and above 115 gev , and for a phase transition strong enough to avoid baryon number washout . as a by - product",
    "we also arrive at a more reliable determination of the strength of the phase transition , reading off the higgs vev inside a realistic bubble , including effects of reheating , rather than taking it from the minimum of the thermal potential at the critical temperature .",
    "thus we find that the relevant value of @xmath10 is increased by about 10% .",
    "we treat the problem of the moving bubble wall by modelling the hot plasma as a perfect relativistic fluid , assuming conservation of its energy - momentum tensor , which is the sum of the separate contributions from the fluid and the higgs field @xcite : @xmath11 here @xmath12 the energy density , @xmath13 the pressure , and @xmath14 the usual minkowski metric .",
    "stationary solutions to the problem of the expanding bubble wall are usually divided into two categories depending on whether the wall advances at a velocity above or below the speed of sound in the medium @xcite . in subsonic solutions ( deflagrations )",
    "the bubble wall is preceded by a shock front that accelerates and heats up the plasma , which is brought to rest by the bubble wall passing through . in supersonic solutions ( detonations )",
    "the plasma is hit by the bubble wall while at rest and accelerated , and is brought back to rest by a rarefaction wave which follows the wall .",
    "for the purposes of this work velocities remain well below the speed of sound and we will have no cause to explore supersonic solutions to the hydrodynamic equations .    it is convenient to work with the stress - energy conservation equation in the rest frame of the expanding bubble wall , picking the radial direction and approximating the situation at the bubble wall as planar .",
    "we are left with one spatial coordinate and no time dependence . applying the relevant thermodynamic relations and introducing our friction coefficient @xmath15 we arrive at the coupled system @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the scalar field , @xmath6 is the fluid velocity , @xmath18 the temperature , @xmath19 the relativistic factor @xmath20 , @xmath21 the plasma temperature in the symmetric phase ahead of the advancing wall , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are integration constants best determined in the symmetric phase where most contributions vanish .",
    "the radiative pressure is @xmath24 , @xmath25 being the number of effective degrees of freedom in the plasma at the temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the special form of the friction term in ( [ eqn : fluid1 ] ) is motivated by the microscopic analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this system can be solved numerically across the bubble wall by imposing vanishing @xmath17 derivatives at both boundaries of the integration interval and vanishing higgs vev in the symmetric phase .",
    "we continue the computation of the bubble profile by solving the hydrodynamic equation in the region between the bubble wall and the shock front , for which we drop the planar approximation and take into account the sphericity of the bubble ( note that on this step we are already in the symmetric phase where we take @xmath26 ) .",
    "lastly we solve the conservation equation across the shock front to relate our findings to the temperature of the universe unperturbed by the bubble @xcite .    as usual",
    ", a first - order phase transition is indicated by the effective potential at the relevant temperature , which has a global minimum at zero higgs vev , developing a second local minimum at nonzero vev as the temperature of the universe decreases ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as @xmath18 keeps decreasing the value of @xmath27 at the second minimum approaches the value of the symmetric minimum .",
    "the minima become degenerate at the so - called critical temperature , @xmath28 .",
    "nucleation of bubbles of the new phase becomes possible for @xmath29 .",
    "the phase transition is deemed to begin once the integrated probability of bubble nucleation in the horizon volume @xmath30 reaches unity , at the nucleation temperature @xmath31 ( here we have taken @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the free energy of the so - called critical bubble , just large enough to spontaneously grow without collapsing under surface tension , at the temperature @xmath18 ) .",
    "once bubbles begin to nucleate they grow and occupy the whole space very quickly , ending the phase transition .",
    "the wall velocity of expanding bubbles of the broken symmetry phase in a 1st - order electroweak phase transition was calculated microscopically for the standard model by moore and prokopec @xcite and for the mssm , based on the same procedure , by john and schmidt @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for one scalar background field coupled to the distribution functions of the particles in the plasma is @xcite @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the renormalised vacuum potential , the sum is over all particle species , and the mass dependence of each particle on the higgs vev is given by its respective couplings .",
    "the vacuum potential combines with the equilibrium part of the particle distribution to produce the finite - temperature effective potential @xmath36 .",
    "the equation of motion can then be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 expresses the deviation from equilibrium of the relevant particle populations , which is responsible for the wall friction .",
    "the evolution of the particle populations , in the semiclassical approximation , is given by boltzmann equations of the form @xmath39;\\ ] ] @xmath40 $ ] being the _ collision integral_. these boltzmann equations together with the equation of motion for the scalar field constitute a very complicated set of coupled integro - differential equations , which is very difficult to solve .",
    "several simplifications are possible in order to solve the equation of motion . taking @xmath40\\equiv0 $ ] constitutes the free particle approximation . in this approach",
    "the boltzmann equation can be solved exactly @xcite and @xmath41 integrated over momentum .",
    "recently this approximation was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to show that under certain circumstances the bubble wall velocity may approach the speed of light . in the relaxation time",
    "approximation @xmath40\\equiv(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\tau})$ ] , with @xmath42 independent of momentum .",
    "this approach becomes particularly simple if @xmath43 with @xmath44 the wall thickness , because then the spatial derivatives of @xmath45 can be neglected .",
    "the approach first followed by moore and prokopec for the standard model @xcite , then by john and schmidt for the mssm @xcite ( the fluid approximation ) describes @xmath41 for each relevant particle as an equilibrium distribution where @xmath46 is modified by perturbations , @xmath47 where @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "it is sufficient to treat in this way only heavy species which couple strongly to the higgs ( top quarks , w bosons , and z bosons for the standard model , and additionally right - handed stops in the mssm ) .",
    "note that in the mssm , as mentioned , other ( superheavy ) particles are taken as decoupled from the plasma and show up only in the shape of the effective vacuum potential of the theory .",
    "the treatment of light particles is simplified by treating them as one species with common perturbations to the equilibrium chemical potential , temperature and fluid velocity @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( as opposed to the individual perturbations for heavy species @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .    with this approximation the boltzmann equation for each particle species",
    "can be expanded to linear order in the perturbations and then @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 integrations carried out .",
    "this , plus the fluid equation , constitutes the system to be solved numerically .. in that case a fluid equation for each scalar field formally identical to ( [ eqn : fluid1 ] ) is produced with a calculable friction parameter @xmath15 . ]",

    "@xcite used the thermal higgs potential in the 1-loop approximation and was therefore not able to have a strong phase transition at realistic higgs masses .",

    "we find a wall velocity @xmath113 , not very different from the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for much weaker phase transitions .",
    "the obtained friction coefficient is roughly 5 to 10 times larger than what is found in an sm - like situation @xcite .",
    "it could also be used to treat e.g.  the case of an additional singlet scalar field being added to the light stop scenario .",
    "our result confirms the expectation of slowly moving bubble walls in the light stop scenario , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath114 was found , using a simplified microscopic model of friction .",
    "having computed the full scalar profile of the expanding bubble , we can more reliably check the criterion for avoiding baryon number washout , by taking the true higgs field value and temperature inside the expanding bubble , rather than relying on the equilibrium potential at the critical temperature . this way the phase transitions turns out to be about 10% stronger .",
    "the wall velocity is not only crucial for the generated baryon asymmetry , but also for the production of gravitational waves ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the gravitational wave signal goes down with the wall velocity , and should therefore not be observable for the mssm electroweak phase transition .    finally , we will treat the non - supersymmetric case in more detail in ref .  @xcite .",
