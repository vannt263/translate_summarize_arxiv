    "merging stochastic dynamics within the formal structure of relativity ( special or general ) is a relevant issue in theoretical physics ( field theory ) with important implication in high - energy physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is a challenging issue , due to causality and to the formal constraints of the minkowskian structure of the space - time , imposed by the boundedness of the propagation velocity of physical processes , that forces to consider space and time variable on equal footing .",
    "the limit imposed by the constant value of the velocity of light _ in vacuo _ , implies the any consistent relativistic stochastic process should possess bounded propagation velocity and , as a consequence of this , an almost everywhere smooth structure of the space - time trajectories .    the works by dudley @xcite and hakim @xcite elucidated further the subtleties of the relativistic formulation of stochastic processes .",
    "the most relevant constraint is the impossibility of a strictly markovian process in the minkowski space - time . as observed by dudley @xcite , the structure of the minkowsky space - time forces to include information on the velocity in specifying the state of a stochastic process .",
    "this general and significant observation can be interpreted and followed in two conceptually different ways in order to define relativistic models of brownian motion .",
    "the first strategy is to build up a relativistic version of ornstein - uhlenbeck processes in the @xmath8-space @xcite , that is the cartesian product of the minkowski space - time @xmath9 times the @xmath10 space of the 4-velocities .",
    "this is the strategy adopted in defining the so - called relativistic ornstein - uhlenbeck process by debbasch et al .",
    "@xcite , and the relativistic brownian motion by dunkel and hnggi @xcite .",
    "these classes of models represent ornstein - uhlenbeck processes , i.e. , langevin equations for the position and the momentum of a particle driven by a stochastic force in the presence of a friction contribution .",
    "the stochastic force is modelled in the form of a wiener process , and the momentum - dependent prefactors accounting for the lorentz covariance , modulating both the friction and the intensity of the stochastic perturbations , can be derived from the stationary relativistic velocity distribution , expressed by the juttner distribution @xcite ( or by the modified juttner distribution ) , corresponding to the stationary solution of the relativistic boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "a central limit theorem for these families of relativistic processes is developed in @xcite .",
    "all these models describe a stochastic dynamics but not a stochastic kinematics , i.e. , a stochastic process involving exclusively space - time coordinates that , according to the above observation by dudley and hakim can not be grounded on a strict markovian model .",
    "the way for approaching a relativistically consistent stochastic kinematic model , is to consider a system of bounded velocities , the selection of which is controlled by a markov - chain process .",
    "this is the essence of poisson - kac processes , introduced by marc kac @xcite and further elaborated by many authors @xcite . for a general review of the different approaches in relativistic stochastic analysis see @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to analyze the ( special ) relativistic transformation of stochastic kinematics , and specifically the transformation of the tensor diffusivity induced by a lorentz boost .",
    "albeit this issue is of general relevance both in theory and applications , it has never been addressed in the literature , to the best of the author s knowledge .",
    "a possible explanation of this lack stems from the fact that for relativistic stochastic processes a @xmath8-space formulation has been followed , and the resulting nonlinear langevin equations in @xmath11 are fairly complex and not easily amenable to a closed - form analysis of the associated diffusivity tensor .    in this article , using different approaches and relativistic stochastic processes ( poisson - kac processes , discrete space - time diffusion models recently studied in @xcite , etc . )",
