    "giant flares in soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are some of the most energetic astrophysical events .",
    "the total energy released during a flare is @xmath0 ergs , and flares are considered to be powered by a global reconfiguration of magnetic field @xmath1 g in a magnetar ( for a review ) .",
    "global seismic oscillations of the stellar crust are likely to be associated with flares@xcite .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are observed in the decaying tails of the flares of sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 , and their frequencies are in the range of 10-@xmath2 hz , which are interpreted as the frequencies of torsional oscillations with some harmonic numbers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the typical frequency of the torsional shear mode is @xmath3hz , which is estimated from the shear modulus , density at the crust and stellar radius .",
    "more realistic treatment is necessary for the actual fitting . in particular , considering the effects of strong magnetic fields , which couple core and crust , is essential .",
    "a number of researchers have been exploring the oscillations of strongly magnetized stars ( @xcite and references therein ) . in spite of substantial improvements in oscillation theory ,",
    "there is considerable uncertainty about the processes behind x- and gamma - ray radiation phenomena .",
    "main peaks in the power spectrum may correspond to the oscillation frequency , but their amplitudes and decays should be affected by the surrounding magnetosphere .",
    "@xcite showed that an oscillating magnetized star should have a magnetosphere filled with charge - separated plasma so that the longitudinal electric field ( parallel to the magnetic field ) in vacuum is screened .",
    "this situation resembles that of a pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "rotation in pulsars is replaced by oscillation in magnetized stars .",
    "the induced charge density has been calculated as a generalization of the well - known goldreich - julian density for pulsars @xcite . in the almost analytic treatment in @xcite ,",
    "the current is assumed to be zero everywhere . in magnetar flares ,",
    "large current associated with a magnetic twist @xmath4 is expected to flow out from the surface .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider the effects of flowing current on the magnetosphere .",
    "the calculations necessary to consistently determine the charge and current densities induced by the oscillation are more complex , requiring time - dependent numerical simulations .",
    "one approach is to perform relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations .",
    "however , this approach is rather difficult in the case of strong magnetic regimes , such as that in magnetars , since plasma effects are less important .",
    "recently , a new numerical approach was proposed for the construction of pulsar magnetospheres@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the maxwell equations are solved for the current modeled using ohm s law , and particle acceleration as well as the generation of radiation are relevant to the electric field component parallel to the magnetic field , that is , @xmath5 .",
    "thus , such dissipative effects of non - ideal mhd are taken into account in the model , which differs from the force - free electrodynamics approach , in which plasma can be approximated as massless and ideal mhd conditions are assumed to hold everywhere .",
    "we adopt the same resistive electrodynamics approach in order to simulate global structures in the flares .",
    "the electromagnetic fields outside a star are disturbed by periodic torsional motion , which is horizontal at the surface .",
    "there is no justification for the use of resistive electrodynamics since the portion of plasma energy with respect to electromagnetic energy ejected from the surface is unknown .",
    "moreover , the physical conditions relevant to qpo phenomena of the flares is uncertain .",
    "non - thermal x- and gamma - rays in pulsars originate from the effects of non - ideal mhd , namely accelerating electric fields .",
    "it is therefore a reasonable first step to simulate the disturbances in the magnetosphere by analogy with pulsars , in whose framework non - ideal mhd is allowed .",
    "the results are expected to provide useful insight into observed phenomena and to lead to further improvement of theoretical models .",

    "<S> the fields are drastically modified , and energy flux is thereby enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is however localized in the vicinity of the surface since the induced current disappears outwardly in our model , in which the exterior is assumed to gradually approach a vacuum . </S>"
