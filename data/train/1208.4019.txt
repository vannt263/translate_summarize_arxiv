    "we prove :    [ thm : git ] with notation as above , there is an `` attaching '' morphism @xmath19 the projective embedding of the codomain restricts to the segre product of the projective embeddings of the domain quotients : @xmath20 .",
    "these git quotients have played an important role in a variety of subjects .",
    "for instance , configurations on the line are involved in deep arithmetic constructions @xcite and configurations in the plane lead naturally to moduli spaces of del pezzo surfaces @xcite . by duality",
    "these quotients parameterize hyperplane arrangements , and studying the modular compactifications one obtains in this context has revealed new insight into the minimal model program @xcite .",
    "another ubiquitous compactification of the configuration space of points on the line is the moduli space of stable rational @xmath0-pointed curves , @xmath3 .",
    "the interplay between this space and the git quotients @xmath21 has been studied in @xcite    by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) , for any @xmath22 and @xmath12 there is a morphism @xmath23 sending a configuration of distinct points on @xmath24 to the corresponding configuration under the @xmath25 veronese map .",
    "the generic point of a boundary divisor @xmath26 gets sent to a configuration supported on a union of two rational normal curves @xmath27 with @xmath28 and a node at the point @xmath29 .",
    "we define a _ git bundle _ as a line bundle on @xmath3 of the form @xmath30 , and from theorem [ thm : git ] we deduce :    [ cor : git ] the restriction of a git bundle @xmath31 to any boundary divisor in @xmath3 is of the form @xmath32 .",
    "one can view a configuration of points on the line as the set of branch points for a ramified cover , and in this way moduli of points leads naturally to moduli of positive genus algebraic curves .",
    "more specifically , given integers @xmath33 , and @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , there is a map @xmath37 sending a configuration @xmath38 to the degree @xmath39 cyclic cover ramified over @xmath40 . for @xmath41 $ ] , this is the regular model of the function field extension of @xmath42 given by @xmath43 .",
    "the genus of the cyclic cover is determined by the riemann - hurwitz formula : @xmath44 this map was studied by fedorchuk in @xcite , and he shows that it extends to a morphism @xmath45 .",
    "we prove here that the restriction of this morphism to a boundary divisor is essentially a product of morphisms of the same type :    [ thm : cyclic ] for @xmath46 with @xmath47 , there is a commutative diagram @xmath48 \\ar[dr ] \\ar[dd]_{(f_{\\underline{c}',r},f_{\\underline{c}'',r})~ } & & { \\overline{m}}_{0,n } \\ar[dd]^{f_{\\underline{c},r } } \\\\ & ( { \\overline{m}}_{g_1,s}\\times { \\overline{m}}_{g_2,s})/s_s \\ar[dr ] \\ar[dl ] & \\\\ { \\overline{m}}_{g_1}\\times { \\overline{m}}_{g_2 } & { \\overline{m}}_{g_1,s } \\times { \\overline{m}}_{g_2,s } \\ar[l]^{\\pi } \\ar[r]_{\\rho } \\ar[u ] & { \\overline{m}}_g}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the product of forgetful maps , @xmath50 is an attaching map , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",

    "they have also been used to study special subvarieties in the moduli space of abelian varieties @xcite and curves and divisors in the moduli space of curves @xcite .",
    "the restriction of the hodge bundle @xmath54 on @xmath55 to various cyclic cover loci plays an important role in several of these applications . by studying the hodge bundles in the above theorem",
    ", we deduce :    [ cor : hodge ] the restriction of @xmath56 to any boundary divisor in @xmath3 is of the form @xmath57 .",
    "we note the structural similarity between these determinant line bundles and the git line bundles discussed earlier .",
    "this is explained in the following framework .",
    "the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) model provides an important class of 2-dimensional conformal field theories .",
    "it associates to each algebraic curve of a given genus a vector space , known as a space of conformal blocks , fitting together to form an algebraic vector bundle on the moduli stack @xmath58 .",
    "these conformal block bundles were widely studied in the 90s due to their connections with mathematical physics , algebraic geometry , and representation theory @xcite .",
    "of particular interest was the verlinde formula , which computes their rank as a function of the discrete parameters involved .",
    "most proofs of the formula are rooted in the factorization rules , describing for instance the vector space over an irreducible curve in terms of the vector spaces over the components of a reducible curve it degenerates to ( cf . ",
    "[ section : examples from wzw ] ) .",
    "a key insight was that by abstracting the factorization rules to a numerical function encoding the dimensions under this degeneration process , one can form a ring , called the fusion ring , whose representation theory encodes the information of the verlinde formula and provides an elegant way to access it ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in recent years",
    "there has been a renewed flurry of activity in the wzw model , in large part due to fakhruddin s formulae for the chern classes of conformal block bundles @xcite .",
    "these formulae provide an intersection - theoretic method for determining the isomorphism class of the associated determinant line bundles .",
    "this has revealed much insight into the geometry of these objects , particularly in the case of genus zero @xcite .",
    "we introduce an abstraction of wzw factorization that is in a sense orthogonal to that of fusion rules : the latter encode the rank of conformal block vector bundles under degeneration while discarding any extraneous information , whereas our framework only applies to rank one bundles but it encodes the isomorphism class of these line bundles .",
    "we define a _ divisorial factorization system _",
    "@xmath59 to be a collection of line bundle classes on @xmath3 , for @xmath60 , such that the restriction of any @xmath61 to any boundary divisor @xmath62 is of the form @xmath63 for @xmath64 ( see  [ section : main definitions ] ) .",
    "typically , the members of such a system are indexed by vectors assigning some weight datum to each marked point .",
    "we define a _ divisorial factorization rule _ to be a collection of functions that encode how these weights transform upon restriction to the boundary ( definition [ def : factrule ] ) .",
    "[ thm : cambridge ] if two systems admit the same divisorial factorization rule , then their line bundles are isomorphic for all @xmath65 if they are for @xmath66 .",
    "the git linearization @xmath14 provides a notion of weights for the marked points in the context of git bundles @xmath31 on @xmath3 , and by corollary [ cor : git ] these line bundles form a divisorial factorization system .",
    "similarly , the ramification vector for a cyclic cover yields weights for points on the line and corollary [ cor : hodge ] implies that the restrictions of the hodge class to these weighted cyclic cover loci form another factorization system .",
    "these hodge classes are closely related to line bundles studied by fedorchuk in @xcite , defined by first taking a @xmath67-eigenbundle decomposition of the restricted hodge bundle and then considering the determinants of these direct summands . in this paper",
    "we prove that these line bundles , which we call _ cyclic bundles _ , also form a divisorial factorization system , and moreover the following remarkable property holds : the divisorial factorization rule for git bundles , cyclic bundles , and a certain class of conformal block ( cb ) line bundles all coincide .",
    "consequently , we obtain a new proof of the following :    [ thm : main ] fix @xmath68 , and @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath36 .",
    "the following line bundles on @xmath3 are isomorphic :    * the level 1 , @xmath71 conformal block bundle with fundamental weights @xmath72 ; * the pullback of @xmath73 along the map @xmath74 sending a configuration of points on the line to the corresponding configuration on a rational normal curve ; * the @xmath75 tensor power of the determinant of the unit character @xmath67-eigenbundle of the hodge bundle on the locus of ramified degree @xmath39 cyclic covers with branch points weighted by @xmath14 .    indeed",
    ", standard results apply for the case @xmath76 , so we simply apply theorem [ thm : cambridge ] .",
    "the identification of cb bundles with git bundles was first proven in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) , whereas the identification with cyclic bundles was first proven in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.5 ) . in both cases",
    "the proof relies on computing the degree of the restriction to rational curves in the boundary known as f - curves .",
    "once the formulae for these degrees are obtained , the problem reduces to a completely numerical / combinatorial one , namely , showing that the three degree formulae coincide . beyond this previously observed numerical coincidence of divisor classes , our proof using factorization shows that the isomorphisms in theorem [ thm : main ] reflect a common functoriality in these three constructions .",
    "one can extend our notion of divisorial factorization to higher rank vector bundles and to positive genus @xmath58 by mimicking the statement of wzw factorization in that setting .",
    "it would be interesting to find geometric constructions of vector bundles that factorize and to compare them with conformal block vector bundles , as in the case of theorem [ thm : main ] for rank one and genus zero .",

    "in this section we introduce the notion of divisorial factorization , prove that it can be used to encode picard group classes through a simple induction , and provide examples coming from the wzw model .      for any @xmath77 with @xmath78 ,",
    "there is a boundary divisor inclusion map @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the complementary index set .",
    "this yields a restriction homomorphism @xmath81 another map of picard groups that we will use throughout is @xmath82 defined by @xmath83 .",
    "this latter map is an isomorphism , as one can check with the knneth formula , though we will not need this fact .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we assume for notational convenience that an index set @xmath84 of cardinality @xmath85 is of the form @xmath86 .",
    "a _ divisorial factorization system _ is a subset @xmath87 that is closed under boundary restriction : if @xmath61 is in @xmath88 for some @xmath89 , and @xmath77 satisfies @xmath90 , then @xmath91 for some @xmath92 .",
    "given a set @xmath93 , we say that the system @xmath59 is @xmath93-_weighted _ if there exists @xmath94 such that @xmath95 .",
    "we then call @xmath96 an @xmath93-_weighting _ for @xmath59 .    to define an @xmath93-weighting on a system",
    ", we will frequently describe the maps @xmath97 only for certain vectors @xmath98 ; as such , we implicitly take the trivial line bundle class as the image of all other vectors .",
    "the interpretation of this definition is that an @xmath93-weighting provides a way of specifying a line bundle on @xmath3 by specifying an element of @xmath93 for each marked point .",
    "the restriction of this line bundle to a boundary divisor is then determined by an element of @xmath93 for each marked point as before , plus elements of @xmath93 for each of the two attaching points .",

    "indeed , in this situation @xmath130 has rank at most one @xcite , so the direct sum in theorem [ thm : fakfact ] has at most one nonzero term , thus a cb line bundle pulls back to a product of cb line bundles .",
    "[ factrules - cb ] to illustrate weight data and factorization rules , let us fix @xmath129 and @xmath131 .",

    ", traversing the diagram in either direction corresponds to sending a nodal curve @xmath279 to a union of two rational normal curves in @xmath280 with a node at the attaching point @xmath281 .",
    "it follows from the explicit description of @xmath271 and of the morphisms in @xcite that the resulting configurations are projectively equivalent .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ thm : cyclic ] and corollary [ cor : hodge ] and discuss the eigenbundle determinants studied by fedorchuk .",

    "see figure [ fig : attach ] for an example .",
    "we will also consider the product of forgetful maps @xmath289 .",
    "[ pullbacks ] there is an isomorphism of vector bundles @xmath290    this is standard and has appeared in the literature in various forms .",

    "the cyclic cover morphisms @xmath291 mentioned in  [ section : cyclicintro ] are most easily defined on the interior @xmath292 , and fedorchuk in @xcite describes two ways to see the extension to the stable compactification @xmath3 .",
    "one method is via orbicurves and essentially shows that the extension is obtained by taking a degree @xmath39 cyclic cover of the universal curve not of @xmath3 itself but of a dm - stack lying over @xmath3 , namely fedorchuk s moduli space of @xmath39-divisible curves .",
    "these @xmath39-divisible curves are orbicurves whose coarse moduli space is a marked stable rational curve . the second method to see the extension is via the harris - mumford theory of admissible covers : to compute the limit of a family of cyclic covers , take the limit in the compactified hurwitz scheme of admissible covers @xcite .",
    "we will use the latter perspective to prove to theorem [ thm : cyclic ] . to begin ,",
    "let us see what happens to smooth cyclic covers as they degenerate in the simplest possible way :    [ lem : limit ] let @xmath293 be the admissible cover obtained as the limit of cyclic covers @xmath294 ramified over @xmath295 as @xmath296 tends to the generic point @xmath297 of a boundary divisor @xmath298 .",
    "let @xmath299 and @xmath300 denote the normalizations , so @xmath301 with markings @xmath302 and @xmath303 with markings @xmath304 .",
    "then    1 .",
    "@xmath305 is a cyclic cover ramified over @xmath306 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath307 is a cyclic cover ramified over @xmath308 ; 3 .",
    "the fiber of @xmath309 over the node @xmath310 consists of @xmath311 distinct points ; 4 .",
    "the genus @xmath312 of @xmath313 satisfies @xmath314 , where @xmath315 is the genus of @xmath316 and @xmath317 is the genus of @xmath318 .    by the definition of admissible covers , the restricted maps @xmath305 and @xmath307",
    "are degree @xmath39 cyclic covers of @xmath319 .",
    "moreover , they are ramified over a weighted sum of the marked points and the attaching point @xmath310 , with weights on the marked points given by the original weight vector @xmath14 .",
    "the weight on the attaching point is then uniquely determined , up to equivalence modulo @xmath39 , by the condition that the sum of the weights for each of the two cyclic covers is divisible by @xmath39 .",
    "more precisely , since @xmath139 , it follows immediately that the weights of the attaching points must be as in the statement of the lemma .",
    "this proves the first two claims .",
    "the genus of @xmath313 is independent of @xmath320 and is given by the riemann - hurwitz formula : @xmath321 on the other hand , applying riemann - hurwitz to @xmath316 and @xmath318 yields @xmath322 @xmath323 since @xmath324 , and we call this common number @xmath288 , which is the number of nodes in the fiber over the node @xmath310 , we see that @xmath325 .",
    "this concludes the third and fourth claim .",
    "let @xmath326 denote the image of the attaching map @xmath327 from  [ sect : attach ] .",
    "the normalization of @xmath328 is @xmath329 .",
    "it follows from lemma [ lem : limit ] that the restriction of the cyclic cover morphism @xmath45 to the boundary divisor @xmath330 has image contained in @xmath328 . since @xmath330 is normal , this restriction factors through @xmath329 .",
    "we thus have a diagram as in theorem [ thm : cyclic ] which is commutative except possibly at the triangle on the left :    @xmath331 \\ar[dr ] \\ar[dd]_{(f_{\\underline{c}',r},f_{\\underline{c}'',r})~ } & & { \\overline{m}}_{0,n } \\ar[dd]^{f_{\\underline{c},r } } \\\\ & ( { \\overline{m}}_{g_1,s}\\times { \\overline{m}}_{g_2,s})/s_s \\ar[dr ] \\ar[dl ] & \\\\ { \\overline{m}}_{g_1}\\times { \\overline{m}}_{g_2 } & { \\overline{m}}_{g_1,s } \\times { \\overline{m}}_{g_2,s } \\ar[l]^{\\pi } \\ar[r]_{\\rho } \\ar[u ] & { \\overline{m}}_g}\\ ] ]    however , to check this remaining commutativity we can restrict to the dense open subset @xmath332 , where commutativity then follows from lemma [ lem : limit ] .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ thm : cyclic ] .",
    "following @xcite , we define the cyclic bundle @xmath333 by splitting the hodge bundle on the cyclic cover locus into @xmath67-eigenbundles , @xmath334 and then taking the determinant of the first eigenbundle : @xmath335 .",

    "the @xmath67-action is compatible with this decomposition , and determinants commute with base change , so @xmath340 but over a complete variety every direct summand of a trivial bundle is trivial , since endomorphisms are simply constant matrices , so the last factor on the right - hand side vanishes and we obtain the desired result .",
    "here we use the results from the previous sections to derive theorem [ thm : main ] , restated below for the convenience of the reader :        this is done by showing that all three classes of line bundles form divisorial factorization systems admitting the same factorization rule .",

    "we can assume that they are all positive , for if not then the corresponding git bundle is defined to be the trivial line bundle ; since any restriction of a trivial bundle is trivial , this is compatible with the above factorization rules .",
