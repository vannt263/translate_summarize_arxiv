    ", one can produce the flavor creation contribution in two ways with isajet , either by running them separately or by running all qcd .",
    "for herwig and pythia one must generate the flavor creation terms separately by running the heavy quark option ( iproc = 1705 or msel = 5 ) . for pythia",
    "this produces only the flavor creation contribution .",
    "however , for herwig the heavy quark option produces both the flavor creation terms and the flavor excitation terms and one must monitor the @xmath3-to-@xmath3 subprocesses to separate them .",
    "for isajet one can run the flavor excitation contribution separately or one can run all qcd and then select out the flavor excitation contribution ( one gets the same answer either way ) . for herwig running the heavy quark option gets both the flavor creation and the flavor excitation contributions ( with the @xmath0-quark mass included ) .",
    "for herwig , if one runs all qcd and then selects out the flavor excitation contribution one gets a different answer since here the @xmath0 mass is set to zero . for pythia the only way to get the flavor excitation contribution is to run all qcd and then select out the flavor excitation contribution , but here one only gets the massless approximation .",
    "actually , in leading order it is not clear how to handle the @xmath0-quark mass in the flavor excitation subprocesses since one is going from an off - shell @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) quark in the initial state to an on - shell massive @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) quark in the final state .",
    "this limits the accuracy of the leading order estimate of this contribution .",
    "for all three monte - carlo models the only way to get the shower / fragmentation contribution to @xmath0-quark production is to run all qcd @xmath3-to-@xmath3 subprocesses and then select out the shower / fragmentation contribution by monitoring the subprocesses , which requires producing large numbers of events .",
    "the shower / fragmentation contribution differs greatly among the monte - carlo models for two reasons .",
    "the first is due to different fragmentation schemes .",
    "isajet uses independent fragmentation , while herwig and pythia do not .",
    "the second difference arises from the way the qcd monte - carlo produce parton showers .",
    "isajet uses a leading - log picture in which the partons within the shower are ordered according to their invariant mass .",
    "kinematics requires that the invariant mass of daughter partons are less than the invariant mass of the parent .",
    "herwig and pythia modify the leading - log picture to include  color coherence effects \" which leads to  angle ordering \" within the parton shower .",
    "the flavor excitation and shower / fragmentation @xmath3-to-@xmath3 subprocesses diverge as the parton transverse momentum , @xmath23 , goes to zero . to get a finite result one must regulate the divergences or specify a minimum value for @xmath23 . for herwig and isajet",
