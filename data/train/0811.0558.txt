    "<S> we investigate a flat anisotropic ( 5 + 1)-dimensional cosmological model in the presence of the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) contribution in addition to usual einstein term in the action . </S>",
    "<S> we compared it with ( 4 + 1)-dimensional case and found a substantial difference in corresponding cosmological dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is manifested in the probability of the model to have smooth transition from gb - term - dominated to einstein - term - dominated phases  this probability in a reasonable measure on the initial condition space is almost zero for ( 4 + 1 ) case and about 60@xmath0 for ( 5 + 1 ) case . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this difference as well as some features of the dynamics of the considered model .    </S>",
    "<S> the lovelock gravity @xcite have been intensively studied last several years ( see , for example  @xcite ) showing a revival of interest to this theory after about a decade of rather slow progress ( for achievements of 80-th and early 90-th of the last century see , for example , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main feature of this extension of the general relativity is that the resulting equations of motion are second order differential equations , in contrast to 4-th order equations in other modified gravity theories . </S>",
    "<S> another important feature of lovelock gravity is finite number of terms in the lagrangian in contrast to string gravity , where there is an infinite row of additional terms . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in perturbative string gravity we can study effects arising from corrections to gr only at the level of small perturbations , otherwise it would be necessary to include all infinite set of terms into analysis . in lovelock gravity </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to study regimes with non - einstein terms being equally or more important than the einstein part of the action .    </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian of lovelock gravity in an @xmath1-dimensional space consists of all terms which are topological invariants in lower dimensional spaces . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , there are no corrections to einstein theory in ( @xmath2 ) dimensions : the second curvature invariant , gauss - bonnet term , appears in four dimensions and have a contribution to the equations of motion for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the third invariant , cubic in curvature , starts to contribute from ( @xmath4 ) dimensions etc . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we study a flat anisotropic ( @xmath5)-dimensional universe , so the lovelock lagrangian has only one additional term in the form of the gauss - bonnet combination .    in the multidimensional anisotropic cosmology </S>",
    "<S> the gb - term leads to two qualitatively new features . a new type of singularity with finite scale factors and energy density and diverging time derivatives appears @xcite , and recollaps of a flat universe becomes possible @xcite . in the recent paper </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was shown that in the dynamics of a ( @xmath6)-dimensional anisotropic universe these two regimes are in some sense typical , and in most cases they prevent the universe from reaching a low - energy regime from a standard big bang singularity . </S>",
    "<S> only special initial conditions with three equal hubble parameters allow smooth evolution from big bang singularity to a 4-dimensional kasner regime ( which is exact solution in einstein gravity ) , all other trajectories either describe recollapsing universe or meet the nonstandard singularity .    in the present paper we provide a similar analysis for a flat ( @xmath5)-dimensional universe in lovelock gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the former result is valid only for that particular number of space - time dimensions , and though in the ( @xmath5)-dimensional case there are no additional terms in lovelock lagrangian in comparison with the ( @xmath6)-dimensional one , the smooth evolution from high - energy to low - energy regimes in ( @xmath5)-dimensional universe is typical and does not require severe fine - tuning of the initial conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a flat anisotropic universe with the metrics @xmath7 and the action @xmath8 where the gauss - bonnet term @xmath9 introducing five hubble parameters in a standard way , it is possible to write down equations of motion in the form of first integral    @xmath10 = 0 ,   \\end{array }   \\label{1}\\ ] ]    and five dynamical equations . </S>",
    "<S> the first equation of motion has the form    @xmath11 = 0 . </S>",
    "<S> \\end{array }   \\label{2}\\ ] ]    four other equations can be obtained by cyclic transmutation of indices @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> two obvious limiting cases can be identified easily . </S>",
    "<S> first , in the low - curvature regime , when the contribution from the gauss - bonnet term is small , we have well - known generalized kasner solution . in this solution scale factors have power - law dependence on time with the power indexes @xmath12 , and , correspondingly , @xmath13 with the kasner conditions @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    on the other hand , when einstein part of equations of motion are negligible in comparison with the gauss - bonnet contribution , another form of power - law solution exists @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are two form of this solution , both require @xmath16 , and either @xmath17 or @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter case contains solutions with @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are arbitrary numbers . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to discussion in @xcite we can show now that this form is the only possible solution of the second class up to transmutation of power indices .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , expressing @xmath22 from @xmath23 , then substituting it into @xmath24 and expressing @xmath25 we get    @xmath26    we want to show that the expression under the radical is non - positive . to show this consider the case when this expression crosses zero :    @xmath27    it would happen when    @xmath28    one can easily verify that radical expression in  ( [ roots2 ] ) is negative for any nonzero @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the expression under radical in ( 3 ) has the same sign for any combination of non - zero @xmath12 , an easy check shows that this sign is negative , ruling out all these combinations . if one of @xmath12 is zero , the condition @xmath16 requires that at least one of remaining indexes is also equal to zero , and in this case the condition @xmath18 further requires that the third index also vanishes . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the only possible form of the studied class is the combination @xmath31 found in @xcite .    , in ( b)the expansion rate @xmath32 , in ( c)individual kasner exponents @xmath33,in ( d )  </S>",
    "<S> the sum @xmath34 , and in ( e )  the sum @xmath35.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    this means that this class of solutions is a rather special one , and it is not surprising that we do not see it in our numerical simulations . from now on we consider only first class of power - law solution as a solution with standard cosmological singularity in a high - energy regime .    apart from high - curvature and low - curvature asymptotic power - law regimes the system ( 12 ) describes complicated behavior in the range of hubble parameters where both gauss - bonnet and einstein contributions are important . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied this system numerically , starting from initial conditions distributed randomly in the interval [ 0,1 ] for three hubble parameters , in the interval [ -1,1 ] for one of them and calculating fifth hubble parameter from the constraint equation  ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the integration stopped when one of the following regimes are reached :    * for expanding universe : low - curvature kasner regime , nonstandard singularity or recollaps . * for contracting universe : high - curvature power - law regime ( `` standard singularity '' ) or nonstandard singularity .    </S>",
    "<S> matching two branches , expanding and contracting , of numerical solution allows us to construct a full history of the modeled universe evolving from one of listed states to another .    the main feature which distinguishes the ( 5 + 1 ) case from the ( 4 + 1 ) </S>",
    "<S> one is that now the transition from a standard singularity to low - curvature kasner regime does not require severe fine - tuning ( we remind a reader that in the former case only trajectories with three scale factors equal to each other can show this type of transition ) .    in fig .  1 we presented a typical behavior of the model with `` standard singularity '' @xmath36 kasner smooth transition . </S>",
    "<S> in ( a ) panel we show @xmath37 evolution curves , in ( b ) panel@xmath32 ; individual kasner exponents @xmath12 are shown in ( c ) and their sum @xmath34 in ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily see that this is a high - energy power - law ( @xmath38 ) to low - energy kasner ( @xmath39 ) transition indeed . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that about 60@xmath0 of all the trajectories belong to this class . </S>",
    "<S> studying examples of this kind of dynamics for various initial conditions we also noticed that final values of power indexes are not distributed in homogeneous way on the kasner sphere , but prefer the situation clearly seen in the fig.1(c ) with one negative index and four positive and close to each other . inserting @xmath40 into the kasner conditions </S>",
    "<S> one can found that @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this estimation meets the results of our numerical analysis fairy well , which can be seen from fig.1(e ) where the combination @xmath42 is plotted . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for @xmath12 to be approximately equal in the low - energy stage remains a mystery and may indicates that some hidden symmetries we are ignorant about are involved , so the problem requires more detailed investigation .     </S>",
    "<S> and in ( b)the denominator of @xmath43.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    one of `` non - smooth '' solutions indicated above is the case of nonstandard singularity . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case when sometime during the evolution @xmath43 diverges while @xmath44 remain finite . solving eqs.(2 ) with respect to @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> we can express them in the form of fraction , and the nonstandard singularity occurs when the denominator crosses zero while numerator is regular and non - zero . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 the behavior of our model is shown for this case . in panel ( a ) we present the hubble functions @xmath37 , in panel ( b )  the behavior of the denominator of the fractional expression for @xmath43 . at @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> the denominator crosses zero , numerator and hubble parameters remain regular and non - zero . as this singularity is weak according to the tipler terminology @xcite , our numerical program typically goes through it , and the numerical results after the singularity are not physically valid : despite @xmath37 are regular , @xmath46 are singular , and , hence , scalar curvature invariants diverge , which makes the non - standard singularity physical , but not a coordinate one . </S>",
    "<S> so , the evolution presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) is only valid till the point @xmath45 where the non - standard singularity occurs . </S>",
    "<S> depending on initial conditions , the nonstandard singularity can be found either in future or past history of the particular universe . </S>",
    "<S> these trajectories take up to 15@xmath0 of all the trajectories .    </S>",
    "<S> , in ( b) the expansion rate @xmath32 , in ( c)the kasner exponents @xmath33 ; @xmath46 in ( d ) and their denominator in ( e).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    finally , the last case is the recollaps . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , starting from expansion ( the initial conditions in this case are chosen in a way to ensure @xmath47 from the beginning ) , the universe begins to contract at some point and ends up in a singularity . in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 we presented a typical behavior of the model which experience recollaps . in the panel </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) we showed individual @xmath37 , their sum in ( b ) , individual @xmath33 in ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> they diverge at some points due to the definition of @xmath12 : @xmath48 . in the panel ( d ) </S>",
    "<S> we presented @xmath46 and one can verify zeros of @xmath46 correspond to `` singularities '' of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> also in panel ( e ) of the fig .  3 we presented the denominator of the @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> , so the reader can verify that singularities in @xmath12 have nothing to do with the nonstandard singularity described above . </S>",
    "<S> last thing to mention , this case occupy remaining 25@xmath0 of all the trajectories .    </S>",
    "<S> we have considered dynamics of a flat anisotropic vacuum ( @xmath5)-dimensional universe in gauss - bonnet gravity . unlike the ( @xmath6)-dimensional case studied earlier  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we have found that nonstandard singularity and possible recollaps which usually prevented five - dimensional universe from reaching a low - curvature regime do not dominate in six dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> about 60% of trajectories in the latter case show smooth transition from gb dominated epoch to a low - curvature six - dimensional kasner regime . </S>",
    "<S> the other possibilities are a `` non - standard '' singularity ( about 15% ) and a recollaps ( about 25% ) . </S>",
    "<S> as we have used random set of initial conditions , other realizations can show slightly different numbers . </S>",
    "<S> however , our main result has a qualitative character and could not change significantly  a transition from big bang to low - curvature asymptotic is rather general in ( @xmath5 ) dimensions in contrast to the ( @xmath6)-dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate that lovelock cosmology in the world with odd number of space dimensions is much less pathological than in even - dimensional worlds .    </S>",
    "<S> some dynamical features of the model still require additional investigation . </S>",
    "<S> another possible direction of future work is to include a matter into analysis , which can modify the results for both ( @xmath6)- and ( @xmath5)-dimensional cases . </S>"
