    "electromagnetic form factors ( ffs ) of the nucleon are the standard source of information on the nucleon structure and as such have been studied extensively ; for recent reviews see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "the most recent generation of electron accelerators , which combine high current with high polarization electron beams , at mit - bates , the mainz microtron ( mami ) , and the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) of the jefferson lab ( jlab ) , have made it possible to investigate the internal structure of the nucleon with unprecedented precision .",
    "in particular , the new generation of polarization experiments that make use of the target- and recoil - polarization techniques have allowed to chart the proton and neutron electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "ffs very precisely .",
    "the status of proton electric ( @xmath1 ) and magnetic ( @xmath2 ) ff measurements is shown in fig .  [ fig : formf_p ] ( for more details and references , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the proton magnetic ff has been measured up to a momentum transfer @xmath3 of around 30  gev@xmath4 .",
    "the deviation of the proton magnetic ff from the standard dipole form @xmath5 has been measured precisely , showing a dip structure at low momentum transfers ( around @xmath6  gev@xmath4 ) and a scaling behavior at very large values of @xmath3 .",
    "the recent and unexpected results from jlab of using the polarization transfer technique to measure the proton electric over magnetic ff ratio , @xmath7  @xcite , has been the revelation that the ffs obtained using the polarization and rosenbluth cross section separation methods , were incompatible with each other , starting around @xmath8  gev@xmath4 ( see right panel on fig .  [",
    "fig : formf_p ] ) .",
    "the ffs obtained from cross section data had suggested that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the proton magnetic moment ; the results obtained from recoil polarization data clearly show that the ratio @xmath11 decreases linearly with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "the recoil polarization measurement for this ratio has been performed up to @xmath12  gev@xmath4 , and a new jlab experiment is extending this measurement ( at the time of writing ) up to @xmath13  gev@xmath4 . the numerous attempts to explain the difference between both experimental techniques in terms of radiative corrections which affect the results of the rosenbluth separation method very significantly , but",
    "polarization results only minimally , have led to the previously neglected calculation of two hard photon exchange with both photons sharing the momentum transfer , as discussed below .",
    "the use of the polarization technique has also resulted in a constant progress in the measurement of @xmath14 , which is intrinsically more difficult to obtain because of the smallness of this ff , due to the overall zero charge of the neutron .",
    "recent times have seen the maximum @xmath3 for which we have polarization ffs grow to 1.5 gev@xmath4 , with new data obtained and under analysis up to 3.4 gev@xmath4 , and several experiments planned or proposed to significantly higher @xmath3 values .",
    "important progress has been made for @xmath15 too , with new data with much improved error bars up to 4.8 gev@xmath4 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : formf_n ] .              when comparing the precision data for the nucleon e.m .",
    "ffs in figs .",
    "[ fig : formf_p ] and [ fig : formf_n ] , friedrich and walcher  @xcite made the striking observation that all four ffs display `` bump structures '' around @xmath6  gev@xmath4 .",
    "they interpret this structure as a signature of the pion cloud . for a comparison with new data of the blast coll . at low @xmath3 for both proton and neutron ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "given the large amount of precise data on ffs it is of interest to exhibit directly the spatial information which results from these data .",
    "when viewing the nucleon from a light front moving towards the nucleon , a model independent 2-dimensional mapping of the quark charge density in the nucleon can be achieved in the transverse plane ( perpendicular to the direction of motion ) . using only the empirical information on the nucleon e.m .",
    "ffs , these transverse charge densities have been extracted recently for an unpolarized nucleon  @xcite , as well as for a a transversely polarized nucleon  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : densities ] these transverse charge densities are shown for proton and neutron , both for the unpolarized case and for a nucleon polarized along the @xmath16-axis ( denoting the direction of the fast moving frame by the @xmath17-axis ) .",
    "one notices from fig .",
    "[ fig : densities ] that polarizing the proton along the @xmath16-axis leads to an induced electric dipole field which corresponds with an electric dipole moment along the negative @xmath18-axis equal to the value of the anomalous magnetic moment , _ i.e. _ @xmath19 ( in units @xmath20 ) as noticed in  @xcite .",
    "one sees that the corresponding neutron s transverse charge density gets displaced significantly due to the large ( negative ) value of the neutron anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath21 , which yields an induced electric dipole moment along the positive @xmath18-axis .    to calculate nucleon e.m .",
    "ffs from first principles , lattice qcd simulations have seen an important progress in recent years .",
    "state - of - the - art lattice calculations for nucleon structure studies use lattice spacings @xmath22  fm and lattice sizes @xmath23  fm and reach pion mass values down to about 350  mev . to connect those results with the physical world",
    "requires an extrapolation down to the physical quark mass @xmath24 ( with @xmath24 proportional to @xmath25 ) .",
    "it is only very recently that pion mass values below @xmath26  mev  @xcite have been reached .",
    "this continuous effort is important to eliminate one source of systematic error associated with the extrapolation to the light quark masses .",
    "the lattice calculations for the ( space - like ) nucleon e.m .",
    "ffs require the evaluation of three - point functions , which involve two topologically different contributions . in the connected diagram contribution , the photon couples to one of the quarks connected to either the initial or final nucleon",
    ". the disconnected diagram , which involves a coupling to a @xmath27 loop , requires a numerically more intensive calculation , is at present neglected in most lattice studies . when taking the difference between proton and neutron e.m .",
    "ffs , i.e. for the isovector combination , the disconnected contribution drops out .",
    "therefore , the calculations in which the disconnected diagram is neglected are applicable only to the isovector e.m",
    ". ffs .    fig .",

    "ffs , performed for one lattice spacing of @xmath28  fm , and for pion mass values in the range @xmath29  mev .",
    "it is seen that this action yields a noticeable dependence on @xmath30 for the dirac isovector ff @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath31 at the smallest @xmath30 value of around 360  mev is found to be in qualitative agreement with the data .",
    "evidently , it will be very worthwhile to corroborate the results at the lowest pion masses and improve their statistics in future calculations . for lattice calculations of the isovector ffs using wilson fermions , from the qcdsf coll .",
    ", see  @xcite ; and for calculations using dynamical domain wall fermions , from the rbc and ukqcd coll . , see @xcite .",
    "= 6.25 cm    present lattice calculations are possible for larger than physical quark masses , and therefore necessitate an extrapolation procedure in order to make contact with experiment .",
    "the extrapolation in @xmath24 is not straightforward , because the non - analytic dependencies , such as @xmath32 and @xmath33 , become important as one approaches the small physical value of @xmath24 . as an example ,",
    "the dirac charge radius , @xmath34 varies as @xmath35 when approaching the chiral limit . to extend the range of validity in @xmath30 of such a prediction ,",
    "a one may try in this spirit a modification of the chiral perturbation theory formula as  @xcite  : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a phenomenological cut - off which reflects the finite size of the nucleon , with @xmath38 a low - energy constant .",
    "the other parameters in this expression are fixed and well known .",
    "such a fit ( using @xmath39  mev ) for the isovector dirac radius is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1f2_lhpc ] and compared with the most recent unquenched lattice results using the hybrid action ( domain wall valence quarks on top of a 2 + 1 flavor staggered sea ) of the lhpc coll .",
    "one firstly sees , that these lattice results do show appreciable @xmath25 variation over the pion mass range @xmath29  mev and provide a first clear hint of the logarithmic @xmath30 divergence . as the pion mass approaches the physical value , the calculated nucleon size increases and approaches the correct value .    at larger momentum transfers ,",
    "the striking difference between the unpolarized ( rosenbluth ) and polarization transfer measurements of the proton @xmath40 ff ratio has triggered a renewed interest in the field of two - photon exchange in @xmath41 scattering experiments .",
    "theoretical calculations both within a hadronic and partonic framework made it very likely that hard two - photon exchange corrections are the main culprit in the difference between both experimental techniques  @xcite . despite the long history of two - photon exchange corrections ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review , it is interesting to note that concepts developed over the past decade , such as generalized parton distributions which describe two - photon processes with one or two large photon virtualities , enter when quantifying two - photon exchange corrections at larger @xmath3 .",
    "the model - independent finding is that the hard two - photon corrections hardly affect polarization transfer results , but they do correct the slope of the rosenbluth plots at larger @xmath3 in an important way , towards reconciling both experimental techniques .",
    "as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ newcomparison ] ( left panel ) the @xmath42-@xmath43 exchange correction on the extracted @xmath40 vs. @xmath3 within a partonic framework  @xcite .",
    "one set of data points , falling linearly with @xmath3 , is from the polarization experiments .",
    "another set of data points , roughly constant in @xmath3 and plotted with inverted triangles , is from rosenbluth data analyzed using only radiative corrections .",
    "the solid squares show the best fit @xmath44 from  @xcite data when analyzed including the hard @xmath42-@xmath43 corrections .",
    "one sees that for @xmath3 in the 23 gev@xmath4 range , the @xmath11 extracted using the rosenbluth method including the @xmath42-@xmath43 corrections agree well with the polarization transfer results . at higher @xmath3",
    ", there is at least partial reconciliation between the two methods .",
    "the effect , in a calculation with just a proton intermediate state , see e.g.  @xcite , is qualitatively similar and shown on the right panel in fig .",
    "[ newcomparison ] .",
    "several forthcoming high - precision electron scattering experiments aim at a precision test of these two - photon exchange effects .",
    "the nucleon e.m . ffs discussed above access the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon by measuring the matrix element of a well - defined quark - gluon operator ( in this case the vector operator @xmath45 ) over the hadronic state .",
    "one is however not limited in nature to probes such as photons ( or @xmath46 , @xmath47 bosons for the axial transition ) .",
    "the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom of qcd , meaning that at short distances the interactions between quarks and gluons become weak , provides us with more sophisticated qcd operators to explore the structure of hadrons .",
    "such operators can be accessed by selecting a small size configuration of quarks and gluons , provided by a hard reaction , such as deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , or hard exclusive reactions such as deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , @xmath48 , where the virtual photon momentum @xmath49 is the hard scale , see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gpd ] .",
    "the common important feature of such hard reactions is the possibility to separate clearly the perturbative and nonperturbative stages of the interactions  : this is the so - called factorization property .",
    "the non - perturbative stage of such hard exclusive electroproduction processes is described by universal objects , so - called generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , see  @xcite for reviews and references .",
    "= 4.5 cm    the nucleon structure information entering the nucleon dvcs process , can be parameterized at leading twist-2 level , in terms of four ( quark chirality conserving ) gpds , depending on three variables : the quark longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath50 of intial quark , @xmath51 of final quark , and the momentum transfer @xmath52 to the nucleon .",
    "the interplay between the @xmath16 and @xmath3-dependence of the gpds contains new nucleon structure information beyond the information encoded in forward parton distributions depending only on @xmath16 , or ffs depending only on @xmath3 .",
    "a fourier transform of the @xmath3-dependence of gpds accesses the distributions of parton in the transverse plane  @xcite . for the vector gpd @xmath53 at @xmath54 , this fourier integral in transverse momentum @xmath55 reads as : @xmath56 and an analogous definition for the other gpds .",
    "these impact parameter gpds have the physical meaning of measuring the probability to find a quark which carries longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath16 at a transverse position @xmath57 ( relative to the transverse center - of - momentum ) in a nucleon , see  @xcite . the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gpd ] shows the gpd @xmath58 , for an @xmath59-quark , within a 3-parameter modified regge gpd parameterization  @xcite .    besides providing a tomographic view of the nucleon , gpds",

    "the understanding of the nucleon excitation spectrum is tightly linked to its structure .",
    "the first baryon excited state , the @xmath0 resonance has been charted in particular detail in recent years , see @xcite for a recent review and references . at low @xmath3 ,",
