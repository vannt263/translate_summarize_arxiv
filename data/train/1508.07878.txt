    "the electron density is found by balancing the ionization rate against adsorption , and subsequent recombination , of electrons on grain surfaces .",
    "assuming monodisperse grains with radius @xmath20 , internal density @xmath21 , and dust - to - gas mass ratio @xmath22 , the equation describing this balance is @xmath23 ( sano et al .",

    "we find @xmath26 ( assuming @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) . for a typical midplane gas density inside a few au , @xmath30 ( weidenschilling 1977 ) , @xmath31 , a value too low to be of significance to the mri .",
    "recognition of this fact led gammie ( 1996 ) to suggest that protoplanetary disks interiors , especially the parts within a few au of their stars , are `` dead zones '' where the mri can not act .",
    "jin ( 1996 ) and gammie ( 1996 ) were the first to recognize that very close to the central star , protoplanetary disks may be hot enough to sustain thermal ionizations , recoupling the magnetic field to the gas . specifically , they pointed out that collisional ionization of gas - phase potassium atoms at temperatures @xmath32 would generate free electrons and ions .",
    "the threshold temperature of 1000  k is based on calculating the abundances of @xmath33 ions and electrons using the saha equation : @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the statistical weights of the ( ground states ) of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 the boltzmann constant , @xmath40 planck s constant , @xmath41 the electron mass , and @xmath42 the first ionization potential energy of potassium .",
    "assuming @xmath43 and that the abundance of k relative to @xmath4 in a solar - composition gas is @xmath44 ( lodders 2003 ) , half of the k atoms are ionized when @xmath45 , for a density @xmath46 likely to occur near the midplane .",
    "more significantly for the mri , @xmath47 when @xmath48 , meaning substantial ionization would be expected if potassium were in the gas phase at this temperature . according to lodders ( 2003 ) , the 50% condensation temperature of potassium is 1006  k ( at @xmath49 , or @xmath50 ; the pressure dependence is weak ) .",
    "so it is fairer to say that above 1000  k the saha equation predicts significant thermal ionization of potassium , and for temperatures between about 850 and 1000  k , thermal ionization may or may not lead to significant ionization .",
    "other species contribute less strongly to thermal ionization than potassium . because of the exponential dependence on the first ionization potential ( @xmath51 )",
    ", one might expect other alkali atoms to contribute to thermal ionization .",

    ", one might expect cs to be the dominant contributor of ions and electrons at temperatures between 850 and 1000  k ; however , the cs is @xmath58 times less abundant , so that even if all cs were ionized and only 0.1% of all k atoms were in the gas phase , potassium would still dominate over cesium .",
    "thermal ionization of potassium is likely to be more important than that of other alkalis , and potassium is in any case an excellent proxy for other alkalis . throughout this paper",

    "( 2005 ) from analyses of carbonaceous chondrites ( `` meteoritic '' ) or from spectrometry of the sun ( `` photospheric '' ) . producing free electrons by thermal ionization requires the presence of elements with high abundance and low fip , i.e. , those elements toward the plot s lower right corner .",
    "the exponential sensitivity of the ionization fraction to fip means potassium ( k ) is most favored to provide free electrons by thermal ionization , with na , rb , and cs potentially also important  if these elements occur in the gas phase rather than locked up in minerals . ]",
    "[ fig : thermalionization ]    a criticism of this thermal ionization picture is that the saha equation is valid only in local thermodynamic equilibrium , or lte ( desch 1998 ) .",
    "it relies on the collisional ionization of the gas - phase k atoms , e.g. , @xmath59 , being in detailed balance with its inverse reaction , three - body gas - phase recombination , @xmath60 .",
    "but under conditions typical for protoplanetary disks , electrons are more likely to recombine with ions on the surfaces of grains .",
    "desch ( 1998 ) argued that the electron density must be set by balancing collisional ionizations against collisions of electrons with dust grains .",
    "once adsorbed on the grain surfaces , electrons and ions quantum tunnel from one adsorption site to the next , wandering across the surface until they find each other and recombine .",
    "the resulting neutral k atoms can then escape the grain .",
    "dust grain surface - catalyzed recombinations are much faster than gas - phase recombinations , as the frequency of colliding with dust grains is @xmath61 @xmath62 ( at @xmath63 k and @xmath64 , and assuming grains with radius @xmath65 and a dust - to - gas mass ratio 0.01 ) , whereas the frequency of recombining with an ion is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the recombination coefficient ( see below ) , and we have assumed the ion density matches the electron density , and @xmath68 .",
    "not until @xmath69 do gas - phase recombinations dominate over grain - catalyzed recombinations .",
    "the dominance of grain effects invalidates the use of the saha equation for potassium as a means of calculating the electron density .",
    "the dominance of grain processes also points to an additional ionization source , not previously considered in the context of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the process that is the inverse of electrons and ions colliding with grains , resulting in neutral atoms leaving the grain , is the emission of electrons or ions following collisions of neutral atoms with grains .",
    "these processes are more commonly called thermionic emission and ion emission .",
    "when solids are heated to temperatures @xmath70 , they emit electrons and/or ions .",
    "the emission of electrons depends on the work function of the solids comprising the grains , which also affects whether evaporating atoms such as potassium are emitted as neutral atoms or ions .",
    "including the thermionic and ion emission completely changes the role of dust grains in the ionization of the gas : instead of mopping up free charges , they generate them .    in this paper",
    "we examine the effects of thermionic and ion emission on the ionization state of high - temperature , dusty gas . in ",
    "2 we discuss the microphysical mechanisms of thermionic and ion emission , as well as the evaporation and condensation of k atoms , and provide quantitative rates and likely input parameters . in ",
    "3 we create a simple model treating evaporation and condensation of k atoms and ions , including ion emission and thermionic emission .",
    "we show that , because of the high work function of silicate grains , ion emission creates signficant ionization at temperatures around 800  k , possibly as low as 600  k. in  4 we discuss the impact on several aspects of protoplanetary disks . in particular ,",
    "we address where the dead zone s inner edge should lie , what temperatures are needed for disk gas to diffuse into the star s magnetosphere , and whether including this new ionization source can enable the `` short - circuit instability '' of mcnally et al .",
    "thermionic and ion emission profoundly affect the ionization state of high - temperature gas in disks .",
    "in the dusty gas of protoplanetary disks , we can not always use the saha equation , and instead must check the rates of various ionization and recombination processes .",
    "what s more , protoplanetary disks are marked by transient temperature changes , and we are interested in how the ionization responds to the changing conditions .",
    "thus motivated , in this section we lay out several processes kinetic rates and construct a chemical network to find the steady - state abundances of electrons and ions as well as the timescales for the ionization chemistry to reach equilibrium .",
    "our chemical network includes five species : electrons , molecular or atomic ions , k atoms bound to dust grains , gas - phase neutral k atoms , and gas - phase k ions .",
    "energetic particles ( cosmic rays , radioactive decay products , etc . ) , and at high temperatures also gas - phase reactions , ionize the gas molecules ; ions and electrons recombine in the gas phase .",
    "we also include dust grains , calculating their steady - state charge .",
    "all the other species can collide with and condense on or chemically react with the grains .",
    "the grains can lose k atoms at high temperatures , and can eject electrons and ions by the thermionic effect and by ion emission , respectively . before discussing the chemical network ,",
    "we review these chemical processes .",
    "as discussed above , the @xmath4 molecules ionization can come from energetic particles such as galactic cosmic rays , x - ray photons , or particles from radioactive decays .",
    "the number of ionizations per volume per time is defined as @xmath71 .",
    "we are most interested in protoplanetary disks interiors , so we assume that the cosmic rays and x - rays are shielded , leaving only ionization by the decay of radioactive elements . if short - lived radionuclides are not present , then decay of @xmath16 , as well as @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , dominate , yielding @xmath75 ( umebayashi & nakano 1981 ) . if the short - lived ( @xmath76 ) radionuclide @xmath18 is present at levels inferred from meteorites ( macpherson et al .",
    "1995 ) , then @xmath77 ( umebayashi & nakano 2009 ) .",
    "our focus here is on high - temperature ionization , so we arbitrarily take @xmath78 in what follows .",
    "( if ionizations by @xmath18 are significant , the ion and electron densities would rise sharply above 800 k instead of 700 k. ) the @xmath79 ions quickly exchange charge with other molecules to produce ions such as @xmath80 , which then also exchange charge with free atoms , creating ions such as @xmath81 .",
    "we assume these steps are faster than the other reactions , so each ionization of @xmath4 quickly yields an atomic ion .",
    "we do not consider @xmath82 as one of these ions , because other species like mg are more abundant .",
    "instead we assume @xmath82 ions are produced mainly by thermal ionization .    atomic ions and free electrons",
    "can recombine in the gas phase .",
    "we assume a rate per volume @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , @xmath85 measured in k ( oppenheimer & dalgarno 1974 ) .",
    "ions and free electrons can also be adsorbed onto grain surfaces , at rates @xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 reflect modifications to the collision cross section due to the grain charge ( draine & sutin 1987 ) .",
    "thermal ionization of alkali atoms occurs if they are in the gas phase and suffer collisions with ambient molecules , mostly @xmath4 .",
    "this process can be represented by the reaction @xmath90 in the gas phase , electrons and ions can radiatively recombine , as follows , @xmath91 but in the regions of protoplanetary disks where temperatures are @xmath70 ( the midplane regions well inside 1  au ) , the gas densities are likely high enough that three - body recombinations dominate : @xmath92 we justify this statement below .",
    "literature on the collisional ionization and recombination rates is sparse .",
    "pneumann & mitchell ( 1965 ) present a kinetic rate , but cite no measurements or sources .",
    "their rate also appears to conflict with that provided by ashton & hayhurst ( 1973 ) .",
    "since the latter is experimentally determined by analyzing the chemical reactions in flames , it is our preferred value . following ashton & hayhurst ( 1973 ) , collisional ionization takes place at a rate per unit volume @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath85 is measured in k. here @xmath95 for k , and @xmath96 .",
    "the 3-body gas - phase recombination rate is @xmath97 where @xmath98 and again @xmath85 is measured in kelvin ( ashton & hayhurst 1973 ) .",
    "the two coefficients @xmath99 and @xmath67 must be related to each other . in the absence of dust",
    ", these would be the only rates affecting the ionization fraction , and should be in detailed balance with each other in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the ionization fractions found using these coefficients thus should conform to the saha equation .",
    "hence , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , and therefore we expect @xmath102 the values from ashton & hayhurst ( 1973 ) yield @xmath103 consistent with the saha equation",
    ".    recombinations by 3-body reactions proceed at a rate @xmath104 , which is to be compared to the rate of radiative 2-body recombinations , @xmath105 . for typical radiative recombinations , @xmath106 ( oppenheimer & dalgarno 1974 ) . at @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and if @xmath57 , then @xmath109 . for densities @xmath110 ,",
    "radiative recombinations of @xmath82 and electrons are less significant than 3-body recombinations , but we include both rates in our calculations .",
    "thermionic emission , the ejection of electrons from heated solids , is a long recognized effect and the basis for the cathode ray tube .",
    "the rate at which electrons are emitted , per surface area of solid , is described by richardson s law , @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a dimensionless number of order unity depending on the solid material , and is typically @xmath113 ( crowell et al .",
    "1965 ) .",
    "thermionic emission is sensitive to @xmath114 , the work function of the material  that is , the energy needed to make an electron escape the solid . as the grains lose electrons and develop a positive charge @xmath115 , removing more electrons requires extra work to overcome the coulomb force .",
    "the effective work function is @xmath116 for conductors , the escape takes place from the top of the conduction band , and the work function is easily measured and commonly tabulated .",

    "the treatment of high - temperature ionization in protoplanetary disks also can be applied to the `` short - circuit '' instability of current sheets . in protoplanetary disks with magnetorotational turbulence , it is reasonable to assume ( and simulations show ) that a commonly occurring magnetic geometry has one region of more - or - less uniform magnetic field adjacent to another region with the field lines oriented in the opposite direction ( sano et al .",
    "2007 ; hubbard et al .",
    "the surface separating the two is marked by steep magnetic gradients and high current densities , and is termed the current sheet .",
    "ohmic dissipation can lead to heating in this sheet .",
    "hubbard et al .",
    "( 2012 ) argued that if the gas magnetic diffusivity @xmath300 decreases with increasing temperature then the heating can grow exponentially : increased temperature leads to lower diffusivity ; the current concentrates in the lower - diffusivity layer , accompanied by more ohmic heating ; so the temperature increases further .",
    "the runaway heating can be quite rapid , potentially taking hours or less , depending on the ionization properties of the gas .",
    "hubbard et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and mcnally et al .",

    "2006 ) . whether current sheet instabilities can take place in protoplanetary disks , and whether they can grow fast enough to be the chondrule formation mechanism , are key questions that hinge on the ionization state of the gas at high temperatures .",
    "the growth rate of the short - circuit instability was calculated by hubbard et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who performed a linear analysis on a background state in which the magnetic field increases linearly from @xmath340 to @xmath341 as @xmath342 runs from @xmath343 to + @xmath344 , where @xmath342 is the direction normal to the current sheet .",
    "they assumed that perturbations in the magnetic field , current density , etc .",
    ", vary as @xmath345 , where @xmath39 is the wavenumber of the perturbation and @xmath346 is the growth rate . the growth rate",
    "is then found to satisfy the equation @xmath347 where @xmath348 is the timescale over which emission of radiation cools the region ; we specify its value below . here",
    "@xmath349 is the timescale for the magnetic field to diffuse one wavelength , and @xmath350 is the magnetic diffusivity in the background state .",
    "other zero subscripts likewise indicate conditions in the background state .",
    "the timescale @xmath351 can be defined as @xmath352 where @xmath353 is the timescale for ohmic dissipation to heat the gas significantly .",
    "we have written @xmath354 in terms of the plasma beta parameter in the zero - order state , @xmath355 , which makes clear that the heating rate is directly tied to the rate at which magnetic field lines diffuse into the current sheet . in the usual case where @xmath356 decreases with increasing temperature , @xmath357 . in that case ,",
    "unstable growth is assured if @xmath358 .    to determine @xmath348 we imagine a slab of thickness @xmath359 , heated to temperature @xmath85 by ohmic dissipation .",
    "the slab will cool as it emits radiation that must diffuse through the surrounding gas .",
    "if this gas has density @xmath360 , heat capacity @xmath361 , and opacity ( per mass of gas ) @xmath362 , the appropriate timescale is the radiative diffusion time , @xmath363 ( mihalas & mihalas 1984 ; kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ; desch & connolly 2002 ) .",
    "so that the scenario is relevant to chondrule formation , we adopt @xmath364 , @xmath365 , and @xmath366 . as for the opacity , a reasonable value",
    "would be @xmath367 if dust were present ( at @xmath365 ) , but since micron - sized dust generally vaporizes within minutes in the chondrule - forming region , a more reasonable opacity would be that of chondrules alone , @xmath368 ( morris & desch 2010 ) .",
    "we find @xmath369 if @xmath370 , and @xmath371 if @xmath372 .",
    "note that mcnally et al .",
    "( 2013 ) took densities @xmath373 , which would make cooling slower by 4  orders of magnitude ; but even in a disk with 10  times more material than the minimum mass solar nebula ( weidenschilling 1977 ) , these densities are only achieved far inside 1  au , so some outward transport process would be needed to place the chondrules in the asteroid belt . at the lower densities that seem more likely to prevail",
    ", the current sheet cools by radiative diffusion in a @xmath348 of seconds to hours .    with the cooling timescale in hand , it is simple to find the ratio of @xmath351 and @xmath348 : @xmath374 note that the ratio does not depend on the size of the slab : the heating timescale relies on diffusion of magnetic flux , and the cooling timescale relies on diffusion of radiation , so both scale as @xmath375 .",
    "unstable modes require this ratio to be @xmath376 , or @xmath377 for reasonable parameters ( @xmath378 , @xmath365 , @xmath379 , @xmath380 ) , and assuming @xmath381 and @xmath370 , @xmath382 .",
    "( or @xmath383 times higher if dust evaporates )",
    ". the resistivity must be high enough that the current sheet can be continually fed with magnetic field lines by diffusion , faster than radiation can cool the gas .",
    "we can also express this requirement as a _ maximum _",
    "electron fraction @xmath281 , using the following relationship : @xmath384 ( hayashi 1981 ; balbus & terquem 2001 ) .",
    "we find the unstable modes require @xmath385 , or three orders of magnitude smaller if dust evaporates .    for our canonical case depicted in figure  2 , if @xmath386 there is no variation in the electron density with temperature , in which case @xmath387 , and no unstable modes can be expected .",
    "for @xmath388 , @xmath389 ( the electron density rises 8 orders of magnitude as @xmath85 increases from 750  k to 900  k ) , so @xmath390 ( or three orders of magnitude smaller if dust evaporates ) .",
    "this means the instability can proceed until @xmath391 . for hotter temperatures the electron density is too high for field lines to diffuse into the current sheet fast enough to overcome the radiative cooling",
    "so , for the short - circuit instability to act , the ambient temperature of gas surrounding the current sheet must fall in the narrow range @xmath392 .",
    "the case with grains with work function @xmath393 is similar to the canonical case . for the @xmath394 case , @xmath395 for @xmath85 between 600 and 800  k.",
    "we then find @xmath396 or so . a wider range of temperatures , extending down to 650 k , is then allowed to be unstable .",
    "again , if dust evaporates in the chondrule formation region , then the faster radiative cooling means the maximum allowable electron density is much lower , by about three orders of magnitude .",
    "a second requirement for the current sheet instability is that a current sheet can be set up in the first place .",
    "this in turn requires the existence of magnetic turbulence in the disk , almost certainly from the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "the mri is suppressed if the ohmic elsasser number @xmath397 is less than unity , or if @xmath398 , where @xmath399 is the alfven number and @xmath299 the keplerian orbital frequency ( jin 1996 ) . from the definition of the plasma beta number , @xmath400 , where @xmath401 is the sound speed ; in disks in which the mri has saturated , typically @xmath402 ( miller & stone 2000 ; hirose et al .",
    "therefore the existence of the mri requires @xmath403 .",
    "note that the existence of a current sheet demands a _ low _ value of the magnetic diffusivity , while the short - circuit instability requires a _ high _ value of @xmath356 . for reasonable parameters ( say , @xmath404 , at 1 au in the disk )",
    ", the mri requires @xmath405 , or @xmath406 . for our canonical case",
    ", there is an exceedingly narrow range of electron fractions in the ambient nebula that can both lead to current sheets and the short - circuit instability : @xmath407 , corresponding to a very narrow temperature range about 10 k wide , centered on about 900 k. as the work function of solids is reduced , the range narrows . for the @xmath408 case",
    ", there is in fact no overlap : the electron fractions needed for runaway growth are not compatible with the operation of the mri and the existence of current sheets .",
    "if dust evaporates in the chondrule formation region , there is no overlap in conditions for any value of @xmath114 .",
    "the net effect of all these factors is that the gas ionization needed to generate magnetic turbulence and to initiate the short - circuit instability are unlikely to be simultaneously met in protoplanetary disks .",
    "finally , we point out one additional problem for the short - circuit instability , which is its need to grow faster than the chemical timescales will allow .",
    "the timescales in the problem must be @xmath409 , which we argue is no more than 5000  s ( for @xmath410 and no evaporation of dust ) .",
    "the instability requires the gas resistivity to decrease as the temperature increases , on these timescales .",
    "the steady - state electron abundance indeed increases with temperature , but the ionization chemistry takes time to reach steady state . according to figures  2 and 5 , the electron abundance starts to rise with temperature above 750  k or so , but the chemical timescales to achieve these higher electron abundances also rise . above about 800",
    "k , the chemical timescales exceed 5000  s and approach @xmath411 s. this effectively reduces @xmath412 , potentially by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude , making the instability more difficult to initiate and grow .    in summary ,",
    "the short - circuit instability requires a rise in electron abundance with temperature , together with an initially large magnetic diffusivity so that magnetic heating is faster than radiative cooling .",
    "however , generating current sheets in the first place requires a small magnetic diffusivity . depending on such parameters as gas density , opacity , grain work function , etc .",
    ", there is either no way to simultaneously satisfy these requirements , or they are satisfied only in a narrow ( perhaps 10  k ) temperature range , typically above 700  k. the short - circuit instability therefore appears to require rather special conditions .",
    "moreover , the requirement that the temperature start above 700  k is inconsistent with the presence of primary sulfur in chondrules , which indicates ambient temperatures @xmath413650  k ( lodders 2003 ) .",
    "even if short - circuit instabilities can arise from current sheets , they do not seem compatible with the chondrule formation mechanism .",
    "the ionization state of the gas hotter than about 500 k determines how well protostellar disks couple to their internal magnetic fields and to the fields of the central star .",
    "properly calculating the ionization state is especially important for assessing where the magnetorotational instability can operate , which bears on the question of how the disks evolve over time .",
    "it bears on whether disk gas can be loaded onto a star s magnetic field .",
    "it also bears on whether current sheets can dissipate magnetic energy via the current sheet instability .",
    "previous treatments of ionization at high temperatures have assumed that potassium atoms are in the gas phase and that they are ionized according to the saha equation .",
    "this approach ignores the role of dust and the fact that ions and electrons strike grains far more often than they meet one another in the gas and recombine .",
    "furthermore gas - phase collisions are not the only ionization process . at high temperatures ,",
    "the grains also emit electrons and ions into the gas .",
    "balancing thermionic ( and ion ) emission against adsorption of electrons ( and ions ) on the grains yields the saha - langmuir equation , which is similar in form to the saha equation , but instead of the first ionization potential of the gas - phase atoms ( e.g.  4.34  ev for potassium ) involves the work function of the grain material .",
    "work functions typical of the solid materials in protoplanetary disks are near 5  ev ( silicates at 5.0 to 5.4  ev , feni metal at 4.4  ev , graphite 4.62  ev ) .",
    "these exceed the first ionization potential of potassium , but because the grains present so much surface area , the disk gas is more ionized ( with higher electron density ) than expected based on the saha equation .",
    "these processes are important at temperatures between 700 k and the dust sublimation threshold .",
    "we are the first to identify their role in ionizing the gas in the central regions of protoplanetary disks .",
    "we have incorporated thermionic and ion emission into a chemical network and solved for the steady - state abundances of electrons and other species as functions of temperature and density . unlike previous analyses",
    ", we do not automatically assume that potassium atoms reside in the gas phase ; in fact , lodders ( 2003 ) predicts a 50% condensation temperature of 1006  k , meaning that below about 1000  k , most potassium is locked up in solids .",
    "we mimic this effect by using an evaporation energy @xmath414 that potassium atoms must acquire to leave the grain surface . thus above 800  k ,",
    "at least one in @xmath415 or @xmath411 potassium atoms is in the gas phase rather than locked up in the grains .",
    "this treatment is approximate , but even if all the sodium were firmly bound to the grains at lower temperatures , cesium atoms are in the gas phase above 850  k ( lodders 2003 ) and their abundance is only @xmath58 times less than potassium .",
    "some alkali atoms thus occur in the gas below 1000  k.    the most signficant result from our canonical case is a major rise in the electron fraction at temperatures between 700  k and 900  k. we find that qualitatively , the run of electron fraction with temperature is relatively insensitive to the work function ( figure  8) , gas density ( figure  16 ) , and dust - to - gas mass ratio ( figure  12 ) .",
    "quantitatively , the temperature at which the electron fraction rises sharply does vary somewhat : if the dust - to - gas mass ratio is increased ( decreased ) two orders of magnitude , the rise in electron density is shifted about 100  k to higher ( lower ) temperatures ( figure  12 ) , with similar results expected for changes in grain size . likewise , increasing ( decreasing )",
    "the gas density by two orders of mangitude causes the rise in electron density to occur at temperatures about 100  k higher ( lower ) ( figure  16 ) .",
    "a notable feature of the results is that the electron density can _ almost _ be computed using the saha equation for potassium , but one must use an ionization potential less than 4.34  ev . above 800  k , for plausible grain work functions , values between 3.5 and 4.0  ev yield the correct ionization state , and that state is significantly more ionized than at lower temperatures . as a robust result , then , thermal ionization can be said to be significant above about 800  k.    a notable feature of the high - temperature regime is that the grains become rather highly charged through directly emitting electrons ( or ions ) .",
    "the grain charge can be positive or negative , but for the most likely work function values near 5  ev , the grains emit ions and are left with negative charges .",
    "the charging is strong above 800  k , and grains of radius @xmath65 reach charges of about @xmath213 at 900  k ( figure  3 ) . while much larger than the grain charges found neglecting thermionic and ion emission , this is equivalent to an electric potential of just 1  volt .",
    "the charging is strong enough to affect the grains coagulation at high temperatures .",
    "the coulomb energies that must be overcome for grains to collide are @xmath416  ev , or @xmath417 , so micron - sized grains coming together slower than @xmath418 will be mutually repelled by the electrical force .",
    "the effects of grain charging on the coagulation of grains have been investigated by okuzumi ( 2009 ) .",
    "we also point out that if there were any grains composed of materials with work functions @xmath419  ev , then their positive charges would enhance their collision rates with the negatively charged grains .",
    "we have applied our charging model to the question of the mri dead zone s inner edge . at low temperatures",
    "the gas is insufficiently ionized to permit the coupling of the gas to the magnetic field that is fundamental to the mri .",
    "we find that for reasonable disk parameters ( gas density , magnetic field strength ) , the temperature needed for the mri to operate is set by ambipolar rather than ohmic diffusion .",
    "the typical threshold temperatures are in the range 900 to 1100  k. at the high densities found near the midplane , the thresholds are comparable to or up to 100 k less than when neglecting the thermionic and ion emission and considering only the ohmic resistivity . at the lower , atmospheric densities ,",
    "ambipolar diffusion makes the thresholds up to 300 k higher than those from the saha equation and ohmic resistivity .",
    "nevertheless , the results validate the common belief that thermal ionization requires temperatures above 1000  k. we likewise have investigated the temperatures required to diffusively load the disk mass onto the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "we find once again that temperatures below 1000  k are required , and that the threshold is set by ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the high - temperature ionization also has implications for the onset of the `` short - circuit instability '' and its role in chondrule formation .",
    "this instability relies on the resistivity of the gas decreasing with increasing temperature , so that dissipation of magnetic energy during reconnection events can accelerate .",
    "we confirm that above a critical threshold temperature ( about 800 k in our canonical case , but potentially as low as 650 k ) , this condition is met . on the other hand , the presence of primary sulfur ( rubin et al .",
    "1999 ) in chondrules suggests that they condensed in regions cooler than 650 k , the condensation temperature of sulfur .",
    "in addition , we show that there are two extra and seemingly incompatible constraints with which the short - circuit instability must comply .",
    "the instability requires the resistivity to change on timescales faster than the gas can cool .",
    "this in turn imposes a _ lower _ limit on the resistivity , and an upper limit on the electron fraction , so that field lines can diffuse rapidly enough into the reconnection region ; typically @xmath281 must not exceed about @xmath420 . the short - circuit instability also requires magnetic turbulence to set up the current sheets of oppositely oriented field lines . assuming magnetic turbulence is generated by the mri , this in turn imposes an _ upper _ limit on the resistivity , and a lower limit to the electron fraction ; typically @xmath281 must be @xmath420 or greater . for typical conditions , only a small range of electron fractions",
    "satisfy both conditions simultaneously , while for many parameters ( especially if dust evaporates in the chondrule - forming region ) , no conditions simultaneously lead to the formation of current sheets and allow the short - circuit instability .",
    "this and the constraint that chondrule precursors started at temperatures @xmath421 to retain primary sulfur would seem to imply that current sheets and the short - circuit instability are probably not the chondrule formation mechanism .    we note that thermionic and ion emission may be important to the ionization state of gas in the atmospheres of exoplanets , especially `` hot jupiters '' .",
    "ohmic dissipation of magnetic energy in their atmospheres has been invoked as the explanation for the inflated radii ( above model predictions ) of hot jupiters such as hd209458b and hd189733b ( batygin & stevenson 2010 ; perna et al .",
    "2010 ) and may affect atmospheric circulation ( menou 2012 ; rogers & komacek 2014 ) . at present , the resistivity of the gas in such models is computed essentially using equation  41 ( as in balbus & terquem 2001 ) , with the electron density found using the saha equation for various gas - phase atoms ( batygin & stevenson 2010 ; rogers & komacek 2014 ) .",
    "however , hot jupiters , hd209458b and hd189733b in particular , are predicted to have cloud layers containing condensates such as tio ( fortney et al .",
    "tio has a work function of about 4.5  ev ( fomenko 1966 ; greiner et al .",
    "2012 ) and a cosmochemical abundance equivalent to a dust - to - gas ratio @xmath422 ( lodders 2003 ) . at pressures of 1 bar , and temperatures of 1000 k",
    ", the gas density would be @xmath423 .",
    "we therefore expect that thermionic and ion emission from tio particles , and adsorption of electrons and ions onto them , will control the ionization state of the gas , which will then _ not _ be described using a saha equation , above some threshold temperature .",
    "comparing to figures  12 and 16 , we expect that the high density will raise the threshold temperature , while the low dust - to - gas ratio would lower the threshold temperature , but that thermionic emission would dominate the charging of the gas above about 800 to 1000 k. naively , we expect thermionic emission will lead to higher electron fractions and lower ohmic dissipation than use of the saha equation alone , but exoplanet atmospheres are far enough out of the regime considered in this paper that other details may play a role . in any case , we recommend that this charging mechanism be considered when calculating ohmic dissipation in the atmospheres of hot jupiters",
    ".    we also recommend that future effort be directed to measuring the work functions of astrophysically relevant materials , especially those found in protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "we culled information from a variety of decades - old sources , but a dedicated effort should be made to consistently compare thermionic and ion emission from silicates , feni , graphite particles , and other astrophysical solids .    where solids exist",
    ", they can catalyze the recombinations of electrons and ions on their surfaces , rendering the saha equation incorrect .",
    "but they also emit electrons or ions directly into the gas , at rates that depend on their material properties . in the end ,",
    "the ionization fraction increases faster with temperature than under the saha equation . for relevant conditions ,",
    "we find that the ionization rises significantly above 800  k.    we thank the organizers of the august 2014 meeting `` non - ideal magnetohydrodynamics , stability , and dissipation in protoplanetary disks '' at the niels bohr international academy in copenhagen , for providing a forum for our collaboration .",

    "<S> we calculate the abundances of electrons and ions in the hot ( @xmath0  k ) , dusty parts of protoplanetary disks , treating for the first time the effects of thermionic and ion emission from the dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> high - temperature ionization modeling has involved simply assuming that alkali elements such as potassium occur as gas - phase atoms and are collisionally ionized following the saha equation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the saha equation often does not hold , because free charges are produced by thermionic and ion emission and destroyed when they stick to grain surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> this means the ionization state depends not on the first ionization potential of the alkali atoms , but rather on the grains work functions . </S>",
    "<S> the charged species abundances typically rise abruptly above about 800  k , with little qualitative dependence on the work function , gas density , or dust - to - gas mass ratio . applying our results , we find that protoplanetary disks dead zone , where high diffusivities stifle magnetorotational turbulence , has its inner edge located where the temperature exceeds a threshold value @xmath1  k. the threshold is set by ambipolar diffusion except at the highest densities , where it is set by ohmic resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the disk gas can be diffusively loaded onto the stellar magnetosphere at temperatures below a similar threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate whether the `` short - circuit '' instability of current sheets can operate in disks and find that it can not , or works only in a narrow range of conditions ; it appears not to be the chondrule formation mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest that thermionic emission is important for determining the rate of ohmic heating in hot jupiters . </S>"
