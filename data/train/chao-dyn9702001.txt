    "coupled map lattices ( cml ) with an additive conserved quantity became a subject of intensive research recently @xcite . on the one hand such cml s are often obtained as phenomenological models representing the dynamics of a large number of interacting macroscopic structures . on the other hand",
    "they are a natural result of finite - difference approximations of continuous nonlinear partial differential equations such as the kuramoto - sivashinky equation @xcite , or a phenomenological cahn - hilliard equation @xcite describing the nonlinear dynamics of several systems with conserved - order - parameter .",
    "models of this class are expected to represent several typical non - equilibrium physical phenomena .",
    "for instance , surface waves @xcite , where the average depth of the fluid in the container is conserved , electrohydrodynamic instabilities in nematics with insulating plates @xcite , where the total charge is conserved , disturbances in the atmosphere and ocean systems , where the total ( depth integrated ) heat is conserved , and even some types of hard turbulence @xcite . as such they are significant as tools for studying the complex spatiotemporal behavior of spatially extended nonlinear systems , especially in the strongly chaotic regime , where the analytical methods designed for weak nonlinearities become ineffective .    for",
    "coupled map systems with an additive conserved quantity several major points are still awaiting clarification .",
    "first of all , what is the effect of the conservation law on the structure of the phase diagram and the character of the phase transitions ? what is the connection between the conservation law and singularities observed in the density of lyapunov exponents @xcite and what is the origin and significance of these singularities ?",
    "another important issue is to determine which parameters best describe the dynamics of an extended system and what their limitations are . in particular , it is unclear whether the lyapunov spectrum provides any exclusive information about the chaotic dynamics that can not be obtained by other methods . and",
    "finally , we would like to know whether the reduction of the system dynamics to symbolic form preserves the main characteristics of the chaotic dynamics and can provide us with the complete description of the latter .",
    "the model chosen should be relatively simple yet represent most of the typical features under consideration .",
    "most important , it should have nontrivial phase diagram . with this in mind",
    "we pick the 1-dimensional collection of @xmath1 diffusively coupled chaotic maps : @xmath2 with periodic boundary conditions imposed .",
    "the local map was chosen to be @xmath3    this cml can also be regarded as a finite difference approximation of the differential equation continuous in both space and time @xmath4 a differential equation of this form represents the competition between two opposing tendencies : generation of chaotic perturbations by the nonlinear part of @xmath5 and dissipation of these perturbations by the diffusive coupling introduced by the second spatial derivative .",
    "the model clearly possesses the conservation law : @xmath6 so that aside from the two parameters of the local map @xmath7 and @xmath8 we have an additional control parameter  the additive conserved quantity @xmath9 , which is defined by the initial condition and is of critical importance to the behavior of the system .",
    "we are primarily interested in the dynamics in the `` thermodynamic limit '' @xmath10 , although the numerics is obviously restricted to finite systems .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec_phase ]",
    "we study the phase diagram of the coupled map model . in section [ sec_symbol ]",
    "we introduce the symbolic ( reduced ) description of the system dynamics . in section [ sec_domain ]",
    "we discuss the quantitative description of the reduced dynamics . in section [ sec_transition ]",
    "we study phase transitions in our model and determine their types .",
    "in particular , we study the effect of the conservation law on the type of the transition and on the values of critical exponents . in section [ sec_lyapunov ]",
    "we discuss the applicability of the lyapunov dimension to the description of the dynamics in the system . in section [ sec_singular ]",
    "we present numerical data suggesting the reason for the existence of the singularity in the spectrum of lyapunov exponents . in section [ sec_conserv ]",
    "we demonstrate the effect of violations of the conservation law on the system dynamics .",
    "the paper ends with a summary and discussion in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "despite its simple form , this model has a very rich structure .",
    "numerical simulations show that depending on the values of the control parameters it can be strongly or mildly chaotic , show spatiotemporal intermittency ( sti ) , give rise to pattern formation or simply decay into the spatially uniform stable state , or ( for @xmath1  even ) a 2-cycle in both space and time .",
    "both asymptotically regular ( non - chaotic ) states can be described by a single equation : @xmath11    in order to gain some insight into the phase diagram we analytically determine the boundaries of the stability regions of the two non - chaotic asymptotic states of the system .",
    "linear stability analysis of the spatially uniform state gives lyapunov exponents ( equivalent to the growth rates ) in the form : @xmath12 from this one can conclude that the region of linear stability of the uniform phase is given by @xmath13 note that at the upper boundary all exponents corresponding to all fourier modes @xmath14 become real and positive , whereas at the lower boundary the @xmath15 mode goes unstable to a period 2 oscillation .",
    "stability analysis of the square of the map ( [ eq_cml ] ) gives the boundaries of the linear stability region of the 2-cycle state written in a slightly different form : @xmath16    the dynamics is invariant under the transformation @xmath17 . as a consequence it turns out that there are two types of 2-cycles possible .",
    "one ( type - i ) with @xmath18=[u_{+}]-1\\ ] ] ( @xmath19 $ ] denotes the integer part ) requires @xmath20 and has a stability region bounded by the surfaces given by the following two equations : @xmath21 and @xmath22 at the upper boundary ( [ eq_l2_2 ] ) the @xmath15 mode becomes growing , while at the lower boundary ( [ eq_l2_1 ] ) a hopf bifurcation of the @xmath23 modes occurs .",
    "this is quite fortunate , since one can obtain the analytic expressions for the phase boundaries for a system of arbitrary size @xmath1 from the analysis of a system with @xmath24 .    the other ( type - ii ) 2-cycle is such that @xmath25=[u_{+ } ] \\label{eq_oneslot}\\ ] ] and , for the local map @xmath5 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_map ] ) , it can only exist at the stability boundary of the uniform state given by @xmath26 but can have an arbitrary amplitude @xmath27 , subject only to the condition  ( [ eq_oneslot ] ) .",
    "[ fig_phase ] presents two cross sections of the parameter space .",
    "we will denote the region where the uniform state ( 1-cycle ) is linearly stable as the phase l1 .",
    "similarly , the phase l2 will stand for the linear stability region of the 2-cycle state . as we are going to see later , the 2-cycle state is not the only possible asymptotic state in this phase , so it will be useful to introduce the additional subdivision of this phase into sub - phases for a more detailed analysis .",
    "the attractors of the phases t1 and t2 are chaotic . the two phases are not essentially different .",
    "one can easily find a continuous trajectory in the parameter space that would join arbitrary points in phase t1 with those in phase t2 without intersecting any phase boundary .",
    "although the dynamics of the system is somewhat different in the two phases for the set of parameters used , this distinction is introduced mostly for convenience .",
    "an important property of the system is that despite the large number of degrees of freedom the type of the attractor ( and therefore , the type of behavior , if one excludes long transients ) seems to be uniquely determined by the values of control parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 and is independent of the details of the initial state .",
    "if there exists a single attractor , then the basin of attraction is ( almost ) all configuration space . in this case",
    "averages over the attractor can be estimated as the time average from a single initial condition , and we can call the system ergodic .    indeed , numerical data suggest that the attractor is unique in most of the parameter space .",
    "however it is not always the case : close to the boundary l1-t1 a frozen pattern may form and the details of a pattern do depend on the initial conditions .",
    "so , on the timescale used in our calculations ( typically of order 1 million iterations ) the system did not appear ergodic . of course , that does not mean that the system could not become ergodic on a yet larger timescale .",
    "another exception is the regions inside the ordered phases l1 and l2 , where two attractors , chaotic and non - chaotic , can coexist .",
    "we will later discuss this situation in more detail .",
    "one of the objectives of this paper is to study the effect of the conservation law on the dynamics of the extended chaotic system .",
    "we therefore would like to follow the changes in the parameters characterizing the dynamics as a function of the conserved quantity @xmath9 .",
    "in further work we will fix the values of the other two parameters at @xmath28 , @xmath29 , which ( as seen from the phase diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig_phase ] ) will allow us to study the regimes of interest ( various chaotic as well as periodic states ) .",
    "looking at the phase diagram , one can expect that this model should experience at least four bifurcations or phase transitions limit , and the consequent possibility of universal exponents , we will use the term `` phase transitions '' rather than `` bifurcations '' . ] as @xmath9 is varied in the interval @xmath30 .",
    "equations ( [ eq_l2_1 ] ) and ( [ eq_l2_2 ] ) give us @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the boundaries of the 2-cycle stability region . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_l1 ] ) the uniform state loses its stability at @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "phase transitions from ordered to chaotic states are common occurrences in coupled map lattices @xcite",
    ". they may be continuous or discontinuous . for continuous transitions we might expect the transitions to fall into various universality classes , characterized by scaling exponents for various diagnostics of the chaos near the transition .",
    "in this case the transitions in cml s may be representative of transitions to spatiotemporal chaos in more general extended non - equilibrium systems .",
    "although the qualitative features determining the universality classes are not understood one expects that symmetries , such as the ising symmetry studied by miller and huse @xcite , and conservation laws , rather than the detailed properties of the local maps , will be important .",
    "in particular , it has been suggested @xcite that under certain very general conditions ( e.g. in systems with a unique absorbing state ) the transition should fall into the universality class of directed percolation , although some counter examples to this statement are known .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to check whether any of the phase transitions in our model belong to the universality class of directed percolation , since , as we are going to see below , the absorbing state in our model is in fact unique for any choice of control parameters .",
    "in order to understand the spatial dynamics of the system better and to see the finer details of the phase diagram we will ( following kaneko @xcite ) reduce the description of the dynamics to a finite number of states : in terms of this reduced dynamics each site of the lattice can be marked either `` laminar '' or `` turbulent '' thus making up a set of laminar and turbulent domains . then one would naively expect a laminar domain to be a region of the lattice with a relatively slow chaotic dynamics ( no large , if any , positive local lyapunov exponents @xcite ) ; and a turbulent domain to be a region where the chaotic dynamics is fast ( with at least a few large positive local lyapunov exponents ) .",
    "positive lyapunov exponents will inevitably make the turbulent domains spatially irregular , while laminar domains tend to be spatially regular .",
    "we will not put the terms `` laminar '' and `` turbulent '' in quotes below , nevertheless one should clearly understand that these are just a convenient notation and thus are restricted in meaning .",
    "we need a simple criterion that will determine whether a given site belongs to a turbulent or laminar domain ( we will only consider as laminar states those that are close to either uniform or 2-cycle configurations ) .",
    "the simple way to distinguish between ( uniform ) laminar and turbulent sites numerically would be to call a site @xmath35 laminar on time step @xmath36 if @xmath37 and turbulent otherwise .",
    "the problem with this definition is that any 2-cycle with amplitude @xmath38 would be considered turbulent , which is clearly incorrect .",
    "therefore , the definition of a laminar domain has to be generalized to include a zig - zag pattern with slowly varying envelope of arbitrary amplitude : @xmath39 in this particular model we set @xmath40 .    based on this reduction",
    "one can distinguish between various types of dynamics in the system .",
    "pictures representing the spatiotemporal evolution of the system in symbolic form are so characteristic that one can easily determine which part of phase diagram the system is in just by looking at the patterns",
    ". we will examine several typical pictures , highlighting the most interesting phenomena observed in this model .",
    "the behavior of our cml in the phase l2 is nontrivial .",
    "we already know that inside the phase there is a stable ordered state .",
    "our numerical data imply however that this ordered 2-cycle state is stable in the nonlinear sense only for values of u satisfying @xmath41 ( figure [ fig_hyst ] ) . as we are going to see later , it is quite hard to determine the critical values @xmath42 and @xmath43 exactly , but they seem to approach the fixed values @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath46 .    for @xmath47 the ordered state is reached through a chaotic transient whose lifetime is usually very small , no matter what initial condition is chosen , and thus the asymptotic behavior dominates . for relatively small systems ( @xmath48 )",
    "this results in a fast decay of any initial state into a limit 2-cycle . for larger systems",
    "the quiescent asymptotic state may be completely regular as well , but it may also have a few localized turbulent defects moving with unit speed through the homogeneous 2-cycle background .",
    "defects moving in opposite directions eventually die out colliding with each other .",
    "similar properties were observed in a number of 1- and 2-dimensional models featuring spatiotemporally intermittent dynamics ( see @xcite and references therein for example ) .    for @xmath49 as well as for @xmath50 the ordered state is only conditionally stable ( stable to small perturbations ) and most initial conditions result in a spatiotemporally chaotic asymptotic state consisting of a combination of laminar and turbulent domains , with the laminar domains featuring exactly the same structure as the ordered state : the type - i 2-cycle .",
    "therefore the phase l2 can be subdivided into three sub - phases according to whether any turbulent domains are present in the asymptotic state together with the laminar background whose structure is the same throughout the phase l2 .    fig .",
    "[ fig_hyst ] shows schematically the ( time averaged ) fraction of the lattice occupied by turbulent domains in the phase l2 as a function of parameter @xmath9 . in the sub - phase @xmath51 ( @xmath47 ) the asymptotic state is laminar . in the sub - phases",
    "@xmath52 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath53 ( @xmath50 ) the asymptotic state can be either laminar or spatiotemporally chaotic .",
    "it is interesting to note that the characteristic patterns produced by the turbulent domains are different in the two sub - phases featuring a persistent spatiotemporally intermittent state . as a result one might expect to see two quite different phase transitions at @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "a pattern typical for the sub - phase @xmath52 is presented on fig.[fig_pattern](a ) .",
    "this state is very similar to some of the spatiotemporally intermittent states of a ( 1-dimensional ) model studied by chate and manneville @xcite .",
    "the major difference is that in our model turbulent domains typically have a larger size .",
    "since the absorbing ( laminar ) state is an ordered one and is unique , we might expect a phase transition at @xmath42 to belong to the universality class of directed percolation @xcite .",
    "in fact , this kind of sti state is not specific to discrete extended systems",
    ". a very similar state can be observed in some continuous models as well , for instance @xcite , in a damped kuramoto - sivashinsky equation : @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "[ fig_pattern](b ) presents another type of spatiotemporally intermittent state that can be observed in the phase l2 .",
    "its distinguishing feature is that it is composed of a set of virtually immobile turbulent nuclei `` mediated '' by creation and absorption of nonlinear waves , propagating trough the laminar background with unit velocity .",
    "this type of `` nuclear '' sti state is characteristic for the sub - phase @xmath53 .",
    "the phase l1 also features internal structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_hyst ] ) . for @xmath58 ( sub - phase @xmath59 ) any initial configuration decays quickly into a uniform stable state .",
    "in other words , the uniform state is nonlinearly stable . for @xmath60 ( sub - phase @xmath61 )",
    "the uniform state is only conditionally stable and large deviations from it result in a spatiotemporally chaotic asymptotic state .",
    "the transition point separating the two sub - phases is estimated to be @xmath62 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "[ fig_pattern](d ) represents a frozen pattern , characteristic of the chaotic asymptotic state of the system in the sub - phase @xmath61 and in the phase t1 close to the boundary with l1 ( we will denote this region @xmath63 ) .",
    "it is probably more appropriate to call this type of dynamics locked chaos : the chaotic state is almost stationary in terms of reduced dynamics , with chaos localized in turbulent domains . as was briefly mentioned in section [ sec_phase ] , the dimensions and locations of the turbulent domains depend on the details of the initial state of the system .",
    "the laminar state in this sub - phase is uniform .    and finally , fig .",
    "[ fig_pattern](c ) gives the reduced dynamics representation of critical behavior displayed by the cml in the chaotic phase t2 close to the boundary with l1 .",
    "here we encounter yet another example of a spatiotemporally intermittent state observed in our model .",
    "the laminar state is again a 2-cycle ( more specifically the type - ii 2-cycle ) and it is also absorbing , i.e a new turbulent domain ( we will call these defects because of their small size ) can never originate inside a laminar domain , it can only be spawned by other defect(s ) .",
    "however a defect can be consumed by a laminar domain , or alternatively it can be destroyed in a collision with another defect .",
    "the most prominent feature of this picture is `` spontaneous '' creation and annihilation of turbulent pulses ( defects ) moving in different directions with different ( but constant ) velocities .",
    "therefore we may alternatively regard these defects as traveling waves .",
    "naively one would expect that the condition @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the correlation length , is necessary and might also be sufficient for the formation of a number of traveling waves .",
    "numerical results for our model support this assumption ( in disagreement with the stronger restriction @xcite , according to which the correlation length @xmath65 should be comparable to the size of the system @xmath1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , since in the strongly chaotic regime the correlation length is of order one lattice spacing , the condition @xmath64 is usually only satisfied close to the hypersurfaces in the parameter space on which the correlation length diverges , i.e. where a continuous phase transition occurs .",
    "this is clearly the case of fig .",
    "[ fig_pattern](c ) : we have a continuous phase transition at @xmath66 .",
    "deeper in the chaotic phases t1 and t2 , away from the phase boundaries , strongly chaotic behavior could be observed .",
    "here almost all sites on the lattice exhibit turbulent behavior , and only occasionally a laminar domain of a very small size is created and then quickly consumed by the neighboring turbulent sites .",
    "we would call this type of dynamics strong chaos in contrast to the mild chaos , where all chaotic dynamics is localized to turbulent domains , occupying only a part of the lattice , while the rest of it is in the laminar state .",
    "a quantitative description of the reduced dynamics is provided by the probability distribution functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 giving the probability for a turbulent ( laminar ) domain to have length @xmath69 . in order to calculate these functions",
    "numerically we used a single random initial condition and let the system evolve , counting how many times a laminar ( turbulent ) domain of a given size formed .",
    "the resulting distributions did not depend on a particular choice of the initial condition for any given set of control parameters corresponding to ergodic dynamics , i.e everywhere except the sub - phase @xmath61 .",
    "our calculations show that in the chaotic state ( away from phase boundaries ) both @xmath67 and @xmath68 decay exponentially . even more important",
    ", typical lengthscales appear to be almost independent of the value of the conserved quantity @xmath9 , being @xmath70 for laminar and @xmath71 for turbulent regions .",
    "this is consistent with the point of view that most of the system is in a turbulent state and the probability of encountering a laminar region at any particular location is very small ( but finite and independent of the system size ) and decreases rapidly with increasing domain length , while there is no spatial structures defining alternative lengthscales .",
    "the behavior of length distribution functions might be expected to change substantially as the system gets close to the phase transition points .",
    "for example , if the transition is continuous the correlation length may grow and the critical effects might introduce alternative lengthscales that would modify the form of the distribution functions .",
    "we first examine the `` percolating '' sti state characteristic of the sub - phase @xmath52 .",
    "[ fig_domain](a ) shows that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 decay exponentially for large @xmath69 .",
    "this is compatible with the assumption that the phase transition at @xmath54 might in fact belong to the universality class of directed percolation @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note though , that @xmath72 has two branches , one corresponding to even , the other to odd size of a domain . about the only useful information that one can extract from this data",
    "is typical length scales of laminar and turbulent domains , which , for @xmath73 , appear to be tens of lattice spacings for both .    in the previous section",
    "we saw that the sti states observed inside @xmath52 and @xmath53 are considerably different . as a result fig.[fig_domain](b ) , which corresponds to the `` nuclear '' state , differs from fig .",
    "[ fig_domain](a ) substantially : though @xmath67 still decays exponentially , @xmath68 does not , but has another peak at @xmath74 .",
    "this peak is not a finite size effect ( which can be shown using a larger system ) and indicates the presence of an internal spatial structure with characteristic length @xmath75 ( typical separation between the `` nuclei '' ) in the sti state .",
    "the typical width of the `` nuclei '' is , in turn , determined by @xmath67 .",
    "numerical data for a larger system ( @xmath76 ) suggest ( in contrast with the results obtained by chate and manneville @xcite ) a crossover type of behavior for the distribution of laminar domain lengths away from the onset of sti : @xmath77 as a result , if the characteristic length @xmath78 as @xmath79 we should expect a pure power law decay of @xmath68 at @xmath55 .    another interesting phenomenon ,",
    "can be pointed out in fig.[fig_domain](c ) .",
    "both @xmath68 and @xmath67 have two branches , one corresponding to even , the other to odd length of a domain .",
    "the behavior of these branches is quite peculiar , they cross at some crossover length @xmath80 : @xmath81 the difference between the branches is larger for @xmath1-even and smaller for @xmath1-odd .",
    "similar relations hold for @xmath67 , though the difference between the branches is less pronounced than in the case of @xmath72 .",
    "close to the boundary t2-l1 a typical state ( fig .  [ fig_pattern](c ) ) is composed of a collection of laminar domains separated by small turbulent defects .",
    "as we are going to see later , most of the turbulent domains tend to have a fixed length @xmath82 , independent of the distance ( in parameter space ) to the transition point .",
    "all defects move with a constant velocity , but while the majority of defects is moving with the maximal speed @xmath83 the rest have a smaller speed @xmath84 . therefore we have a considerable probability of encountering a laminar domain bounded by a pair of defects which move with equal and opposite speeds . if at some particular time @xmath36 the length of such a laminar domain was even ( odd ) , it will remain even ( odd ) for as long as these defects exist since the length will increase ( decrease ) by 2 at each time step .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the details of the `` defect interaction '' favor the creation of domains with length of a given parity , say even over odd . as a result",
    ", one will see that the probability of finding a laminar domain of small and even size @xmath69 is higher than the probability of finding a laminar domain with comparable odd size @xmath85 ( or @xmath86 ) , thus splitting the function @xmath68 into two branches .",
    "since chaotic fluctuations tend to destroy the deterministic predictions like the one we just discussed , we can not make any rigorous conclusions about the dynamics of larger laminar domains .",
    "the numerical data suggests that the characteristic lengthscales determining the decay rates of the two branches are different , so they cross at some crossover length @xmath87 determined by the average distances between the defects moving with different speeds .    in the case of a frozen pattern one should not expect the probability density to decay exponentially , rather it should display several peaks , broadened due to the chaotic fluctuations of the domain boundaries , at the lengths occurring in a particular pattern and then go sharply to zero .",
    "this applies to both @xmath88 and @xmath72 .",
    "[ fig_domain](d ) satisfies this prediction quite well .",
    "the underlying reason of this kind of behavior is the non - ergodicity of the system in the frozen pattern forming regime .",
    "the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig_domain ] imply that in the model studied in this paper simply the ergodicity of the system dynamics is a sufficient condition for the probability distribution function @xmath67 to decay exponentially at lengths greater than the correlation length @xmath65 in any disordered state . on the contrary ,",
    "the distribution of laminar domains is more specific and informative .",
    "@xmath68 still decays exponentially in the strongly chaotic states . in the spatiotemporally intermittent state",
    "however the behavior of @xmath72 varies widely : it might or might not decay exponentially .",
    "for instance , in case of the `` nuclear '' sti state we observe the crossover from exponential to power law type of decay . similarly to @xcite",
    "we expect to see a pure power law decay at the transition point @xmath55 .",
    "as mentioned above , we expect to have 4 distinct phase transitions , in which the system goes from either uniform state or 2-cycle to a chaotic state .",
    "the transition to chaos in this example of an extended system with a local conservation law does not follow the period doubling cascade or other routes to chaos characteristic of low dimensional dynamical systems , instead the system goes directly from a simple dynamical state ( fixed point , period-2 ) to a chaotic state .",
    "in other words it has a character similar to phase transitions in hamiltonian statistical systems where a symmetry of a basic state is destroyed upon crossing of the critical point .",
    "this feature is common to all the phase transitions in this model .",
    "a conventional dynamical systems approach to the treatment of phase transitions in a deterministic chaotic system would be to calculate the maximal lyapunov exponent , @xmath89 .",
    "the bifurcation from the ordered to disordered state then occurs at the values of the parameters where the exponent changes sign and becomes positive . in the case of cml with a conservation law ,",
    "one of the exponents is always zero , therefore @xmath89 does not change sign , but increases ( continuously or discontinuously , depending on the type of transition ) from zero as the system crosses the boundary between ordered and disordered phase . the maximal lyapunov exponent can be considered as an example of a global ( intensive ) order parameter .    on the other hand , in order to get some additional insight into the spatial dynamics of the system , it might be advantageous to introduce a local ( extensive ) order parameter .",
    "a good candidate seems to be the density @xmath90 of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy , @xmath91 : @xmath92 it is clearly zero in the ordered phase and positive in the disordered phase .",
    "the calculation of the lyapunov spectra is numerically costly , so a different approach is used for comparison , based on the reduced description of the system s dynamics . in terms of reduced dynamics the phase transition from the ordered to disordered state can be represented as the appearance of a set of disjoint turbulent domains on the laminar background .",
    "this leads us naturally to the measure of the set of turbulent domains , @xmath93 , as another local order parameter , describing how the laminar state becomes turbulent . in the ordered state @xmath94 , in the disordered state @xmath95 .    and ,",
    "finally , let us introduce yet another order parameter , @xmath96 .",
    "one can decompose the chaotic dynamics into modes using the karhunen - loeve decomposition @xcite .",
    "the mode intensity @xmath97 is defined as the eigenvalue of the integral equation @xmath98 where the kernel @xmath99 is just the 2-point correlation function .",
    "due to the translational invariance of the system ( in case of ergodic dynamics ) @xmath100 and therefore the eigenfunctions @xmath101 are just fourier modes .",
    "consequently , the eigenvalues @xmath97 are given by the values of the static structure function @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the fourier transform of the map variable .",
    "the total intensity of the dynamics is defined as @xmath104 .",
    "it includes the contributions from the chaotic as well the non - chaotic modes .    in the non - chaotic phases l1 and l2 the stable stationary state is given by the general formula ( [ eq_zig ] ) .",
    "therefore , the structure function might only be nonzero at two values of the wave vector @xmath105 : @xmath106 and , for a zig - zag state , @xmath107    in other words , if we want the order parameter to represent the strength of chaos in the system , it should be defined through the intensity of the chaotic modes only .",
    "so we arrive at the following expression @xmath108 which is identically equal to zero in any ordered phase and larger than zero in any disordered phase .",
    "all order parameters introduced are expected to become asymptotically independent of the system size @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath46 .",
    "most of the attention in this study was devoted to the order - disorder transition occurring at the boundary l1-t2 .",
    "this transition is easy to study and it is expected to be quite common in models described by a cml with diffusive coupling and conserved map variable density .",
    "the transition point is defined by the equation @xmath109 .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq_lambda ] ) that at @xmath110 a period 2 bifurcation occurs and the @xmath15 mode becomes growing , making the uniform configuration unstable .    details of the transition ( see next section ) suggest that this transition is a continuous ( second order ) phase transition , and the numerical data support this conclusion .",
    "one of the clear indications of this fact is presented in fig .",

    "[ fig_hyst ] ) . as a result one observes a discontinuous transition in the non - chaotic state : the laminar state abruptly turns into the chaotic one",
    ".    however , there is apparently no phase transition in the chaotic state at this point : the dynamics of the system on the t1 side of the boundary is very similar to the dynamics of the system evolving on the chaotic attractor on the l2 side .",
    "all order parameters change continuously as the system crosses the boundary from l2 to t1 .",
    "since @xmath170 as @xmath171 , changing the direction does not modify this conclusion : the chaotic attractor of the phase t1 smoothly transforms into the chaotic attractor of the phase l2 .    at @xmath54",
    "the situation is reversed .",
    "obviously there could be no phase transition in the non - chaotic state .",
    "on the other hand , the chaotic attractor does not exist in @xmath51 , therefore there should be some kind of phase transition in the chaotic state : the order parameters are zero for @xmath47 , but take on nonzero values in the chaotic state for @xmath49 .",

    "these results are consistent with @xcite .",
    "but so far we do not have reliable data that will allow us to determine whether this transition in fact belongs to the universality class of directed percolation or not .",
    "there is a similarity between the transition at @xmath54 and the continuous phase transition at @xmath110 : the laminar state becomes chaotic through the appearance of a set of turbulent domains that gradually spread over the whole system .",
    "nevertheless there is an important difference : the sti state observed inside t2 can never become completely laminar because of the conservation law , while the sti state inside @xmath52 may decay into a completely laminar state with time .",
    "the above discussion applies completely to the chaotic sub - phase @xmath53 which corresponds to @xmath50 .",

    "one particular feature of the chaotic attractor in this sub - phase is worth mentioning : for @xmath187 the measure of the turbulent set , @xmath93 grows linearly with @xmath9 .",
    "the phase transition l1-t1 at @xmath188 is also very similar to the transition l2-t1 .",

    ", the laminar state is the uniform state , not the 2-cycle .",
    "the uniform state is unstable for @xmath191 , so in order for the laminar regions to be stable the local density inside them should be in the range @xmath192 characteristic of the ordered phase l1 .",
    "this is in fact the case : the value of the local density in the laminar regions is @xmath193 .    inside @xmath194",
    "the number of positive lyapunov exponents grows linearly with @xmath93 , while the latter grows linearly with @xmath9 .",
    "this is the kind of behavior one expects in a system where all chaos is localized in turbulent domains .",
    "all three cases of hysteretic transitions observed in our model are very similar and represent many of the characteristic features of the specific route to chaos .",
    "in particular , sti appears whenever the uniform absorbing state experiences a subcritical bifurcation at the transition point ( e.g. @xmath174 ) ; the hysteresis loop forms as a result of the bistability ; onset of sti ( e.g at @xmath54 ) can be either continuous or discontinuous , depending on the types of defects supported by the laminar ( absorbing ) state ; the lifetime of the `` laminar '' transients diverges at the onset ; the confinement effects enhance the stability of the absorbing state in relatively small systems .",
    "in this section we will briefly comment on the applicability of the lyapunov dimension as a parameter characterizing the dynamics in the system under consideration .",
    "this has been used by a number of authors ( e.g. @xcite ) to assess the strength of chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "the lyapunov dimension is defined as @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath36 is such that @xmath197 .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath198 is not defined for the system considered , because for the values of the control parameters used all @xmath199 s were positive .",
    "this conclusion appears incorrect .",
    "first of all , this only happens for some restricted set of control parameters .",
    "for other values of parameters the lyapunov dimension is perfectly well defined .",
    "second , there is no problem with all @xmath199 s being positive : it only means that @xmath200 , i.e. the dimension of the attractor coincides with the dimension of the configuration space ( @xmath1 variables with one constraint ) meaning that the attractor fills the configuration space .",
    "as one can see from the fig .",
    "[ fig_dimension ] this only happens away from the boundaries inside the chaotic phases t1 and t2 , where the system is in the strongly chaotic regime with @xmath201 .",
    "the numerical results show that the lyapunov dimension thus defined is a good ( albeit costly to calculate ) measure of the strength of chaos in the system under consideration .",
    "it is a continuous function of control parameters and can in principle be used as an alternative order parameter , though it proved to be hard to calculate with the necessary precision close to the phase transition points .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that all coupled maps with a conservation law should have a singularity in the spectrum of lyapunov exponents at the value @xmath0 .",
    "the origin of the divergence of the number of lyapunov modes with negative exponents close to zero is generally explained by the following arguments .",
    "a spatially uniform autonomous system with a locally conserved density is considered .",
    "the sufficiently coarse grained asymptotic state of such a system is supposed to be uniform , i.e the density in the asymptotic state should not depend on the spatial coordinates .",
    "now a long wavelength density perturbation is imposed on such an asymptotic state . because of the conservation law the only mechanism by which such a perturbation can decay is diffusion from the regions with high average density to the regions with low average density .",
    "this process can be described by an effective diffusion equation , which can be considered as a long wavelength approximation of the original evolution equation . as a result",
    "the decay rate of a long wavelength perturbations should be given by a quadratic function of the wave vector @xmath105 .    in our model",
    "this functional dependency can be motivated by analogy with the analytic expression obtained for a stable non - chaotic phase l1 . since there is an exact 1-to-1 correspondence between fourier mode number and the decay rate in l1 , we can formally rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq_lambda ] ) , re - expressing the number of the exponent @xmath202 through the wave vector @xmath105 : @xmath203 here for @xmath204 we have @xmath205 and the density of lyapunov exponents diverges @xmath206    one can attempt to apply a similar numerical analysis in the chaotic phase .",
    "we start with writing the evolution equation ( [ eq_cml ] ) in fourier space : @xmath207 consequently the jacobian @xmath208 of the evolution transformation takes on the following form in the fourier space : @xmath209 fourier modes are not eigenvectors of this matrix ( unless all @xmath210 as in the uniform state ) , but since the off - diagonal elements are of order @xmath211 fourier modes can serve as a good first order approximation to the exact eigenvectors for @xmath105 sufficiently small .",
    "this argument suggests that wavevector @xmath105 should be a good label for the slow modes ( and small @xmath212 ) of the system in chaotic as well as spatially ordered states .",
    "numerically the lyapunov spectrum can be calculated using the qr decomposition of the product of the jacobians @xmath213 @xmath214 where @xmath215 is orthogonal and @xmath216  upper - diagonal to yield : @xmath217 the columns of @xmath218 give lyapunov vectors and the diagonal elements of @xmath219  the corresponding lyapunov exponents on the n - th step : @xmath220    figs .",
    "[ fig_spec_70]-[fig_spec_455 ] show several typical time averaged power spectra of the instantaneous lyapunov vectors along with the corresponding lyapunov spectra .",
    "the power spectra are represented in the form of the density plots showing the relative contribution @xmath221 from the fourier mode with number @xmath222 to the @xmath202-th lyapunov vector , while the lyapunov spectra show the correspondence between lyapunov vectors and exponents .",
    "the power spectra are normalized @xmath223 so that @xmath221 can alternatively be interpreted as the probability distribution functions .",
    "we would like to mention that due to the ergodicity of the dynamics the power spectra ( as well as lyapunov spectra ) should be reproducible , i.e. different initial configuration with the given set of control parameters should produce the same spectrum and this is found to be the case .",

    "one can easily notice that a singularity appears in the spectrum of lyapunov exponents ( fig .",

    "it is therefore natural to expect the small negative lyapunov exponents to be determined by the decay rate of the corresponding fourier mode .    in the long - wavelength limit @xmath204 , the latter",
    "could be determined from a hydrodynamic analysis @xcite of the problem .",
    "it was argued @xcite that at long wavelengths the effect of all short wavelength corrections to the equation of motion ( [ eq_cml_f ] ) can be combined into a stochastic noise term and a renormalized diffusion constant @xmath224 , producing an effective ( discrete ) langevin equation : @xmath225 with @xmath226-correlated noise term @xmath227 according to the central limit theorem such noise averages to small values on large lengthscales and therefore , for small @xmath105 , the decay rate of the fourier mode @xmath228 is equal to @xmath229 .    because of the conservation law one of the exponents in our model is always equal to zero",

    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath236 is in fact calculated as a time averaged decay rate of the corresponding instantaneous lyapunov vector .",

    "and they both grow with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "numerical data available so far suggests that @xmath266 as @xmath267 ( for strongly chaotic systems ) .    for",
    "@xmath268 @xmath263 drops almost to zero indicating that there is almost no diffusion in the system .",
    "indeed we know that this is the region of locked chaotic dynamics ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "so this result is not surprising : the formation of a locked structure prevents diffusion ( on any scale larger than some typical scale determined by that structure ) .",
    "we can not probe smaller scales using the dynamic structure function because the effective langevin equation ( [ eq_flang ] ) is not valid for @xmath105 large enough , but supposedly diffusion survives there .",
    "it is interesting to note however that locking has apparently no effect on the lyapunov spectrum : the change in @xmath262 is very gradual across @xmath269 .",
    "now that we have studied the dynamics of the cml with the conservation law quite thoroughly and compared the characteristic phenomena with those observed in cml s without any conservation laws we would like to discuss whether the distinguishing features are really explained by the presence of the conservation law .",
    "it is often very hard to distinguish the effect of the conservation law on the dynamics of a system from the effects introduced by other aspects of the evolution equation .",
    "here we would like to explore some consequences of violating the conservation law , trying to retain the structure of the original equation  ( [ eq_cml ] ) .",
    "first of all , we are looking for internal homogeneous perturbations that would violate the conservation law of eq .",
    "( [ eq_cml ] ) , but would preserve the structure of the equation .",
    "this is easily furnished by the following modification of the original evolution equation : @xmath270 where the local map function @xmath5 is the same as above and a perturbation @xmath271 is introduced .",
    "one can easily notice that in the simplest case of the uniform state it reduces to the equation determining the evolution of the average density @xmath272 this equation , though , does not provide us with any reliable information concerning the dynamics of the average density in the case of a nonuniform state .",
    "second , in order to be able to compare two systems , one with and one without the conservation law , we should ensure that the latter is violated only `` mildly '' .",
    "in other words , we would like the perturbed system to have a phase diagram that could be compared to that of the original system .",
    "in particular we would like to preserve the dimensionality of the parameter space .",
    "since @xmath9 is no longer conserved it is not a parameter of the dynamics .",
    "instead we introduce another parameter @xmath273 that will enter the evolution equation through the perturbation function @xmath271 .    by `` mild '' conservation violation",
    "we also mean that the change of the originally conserved average density @xmath9 during any single time - step is sufficiently small : @xmath274 we would also like the fluctuation of the average density @xmath9 to be bounded , such that @xmath275 for some finite @xmath129 at any time step @xmath36",
    ". then we would be able to compare the dynamics of the perturbed system with that of the original system with conserved quantity @xmath276 .",
    "our primary interest in this section is the relation of the conservation law to the existence of a singularity in the spectrum of lyapunov exponents .",
    "it is thus reasonable to compare the perturbed system with the original one , described by the equation  ( [ eq_cml ] ) , at the value of the conserved quantity @xmath277 , where the conserving system displays a strongly chaotic dynamics and has a lyapunov spectrum with a pronounced singularity at @xmath0 .",
    "we will start with the following choice of the ( nonlinear ) perturbation function : @xmath278 and choose @xmath279 .",
    "the dynamics of the perturbed system seems qualitatively very similar to the dynamics of the unperturbed system , but now the average density @xmath9 is not conserved and fluctuates about @xmath273 with a standard deviation of order few percent .",
    "[ fig_cube ] of the lyapunov exponent spectra focuses on the parts corresponding to slow evolution ( small @xmath212 ) . comparing the spectrum of the modified system with that of the original system for @xmath280",
    ", one can easily notice that the singularity is clearly present in the conserving case , while the spectrum of the perturbed system appears to be similar to the spectrum of the original system , but slightly tilted and shifted downwards .    in order to better understand the origin of such a metamorphosis",
    "it is advantageous to use another type of perturbation which is a lot easier to interpret and study analytically : @xmath281 since @xmath271 is linear , equation  ( [ eq_1dmap ] ) now describes the evolution of the average density @xmath9 for arbitrary initial state . for @xmath282 ( @xmath283",
    "was used ) the asymptotic state is a configuration with @xmath284 .",
    "the effective langevin equation corresponding to ( [ eq_dissip ] ) should read @xmath285    on large lengthscales noise averages out and we obtain the following dependence of the growth rate on the wave vector : @xmath286 i.e. we should expect ( for small @xmath105 s ) the lyapunov spectrum of the perturbed system to be shifted downwards by @xmath287 with respect to the spectrum of the conserving system , while retaining the same type of singularity . the total decay rate",
    "is then determined by a linear combination ( at least for small enough coupling ) of the diffusion with local dissipation .",
    "comparing the spectra of lyapunov exponents of the modified system ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lin ] ) and the original system ( fig . [ fig_cube](a ) ) for @xmath280 we see that the numerically obtained spectra of the perturbed system follow the prediction of the langevin equation ( [ eq_lan_per ] ) quite precisely for small ( @xmath288 ) as well as for relatively strong ( @xmath289 ) perturbations .",
    "we expect the negative shift of the `` slow '' part of the spectrum to be attributed to the dissipative nature of the perturbations used above .",
    "in fact we could have a positive shift or no shift at all . in order to see this",
    "we pick the nonlinear perturbation function @xmath271 with the first derivative which is not negative - definite : @xmath290 with @xmath282 .",
    "we used @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_1dmap ] ) does not hold anymore , but the numerical data suggests that the dynamics of the system is ergodic and the averaged density @xmath9 in the asymptotic state fluctuates about @xmath273 with fluctuations being again of order few percent .",
    "[ fig_lor ] shows the lyapunov spectra of the perturbed system with @xmath293 .",
    "this figure suggests that the spectrum is indeed shifted in the direction of positive rather than negative values of @xmath212 .",
    "a small perturbation ( @xmath289 ) results in a small distortion of the original spectrum : the slope of the spectrum at the value @xmath0 on both positive and negative sides becomes nonzero , i.e. the singularity in the density of lyapunov exponents disappears . the slope increases with @xmath294 and for sufficiently strong perturbation ( @xmath295 ) all traces of the singularity vanish .",
    "these examples suggest that there are , in fact , two different aspects of the singularity in the lyapunov spectrum of a system with the conservation law .",
    "the first one is the presence of a singularity at some value @xmath296 .",
    "the numerical data obtained suggests that the singularity survives in the special case of the linear perturbation function @xmath271 . a nonlinear perturbation results in the disappearance of the singularity .",
    "the jacobian of a perturbed system can be written as @xmath297 where @xmath298 is the jacobian ( [ eq_jacob ] ) of the conserving system . if @xmath271 is nonlinear the off - diagonal elements of @xmath299 become of order @xmath300 instead of @xmath211 . as a result",
    "fourier modes are no longer good as an approximation to the exact eigenvectors even for small @xmath105 .",
    "the wavevector @xmath105 can no longer label the slow modes of the system and therefore there is no reason to expect the singularity in the density of lyapunov exponents to remain .",
    "it becomes `` smoothed out '' by the perturbation .",
    "the second aspect is the actual value of @xmath301 in case a singularity is present .",
    "we already saw that imposing linear perturbation ( [ eq_dissip ] ) made @xmath301 become negative ( cf .",
    "( [ eq_qfit ] ) ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the shift of the `` slow '' part of the spectrum as a whole in response to some local effects , e.g. dissipation .",
    "we may therefore suggest , that since all known cml s with an additive conserved quantity possess a spectrum of lyapunov exponents distinguished by the presence of the singularity at @xmath0 , a conservation law is a sufficient condition for the existence of such a singularity .",
    "it seems to be a necessary condition as well , at least in the class of models ( [ eq_cml ] ) studied in this paper .",
    "the singularity at @xmath302 indicates that there is a mechanism of ( local ) dissipation concurrent with diffusion and if this is eliminated the system becomes strictly conserving",
    ". this refinement might be helpful when looking for hidden conservation laws using lyapunov spectra @xcite , numeric or experimental .",
    "all three types of perturbation studied above are seen to have an effect on the phase diagram . for @xmath303 phase diagrams in 3-dimensional parameter spaces @xmath304 and @xmath305 obviously coincide .",
    "numerical data for all types of perturbation studied suggest that gradual increase of the parameter @xmath294 makes the phase diagram of the perturbed system change continuously .",
    "the boundaries of the phases shift , making some of the phases shrink or completely disappear ( e.g. sufficiently strong perturbation of any type obliterates the phase l2 ) .",
    "other phases may expand as the stability of their basic state is enhanced ( as is the case for the phase l1 and the uniform state in the presence of a `` dissipative '' perturbation ) .",
    "we can say that , although the phase diagram is sensitive to the violations of the conservation law , it is robust with respect to sufficiently weak violations .",
    "since the changes in the phase diagram provoked by perturbations are found to be continuous , it is reasonable to expect that the phase transitions which were 1-order in the conserving system will remain 1-order after a perturbation is imposed .",
    "this leaves us an opportunity to observe how the characteristic exponents change with increasing perturbation . in our model",
    "the continuous phase transition at the boundary t2-l1 seems to be a promising point of investigation .",
    "numerical data we have at the moment does not allow us to answer an important question of whether the universality classes change if the conservation law is violated , but we plan to return and investigate this later in more detail .",
    "we have systematically investigated the properties of a coupled map lattice with dynamics constructed to satisfy a conservation law and to show spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "the conserved quantity provides an additional control parameter : as its value is changed , a rich phase diagram with a number of phase transitions between ordered and disordered states is found . both continuous and discontinuous transitions occur , as in coupled map lattices without a conservation law .",
    "the basic structure of the phase diagram is given by the linear stability boundaries of the ordered phases , although near the discontinuous transitions bistability may occur .",
    "increasing the nonlinearity , determined by the parameter @xmath8 ( see fig.1(b ) ) , renders the spatially uniform ordered phase ( phase @xmath306 ) unstable . for @xmath307",
    "the linear instability of the uniform state occurs via spatial period doubling ( the zone boundary mode goes unstable ) . for @xmath308",
    "the transition is immediately to a chaotic state , which takes the form of an increasing number of `` turbulent '' regions of roughly fixed size ( defects ) moving through the `` laminar '' background .",
    "this transition is continuous with a diverging correlation length and other scaling approaching the ordered state . for @xmath309",
    "the transition to chaos is through a series of two subharmonic bifurcations , passing first to an intermediate 2-cycle state ( the @xmath310 phase ) .",
    "the onset of chaos from @xmath310 is hysteretic . a complete subharmonic cascade is not observed .",
    "for @xmath311 the instability of the @xmath306 phase occurs through modes of all wave vectors going unstable together , and the appearance of chaos is also hysteretic with frozen chaotic domains developing .    as in thermodynamic systems",
    ", the phase transitions can be conveniently described by the use of order parameters , although since we are concerned with the growth of _ disorder _ the choice of the appropriate order parameter here is by no means obvious . in the case of the continuous transition",
    "we find that a number of proposed order parameters scale with distance to the transition point , thus allowing the evaluation of critical exponents , which may help to pin down whether _ universality classes _ for the onset of spatiotemporal chaos exist .",
    "an interesting question is whether the conservation law , which clearly affects the dynamic correlations , also changes the exponents and the universality class ( if such a classification exists ) of the phase transitions .",
    "the transition from @xmath306 to @xmath312 in the conserving model and in perturbed versions where the conservation law is weakly violated should provide a good arena for investigating this .",
    "a symbolic description of the dynamics , reducing the complex states to regions of laminar ( ordered ) and turbulent ( fluctuating ) regions is useful in describing the chaotic states near the transitions .",
    "in particular we see that the onset of chaos always happens in the form of turbulent regions gradually spreading over the laminar background .",
    "whenever the chaos appears to grow continuously , the turbulent fluctuations appear in the form of turbulent defects , usually propagating across the system , with size @xmath313 of order a few lattice spacings .",
    "similar results were obtained by kaneko @xcite for the non - conserving cml , although in our case there seems to be a stronger tendency for the defects to propagate with constant velocity .",
    "we have also studied the lyapunov eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the chaotic states .",
    "a conspicuous feature of conserving models is the singularity in the density of lyapunov exponents around @xmath314 .",
    "there is growing evidence that the singularity is associated with the existence of lyapunov eigenvectors that are labelled by the wave vector @xmath315 for small @xmath105  the singularity is then the usual van hove singularity coming from mode counting and the assumption of a smooth spectrum at small @xmath105 , i.e. @xmath316 .",
    "this leads immediately to a @xmath317 singularity in the density of exponents .",
    "some evidence for this idea comes from the work of bohr et al .",
    "@xcite who studied some models where the lyapunov spectrum can be exactly calculated , and in which the eigenvectors are trivially fourier modes , since the jacobian is independent of the dynamic variables . in these models",
    "the singularity can occur at nonzero @xmath318 , and the singularity may be to larger or smaller @xmath319 .    for the conserving ( and nontrivial ) maps we have studied ,",
    "the labelling of the lyapunov eigenvectors by the wave vector and the expression for the lyapunov spectrum , with @xmath320 and @xmath224 positive , is suggested by a hydrodynamic analysis , which associates the lyapunov eigenvectors with the diffusively decaying modes given by a long wavelength langevin description .",
    "the fourier power spectrum of the lyapunov eigenvectors provides support for this explanation : for small negative @xmath319 the power spectrum corresponding to the m - th eigenvalue @xmath321 is indeed strongly peaked around a small @xmath105 with @xmath322 with @xmath323 .",
    "note however that the diffusion constant estimated form the lyapunov spectrum may be significantly different from other estimates , and the proportionality constant @xmath324 is greater than @xmath325 which would be the value from simply counting the fourier modes . indeed",
    ", there is also a concentration of spectral power towards small @xmath105 on the positive @xmath319 side , with a peak wave vector which again appears to scale linearly with @xmath326 for @xmath202 sufficiently close to @xmath327 .",
    "hence the long wavelength fourier modes contribute appreciably to the lyapunov vectors corresponding to small positive as well as negative exponents , which explains the deviation of @xmath324 from @xmath325 .",
    "there is no understanding from the hydrodynamic approach of the positive eigenvalue long - wavelength modes and associated singularity in the density of exponents .",
    "adding the linear perturbation ( [ eq_dissip ] ) makes @xmath318 nonzero , but @xmath315 remains a good label .",
    "nonlinear perturbations that eliminate the conservation law however destroy the singularity , and presumably in this case @xmath315 is no longer a good label .",
    "thus the conservation law appears to be a sufficient condition for lyapunov spectrum singularity , but a complete quantitative understanding of this association remains lacking ."
