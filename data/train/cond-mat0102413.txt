    "the recent discovery@xcite of superconductivity in @xmath0 has lead to a flurry of activity",
    ". measurements of the boron isotope effect@xcite show that there is a shift in @xmath1 from 39.2 k to 40.2 k ( for @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively ) , a result consistent with electron phonon mediated bcs superconductivity .",
    "measurements@xcite of the upper critical field , @xmath2 , and the thermodynamic critical field , @xmath10 , as well as the specific heat are all consistent with @xmath0 being a fairly typical intermetallic superconductor with an atypically high transition temperature .",
    "although single crystal samples are not yet available , it has recently been found that dense , very high quality , wire samples of @xmath0 can be made.@xcite these samples have a superconducting transition temperature above that found for @xmath8 , as would be expected based on the natural abundance of @xmath11 .",
    "these samples allow for the direct measurement of electrical resistivity and , given that the width of the superconducting transition is narrower in @xmath0 wire than in powder or sintered pellet samples,@xcite wire samples allow for an accurate determination of the upper critical field @xmath2 . in this communication",
    "we present data on the magneto - transport of @xmath0 wires for applied magnetic fields of up to 18 t and over the temperature range 1.5 - 300 k. by a careful analysis of the resistivity data we are able to conclude that @xmath0 behaves like a simple metal in the normal state with all of our magnetoresistance data collapsing onto a single curve in accordance to kohler s rule .",
    "in addition we are able to construct the full @xmath2 curve .",
    "we find that @xmath2 is linear over a much larger temperature range than would be expected,@xcite leading to a @xmath12 16.4 t.",
    "@xmath0 wire was produced@xcite by sealing 100 @xmath13 m diameter boron fiber and @xmath14 into a @xmath15 tube with a nominal ratio of @xmath16 .",
    "given that @xmath0 is the most @xmath14 rich binary @xmath17 compound known , it was felt that excess @xmath14 would aid in the formation of the proper , stoichiometric phase .",
    "the sealed @xmath15 tube was itself sealed in quartz and then placed into a 950@xmath18c box furnace for two hours .",
    "the reaction ampoule was then removed from the furnace and quenched to room temperature . whereas the boron fiber has a diameter of 100 @xmath13 m",
    ", the @xmath0 wire has a diameter of approximately 160 @xmath13 m .",
    "although the @xmath0 wires are somewhat brittle , the integrity of the filament segments is preserved during the exposure to the @xmath14 vapor ; i.e. the fibers did not decompose , fragment , or turn into powder .",
    "the resulting wire has over 80% the theoretical density of @xmath0 and measurements of the temperature dependent resistivity reveal that @xmath0 is highly conducting in the normal state .",
    "the room temperature resistivity has a value of 9.6 @xmath13ohm - cm ; whereas the resistivity at @xmath3 = 40 k is 0.38 @xmath13ohm - cm .",
    "the zero field @xmath1 value for the wire sample is higher than that found for @xmath8 , a result consistent with the natural abundance of @xmath11 .",
    "it should be noted that both wire and sintered pellet samples synthesized in this manner tend to have very high and sharp superconducting transitions .",
    "magnetoresistivity measurements utilizing a 20 t , superconducting magnet were performed at the national high magnetic field laboratory , pulsed facility .",
    "a standard four - probe ac method was used , utilizing epotek h20e silver epoxy for making electrical contacts .",
    "the contact resistance was approximately 1 ohm . given the well - defined geometry of the samples , accurate measurements of resistivity were possible .",
    "the ac current was applied along the wire and the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the current direction .",
    "the sample was mounted in a flow cryostat able to regulate the temperature from 1.4 k to room temperature .",
    "figure 1 presents temperature dependent electrical resistivity data for a @xmath0 wire sample taken at a variety of applied fields for @xmath19 18 t. two features are clearly seen : there is a suppression of the superconducting phase to lower temperatures for increasing applied field , and there is a clear , large magnetoresistivity in the normal state .",
    "looking first at the suppression of superconductivity , the inset to fig .",
    "1 presents an enlarged view of the low temperature resistivity data . using these data ,",
    "three temperatures can be extracted from each curve : onset temperature , temperature of maximum @xmath20 , and completion temperature , where onset and completion temperatures are determined by extending the maximum @xmath20 line up to the normal state and down to zero resistivity .",
    "figure 2 presents the @xmath2 curve that we deduce from these data .",
    "in addition to the high field data taken at nhmfl ( shown as open symbols ) , data taken in a quantum design ppms system at lower fields on a sample from the same batch are also shown ( filled symbols ) .",
    "several features of this curve are worth noting .",
    "first of all it has a large temperature / field range over which it is linear ( 7 k @xmath21 32 k ) . below approximately 7",
    "k @xmath2 starts to roll over and saturate .",
    "this leads to a low temperature value of @xmath22(1.5 k ) = 16.2 t , which is significantly larger than estimates@xcite based on the assumption@xcite that the low temperature @xmath22(0 ) = 0.71 @xmath23 $ ] = 12.5 t. secondly , at high temperatures ( @xmath24 32 k ) there is a distinct positive , upward curvature associated with the @xmath2 curve .",
    "this is not unique to the current form of our sample but was also seen in resistively determined @xmath2 for sintered pellets of @xmath9.@xcite taken as a whole , the temperature dependence of @xmath22 for @xmath0 is remarkably similar to that recently found for other non - magnetic , intermetallic , boride superconductors : @xmath7 and @xmath6.@xcite in these cases @xmath2 is linear over an extended region of @xmath3 and near @xmath1 there is a distinct upward curvature . in",
    "both the case of @xmath0 as well as in the case of @xmath25 the material is a high @xmath5 , type - ii superconductor and in both cases the as grown compounds are well within the clean limit.@xcite    turning to the normal state magnetoresistivity , fig .",
    "3 shows @xmath26 vs @xmath27 on a @xmath28 plot to demonstrate that all of the data presented in fig .",
    "1 , as well as the two isothermal @xmath29 plots shown in the inset of fig . 3 , are broadly consistent with the generalized form of kohler s rule .",
    "the fact that all of these data fall ( roughly ) onto a single curve implies that there is a single salient scattering time in the normal state transport of @xmath0.@xcite this is what would be anticipated for a simple nonmagnetic intermetallic sample .",
    "it is worth noting that such a clear magnetoresistance would be much harder to detect in samples with enhanced impurity or defect scattering.@xcite    the isothermal @xmath30 data shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3 can be fit to @xmath31 with @xmath32 = 1.4 - 1.5 .",
    "in addition , the temperature dependent normal state resistance of sintered @xmath9 pellets as well as the resistivity of wire samples in zero field can be fit to a power law between @xmath33 and @xmath34 at low temperatures ( @xmath35 200 k).@xcite    finally , there is a slight upturn observed in the low - temperature @xmath36 data taken in high applied magnetic fields ( figure 1 ) .",
    "although the origin of this feature is not completely understood , similar features have been observed for other high purity , nonmagnetic intermetallic compounds.@xcite",
    "in this communication we present detailed magetoresistivity data on dense ( over 80% ) , high quality samples of @xmath0 . in the normal state",
    "we find that @xmath0 has a temperature and field dependent resistivity that is consistent with @xmath0 being a highly conducting intermetallic compound that can be synthesized so as to achieve very low residual resistivities .",
    "this allows the large values of @xmath26 to reveal themselves .",
    "the fact that the magnetoresistivity data follow kohler s rule is consistent with @xmath0 behaving like a simple metal with one dominant scattering time.@xcite    in the superconducting state we find that @xmath0 has a relatively linear @xmath2 curve with slight deviations from linearity at both high and low temperatures .",
    "this leads to a relatively high value of @xmath22(0 ) = 16.4 t. the linear behavior of @xmath2 as well as the upward curvature in @xmath2 for @xmath3 near @xmath1 is similar to behavior seen in other boron bearing intermetallic compounds ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) that have large @xmath5 values and are within the clean limit .",
    "this similarity brings up the obvious question of whether such temperature dependencies of @xmath2 are a generic feature associate with this subclass of intermetallic superconductors .",
