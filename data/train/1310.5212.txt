    "the fact that we live in an accelerating expanding universe is a well established reality today .",
    "the direct evidence of such an accelerating expansion of the universe first published by the high - z supernova search teams ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) in 1998 and early 1999 .",
    "later on , some other observations such as measurements of cosmic microwave background ( miller et al . 1999 ; bernardis et al . 2000 ; halverson et al .",
    "2002 ; benoit et al . 2003 ; mason et al . 2003 ) and the galaxy power spectrum ( spergal et al . 2003 ; tegmark et al . 2004 ; page et al . 2003 ) indicate that the expansion of our universe is speeding up currently .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that we live in a nearly spatially flat universe with approximately @xmath7 of the critical energy density being in non - relativistic matter and @xmath8 in a smooth component with high negative pressure called dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the concept of dark energy refers to a kind of exotic energy with negative pressure which has been proposed for understanding the current accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "although , dark energy has very significant effect on the evolution of the universe at large scales and the ultimate fate of our universe will be determined by this unknown component , our knowledge about its nature and properties is still very limited .",
    "we only know the following well established information about dark energy ( i ) it is an exotic energy with negative pressure which is caused the present cosmic acceleration ; ( ii ) it is non - clustering and spatially homogeneous ; and ( iii ) it was small at the early times while dominates the present universe ( at @xmath9 ) .",
    "+ the study of dark energy is possible through its equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath10 . here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the pressure and the energy density of de respectively . unfortunately , the current value of the dark energy eos parameter is not known to us yet .",
    "this is why so far many candidates have been proposed for dark energy .",
    "the first candidate for dark energy which can simply explain the observed cosmic acceleration is a cosmological constant ( weinberg 1989 ; carroll 2001 ; padmanabhan 2003 ; peebles and ratra 2003 ) with @xmath13 .",
    "however some fundamental theoretical problems , such as the fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem associated with cosmological constant lead cosmologists to think about another candidates such as quintessence ( @xmath14 ) ( wetterich 1988 ; ratra and peebles 1988 ) , phantom ( @xmath15 ) ( caldwell 2002 ) , quintom ( @xmath16 ) ( feng et al .",
    "2005 ) , chaplygin gas as well as generalized chaplygin gas models ( srivastava 2005 ; bertolami et al .",

    "quintessence dark energy models introduce a scalar field @xmath17 that is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "although , a possible solution to the cosmic coincidence problem my be provided by the attractor version of quintessence , but as dark energy , quintessence field with @xmath18 is not in agreement with the recent observations ( hinshaw et al .",
    "2009 ; komatsu et al . 2009",
    "; copeland et al . 2006 ; perivolaropoulos 2006 ) which indicate that @xmath15 is allowed at @xmath19 confidence level .",
    "since the present observational data do not exclude the possibility of @xmath20 to be less than @xmath21 , a new class of scalar field models with negative kinetic energy , known as the phantom field models ( caldwell 2002 ) have been introduced .",
    "this scenario also would encounter two essential problems namely the big rip ( caldwell et al .",
    "2003 ; nesseris and perivolaropoulos 2004 ) of the universe and the ultraviolet quantum instabilities problem ( carroll et al .",
    "since the models with a transition from @xmath22 to @xmath15 are mildly favored by recent observations , a new scenario of dark energy dubbed quintom was proposed ( feng et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this model can be considered as a combination of quintessence and phantom dark energy models which can fulfill the transition from @xmath22 to @xmath15 and _ vice versa_. + recent astrophysical observational evidences such as the large entropy per baryon and the remarkable degree of the isotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) indicate that the cosmic media is not a perfect fluid ( jaffe et al .",
    "these observed physical phenomena reveal the importance of analysis of the dissipative effects in cosmology .",
    "it is believed that the occurrence of the big rip can be avoided in dissipative dark energy models in which the negative pressure is an effective bulk viscosity ( mcinnes 2002 ; barrow 2004 ) .",

    "the effect of bulk viscosity on the background expansion of the universe has been studied from different points of view ( cataldo et al .",

    "it is worth to mention that the general theory of dissipation in relativistic imperfect fluid was first suggested by eckart ( 1940 ) , landau and lifshitz ( 1987 ) .",
    "+ it is believed that an energy transition from dark energy to dark matter could lead to a solution to the coincidence problem in cosmology ( cimento et al .",
