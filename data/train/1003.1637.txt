    "the interaction of matter with the electromagnetic field has played a dominant role in the development of our understanding of nature . in classical newtonian continuum mechanics one",
    "is concerned with dynamic processes involving the interaction of ( bounded ) classical continua with external forces and torques in space ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in relativistic continuum mechanics",
    "the theory is generalized to incorporate the concept of the spacetime manifold and formulated in terms of tensors on this manifold ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in both formulations",
    "the histories of configuration variables must be compatible with balance laws associated with possible translational and rotational symmetries of a metric structure and an associated balance law of ` energy ' . if electromagnetic fields are involved these laws are supplemented with the macroscopic maxwell equations in media . as a result of cohesive forces originating at the molecular level the interaction of a material with these ( and gravitational influences ) results in locally induced strains .",
    "these strains determine material stresses that are encoded into various ` stress - tensors ' .",
    "these in turn describe the local distribution of force and torque densities in the medium .",
    "the mathematical structure of such tensors characterizes the response of different materials to external influences .",
    "_ constitutive relations _ are relations that are used together with field equations , equations of motion and boundary conditions to fix the dynamic evolution of the independent dynamical variables .",
    "if the configuration of the system ( open or closed ) involves thermodynamic variables the classical laws of thermodynamics can be used to constrain these relations for real media . in the newtonian formulation one",
    "uses the maxwell and cauchy stress tensors @xcite , together with certain equations of state . in the relativistic formulation a primary role is played by the total stress - energy - momentum tensor for the system .",
    "the determination of these tensors , together with appropriate constitutive relations for different types of polarizable uncharged media often requires input from experiment .",
    "the electromagnetic constitutive properties and the appropriate electromagnetic stress - energy - momentum for light in moving media has been a subject of debate ( and possible confusion ) for over a century .",
    "difficulties arise in properly accounting for the local nature of the wave - matter interaction in terms of experimentally measurable effects . even for static electromagnetic fields",
    "there are ( often non - linear ) subtle interactions that induce changes in shape or volume in deformable media dependent on its thermodynamic state .",
    "there is a considerable body of opinion suggesting that in some sense the choice between different stress - energy - momentum tensors describing interactions of a material medium with an electromagnetic field is a matter of convenience and that different choices simply provide alternative descriptions of the same overall interaction @xcite .",
    "since there is no preferred tensor partition of the _ total _ stress - energy - momentum tensor into sub - tensors describing the behaviour of interacting _ sub - systems _ there can be no unique definition of a stress - energy - momentum tensor describing an interacting subsystem .",
    "thus for electromagnetic fields interacting with an electrically neutral bounded continuum it is always possible to _ redefine _ integrated electromagnetic forces and torques on the medium associated with sub - tensors according to taste , particularly if the medium is composed of piecewise inhomogeneous material subsystems or the fields are time dependent .",
    "however in order to model the _ total _ interacting system the choice of a total stress - energy - momentum tensor is necessary .",
    "if one has decided how to model a neutral but polarizable medium in the _ absence _ of externally applied electromagnetic fields then different choices of a stress - energy - momentum tensor for electromagnetic fields in the medium to describe the additional interactions with such fields will inevitable lead in general to different predictions for the interacting system .",
    "although the laws of classical electromagnetism in the vacuum are firmly established in a relativistic context there is no general agreement on how best to accommodate the dynamics of deformable media as a self consistent theory on spacetime , ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this makes any rigorous formulation of relativistic continuum mechanics of inhomogeneous dispersive polarizable media interacting with electromagnetic and gravitational fields difficult even if one contemplates using it for systems in non - relativistic motion in some frame of reference .    despite these shortcomings there",
    "has recently been a resurgence of interest in the so - called abraham - minkowski controversy and its relevance to the use of either the abraham or the minkowski form of stress - energy - momentum tensor in interpreting experiments involving electromagnetic fields in media @xcite .",
    "part of this difficulty is no doubt due to the complex nature of material responses to forces in general . from our perspective",
    "such experiments are seeking constitutive relations involving _ particular _ material systems and the macroscopic maxwell fields in media .",
    "as such it should come as no surprise that different systems might yield different responses particularly if the competing effects of electro- or magneto - striction mentioned above are contributing differently in different experiments .",
    "a number of historic experiments have sought to detect the discriminating _",
    "abraham force _",
    "this is strictly discriminatory only for homogeneous non - dispersive _ stationary _ media , so calls into question those experiments that involve media in motion .",
    "indeed the fundamental difference between the forces or torques induced by the divergence of the abraham and minkowski electromagnetic stress - energy - momentum tensors is that the former , unlike the latter , can depend _ explicitly _ on the acceleration of the medium . from this observation",
    "it is our contention that , for any specified electromagnetic constitutive relation , there remain experimental avenues offering new means to discriminate between alternative proposals for the form of the electromagnetic stress - energy - momentum tensor in media , despite the attendant inherent material constitutive complexities .",
    "in particular we argue that , in principle , the observed dependence of a time - averaged electromagnetic wave - induced torque on the angular speed of a _ materially isotropic but inhomogeneous _ uniformly rotating electrically neutral medium could be used to discriminate between the electromagnetic wave interactions described by the abraham tensor from those described by the symmetrized version of the tensor introduced by minkowski , and possibly those proposed by others .",
    "it is therefore of interest to calculate how such a torque depends on geometric properties of a cylindrical insulator , its speed of rotation and its _ electromagnetic constitutive properties_. since the medium will be assumed electrically polarizable and magnetizable ( but non - conducting ) one is immediately confronted with a number of subtleties associated with the form of this tensor and the _ material constitutive properties _ of the medium .",
    "these issues have a bearing on how one formulates the classical electromagnetic force on a macroscopic body particularly one that is accelerating .",
    "since this has led to a number of related questions in the recent literature @xcite , this article attempts to make explicit our perspective . after reviewing approaches in the newtonian framework",
    "the use of a fully covariant special relativistic framework is advocated .",
    "the essentials of this formulation are described below which should be read in conjunction with the expository material on electromagnetic theory in the language of differential forms contained in the appendix . in the following paper , applications to rotating media",
    "are discussed in this context .",
    "in order to motivate our method of analysis leading to a computation of the electromagnetic torque on an inhomogeneous rotating uncharged insulator , it is useful to place our methodology in the context of the recent literature in this subject . some of this literature is devoted to the derivation of expressions for the classical force ( and torque ) induced by electromagnetic fields on electrically neutral polarizable continua based on an underlying discrete model of electromagnetic sources .",
    "a traditional non - relativistic approach is to take as a point of departure the classical vacuum maxwell equations for the fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 in some inertial frame ( here labelled @xmath2 ) and moving point sources together with the newtonian equations of motion in @xmath3 for the sources . for a collection of @xmath4 point charges where the @xmath5-th point has mass @xmath6 and newtonian velocity @xmath7 at time @xmath8 ,",
    "the motion of each particle is given by a solution to the @xmath4 coupled ordinary differential equations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the inter - particle force and @xmath11 the resultant force on the @xmath5-th particle due to all other influences .",
    "the non - relativistic interaction of the ambient maxwell fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 with any point particle with charge @xmath14 located at @xmath15 with newtonian velocity @xmath16 is derived from the electromagnetic force @xmath17 on that particle with : @xmath18 in the gibbs vector notation .",
    "the fields themselves are in turn derived from the _ vacuum microscopic _ maxwell equation with singular sources . in the gibbs",
    "_ vector field notation _",
    "these are the equations @xmath19 respectively , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 denotes the speed of light in vacuo , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in terms of the singular dirac distribution @xmath24 . in these equations only the fundamental electromagnetic fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 play a role .",
    "multi - pole magnetization and polarization sources are defined in terms of the attributes of the charged particles and their motion as limits in a multi - pole expansion . in non - relativistic models retardation effects due to the maxwell displacement current",
    "are often ignored .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the total _ linear particle momentum _ in the system , @xmath25 , is a constant of the motion provided @xmath26 and @xmath27 . from these fundamental assumptions",
    "one may approach a continuum description from a number of distinct directions including a multi - pole expansion of the electromagnetic fields about some arbitrary point in space followed by a spatial smoothing procedure for the singular sources , in order to generate a balance law for smoothed out total non - relativistic linear momentum for the total interacting system .",
    "this yields an euler continuum description from the fundamental particle - field description .",
    "while the resulting overall continuum balance equation may not be sensitive to the precise nature of the smoothing functions the interpretation of individual forces in the eulerian balance relation may be @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to a continuum description has been to assume that the point particles are electrically neutral ( atoms or molecules ) but are endowed with elementary electric dipole moments and/or magnetic dipoles or elementary current loops .",
    "this requires that ( [ lf ] ) be changed to reflect this modification .",
    "subsequent smoothing would lead to a balance law involving force terms different from the point charge model even in the static limit .",
    "this should come as no surprise since the underlying microscopic models are different .",
    "in comparing the predictions of different continuum models one must be aware that they may differ only in their effects at the boundaries of spatially compact media .",
    "terms that may be discarded during an integration by parts in the development of the modelling process may well contribute to boundary interactions depending on the nature of the boundary conditions .    to illustrate some of these points consider the typical modelling of a homogeneous dispersion - free electrically neutral stationary medium @xcite based on a collection of point charges yielding , in some continuum limit , a time dependent volume force density on @xmath3 given by @xmath28 expressed in terms of time dependent electromagnetic vector fields on @xmath3 in a global orthonormal cartesian frame with basis @xmath29 and cartesian coordinates @xmath30 .",
    "the force vector on a finite volume @xmath31 of the medium is then @xmath32 in ( [ swig ] ) , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 are spatially smoothed time - dependent electric and magnetic dipole fields on @xmath3 obtained by truncating a particle force multi - pole expansion . prior to smoothing they can be expressed in terms of the charge , position and velocity of the electrically charged constituents of the medium relative to some arbitrary point and the bulk velocity in the medium .",
    "they are superscripted to indicate that these fields are referred to an inertial ( laboratory ) reference frame @xmath2 . in principle",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are determined from the continuum limit of the particle equations of motion . in practice",
    "this is difficult so one resorts to constitutive relations and assumes a form for the bulk motion of the continuum . with these closure relations the vacuum maxwell system absorbs the smoothed polarization and magnetization sources into the phenomenological fields @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in view of the covariant language used in the rest of this paper , it is useful to write ( [ swig ] ) in tensor form using the killing symmetry of the euclidean structure defined by the metric of 3-dimensional space . the reader should consult the appendixfor a self - contained formulation of the maxwell system in terms of the frame dependent differential 1-forms @xmath37 on space and their definition in terms of a unit time - like vector field @xmath2 and the maxwell and excitation 2-forms @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively on 4-dimensional spacetime endowed with the lorentzian metric tensor field @xmath40 , [ l ] , [ t ] , [ q]$ ] where @xmath41 $ ] has the unit of the coulomb in this system .",
    "we adopt @xmath42=[l^{2 } ] ,      [ g]=[j]=[q],\\,[f]=\\frac{[q]}{[{\\epsilon_{0}}]}$ ] where the permittivity of free space @xmath43 has the dimensions @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "note that the operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 defined in the appendixpreserve the physical dimensions of tensor fields but with @xmath42=[l^{2}]$ ] , for @xmath47-forms @xmath5 in @xmath48 dimensions , one has @xmath49=[\\alpha ] [ l^{4 - 2p}]$ ] . ] . in a cartesian coordinate system on @xmath3 , the covariant and contra - variant metric tensor fields are @xmath50 and in these coordinates the associated translational ( killing ) vector fields are @xmath51 ( for all time @xmath8 ) satisfying @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath53 is any of these killing fields , then , we define the @xmath54-dual of any 1-form @xmath5 to be the vector field @xmath55 . similarly , for any vector @xmath56 , we define the @xmath54-dual 1-form @xmath57 . ]",

    "charge @xmath78 and current @xmath79 .",
    "the exact 3-form in the last term will contribute to forces on the spatial boundary of the medium unless they happen to be zero as a result of boundary conditions satisfied by the fields there .",
    "the remaining terms describe local forces depending on inhomogeneities arising from the spatial rate of change of polarization and magnetization in the system .",
    "the above derivation of the structure of a local newtonian force density in a neutral macroscopic continuum in an electromagnetic field starts with a particular non - relativistic model in an inertial frame . we stress that in the absence of dynamical information about the polarization and magnetization the cogency of ( [ model1 ] ) demands a knowledge of supplementary constitutive relations to accommodate the response of the medium ( via @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) to the fundamental fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "one could proceed to express this force density as the sum of the spatial divergence of a time dependent maxwell second rank stress tensor on @xmath3 and a time derivative modulo boundary terms . adding",
    "the cauchy tensor describing the medium in the absence of electromagnetic forces to such a maxwell stress tensor would give the total cauchy stress for the medium ( in the presence of fields ) that enters into the local balance law for non - relativistic linear momentum for the complete interacting system .",
    "the classical local dynamics of this system follows as a solution to such a balance law and requires implementation of interface conditions at media boundaries or interfaces where material properties of the continuum are discontinuous .",
    "the latter constraints benefit from a distributional reformulation that has been discussed more fully elsewhere @xcite .",
    "an alternative point of departure for the modelling process is to start with a fully covariant total symmetric stress - energy - momentum tensor @xmath80 for a medium interacting with classical fields on a general spacetime .",
    "the fully covariant local classical equations of motion of the medium are then postulated to be given by @xmath81 together with equations for the fields . here",
    "the divergence operator @xmath82 is defined with respect to the levi - civita connection @xmath46 on spacetime .",
    "the fundamental property of @xmath80 is that it acts as a source of einstein gravitation . in most classical considerations one",
    "demands @xmath83 for all future pointing timelike unit vector fields @xmath2 , reflecting the attractive nature of gravitation and @xmath84 is then identified with local mass - energy density in the frame @xmath2 . in a source - free region of spacetime",
    "containing only electromagnetic fields this condition is maintained and identifies field energy .    in a spacetime with local isometries generated by a set of killing vector fields associated with the spacetime metric @xmath40 , @xmath80 can be used to generate a set of closed 3-forms on spacetime .",
    "the vanishing of the exterior derivative of each form in this set can in turn give rise to a conservation law when integrated over a regular 4-dimensional domain of spacetime provided the forms are free of singularities there",
