    "the state of a superconductor in the contact region of @xmath0 or @xmath8 structures ( @xmath9 stands for a constriction or microbridge ) in the current regime has been attracting the attention of researchers for a long time .",
    "the simplest model @xcite taking into account the violation of superconducting state by a critical current density or joule heating assumes a local equilibrium between quasiparticle excitations , the condensate , and phonons .",
    "a similar model was worked out by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite for explaining the @xmath10 oscillations of the @xmath11 point contacts .",
    "however , the investigations of metals by the point - contact spectroscopy methods showed that in most cases there is no local equilibrium between electrons and phonons in the current concentration region @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is no equilibrium in a superconductor between quasiparticle excitations and the condensate , which is manifested in the disbalance between the population densities of the electron- and hole - like branches in the spectrum of quasiparticle excitations .",
    "it has been shown by yanson et al .",
    "@xcite that the jumplike decrease in the excess current with increasing bias voltage @xmath12 for @xmath0 point contacts @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 in which the spectral regime of current passage is observed in the entire interval of applied bias voltages , i.e. , the inequality @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath3 is the contact diameter and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the inelastic and elastic electron mean free paths ) associated with the attainment of the critical concentration by the nonequilibrium quasiparticles is observed and is essentially of nonthermal type . in highly pure @xmath14 contacts of size",
    "@xmath20 ( @xmath1 is the coherence length of the superconductor ) , this decrease is of the order of several percent and is accompanied by an increase in the differential resistance of the same order of magnitude .    in the present work , a steplike structure of the ivc",
    "is observed in @xmath0 type point contacts between the single crystals of @xmath6 , @xmath21 and noble metals @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "this structure is reminiscent of the ivc structure associated with the formation of the phase slip centers in thin superconducting filaments .",
    "such a structure appears when @xmath2 is of the order of , or smaller than , @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown that the formation of this structure has a nonthermal origin and is associated with an essentially nonequilibrium state of the superconductor in the contact region . in the same way as the emergence of a nonequilibrium singularity on the ivc of tantalum point - contacts upon a decrease in temperature is associated usually with the characteristic energies @xmath24 of the phonon spectrum @xcite , the jumps in the excess current and differential resistance on the ivc appearing upon a temperature decrease of superconducting point contacts with a small @xmath1 are also fixed near certain characteristic energies @xmath25 corresponding to the characteristic energies of the phonon spectrum @xcite or other excitations with which the conduction electrons effectively interact @xcite . on the other hand , the multiplicity of the jumps in the differential resistance may lead to oscillating @xmath10 dependences which are frequently observed in experiments @xcite .      * 1 .",
    "* @xmath26 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the ivc of an @xmath0 point contact between a freshly cleaved single crystal of @xmath6 and a copper needle oriented at right angles to the basal plane ( see the upper inset to fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "junction having a resistance @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "the dot - and - dash line shows the predicted ivc in the normal state , the dashed line corresponds to discrete values of differential resistance at the steps 60 , 117 , 150 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the upper inset shows the geometry of the experiment , and the lower inset shows the initial segement of the ivc ( the dashed lines are the tangents to various segments of the ivc.,width=302 ]     model of a point contact in the form of a circular hole of diameter @xmath3 in an impenetrable partition ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the dashed curves are the boundaries between different nonequilibrium state regions of the superconductor , which are separated from the contact center by integral multiples of @xmath2.,width=302 ]    for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the energy gap along the @xmath9-axis ) , the electric field penetrates the superconductor to a depth @xmath32 ( @xmath18 is the mean inelastic relaxation time for quasiparticles with energies @xmath33 ) , and the differential resistance is apparently determined by the resistance of the ellipsoid with @xmath34 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "this resistance is much higher than the zero - bias resistance ( @xmath35 ) ( see the lower inset to fig.[fig1 ] ) associated with the normal face . in the model considered by us ,",
    "it is significant that the contact diameter is small in comparison with the inelastic relaxation length of quasiparticles in the normal faces ( @xmath36 ) for all bias voltages @xmath37 . for noble metals , this is obviously valid for @xmath38 .",
    "hence , electrons ( holes ) are incident from the normal metal on the @xmath39 interface with an excess energy relative to the electrochemical pair potential in the superconductor ( right up to @xmath37 ) .",
    "subsequent regions of ivc in fig.[fig1 ] are reminiscent of peculiarities caused due to the formation of phase slip centers in a thin superconducting filament .",
    "the differential resistance @xmath40 changes abruptly on quasilinear segments of ivc : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 . a consistent decrease in the value of the increment @xmath45 in successive steps is in qualitative agreement with the model with a jumpwise displacement of the @xmath46 boundary into the bulk of the superconductor ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) . here , @xmath47 is the superconducting region adjoining the constriction with a large nonequilibrium concentration of quasiparticle excitations into which the electric field penetrates , and @xmath48 is an equilibrium superconductor- corresponding to the state away from the constriction . in this model , we assume that the penetration depth @xmath49 magnetic field into the superconductor is larger than @xmath3 . it is obvious that even for voltages that exceed the region where the steps are observed , the excess current on the ivc continues to be finite and nearly constant .",
    "this means that the order parameter ( energy gap ) in the contact region",
    "@xmath47 also has a finite value whose order of magnitude is equal to its unperturbed value .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the ivc of another junction , viz .",
    ", @xmath53 , at different temperatures . as the temperature * decreases * , the `` critical '' current @xmath54 and power @xmath55 corresponding to a transition from the first to the second step decrease instead of increasing , as would be the case if the ivc jumps were due to the trivial destruction of superconductivity as a result of heating or the attainment of the critical current density along certain current paths .",
    "the observed temperature dependence of the ivc points towards a significant role of nonequilibrium quasiparticles . among other things",
    ", the concentration of such particles is determined by the relaxation time which increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "consequently , the `` critical '' concentration of nonequilibrium quasiparticles , which is one of the reasons behind the phase lamination in a nonequilibrium superconductor at low temperatures , is attained at a lower injection rate ( lower @xmath54 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the normal increment ( @xmath57 ) in the differential resistance at the quasilinear region corresponding to the second step is double the increment ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "since the resistance @xmath59 for small values of @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath61 ( see ) , it can be surmised that the resulting structure will be identical to that of the phase slip centers .",
    "indeed , for @xmath62 , the main part of the current in the superconductor near the @xmath39 boundary is transported by the quasiparticle excitations which recombine to form pairs at a distance @xmath2 from the constriction .",
    "if the current density @xmath63 at this distance is less than @xmath64 , such a state is stable .",
    "otherwise , a narrow layer ( phase slip plane or psp ) is formed at a distance @xmath65 from the constriction .",
    "this layer has a suppressed order parameter @xmath66 and generates new quasiparticles capable of transporting the `` supercritical '' current further into the bulk of the superconductor to a depth @xmath67 .",
    "such a process is repeated with increasing current until the spatial region covered by it exceeds the current spread region of the order @xmath3 .",
    "it is obvious that the sharply steplike nature of the ivc may be observed only under the condition @xmath68 , and the number of observed jumps is of the order @xmath69 .",
    "the contribution of the superconducting face to the contact resistance is given by @xmath70 ( @xmath61 is an odd integer ) .",
    "it follows hence that the resistance of the entire contact for large values of @xmath12 and at the first step are given , respectively , by @xmath71 while the ratio @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73 the contact diameter can be estimated from @xmath74 .",
    "unfortunately , the exact value of the resistivity @xmath75 in the region adjoining the contact is now known .",
    "it may be much larger than @xmath76 measured for a bulk sample along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "of the two different @xmath53 contacts whose characteristics are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] , we choose the latter for numerical estimates since it has a lower resistance , and hence a value of @xmath75 closer to the bulk value , for nearly the same number of steps on the ivc ( and for the same value of the ratio @xmath72 ) . substituting @xmath77 and @xmath78 into , we obtain @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the coherence length in @xmath6 is quite small : @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "hence the formation of narrow psp layers with a suppressed gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is quite possible .",
    "obviously , the number of observed steps must increase as the inequality @xmath29 , becomes more stringent .",
    "however , in this case @xmath3 must not exceed the inelastic mean free path of phonons , since the thermal regime will set in otherwise . in this connection , it is interesting to use high - temperature superconductors which have record - low values of @xmath1 and @xmath84 .",
    "fig4]a      shows the ivc of a point contact formed by @xmath21 and silver as a result of first touches between the electrodes in liquid helium .",
    "the contact geometry is shown in the inset .",
    "it can be seen that the ivc comprises a large number of ( about twenty ) steps with a gradually increasing slope @xmath92 . for subsequent touches between the electrodes , the stepwise structure of the ivc",
    "is indistinguishable but its existence can be clearly seen in the first derivative plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "the number of steps decreases in comparison with the preceding contact and their arrangement reveals a regularity manifested in a smooth decrease in the distance between spikes in @xmath88 with increasing step number .",
    "the envelope @xmath89 , shown by a dashed line , has minima at @xmath93 which can be interpreted as manifestations of the energy gap @xmath94 due to a small `` tunneling '' component of the current emerging as a result of the reflection of a part of the electrons at the physical boundary between the superconductor and the normal metal .",
    "the nonlinearity of ivc for @xmath95 vanishes at @xmath96 ( this temperature corresponds to the end of the resistive transition of the bulk sample into the superconducting state ) .",
    "taking this temperature as @xmath97 , we obtain @xmath98 , which is anomalously large ( as compared to the value given by the bcs theory ) and is nearly equal to the frequently encountered values in the tunnel- or point - contact studies of high - temperature superconductors .    in the same series of experiments , subsequent mutual displacements of electrodes lead to the disappearance of the above - mentioned structure of @xmath92 caused , in our opinion , by the discrete nature of the displacement of the @xmath46 boundary , and also to a considerable decrease in the gap value @xmath66 to about @xmath99 , which points towards a partial degradation of superconducting properties near the contact ( fig . [ fig4]c ) .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that the regular stepwise nature of ivc of point contacts involving superconductors with short @xmath1 and @xmath2 is observed only for an unperturbed superconductor with a perfect lattice .",
    "the disorder , which is created during the formation of the point contact and is manifested , among other things , in a reduced ( or averaged over different directions ) gap , prevents the formation of a regular system of phase boundaries @xmath100 in the contact region .",
    "this explains the absence of a regular structure of @xmath101 in the studies involving hts ceramic materials .",
    "shows the @xmath106 structure for another contact formed by the same single crystal , recorded at two different temperatures . as the temperature increases , a small displacement of some peaks towards higher voltages can be observed .",
    "this displacement is analogous to the one discussed above for @xmath107 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "such an effect is observed more clearly upon the application of an external magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the characteristics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] correspond to a polycrystalline sample obtained by cooling the melt .",
    "this may be the reason behind the irregular structure of @xmath106 .",
    "it can be seen that the magnetic field considerably decreases the intensity of peaks .",
    "the @xmath106 peaks are broadened and displaced towards * higher * energies .",
    "hence , it can be concluded on the basis of the temperature and field dependences presented above that the sharp peaks in the @xmath106 dependence are not associated with the usual mechanism of the violation of current paths in inhomogeneous hts samples due to heating or a local increase in the critical current density . using formulas - , we can estimate the order of magnitude of the effective diffusion depth @xmath2 quasiparticle excitations in an hts . using the value @xmath111 for @xmath112",
    ", we obtain the current diameter @xmath113 . proceeding from fig .",
    "[ fig4]b as a typical case , the number of layers of thickness @xmath2 in the current concentration region is estimated at about 10 .",
    "consequently , @xmath114 , which is smaller than the corresponding value for @xmath107 by an order of magnitude .",
    "let us clarify the meaning of the effective diffusion depth @xmath2 of quasiparticles .",
    "quasiparticles with an excess energy relative to the electrochemical pair potential ( right up to @xmath37 ) are injected , into the hts layer adjoining the @xmath39 boundary . however , if @xmath62 , the quasiparticles rapidly relax to states above the energy gap , and hence the value of @xmath115 is mainly determined by the quasiparticles having an excitation energy of the order of @xmath66 . for such quasiparticles , it is reasonable to use the values @xmath116 at @xmath117 , as was indeed done by us in this paper .    for the sake of comparison , it is worthwhile to consider the results of point - contact investigations in @xmath118 , @xcite whose epi function is well known . as a rule ,",
    "the @xmath0 contacts with noble metals reveal only one nonequilibrium singularity .",
    "it was mentioned above the this singularity has a rather weak intensity and can therefore be associated with the formation of an @xmath46 boundary at the periphery of the current spread region . in many cases ,",
    "the nucleation of this singularity was ascribed to the characteristic phonon energies on the @xmath37 axis .",
    "it is also worth noting that an analysis of the point contacts formed by the @xmath119 single crystals and @xmath22 also reveals a stepwise structure of the ivc whose main features are analogous to those for the @xmath107 contacts described above .",
