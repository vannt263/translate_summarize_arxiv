    "when discrepencies arise between observations of light isotope abundances and the predictions of standard ( homogeneous and isotropic ) big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) models research has turned to bbn models with inhomogeneous baryon distributions ( ibbn models ) to attempt to resolve the discrepencies .",
    "articles in the 1970 s and 1980 s looked for ibbn models with an overall baryon density that both equalled the critical density and satifised observational constraints on the light elements .",
    "@xcite these ibbn models could not satisfy observational constraints to isotope abundances for baryon densities other than densities demanded by standard models . in the late 1990 s observations of @xmath8he and deuterium placed conflicting constraints on the baryon density in standard models .",
    "( kks , 1999 ) @xcite found a range of agreement for the outer fringes of the @xmath9 ranges of the observations using an ibbn model code .",
    "most recently ( ks , 2000 ) @xcite used an ibbn model to bring baryon density constraints from cosmic microwave background observations in agreement with constraints from @xmath8he and deuterium observations , though not with @xmath10li observations .",
    "nucleosynthesis models have become more descriptive as they include smaller effects that faster computers can calculate accurately .",
    "one effect is the neutrino heating effect .",
    "electrons and positrons pass a fraction of their energy to neutrinos through annihilation and scattering . that energy transfer can change the rates of neutron - proton interconversion , and then the results of nucleosynthesis .",
    "hannestad and madsen @xcite derive a means of solving the boltzmann transport equation for the neutrino distribution functions , presenting results for a standard bbn model .",
    "this author will discuss the neutrino heating effect in an ibbn model .",
    "this article will show how the heating effect slightly alters neutron distribution and nucleosynthesis , and show the effect s dependence on ibbn parameters .",
    "the ibbn code for this article corresponds to a model with a spherically symmetric baryon distribution .",
    "the model is divided into a core and 31 inner shells with high baryon density , and 32 outer shells with low baryon density .",
    "a run starts at electromagnetic plasma temperature @xmath11 100 gk . the distance scale @xmath12 , the radius of the model when @xmath11 100 gk , can be varied . during a run",
    "the number density @xmath13 of isotope species @xmath14 in shell @xmath15 is determined by the equation @xcite    @xmath16 +                 \\frac{n^{n_{k}}(k , s ) n^{n_{l}}(l , s)}{n_{k } ! n_{l } ! } [ kl ] \\right )                              \\nonumber \\\\                        &    & - 3 \\dot{\\alpha } n(i , s ) + \\frac{1}{r^{2 } }      \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\left ( r^{2 } d_{n }                           \\frac{\\partial n(i , s)}{\\partial r } \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term corresponds to nuclear reactions and beta decays within shell @xmath15 , the second term to the expansion of the universe , and the third term to diffusion of isotope @xmath14 between shells . in this model",
    "only neutrons diffuse .",
    "as @xmath17 falls neutrons diffuse from the high density shells to the low density shells , until the neutrons are homogeneously distributed .",
    "the weak reactions n + @xmath18 p + e@xmath19 , n + e@xmath20 p + @xmath21 , and n @xmath22 p + e@xmath23 convert protons in the high density shells to neutrons , which then diffuse into the low density shells where the weak reactions convert them back to protons .",
    "nucleosynthesis occurs earlier in the high density shells , depleting neutrons .",
    "neutrons from the low density shells then back diffuse into the high density shells until nucleosynthesis incorporates all neutrons into nuclei , mostly @xmath8he nuclei .    figure ( 1a ) shows the mass fraction @xmath3 of @xmath8he nuclei produced by the model , as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath12 ( in centimeters ) .",
    "contour lines correspond to specific values of @xmath3 .",
    "neutron diffusion occurs later as @xmath12 increases .",
    "the shape of the contour lines is determined by when neutron diffusion occurs compared with the weak reaction rates mentioned above and with nucleosynthesis . as @xmath12 increases the time of neutron diffusion coincides less and less with the time before the weak reactions fall out of equilibrium .",
    "more protons then remain in the high density shells .",
    "when @xmath25 25000 cm the innermost shells retain all their protons , and nucleosynthesis occurs earlier enough that nearly all neutrons back diffuse into the high density shells to undergo nucleosynthesis .",
    "@xmath3 increases as @xmath12 increases to 25000 cm .",
    "but for larger @xmath12 neutrons can not reach the innermost shells before nucleosynthesis , leading to decreasing production of @xmath8he .",
    "@xmath8he production bottoms out at @xmath25 790000 cm when diffusion occurs at the same time as nucleosynthesis .",
    "for higher @xmath25 the high density shells and the low density shells act separately from each other , with the high density shells producing large amounts of @xmath8he .    to calculate the neutrino heating effect",

    "the distribution functions are used to calculate the neutrino energy densities , and @xmath28 for electron neutrinos is used to calculate the neutron - proton conversion reaction rates .",
    "increased @xmath28 makes the conversion reactions produce fewer neutrons for nucleosynthesis , but decreased electron energy density @xmath29 makes those reactions produce more neutrons at the same time . decreased @xmath29 decreases temperature @xmath17 , making nucleosynthesis occur earlier , when more neutrons are present .",
    "this last effect , the clock effect , ultimately determines the increase in @xmath3 due to neutrino heating .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath30 is calculated from collisions between neutrons and electrons / positrons ( @xmath31 ) and neutrons and protons ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "@xcite    @xmath33    neutrino heating affects @xmath31 by lowering the electron number density @xmath34 and lowering the electromagnetic plasma temperature @xmath17 at a given time .",
    "the neutrinos and the electrons / positrons are homogeneously distributed throughout this model .",
    "so @xmath31 is the same for all the shells .",
    "figure ( 2a ) shows the neutron diffusion rates into and out of shell 3 , a high density inner shell , for the case of @xmath35 3.0 and @xmath25 25000 cm .",
    "figure ( 2a ) also shows the change in the rates due to heating .",
    "this change is at first positive , and then becomes negative .",
    "this change corresponds to a shift in the diffusion rate to a time earlier by 0.1 % .",
    "all other shells also have this earlier time shift .",
    "figure ( 2b ) shows the number densities of neutrons ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath8he nuclei ( @xmath37 ) at around @xmath11 0.8 gk , when nucleosynthesis occurs , for shell 3 and the same values of @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "figure ( 2b ) also shows the changes in @xmath36 and @xmath37 due to neutrino heating .",
    "the clock effect mentioned above is seen in the humps in the graphs for the changes @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are larger between the time when neutrons are converted to @xmath8he nuclei with the heating effect on and when neutrons are converted to @xmath8he nuclei without heating .",
    "figure ( 1b ) shows @xmath40 , the change due to neutrino heating . for the ranges of @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath12 observed @xmath41 remains within a range of @xmath42 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] .",
    "@xmath3 is determined by the baryon number densities in the shells , and those densities also determine the magnitude of the clock effect .",
    "that seems to account for the contour lines of @xmath41 tracking the contour lines of @xmath3 itself .",
    "the heating effect on @xmath3 seems to be similar to the effect one would get by shifting the value of @xmath24 upwards by about 1 to 2 % .",
    "the earlier shift in neutron diffusion due to heating would have the effect of the lines in figure ( 2a ) being stretched to higher values of @xmath12 .",
    "so for a given value of @xmath12 and @xmath24 the change @xmath41 will have a value corresponding to @xmath3 at that point in the graph plus a shift corresponding to a lower value of @xmath12 .",
    "the change is bigger for @xmath43 25000 cm , when @xmath3 decreases with decreasing @xmath12 , and is smaller for 25000 cm @xmath44 790000 cm when @xmath3 increases with decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "figure ( 3a ) shows the overall abundance ratio @xmath6 between deuterium and protons .",
    "figure ( 3b ) shows @xmath45 $ ] , the change due to neutrino heating .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates that create and destroy deuterium depend on the electromagnetic plasma temperature @xmath17 and on shell @xmath15 s baryon energy density @xmath46 . through @xmath17 neutrino heating shifts the nuclear reaction rates to a slightly earlier time .",
    "so for @xmath47 cm less deuterium remains at the end of a run .",
    "this decrease in @xmath6 due to heating turns out to be one order of magnitude less than the decrease that would come from an increase in @xmath5 mentioned above . for @xmath35 3.0 and @xmath25 25000",
    "cm one has to increase @xmath24 by 1.53 % to increase @xmath3 by as much as neutrino heating does . but that upward shift would decrease @xmath48 $ ] by around 9.19 @xmath49 , instead of the decrease of 1.12 @xmath49 done by heating",
    ". for @xmath50 cm the low density outer shells produce considerable amounts of deuterium . in",
    "that range the heating effect increases deuterium production .",
    "the neutrino heating effect on @xmath8he can then be distinguished from a shift in @xmath5 by looking at how @xmath6 differs from the results without heating .",
    "the neutrino heating effect increases the mass fraction of @xmath8he by @xmath42 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] for the observed range of baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath51 $ ] and distance scale @xmath52 $ ] cm . that s the same order of magnitude as in the standard case .",
    "the increase in the mass fraction resembles the increase that would come from increasing @xmath5 by about 1 % to 2 % .",
    "the heating effect also decreases deuterium production .",
    "but the decrease in deuterium is an order of magnitude less than the decrease that would come from the increase of @xmath5 mentioned above .",
    "further , the effect increases deuterium production for @xmath53 cm .",
    "a larger future article can show the earlier time shift of neutron diffusion for values of @xmath5 and @xmath12 other than 3.0 and 25000 cm , and for shells other than shell 3 as well .",
    "these graphs would show how this time shift is characteristic of the whole observed range of @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "the article can also look at deuterium production for @xmath12 lower than and higher than @xmath54 cm , to explain in more detail how the change due to neutrino heating changes signs .",
    "the article can also comment on production of other isotopes , such as @xmath10li .",
    "one can determine if the change due to heating has a distance scale dependence similar to the dependence for deuterium .",
    "one should note that cmb observations have placed parameters on the baryon - to - photon ratio ( @xmath55 where @xmath56 ) @xcite .",
    "a future article should particularly look at the ibbn code s behavior in regions corresponding to these parameters ."
