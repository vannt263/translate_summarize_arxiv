    "globular clusters are excellent laboratories for studying the dynamics of a stellar system .",
    "the high density of stars near their centers results in frequent interactions  e.g . ,  single star - single star , single star - binary , and binary - binary .",
    "such interactions redistribute energy throughout the cluster and drive its global evolution on the so - called `` two - body relaxation '' timescale .",
    "this can sometimes be comparable to the typical orbital period of stars near the cluster center , and significantly shorter than the cluster age , implying that dynamical evolution is important .",
    "the orbital period or crossing / dynamical time is related to the core radius ( the characteristic length scale associated with the inner density profile ) and the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "it is customary to characterize the radial distribution of various stellar populations in terms of the core radius ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the inner stellar density profile of a globular cluster is suggestive of its evolutionary state ( @xcite ) .",
    "most clusters are characterized by constant density cores , well fit by models based on a relaxed , maxwellian distribution function of stars out to the limiting ( tidal ) radius ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "about twenty percent of all globular clusters appear to have undergone catastrophic gravothermal collapse as a result of runaway energy loss from the core due to two - body relaxation ( @xcite ; see the recent review in @xcite ) .",
    "even these post  core - collapse ( pcc ) clusters , however , are _ not _ expected to develop central singularities as heating by binaries will drive a `` quasi - steady post - collapse '' stage followed by gravothermal oscillations . theoretical modeling suggests that clusters in the post - collapse phase should have core radii in the range @xmath10@xmath11 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or even as large as @xmath12 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath13 is the half - mass radius .",
    "these calculations are based on a single - mass stellar population ; models with a realistic stellar mass function could yield a larger core radius .    the globular cluster",
    "47  tucanae has been studied extensively , and has long been considered a prototypical relaxed globular cluster ( @xcite ) with a large core radius : @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations of a variety of exotic objects , such as millisecond pulsars ( @xcite ) , x - ray sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and nine  stars whose velocities differ from the cluster mean by @xmath15  km  @xmath16 ( @xcite ) , have raised the possibility that 47  tuc may be approaching core collapse . the half - light ( or half - mass ) radius of 47  tuc is @xmath17 ( @xcite ) , so",
    "if it has undergone core collapse it should have a core radius in the range @xmath18 to @xmath19 ( following @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "two recent determinations of the core radius of 47  tuc fall within the upper end of this range , as discussed in  2 below .",
    "moreover , @xcite have constructed nonparametric dynamical models based on the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles , and conclude that the mass profile of 47  tuc is as centrally concentrated as that of m15 .",
    "the density profile slope of 47  tuc beyond @xmath20 is found to be similar to that seen in fokker - planck simulations of pcc clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "ground - based studies typically use integrated surface brightness measurements to determine a cluster s density profile ( cf .",
    "a substantial fraction of the optical light of a cluster comes from a handful of the brightest red giant branch ( rgb ) stars so that the effective poisson error associated with integrated light measurements is large .",
    "this kind of `` sampling '' error makes the measured density profile noisy , and any error in the center determination tends to bias the measured core radius towards large values . _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images , even with the aberrated pre - refurbishment point spread function ( psf ) , offer the advantage of resolving individual stars down to the main sequence turnoff even in the cluster core ( guhathakurta et  al .",
    "1992 , hereafter gysb ) .",
    "star counts are more representative of the stellar mass density than the integrated light , and the effective poisson errors are smaller ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is preferable to work at short wavelengths ( e.g. ,  the @xmath4 band ) where the brightest rgb stars are suppressed relative to the more numerous , bluer faint subgiants : this reduces sampling effects in integrated light measurements and increases the degree of faint star completeness ( most notably in the vicinity of bright giants ) for star count measurements ( calzetti et  al .",
    "1993 ; de marchi et  al .",
    "1996 , hereafter dpsgb ) .",
    "this paper focuses on the question : what is the core radius of 47  tuc as defined by the radial distribution of evolved stars ?",
    "it examines recent measurements of the density profile of 47  tuc that appear to be in disagreement with one another .",
    "in particular , the _ hst _ wide field / planetary camera  1 ( wfpc1 ) data set analyzed by dpsgb is reanalyzed here using somewhat different photometric techniques ; our results and those of dpsgb are compared to archival wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) data .",
    "the background of the core radius controversy is given in  2 . in ",
    "3 , the available 47  tuc data sets and the methodologies of this paper and dpsgb are discussed . in ",
    "4 the photometric errors associated with each method are examined , demonstrating that the aperture photometry technique of dpsgb produces a radially - varying bias in the star counts used to measure @xmath21 .",
    "core radius calculations are presented in  5 along with tests which show that the core radius discrepancy can be explained in terms of the star count bias in the dpsgb study .",
    "the conclusions of this paper are presented in  6 .",
    "the first _ hst_-based core radius for 47  tuc was derived from f555w images obtained with the wfpc1 instrument operated in planetary camera mode ( gysb ) : @xmath22 , in good agreement with earlier ground - based measurements ( cf .",
    "shortly thereafter , @xcite analyzed an independent set of pre - refurbishment _ hst _ faint object camera ( foc ) ultraviolet data , and obtained results that were in conflict with previous work .",
    "they pointed out that the cluster center determined from the ground was significantly in error , biased by a few bright giant stars .",
    "more surprisingly , they derived a cluster density profile that did not resemble a king profile , but was instead fit by a superposition of two king profiles with core radii of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , suggesting that 47  tuc is on the verge of core collapse .",
    "the cause of the discrepancy between these density profile measurements remained unclear for the next few years , and so did the true nature of 47  tuc s density profile .",
    "the center derived by @xcite is @xmath23 from the earlier ground - based estimate ( @xcite ) , but only @xmath24 from gysb s estimate which is well within the formal errors .",
    "when calzetti et  al.s foc ultraviolet image - based cluster centroid estimate is used in conjunction with the gysb f555w data set , the resulting density profile is marginally smoother than the profile obtained using gysb s center estimate , possibly indicating that the former center estimate is more accurate ( see  1 ) , but the best - fit core radius is @xmath25 in both cases ( @xcite ) .",
    "two possible sources of discrepancy in density profile measurements are ruled out :    * detailed image simulations show that the sample of faint rgb / subgiant stars used by gysb is nearly complete and , in particular , the degree of incompleteness does not vary appreciably with radius . *",
    "if there were a bluer - inward radial gradient in the mean color of faint rgb / subgiant stars , this would result in a difference between the density profiles derived from ultraviolet versus visual - band images .",
    "however , a star - by - star match between the calzetti et  al .  and",
    "gysb data sets reveals no such ( @xmath26 ) color gradient in 47  tuc .",
    "more recently , dpsgb used an f336w image from the deep wfpc1 data set of @xcite to revise the cluster center derived by @xcite and measure a core radius of @xmath5 , arguing that neither the @xcite composite king profile nor the traditional large core radius fit the data .",
    "this @xmath27 core radius is within a factor of two or three of the range of theoretical estimates for the core radius of a pcc cluster with 47  tuc s @xmath13 .",
    "dpsgb argued that this is suggestive that 47  tuc may be approaching core collapse as @xcite had proposed .",
    "there are two _ hst _ imaging data sets analyzed in this paper : ( * 1 * )  pre - refurbishment wfpc1 data described by @xcite , consisting of a very deep f336w image ( @xmath28s ) with excellent sub - pixel dithering and shorter f439w and f555w exposures ( 160s and 60s , respectively ) ; and ( * 2 * )  archival wfpc2 data from program go-6095 ( pi : s.  g.  djorgovski ) , consisting of f218w ( @xmath29s ) , f439w ( @xmath30s ) , and f555w ( 7s ) images .",
    "the deep wfpc1 data set combines the advantages of ultraviolet imaging ( as used by calzetti et  al .",
    "1993 ) with a wider field of view ( equivalent to that used by gysb ) , and is significantly deeper than all previous 47  tuc data sets .",
    "the great improvement in psf quality in the wfpc2 data set relative to the deep wfpc1 data set more than compensates for the shorter exposure times , resulting in a higher degree of completeness and about a factor of two  smaller photometric errors ( guhathakurta et  al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". moreover , the larger field of view of wfpc2 ( @xmath31 with the pc quadrant being partially filled , extending to @xmath32 ) compared to wfpc1 ( @xmath33 , extending to @xmath34 ) makes it better for density profile measurements .    since this work and dpsgb use the same deep wfpc1 data set",
    ", it is important to examine and compare the stellar photometry techniques used in the two studies .",
    "this paper uses standard psf - fitting photometry techniques based on daophot  ii ( @xcite ) .",
    "these techniques are described in detail in gysb and @xcite , with minor modifications to adapt them to the doubly - oversampled combined f336w wfpc1 image constructed from the sub - pixel dithered exposures ( gilliland et  al .",
    "1995 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the main steps in the technique are outlined here .",
    "a preliminary star list is derived by applying daophot s find routine to the deep wfpc1 f336w image . for each of the four ccds ,",
    "a set of bright , unsaturated , and relatively isolated stars are used to construct a psf template , which is allowed to vary quadratically with position .",
    "this template is then fit to all stars on the image using the preliminary star list .",
    "the neighbors of the psf template stars are subtracted , and the process is iterated a few times .",
    "stars too faint to be detected in the initial find run are then added based on inspection of the psf - subtracted frames .",
    "the process of psf template building and fitting is iterated a few more times , and the final star list is fit .",
    "the magnitudes returned by daophot s psf - fitting routine allstar are converted to total instrumental magnitudes by using the psf template stars to determine a spatially - dependent aperture correction .",
    "the resulting photometry in the f336w , f439w , and f555w bands is converted to the johnson @xmath35 system through an empirical fit to ground - based data from @xcite .",
    "a similar set of techniques is applied to the wfpc2 data set ( cf .  @xcite ) to derive an independent star list for which the instrumental f218w , f439w , and f555w magnitudes are converted to johnson @xmath4 , @xmath36 , and @xmath0 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "dpsgb uses a ` core aperture photometry ' technique defined in @xcite .",
    "psf peaks are identified on the deep wfpc1 f336w image and aperture photometry is carried out using a small aperture comparable to the size of the psf core ( hence the term ` core aperture photometry ' ) and a sky annulus of roughly twice that radius .",
    "an aperture correction factor is applied to convert the resulting aperture magnitudes to total magnitudes , compensating for the portion of the psf that lies outside the aperture and for the fact that the sky annulus includes light from the star in question .",
    "this method is hereafter referred to as aperture photometry .",
    "the sample of @xcite is analyzed using the same aperture photometry technique on the same crowded field . while ",
    "4 makes a specific comparison of our results to dpsgb because they share a common data set , the conclusions are expected to apply to calzetti et  al.s @xmath21 analysis as well .",
    "neighbor contamination affects aperture photometry to a much greater degree than it affects psf - fitting photometry .",
    "since aperture photometry is based on the total flux within the aperture , the contribution of neighboring stars is a direct source of photometric bias .",
    "neighbors have a somewhat smaller effect on the sky measurement since the latter is estimated from the mode .",
    "there are three sets of stellar @xmath4 magnitudes discussed in this study .",
    "the photometry from this work using the deep wfpc1 data set is referred to as @xmath37 ( this paper ) ; the photometry presented by dpsgb based on the same data set is referred to as @xmath38 ( see  [ sbscomp ] ) , where @xmath39 is identical to the quantity @xmath40 in that paper .",
    "photometry from the archival wfpc2 data set is referred to as @xmath41 .",
    "the wfpc2 psf is much sharper than that of wfpc1 , resulting in more accurate photometry ; thus the wfpc2 data set is used to define the ` true ' stellar magnitudes of the stars identified on both the wfpc1 and wfpc2 images . for each star in the wfpc1 and wfpc2 data sets , the positional offset in arcseconds , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( relative to reference star ` e ' in the 47  tuc core ; gysb ) ,",
    "is determined using the iraf task metric ( @xcite ) which uses pointing information based on the _ hst _ guide star catalog .",
    "in order to compare the performance of the two photometric techniques described above , the input star lists used in the two studies are examined .",
    "if , for example , one list systematically misses stars in the crowded central region of the cluster , then this will result in differences in the measured core radii .",
    "the star finding / psf - fitting iterations described above yield a set of 14801 stars identified on the deep wfpc1 f336w image .",
    "a star list kindly provided by guido de marchi gives the positions and magnitudes of 14979 stars from the same image as reduced by dpsgb .",
    "the bright stars in these two star lists match with an rms positional difference of one - third of one pc pixel , @xmath44 .",
    "the entire matched star list contains 12372  stars with positions agreeing to within @xmath45 ( 1  pc pixel ) between the two input star lists .",
    "it should be noted that 141 stars appear twice on the star list from dpsgb .",
    "the majority of the @xmath46 unmatched stars fall below the main sequence turnoff and thus are not used to calculate @xmath21 .",
    "an inspection of the unmatched stars suggests that many such stars from the dpsgb list may be spurious , as they tend to lie in the wings of bright stars , while unmatched stars from this work tend to be faint stars barely visible on the image .",
    "the fraction of evolved stars ( defined to be those with @xmath47 ) that remain unmatched in each sample is quite small : 217 from this paper and 246 from dpsgb out of a total of @xmath48 evolved stars .",
    "comparison of our ( dpsgb s ) wfpc1 photometry to wfpc2 photometry of these unmatched stars indicates that 10% ( 40% ) of the unmatched stars are main sequence stars scattered to brighter magnitudes as a result of photometric error .",
    "as expected , the unmatched stars are such a small fraction of the total that they have a negligible effect on the @xmath21 estimate (  5 ) .",
    "we conclude that the set of stars used in the @xmath21 analysis is basically the same for our study and that of dpsgb ; the sample differences are too small to explain the vastly different conclusions about @xmath21 .",
    "establishing a common photometric system is the next step in comparing the photometry derived from the two data reduction techniques .",
    "this paper converts instrumental magnitudes to standard johnson @xmath35 magnitudes empirically as described in  3 above .",
    "dpsgb uses @xmath49  ( dpsgb ) throughout , referring to instrumental magnitudes `` converted to the wf / pc ground system '' .",
    "a star - by - star comparison between the two data sets indicates that a constant offset of @xmath50  mag applied to @xmath51 ( dpsgb ) brings the majority of stars into good agreement with our measured @xmath4 magnitude .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 will hereafter be used in place of @xmath53 .    to examine the variation of photometric scatter with radius , the wfpc1 magnitude ( @xmath4 or @xmath52 ) of each star",
    "is compared to its ` true ' magnitude , @xmath41 .",
    "the top and bottom panels of fig .",

    "only stars whose ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) positions match to within @xmath56 between the wfpc1 and wfpc2 data sets are used .",
    "the matched wfpc1 sample is divided at the median radius for stars with @xmath47 , @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 ( inner ) subsamples are plotted in the left panels and the @xmath59 ( outer ) subsamples are plotted in the right panels . the small number of points in the outer subsamples results from the limited overlap between the wfpc1 and wfpc2 fields of view away from the core of the cluster .",
    "there are systematic differences between the wfpc1 photometry and the wfpc2 photometry : @xmath4 and @xmath52 are systematically too faint for bright red giants and too bright for main sequence turnoff stars ; these are caused by errors in the conversion to johnson @xmath4 magnitudes for the wfpc1 data set (  [ cmdsec ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4 vs.  @xmath41 scatter is similar for inner and outer samples while the scatter increases dramatically toward smaller radii for @xmath52 vs.  @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , dpsgb s photometry of turnoff stars has a larger scatter than that of this work at all radii .",
    "while the standard deviation and mean value of @xmath60 @xmath61 or @xmath62 $ ] are indicative of the overall rms photometric scatter and mean bias , respectively , it is instructive to examine the full distribution of @xmath60 values .",
    "stars in the interval @xmath63 are used to construct cumulative distributions of @xmath60 .",
    "the cumulative distributions using dpsgb s photometry show a long , asymmetric tail of large @xmath55 , while the distributions using the photometry from this study are quite symmetrical and narrow , implying lower scatter and little or no bias .",
    "more quantitatively , the @xmath60 values corresponding to the 95th percentile of the distribution are : + 0.5 , + 0.5 ( this study : inner and outer subsamples , respectively ) ; + 1.2 , + 0.75 ( dpsgb : inner and outer subsamples , respectively ) .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn from this subsection is that the star lists used in the two studies are effectively identical , but photometric accuracy is not .",
    "dpsgb s photometry shows a systematically greater photometric error , and a bias in the sense that stars are more likely to be measured as brighter than they truly are than fainter .",
    "more importantly , this error and bias are greatest near the cluster center .      color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ; fig .  [ cmd ] )",
    "provide an alternate perspective on the nature of photometric error in the wfpc1 @xmath4-band data set , complementary to the discussion in the previous subsection . as described below",
    ", the cmds also help to highlight a discrepancy between the wfpc1 and wfpc2 @xmath4-band photometric calibration .",
    "the cmds combine @xmath36 and @xmath0 magnitudes , obtained via psf - fitting , with each of the wfpc1 @xmath4 magnitudes under examination : our psf - fitting photometry and dpsgb s aperture photometry .",
    "the @xmath36 vs.  @xmath64 and @xmath36 vs.  @xmath65 cmds ( left and right , respectively ) are presented for stars in the inner and outer halves of the matched star sample ( upper and lower , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath36 vs.  @xmath64 diagrams use @xmath66 , while the @xmath36 vs.  @xmath65 diagrams use @xmath67 . limiting magnitudes",
    "will be discussed in detail in  [ lfsec ] .",
    "the use of the cmd as a diagnostic tool is best illustrated through stars with the most extreme photometric errors .",
    "a plot of @xmath68 vs.  @xmath41 is used to identify ` outliers ' with @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is calculated in running bins of width 0.5  mag in @xmath41 ( open squares in fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) ; the @xmath71 distribution is skewed towards positive values such that very few stars have @xmath72 .",
    "the open squares in @xmath36 vs.  @xmath65 diagrams generally lie on or beyond the blue fringe of the subgiant branch and rgb defined by the rest of the points . by contrast , the vast majority of the open squares in the @xmath36 vs.  @xmath64 diagrams are distributed evenly about the underlying subgiant and red giant branches , with only a few points near the red edge .",
    "this indicates that outliers in the @xmath68 distribution are predominantly the result of the measured @xmath52 value being systematically too bright .",
    "as expected , the greater degree of crowding causes outliers in the inner subsample to display larger deviations in the cmd than those in the outer subsample .",
    "moreover , the width of the rgb appears to be slightly greater in @xmath65 than in @xmath64 .",
    "the solid lines show the median color of stars from the wfpc2 sample in 0.1  mag bins .",
    "the discrepancy between wfpc2 and wfpc1 photometry for both this study and dpsgb is worst for the reddest stars ( bright rgb ) and for the bluest stars ( turnoff ) , and in opposite senses .",
    "this results from error in the johnson @xmath4 calibration for the wfpc1 data set , which has been improved for the wfpc2 data set .",
    "both data sets have been empirically transformed to the johnson system using the ground - based data of aurire et  al .",

    ", we examine the stellar luminosity function of 47  tuc .",
    "this is a key element in understanding the bias in star counts in a magnitude - limited sample that results from photometric error ( scatter and bias ) , and therefore in understanding the difference in core radius estimates between dpsgb and gysb .",

    "the wfpc2 luminosity functions shown in the two panels are identical except for the normalization , and are based on the full star list derived from the entire wfpc2 field of view . since this study relies only on post  main - sequence stars which are _ not _ expected to be affected by mass segregation , we have chosen to combine the entire wfpc2 sample into a single luminosity function ;",

    "the luminosity function derived from this study s wfpc1 photometry has a somewhat more gradual rise from the rgb to the main sequence turnoff than the wfpc2 luminosity function as a result of its larger photometric errors .",
    "the dpsgb luminosity functions , particularly their inner sample , have the most gradual transition between the rgb and turnoff , indicating the largest photometric errors .",

    ", the strongly non - gaussian error distributions make this impractical . instead ,",
    "the cmd diagnostic described in  4.2 clearly demonstrates that there are large photometric errors associated with the @xmath52 photometry but not with @xmath4 , and this conclusion is independent of the accuracy of @xmath41 .",

    "a related question is : how accurate is @xmath41 ?",
    "the luminosity function diagnostic is useful in this regard , despite the mismatches caused by errors in the wfpc1 johnson @xmath4 conversion .",
    "figure  [ lf ] clearly shows that the most prominent features ( e.g. ,  the steep rise at the subgiant branch , the peak at the main sequence turnoff ) are sharpest for wfpc2 photometry , slightly smoothed out by photometric errors for our deep wfpc1 photometry , and even more smoothed out ( larger photometric errors ) in the case of the dpsgb data .",
    "photometric errors associated with the aperture photometry technique result in a significant , radially - varying bias in the star counts ; we hereafter refer to this as `` limiting magnitude bias '' .",
    "the limiting magnitude used by dpsgb is on a steep part of the luminosity function where many stars which are slightly fainter than the limiting magnitude scatter into the sample while relatively few stars scatter out of the sample .",
    "limiting magnitude bias is exacerbated by the asymmetry in the distribution of photometric errors ( photometric bias ; see  4.1 ) and by the fact that the errors ( scatter and bias ) tend to increase towards the fainter magnitudes . since aperture photometry errors increase with stellar crowding towards the cluster center , so does the degree of limiting magnitude bias .",
    "the differential limiting magnitude bias between inner and outer subsamples may be quantified as follows . since the bounding radius of the inner sample , @xmath78 , was chosen to be the median radius of stars in the matched sample with @xmath47 , the inner to outer star count ratio is expected to be unity .",

    "these ratios are greater than unity because errors in the wfpc1 johnson @xmath4 conversion cause the main sequence magnitudes to be systematically too bright (  [ cmdsec ] ; fig .",

    "is used to make maximum likelihood fits to various magnitude - limited samples of evolved stars to determine @xmath21 , while the normalization constant @xmath93 is constrained by the total number of stars in each sample .",
    "calculations are performed using both gysb s estimate of the cluster center : @xmath94 @xmath95 and dpsgb s center estimate : @xmath96 @xmath97 the two center estimates agree to within the quoted uncertainty of @xmath98@xmath99 in each estimate .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all core radius estimates in this paper are based on the gysb center .",
    "table  [ table1 ] contains a summary of the core radius measurements .",
    "the three letters identifying each calculation indicate the source of : ( 1 )  the star list ( d for dpsgb , h for this work , m for the matched sample ) ; ( 2 )  the photometry ( d or h ) ; and ( 3 )  the limiting magnitude ( d or h ) . for direct comparison with dpsgb s @xmath21 measurement , the 141 duplicate stars are included in their star list .",
    "the result of the maximum likelihood fit ( case ddd ) is @xmath100 , in agreement with the dpsgb value of @xmath101 derived using radial binning and a least - squares fit .",
    "a maximum likelihood fit to the evolved star sample from this paper ( case hhh ) gives @xmath102 . applying a limiting magnitude of @xmath103 instead of @xmath67 to dpsgb s star list and photometry results in a core radius of @xmath104 ( case ddh ) .",
    "the change in derived core radius from @xmath105 to @xmath106 is a direct result of the change in limiting magnitude and is independent of whether the 141 duplicate stars are included . using the star list and photometry from this study but choosing dpsgb s limiting magnitude @xmath107 gives @xmath108 ( case hhd ) .",
    "thus , the large scatter / bias in dpsgb s photometry and their increase towards the crowded cluster center , combined with a poor choice of limiting magnitude , are responsible for the spuriously low core radius estimate .",
    "table  [ table1 ] also shows that the measured @xmath21 is independent of whether the star list from this study , dpsgb s star list , or the matched star list is used .",
    "the dependence of the derived @xmath21 on limiting magnitude and photometric technique is roughly the same for all three lists . likewise",
    "the choice of cluster center has little effect on the derived @xmath21 : although core radii based on the dpsgb center tend to be @xmath109 smaller than those based on gysb s center , this difference is less than the uncertainty in an individual measurement .",
    "-2.0truein    [ table1 ]    the wfpc2 data set provides a consistency check on the core radius of 47  tuc .",
    "for all stars derived from the archival wfpc2 data set with @xmath110 , the same maximum likelihood algorithm used above yields @xmath111",
    ". an independent sample of 7044  turnoff stars with @xmath112 drawn from the wfpc2 @xmath0 vs.  @xmath74 cmd ( avoiding potential blend artifacts that may have scattered to brighter magnitudes ) results in @xmath113 . while these turnoff stars are fainter on average than the evolved stars used in earlier density profile studies , they are expected to have roughly the same mass as red giants so that mass segregation effects are unlikely to be important .",
    "a third calculation truncates the @xmath110 sample at @xmath114 as a precaution against inter - ccd edge effects caused by vignetting near the ridges of the pyramid mirror .",
    "a core radius of @xmath115 ( case wfpc2 in table  [ table1 ] ) is derived from this truncated sample .",
    "it is reassuring that these wfpc2 @xmath21 measurements are consistent with gysb , earlier ground - based measurements , and the hhh and mhh calculations above .",
    "figure  [ wfpc2fig ] shows the radial surface density profile of the wfpc2 truncated sample .",
    "also shown are an @xmath116 profile ( solid line ) and an @xmath117 profile ( dashed line ) ; the latter is clearly inconsistent with the data .",
    "these profiles have been normalized to the total observed number of stars in the plot .",
    "figure  [ cumdist ] shows the cumulative radial distributions of the mhh sample ( left panel ) and the truncated wfpc2 sample ( right panel ) .",
    "also shown are profiles for the best fitting core radii ( dotted lines ) and for core radii that differ from the best fit value by @xmath118 ( dashed lines ) .    as an alternative to the maximum likelihood technique , we conduct kolmogorov - smirnov tests between the star count samples and the fitting function in eq .",
    "the mhh sample of 4504  stars ( table  [ table1 ] ) and the truncated wfpc2 sample of 3963  stars are used to construct cumulative radial distributions ( fig .  [ cumdist ] ) .",
    "one - sided kolmogorov - smirnov tests indicate that the mhh data differ from the @xmath119 fitting function by an amount that would be exceeded by chance 26% of the time .",
    "similarly , the truncated wfpc2 data differ from an @xmath120 profile by an amount that would be exceeded by chance 33% of the time .",
    "thus , the functional form adopted here provides an adequate fit to the star count data .    as a final check on the @xmath21 calculations , one can test whether the degree of limiting magnitude bias (  4 ) for a given sample is sufficient to explain the core radius derived for it . using the photometry of dpsgb and their sample of stars with @xmath121 ( case ddd in table  [ table1 ] ) , the inner to outer star count ratio is @xmath122 . integrating a @xmath123 profile ( comparable to the maximum likelihood fit for this sample ) over the area of the wfpc1 field of view predicts an inner to outer ratio of  1.49 consistent with the directly measured star count ratio . on the other hand , integration of the @xmath124 profile",
    "that best fits the star list and psf - fitting photometry used in this paper ( case hhh in table  [ table1 ] ) yields an inner to outer ratio of  1.05 ; this is comparable to the directly measured star count ratio of @xmath125 .",
    "this paper presents estimates of the density profile of the globular cluster 47  tuc based on three samples of stars ( star list and photometry ) derived independently from _ hubble space telescope _",
    "wfpc1 and wfpc2 images .",
    "apparent discrepancies amongst the core radius measurements published by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are investigated .",
    "our conclusion is that there is severe , radially - varying bias in the magnitude - limited star counts used by de  marchi et  al .  and calzetti et  al . , and",
    "this causes their core radius estimates to be spuriously low ( @xmath126 ) relative to other determinations ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "this `` limiting magnitude bias '' is a result of large photometric scatter / bias associated with the application of their aperture photometry method to the crowded central regions of the cluster , coupled with a choice of limiting magnitude near the steep part of the stellar luminosity function . in general , such a choice of limiting magnitude is dangerous ; even with symmetric errors the resulting sample will be contaminated by large numbers of stars just fainter than the cutoff . any radial variation in the magnitude of the errors",
    "will cause the degree of this contamination to vary , resulting in an incorrect determination of the radial density profile .",
    "combining de  marchi et  al.s photometry with a limiting magnitude near the main sequence turnoff at the peak of the luminosity function reduces , but does not eliminate , the discrepancy ( @xmath128 ) ; the radial variations in dpsgb s photometry ( larger photometric scatter / bias at small radii ) have a significant effect on the derived core radius even with an optimal choice of limiting magnitude .",
    "a more accurate psf - fitting method is used in this paper to indepedently derive two sets of stellar photometry , one from the deep wfpc1 data analyzed by de  marchi et  al .  and the other from an archival wfpc2 data set .",
    "the core radii derived using these two photometry sets are independent of the choice of limiting magnitude and star list , and are consistent with each other and with previous ground - based and _ hst _ work : @xmath129 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; guhathakurta et  al .",
    "1992 ) .    the best fit core radius for the surface density distribution of evolved stars in 47  tuc is about 15% of the cluster half - mass radius ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "this is significantly larger than the range of @xmath131 values found in numerical simulations of post  core - collapse clusters : 0.010.04 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted however that the surface brightness profile is not a perfect discriminant between a relaxed and post  core - collapse cluster , and it is advisable to combine it with velocity dispersion data ( gebhardt & fischer 1995 ) .",
    "we are grateful to guido de  marchi for making stellar photometry tables available to us in electronic form , and to randi cohen for help in the early phase of this project .",
    "we would like to thank fernando camilo , paulo freire , karl gebhardt , and fred rasio for helpful discussions , and the referees , especially tad pryor , for several useful suggestions .",
