    "interaction between atoms and photons has been a fundamental issue since the early days of quantum mechanics , and it continues to be a central topic expecially in connection with controlled manipulation of small numbers of photons and atoms at the quantum level @xcite . in this framework , emphasis has been put recently on repeated measurements on atoms and photons in a quantum regime requiring that the measurement process be explicitly taken into account .",
    "it is often desirable that the outcome of a measurement is not influenced by the previous ones , which has been found to be possible by a clever choice of the measured and measuring systems .",
    "indeed , a class of measurements aimed at repeatedly monitoring the same observable has been introduced and shown to be compatible with the foundations of quantum mechanics , the so - called quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements @xcite .",
    "many qnd schemes have been proposed , and some of them have been implemented , to monitor various measurable quantities , _",
    "e.g. _ displacements of macroscopic oscillators below the standard quantum limit @xcite , photon number in traveling @xcite or standing @xcite electromagnetic fields , magnetic flux in superconducting interference devices @xcite , vibrational energy of an atom confined in a paul trap @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the problem of incorporating quantum nondemolition measurements within the language of modern quantum measurement theory was not addressed specifically , to our knowledge , although important steps were taken in @xcite . in this article , we analyze a model for qnd measurements based on lindblad formalism , specializing it to measurement strategies aimed at describing continuous quantum nondemolition counting of photons confined in a cavity or atoms interrogated to be in a certain internal state .",
    "the system is described by a density matrix with an evolution equation introduced for generic open quantum systems @xcite and already applied to other , demolitive measurement schemes such as the ones involving the quantum zeno effect in hyperfine atomic spectroscopy @xcite , optogravitational cavities @xcite , superconducting circuits @xcite , and trapped ions @xcite . in both cases",
    "the evolution of the coherence of the monitored system is studied , providing a simple picture of its decay during continuous qnd measurements . even starting from factorized states for atoms and photons",
    ", the measurement originates an entanglement that is ultimately responsible for the indirect decoherence of the observed system through the continuous collapse of the state of the probe .",
    "the implications of the model are discussed in connection to recent experiments implementing nondemolitive counting of photons in cavity qed @xcite and atoms confined in electromagnetic traps @xcite .",
    "* a. general formalism *    in this section we recall some useful concepts related to quantum nondemolition measurements , referring the reader to @xcite for a more detailed account .",
    "although some measurements may occur through direct observation of the same observable under study , qnd measurements are the most important example of indirect measurements , whereby the interaction of the system @xmath0 with another system @xmath1 is required .",
    "the dynamics of the monitored observable @xmath2 of the system @xmath0 is inferred through the modifications induced on the actually measured observable @xmath3 of the probe .",
    "the total hamiltonian operator is written as @xmath4 and the evolution of the overall system is described by the density matrix equation @xmath5\\;. \\label{rho}\\ ] ] the key idea behind a qnd measurement is that the subdynamics of the observable @xmath2 of the monitored system , albeit influencing the evolution of the probe , is not affected by this last .",
    "this nonreciprocity is obtained if the interaction hamiltonian @xmath6 depends on @xmath2 but does not commute with @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath7=0     \\ ; , \\hspace{1 cm }     [ \\hat{a}_p , \\hat{h}_{int}]\\neq 0\\;.\\ ] ] the subdynamics for the observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 are then ruled , in the heisenberg picture , by the equations : @xmath8 \\ ; , \\hspace{1 cm } i\\hbar { d \\hat{a}_p \\over dt}=[\\hat{h}_p+\\hat{h}_{int } , \\hat{a}_p]\\;.\\ ] ] in addition , the observable @xmath2 should be protected against the evolution of all the other system observables whose subdynamics is instead unpredictably affected by the measurement , in compliance with the heisenberg principle .",
    "this requirement restricts the class of the observables that may be monitored in a qnd way , a further sufficient condition being that the observable is a constant of the motion in the absence of interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath9=0 $ ] .",
    "this description is still not a measurement model . in particular , the unitary evolution ( [ rho ] ) is in contrast with the general expectation that a measurement process should introduce irreversible signatures into the evolution of the system .",
    "actually , the interaction whereby the system @xmath0 is monitored by the probe @xmath1 does not define alone a measurement process . as a next step the observable @xmath3 has to be registered and , in order a measurement is defined univocally , this should correspond to a deterministic , classical , amount of information .",
    "it is the irreversibility implied by this act , with the pointer choosing only one of the many possible quantum alternatives , that can not be accounted for within the closed dynamics discussed so far . at the beginning of quantum theory , this problem was solved by introducing a postulate , which in the von neumann form states the instantaneous collapse of the wavefunction on the eigenstate corresponding to the observed eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "this approach , although applied even in recent times to various situations ( including the cavity qed case as in @xcite ) , has been overcome by a different description where a unified dynamics for quantum systems is built , without additional postulates , using the theory of open quantum systems . in this framework , the irreversible nature of the measurement is recovered by imagining the act of reading the outcome as due to an external environment which continuously interacts with the observed system . from a physical viewpoint",
    ", any process in which the interrogations on the observed system are made at a repetition rate larger than its intrinsic characteristic frequencies may be schematized as a continuous measurement . by restricting to so - called _ nonselective _ ensemble evolutions that can be represented in terms of a density operator ,",
    "the most general dynamical law preserving ( complete ) positivity and normalization of the density operator was derived for a system in interaction with a markovian environment in the form of a so - called lindblad master equation @xcite , later successfully exploited in modeling quantum optics experiments @xcite .",
    "decoherence is introduced into this picture of open system evolutions as the dynamical quenching of the off - diagonal density matrix elements , a key property first used to explain the absence of superposition states in a measurement apparatus in @xcite . within this perspective ,",
    "measured systems are nothing but a special class of open quantum systems , the environment being represented by the many - mode field of the macroscopic measuring apparatus and the measurement process being equivalent to repeated instantaneous effect - valued measurements @xcite , or decoherentization kicks given to the density matrix .",
    "we are thus led to the following master equation for the density of the coupled @xmath10 system undergoing a measurement through @xmath3 : @xmath11   - { \\kappa\\over2 } \\left [ \\hat{a}_p , [ \\hat{a}_p , \\hat{\\rho}(t ) ] \\right]\\;.   \\label{rhok}\\ ] ] the probe observable , @xmath3 , plays the role of a lindblad operator representing the influence of the external environment and the parameter @xmath12 , with dimensions @xmath13=[t^{-1 } a^{-2}]$ ] , gives the coupling ( generally time - dependent ) of the probe to the measurement apparatus . by choosing a continuous function of time @xmath14",
    "a continuous measurement process is obtained .",
    "* b. atom - photon hamiltonian *    in the following , we will discuss quantum nondemolition counting schemes for both photons confined in a cavity and two - level atoms in a given eigenstate . by denoting with @xmath15 the standard annihilation and creation bosonic operators ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the free single - mode electromagnetic field is written as @xmath16 while the two - level hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath17 with respect to the basis of the energy eigenstates @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "it is convenient to shift the zero of energy in order to have @xmath20 , which is equivalent to choose the following shifted two - level hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the pauli displacement operators and the projector over the excited state @xmath24 respectively .",
    "based on the previous considerations , we choose an interaction hamiltonian which is linear in both the photon number operator @xmath25 and the atomic projector @xmath26 , @xmath27 the coefficient @xmath28 , a measurement angular frequency , quantifying the strength of the quantum nondemolition coupling .",
    "the occupation probability of level @xmath24 for an atom in a generic state @xmath29 is @xmath30 .",
    "we note that , provided the hamiltonian ( [ hami ] ) is reinterpreted as single - particle operator for an ensemble of independent atoms and collective effects due to quantum statistics or interatomic forces are neglected , the probability @xmath31 is related directly to the average number @xmath32 of atoms in level @xmath33 through @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the total number of atoms . once chosen as system observable @xmath2",
    ", both the photon number operator and the atomic occupation probability automatically satisfy the commutation relationship with the respective hamiltonians ( [ ham ] ) , ( [ hami ] ) since , in the absence of interactions , they are conserved .",
    "the total hamiltonian to be used in ( [ rhok ] ) is written explicitly as @xmath36 we will be working in the representation of the unperturbed ( field + atom ) eigenstates , expanding the density operator as @xmath37 .",
    "it may be worth to look , for a moment , at the closed evolution of the density matrix elements . by projecting eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) ( or eq .",
    "( [ rhok ] ) with @xmath38 ) , we find @xmath39\\rho_{fn , em } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose solutions are simply rotations of the initial density matrix elements : @xmath40}\\rho_{fn , fm}(0 ) , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "these equations imply obviously that both the average photon number and the average occupation probabilities of level @xmath42 are time - independent , consistent with the qnd nature of the interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the photon - atom interaction induces additional phase - shifts in the density matrix , which are proportional to the strength of the coupling @xmath43 and depend upon the atomic and the photonic state .",
    "these phase - shifts contain the useful information about the system that needs to be extracted through the measurement on the probe . in the following two sections",
    ", we will examine two complementary measurement procedures based on this optoatomic coupling .",
    "a first class of qnd measurements in optoatomic systems is obtained by monitoring the photon field using nonresonant atoms as the probe system .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath44 accordingly , the hamiltonian ( [ totham ] ) represents the fact that the photons in the cavity induce a state - dependent dynamical stark effect on the atom and a selective phase - shift of the atomic wavefunction . due to the requirement of non - commutativity between the probe observable and the interaction hamiltonian",
    ", we discard any operator proportional to the pauli matrix @xmath45 as atomic probe operator @xmath3 . on the other hand , in order to model a measurement which is sensitive to the dephasing accumulated between the components @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the atom interacting with the mode , phase - sensitive observables like the quadrature components of the atomic dipole operator @xmath48 , are natural candidates .",
    "indeed , we observe that for a proper atomic superposition state , @xmath49 , the average value @xmath50 is nonzero whenever a relative phase @xmath51 is present . by comparison , @xmath52 ,",
    "maintaining finite values even if the relative phase vanishes .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath53 as the probe observable and by using eq.([rhok ] ) we get the following equations of motion : @xmath54   \\rho_{fn , em}-{\\kappa \\over 4 } ( \\rho_{fn , em}+\\rho_{en , fm } ) , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the evolutions for atomic diagonal and non - diagonal entries are decoupled but , at variance with the situations analyzed in @xcite , the measurement affects all components .    by introducing the two families of pseudofrequencies",

    "pseudofrequencies @xmath56 , @xmath57 tend to become purely imaginary , introducing overdamped oscillations and thereby decoherence .",
    "the time development of the electromagnetic field under the effect of the measurement can be inspected by evaluating the reduced density matrix : @xmath63   \\rho_{ff}^{(atom)}(0 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\big[\\cos ut+\\big(-i(n - m ) \\gamma + { \\kappa \\over 4}\\big )   { \\sin ut \\over u}\\big ] \\rho_{ee}^{(atom)}(0)\\bigg\\}\\rho_{nm}^{(field)}(0 ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where an initially uncorrelated state @xmath64 has been assumed .",
    "it is immediate to recognize that , for every @xmath12 , field populations are unaffected by the measurement , i.e. @xmath65 , in agreement with the qnd nature of the coupling .",
    "however , the process of acquiring information on the field photon number can not be realized without a back - action on the conjugate field variable , specifically an unavoidable degradation of the field phase distribution . a direct visualization of the phase evolution is provided by suitable phase - coherence indicators .",
    "we adopt here the formalism of the so - called pegg - barnett phase distribution discussed at length in @xcite : @xmath66 we have analyzed in detail the evolution arising when the field is initially in a coherent state @xmath67 with a mean photon number @xmath68 and the probe state is an equal superposition of levels @xmath46,@xmath47 .",
    "as it will become clear in section v , these choices will enable us a straightforward comparison with the results reported in @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that equivalent physical insight would be gained from using a different standard quantum - optical distribution , the so - called @xmath69-function @xcite . starting as a sharply peaked function centered at @xmath70 , the pegg - barnett distribution retains its form when @xmath71 , the only changes reflecting the rotation of the coherent state in phase - space . when @xmath72 but @xmath38 the phase distribution is split into two components moving at different velocities with relative weights proportional to the coefficients of the atomic wavefunction .",
    "the evolution is strikingly different in the presence of measurement , since the phase distribution is progressively scrambled until it becomes completely flat when field coherences are asymptotically destroyed , @xmath73 .",
    "the probability distribution ( [ barnett ] ) is shown in fig . 1 for various instants of time and two different values of @xmath12 corresponding to small and strong coupling with the environment .",
    "in the case of weak coupling ( solid line ) , the splitting of the initial , well - defined phase distribution , into two components traveling with different velocities is still recognizable .",
    "a second class of qnd measurements is obtained if , according to the notations of section iia , we choose @xmath74 this corresponds to monitoring the atomic level via an electromagnetic field and is realized ordinarily by means of an absorption process , i.e. by sending photons resonantly tuned at an energy - level gap .",
    "this technique is manifestly demolitive for the interrogated atoms .",
    "an alternative approach consists in the detection of the phase - shift originated by the atom through a non - resonant interaction with a light beam , the atomic sample acting as a dispersive medium with a complex refraction index .",
    "a nice application of this technique has been recently reported in @xcite , where repeated , nondestructive optical imaging of an atomic cloud confined in a magnetic trap has been demonstrated .",
    "the modification of the refraction index , proportional to the atomic optical density , induces a phase - shift of the probe field which is manifested in turn as a change in the amplitude of its quadrature component .",
    "the dispersive phase - shifts may be also detected through amplitude modulation by means of classical , standard techniques like dark - ground or phase - contrast imaging @xcite . in our model , it is natural to choose the following phase - sensitive photon operator , @xmath75 as a probe observable .",
    "this choice , in addition to fulfilling the qnd criteria established above , corresponds to a measurement configuration which is the dual of the one analyzed in section iv . by exploiting the master equation ( [ rhok ] ) again , and by evaluating the new lindblad commutator , equations of motion of the following form",
    "are derived : @xmath76 , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and @xmath79 indicates for brevity the appropriate unmeasured contribution , shown explicitly in eqs .",
    "( [ unmeas ] ) . since , as before , the probe observable @xmath3 is diagonal in the system variables , no transitions are induced by the measurement process in the system . in this case , the @xmath46 and @xmath47 components evolve independently , but a quite complicated structure of the couplings in the fock space of the photons is present in general .",
    "( [ measphot ] ) have been integrated numerically for a field coherent state and an equal - weight atomic superposition state .",
    "the reduced density matrix that is appropriate to study the evolution of the signal mode during the measurement is the atomic density obtained by tracing the total density matrix over the photonic degrees of freedom , @xmath80 by analogy with the previous case , we expect that although no perturbation is introduced on the variable which is qnd - monitored , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath81 , atomic coherence is eroded due to back - action . in fig .",
    "2 the time dependence of the coherence indicator @xmath82 is plotted for different values of the coupling parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the evolution of atomic coherence in the closed case @xmath38 can be evaluated explicitly for a coherent probe state since , from eqs .",
    "( [ unmeas ] ) , @xmath83 this shows that the quantity @xmath84 oscillates with angular frequency @xmath28 between a maximum value equal to @xmath85 and a strictly positive minimum equal to @xmath86 , leading to an example of nontrivial reversible dynamics of the modulus of the atomic coherence . in the presence of measurement ,",
    "atomic coherence damps exponentially to zero with a rate proportional to the parameter @xmath12 , still preserving the oscillatory behaviour visible in fig .",
    "the model developed here , describing decoherence induced by a continuous qnd measurement , is characterized completely by the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath12 . in this section",
    "we discuss to what extent these parameters can be related to a realistic experimental scheme .",
    "the example we take is the scheme proposed and implemented by a group at the ecole normale suprieure @xcite , where atoms detect in a nondemolitive way the photons stored in a high - q cavity . in their scheme , the atom is schematized as a system with three rydberg levels @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath87 , with levels @xmath87 and @xmath47 of the same parity , opposite to the one of level @xmath46 .",
    "the frequency @xmath88 of the cavity mode is detuned from the @xmath89 transition by an amount @xmath90 .",
    "the detuning is large enough to neglect photon absorption , but small in comparison to the angular frequency @xmath91 .",
    "the presence of photons in the cavity results in a phase - shift of the @xmath46-state relative to the @xmath47-state .",
    "we recall that the dynamical frequency shift induced on an atom in level @xmath46 and atomic dipole @xmath92 and located at point @xmath93 in a cavity containing @xmath94 photons is @xmath95}^{1/2 } -1 \\bigg\\ } \\simeq   { e(r)^2 d^2 \\over { \\hbar^2 \\delta}}n=   { \\omega(r)^2 \\over \\delta } n\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the electric field at @xmath93 and the last approximation holds if absorption processes are made negligible .",
    "the phase - shift is proportional to the vacuum rabi angular frequency @xmath97 . noticing that @xmath94 is the eigenvalue of the @xmath98 operator",
    ", we can think of the spatially averaged phase - shift as due to the effective hamiltonian @xmath99 the parameter @xmath43 of our model is therefore identified as @xmath100 . concerning the parameter @xmath12 , the discussion is more elaborated , since in the realistic situation analyzed in @xcite the measuring meter is actually a beam of two - level atoms crossing the cavity and the effect of the measurement is taken into account using the von neumann collapse for each atomic interaction .",
    "distinction is made between two different configurations of the probe system , corresponding to either atoms with a known initial velocity that are registered by the field ionization counters , or atoms which are not in a monokinetic velocity state and are not read . in the language of quantum measurement theory ,",
    "this difference can be restated in terms of _ selective _ and _ nonselective _ measurements @xcite , nonselective dynamics being obtained by averaging over all the possible states of the probe , in this case over the velocity distribution measurements and the two possible outcomes of the internal level . to make explicit comparison with @xcite",
    ", it has been shown there that the selective evolution of the field density matrix at the @xmath101 atomic detection event is given by : @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the amplitude of the component @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) corresponding to a generic atomic velocity @xmath106 and a photon number @xmath107 . as first step towards nonselective measurements ,",
    "we need to evaluate the weighted average over the possible final outcome of the probe , leading to : @xmath108 where the parameter @xmath109 measures the accumulated phase - shift per photon and @xmath110 is the atomic velocity corresponding to a @xmath111 pulse in the ramsey zone used for interferometric detection of the dephasing . the next step is a second integration over the atomic velocity distribution @xmath112 : @xmath113 in figs . 3 and 4",
    "the pegg - barnett phase distribution is plotted for a monokinetic atomic beam , ( eq .",
    "( [ semisel ] ) ) and a thermal atomic beam , ( eq .",
    "( [ nonsel ] ) ) , respectively .",
    "while in both situations the phase distribution is broadened and tends towards a flat one , only in the second case the transient does resemble the behaviour found for a nonselective measurement by using the effective lindblad approach , cfr .",
    "1 . in particular",
    ", the velocity of decoherence is proportional to the temperature of the atomic beam , i.e. the beam variance .",
    "this qualitatively agrees with the result established in @xcite , concerning the direct proportionality between the measurement coupling constant and the temperature of the bath in which the meter is embedded @xcite . unlike the parameter @xmath43 ,",
    "it is not possible to infer a simple relationship relating @xmath12 to the various parameters of the realistic configuration .",
    "this shows advantages and disanvantages of the effective lindblad approach : it is often impossible to relate it completely with the experimental set - up ; however , a general description of any measurement process is obtained without a detailed knowledge of the actual experimental procedure .",
    "for this reason , the formalism may be easily adapted to the description of other relevant schemes , like the single photon - atom coupling in a high - finesse fabry - perot cavity @xcite , the qnd counting of atoms in an optogravitational cavity based upon use of evanescent fields @xcite , and the nondestructive imaging of a bose - einstein atomic condensate @xcite . for the latter system ,",
    "the dephasing of the atomic coherence induced by the measurement process should generate damping of the oscillatory behaviour of either a two - species condensate exhibiting rabi - like oscillations or two single - component condensates spatially separated and undergoing coherent , josephson - like oscillations , a situation similar to the one involving a superconducting circuit already analyzed in @xcite .",
    "a model for the description of the decay of coherence in continuous quantum nondemolition measurements involving photons and atoms has been developed and applied to photon and atom counting .",
    "even if initially uncorrelated , atoms and photons become entangled during the measurement and , although conserving their number , they are subjected to decoherence due to the back - action via the probe .",
    "the dynamics of the system has been analytically solved in the case of photon counting via atomic detection .",
    "the decay of atomic coherence has been evidenced when the atomic occupation probability is measured through the monitoring of the light beam .",
    "contact has been established with actual experiments in which decoherence induced by the measurement process is or could be observable . in particular , the nondestructive monitoring of bose - einstein condensates of atomic dilute gas through dispersive imaging , demonstrated in @xcite , will deserve a particular attention , since the influence of the measurement on the dynamics of the phase of the wavefunction is a crucial issue in the study of macroscopic quantum coherence .",
    "more in general , this model gives constraints on the minimum rate at which coherence is progressively destroyed during a continuous measurement process even if a quantum nondemolition monitoring is adopted , provided that all other possible sources of decoherence have been quenched by proper technological improvements . as a consequence , similar considerations should be also relevant to investigate decoherence dynamics within qed - based quantum computation proposals @xcite or quantum control strategies involving qnd - mediated feedback @xcite .",
    "finally , we point out that in the model described here emphasis has been put on considering the whole coupled ( system+probe ) object as an open quantum system in interaction with a measuring environment , the probe degrees of freedom being traced out on the total density matrix and not dynamically eliminated from the beginning .",
    "this makes the description formally different from other existing approaches @xcite .",
