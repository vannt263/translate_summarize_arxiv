    "today it is widely accepted that dark matter is a fundamental component of the universe , which plays a key role in the processes of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "cosmological @xmath6-body simulations accurately predict the evolution of the dark component and its actual spatial distribution @xcite . in the @xmath5 cold dark matter ( @xmath5cdm )",
    "cosmology , spiral galaxies accrete smaller building blocks into both their spheroidal component and their stellar disk .",
    "the presence of an old thick disk , very common among spiral galaxies @xcite , is often considered the product of one or more merging events ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . @xcite",
    "first proposed that , as satellites are torn apart by tidal forces , they should deposit their dark matter into a flat dark structure .",
    "this idea was recently explored by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter re08 ) , who showed that the presence of a dark disk is a natural expectation of the @xmath5cdm model . as a result of their simulations",
    ", they proposed that a galaxy such as the milky way should host a relatively thin dark feature ( exponential scale height 2.1 - 2.4  kpc ) , with a local density at the solar position ( @xmath7 ) 0.25 - 1.0 times that of the dark halo ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the proposed dark component is much more flattened than the dark halo , but it is still noticeably thicker than any visible disk , because the scale height of the galactic old thick stellar disk is @xmath90.9 kpc , while younger stars and interstellar medium ( ism ) form even thinner structures ( 0.3 and 0.1 kpc , respectively , * ? ? ?",
    "in the last year it became progressively accepted that , if the @xmath5cdm cosmology is the correct model , dark disks should be ubiquitous in spiral galaxies . more recently ,",
    "* hereafter pu09 ) , elaborated new models , proposing a thicker ( scale height 4.6  kpc ) but less dense dark disk in the milky way ( @xmath7/@xmath100.30 ) .",
    "the presence of the dark disk is strongly related to the formation of the stellar thick disk .",
    "however , its merging origin is currently under debate , because of the difficulties of the models in reproducing all its properties .",
    "for example , @xcite argued that thick disk formation through turbulent and clumpy phases at high redshift can explain its lack of flaring @xcite , at variance with the merger scenario .",
    "this model would not necessarily require the presence of a dark disk .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of a phantom disk is also an expectation of mond theory @xcite , where the departure of gravitation from newtonian law should cause the detection of an additional amount of disk matter @xcite .",
    "it is thus clear that the milky way dark disk has become a benchmark for many theories , from gravitational law to cosmological galaxy formation , and thick disk origin .",
    "we are performing an extensive survey to study the kinematical and chemical vertical structure of the galactic thick disk @xcite .",
    "preliminary results were presented by @xcite . in this letter",
    "we analyze the vertical trend of the surface mass density as inferred by thick disk kinematics , in search of evidence for any dark component .",
    "the detailed analysis of the kinematical results will be published in a later paper ( c. moni bidin et al .",
    "2011a , in preparation , hereafter paper  i ) , and the full study of the hypothesis and equations presented here will follow ( c. moni bidin et al . 2011b , in preparation , hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "our investigation is based on a sample of @xmath91200 red giants defined by @xcite , vertically distributed with respect to the galactic plane in a cone of 15 degrees radius centered on the south galactic pole .",
    "all objects have two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) photometry @xcite and absolute proper motions from the spm3 catalog @xcite . the sample was selected by applying a color cut in the infrared color - magnitude diagram , to isolate intermediate - metallicity thick disk stars .",
    "main - sequence ( ms ) dwarfs were excluded both by a sloped cut at fainter magnitudes , which excludes all but the nearest ( @xmath1163  pc ) dwarfs , and by conservative kinematical criteria imposing a stellar velocity lower than the local escape velocity ( 550 km s@xmath12 ; see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "we collected high - resolution echelle spectra for two - thirds of the girard et al.s sample , during 38 nights at la silla and las campanas observatories .",
    "the distribution of proper motions and colors of this sub - sample was analyzed , to ensure that no selection effect was introduced .",
    "we visually inspected all the spectra and excluded the residual low - metallicity stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath131.5 ) , most probably halo contaminators , and misclassified dwarfs .",
    "radial velocities ( rvs ) were measured for all the stars with a typical error of 0.5 - 0.7 km s@xmath12 , cross - correlating each spectrum with standard stars observed during the same runs @xcite .",
    "distances were estimated with a color - absolute magnitude relation calibrated on the red giant branch of 47tuc , whose stellar population is very similar to the intermediate - metallicity galactic thick disk @xcite .",
    "finally , the three velocity components in the galactic cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath14 ) , and their associated errors , were calculated for each star from its proper motion , rv , and distance , and the uncertainties on these quantities .",
    "the error in distance was @xmath15% @xcite , while the error in proper motions was fixed to 3 mas yr@xmath12 ( t. m. girard , 2009 , private communication , see also * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the mean errors in ( u , v , w ) thus increased from @xmath9(7,36,38 ) km s@xmath12 at @xmath1=2 kpc , to @xmath9(10,61,66 ) km s@xmath12 at 4 kpc .",
    "the details of observations , data reduction , and rv measurements were presented by @xcite , and they will be fully discussed in paper  i.    in this letter , we restrict our analysis to the @xmath9300 stars beyond 2  kpc from the galactic plane , to avoid contamination by the thin disk .",
    "we considered only stars with @xmath16150 , @xmath17300 , and @xmath18300 km s@xmath12 , to exclude halo stars and/or bad measurements .",
    "we did not apply a cut in velocity errors , because it systematically excludes high - velocity stars , biasing the results : the propagation of the uncertainty in distance in fact introduces a term proportional to the velocities themselves .",
    "the sample was binned with respect to distance from the galactic plane @xmath1 , following three different criteria : three large bins of 85 stars each , five bins of 50 , and five of 45 stars .",
    "the dispersion in the three velocity components was calculated in each bin , fitting the corresponding probability plot with a linear relation ( @xcite ; see also @xcite , for an application to a very similar astrophysical case ) . in the nearest bins ( @xmath192.3  kpc )",
    "the fit was performed outside the @xmath20 range , to avoid the residual thin disk contamination ( 5%-10% according to our estimates ) . at increasing distance",
    "an overestimate was a serious possibility because of some outliers , most probably stars with an incorrect distance and/or proper motion .",
    "we consequently excluded from the fit the points on the wings of the distribution showing clear deviation from linearity , i.e. outliers departing from the underlying normal distribution .",
    "the mean error in each bin was quadratically subtracted to derive the final estimate of the dispersion .",
    "finally , the dispersion in each velocity component was plotted against the average @xmath1 of the bin , and a least - squares linear relation was fitted to derive the vertical trend of dispersions .",
    "the results were very similar in the three binning criteria : differences on the derived quantities were smaller than 1.5@xmath21 , and in most cases agreed within 1@xmath21 .",
    "we therefore gathered the information of all the bins together , fitting a final plot comprising 13 points .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ f_dispersions ] .",
    "we derive a small vertical gradient of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 of 6.2@xmath23.7 , 4.5@xmath21.9 , and 2.8@xmath20.5 km s@xmath12 kpc@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the least square solution was assumed as the error on the linear profile parameters .",
    "these could be underestimated because of the correlation of the fitted points , but they are only about 30% higher when fitting the uncorrelated bins of 50 stars , and this has only minimal impact on the final results , because the uncertainties on the thick disk parameters dominate the error budget .    around @xmath1=2.5",
    "kpc we find a sudden deviation from linearity of the cross - term of the dispersion matrix , @xmath25 .",
    "this feature could be due to a stellar sub - structure , such as a comoving group of stars .",
    "the use of only 13 bins is inadequate to reveal the general trend , hence we binned the data in overlapping groups of 50 stars at steps of 2 stars , as shown in figure  [ f_uw ] .",
    "we finally derived the linear relation required for our calculations excluding the  depression \" at 2.5  kpc .",
    "the line is a good fit outside this feature .",
    "our formulation is based on the following assumptions :    1 .   _",
    "steady state_. the thick disk is in equilibrium with the galactic potential , as expected for an old stellar population .",
    "therefore , all temporal derivatives are set to zero .",
    "[ hypo_steady ] 2 .",
    "_ locally flat rotation curve_. the rotation curve is assumed flat at the solar galactocentric distance .",
    "3 .   _ no net radial or vertical stellar flux_. the mean radial and vertical velocity components are zero , while the rotational component shows a non - null lag @xcite .",
    "exponential radial dispersion profiles_. all the velocity dispersions decrease with @xmath26 following an exponential law , with a scale length h@xmath27 equal to the one observed for the mass density ( h@xmath28 ) .",
    "[ hypo_expo ] 5 .",
    "_ vertical constancy of scale lengths_. h@xmath28 and h@xmath27 do not depend on @xmath1 at the solar position .",
    "this is observationally verified for the mass density @xcite , and it is assumed valid for the velocity dispersions , because their radial behavior is linked to the mass distribution by assumption ( [ hypo_expo ] ) .",
    ".   _ null cross term on the galactic plane_. @xmath29=0 .",
    "this hypothesis is required for symmetry reasons ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is observationally confirmed by @xcite .",
    "[ hypo_uw ]    the hypothesis ( [ hypo_expo ] ) is observationally confirmed for @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "its extension to the other components relies on the controversial assumption of constant anisotropy , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "we have no information about the radial trend of the velocity dispersions , but this assumption is supported by observations @xcite , and numerical simulations for @xmath319  kpc @xcite .    integrating the poisson equation from @xmath32 to @xmath1 , assuming that the vertical component of the force f@xmath33 is null on the plane , we obtain : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the surface mass density between @xmath36 , and f@xmath37 is the radial component of the force . inserting the jeans equations in equation  ( [ eq_pois ] ) , making use of our hypotheses ( [ hypo_steady])-([hypo_uw ] ) , and calculating simple derivatives and integrals",
    ", we eventually obtain the final expression : @xmath38 } \\label{eq_final},\\ ] ] where h@xmath39 is the thick disk exponential scale height , and : @xmath40 to calculate the surface density we must insert into equation  ( [ eq_final ] ) the vertical trends of the kinematical quantities @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , plus the three parameters r@xmath41 , h@xmath39 , and h@xmath28 .",
    "we fixed r@xmath41=8.0@xmath20.3  kpc , and we defined the thick disk scale height and length as the mean of about 20 literature estimates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and paper  ii for the bibliographical references ) , obtaining h@xmath28=3.8@xmath20.2  kpc and h@xmath39=0.90@xmath20.08  kpc .",
    "the quoted errors are given by the error on the mean , that should be the most appropriate statistic when averaging many uncorrelated measurements .",
    "however , they could be too small because of the traditional uncertainty on these parameters , although the estimates converged considerably in the last years .",
    "we therefore also considered an uncertainty of 0.4 and 0.12 kpc , respectively , comprising all the measurements of the last decade within @xmath42 ( @xmath970% within @xmath43 ) .",
    "these larger errors necessarily decrease the significance of the results , but without altering the general conclusions , as can be deduced from figure  [ f_darkdisk ] .",
    "the error on @xmath35 was calculated from the propagation of errors of all the quantities in equation  ( [ eq_final ] ) .    in deriving equation  ( [ eq_final ] )",
    ", we assumed the kinematical quantities as symmetric with respect to the plane , so that their integrals between @xmath32 and @xmath1 are twice the product of integration between 0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is easily justified for the dispersions , but it may not be the case for @xmath25 .",
    "we therefore also considered an antisymmetric cross - term , where the third term of equation  ( [ eq_final ] ) vanishes . as shown in figure  [ f_results ] , a symmetric cross - term fails to return physically meaningful results , because it violates two minimum requirements : the surface density must at least account for the known visible matter , and it can not decrease with @xmath1",
    ". we will therefore assume the cross - term as antisymmetric , and consider only the results obtained under this hypothesis hereafter .",
    "our results are shown in figure  [ f_results ] .",
    "we find @xmath0(2  kpc)=57.6@xmath25.8 @xmath3 pc@xmath4 , and the curve is nearly flat in the whole range , while the error increases constantly to @xmath912 @xmath3 pc@xmath4 at 4  kpc .",
    "the solution increases 1  @xmath3 pc@xmath4 between 2 and 3.2  kpc , then it turns slightly downwards .",
    "however , the decrease is so small ( 0.55 @xmath3 pc@xmath4 ) that a small refinement of any parameter would correct it , for example increasing h@xmath28 by 0.1  kpc .",
    "moreover , this problem is present only in the lower half of the family of solutions defined by the @xmath43 strip .",
    "we did not alter the input parameters to amend it , because this would add a high degree of arbitrariness to the results .",
    "in figure  [ f_results ] we overplot a model of surface mass density due to the visible mass .",
    "the thin and thick disk exponential scale heights , the halo shape , and the local thick disk and halo normalization were taken from @xcite .",
    "we included a thin layer ( 100 pc ) of ism contributing 13 @xmath3 pc@xmath4 @xcite , and the thin disk density on the plane was normalized by the requirement @xmath44(1.1  kpc)=40 @xmath3 pc@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this quantity includes all disk stellar components and remnants , and it is currently the best estimate often assumed in galactic mass models @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the visible mass and our dynamical solution is striking , and there is no need to invoke any dark component . in figure  [ f_results ]",
    "we also plot a model including a dark halo @xcite .",
    "the curve is completely incompatible with our results , both for its high value and steep slope .",
    "one can argue that we are actually deducing the mass from the change in the gravitation potential : the dark halo could be too uniform and extended to cause a detectable change on stellar kinematics in a range of 4  kpc .",
    "this point requires a detailed analysis that is beyond the scope of this letter , and we leave it to a later study ( paper  ii ) .",
    "here we assume that the dark halo is undetectable and focus on the dark disk , for which this explanation is not viable .",
    "figure  [ f_darkdisk ] compares our results with models where a dark disk is considered .",
    "they require the definition of two additional parameters : the exponential scale height of the dark component h@xmath45 , and its density at @xmath1=0 , normalized with respect to the dark halo , @xmath7/@xmath8 .",
    "we considered two families of models , a relatively thinner ( h@xmath45=2.4  kpc ) dark disk with @xmath7/@xmath8=0.25 - 1.0 , as proposed by re8 , and a thicker , less dense one ( h@xmath45=4.6  kpc , @xmath7/@xmath8=0.15 - 0.30 ) , from .",
    "the measured surface density matches the baryonic mass alone , and any curve including the dark disk departs from the central solution , being therefore less likely .",
    "hence , there is no evidence for a flattened dark component , but its expected contribution is small compared to the errors and its existence can not be completely ruled out .",
    "however , not all combinations of dark disk parameters are permitted by our observations : the solutions fall in the 1@xmath21-strip , but only the less dense models of do .",
    "this is entirely due to the lower densities of the first family of models .",
    "in fact , for a fixed @xmath7/@xmath8 , the thick models depart more from the observed curve , and they require a higher increment of @xmath46 compared to models ( see figure  [ f_increment ] ) .",
    "we can thus derive important constraints : a lower density is favored in all cases , and thinner disks should be preferred , while thick and dense dark disks ( h@xmath474  kpc , @xmath7/@xmath480.5 ) are less likely .",
    "numerical simulations showed that low - latitude merging of massive satellites are required to form a heated disk kinematically similar to the galactic thick disk @xcite , but these events produce denser dark disks .",
    "in addition , showed that the observed density of the stellar thick disk can be reproduced only by a few models , all implying a more massive dark disk ( @xmath7/@xmath480.4 ) . in summary , correctly predicting the thick disk kinematical _ and _ dark disk properties is a challenging task .",
    "models for thick disk formation alternative to the merging scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are preferred , while the mondian prediction of @xcite , i.e. a 60% increase of disk mass due to a phantom disk ( @xmath930 @xmath3 pc@xmath4 at 2  kpc ) is in contradiction with our results .",
    "it could be argued that our model of visible mass , it relies on poorly - constrained quantities , such as the ism contribution and @xmath44(1.1  kpc ) , and a downward correction of these parameters would shift all the model curves to lower values .",
    "therefore , in figure  [ f_increment ] we analyzed both the expected and measured increment of @xmath35 , i.e. the surface density of the mass comprised between @xmath1 and 2  kpc .",
    "this quantity is completely independent of the ism at these galactic heights , and the assumed value of @xmath44(1.1  kpc ) introduces a negligible uncertainty ( @xmath490.15 @xmath3 pc@xmath4 ) .",
    "figure  [ f_increment ] shows exactly the same situation analyzed previously , and our conclusions should be considered independent of the details and uncertainties of the modeled visible mass .",
    "we estimated the galactic surface mass density between 2 and 4  kpc from the plane , finding @xmath0(2  kpc)=58@xmath26 @xmath3 pc@xmath4 , and a nearly flat curve .",
    "our results strikingly match the visible mass alone , and we do not detect evidence for any dark component , although the dark halo could have passed unseen . there is no compelling evidence for a dark disk , but within the errors of our investigation , its existence can not be completely excluded .",
    "we derive important constraints on its expected properties : lower densities ( @xmath7/@xmath500.25 ) should be preferred in any case , and a thin dark disk ( h@xmath512.5  kpc ) better reconciles with observations .",
    "a thick and dense dark disk ( h@xmath524  kpc , @xmath7/@xmath480.5 ) should be excluded .",
    "any merging model aiming to reproduce the formation of the galactic thick disk and a flat dark component will need to consider the constraints from our investigation .",
