    "@xcite shows a transition from antibunching to bunching in light collected from an atomic beam into a cavity mode .",
    "the effect is visible because the cavity supports only one spatial mode out of the infinity in free space , and this ensures that the light detected from different atoms is spatially coherent .",
    "any measurement protocol involving individual atoms in a cavity requires information that the atom is coupled to the cavity mode .",
    "the information manifests itself in two ways : as an increase in the amount of light in the mode owing to collection of atomic spontaneous emission , or as a decrease in the amount of light that the cavity transmits , owing to atomic absorption or dispersion .",
    "cavity qed enhances the rate of spontaneous emission collection , and excitation perpendicular to the cavity mode enables high rejection of background light @xcite .",
    "detection of a decrease in driven cavity transmission requires the averaging of the intrinsic shot noise until the intensity level change is significant , and needs strong atom - cavity coupling for rapid detection @xcite .",
    "experiments have demonstrated single atom detection using both methods for moving atoms @xcite and trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "we have developed a technique for atom detection that combines elements of driven cavity qed detection and spontaneous emission collection .",
    "we observe atoms in the mode volume of an optical cavity through the collection of spontaneous emission and faraday - rotated forward scattering into an orthogonally polarized cavity mode that is not driven @xcite .",
    "the technique allows rapid identification of highly - coupled atoms , as well as measurements of photon correlations and single - atom dynamics that are difficult to perform in free space .",
    "this paper presents our approach , in particular detailed autocorrelation studies of the transmitted light that is basically the result of resonance fluorescence .",
    "we identify contributions from different physical processes to the autocorrelation signal in the short time ( atomic decay ) and long time ( transit of atoms through the mode ) @xcite .",

    "intersecting the cavity axis at near - normal incidence is a slow - moving beam of neutral @xmath3rb atoms , each of which interacts with the cavity mode for some time before leaving . because of the large difference in time scales ( 5 @xmath0s transit time versus 26 ns excited state lifetime ) , the atoms become excited and scatter the drive light many times while in the mode volume .",

    "[ figure2],width=297 ]    the crux of our detection scheme is the separation of the cavity output field into two distinct components relative to the polarization of the exciting laser : one parallel ( driven mode ) which is little affected by the transiting atoms , and the other perpendicular ( undriven mode ) which in the ideal case is populated only by scattered light from the atoms ( see ref .",

    "the second configuration has a weak magnetic field along the cavity axis , while keeping the same polarization arrangement ( see fig .  [",

    "the linearly polarized drive can then be considered as the sum of two circular components with different indices of refraction due to the zeeman shift .",
    "this results in a faraday rotation of the drive into the perpendicular mode .",

    "where we have demonstrated detection , the combination of the two processes leaves the atom in a mixed state of @xmath7-sublevels after the photon detections .",
    "this technique is a classical determination of atom presence rather than a projection onto a pure quantum state .",

    "[ xperp2 ] , the signal rate for both spontaneous emission collection and faraday rotation ( for small rotations ) depends on the square of the single - atom cooperativity , which is proportional to the cavity finesse . for a given mode volume , increasing the finesse by some factor ( through higher reflection coefficients on the mirrors ) will in general increase the detection efficiency",
    "however , the cavity linewidth decreases by the same factor , which may reduce the rate of escape of light from the cavity .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of faraday rotation to birefringence is independent of the finesse , since both arise from a rotation of the polarization on each round trip of the light .",
