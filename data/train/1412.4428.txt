    "in dynamic asset pricing models , stochastic discount factors ( sdfs ) are stochastic processes that assign prices to claims to future payoffs over different investment horizons .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite show that sdf processes may be decomposed into permanent and transitory components .",
    "the _ permanent component _ is a martingale that induces an alternative probability measure which is used to characterize pricing over long investment horizons .",
    "the _ transitory component _ is related to the return on a discount bond of ( asymptotically ) long maturity . @xcite and",
    "the subsequent literature on bounds has found that sdfs must have nontrivial permanent and transitory components in order to explain a number of salient features of historical returns data .",
    "@xcite show that the permanent - transitory decomposition obtains even in very general semimartingale environments , suggesting that the decomposition is a fundamental feature of arbitrage - free asset pricing models .",
    "this paper introduces econometric methods to extract the permanent and transitory components of the sdf process .",
    "specifically , we show how to estimate the solution to the perron - frobenius eigenfunction problem introduced by @xcite from a time series of data on state variables and the sdf process . by estimating directly the eigenvalue and eigenfunction",
    ", one can reconstruct empirically the time series of the permanent and transitory components and investigate their properties ( e.g. the size of the components , their correlation , etc ) .",
    "the methodology also allows one to estimate both the yield and the change of measure which characterizes pricing over long investment horizons .",
    "this approach is fundamentally different from existing empirical methods for studying the permanent - transitory decomposition , which produce bounds on various moments of the permanent and transitory components as functions of asset returns @xcite .",
    "the pathbreaking work of @xcite shows that the sdf decomposition may be obtained analytically in markovian environments by solving a perron - frobenius eigenfunction problem .",
    "the permanent and transitory components are formed from the sdf , the eigenvalue , and its eigenfunction .",
    "the eigenvalue is a long - run discount factor that determines the average yield on long - horizon payoffs .",
    "the eigenfunction captures dependence of the price of long - horizon payoffs on the state .",
    "the probability measure that characterizes pricing over long investment horizons may be expressed in terms of the eigenfunction and another eigenfunction that is obtained from a time - reversed perron - frobenius problem .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for related theoretical developments .",
    "the methodology introduced in this paper complements the existing theoretical literature by providing an _ empirical _",
    "framework for estimating the perron - frobenius eigenvalue and eigenfunctions from a time series of data on the markov state and the sdf process .",
    "empirical versions of the permanent and transitory components can then be recovered from the estimated eigenvalue and eigenfunction .",
    "the methodology is _ nonparametric _ ,",
    "i.e. , it does not place any tight parametric restrictions on the law of motion of state variables or the joint distribution of the state variables and the sdf .",
    "this approach is coherent with the existing literature on bounds on the permanent and transitory components , which are derived without placing any parametric restrictions on the joint distribution of the sdf , its permanent and transitory components , and asset returns .",
    "this approach is also in line with conventional moment - based estimators for asset pricing models , such as gmm @xcite and its various extensions .",
    "examples include conditional moment based estimation methodology of @xcite which has been applied to estimate asset pricing models featuring habits @xcite and recursive preferences @xcite and the extended method of moments methodology of @xcite which is particularly relevant for derivative pricing .    in structural macro - finance models , sdf processes ( and their permanent and transitory components )",
    "are determined by both the preferences of economic agents and the dynamics of state variables .",
    "several works have shown that standard preference and state specifications can struggle to explain salient features of historical returns data .",
    "@xcite find that certain specifications appear unable to generate a sdf whose permanent component is large enough to explain historical return premia without also generating unrealistically large spreads between long- and short - term yields .",
    "@xcite find that historical returns data support positive covariance between the permanent and transitory components , but that this positive association can not be replicated by workhorse models such as the long - run risks model @xcite .",
    "the role of dynamics can be subtle , especially with recursive preferences that feature forward - looking components .",
    "the nonparametric methodology introduced in this paper may be used together with parametric methods to better understand the roles of dynamics and preferences in building models whose permanent and transitory components have empirically realistic properties .",
    "of course , if state dynamics are treated nonparametrically then certain forward - looking components , such as the continuation value function under @xcite recursive preferences , are not available analytically .",
    "we therefore introduce nonparametric estimators of the continuation value function in models with @xcite recursive preferences with elasticity of intertemporal substitution ( eis ) equal to unity ..",
    "our approach is different from theirs for a number of reasons discussed in section [ s : emp ] .",
    "further , we study formally the large - sample properties of our estimators whereas @xcite do not . ]",
    "this class of preferences is used in prominent empirical work , such as @xcite , and may also be interpreted as risk - sensitive preferences as formulated by @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we reinterpret the fixed - point problem solved by the value function as a _ nonlinear _ perron - frobenius problem . in so doing ,",
    "we draw connections with the literature on nonlinear perron - frobenius theory following @xcite .",
    "the methodology is applied to study an environment similar to that in @xcite .",
    "we assume a representative agent with @xcite preferences with unit elasticity of intertemporal substitution . however , instead of modeling consumption and earnings using a homoskedastic gaussian var as in @xcite , we model consumption growth and earnings growth as a general ( nonlinear ) markov process .",
    "we recover the time series of the sdf process and its permanent and transitory components without assuming any parametric law of motion for the state .",
    "the permanent component is large enough to explain historical returns on equities relative to long - term bonds , strongly countercyclical , and highly correlated with the sdf .",
    "we also show that the permanent component induces a probability measure that tilts the historical distribution of consumption and earnings growth towards regions of low earnings and consumption growth and away from regions of high consumption growth . to understand better the role of dynamics",
    ", we estimate the permanent and transitory components corresponding to different calibrations of preference parameters .",
    "we find that the permanent and transitory components can be positively correlated for high ( but not unreasonable ) values of risk aversion .",
    "in contrast , we find that parametric linear - gaussian and linear models with stochastic volatility fitted to the same data have permanent and transitory components that are negatively associated .",
    "these findings suggest that nonlinear dynamics may have a useful role to play in explaining the long end of the term structure .",
    "although the paper is presented in the context of sdf decomposition , the methodology can be applied to study more general processes such as the valuation and stochastic growth processes in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the sieve approach that we use for estimation builds on earlier work on nonparametric estimation of markov diffusions by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this approach approximates the infinite - dimensional eigenfunction problem by a low - dimensional matrix eigenvector problem whose solution is trivial to compute .",
    "( @xmath1 is the sample size ) whereas with sieves the dimension is @xmath2 . ]",
    "this approach also sidesteps nonparametric estimation of the transition density of the state .",
    "the main theoretical contributions of the paper may be summarized as follows .",
    "first , we study formally the large - sample properties of the estimators of the perron - frobenius eigenvalue and eigenfunctions .",
    "we show that the estimators are consistent , establish convergence rates for the function estimators , and establish asymptotic normality of the eigenvalue estimator and estimators of other functionals .",
    "these large - sample properties are established in a manner that is sufficiently general that it can allow for the sdf process to be either of a known functional form or containing components that are first estimated from data ( such as preference parameters and continuation value functions ) .",
    "although the analysis is confined to models in which the state vector is observable , the main theoretical result applies equally to models in which components of the state are latent .",
    "second , semiparametric efficiency bounds for the eigenvalue and related functionals are also derived for the case in which the sdf is of a known functional form and the estimators are shown to attain their bounds .",
    "third , we establish consistency and convergence rates for sieve estimators of the continuation value function for a class of models with recursive preferences .",
    "the derivation of the large sample properties of the eigenfunction / value estimators is nonstandard as the eigenfunction / value are defined implicitly by an unknown , nonselfadjoint operator .",
    "the literature on nonparametric eigenfunction estimation to date has focused almost exclusively on the selfadjoint case ( see @xcite and @xcite for sieve estimation and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for a kernel approach ) .",
    "the exception is @xcite and @xcite who establish asymptotic normality of kernel - based eigenfunction and eigenvalue estimators for nonparametric euler equation models .",
    "the derivation of convergence rates for the time - reversed eigenfunction , semiparametric efficiency bounds , and asymptotic normality of the eigenvalue estimator ( and estimators of related functionals ) are all new .",
