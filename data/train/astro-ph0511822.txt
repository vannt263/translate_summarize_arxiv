    "the existence of disks around b[e ] supergiants seems nowadays to be well established .",
    "to date it is , however , not clear how close to the surface of a hot star the material can drop neutral to allow molecule and dust formation .",
    "the [ oi ] emission lines in the optical spectra of these stars ( see fig.1 ) are a perfect tracer of neutral material due to the equal ionization potential of h and o. they therefore mirror the neutral material in the circumstellar disk .",
    "for our model calculations we assume that the [ oi ] emitting regions are completely neutral in hydrogen .",
    "the free electrons necessary to collisionally excite oi are provided by elements with much lower ionization potential , i.e fe , ca , mg , etc .",
    "we use oxygen abundances of @xmath0 and @xmath1 solar for the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "the radial density distribution follows from the equatorial mass loss rate , @xmath2 , and terminal velocity , @xmath3 , via the equation of mass continuity ; @xmath4 is given in terms of @xmath5 .",
    "to calculate the level population we solve the statistical equilibrium equations in a 5-level atom ; the forbidden lines are optically thin , simplifying the line luminosity calculation .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are summarized in table1 . fixed parameters during calculations",
    "are : @xmath6km / s ( as suggested from the line wings of the [ oi ] lines , fig.1 ) , @xmath7k was found to be the best temperature to minimize @xmath8 , and the disk opening angle is set to 23@xmath9",

    "for the smc b[e ] supergiants the [ oi ] lines were ( besides fe ) the only detectable forbidden emission lines , indicating that the emission region of the forbidden lines must be of rather high density and low ( @xmath27k ) temperature .",
    "fig.2 shows the increase in integrated line luminosity as a function of distance from the star . for comparison ,",
    "the observed line luminosities are indicated by the arrows to the right .",
    "the calculated line luminosities saturate at distances of roughly 100r@xmath28 . beyond this point ,",
    "the disk parameters , especially @xmath29 , might change , i.e. the disk might cool rapidly , to allow for molecule and dust formation at larger distances .",
    "r126 is different from the smc b[e ] supergiants in the sense that it also shows forbidden emission lines of slightly higher ionized elements , like [ nii ] , [ sii ] , and [ oii ] . in fig.3",
    "we show the results of the fitting of the oxygen lines with two different scenarios : ( i ) the [ oii ] emission comes from the polar wind only , while the [ oi ] emission comes from a completely ( hydrogen ) neutral disk ( left panels ) , and ( ii ) the [ oii ] emission comes from the still ionized inner parts of the outflowing disk while the [ oi ] emission comes from distances in the disk where oii has already recombined ( right panels ) .",
    "which scenario is really the correct one can only be disentangled with a full analysis of the emission lines in combination with the modeling of the continuum emission ( ff - fb ) , which is currently in preparation .",
    "* @xmath30oi ] emission lines trace the dense and cool h neutral disk material around b[e ] supergiants . *",
    "modeling of their line luminosities under the assumption of an outflowing disk scenario requests that the disk must be neutral very close to the stellar surface , in agreement with model calculations @xcite . *",
    "the assumptions made for the model calculations are such that the disk mass loss rates are _ lower limits_. * the knowledge of the proper ionization structure of the b[e ] supergiant stars disks is very important when modeling the near - ir excess , i.e. the free - free and free - bound emission from the non - spherical wind .    m.k . acknowledges financial support from the nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek grant no.614.000.310 .",
