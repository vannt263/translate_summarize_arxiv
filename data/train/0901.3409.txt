    "at present , infrared detectors are mostly based on narrow - gap semiconductors utilizing the interband transitions .",

    "the necessity of further extension of the wavelength range covered by photodetectors and imaging devices on their base , widening of their functionality , as well as cost reduction of the production by using a mature processing technology has stimulated the development of quantum - well infrared photodetectors ( qwips ) based on a@xmath0b@xmath1 compound systems and sige alloys and utilizing intersubband ( intraband ) transitions ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .",
    "quantum - dot and quantum - wire infrared photodetectors ( qdips and qrips ) were also proposed  @xcite and realized by many groups .",
    "the utilization of graphene layers and graphene bilayers  @xcite opens up real prospects in the creation of novel photodetectors .",
    "the most important advantage of graphene relates to the possibility to control in a wide range the energy gap by patterning of the graphene layer into an array of narrow strips ( nanoribbons )  @xcite .",
    "the energy gap in graphene bilayers can be varied by the transverse electric field  @xcite in different gated heterostructures .",
    "the graphene - based photodetectors can exhibit relatively high quantum efficiency ( due to the use of interband transitions ) and be easily integrated with silicon readout circuits .",
    "a photodetector for terahertz ( thz ) and infrared ( ir ) radiation based on a field - effect transistor structure with the channel consisting of an array of graphene nanoribbons was proposed and analyzed recently  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the concept of a thz / ir photodetector with the structure of a field - effect transistor with a graphene bilayer as the device channel and photosensitive element . using the developed device model , we calculate and analyze the detector characteristics .",
    "we demonstrate that such a graphene bilayer phototransistor ( gbl - pt ) can operate as very sensitive and voltage tunable thz / ir photodetector at elevated temperatures .",
    "the gbl - pt under consideration has a structure similar to that of a gbl - field - effect transistor  @xcite shown schematically in fig .",
    "the gbl channel placed over a highly conducting substrate is supplied with the source and drain contacts .",
    "the substrate plays the role of the back gate which provides the formation of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the channel when the back gate is biased positively with respect to the source and drain : @xmath2 .",
    "there is a top electrode serving as the top gate which is biased negatively ( @xmath3 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the back - gate , top - gate , and source - drain voltages , respectively .",
    "the negative bias of the top gate results in a depletion of the section of the channel beneath the top gate ( which in the following are referred to as the gated section ) , so that the channel is partitioned into two highly conducting sections ( source and drain sections ) and the depleted gated section . in the gated section the potential barrier for electrons is formed .",
    "this barrier controls the injected electron current from the source to drain .",
    "the gbl - pt band diagram under the bias voltages corresponding to the operation conditions is shown in fig .",
    "we shall assume that the back gate ( substrate ) and the top gate are sufficiently transparent for the incoming radiation .",
    "the gbl - pt operation is associated with the variation of the source - drain electron current under illumination when the electron - holes pairs are generated in the depleted sections .",
    "the photogenerated electrons are swept out to the conducting section ( as shown schematically in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , whereas the photogenerated holes accumulated in the deleted section result in lowering of the potential barrier for the injected electrons . as shown , the variation of the injected electron current can substantially exceed the current created by entirely photogenerated electrons and holes , so that gbl - pts can exhibit large photoelectric gain .",
    "we consider the situation when the gated section is fully depleted .",
    "it occurs when @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the electron charge and @xmath9 are the threshold voltages .",

    "such photodetectors can surpass the gbl - pt considered above .",
