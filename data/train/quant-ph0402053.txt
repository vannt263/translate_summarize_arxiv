    "parametric down - conversion has been used in many experiments @xcite to create polarization entangled photon pairs @xcite .",
    "recent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite work has studied the creation of strong entanglement of large numbers of photons .",
    "the states under consideration are entangled pairs of light pulses such that the polarization of each pulse is completely undetermined , but the polarizations of the two pulses are always anti - correlated .",
    "such states are the polarization equivalent of approximate singlet states of two potentially very large spins @xcite .",
    "an application of the states for quantum key distribution has been suggested @xcite .    in any realistic experiment photons",
    "will be lost during propagation .",
    "it is therefore of great practical interest to analyze the resilience of the multi - photon entanglement under loss .",
    "a priori this seems like a very difficult task , because it requires the quantification of the entanglement present in mixed quantum states of high or actually even infinite dimensionality .",
    "however , the multi - photon states introduced in the above work exhibit very high symmetry - in the absence of losses they are spin singlets . the related symmetry under joint polarization transformations on both pulses is preserved even in the presence of polarization - independent losses .",
    "this makes it possible to apply the concepts of ` entanglement under symmetry ' developed in refs.@xcite to the quantification of the multi - photon entanglement in the presence of losses .",
    "we calculate the degree of entanglement for the resulting states of high symmetry , as quantified in terms of the relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "we show that some ( distillable ) entanglement remains for arbitrarily high losses .",
    "in the above - mentioned experiments and proposals a non - linear crystal is pumped with a strong laser pulse , and a three - wave mixing effect leads to the creation of photons along two directions @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to a good approximation the hamiltonian in the interaction picture in a four - mode description",
    "is given by @xmath2 the real coupling constant @xmath3 is proportional to the amplitude of the pump field and to the relevant non - linear optical coefficient of the crystal , and @xmath4 denotes the phase of the pump field .",
    "photons are created into the four modes with annihilation operators @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote horizontal and vertical polarization .",
    "note that both the modes and the associated annihilation operators will be denoted with the same symbol . in the absence of losses",
    ", this hamiltonian leads to a state vector of the form @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the effective interaction time and @xmath13 obtained from the state vector eq .",

    "this invariance of @xmath16 is inherited by the multi - photon states created through the action of @xmath16 on the vacuum .",
    "this symmetry can be expressed as @xmath23 for all @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , and the real vector @xmath26 is specified by @xmath27 , @xmath28 denoting the vector of pauli matrices . here",
    "the angular momentum operator @xmath29 can be written as @xmath30 .",
    "the components of @xmath31 associated with spatial mode @xmath0 are given by the familiar quantum stokes parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 corresponding to light that is linearly polarized at @xmath36 , and @xmath37 to left and right - hand circularly polarized light .",
    "analogous relations hold for spatial mode @xmath1 .    in the present work we are interested in the states created by @xmath16 in the presence of losses .",
    "these losses will be modeled by four beam splitters of transmittivity @xmath38 $ ] , one for each of the modes @xmath39 , where the modes are mixed with vacuum modes .",
    "explicitly , the operation @xmath40 corresponding to losses characterized by @xmath41 acting on a single mode @xmath0 is given by @xmath42 with @xmath43 being given by @xmath44 one can easily verify that these operators satisfy @xmath45 required for trace preservation . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the situation where an equal amount of loss occurs in all four modes",
    ". we will denote the corresponding quantum operation by @xmath46 it is not difficult to apply this loss channel to the state @xmath47 of eq .",
    "( [ pdcrho ] ) .",
    "however , the resulting expression is quite unwieldy , and quantifying the entanglement present in the state seems like a hopeless task at first sight .",
    "we will now discuss general properties of the resulting state that allow a simple parametrization and as a consequence the determination of its entanglement .    in the absence of losses ,",
    "all components of the state created by the action of @xmath16 have an equal number of photons in the @xmath0 modes and in the @xmath1 modes , since photons are created in pairs .",
    "the state vector @xmath48 of eq .",
    "( [ pdcstate ] ) is a superposition of terms corresponding to different total photon numbers . for any given term we will denote the number of photons in the @xmath0 modes by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the number of photons in mode @xmath51 etc",
    "analogously , the number of photons in the @xmath1 modes is denoted by @xmath52 .",

    "( [ psin- ] ) .",
    "losses reduce this entanglement , but do not make the state become separable , as will be seen below .",
    "the state vector @xmath63 corresponds to a spin state vector @xmath64 with @xmath65 . note that in this representation a single photon corresponds to a spin-1/2 system",
    "a state with fixed photon numbers @xmath53 and @xmath54 thus corresponds to a state of two fixed general spins @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the key feature of the lossy channel @xmath68 of eq . ( [ loss ] ) is that it does not destroy the symmetry described by eq .",

    "applying @xmath72 to @xmath73 gives @xmath74 on the other hand , applying first @xmath75 and then the loss operation gives @xmath76 in which the last term is different .",
    "however , this term just corresponds to a coupling in of unpopulated modes with a coefficient @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting lossy channel is invariant under the map @xmath78 , since these modes are unpopulated .",
    "this implies that the state after application of the loss operation @xmath79 has the same symmetry as before . note that for this argument to hold , the amount of loss in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes does not have to be the same , since the transformations are applied independently to each of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "however , within each spatial mode , losses must be polarisation insensitive .",
    "the identification of the above symmetry dramatically simplifies the description of the resulting states . the most general state @xmath59 with fixed value of @xmath53 and @xmath54 for which @xmath82 for all @xmath24 is of the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xcite , essentially as a consequence of schur s lemma @xcite . here , the @xmath85 form a probability distribution for all @xmath86 in the allowed values for @xmath87 . in turn",

    "note that the most general state with exactly one photon in each spatial mode would be characterized by @xmath97 parameters .",
    "in order to quantify the entanglement in a given physical situation , one has to determine the coefficients @xmath58 of eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) and @xmath85 of eq .",

    "since the @xmath85 characterize the normalized state @xmath59 , they only depend on the relative probabilities of the different values of @xmath103 for given @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "( [ probs ] ) then implies that they depend on the interaction time @xmath106 and the transmission @xmath41 only via the combination @xmath107 $ ] , which ranges from zero for perfect transmission ( or , less interestingly , zero interaction time ) to one in a limit of complete loss and infinite interaction time .",
    "for example , for @xmath91 , the single independent parameter @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 where as before @xmath110 .",
    "this gives @xmath111    to quantify the entanglement present in the total state , one can proceed by considering each @xmath59 separately .",
    "there is no unique measure of entanglement for mixed states . instead",
    ", there are several inequivalent ones , each of which is associated with a different physical operational interpretation @xcite .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite , which will be employed in the present paper specifies to which extent a given state can be operationally distinguished from the closest state that is regarded as being disentangled .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement of a state @xmath47 is defined as @xmath112 where @xmath113 $ ] denotes the quantum relative entropy of the state @xmath47 relative to the state @xmath28 . here",

    "this set of states includes the set of separable states , but in general also contains bound entangled states @xcite .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement is an upper bound to the distillable entanglement @xcite , providing a measure of the entanglement available as a resource for quantum information purposes @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the states dramatically simplifies the calculation of the relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "as follows immediately from the convexity of the relative entropy and the invariance under joint unitary operations , the closest ppt state can always be taken to be a state of the same symmetry @xcite .",
    "hence , the closest ppt state is characterized by the same small number of parameters . for simplicity of notation",
    ", we will denote the subset of state space corresponding to specific numbers @xmath53 , @xmath54 of photons as @xmath86-photon space . in the @xmath115-photon space",
    "let us denote the closest ppt state as @xmath116 forming the partial transpose of this state , and demanding that the resulting operator be non - negative , gives the condition @xmath117 . in this simplest space ,",
    "all symmetric states lie on the straight line segment @xmath118 $ ] with the ppt region extending from the origin to the midpoint ( see fig .  1 ) .    in general , for higher photon numbers @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the set of symmetric states",
    "are represented by a simplex in a @xmath119-dimensional space , the coordinates of which are denoted by @xmath85 . in turn ,",
    "the ppt criterion gives rise to a number of linear inequalities , such that the set of invariant operators with a positive partial transpose corresponds again to a simplex .",
    "the intersection of the two simplices corresponds to the invariant ppt states , and the coordinates are denoted by @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "the situation with @xmath121 is depicted explicitly in fig .  1 . the simplex corresponding to symmetric states , characterized by the condition that the @xmath122 form a probability distribution , is in these three cases a straight line segment , an equilateral triangle , and a regular tetrahedron respectively .",
    "the vertices of the simplex represent the normalized projectors @xmath123 .",
    "states in the interior of the simplex are convex combinations of all the allowed projectors .",
    "the ppt set with the same symmetry is clearly marked .",
    "[ triangles ]     [ entanglement ]    fig .",
    "1 also shows the curves traced by the down - conversion states when they are subject to loss .",
    "as discussed above , the position of the states on the curve is determined by the single parameter @xmath124 . for perfect transmission corresponding to @xmath125 the quantum state in an @xmath126 photon space",
    "has @xmath127 for all values of @xmath106 , corresponding to maximal entanglement .",
    "as losses are increased the state migrates towards the ppt boundary .",
    "it is an important immediate consequence of eq .",
    "( [ muzero ] ) that for all losses @xmath128 , the number @xmath129 is always greater than @xmath130 for any finite @xmath106 and for all @xmath53 . for any finite @xmath106 , @xmath131 as @xmath132 ( which corresponds to a limit of zero transmission time and infinite interaction time ) .",
    "this holds true for @xmath133 , but also for higher values of @xmath53 : the state remains outside the ppt set for any non - vanishing @xmath106 and for arbitrarily high losses .",
    "therefore , the above results show that there is always some entanglement in the down - conversion state , as quantified in terms of the relative entropy of entanglement . as a corollary , which one can already infer from the lowest dimensional subspace , @xmath133",
    ", there is actually distillable entanglement in the down - conversion state , regardless of how lossy the transmission from the source to the detector .",
    "we now proceed to quantify the entanglement in the states more explicitly .",
    "since @xmath134 is convex and the set of symmetric ppt states is convex , finding the closest state @xmath28 amounts to solving a convex optimisation problem .",
    "for different values of @xmath135 the quantities @xmath136 have been evaluated , where @xmath137 denotes the ppt state which is the unique global minimum in the convex optimization problem , i.e. , the ppt state closest to the down - conversion state . for generic states ,",
    "this optimization problem would still be convex , yet , the dimensionality of state space grows as @xmath138 .",
    "the symmetry dramatically reduces the dimensionality of the constraint set to searched to @xmath139 , and thus makes the quantification of the entanglement a feasible task .",
    "for instance , for a state with three photons on each side , one has to consider only three objective variables instead of 255 .",
    "the total relative entropy of entanglement is given by the expression @xmath140 the average photon number before loss @xmath141 is related to the interaction time @xmath106 as @xmath142 .",
    "the average photon number after loss is @xmath143 .",
    "2 shows the relative entropy of entanglement calculated as described above for @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "one sees that significant entanglement remains even for substantial losses .",
    "we have shown how symmetry considerations make possible the quantification of entanglement for states produced by parametric down - conversion and subject to losses .",
