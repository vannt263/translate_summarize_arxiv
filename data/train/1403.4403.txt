    "because of the intensive use of carbon dioxide in industry and research @xcite , it has become necessary to determine its thermodynamic , physical and chemical properties on an extended range of temperatures",
    ". significant effort has been deployed to build up a database through observations and theoretical calculations @xcite . from the former point of view , we mention the case of the accurate measurements due to giauque & egan @xcite and from the latter point of view , the derivation based on the classical version of the theory of lattice dynamics , which predicts the heat capacity of carbon dioxide in the range of temperatures 15@xmath4@xmath1@xmath450 k @xcite , is in a very good agreement with that obtained through observations @xcite .    however , such a good agreement is still out of reach for some other properties of carbon dioxide due to difficulties from both experimental and theoretical points of view .",
    "for instance , the empirical determination of the latent heat of sublimation at low temperatures remains a major obstacle because of the difficulty in eliminating the superheating of the gas @xcite .",
    "similarly , by way of example , the lagrangian classical treatment of the two - dimensional rigid rotor is intractable and the theoretical determination of the heat capacity , mentioned above , had been made possible at only sufficiently low temperatures ( @xmath1@xmath450 k ) when the harmonic approximation is valid @xcite . with that said ,",
    "much work has to be done in order to determine further properties of carbon dioxide particularly at low temperatures , such properties are still missing in the best compendia .",
    "we will exploit the data available in @xcite , which we refer to as g&e , and show that it is possible to evaluate the heat of sublimation @xmath5 and vapor pressure @xmath6 at temperatures 5@xmath2@xmath1@xmath2195 k. a key prerequisite is the determination of the heat of sublimation at @xmath1=0 k ( @xmath7=@xmath8 ) .",
    "stull calculated an average value of @xmath5 by the method of least squares using the vapor pressure data measured by different workers @xcite and obtained a value of 26.3 kj@xmath3mol^-1^ ( = 6286 cal@xmath3mol^-1^ ) for 139@xmath2@xmath1@xmath2195 k @xcite .",
    "however , the literature citations listed in @xcite show that stull did not extract data from g&e , which is even more accurate and includes data concerning the heat capacity of the solid carbon dioxide and other data that could be used to obtain @xmath5 at different temperatures . by contrast",
    ", g&e have evaluated @xmath5 at 194.67 k using partly their measured data and available data for @xmath5 at lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "they evaluated the integral of the heat capacity of the solid ( change in the enthalpy ) graphically from a smooth curve through their measured data and obtained a value for @xmath5 that is merely 10 cal@xmath3mol^-1^ higher than their measured value @xmath9=6030@xmath105 cal@xmath3mol^-1^ ( 25230@xmath1021 j@xmath3mol^-1^ ) .",
    "they also evaluated the entropies of the gas and solid at 194.67 k and reached an _",
    "excellent _ agreement between experimental data and statistics ( the experimental & spectroscopic values of the entropy of the gas @xmath11 they obtained were 47.59 & 47.55 cal@xmath3k^-1^@xmath3mol^-1^ , respectively , constituting a proof of the third law @xcite ) .",
    "however , this cumbersome procedure had prevented them from carrying out a systematic evaluation of the latent heat and entropy at temperatures covering the range of their measured data .",
    "furthermore , this procedure ( the graphical evaluation ) adds a human error , which is an unknown factor .    in this paper",
    "we will carry out a systematic evaluation of the fore - mentioned physical quantities on a more extended range of temperatures than that of g&e using 1 ) a computer algebra system ( cas ) , which eliminates the human error and allows an excellent adjustment of the parameters in order to achieve a better accuracy , as well as 2 ) an established formula for the vapor pressure .",
    "it will be shown below that our reevaluated value of @xmath12 is 6030.4 cal@xmath3mol^-1^ ( 25231 j@xmath3mol^-1^ ) .",
    "the data for the relevant quantities will be tabulated at temperatures incremented by 5 k and plotted . moreover ,",
    "the generating codes will be provided , which allow the evaluation of any quantity at any given temperature within minutes of time . in this work , we will be relying on measured data by different workers and on some empirical formulas derived by graphical interpolation .",
    "since some of these data are provided without accuracy and some other lack accuracy due to personal error , it will be difficult to assign accuracy to our results , as is the case in most compendia .",
    "some values of @xmath6 ( in torr ) will be given with one significant digit while other values with 2 or 3 significant digits .",
    "the values of @xmath5 ( of the order of 26000 j@xmath3mol^-1^ ) will be given with five digits without decimals , assuming an error not higher than 0.35% .",
    "the accuracy of the results for @xmath6 and @xmath5 can be read by comparing with the available measured data .",

    "the g&e heat capacity measurements , shown in the codes ( appendix ) , extend from 15.52 to 189.78 k. on such a large interval there is no best equation that will represent the data @xcite .",
    "g&e worked on a smooth curve through the data but did not describe it . in order to represent the data ,",
    "the alternative is to subdivide the interval into sufficiently small intervals and represent the data by a polynomial on each sub - interval in such a way that the polynomial pieces blend smoothly making a spline @xcite .",
    "matlab provides spline curve via the command ` spline(x , y ) ` ( see appendix section ) .",
    "it returns the piecewise polynomial form of the cubic spline interpolant with the not - a - knot end conditions , having two continuous derivatives and breaks at all interior data sites except for the leftmost and the rightmost one .",
    "the values of the spline at the breaks ` spline(x , y , x(i ) ) ` coincide with the data values ` y(i ) ` .",
    "cubic splines are more attractive for interpolation purposes than higher - order polynomials @xcite",
    ".    we will deal with molar physical quantities labeled by the subscripts @xmath16 & @xmath17 to differentiate between the solid and gaseous phases .",

    "we take the zero of rotational energy to be that of the @xmath26=0 state and the zero of vibrational energy to be that of the ground state , meaning that a molecule at rest in the gas has an energy of zero at vanishing temperature ( @xmath27=0 ) .",

    "the excellent agreement between the experimental & spectroscopic values of @xmath11 at 194.67 k is due to g&e accurate measurements and to the success of debye s theory at low temperatures .",
    "g&e used debye s formula to evaluate @xmath33 for 0@xmath2@xmath1@xmath215 k. however , they did not explain their choice for debye s temperature @xmath34 . in this work ,",
    "the energy and entropy of the solid for temperatures below 15.52 k are extrapolated by substitution of the debye heat capacity formula .",
    "moreover , we will rely on suzuki & schnepp s assertion that the molar heat capacities of the solid carbon dioxide ( @xmath35 & @xmath36 ) are equal within an error of 10@xmath37 per cent for such small temperatures @xcite .",
    "finally , we fix @xmath38 by equating the heat capacity due to debye with that measured by g&e at 15.52 k ( 0.606 cal@xmath3k^-1^@xmath3mol^-1^ ) .",
    "solving the equation using a cas we find @xmath38=139.59 k.    the matlab codes provided in the appendix are split into three parts . in part ( i ) , ` cd ` represents the debye heat capacity .",
    "the vectors ` t ` & ` cp ` show the temperature data sites used by g&e ( 15.52@xmath39189.78 k ) and the corresponding measured heat capacities ( 0.606@xmath3913.05 cal@xmath3k^-1^@xmath3mol^-1^ ) , respectively .",

    "<S> we investigate the empirical data for the vapor pressure ( 154@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2196 k ) and heat capacity ( 15.52@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2189.78 k ) of the solid carbon dioxide . the approach is both theoretical and numerical , using a computer algebra system ( cas ) . from the latter point of view </S>",
    "<S> , we have adopted a cubic piecewise polynomial representation for the heat capacity and reached an excellent agreement between the available empirical data and the evaluated one . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have obtained values for the vapor pressure and heat of sublimation at temperatures below 195 right down to 0 k. the key prerequisites are the : 1 ) determination of the heat of sublimation of 26250 j@xmath3mol^-1^ at vanishing temperature and 2 ) elaboration of a ` linearized ' vapor pressure equation that includes all the relevant properties of the gaseous and solid phases . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that : 1 ) the empirical vapor pressure equation derived by giauque & egan remains valid below the assumed lower limit of 154 k ( similar argument holds for antoine s equation ) , 2 ) the heat of sublimation reaches its maximum value of 27211 j@xmath3mol^-1^ at 58.829 k and 3 ) the vapor behaves as a ( polyatomic ) ideal gas for temperatures below 150 k. </S>"
