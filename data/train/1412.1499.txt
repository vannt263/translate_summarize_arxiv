    "the mirror of an elliptic @xmath0 orbifold @xmath1 is a landau - ginzburg mirror : it is determined by a polynomial @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a complex parameter .",
    "mirror symmetry asserts that symplectic geometry of @xmath1 is reflected from the complex geometry of @xmath4 , and vice versa .",
    "while the orbifold @xmath1 is only of dimension one , its gromov - witten theory is very interesting and receives a lot of attention in the context of mirror symmetry and integrable systems , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite proposed a systematic construction of landau - ginzburg mirror and a homological mirror functor using lagrangian floer theory . for an elliptic @xmath5 orbifold @xmath1 , where @xmath6 , the construction produces a polynomial @xmath7 whose coefficients are convergent series in the khler parameter @xmath8 of @xmath1 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath9 can be rearranged to the form of @xmath4 by an explicit change of coordinates in @xmath10 .",
    "it is called to be the open gromov - witten potential because it is obtained by counting holomorphic polygons bounded by a fixed lagrangian , which is the lagrangian immersion constructed by seidel @xcite .",
    "the open gromov - witten potential @xmath7 is a priori defined only around the point @xmath11 , the so - called large volume limit of the khler moduli space . in this paper , we show that indeed it can be extended to certain global moduli space :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath7 be the open gromov - witten potential of an elliptic @xmath5 orbifold @xmath1 where @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath7 , which are functions in @xmath8 , are modular forms of certain weight @xmath14 for the modular group @xmath15 or @xmath16 respectively .",
    "hence the potential extends to be a section of the line bundle @xmath17 over the product @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the pull back of the canonical line bundle of the modular curve @xmath20 .",
    "the proof is arithmetic in nature .",
    "we explicitly express the open gromov - witten potential in terms of the dedekind @xmath21-function and eisenstein series , and use known expressions for modular forms with respect to the groups @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we expect the same statement holds for the case @xmath22 , see section [ sec:236 ] for more details .",
    "the theorem also holds for the elliptic orbifold @xmath23 , namely the coefficients of the open gromov - witten potential of @xmath23 are modular forms for the modular group @xmath24 .",
    "see section [ sec:2222 ] . in this case",
    "@xmath25 is defined on the resolved conifold @xmath26 rather than @xmath27 , and its critical locus is the zero section @xmath28 rather than an isolated point .",

    "the mirror functor produces a particular matrix factorization @xmath29 of @xmath9 , which is an odd endomorphism @xmath30 on @xmath31 satisfying @xmath32 .",
    "this matrix factorization has the important property that it split generates the derived category of matrix factorizations , and it is mirror to the seidel lagrangian . using similar arithmetic techniques , we can express @xmath29 in terms of modular forms .",
    "let @xmath29 be the matrix factorization of the open gromov - witten potential @xmath7 which is mirror to the seidel lagrangian in @xmath1 , where @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",

    "why modularity is expected can be explained as follows .",
    "the seidel lagrangian in the elliptic orbifold @xmath34 , where @xmath35 for the @xmath36 case respectively , can be lifted to @xmath37 copies of lagrangians in the elliptic curve @xmath38 .",
    "thus the moduli space around the large volume limit under consideration on the symplectic side is the moduli space of khler structure of @xmath38 _ together with a particular choice of @xmath37 lagrangians_. the mirror is the family of elliptic curves decorated with structures of @xmath37-torsion points , whose moduli space turns out to be the modular curve @xmath20 .",
    "mirror symmetry asserts that the a - side moduli is globally isomorphic to the b - side moduli .",
    "thus @xmath20 should also be the global khler moduli .",
    "our results confirm that the open gromov - witten potential , which is originally just defined around the large volume limit , naturally extend to this global khler moduli space .",

    "roughly speaking it is a sum of the boundary evaluation images of holomorphic polygons bounded by @xmath114 ( weighted by their symplectic areas ) with corners at the immersed generators .",
    "then we choose a subspace @xmath126 of @xmath127 whose elements @xmath128 have odd degrees and satisfy the so - called weak maurer - cartan equation @xcite @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes the fundamental class of @xmath131 .",

    "the hauptmodul is also called to be the mirror map since it gives a map between the khler moduli , parametrized by @xmath40 , and the complex moduli parametrized by @xmath71 .",
