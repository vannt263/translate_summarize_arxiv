    "the knowledge of the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter under exotic conditions , including high isospin asymmetries , finite temperatures , and a wide density range , is essential for our understanding of the nuclear force .",
    "it is important to impose constraints coming both from laboratory measurements and astrophysical on the nuclear models presently used to describe nuclear matter .",
    "the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase refers to matter where quarks and gluons are believed to be deconfined and it probably takes place at temperatures of the order of 150 to 170 mev .",
    "these temperatures were possible in nature only shortly after the big bang . in large colliders around the world ( rhic / bnl , alice / cern , gsi , etc )",
    ", physicists are trying to convert hadronic matter at sufficiently high temperatures into qgp .",
    "possible experiments towards this search are au - au collisions at rhic / bnl and pb - pb collisions at sps / cern , where the hadron abundances and particle ratios are used in order to determine the temperature and baryonic chemical potential of the possibly present hadronic matter - qgp phase transition .",
    "recently relativistic nuclear models have been tested in the high temperature regime produced in these heavy ion collisions . in previous works",
    "these data have already been analyzed @xcite under different perspectives . in @xcite",
    "the authors have used a statistical model which assumes chemical equilibration to find the temperature and baryon chemical potential that provide a best fit to the data obtained by the na49 @xcite and wa97 @xcite collaborations . in this work the interaction among the baryons and mesons were neglected and an eigenvolume was assigned to all particles so that repulsive interactions among hadrons were considered . in @xcite",
    "the nuclear interaction was included through a relativistic self - consistent chiral model of hadrons , which embodies the restoration of chiral symmetry at both high temperatures and densities .",
    "the results depended on the parametrizations used and indicated that no direct freeze - out from the restored phase was observed .    in @xcite",
    "four parametrizations of the non - linear walecka model @xcite , namely nl3 @xcite , tm1 @xcite , gm1 and gm3 @xcite , one model with implicit density dependence through meson field couplings , the nl@xmath0 @xcite and two different parametrizations of a density dependent hadronic model , the tw @xcite and the ddme1 @xcite were used to calculate the au - au collision particle yields .",
    "eighteen baryons , 3 mesons to mediate the nuclear force and pions , kaons , @xmath1s and @xmath2s were included .",
    "it was shown that if the light mesons , e.g. pions and kaons , are not taken in the interaction with baryons the models do not have enough repulsion among hadrons and are not able to reproduce experimental data with the same quality as the thermal model @xcite or the relativistic self - consistent chiral model used in @xcite . within the thermal model the particle production fractions are reproduced with a temperature @xmath3 mev and a baryonic chemical potential @xmath4 mev , while for the chiral model these quantities are @xmath5 mev and the baryon chemical potential of the order of @xmath6 mev . in @xcite these numbers lie in the range @xmath7 mev and @xmath8 mev .",
    "in @xcite the parameters related to the coupling of the hyperons to the mesons were adjusted in accordance with the different hyperonic binding energies and the numbers for the freeze - out temperature and chemical potential with a modified gm3 @xcite parametrization were @xmath9 mev and @xmath10 mev .",
    "it is worth mentioning that all those numbers depend on the set of hyperon couplings , a value not well known .    in the present paper",
    "we test the behaviour of the quark meson coupling model ( qmc ) in this regime of temperature and density . within the qmc model ,",
    "nuclear matter is described as a system of nonoverlapping mit bags which interact through the effective scalar and vector mean fields @xcite .",
    "although the qmc model shares many similarities with the non - linear walecka models ( nlwm ) @xcite , it also offers new opportunities for studying nuclear matter properties .",
    "one of the most attractive aspects of the model is that different phases of hadronic matter , from very low to very high baryon densities and temperatures , can be described within the same underlying model .    in the qmc the internal structure of the nucleon",
    "is introduced explicitly and matter at low densities and temperatures is a system of nucleons interacting through meson fields , with quarks and gluons confined within mit bags . for matter at very high density and/or temperature , one expects that baryons and mesons dissolve and the entire system of quarks and gluons becomes confined within a single , big mit bag . in most cases in the literature ,",
    "the energy of the nucleonic mit bag is identified with the effective mass of the nucleon .",
    "this identification has important implications : at finite temperature , while in the nlwm models the nucleon mass always decreases with temperature , in the qmc it increases @xcite .",
    "the difference arises due to the explicit treatment of the internal structure of the nucleon in the qmc .",
    "when the bag is heated up , quark - antiquark pairs are excited in the interior of the bag , increasing the internal energy of the bag . in the present approach , we identify the effective mass of the nucleon with the free energy of the bag , and as it is shown next a direct consequence is the recovery of the behaviour of the nlwm for the effective mass , i.e. , it decreases with the increase of the temperature .",
    "this choice makes sense because we want to identify the temperature as a state variable .",
    "next we discuss some of the consequences of this choice and apply the qmc to the description of hadron abundances and particle ratios in au - au with @xmath11 gev collisions at rhic / bnl and pb - pb collisions at sps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we give a brief review of the qmc model and its generalization for finite temperatures ; in section iii we present some results refering the description of warm nuclear matter within the qmc and apply the formalism to the description of particle production in au - au @xmath11 gev collisions at rhic / bnl and pb - pb collisions at sps . ; in section iv we draw our final conclusions .",
    "in the qmc model , the nucleon in nuclear medium is assumed to be a static spherical mit bag in which quarks interact with the scalar and vector fields , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath1 and these fields are treated as classical fields in the mean field approximation@xcite .",
