    "observations with the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) of the location of mgro j1908 + 06 were performed as part of a galactic plane survey @xcite , and after the announcement of the milagro source , follow - up observations confirmed an extended vhe source , hess j1908 + 063 @xcite .",

    "the map has a bin size of @xmath31 , but the counts in each bin represent a summation of events in which the reconstructed shower arrival direction is within @xmath29 of the center of the bin .",

    "our best fitted position differs from the position reported for hess j1908 + 063 by @xmath36 . this is larger than the quoted statistical uncertainties , but a relatively small fraction of the gaussian width .",
    "the shift may arise due to systematic effects , e.g.  the fact that the emission is not well described by a symmetric 2d gaussian or a difference in energy bands between the two measurements .      a spectrum derived from a single source region with a radius of 0.5@xmath22 , to account for the extended nature of the tev emission and",

    "the tev emission from j1908 is strong in the region near psr j1907 + 0602 and also extends towards snr g40.50.5 .",
    "a key question regarding the nature of the emission is whether it is solely due to a pwn associated with psr j1907 + 0602 @xcite or whether there are additional sources of tev emission .",
    "we estimate a physical size for j1908 of 50  pc , assuming the pulsar distance of 3.2  kpc and adopting twice the @xmath55 width of the 2d gaussian fit as the source diameter .",
    "comparison with other tev pwne shows that j1908 is larger than other tev pwne of similar age ( see figure  6 in @xcite larger than the size of 36  pc measured in @xcite . ] ) . however , pwn size may depend on environment and interaction with the host snr , particularly for older pwne .",
    "also , j1908 could be made consistent with the size - versus - age relation found for other pwne if the pulsar is assumed to be a factor of two older than the spin - down age .",
    "this is within the uncertainties associated with spin - down age estimates @xcite and would also reduce the proper motion to a more typical value .",
    "the 1 - 10  tev luminosity of j1908 of @xmath56 is 1% of the spin - down power of psr j1907 + 0602 of @xmath57 , which gives a tev gamma - ray efficiency similar to that of other pwne with pulsars of similar spin - down power @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations reveal hard emission from the location of the pulsar that is possibly extended and could be a compact x - ray pwn or possibly a bow shock @xcite .",
    "most , but not all , tev pwn with similar pulsar spin - down power are detected in x - rays @xcite .",
    "thus , the gross properties of j1908 , except possibly its extent , are compatible with its identification as a tev pwn powered by psr j1907 + 0602 .    for j1908",
    ", we find that the spectrum measured near the snr boundary at a projected distance of 23  pc from the pulsar is the same , within uncertainties , as the spectrum measured near the pulsar up to energies of at least 10  tev , see figure  [ fig : spectra ]",
    ". this may present issues with interpretation of the tev emission as solely powered by psr j1907 + 0602 .",
    "if psr j1907 + 0602 was born at the center of g40.50.5 , then electrons nearer to the snr were emitted at earlier times than the electrons near the current pulsar location .",
    "these older populations of electrons would have cooled over the lifetime of the pulsar via synchrotron emission and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering .",
    "assuming an interstellar magnetic field of 3  @xmath14 g and that the seed photons for ic scattering are predominately from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the cooling time for the 63  tev electrons needed to produce 10  tev photons is 12  kyr @xcite . comparing this cooling time with the pulsar age of @xmath58  kyr",
    ", one would expect significant softening or a fall - off at high energies in the spectrum from the region near the snr .",
    "thus , the lack of softening is incompatible with the behavior expected due to electron cooling . the discrepancy is worse if the characteristic age underestimates the true age , as needed to reduce the pulsar velocity to a more typical value .",
    "spectral softening is also seen in tev pwne containing pulsars without very high proper motions .",
    "the tev pwn most similar to j1908 is hess j1825137 with a physical size of @xmath59  pc and a parent pulsar with a characteristic age of 21  kyr , but a proper motion of only @xmath60/year @xcite .",
    "the tev spectrum of hess j1825137 softens with distance from the pulsar , with a photon index of @xmath61 at the pulsar location and @xmath62 at a projected offset of 24  pc @xcite . the change in photon index ,",
    "@xmath63 should be compared with that measured above in j1908 at a similar physical separation from the pulsar , @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the lack of spectral softening in j1908 far from the pulsar may again argue against interpreting it as a single pwn , even if the pulsar was not born in g40.50.5 .",
    "a potential counter example is the tev source tev j2032 + 4130 that is a pwn associated with psr j2032 + 4127 .",
    "veritas observations of the source show no spectral evolution across its extent ( full width at half maximum ) of 11  pc @xcite .",
    "the tev emission from tev j2032 + 4130 appears to be confined to a void apparent in infrared and radio images .",
    "@xcite note that j1908 lies in a void in molecular line emission integrated over @xmath65 = 25.3 - 30.5  km / s corresponding to distances of 1.51.8  kpc .",
    "the physical size of j1908 would be compatible with that tev j2032 + 4130 at this distance .",
    "however , @xcite estimate a distance of @xmath66  kpc for psr j1907 + 0602 based on the pulsar s dispersion measure and place a lower limit on the distance of 3  kpc based on its x - ray flux .",
    "thus , the distance to psr j1907 + 0602 is incompatible with a location in the molecular line emission void unless both pulsar distance estimates are incorrect .",
    "another source , in addition to the pwn associated with psr j1907 + 0602 , may contribute to the observed vhe emission . fitting the vhe excess map using a model with two 2d - gaussians",
    "provides only marginal improvement , at the @xmath67% confidence level , over the fit using a single 2d - gaussian .",
    "thus , we do not claim detection of two separate sources of emission .",
    "however , the observed morphology could be produced by two interacting sources or two sources superimposed along the line of sight .",
    "some snrs produce tev emission via ic interactions of electrons accelerated in the snr shock or via interactions of accelerated hadrons with surrounding target material such as molecular clouds .",
    "comparison of the 1420  mhz radio continuum emission from snr g40.5 - 0.5 with the tev emission shows there is little or no radio emission in the regions of strong tev emission , see figure  [ fig : radiomap ] .",
    "figure [ fig : comap ] shows the veritas excess map with contours of co line emission integrated over @xmath65 = 45 - 65 km / s overlaid ( the co map was kindly provided by @xcite ) .",
    "the distance to the co gas at these velocities , 3.4  kpc , is compatible with the distance to the pulsar and the snr within the uncertainties .",
    "there is co emission , and thus molecular clouds , at the boundary of the tev emission , but not coincident with it . in other middle - aged snrs with tev emission ,",
    "the tev emission is positionally well correlated with co line and/or radio continuum emission , see table  [ table : middle_aged_snr ] .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that snr g40.5 - 0.5 is the main source of the observed tev emission .",
    "the extended morphology of the tev emission could be due to interaction of the pulsar wind with molecular clouds or the expanding snr shell .",
    "a shock formed at such an interaction could reaccelerate energetic particles .",
    "alternatively , the molecular clouds may provide seed photons for inverse - compton scattering on high - energy electrons from the pulsar wind .",
    "the dominant seed photons in j1908 are likely microwave photons from the cmb .",
    "ir photons from molecular clouds with typical temperatures of 1050  k are more energetic than the cmb photons , thus , lower - energy electrons with longer cooling times suffice to produce tev photons .",
    "the increased radiation energy density , relative to the cmb , near the observed clouds may brighten the tev emission near the clouds , causing the extended morphology .    in conclusion , j1908 appears to be physically somewhat larger than other tev pwne of similar age and the tev spectrum does not appear to soften with distance from the pulsar , as observed in similar tev pwne and expected from electron cooling . there is no strong tev emission associated with the radio - bright shell of snr g40.5 - 0.5 .",
    "interaction of the pulsar wind with nearby molecular clouds or the snr shock could explain the large size and lack of spectral softening in j1908 .",
    "it is also possible that another pwn , associated with an undetected second pulsar located near the southern edge of snr g40.5 - 0.5 , could contribute to the vhe emission , but this would require the presence of a second , and as yet undetected , pulsar .",
