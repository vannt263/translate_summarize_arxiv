    "in this work we have introduced and applied an analytic approach , the tpa , that offers a useful improvement over the well - known dpa strategy . in the tpa , harmonic approximations to a potential are not only invoked near the minima or fixed points , but also near a local maximum , in as far as the smooth curvature near this maximum , but not its height , are respected .",
    "this is a meaningful approach , because in contrast to the value in the minima ( equilibrium bulk solutions ) , the value in the maximum is in itself not of physical significance . while the dpa is a widely applied approximation in the context of variational problems in particle mechanics and statistical mechanics , we are not aware of any previous study introducing or employing a tpa .",
    "quite generally , the tpa allows one to improve over the dpa while still obtaining analytical results with modest calculational effort .",
    "* for the wall energy the tpa result constitutes a significant quantitative improvement over the dpa result .",
    "moreover , the variational calculation intrinsic to the tpa leads to an order parameter profile with remarkable smoothness ( at the matching point it is continuous and possesses continuous first and second derivatives ) .",
    "furthermore , the initial slope of the order parameter ( at the wall ) within the tpa is also much improved with respect to the dpa . * for the interfacial profiles and the interfacial tension the tpa offers a modest but interesting improvement over the dpa results . in the strong segregration regime",
    "the improvement for the interfacial tension is significant , simply because the wall energies are ( much ) more accurate in the tpa . in the weak segregation limit the tpa leads to the same interface structure and interfacial tension as the dpa , simply because tpa and dpa coincide for @xmath187 . for intermediate and strong segregation ,",
    "say @xmath188 , the tpa becomes worthwhile and offers a significant improvement over the dpa for profiles and interfacial tension .",
    "furthermore , the tpa shares the qualitatively important feature with the ( exact ) gp theory that the inflection points of the profiles need not coincide with the midpoint of the interface . *",
    "the analytic expression for the interfacial tension within tpa  our main result  is of a remarkable simplicity , and provides a useful and compact refinement of the dpa result , especially for strong segregation .",
