    "there is now significant evidence that we are living in a critical universe in which the vacuum energy ( or some effective equivalent ) dominates and ordinary ( baryonic ) matter is only a tiny fraction of the total matter content : @xmath3 the first two statements are strongly favored by the combination of recent measurements of the luminosity - redshift relation for type ia supernovae at high redshifts and the observed temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "( for a review , see @xcite . )",
    "@xmath4 is also consistent with data from rich clusters of galaxies , in particular from the analysis of the x - radiation emitted by the hot intra - cluster gas .",
    "the total matter contribution of rich clusters can also be determined by making use of ( strong and weak ) gravitational lensing .",
    "such observations provide an estimate of the ratio @xmath5 . @xmath6 and @xmath0",
    "can then be obtained separately by using in addition the primordial abundances of light elements , synthesized during the first three minutes .",
    "( for a discussion of other methods , we refer again to @xcite and references therein . )",
    "readers who do not closely follow these developments should , however , be warned that there remain serious worries .",
    "for instance , one can not yet exclude systematic effects in the supernovae data ( e.g. , intrinsic evolution , extinction ) which could masquerade a cosmological constant .",
    "in this situation any method which provides independent restrictions on the density parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 is of great interest .",
    "lensing statistics on large scales has this potential",
    ". the use of gravitational lensing as a tool to determine cosmological parameters has been suggested in the pioneering works @xcite .",
    "an early detailed study of lensing statistics was performed by turner , ostriker and gott @xcite .",
    "much of the extensive later work is based on this paper .",
    "after some sporadic studies which investigated the effect of the cosmological constant on some specific aspects of lensing , it was pointed out in @xcite that statistical properties of gravitational lensing may exhibit strong @xmath7-dependencies .",
    "this is not the place to review the many more recent studies in the field of lensing statistics .",
    "we confine ourselves to the following remarks ( more extensive references can be found in the quoted papers ) :    \\(i ) several authors have recently re - analyzed the statistics of strong gravitational lensing of distant quasars by galaxies @xcite .",
    "observationally , there are only a few strongly lensed quasars among hundreds of objects .",
    "the resulting bounds on @xmath0 and @xmath1 are , however , not very tight because of systematic uncertainties in the galaxy luminosity functions , dark matter velocity dispersions , galaxy core radii and limitations of the observational material .",
    "\\(ii ) on the basis of existing surveys , the statistics of strongly lensed radio sources has been studied in several recent papers @xcite . beside some advantages for constraining the cosmological model",
    ", there is the problem that the redshift distribution of the radio sources is largely unknown .",
    "( one can , however , make use of a strong correlation between the redshift and flux density distributions . )",
    "\\(iii ) clusters with redshifts in the interval @xmath8 are efficient lenses for background sources at @xmath9 . for several reasons one can expect that the probability for the formation of pronounced arcs is a sensitive function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "first , it is well - known that clusters form earlier in low density universes .",
    "secondly , the proper volume per unit redshift is larger for low density universes and depends strongly on @xmath1 for large redshifts .",
    "an extensive numerical study of arc statistics has been performed by bartelmann et al .",
    "@xcite , with the result that the optical depth depends strongly on @xmath7 . in our semi - analytical treatment ,",
    "discussed below , we find , however , only a weak @xmath7-dependence .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "since most relativists are not familiar with lensing statistics , we repeat in section [ generalities ] some basic concepts ( cross sections , optical depth ) and formulae needed in the theoretical analysis . for a comparison of theoretical expectations with observations , one has to include magnification effects and the observational selection criteria have to be taken into account .",
    "this will be explained in section [ bias ] . in section [ input ]",
    "we discuss further inputs we shall need in our semi - analytical treatment .",
    "this includes the press - schechter formula for the differential comoving cluster number density , dynamical and structural information required for the lens models , as well as redshift and luminosity distributions for the background sources .",
    "we shall compare our theoretical expectations with data for the extended medium - sensitivity survey ( emss ) , which will briefly be presented in section [ emss ] .",
    "our main results are described in section [ results ] .",
    "these are compatible with a similar independent investigation of cooray @xcite , but do not agree with the claimed @xmath7-dependence of bartelmann et al .",
    "possible sources of this conflict will be indicated . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we summarize and discuss future prospects for tighter constraints in the @xmath2-plane .",
    "as for any scattering situation , the concept of cross - sections is basic in statistical lensing .    consider a source at redshift @xmath10 and distance @xmath11 , as well as a lens a distance @xmath12 ( we always use angular diameter distances ) .",
    "we are interested in lensing events characterized by a set of lensing properties , @xmath13 , of this gravitational lens system . in this paper",
    "we shall consider especially lensing events in which a galaxy behind a cluster lens is seen as an arc with a length - to - width ratio @xmath14 , larger than some given value @xmath15 .",
    "for a given lens at distance @xmath12 , the _ cross section _",
    "@xmath16 for the properties @xmath13 is by definition the area of the source sphere of radius @xmath11 , within which a source has to be located in order to be imaged with property @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient to also introduce the corresponding cross section @xmath17 in the lens plane by a simple rescaling : @xmath18 .",
    "consider next a distribution of lenses ( deflectors ) with number density @xmath19 at redshift @xmath20 .",
    "the _ optical depth _",
    "@xmath21 for property @xmath13 is defined to be the probability that a given source at redshift @xmath10 to undergo a lensing event with property @xmath13 .",
    "this is equal to the fraction of the entire source sphere of radius @xmath11 which is covered by the cross sections @xmath16 ( the cross - sections are in practice not overlapping ) : @xmath22 here , @xmath23 denotes the proper volume per unit redshift . for a friedmann universe we have , in standard notation ,",
    "@xmath24 with @xmath25 where @xmath26    in connection with the geometrical factor ( [ eq : dvdz ] ) in the integral ( [ eq : depth ] ) we recall that the angular diameter distance @xmath27 for a friedmann universe is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a curvature parameter and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the dependence of @xmath23 on the cosmological parameters is one of several sources for such a dependence of the optical depth .",
    "others are implicit in the cross - sections and the lens distributions .",
    "astrophysical uncertainties of these quantities limit attempts to exact cosmological parameters from lensing statistics .    inserting ( [ eq : dvdz ] ) into ( [ eq : depth ] ) , the optical depth can be expressed more simply in terms of the cross - section relative to the lens sphere : @xmath36 simple applications of this formula can be found in the early papers on lensing statistics .",
    "( see also @xcite , especially chapters 11 and 12 . )",
    "we now consider in more detail the statistics of arcs produced by cluster lenses .",
    "let @xmath37 be the comoving number density of clusters at redshift @xmath38 in the mass interval @xmath39 about @xmath40 .",
    "the cross - section for the property that a background galaxy at redshift @xmath20 behind a cluster of mass @xmath40 at redshift @xmath38 is seen as an arc with length - to - width ratio larger than @xmath15 will be denoted by @xmath41 . in terms of these quantities the optical depth ( [ eq : opticaldepth ] ) is given by @xmath42    singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) are the simplest lens models we shall use . for these",
    "the ratio @xmath14 coincides with the magnification @xmath43 , and the cross - section is @xcite @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the ( constant ) one - dimensional velocity dispersion , and @xmath46 the angular diameter distance from the lens to the source .",
    "for any magnitude limited sample of sources , the number of lensed sources is larger than it would be in an unbiased sample , because lensing brightens into the sample sources that would otherwise not be detected .",
    "this is , for example , a particularly pronounced effect in quasar lensing surveys , because the faint end of the quasar luminosity function rises steeply .",
    "taking the amplification bias into account , the lensing probability ( [ eq : clusterdepth ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath47 where the first factor under the integral is the integrand in ( [ eq : clusterdepth ] ) and the bias factor @xmath48 , as a function of the apparent source magnitude @xmath49 and the redshifts @xmath10 , @xmath20 , can be expressed as follows : let @xmath50 denote the unlensed number counts of sources , which agrees in practice with the _ observed _ number counts .",
    "then @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the probability distribution for the magnification of the apparent magnitude of lensed images .",
    "since @xmath53 , the latter is simply related to the magnification probability distribution @xmath54 . for a sis model we have @xmath55 @xmath50 is simply related to the luminosity function of the source population , for which a schechter form is often adopted .    in optical arc searches only galaxies brighter than some limiting apparent magnitude @xmath56 are counted . for a comparison of theory with observation",
    "we must include this observational selection in ( [ eq : prob ] ) and ( [ eq : bias ] ) .",
    "details of how this was implemented are described in @xcite .",
    "for the numerical evaluation of ( [ eq : prob ] ) and the corresponding giant arc statistics we need explicit knowledge of cross - sections , the differential comoving number density @xmath57 of clusters , and the distribution @xmath58 of the source galaxies . these quantities are , unfortunately ,",
    "not well - known .",
    "we have used three simple lens models , namely isothermal spheres with vanishing and positive core radii , and also the universal density profile proposed by navarro , frenk and white @xcite . for isothermal models",
    "we need the velocity dispersion @xmath45 that enters in the cross - section with the fourth power ( see ( [ eq : sis ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath45 depends on the cluster mass as well as on the cluster redshift @xmath38 . for the @xmath38-dependence",
    "we adopt the one of the spherical collapse model , while the @xmath40-dependence is derived from empirical correlations , using in particular the correlation between @xmath45 and the cluster temperature @xcite .",
    "( as expected from the virial theorem , the temperature is strongly correlated with the mass , @xmath59 . )    for @xmath57 we use the press - schechter formula @xcite .",
    "this is based on a mixture of statistical reasoning , linear perturbation theory , and the spherical collapse model .",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated that the press - schechter expression provides a much better description than could be expected .",
    "one of the assumptions that goes into its derivation is that the smoothed density field is gaussian",
    ". the function @xmath57 is essentially determined by the rms density fluctuations @xmath60 of _ linear _ theory .",
    "( for textbook treatments , see @xcite . ) the @xmath38-dependence of @xmath60 is then equal to the one of the growing mode of linear perturbation theory , @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be expressed in terms of the power spectrum of the density fluctuation in linear theory .",
    "for the latter we use the cdm transfer function given by bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite , and assume that the initial fluctuations are adiabatic and nearly scale free .",
    "the normalization parameter @xmath63 is taken from @xcite .",
    "uncertainties of this parameter , as well as its dependence on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , are critical , since @xmath63 enters exponentially in the press - schechter formula .    for the source distribution of galaxies",
    "we make use of the present knowledge based on the hubble deep field ( hdf ) .",
    "the deep exposure of this survey is important for our analysis .",
    "unfortunately , the redshift distribution is not precisely known , since a detailed spectroscopy of about 900 faint sources in the sample is impossible . there exist , however , two photometric redshift catalogs that were obtained by analyzing the observations in four broadband filters .",
    "we are always using the catalog in @xcite which is based on spectral template fitting .    as a result of large k - corrections ,",
    "the luminosity function is not well - known , and can not be used for determining the amplification bias .",
    "our method of treating this is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the previous discussion should make it amply clear that we have to live with substantial uncertainties .",
    "hopefully , these will be reduced in the near future .",
    "in the next section we shall compare our theoretical expectations with the results of a ccd imaging survey of gravitational lensing selected from the einstein observatory extended medium - sensitivity survey ( emss ) .",
    "the latter is a large and sensitive x - ray catalog and has been studied by a number of groups , including followed up observations using the rosat or asca satellites .",
    "presently , about 100 emss sources are classified as clusters .    in @xcite",
    "a subsample was selected for an arc survey , using the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope , and also the cfht for specific observations .",
    "it should be emphasized that the emss is not strictly flux limited , since the detection of sources was optimized for high surface brightness .",
    "therefore , more extended clusters with lower surface brightness , especially relatively close ones , may have been missed . moreover , at high redshifts only the most luminous clusters can be seen .",
    "since these are likely to be more massive , the lensing fraction is expected to become larger . for these reasons clusters in the redshift range @xmath64 , and surface brightness @xmath65 erg / s in the energy band @xmath66 kev are most suitable for a comparison with theoretical expectations .",
    "the subsample selected in @xcite contains 21 such clusters .",
    "( this corresponds to about 1300 such clusters over the entire sky . ) among these there are 6 clusters with giant arcs satisfying the following criteria : ( i ) the length - to - width ratio @xmath14 of the arc is @xmath67 .",
    "( ii ) the magnitude in the v - band satisfies @xmath68 . ( actually , @xmath69 was not always measured ; in those cases @xmath70 was adopted , which should be about the same . ) the 6 clusters in the limited area of the sample scale to about 360 over the entire sky , and the chance that a cluster in the specified range of @xmath38 and @xmath71 contains",
    "an arc is roughly 0.3 .",
    "so far the statistics are poor , but with the new satellites chandra and xmm the situation should soon improve .",
