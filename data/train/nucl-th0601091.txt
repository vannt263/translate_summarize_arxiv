    "the study of collective modes in nuclei provide very important information for understanding the structural and bulk properties of nuclear systems .",
    "for example , the isovector giant dipole ( ivgdr ) mode is sensitive to the symmetry energy , the centroid energy @xmath0 of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( isgmr ) is related to the value of the incompressibility modulus @xmath2 of symmetric nuclear matter @xcite , and low lying collective states give a clue on the nuclear shell structure .",
    "these quantities are important ingredients not only for the description of finite nuclei but also for the study of heavy - ion collisions , supernovae and neutron stars .",
    "recent developments in high precision experimental facilities make it possible to measure the centroid energy of the isgmr with an error of @xmath3 mev @xcite .",
    "using the approximate relation @xmath4 and , for example , the recent experimental value of @xmath5 mev for the isgmr in @xmath6 , one has an error of @xmath7 mev for @xmath8 mev .",
    "this enhanced precision calls for a critical accuracy check at the side of the the theoretical calculations with the goal that the error in the calculated value of @xmath0 is less than the experimental error .",
    "the basic theory for the microscopic description of different modes of giant resonances is the hartree - fock(hf ) based random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "although this approach is conceptually well understood , actual calculations make compromises for reasons of simplicity or numerical expense .",
    "one can hardly avoid limitations in the numerical basis and rpa phase space . furthermore , most of the presently available hf - rpa calculations omit the painful to evaluate pieces of the rpa residual interaction , namely its spin - orbit and/or coulomb parts .",
    "we will call that the self - consistency violation ( scv ) in the following .",
    "it is obvious that a very accurate calculation within hf - rpa demands a sufficiently complete basis and in particular self - consistency , i.e. , using exactly the same pieces in the residual interaction that have been used in the underlying hf calculation .",
    "unfortunately , apart from some fully self - consistent calculations @xcite , most existing hf - rpa calculations are contaminated by scv .",
    "first assessments on the effects of scv on the strength functions of giant resonances were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , results of elaborate studies of the effects of scv on the constrained energy ( @xmath9 ) and scaling energy ( @xmath10 ) have been reported only for the isgmr .",
    "it is to be noted that the full self - consistent values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 were obtained using the constrained hartree - fock ( chf ) approach .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that the scv concerning spin - orbit and coulomb interactions may cause an error in @xmath9 of the isgmr which becomes larger than 1 mev , i.e. as large as 5 times the experimental error .",
    "this calls for a systematic assessment of the effects of scv on the excitation energies of other modes as well .",
    "recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , fully self - consistent calculations of strength function were reported and the shift of the peak of the isgmr strength function due to scv has been discussed for @xmath11 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of scv has been assessed for the ivgdr in @xmath12 using the fully self - consistent approach of small amplitude time dependent hartree - fock method .",
    "we will continue here with discussing a greater variety of modes , namely the sequence of isoscalar and isovector multi - pole resonances in the range @xmath1 and a few examples from low lying collective states . before attacking the main task , it is worthwhile to put the various sources of uncertainties into perspective .",
    "the hf - rpa method optimizes the modes in the space of one - particle - one - hole ( @xmath13 ) excitations .",
    "correlations , i.e. @xmath14 and higher structures are not accounted for explicitly .",
    "such correlations have been very much discussed in the past , for reviews see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the main effect is a collisional broadening of the strength distributions .",
    "this can be accompanied by a certain shift of the resonance peak position which grows with excitation energy and can reach orders of 1 mev for the rather high lying isovector modes ( in the range above 20 mev ) . however , the skyrme forces employed in nuclear hf and rpa calculations are effective forces which incorporate already a great deal of correlations @xcite .",
    "this reduces the correlation effects on the peak positions @xcite .",
    "we adopt the view that the net effect remains of order of a tenth of mev for modes with moderate excitation energy around and below 15 mev . a second crucial aspect concerns limitations within the hf - rpa approach itself .",
    "there are two major questions : the size of the rpa phase space and the handling of the particle continuum .",
    "we take care to use a sufficiently large expansion basis such that peak positions have converged to uncertainties below 0.1 mev .",
    "the artificial discretization of the continuum has very little effect on the average peak positions but limits the spectral resolution with which one can reliably compute the strength distributions @xcite .",
    "we use a large simulation box and properly adapted smoothing width .",
    "after all , there remain the effects of scv to be studied .",
    "we demonstrate the accuracy of our fully self - consistent hf based rpa calculations of the strength functions of giant resonances by comparing ( i ) the rpa results with the corresponding ones of chf for the case of the isgmr and ( ii ) the total energy weighted strengths with the corresponding energy weighted sum rules ( ewsr ) .",
    "we calculate the strength function , @xmath15 following the fully self - consistent method based on @xmath16 representation described in ref . @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ ewg ] ) , @xmath17 is the rpa ground state and the sum is over all rpa excited states @xmath18 with the corresponding excitation energy @xmath19 . the scattering operator @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 for monopole , quadrupole and octopole , respectively .",

    "the correction @xmath39 , which arises because of the difference in the profiles of the neutrons and protons density distribution ( ie . , since @xmath40 ) , is given by , @xmath414\\pi r^2 dr}{\\int g_l(r)\\rho(r ) 4\\pi r^2 dr }   .\\ ] ]    the fully self - consistent moment @xmath42 for the isgmr can also be calculated using the constrained hartree - fock method @xcite , @xmath43 where the mean square radius @xmath44 and the energies @xmath45 are obtained using the solution of the constrained hamiltonian @xmath46 .",

    "this can be understood because the effect of the omission of the ph spin - orbit interaction is expected to show up prominently only for the spin unsaturated nuclei like @xmath78 and @xmath76 here .",
    "hence , for the spin closed @xmath12 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 nuclei , the effects of violation of spin - orbit interaction are very small . on the other hand",

    "[ tab01 ] , we give for @xmath80 and @xmath6 the values of @xmath47 , @xmath81 and @xmath42 obtained from the fully self - consistent hf - rpa calculations ( sc ) along with those values obtained from calculations where self - consistency is violated due to the omission of ph spin - orbit ( ls ) and ph coulomb ( co ) interactions .",
    "comparison of the @xmath47 values calculated in fully self - consistent rpa with the ewsr obtained from eq .",
    "( [ coneq1 ] ) ( given in column 3 ) shows that the rpa values are smaller than the corresponding ewsr values by less than 0.3% .",
    "the violations of self - consistency ( ls or co ) has little effect on values of @xmath47 ( 0.04% ) while the effects of scv are considerably larger in @xmath42 and @xmath81 which mainly cause the shift in the giant resonance energies .",
    "this shows that obtaining a value of @xmath47 in a rpa calculation which is very close to the ewsr does not indicate an accurate and fully self - consistent implementation of hf based rpa theory ( see also @xcite ) . in theoretical study of giant resonances , the evaluation of the strength function @xmath82",
    "is needed to compute the energy moments ( [ coneq3 ] ) and hence the centroid energy , constrained energy , etc .",
    "therefore , it is worth seeing how the strength function as such gets affected by the self consistency violation . in fig . 1",
    ", we display the variation of the @xmath82 with energy e for isoscalar excitations of different multi - polarities ( @xmath1 ) , for the nucleus @xmath83 as a representative case .",
    "we have smoothened all the strength functions by a lorentzian with a smearing parameter @xmath84 mev ( see eq .",
    "( [ smear ] ) ) in order to wipe out artefacts from the discretization of the continuum and to provide a smooth curve for better comparison of the effects of scv in @xmath82 . in the top panel of fig .",
    "1 we have three curves for the isgmr ( l=0,t=0 )  the fully self - consistent ( sc ) ( solid line ) result , with violation for ph spin - orbit interaction in rpa ( ls ) ( dashed line ) and the result with violation of ph coulomb interaction in rpa ( co ) ( open circle ) .",
    "all these three curves have similar single - peaked structure .",
    "but it is significant to notice that the violation of ls has pushed the peak to a higher energy by almost by 0.7 mev , whereas the position of the peak of the curve has moved toward the lower energy side by around 0.4 mev due to the self - consistency violation for the coulomb interaction .",
    "this implies that the self consistency violation may cause an uncertainty in the calculated value of the centroid energy @xmath0 of isgmr for @xmath83 which is twice in magnitude compared to the experimental one .",
    "this uncertainty , as we have discussed above , would impose an error of about 20 mev in the prediction of the value of @xmath2 .",
    "since the effects of ls and co violations are opposite to each other , there would be a partial cancellation if one does not take both of the ph ls and co interactions simultaneously in the rpa calculations .",
    "for the isoscalar giant dipole ( l=1,t=0 ) resonance ( isgdr ) , the effects of neglecting the coulomb and spin - orbit terms in the ph interaction are similar to those for isgmr .",
    "violation of ls leads to a push of the peak of @xmath82 toward a higher energy whereas the violation of co pulls the peak to a lower energy .",
    "but the magnitude of the shift of the peak is much smaller in comparison with the isgmr .",
    "specifically , the ph coulomb interaction shows very little effect .",
    "we display similar curves for the higher multi - polarities , l=2 and 3 , in the lower two panels .",
    "a shift of the position of the peak of @xmath82 is observed once we neglect either the ph coulomb or spin - orbit interactions in the rpa calculation . in both cases of the quadrupole and octopole giant resonances ,",
    "the effect of the violation of self consistency acts in the same direction which is in contrary to the isgmr and isgdr cases .",
    "therefore , the total shift in the peak energy of @xmath82 will be very significant if one omits both coulomb and spin - orbit ph interactions in the rpa calculations .",
    "note also the significant shifts in the energies and strengths of the low lying isoscalar @xmath85 states due to scv .    in fig .",
    "2 , we plot the strength functions for the isovector modes for @xmath6 in the same way as we have done in fig . 1 for the isoscalar mode .",
    "here we have used in the calculations the same parameters as those taken for the isoscalar modes except for the smearing parameter @xmath86 mev for the isovector giant monopole resonance ( ivgmr ) .",
    "it is clear from the figure that in the isovector modes ( for all considered multi - polarities ) the strength functions are almost insensitive to the self consistency violation due to the omission of the ph spin - orbit interaction in the rpa calculation . on the other hand",
    ", the absence of the ph coulomb interaction in the rpa calculation pushes the strength function significantly toward lower energy and this is most prominent in the isovector dipole mode where the shift is around 0.4 mev .    in table",
    "[ tab2 ] , we present , for a wide range of nuclei , the self consistent centroid energies @xmath87 and their shifts @xmath88 and @xmath89 due to the self - consistency violations for ph spin - orbit and coulomb interactions in the rpa calculations , respectively .",
    "we have given results for different multi - polarities ( @xmath90 and 3 ) for both the isoscalar and the isovector modes .",
    "it is evident from the table that for isoscalar modes , the effect of ls or co violations are most prominent for monopole resonance which are almost 2 to 3 times larger than those for the other multi - polarities .",
    "note that if we drop the ph ls and co interactions simultaneously in the rpa calculations for @xmath6 isgmr , the shift of the centroid energy is @xmath91 mev which is comparable to the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the effects of the ls and co self - consistency violations are found to be somewhat smaller for @xmath92 and 3 in comparison with the isgmr for all of these nuclei .",
    "but for the @xmath92 and 3 modes , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are found to be of the same sign .",
    "therefore , their combined effect on the centroid energy is significant .",
    "the scv associated with the coloumb interaction ( in the rpa level ) affects @xmath0 considerably in the dipole and monopole modes of the isovector channel .",
    "finally , we have checked the effect of scv on low lying ( isoscalar ) collective states .",
    "test cases were the lowest @xmath93 in @xmath67zr and the lowest @xmath94 in @xmath6 .",
    "the low lying states are much more sensitive to the size of the rpa phase space .",
    "we have used here an expansion basis up to about 2000 mev to ensure sufficient convergence .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "the effects are of the same order as found for the giant resonances",
    ". however , for these low lying states a mismatch of about 0.5 mev is large compared to the total excitation energy .",
    "a fully consistent calculation is compulsory for studying spectra in that energy range .",
    "in summary , we have carried out highly accurate fully self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) based random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations for the strength functions of isoscalar and isovector @xmath1 modes in a wide range of nuclei .",
    "we have quantified very accurately the effects of self - consistency violations in the calculations of the energies of giant resonances of nuclei within the hf based rpa .",
    "we have studied the cases of scv due to the omission of the spin - orbit ( ls ) or / and coulomb ( co ) ph interactions and mainly focus on their effects on the centroid energy @xmath0 .",
    "here we consider both isoscalar and isovector modes of multi - polarities @xmath1 .",
    "it is found , for the wide range of nuclei considered here , that the effects of violations of self - consistency due to the ph ls or co interactions are most significant for the isgmr .",
    "for the isgmr , the absence of the ph ls interaction tends to increase @xmath0 , whereas the violation due to ph co interaction decreases @xmath0 . for the spin unsaturated nuclei ( such as @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) , the shift in @xmath0 is robust ( @xmath97 mev ) which is almost 5 times larger than the experimental uncertainty . for other higher multi - polarities , the individual effect of the ph ls and co interactions are somewhat smaller than those for the isgmr .",
    "but for the quadrupole and octopole modes , the ls and co self - consistency violations both tends to reduce the centroid energy .",
