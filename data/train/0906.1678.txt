    "the dynamics of the genetic composition of populations evolving under recombination has been a long - standing subject of research .",
    "the traditional models assume random mating , non - overlapping generations ( meaning discrete time ) , and populations so large that stochastic fluctuations may be neglected and a law of large numbers ( or infinite - population limit ) applies .",
    "even this highly idealised setting leads to models that are notoriously difficult to treat and solve , namely , to large systems of coupled , nonlinear difference equations . here , the nonlinearity is due to the random mating of the partner individuals involved in sexual reproduction .    elucidating the underlying structure and finding solutions to these equations",
    "has been a challenge to theoretical population geneticists for nearly a century now .",
    "the first studies go back to jennings  @xcite in 1917 and robbins  @xcite in 1918 . building on @xcite",
    ", robbins solved the dynamics for two diallelic loci ( to be called sites from now on ) and gave an explicit formula for the ( haplo)type frequencies as functions of time .",
    "geiringer  @xcite investigated the general recombination model for an arbitrary number of loci and for arbitrary ` recombination distributions ' ( meaning collections of probabilities for the various partitionings of the sites that may occur during recombination ) in 1944 .",
    "she was the first to state the general form of the solution of the recombination equation ( as a convex combination of all possible products of certain marginal frequencies derived from the initial population ) and developed a method for the recursive evaluation of the corresponding coefficients .",
    "this simplifies the calculation of the type frequencies at any time compared to the direct evaluation through successive iteration of the dynamical system .",
    "even though she worked out the method for the general case in principle , its evaluation becomes quite involved for more than three sites .",
    "her work was followed by bennett  @xcite in 1954 .",
    "he introduced a multilinear transformation of the type frequencies to certain functions that he named _",
    "principal components_. they correspond to linear combinations of certain correlation functions that transform the dynamical system ( exactly ) into a linear one .",
    "the new variables decay independently and geometrically for all times , whence they decouple and diagonalise the dynamics .",
    "they therefore provide an elegant solution in principle , but the price to be paid is that the coefficients of the transformation must be constructed via recursions that involve the parameters of the recombination model .",
    "bennett worked this method out for up to six sites , but did not give an explicit method for an arbitrary number of sites .",
    "the approach was later completed within the systematic framework of genetic algebras , where it became known as _",
    "haldane linearisation _",
    ", compare @xcite .",
    "but , in fact , bennett s program may be completed outside this abstract framework , as was shown by dawson  @xcite , who derived a general and explicit recursion for the coefficients of the principal components .",
    "however , the proofs are somewhat technical and do not reveal the underlying mathematical structure .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to provide a more systematic , but still elementary , approach that exploits the inherent ( multi)linear and combinatorial structure of the problem  at least for one particular , but biologically relevant , special case , which will now be described .",
    "our special case is obtained by the restriction to single crossovers , which leads to what we call _ single - crossover recombination _ ( scr ) .",
    "this is the extreme case of the biological phenomenon of _ interference _ , and describes the situation where a crossover event completely inhibits any other crossover event in the same generation , at least within the genomic region considered .",
    "surprisingly , the corresponding dynamics in _ continuous _ time can be solved in closed form  @xcite .",
    "again , a crucial ingredient is a transformation to certain correlation functions ( or linkage disequilibria ) that linearise and diagonalise the system .",
    "luckily , in this case , the corresponding coefficients are independent of the recombination parameters , and the transformation is available explicitly .    motivated by this result , we now investigate the analogous single - crossover dynamics in discrete time .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first describe the discrete - time model and the general framework ( section  [ sec : prelim ] ) and then recapitulate the essentials of the _ continuous - time _ model and its solution ( section  [ scrconti ] ) .",
    "section  [ scrdiscrete ] returns to discrete time .",
    "we first analyse explicitly the cases of two , three , and four sites . for two and three sites ,",
    "the dynamics is analogous to that in continuous time ( and , in particular , available in closed form ) , but differs from then on .",
    "this is because a certain linearity present in continuous time is now lost .",
    "the transformations used in continuous time are therefore not sufficient to both linearise _ and _ diagonalise the discrete - time dynamics .",
    "they do , however , lead to a _",
    "linearisation _ ; this is worked out in sections  [ sec : subsys ]  and  [ sec : comm ] .",
    "the resulting linear system has a triangular structure that can be diagonalised in a second step in a recursive way ( section  [ sec : diagonal ] ) .",
    "we summarise and discuss our results in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "an explicit example is worked out in the appendix .",
    "let us briefly recall the recombination model described in @xcite and the special notation introduced there , as the remainder of this paper critically depends on it .",
    "a chromosome ( of length @xmath0 , say ) is represented as a linear arrangement of the @xmath0 _ sites _ of the set @xmath1 .",
    "sites are discrete positions on a chromosome that may be interpreted as gene or nucleotide positions . a set @xmath2 collects the possible elements ( such as alleles or nucleotides ) at site @xmath3 . for convenience ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to _ finite _ sets @xmath2 in this paper , though much of the theory can be extended to the case that each @xmath2 is a locally compact space , which can be of importance for applications in quantitative genetics .",
    "type _ is now defined as a sequence @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the ( finite ) _ type space_.    recombination events take place at the so - called _ links _ between neighbouring sites , collected into the set @xmath6 , where link @xmath7 is the link between sites @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "since we only consider single crossovers here , each individual event yields an exchange of the sites either before or after the respective link between the two types involved .",
    "a recombination event at link @xmath9 that involves @xmath10 and @xmath11 thus results in the types @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with both pairs considered as _",
    "unordered_.    although one is ultimately interested in the stochastic process defined by recombination acting on populations of finite size , compare  @xcite and references therein , we restrict ourselves to the deterministic limit of infinite population size here , also known as",
    "_ infinite population limit _ ( ipl ) .",
    "consequently , we are not looking at the individual dynamics , but at the induced dynamics on the probability distribution on the type space @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the convex space of all possible probability distributions on @xmath5 .",
    "as @xmath5 is finite , a probability distribution can be written as a vector @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the relative frequency of type @xmath17 in the population .",
    "let us look at the time evolution of the relative frequencies @xmath18 of types @xmath19 when starting from a known initial distribution @xmath20 of the population at time @xmath21 .",
    "in discrete time , it is given by the following collection of _ recombination equations _ for all @xmath22 : @xmath23 where the coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath25 , are the probabilities for a crossover at link @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , we must have @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is assumed from now on without loss of generality ( when @xmath30 , the set @xmath31 can be considered as a space for an effective site that comprises @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) . when the @xmath24 do not sum to @xmath34 ,",
    "the remainder is the probability that no crossover occurs , which is taken care of by the last term in the equation .",
    "moreover , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) denotes the largest integer below ( the smallest above ) @xmath26 and the star @xmath37 at site @xmath3 stands for @xmath2 , and thus indicates marginalisation over site @xmath3 .",
    "an important step to solve the large nonlinear coupled system of equations lies in its reformulation in a more compact way with the help of certain recombination operators . to construct them , we need the canonical projection operator @xmath38 , defined by @xmath39 as usual .",
    "likewise , for any index set @xmath40 , the projector @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 .",
    "we will frequently use @xmath43 these can be understood as _ cut - and - forget _ operators since they ` cut out ' the leading and the trailing segment of a type @xmath17 , respectively , and ` forget ' about the rest .",
    "the projectors induce linear mappings from @xmath14 to @xmath44 by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the preimage under @xmath47 and @xmath48 indicates composition of mappings .",
    "the operation @xmath49 ( not to be confused with a multiplication sign ) is known as the pullback of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , @xmath51 is simply the marginal distribution of @xmath50 with respect to the sites of @xmath52 .",
    "now consider recombination at link @xmath26 , performed on the entire population .",
    "since the resulting population consists of randomly chosen leading segments relinked with randomly chosen trailing segments , it may be described through the ( elementary ) recombination operator ( or _ recombinator _ for short ) @xmath53 , defined by @xmath54 with @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the product measure and reflects the independent combination of both marginals @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "note that the recombinators are structural operators that do not depend on the recombination probabilities .",
    "before we rewrite the recombination equations in terms of these recombinators , let us recall some of their elementary properties , see  @xcite for proofs .",
    "first of all , the elementary recombinators @xmath59 are idempotents and commute with one another on @xmath60 .",
    "this permits the consistent definition of _ composite recombinators _",
    "@xmath61 for arbitrary subsets @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , one has @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "[ recoprop ] on @xmath60 , the elementary recombinators are commuting idempotents . for @xmath65 ,",
    "they satisfy @xmath66 likewise , for @xmath67 , @xmath68    furthermore , the composite recombinators satisfy @xmath69 for arbitrary @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71    these properties can be understood intuitively as well : says that recombination at or after link @xmath26 does not affect the marginal frequencies at sites before @xmath26 , whereas the marginal frequencies at the sites after @xmath26 change into the product measure ( and vice versa in  ) .",
    "furthermore , repeated recombination at link @xmath26 does not change the situation any further ( recombinators are idempotents ) and the formation of the product measure with respect to @xmath72 links does not depend on the order in which the links are affected . as we shall see below , these properties of the recombinators are crucial for finding a solution of the scr dynamics , both in continuous and in discrete time .",
    "let us briefly review the scr dynamics in _ continuous _ time , as its structure will be needed below .",
    "making use of the recombinators introduced above , the dynamics ( in the ipl ) is described by a system of differential equations for the time evolution of the probability distribution ( or measure ) , starting from an initial condition @xmath20 at @xmath21 .",
    "it reads  @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is now the _ rate _ for a crossover at link @xmath26 . though describes a coupled system of nonlinear differential equations , the closed solution for its cauchy ( or initial value ) problem is available  @xcite :    [ thm : reco - cont ] the solution of the recombination equation @xmath75 with initial value @xmath76 can be given in closed form as @xmath77 with the coefficient functions @xmath78 these are non - negative functions , which satisfy @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath71    the coefficient functions can be interpreted probabilistically .",
    "given an individual sequence in the population , @xmath81 is the probability that the set of links that have seen at least one crossover event until time @xmath82 is precisely the set @xmath83 .",
    "note that the product structure of the @xmath81 implies independence of links , a decisive feature of the single - crossover dynamics in continuous time , as we shall see later on . by",
    ", @xmath84 is always a convex combination of the probability measures @xmath85 with @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , given an initial condition @xmath86 , the entire dynamics takes place on the closed simplex ( within @xmath14 ) that is given by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 denotes the convex hull of @xmath89 .",
    "it is surprising that a closed solution for the dynamics   can be given explicitly , and this suggests the existence of an underlying linear structure  @xcite , which is indeed the case and well known from similar equations , compare  @xcite . in the context of the formulation with recombinators",
    ", it can be stated as follows , compare  @xcite for details .",
    "[ thm : linear ] let @xmath90 be a family of non - negative functions with @xmath91 , valid for any partition @xmath92 of the set @xmath93 and all @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .",
    "assume further that these functions satisfy @xmath96 for any @xmath97 and @xmath94 . if @xmath98 and @xmath99 , one has the identity @xmath100 which is then satisfied for all @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath71    here , the upper index specifies the respective set of links .",
    "so far , theorem  [ thm : linear ] depends crucially on the product structure of the functions @xmath102 , but we will show later how this assumption can be relaxed . in any case , the coefficient functions @xmath81 of satisfy the conditions of theorem  [ thm : linear ] .",
    "the result then means that the recombinators act linearly along solutions   of the recombination equation  . denoting @xmath103 as the flow of eq .",
    ", theorem  [ thm : linear ] thus has the following consequence .",
    "[ coro1 ] on @xmath14 , the forward flow of @xmath75 commutes with all recombinators , which means that @xmath104 holds for all @xmath94 and all @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath71    the conventional approach to solve the recombination dynamics consists in transforming the type frequencies to certain functions which diagonalise the dynamics , see @xcite and references therein for more .",
    "from now on , we will call these functions _ principal components _ after bennett  @xcite . for the single - crossover dynamics in continuous time",
    ", they have a particularly simple structure : they are given by certain correlation functions , or _ linkage disequilibria _ ( lde ) , which play an important role in biological applications .",
    "they have a counterpart at the level of operators on @xmath14 .",
    "namely , let us define _ lde operators _ on @xmath14 as linear combinations of recombinators via @xmath105 so that the inverse relation is given by @xmath106 due to the combinatorial mbius inversion formula , compare  @xcite .",
    "let us note for further use that , by eq .   in proposition  [ recoprop",
    "] , @xmath107 .",
    "note also that , for a probability measure @xmath50 on @xmath5 , @xmath108 is a signed measure on @xmath5 ; in particular , it need not be positive .",
    "the ldes are given by certain _ components _ of the @xmath108  see  @xcite for more . in the continuous - time single - crossover setting , it was shown in @xcite that , if @xmath109 is the solution  , the @xmath110 satisfy @xmath111 which is a _ decoupled _ system of homogeneous linear differential equations , with the standard exponential solution .",
    "that is , the lde operators both linearise and diagonalise the system , and the ldes are thus , at the same time , principal components .",
    "a straightforward calculation now reveals that the solution   can be rewritten as @xmath112 where the new coefficient functions are given by @xmath113    at this point , it is important to notice the rather simple structure of the lde operators , which do not depend on the crossover rates .",
    "moreover , the transformation between recombinators and lde operators is directly given by the mbius formula , see eqs .   and .",
    "this is a significant simplification in comparison with previous results , compare @xcite , where the coefficients of the transformation generally depend on the crossover rates and must be determined recursively .",
    "below , we shall see that the scr dynamics in _ continuous _ time is indeed a special case , and that the above results can not be transferred directly to the corresponding dynamics in _ discrete _ time . nevertheless , part of the continuous - time structure prevails and offers a useful entry point for the solution of the discrete - time counterpart .",
    "employing recombinators , the scr equations   in discrete time with a given initial distribution @xmath76 can be compactly rewritten as @xmath114 as indicated , the nonlinear operator of the right - hand side of is denoted by @xmath115 from now on .",
    "we aim at a closed solution of , namely for @xmath116 with @xmath117 . based on the result for the continuous - time model , the solution is expected to be of the form    @xmath118    with non - negative @xmath119 , @xmath62 , @xmath120 , describing the ( unknown ) coefficient functions arising from the dynamics .",
    "this representation of the solution was first stated by geiringer  @xcite .",
    "in particular , also the discrete - time dynamics takes place on the simplex @xmath121 .",
    "we are particularly interested in whether a discrete - time equivalent to corollary  [ coro1 ] exists , that is , whether all recombinators @xmath122 commute with @xmath115 .",
    "this is of importance since it would allow for a diagonalisation of the dynamics via the lde operators  . to see this ,",
    "assume for a moment that @xmath123 for all @xmath25 , and thus @xmath124 for all @xmath62 .",

    "this wishful calculation is badly smashed by the nonlinear nature of the recombinators , and the remainder of this paper is concerned with true identities that repair the damage .    to get an intuition for the dynamics in discrete time ,",
    "let us first take a closer look at the discrete - time model with two , three , and four sites .      for two sites ,",
    "one simply has @xmath129 and @xmath130 , so that only one non - trivial recombinator exists , @xmath131 , with corresponding recombination probability @xmath132 .",
    "consequently , the scr equation simplifies to @xmath133 where @xmath109 is a @xmath134-dimensional probability vector .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath135 with @xmath136 .",
    "this formula is easily verified by induction @xcite .",
    "thus , in analogy with the scr dynamics in continuous time , the solution is available in closed form , and the coefficient functions allow an analogous probabilistic interpretation .",
    "furthermore , it is easily seen that the recombinators @xmath63 and @xmath137 commute with @xmath115 and therefore with @xmath138 for all @xmath139 . for two sites",
    ", the analogue of corollary  [ coro1 ] thus holds in discrete time . as a consequence ,",
    "the lde operators from decouple and linearise the system  . at the level of the component ldes ,",
    "this is common knowledge in theoretical population genetics ; compare  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap.3 ) .",
    "similarly , the recombination equation   for three sites can be solved explicitly as well .",
    "an elementary calculation ( applying the iteration and comparing coefficients ) shows that the corresponding coefficient functions @xmath140 follow the linear recursion @xmath141 with solution @xmath142 these coefficient functions have the same probabilistic interpretation as the corresponding @xmath143 , @xmath62 , in the continuous - time model , so that @xmath119 is the probability that the links that have been involved in recombination until time @xmath82 are exactly those of the set @xmath83 .",
    "but there is a crucial difference .",
    "recall that , in continuous time , single crossovers imply _ independence _ of links , which is expressed in the product structure of the coefficient functions @xmath143 ( see  ) .",
    "this independence is lost in discrete time , where a crossover event at one link forbids any other cut at other links in the same time step .",
    "consequently , already for three sites , the coefficients of the discrete - time dynamics fail to show the product structure used in theorem  [ thm : linear ] .    but",
    "even though corollary  [ coro1 ] , concerning the forward flow of , is a consequence of theorem  [ thm : linear ] , which , in turn , is based upon the product structure of the coefficients , a short calculation reveals that @xmath144 still holds for the discrete - time model with three sites for all @xmath145 . as a consequence , just as in the case of two sites , the @xmath146 linearise _ and _ decouple the dynamics , which is well - known to the experts , see  @xcite for more .    to summarise : despite the loss of independence of links , an explicit solution of the discrete - time recombination dynamics is still available , and a linearisation and diagonalisation of the dynamics can be achieved with the methods developed for the continuous - time model , that is , a transformation to a solvable system via the @xmath146 .",
    "however , things will become more complex if we go to four sites and beyond .",
    "in particular , there is no equivalent to corollary  [ coro1 ] , i.e. , in general , the recombinators _ do not _ commute with @xmath147 , and we have to search for a new transformation that replaces , as will be explained next .",
    "the complication with four sites originates from the fact that @xmath148 , so that the property described by corollary  [ coro1 ] for continuous time is lost here .",
    "consequently , the @xmath146 fail the desired properties .",
    "in particular , one finds @xmath149 so that an explicit solution of the model can not be obtained as before .",
    "this raises the question why four sites are more difficult than three sites , even though independence of links has already been lost with three sites . to answer this , we look at the time evolution of the coefficient functions @xmath119 , @xmath62 . for this purpose ,",
    "let us return to the general model with an arbitrary number of sites .",
    "we now consider an arbitrary ( but finite ) set @xmath150 with the corresponding link set @xmath93 .",
    "for each @xmath62 , we use the following abbreviations : @xmath151 furthermore , we set @xmath152 .",
    "we then obtain    [ thm : adevelop ] for all @xmath62 and @xmath153 , the coefficient functions @xmath119 evolve according to @xmath154 with initial condition @xmath155 .",
    "geiringer @xcite already explained in words how to derive this general recursion , and illustrated it with the four - site example ; we give a proof via our operator formalism .",
    "using , the recombination equation for @xmath156 reads @xmath157 where each product term in the first sum can be calculated as @xmath158 where we use the linearity of the projectors in the first step , and eqs .   and from proposition  [ recoprop ] in the second (",
    "more precisely , we use the left parts of eqs .   and , reading them both forward and backward ) .",
    "insert this into the expression for @xmath156 and rearrange the sums for a comparison of coefficients of @xmath122 with @xmath62 .",
    "comparison of coefficients is justified by the observation that , for generic @xmath76 and generic site spaces , the vectors @xmath85 with @xmath62 are the extremal vectors of the closed simplex @xmath159 .",
    "they are the vectors that ( generically ) can not be expressed as non - trivial convex combination within the simplex , and hence the vertices of the latter ( in cases with degeneracies , one reduces the simplex in the obvious way ) . if @xmath160 , we only have @xmath161 as coefficient for @xmath162",
    "otherwise , we get additional contributions for each @xmath163 , namely , from those @xmath164 for which @xmath165 and @xmath166 , while @xmath167 and @xmath168 can be any subset of @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively . hence , the term belonging to @xmath171 reads @xmath172 and the assertion follows .",
    "@xmath71    the @xmath119 have the same probabilistic interpretation as the @xmath143   from the continuous - time model , and the above iteration can be understood intuitively as well : a type @xmath17 resulting from recombination at link @xmath26 is composed of two segments @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "these segments themselves may have been pieced together in previous recombination events already , and the iteration explains the possible cuts these segments may carry along .",
    "the first term in the product stands for the type delivering the leading segment ( which may bring along arbitrary cuts in the trailing segment ) , the second for the type delivering the trailing one ( here any leading segment is allowed ) .",
    "the term @xmath175 covers the case of no recombination .",
    "note that the above iteration is generally _ nonlinear _ , where the products stem from the fact that types recombine independently .",
    "this nonlinearity is the reason that an explicit solution can not be given as before .",
    "a notable exception is provided by recombination events that occur at links where one of the involved segments can not have been affected by previous crossovers , namely the links @xmath176 and @xmath177 . in this case ,",
    "at least one of the factors in eq .   becomes @xmath34 ( since , obviously , @xmath178 for @xmath179 and @xmath180 for @xmath181 ) and the resulting linear and triangular recursion can be solved .",
    "the coefficients for the corresponding link sets can be inferred directly ( proof via simple induction ) as @xmath182 this explains the availability of an explicit solution for the model with up to three sites , where we do not have links other than @xmath176 and/or @xmath183 , so that all corresponding coefficients can be determined explicitly . indeed ,",
    "one recovers with @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "so far , we have observed that the product structure of the coefficient functions , known from continuous time , is lost in discrete time from three sites onwards ; this reflects the dependence of links .",
    "in contrast , the linearity of the iteration is only lost from four sites onwards .",
    "the latter can be understood further by comparison of with the differential equations for the coefficients of the continuous - time model .",
    "these read : @xmath186 that is , they are linear , with solution  .",
    "note that this linear dynamics emerges from a seemingly nonlinear one , namely the analogue of  , @xmath187 however , due to the product structure of the solution , the product term in the second sum , when inserting , reduces to a single term , @xmath188 which turns into .",
    "what happens here is the following . from four sites onwards (",
    "namely , beginning with @xmath189 and a crossover at @xmath190 , and both in discrete and continuous time ) , it happens that leading and trailing segments meet that both possess at least one link that may possibly have seen a previous cut .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the dynamics of an ` infinite ' population that evolves due to recombination alone . to this end",
    ", we assumed discrete ( non - overlapping ) generations , and restricted ourselves to the case of single crossovers .",
    "previous results had shown that the corresponding single - crossover dynamics in continuous time admits a closed solution @xcite .",
    "this astonishing result is concordant with a ` hidden ' linearity in the system that is due to independence of links .",
    "the fact that crossovers at different links occur independently manifests itself in the product structure of the coefficient functions of the solution ensuing from the linear action of the nonlinear recombination operators along the solution of the recombination equation .",
    "additionally , in @xcite , a certain set of linkage disequilibria was found that linearise and diagonalise the dynamics .",
    "since the overwhelming part of the literature deals with discrete - time models , our aim was to find out whether , and to what extent , these continuous - time results carry over to single - crossover dynamics in discrete time .",
    "we could show that the discrete - time dynamics is far more complex than the continuous - time one , and , as a consequence , a closed solution can not be given .",
    "the main reason for these difficulties lies in the fact that the key feature of the continuous - time model , the independence of links , does not carry over to discrete time .",
    "this is due to interference : the occurrence of a recombination event in the discrete - time model forbids any further crossovers in the same generation . in connection with this ,",
    "the recombinators do not , in general , act linearly on the right - hand side of the recombination equation .",
    "likewise , the coefficient functions of the solution follow a nonlinear iteration that can not be solved explicitly .",
    "while geiringer  @xcite developed a skilful procedure for the generation - wise evaluation of these coefficients , we constructed a method that allows for an _ explicit _ formula valid for all times , once the coefficients of the transformation have been determined recursively for a given system .",
    "as in previous approaches , this is achieved by a transformation of the nonlinear , coupled system of equations to a linear diagonal one .",
    "this was done before by bennett  @xcite and dawson  @xcite for the more general recombination equation ( without restriction to single crossovers ) , and they presented an appropriate transformation that includes parameters that must be determined recursively .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding derivations are rather technical and fail to reveal the underlying mathematical structure .",
    "it was our aim to improve on this and add some structural insight . unlike the previous approaches , we proceeded in two steps : first linearisation followed by diagonalisation .",
    "more precisely , it turns out that the lde operators @xmath146 , which both linearise and diagonalise the continuous - time system , still _ linearise _ the discrete - time dynamics , but fail to _ diagonalise _ it for four or more loci .",
    "however , the resulting linear system may be diagonalised in a second step .",
    "this relies on linear combinations @xmath433 of the @xmath146 , with coefficients derived in a recursive manner .",
    "as it must be , the transformation agrees with the one of dawson  @xcite when translated into his framework .",
    "( note that our @xmath443 are coefficients of @xmath442 , whereas his coefficients belong to components of @xmath503 .",
    "note also that scr does _ not _ belong to the singular cases he excludes ) .",
    "it remains an interesting open problem how much of the above findings can be transferred to the general recombination model ( i.e. without the restriction to single crossovers ) , where one loses the simplifying structure of ordered partitions .",

    "hustedt for critically reading the manuscript and k. schneider for valuable suggestions to further improve it .",
    "this work was supported by dfg ( research training group bioinformatics , and dutch - german bilateral research group on mathematics of random spatial models in physics and biology ) .",
    "to illustrate the construction , let us spell out the example of five sites .",
    "we have @xmath504 and @xmath505 , the corresponding recombination probabilities @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath506 , and a given initial population @xmath76 .",

    "but since we aim at a closed solution for _ all _ @xmath82 , we use the procedure developed above . to determine the coefficients of theorem  [ thm : aexplicit ] , we have to calculate the corresponding @xmath443 and @xmath511 .",
