    "our knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the solar interior has been considerably improved by the use of measurements of the properties of the normal modes of oscillation of the sun . however , the sun s interior is far from being fully understood , and better measurements of the mode parameters will also help to better understand the mode excitation and damping mechanisms as well as the physical properties of the outer layers by better constraining the turbulence models .",
    "a large number of predicted acoustic oscillation modes , defined by their radial orders ( @xmath5 ) and their angular degrees ( @xmath6 ) , are not yet observed in the low - frequency range ( i.e. , approximately below 1800  @xmath7hz ) , because the amplitude of the acoustic modes decreases as the mode inertia increases as the frequency decreases , while the solar noise from incoherent , convective motions increases : thus the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of those modes is progressively reduced .",
    "moreover , these low - frequency p modes have very long lifetimes , as much as several years , which results in very narrow linewidths , hence precise frequency measurements .",
    "thanks to the long - duration helioseismic observations collected by the spaced - based instruments michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) @xcite and global oscillations at low frequencies ( golf ) @xcite onboard the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) spacecraft , and by the ground - based , multi - site global oscillation network group ( gong ) @xcite and birmingham solar oscillations network ( bison ) @xcite , the frequency resolution is continuously improving and the observation of lower radial - order solar p modes is becoming possible .",
    "their precise mode parameter determination is of great interest for improving our resolution throughout the solar interior because they cover a broad range of horizontal phase velocity , and thus a broad range of depths of penetration .",
    "moreover , these low - frequency modes have lower reflection points in the outer part of the sun , which make them less sensitive to the turbulence and the magnetic fields in the outer layers , where the physics is poorly understood .",
    "the usual mode - fitting analysis consists of fitting the @xmath1 individual-@xmath0 spectra of a given multiplet ( @xmath2 ) , either individually or simultaneously .",
    "such fitting methods fail to obtain reliable estimates of the mode parameters when the snr of the individual-@xmath0 spectra is low .",
    "instead , various pattern - recognition techniques have been developed in an effort to reveal the presence of modes in the low - frequency range ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in the case of spatially - resolved helioseismic data ( such as gong and mdi observations )",
    ", @xmath0-averaged spectra appeared to be a powerful tool , since for a given multiplet ( @xmath2 ) , there exist @xmath1 individual-@xmath0 spectra , which can result in an average spectrum with a snr  @xmath8 once the individual-@xmath0 spectra are corrected for the rotation- and structure - induced frequency shifts .",
    "the @xmath0-averaged spectra were employed early in the development of helioseismology by @xcite , but were replaced by fitting the @xmath0 spectra individually as the quality and the snr of the data improved .",
    "however , years later , in order to fully take advantage of the long - duration helioseismic gong and mdi instruments and reach lower frequencies in the solar oscillation spectrum , @xcite and @xcite used the @xmath0-averaged spectra corrected by the modeled solar rotation to detect new low radial - order p modes and to set upper limits on the detectability of the g modes .",
    "these authors demonstrated the potential advantage of such rotation - corrected , @xmath0-averaged spectra .",
    "we present here an adaptation of the @xmath0-averaged spectrum technique in which the @xmath0-dependent shift parameters are determined by maximizing the quality of the resulting average spectrum .",
    "the analysis is performed on long - duration time series of the spatially - resolved helioseismic gong and mdi observations of the low- and medium - angular degrees ( @xmath9 ) .",

    "the two foms return consistent mode parameters within the error bars , the difference between the two being within the @xmath18 limit for all of the mode parameters .",
    "as a test of the dependence of the measured frequencies on the fitting model used to describe the @xmath0-averaged spectra , we fitted the @xmath0-averaged spectra using three different models : an asymmetric lorenztian profile ( eq .  [ eq : mlemodel ] ) including the closest @xmath19 spatial leaks ( hereafter called _ a2 _ and used as the reference model ) ; a symmetric lorenztian profile including the @xmath19 spatial leaks ( hereafter _ s2 _ ) ; and an asymmetric lorenztian profile ( eq .  [ eq : mlemodel ] ) but omitting the neighbouring @xmath19 spatial leaks ( hereafter _ a _ ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : nunoasym_2088d ] shows the differences as a function of frequency in the 2088-day gong low frequencies estimated using the @xmath0-averaged technique between _",
    "s2 _ and _ a2 _ ( red dots ) , and between _ a _ and _ a2 _ ( black plus signs ) , in both cases _ a2 _ being the reference model . ignoring the peak asymmetry in the fitting model leads to a systematic underestimation of the mode frequency as the frequency increases , the effect becoming particularly large above @xmath10  1400  @xmath7hz ( red dots ) .",
    "the differences become much larger than @xmath18 , for example , at @xmath10  1800  @xmath7hz , the fitted frequencies between _ s2 _ and _ a2 _ are about @xmath20 apart .",
    "these results obtained for modes below 2000  @xmath7hz confirm previous observations , e.g. @xcite who analyzed low - degree modes above 2000  @xmath7hz in 805 days of golf data .    on the other hand , omitting the spatial leaks",
    "has no effect below @xmath10  1600  @xmath7hz , as they become well separated from the main peak because the corresponding mode linewidths are much smaller than their frequency separation . as the frequency increases ,",
    "the mode linewidths increase , and ignoring the spatial leaks in the fitting model of the @xmath0-averaged spectrum between about 1600 and 2000  @xmath7hz leads to an underestimation of the target mode frequency , the maximum difference occuring around 1800  @xmath7hz .",
    "the frequency separation between the target mode and the @xmath0-leaks then becomes comparable to their linewidths and the lines blend together in the @xmath0-averaged spectrum . above 2000",
    "@xmath7hz , this underestimation seems to vanish .",
    "indeed , at that frequency range , the mode linewidths are much larger than the frequency separation , and the first spatial leaks ( at least ) are totally blended into the target mode in the @xmath0-averaged spectrum , having a much lower impact on the frequency determination .",
    "however , the effect of ignoring the peak asymmetry is much larger than that from ignoring the @xmath0 leaks even in the frequency range where the @xmath0 leaks have the strongest impact .",
    "for instance , at 1800  @xmath7hz , the effect on the frequency underestimation by ignoring the mode asymmetry is about seven times larger than by ignoring the @xmath0 leaks .    as an example of the other mode parameters , the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nunoasym_2088d ] shows the differences in the extracted mode linewidths between the different fitting models .",
    "the color code is the same as for the differences in frequency represented on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nunoasym_2088d ] . ignoring the presence of the @xmath0 leaks in the fitting model leads to a 35% overestimation at most of the extracted linewidths in the low - frequency range showing a maximum mismatch around 1900  @xmath7hz .",
    "interestingly , if the @xmath0 leaks are omitted , the linewidths are underestimated below @xmath10  1600  @xmath7hz , showing a maximum 10% underestimation around 1500  @xmath7hz . on the other hand , ignoring the peak asymmetry has a very small influence on the fitted linewidths in the low - frequency range . however , above @xmath10  1800  @xmath7hz , the linewidths extracted using an asymmetric profile are systematically larger than the ones returned using a symmetric profile .",
    "the derivation of the errors of the mode central frequencies and of the @xmath15-coefficients measured from the @xmath0-averaged spectrum technique is detailed here .",
    "the @xmath0-averaged spectrum is obtained from the summation of @xmath1 spectra assumed to be with @xmath21 with 2 d.o.f statistics each having a _ different _ mean or signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "all of the individual @xmath0-spectra are independent from each other .",
