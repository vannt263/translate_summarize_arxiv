    "the backbending of @xmath0cr has been observed more than 10 years ago @xcite , but its interpretation remains controversial and challenges the existing nuclear models .",
    "shell model ( sm ) calculations have reproduced very well the yrast states of @xmath0cr @xcite , but it is difficult to provide the physical insight because the laboratory frame wavefunction does nt imply any information associated with the deformed intrinsic structure .",
    "the cranked hartree fock bogoliubov(chfb ) method is a complementary theory @xcite often used to analyze the deformed intrinsic states . according to one chfb analysis@xcite",
    ", @xmath0cr is an axial rotor up to the backbending , after that the system changes to a spherical shape .",
    "an alternative and more detailed chfb analysis @xcite shows that the backbending of the @xmath0cr is not associated with the single particle level crossing and that the intrinsic configuration remains unchanged .    the projected shell model ( psm ) @xcite is an alternative technique that mixes the best intrinsic shell model configuration with other associated particle - hole configurations .",
    "a psm analysis @xcite indicates that the backbending in @xmath0cr is due to a band crossing involving an excited 4-quasiparticle ( qp ) band with @xmath2 , which represents a configuration of broken neutron and proton pairs .",
    "unfortunately , such an explanation is not confirmed by recent sm @xcite and chfb @xcite analyses . in addition , the same psm ref .",
    "@xcite , uses the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) that provides the picture of a spherical band crossing , which in some sense is similar to the result of chfb .",
    "obviously , the above apparently conflicting explanations coming from different models need to be reinvestigated .    in the present paper",
    ", the backbending in @xmath0cr is investigated in the framework of the newly developed method called projected configuration interaction ( pci)@xcite .",
    "the pci basis is built from a set of slater determinants ( sd ) .",
    "those sds may have different shapes , including the spherical shape .",
    "hence , the nuclear states with different intrinsic shapes can be mixed by the residual interaction . by using the same sm hamiltonian ,",
    "the pci results can be directly compared with those of full shell model calculations .",
    "moreover , pci uses deformed single particle bases and therefore , the physics insight of the results can be clearly analyzed .",
    "different pci bases can be built in such a way that they reflect the nature of the intrinsics states found in previous studies , such as chfb ( or gcm ) and psm .",
    "pci wavefunctions were shown to be very good approximations to those of full sm , and they can be obtained using different bases .",
    "thereafter , overlaps among pci wavefunctions can be calculated and analyzed to determine the validity of various explanations .",
    "these features suggest that pci could shed new light on the interesting phenomenon of backbending in @xmath0cr .",
    "other models using similar techniques includes the family of vampir @xcite , and the quantum monte carlo diagonalization ( qmcd ) method@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii provides a short introduction into the basics concepts used by the pci method that would be required for an understanding of the arguments used later in the analysis .",
    "section iii is devoted to the analysis of the contribution of different intrinsics set of states to the backbending in @xmath0cr .",

    "hamiltonian assumed to have the same eigenfunctions as the spherical harmonic oscillator , @xmath5 energies are properly adjusted such that the sd with lowest energy is close to the hf vacuum . for the @xmath6-shell we use @xmath7mev , @xmath8mev , @xmath9mev and @xmath10mev . in eq .",
    "( [ sph ] ) @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the quadrupole and hexadecapole deformation parameters , @xmath13 are legendre polynomials , @xmath14 , and we take @xmath15 for the harmonic oscillator parameter @xcite .    the slater determinants can be built with deformed s.p .",
    "states . following our previous papers @xcite , the general structure of the pci basis can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is an optimal @xcite set of starting states having different deformations . assuming that these @xmath19 are found ( in what follows we skip the subscript @xmath20 to keep notation short ) , a number of relative @xmath21p-@xmath21h sds , @xmath22 , on top of each @xmath19 are added to the sd basis selected the constraint @xcite @xmath23 here @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the pci basis is then obtained by projecting the selected sds onto good angular momentum .",
    "the wavefunctions , as well as the energy levels , are obtained by solving the following generalized eigenvalue equation : @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the angular momentum projection operator , and @xmath32 is the shell model hamiltonian . in this study",
    "we take the kb3 interaction @xcite , which has been used by caurier et al in their shell model calculations of @xmath0cr @xcite .",
    "however , results similar to those reported here are provided by other interactions , such as kb3 g @xcite or gxpf1a @xcite .",
    "to get some insight into the structure of the states contributing to the backbending in @xmath0cr we chose two basic @xmath19 sds .",

    "the first , suggested by the chfb calculations , according to which the backbending in @xmath0cr can be explained without a band crossing @xcite , but by a shape changes from well deformation to spherical @xcite .",

    "such choice of @xmath42 sd would be consistent with the gcm interpretation , in which hf vacua with different deformations are included in the basis .",

    "[ cr48b](b ) , the overlaps @xmath61 are very large , at least @xmath62 . therefore , we come to the conclusion that the apparently contradictory chfb and psm explanations , actually look qualitatively equivalent one to each other .",
    "one should note , however , that the backbending described with the g.s.+c basis is quantitatively not as good as that descibed with the g.s.+a basis .",
    "the reason could be the large deformation of c basis .",
    "changing the deformation of c basis to spherical , one gets the g.s.+b basis , and the result is improved .",

    "@xcite .",
    "notice that the results obtained with bases g.s.+a and g.s.+b are almost identical , although the intrinsic bases a and b have a completely different structure .",

    "( [ hn ] ) ) . here",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 are dimensions of the pci and full ( m - scheme ) sm spaces , where @xmath71 is a very large number .",
    "however , the pci approximation can be further checked by comparing the energies as well as the be2 transition probabilities with those of the full sm calculations .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the pci energies lie 500 kev on average above the exact values , but they were calculated using less than 400 sds ( see table .",
    "[ sds ] ) , while in full sm calculations the number of the sds used is 1963461 . for the b(e2 ) calculations we used the ` canonical ' effective charges , i.e. @xmath72 for protons and @xmath73 for neutrons , which are the same as those used in refs .",
    "the be2 values obtained with pci are very close to the exact ones , except those for @xmath74 and 10 , which are slightly larger .",
    "that is very likely due to the fixed deformation we used for the selected ` g.s ' basis . as shown in fig .",
    "[ sd]b , the deformation reduces gradually as the spin increases , conclusion also supported by the chfb @xcite and the cranked nilsson - strutinsky ( cns ) @xcite calculations .",
    "therefore we overestimated the be2 values at @xmath74 and 10 .    on a final note",
    "the intrinsic states play a key role in studying the physics of the nuclear system .",
    "even if they are orthogonal , their overlap can be quite large after the angular momentum projection .",
    "here is a simple example .",

    "[ sd]a were projected on to good angular momentum assuming spherical and deformed ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) shapes , respectively .",
    "the overlap @xmath75 was calculated and plotted in fig .",
    "one can see that the deformed overlap @xmath76 is always smaller than the spherical one , indicating that the deformed intrinsic states can be more clearly defined than the spherical ones . in the low - spin region the overlaps @xmath76 are small , and the two intrinsic configurations can be easily distinguished .",
    "but at high spin , @xmath76 are much larger for both spherical and deformed cases , which means that the intrinsic states can not be clearly identified , at least for the case of @xmath0cr .",
    "in summary , the backbending in @xmath0cr has been studied with a recently developed projected configuration interaction ( pci ) method .",
    "pci uses the same realistic hamiltonians and valence spaces as the sm calculations , but only a set of properly selected sds with different deformations and associated @xmath21p-@xmath21h configurations .",
    "the backbending in @xmath0cr has been reproduced by using various pci bases , carefully selected to reflect the physics of the intrinsic states found by the chfb ( gcm ) and psm analyses of this case . using the pci capabilities of mixing these bases we show for the first time that the backbending pictures proposed by the chfb and psm methods are qualitatively equivalent .",
