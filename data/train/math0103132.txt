    "we will discover a large class of positive finite presentations of the @xmath0-braid group . roughly speaking , a presentation in this class",
    "has a set of generators determined by a connected graph with @xmath0 vertices immersed in a plane in such a way that each pair of edges intersects at most once .",
    "our class of presentations includes all known positive finite presentations such as the artin presentation@xcite , the band - generator presentation in @xcite and all of sergiescu s presentations in @xcite .",
    "our first objective is to find a ( minimal ) collection of positive relations among generators given by a graph as above so that it becomes a presentation of the @xmath0-braid groups .",
    "the semigroup of all positive words plays a crucial role in the solutions to the word problem and the conjugacy problem for the @xmath0-braid group given by garside@xcite , thurston@xcite , and elrifi - morton@xcite .",
    "their solutions are based on the property that the semigroup embeds in the whole group .",
    "birman - ko - lee s recent work@xcite also requires this embedding property in order to give a fast solution to the word problem in the band - generator presentation .",
    "our second objective is to prove that with a few exception all presentations in our class have the embedding property .",
    "the artin and the band - generator presentations are the only nontrivial exceptions .",
    "consequently these two among all presentations are natural and interesting for further study .",
    "the @xmath0-braid group @xmath1 is the group of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving automorphisms of an @xmath0 punctured plane @xmath2 that fix the set of punctures and the outside of a disk containing all punctures .",
    "it is customary to place punctures on the @xmath3-axis and equally spaced . ignoring the punctures ,",
    "such an automorphism is a homeomorphism of @xmath2 permuting the punctures and so is isotopic to the identity map of @xmath2 .",
    "a geometric braid is determined by taking the trace of the punctures under this isotopy .",
    "when the punctures are not in the customary location , there is a choice of homeomorphisms of @xmath4 that send the punctures to their customary location and a geometric braid is uniquely determined up to conjugation in this case .",
    "since the symmetric group over @xmath0 letters is naturally a quotient of @xmath1 , an automorphism that exchanges two punctures is a candidate for a generator of @xmath1 and a typical automorphism of this type can be easily depicted as an arc connecting the two punctures so the automorphism exchanges two punctures clockwise or counterclockwise inside an annulus lying along the arc .",
    "see figure [ f : string ] for an example .",
    "this type of braids will be called the _ half twist along the given arc_.    therefore by regarding the punctures as vertices and a collection of these arcs as edges , we have a graph @xmath5 immersed in @xmath2 satisfying the following properties :    1 .",
    "there are no loops ; 2 .",
    "edges have no self - intersections ; 3 .   two distinct edges intersect either at interior points transversely or at common end points",
    "there is at least a vertex inside a  pseudo digon \" , that is , a region cobounded by two subarcs from two edges so that corners of the region are either two interior intersection points or one vertex and one interior intersection point .    if the number of intersections among edges is minimized , for example , by making all edges geodesics in the hyperbolic structure of the punctured plane , the condition ( 4 ) holds automatically .",
    "two immersed graphs are regarded as equivalent if one graph can be transformed to the other by an orientation - preserving homeomorphism of @xmath4 .",
    "thus we may assume that vertices lie on the customary locations if necessary .    throughout this article ,",
    "graphs mean immersed graphs in @xmath6 satisfying the condition discussed .",
    "if graphs are embedded in @xmath4 , we call them _",
    "planar_. the set of edges in a graph @xmath5 with @xmath0 vertices corresponds to a set of elements in @xmath1 as in figure  [ f : string ] .",
    "two equivalent graphs determine two sets of braids that differ by an inner automorphism of @xmath1 .",
    "if the set corresponding to edges generates @xmath1 , we say that @xmath5 _ generates _ @xmath1 and we are interested in graphs that generate @xmath1 . since an edge of @xmath5 corresponds to a transposition in the symmetric group , a graph that generates @xmath1 must be connected in order to permute any two vertices .",
    "but there are connected graphs that do not generate @xmath1 .",
    "the problem of deciding when an immersed graph generates the braid group is considered elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we now discuss how a braid word corresponds to an edge of a graph with @xmath0 vertices in the customary location .",
    "the artin generator @xmath7(or @xmath8 ) for @xmath9 corresponds to the clockwise(counterclockwise , respectively ) half twist along the straight edge joining the @xmath10-th and the @xmath11-st vertices .",
    "given an edge of a graph , we simplify the edge via a sequence of half twists @xmath7 or @xmath8 for @xmath9 until it becomes a straight edge corresponding to , say , @xmath12 .",
    "the required sequence can be expressed as a word @xmath13 in artin generators in which a half twist applied later is written on the left .",
    "then the edge that we started with corresponds to the braid word @xmath14 .",
    "the word @xmath13 is not uniquely expressed but @xmath13 as an element of @xmath1 is well - defined .",
    "the inverse of this correspondence is similar . given a conjugate @xmath14 , apply a sequence of half twists determined from right to left by @xmath15 to the straight edge @xmath12 .",
    "consequently each edge of a graph with @xmath0 vertices is uniquely represented by an element in @xmath1 that can be written as a conjugate of an artin generator .",
    "the following lemma summarizes this discussion .",
    "a braid @xmath16 in @xmath1 is the half twist along an arc joining two punctures in the plane if and only if @xmath16 can be written as a conjugate of an artin generator or its inverse .    from now on as long as no confusion arises",
    ", we will not distinguish three concepts , namely an edge of a graph , the half twist along the edge , and a conjugate word expressing the edge .",
    "since any two artin generators are conjugate each other , any half twist along an arc corresponds to a conjugate of a fixed artin generator .",
    "the following is immediate from the above lemma .",
    "[ conjugate ] a graph @xmath5 of @xmath0 vertices generates @xmath1 if and only if each artin generator can be expressed as @xmath17 for some edge @xmath18 and some word @xmath13 on edges of @xmath5 .    in the view of the above corollary , it is important to know how the conjugate of an edge by another edge in a graph looks like .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath16 be words in @xmath1 that express edges of a graph .",
    "if the edges @xmath18 and @xmath16 do not intersect each other and are not adjacent , they commute and so @xmath19 . if the edges @xmath18 and @xmath16 do not intersect each other and are adjacent , the three edges @xmath18 , @xmath16 , and @xmath20 form a triangle counterclockwise and the three edges @xmath18 , @xmath16 , and @xmath21 form a triangle clockwise as in figure  [ f : triangle ] .",
    "we note that there should be no other vertex inside the triangles and this can be achieved by drawing thin triangles inside a sufficiently small neighborhood of the union of two edges @xmath18 and @xmath16 .",
    "when the edges @xmath18 and @xmath16 intersect at an interior point , one can still describe the edges @xmath22 and @xmath23 but we do not need them in this article .    give a set @xmath24 of generators of the @xmath0-braid group @xmath1 , a _ positive word _",
    "in @xmath24 is a product of positive powers of generators in @xmath24 .",
    "a presentation of a group is _ finite _ if there are finitely many generators and relations .",
    "a presentation is _ positive _ if all defining relations are equations of positive words in generators .",
    "we now introduce the graphs that corresponds to some of known positive finite presentations of the braid groups .",
    "the set of artin generators @xmath25 of @xmath1 forms the graph in figure  [ f : artin ] and a minimal set of defining relations is given by @xmath26    the graphs in figure  [ f : artin ] will be called the _ artin _ graph .",
    "sergiescu @xcite showed how a finite presentation of @xmath1 can be obtained from any planar connected graph with @xmath0 vertices .",
    "he described a sufficient set of positive relations that depend only on the geometry of a given planar graph .",
    "we will give a minimal set of positive relations as a corollary of the main theorem in  3 .",
    "let @xmath0 be the number of vertices in @xmath5 . by choosing a fixed @xmath0 points in @xmath27 and a homeomorphism of @xmath27 that sends vertices of @xmath5 to the @xmath0 fixed points , the group @xmath28 introduced in @xcite",
    "is identified with the @xmath0-braid group @xmath1 .",
    "these presentations of @xmath1 will be called _",
    "sergiescu s presentations . _",
    "the relations in a sergiescu s presentation are highly redundant but they are useful when we need to find a relation locally given by a planar graph .",
    "recently a new presentation of @xmath1 called the band - generator presentation has been developed by birman - ko - lee@xcite .",
    "this presentation has @xmath29 generators @xmath30 for @xmath31 corresponds to the graph in figure  [ f : band ] and defining relations : @xmath32    the artin generator and the band - generators are related as @xmath33 and @xmath34 the set of band - generators are depicted as the graph in figure  [ f : band ] that will be called the _ inner complete _ graph .",
    "the relations @xmath35 will be called a _",
    "triangular _ relation . a triangular relation",
    "is derived whenever a new generator is introduced by means of a conjugation of an edge by an adjacent edge .",
    "triangular relations serve as building blocks of positive relations in the braid groups .",
    "after an immersed graph is turned into a planar graph by regarding all interior intersections as vertices , a region bounded by a closed edge - path is called a _ pseudo face _ if the edge - path contains at least one vertex that is an interior intersection of two edges as in figure  [ f : pseudo ] .",
    "a graph @xmath5 is said to be _ linearly spanned _ if it is connected and there is no vertex in any pseudo face of @xmath5 .",
    "a connected subgraph of a linearly spanned graph is clearly linearly spanned .",
    "two edges of a linearly spanned graph intersect each other at most once since any pseudo digon cobounded by two edges can not exist in a linearly spanned graph .",
    "all planar graphs and all subgraphs of the inner - complete graph are linearly spanned .",
    "for example the graph on the left in figure  [ f : linear ] is neither planar nor a subgraph of the inner - complete graph but it is linearly spanned , and the graph on the right is not linearly spanned    the following lemma justifies the terminology `` linearly spanned '' .    a linearly spanned graph that is a tree is equivalent to a subgraph of the inner - complete graph .",
    "choose a point @xmath3 far away from the graph . since the graph is a tree and no vertices",

    "if there is other vertices in the faces of this full subgraph and none of them is adjacent to the chosen 4 vertices , then there is an edge - path starting at a vertex @xmath87 on a face and ending at one of the 4 vertices such that the edge - path intersect the full subgraph of the 4 vertices and so @xmath87 is contained in a pseudo face . since @xmath5 is linearly spanned , this can not happen .",
    "thus at least one of vertices on faces , say @xmath88 , is adjacent to one of the 4 vertices",
    ". then we have the less number of unwanted vertices contained in faces of a new connected full subgraph that is obtained by replacing one of the 4 vertices by @xmath88 . by repeating this process",
    ", we eventually obtain a connect full subgraph @xmath73 with 4 vertices @xmath191 that can be separated by a circle from other vertices of @xmath5 .",
    "theorem  [ circle ] and theorem  [ 4vertex ] say that @xmath73 must be either the artin graph or the inner - complete graph with 4 vertices .",
    "choose a vertex @xmath192 in @xmath75 that is adjacent to one of @xmath191 .",
    "if @xmath73 is an inner - complete graph , then each full subgraph with the 4 vertices consisted of @xmath192 and any three vertices from @xmath191 must be an inner - complete graph by theorem  [ circle ] and theorem  [ 4vertex ] .",
    "thus the full subgraph with the 5 vertices @xmath193 is an inner - complete graph . by repeating this process , @xmath5 itself",
    "eventually becomes an inner - complete graph .",
    "we now suppose that @xmath73 is the artin graph with 4 vertices @xmath191 where @xmath194 are of valency 1 and the other vertices are of valency 2 .",
    "choose a vertex @xmath192 in @xmath75 that is adjacent to any one of @xmath191 .",
    "by theorem  [ circle ] and theorem  [ 4vertex ] , @xmath192 can be adjacent to either one or both of vertices @xmath194 .",
    "if @xmath192 is adjacent to both vertices , we stop the process .",
    "if @xmath192 is adjacent to one vertex , say @xmath195 , then @xmath196 form an artin graph and we repeat this process .",
    "eventually we see that @xmath5 must contain one of the following two types of graphs as a full subgraph separated by a circle as in theorem  [ circle ] unless @xmath5 itself is an artin graph .",
    "the proof will be completed when we show that both types of graphs do not have the embedding property .",
    "the graph of this type is depicted in figure  [ f : kcycle ] .",
    "let @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "then one can show that @xmath121 satisfy the hypothesis of lemma  [ length ] by a similar but longer argument as for figure  [ f : cycle ] .",
    "thus @xmath5 does not have the embedding property          we now show that @xmath203 suppose that @xmath204 then @xmath205 where @xmath206 . due to the triangular relation @xmath207 , the positive word @xmath208 must end with @xmath209 in order for @xmath210 to disappear .",
    "we will show that @xmath208 can not end with @xmath209 by an induction on @xmath211 .",
    "clearly @xmath212 can not end with @xmath164 in the band - generator presentation .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath214 ends with @xmath209 if and only if @xmath215 ends with @xmath209 if and only if @xmath216 ends with @xmath217 in the band - generator presentation . by the induction hypothesis",
    ", @xmath216 can not end with @xmath217 .",
    "similarly we have that @xmath218 consequently @xmath219 satisfy the hypothesis of lemma  [ length ] .",
