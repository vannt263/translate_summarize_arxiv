    "this prompts the following question :      this seems plausible in view of p. hanham s results in @xcite , which indicate that the proof of theorem  a relies critically on the particular structure of minsets that is forced by the presence of `` odd '' artin relators .",
    "this is very specific geometric information about specific elements of the group  information that can be lost after passing to a finite index subgroup .",
    "we remarked in section  [ sect3 ] after the proof of theorem  [ 3complexes ] and corollary  [ 3gens ] that our 3-dimensional constructions did not give cat(0 ) structures for 65 artin groups of type @xmath18 which are not finite type .",

    "as was pointed out in @xcite , one can also obtain arbitrarily large ( finite ) gaps by taking products of existing examples with themselves .",

    "for example , if one defines `` cat(0 ) dimension '' over the class of complete cat(0 ) spaces with the geodesic extension property and using kleiner s dimension for cat(0 ) spaces @xcite , then this dimension may be shown to be additive with respect to products of centreless groups .",
    "in contrast to the topological covering dimension , kleiner s dimension is additive with respect to products ; the remaining hypotheses allow one to use the splitting theorem ii.6.21 of @xcite .",
    "the groups of theorem [ manygens ] , part ( 2 ) , are contained in the class of extra - large type artin groups ( all @xmath604 ) which have already been shown to be biautomatic by d. peifer @xcite . according to corollary iii.@xmath605.4.8 of @xcite , any group which acts properly and cocompactly on a cat(0 ) space is semi - hyperbolic ( asynchronously bi - combable ) and hence has solvable word and conjugacy problems .",

    "there is , for example , the question mentioned in the introduction as to what happens if one removes the semi - simplicity assumption .",

    "the answer is yes if one restricts attention to actions on _ proper _",
