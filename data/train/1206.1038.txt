    "let @xmath4 be the segre embedding of the product of two projective spaces of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "the variety @xmath2 corresponds to the projectivization of the variety of rank one matrices embedded in the projectivization of the space of @xmath6 matrices .",
    "it is well known its dual variety ( the variety of tangent hyperplanes , see below for the definition ) , denoted by @xmath3 , can be identified with the variety of rank at most @xmath5 matrices . up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar ,",
    "the equation defining @xmath7 is the determinant .",
    "that point leads to a higher dimensional generalization of the determinant , called _ hyperdeterminant _ , which was first introduced by cayley ( 1840 ) and rediscovered by gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky ( 1992 ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors define the hyperdeterminant of format @xmath8 by the equation ( up to scale ) of the dual variety of @xmath9 .",
    "when the dual variety @xmath3 is not a hypersurface , the corresponding hyperdeterminant is defined to be zero .",
    "let @xmath10 be a projective variety and let @xmath11 denote the embedded tangent space of @xmath2 at a point @xmath12 ( smooth points of @xmath2 ) . define the _ dual variety _",
    "@xmath3 by    @xmath13    the biduality theorem @xmath14 ( true in characteristic zero ) implies that the original variety can be reconstructed from its dual variety .",
    "thus geometric invariants of @xmath3 reflect in geometric properties of @xmath2 .",
    "the dimension , degree and singularities of @xmath3 carry meaningful information about the hyperplane sections of @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these invariants have been studied for hyperdeterminants . in @xcite",
    "a condition is given to decide whether or not the hyperdeterminant of a given format is nonzero ( i.e. the dual of the segre embedding is actually a hypersurface ) , moreover in the same paper the authors give a combinatorial formula to compute the degree of a given hyperdeterminant .",
    "they also conjectured that there is only one hyperdeterminant whose corresponding hypersurface is regular in codimension one , i.e. @xmath15 , and this hyperdeterminant is of format @xmath16 . in other words",
    "@xmath17 is the only segre product of at least three projective spaces whose dual variety is a normal hypersurface .",
    "that conjecture was proved by weyman and zelevinsky in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the grassmannian of @xmath19-planes in @xmath20 , @xmath21 , embedded through the plcker map .",
    "its dual variety is a hypersurface except if @xmath22 and @xmath5 is odd @xcite .",
    "the degree of @xmath23 has been studied in @xcite . however",
    "the study of @xmath24 has not been carried out so far . in this article",
    "we answer the question of the normality of the duals of grassmannian varieties .",
    "the case of the grassmannian of @xmath25-planes is known and similar to the segre product of two projective spaces .",
    "the variety @xmath26 corresponds to the projectivization of the rank @xmath25 skew - symmetric matrices and its dual is identified with degenerate skew - symmetric matrices . like for the determinant , the singular locus of the degenerate skew - symmetric matrices is regular in codimension @xmath27 and arithmetically cohen macaulay ( @xcite )",
    "this proves that @xmath28 is normal .",
    "for @xmath29 the dual variety @xmath23 is a hypersuface .",
    "thus @xmath23 will be normal if and only if @xmath23 is regular in codimension one",
    ". this will be the main result of this article :    [ maintheo ] let @xmath30 , with @xmath29 .",
    "the dual variety @xmath23 is normal if and only if @xmath2 is one of the following : @xmath31    like for hyperdeterminants the general pattern is the following : the variety @xmath3 has a singular locus of codimension one and the only exceptions come from group actions with finite numbers of orbits .    the proof is based on the calculation of the dimension of @xmath32 , the dual of the secant variety of @xmath2 , which is always a component of @xmath33 .",
    "it turns out that this component appears in the decomposition of the singular locus of hyperdeterminants by @xcite . in their paper",
    "it corresponds to the general double point locus or node locus denoted by @xmath34 ( i.e. the set of hyperplane having more than one point of tangency on @xmath2 ) .",
    "an other component of interest is the cusp locus ( i.e. set of hyperplanes defining degenerate quadrics ) .",
    "the geometrical meaning of @xmath34 is not emphasized in @xcite when they calculate the dimension of this component . here in the contrary we mainly use geometric arguments to calculate the dimension of @xmath32 in the general case .",
    "let @xmath35 be the ( cone over the ) second osculating space , i.e. the linear span of second osculating spaces of smooth curves @xmath36 with @xmath37 . in @xmath38 we prove :    [ crit ] let @xmath10 be a smooth projective variety of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "assume @xmath3 is a hypersurface .",
    "suppose for a general pair of point @xmath39 we have @xmath40 , then @xmath41 .",
    "in particular @xmath3 is not normal .    in @xmath42",
    "we apply proposition [ crit ] to homogeneous rational varieties .",
    "in particular we obtain the following criteria on normality of duals of homogeneous varieties @xmath43 with @xmath44 a simple lie group @xmath44 and @xmath45 a parabolic subgroup .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the set of positive roots ( for some choice of the ordering of the roots of the lie algebra @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 the involution on the dual of the cartan subalgebra of @xmath47 :    let @xmath44 be a simple complex lie group and @xmath49 an irreducible representation . consider @xmath50 the projectivization of the highest weight orbit .",
    "if @xmath3 is normal then either @xmath51 is defective ( i.e. not of the expected dimension ) or there exists @xmath52 such that    @xmath53    the table of homogeneous varieties satisfying equation @xmath54 is given and the case of homogeneous varieties with defective secant is detailed .    in @xmath55 proposition [ crit ] and an explicit calculation of the second fundamental form of @xmath56",
    "allow us to prove theorem [ maintheo ] .",
    "we provide in that section geometric interpretations for the orbits in @xmath57 and explicitly describe the bijection between orbits in @xmath57 and orbits in the dual space .",
    "the orbits and their bruhat order are written down in a graphical way in the appendix of the paper .",
    "in @xmath58 we show how proposition [ crit ] can be applied to veronese embedding ( @xmath59 denotes the @xmath60-th veronese re - embedding of @xmath2 ) and segre products of nondegenerate smooth projective varieties :    [ veroseg ] let @xmath61 and @xmath62 two smooth nondegenerate projective varieties",

    "we work throughout with algebraic varieties over the field @xmath71 of complex numbers .",

    "given @xmath75 a smooth point of @xmath2 , we denote by @xmath76 the intrinsic tangent space , @xmath77 the embedded tangent space , and @xmath78 the second osculating space of @xmath2 at @xmath75 . the notation @xmath79 ( resp .",

    "the quadratic part of @xmath87 , denoted by @xmath90 , allows us to define a map ,    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the representatives for orbits with geometric interpretation can easly be identified .",
    "for instance it is clear that @xmath91 is a representative of the tangential variety .",
    "the varieties for which we need to explicitly write the new indexation of the basis to identify the representative are @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "the condition on the corner entry of each block appears from the same reason as condition @xmath145 in section @xmath55 .",
