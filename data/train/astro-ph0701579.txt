    "the line - of - sight velocity and velocity dispersion ( @xmath2 ) are important parameters in determining the flattening of the various disc layers , the intrinsic shape of the dark matter component , and the nature and extent of disc - halo interactions .",
    "if the gaseous layers in the disc are isothermal , the atomic and molecular gas should have similar scale - heights .",
    "however , due to the collective effects of gravitational instabilities , dissipation , and feedback from star - forming regions , the atomic gas has been observed to have a distribution different from that of its molecular counterparts .",
    "we have launched an extensive effort to analyse the processes that govern the ionized gas and compare them with those that control the neutral gaseous components in spiral galaxies ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "we have chosen ngc  628 for a pilot study in which we demonstrate the power of our state - of - the - art methods to study the properties of the ionized gas ( mainly h@xmath0ii regions but also diffuse ionized gas ) and their relation with the global kinematic parameters ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "a key feature of the velocity field of ngc  628 is its regularity .",
    "the global effects of any asymmetries , such as the oval distortion , are small , and in any case not very easy to detect in a face - on system .",
    "however , our detailed kinematic analysis has revealed the presence of a disc - like component in the inner kpc around the nucleus .",
    "the @xmath2 map shows widely distributed star - formation in the disc plane , and that the emission from unresolved h@xmath0ii regions probably dominates any emission from the diffuse component .",
    "the radial @xmath2-profile shows a nearly constant value of @xmath4 km / s ( more than twice that for the co and h@xmath0i ) out to 12 kiloparsec .",
