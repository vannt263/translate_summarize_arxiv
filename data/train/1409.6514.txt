    "a @xmath0-decay in a radionuclide represents an interesting and fascinating process where an excess energy is converted into matter and vice versa . for instance , in the process of @xmath0-electron emission , a neutron is converted into a proton by getting rid of the energy excess via the emission of an electron and an antineutrino . on the other hand , @xmath0-decay has been attracted the attention of different physical communities .",
    "for example , it has been considered as a powerful tool to study nuclear spectroscopy and obtained fundamental importance in nuclear and elementary particle physics and played an important key role for our understanding of fundamental interactions and their properties related to the symmetry and the conservation law ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "besides , a precise knowledge of the shapes of the @xmath0 spectra would substantially reduce the uncertainties in the measurements of the activity in ionizing radiation metrology .",
    "furthermore , these spectra are of strong interest in nuclear power plants and medical therapy . for example , in medical therapy an accurate spectrum of emitted electrons in a @xmath0 process is crucial in the determination of necessary doses which could be delivered to a given patient .    owing to the recent experimental advances as well as the increasing accuracy achieved in @xmath0-decay measurements ,",
    "more theoretical studies in @xmath0-decay processes have been strongly stimulated ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) . despite some theoretical activities during the last decades",
    "the field of the @xmath0-decay remains largely unexplored .",
    "these studies which have been carried out were mainly focused on allowed and first forbidden nonunique transitions . thus , it is particularly appropriate to address a systematic and a complete theoretical investigation extended to higher orders in the multipole expansion including the forbidden unique and nonunique transitions .",
    "a detailed nonperturbative treatment of the static coulomb field arising from the appropriate daughter nucleus charge have been presented by halpern @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the effects related to the static coulomb field of the daughter nucleus have been included in the wave functions of the emitted @xmath0-electron .",
    "in addition , the shape of the @xmath0 spectra , mainly at low energies , can be affected by the presence of the atomic electron cloud .",
    "thus , a nucleus experiencing a @xmath0-decay is generally surrounded by an atomic electron cloud and , in particular , a number of corrections due to the atomic electrons might influence the spectrum of emitted @xmath0-particle .",
    "these corrections arise through the inclusion of the screening in the wave function of the emitted @xmath0-particle or through exchange processes involving bound and continuum electrons @xcite if @xmath0-electron is involved .",
    "the corresponding effects are more important at relatively soft energy emissions .",
    "the first study of the exchange effect was limited to the @xmath1 orbital .",
    "it has been shown that the exchange term in the transition matrix element could interfere with the direct term and therefore can lead to a lower probability emission at low energy @xcite .",
    "the main aim of the present contribution is to address the above _ atomic _ effects , namely screening and exchange whatever the transition order .",
    "first we start with the definition of the @xmath0-decay form factors related to the nuclear and lepton vector currents .",
    "for such a consideration of nuclear @xmath0-decay , we will use the so - called _ phenomenological _ form of the weak interaction theory @xcite .",
    "hence , the effects related to the structure of the nucleons or meson exchange are ignored .",
    "we will mainly focus our attention on the leptonic current involving the @xmath0-electron and antineutrino wave functions . while , the nuclear current will be considered in the simplest approach , where the nucleons are described within the framework of dirac plane waves .",
    "although this approximation is crude , it enables one to address the relevant features and a qualitative understanding of the implications of the multipole expansion in the transition matrix element @xcite .",
    "effects due to the static coulomb field of the nucleus as well as the screening corrections associated to the atom electron cloud are included in the nonperturbative treatment .",
    "therefore the _ post _ electromagnetic interaction between the @xmath0-electron and the daughter nucleus is taken into account to all orders .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secform ] , we present the theory for @xmath0-decay based on the simple weak phenomenological interaction and establish the conventions and definitions used in this work . the description of the @xmath0-electron wave function in a screened potential due to the atomic electron cloud is discussed .",
    "the antisymmetrization in the final - state wave function under the exchange of the @xmath0-electron and the atomic electron coordinates , resulting in an exchange contribution in the transition amplitude is addressed in this section . in sec .",
    "[ secres ] , we compare the results of our calculations with some experimental data and discuss some aspects of the energy spectra of emitted @xmath0-electron .",
    "atomic units are used throughout except where otherwise stated .",
    "in @xmath0-decay , a radionuclide undergoes a change in nuclear charge by one unit .",
    "this _ sudden _ change in the nuclear charge could lead to a modification in the atomic electron cloud , as a result an atomic electron may undergo an excitation or ionization transitions , due to the imperfect overlap in the atomic parent and atomic daughter wave functions . these modifications are negligible ( @xmath2 ) @xcite and hence can be ignored in this work .",
    "however , in the present work we consider some atomic electron effects , namely :    @xmath3 the screening effect , where the atomic electron cloud can partially screen the coulomb field of the daughter nucleus ,    @xmath4 the exchange effect which is a consequence of the antisymmetrization in the final - state wave function under the exchange of the @xmath0-electron and the atomic electron coordinates .",
    "this exchange leads to the creation of a @xmath0-electron into a bound orbital of the daughter atom resulting in a simultaneous emission of a bound atomic electron into a continuum state of the same daughter atom .      to describe a @xmath0-decay process of a radionuclide which is subject to weak interaction",
    ", one can start with the consideration of the s - matrix given in the point - like nature of the decay , according to fermi s theory , by ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) ,    @xmath5    in this expression , and similarly everywhere after , the summation over repeated greek letters is assumed .",
    "the covariant @xmath6 and contravariant @xmath7 four - vectors are connected by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the metric tensor of the four - dimensional flat - space and defined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 stands for the vector coupling constant in the weak interaction , with @xmath14 the universal weak coupling constant and @xmath15 the cabbibo angle .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the speed of light .",
    "further , the four - vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are the lepton and nuclear form factors , respectively , and are given in the context of a pure v - a weak interaction by : @xmath20 \\label{1a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath21 \\label{1b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the ratio @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the axial vector and vector coupling constants in the weak interaction . in the case of point - like nucleons , _",
    "i.e. _ without any internal structure , @xmath26 , but , throughout this work we have used @xmath22 .",
    "the quantities @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for the creation and destruction field operators of the corresponding particle .",
    "the @xmath31 with ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 @xcite are the standard dirac matrices ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the transition s - matrix element taken between the initial @xmath34 and final @xmath35 nuclear states of the nucleon reads @xmath36 . in the case of @xmath0-electron emission the initial and final states ( in the fock - space ) during the process are given , respectively , by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the wave functions in real space are obtained by acting the creation and destruction operator on the fock - states as follow : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 describes the wave function , in real space , of the emitted @xmath0-electron with energy @xmath44 moving in the static coulomb field of the daughter nucleus and in presence of the atomic electron cloud . while @xmath45 stands for the antineutrino wave function with a positive energy @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , the proton and neutron are described by @xmath47 and @xmath48 with energies @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . inserting these expressions in equation ( [ 1 ] ) and after performing the integration over time component @xmath51 of @xmath52 one can easily obtain    @xmath53    in the above equation the @xmath54 function ensures the energy conservation .",
    "the four - vector form factors @xmath55 and @xmath56 are given by : @xmath57 and @xmath58 before evaluating these integrals it is worth to stress the following points :    @xmath3 due to the large mass of the nucleus , the typical recoil velocities of the nucleus after the decay in the laboratory reference frame are not only nonrelativistic but much below the @xmath0-electron velocity .",
    "taking this into account , the laboratory frame and the center of the nucleus can be assumed as identical .",
    "@xmath4 for simplicity , the finite size of the nucleus is ignored and is assumed as point - like with charge @xmath59 .      the motion of the nucleons , during the decay ,",
    "is assumed to be a free motion and thus is described by free dirac four - spinors .",
    "a better description of the motion of the nucleons inside the nucleus is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be given in a future paper .",
    "all other effects related to the structure of the nucleons and meson exchange are also ignored here . accordingly with their motion , the nucleons are assumed to be on their mass shell such that the proton and neutron wave functions are given by free dirac plane waves :    @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 stand for the normalization volumes for the dirac plane waves describing the proton and neutron , respectively . @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the proton and neutron masses .",
    "@xmath66 is the dirac free four - spinor of a given particle ( `` @xmath67 '' for a proton and `` @xmath68 '' for a neutron ) with momentum @xmath69 and spin projection @xmath70 .",
    "inserting these expressions in the form factor @xmath71 one obtains easily @xmath72 with , @xmath73 inserting these results in the expression ( [ s - matrix - element ] ) of the s - matrix element , accordingly the latter reads    @xmath74      once the s - matrix element is obtained ( [ s - matrix - element2 ] ) , the transition probability per unit of time ( @xmath75 ) can be derived following the standard way . imposing @xmath76",
    "the transition probability reads :    @xmath77    in the above expression we have used the relation @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "the differential decay rate as a function of emitted @xmath0 electron is given by the relation : @xmath80      in order to calculate the lepton form factor it is necessary to introduce the appropriate wave functions describing each lepton , namely neutrinos / antineutrinos and electrons / positrons .",
    "the neutrino ( antineutrino ) has no charge and interacts practically only through the weak interaction which is considered here as a perturbation causing the decay .",
    "therefore , the unperturbed wave function ( free of the weak interaction ) describing the antineutrino is simply a dirac plane wave and is readily given by : @xmath81 @xmath82 stands for the normalization volume of the antineutrino wave function . @xmath83 and @xmath84 are its momentum and spin projection , respectively , and @xmath85 is its rest mass .",
    "@xmath86 is the negative energy component of a neutrino with a momentum @xmath87 and negative energy @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath0-electron has an electric charge , thus its wave function may be distorted by the electromagnetic interaction with the nuclear charge and the atomic electron cloud .",
    "therefore , the distorted wave function describing the @xmath0-electron with an angular momentum parameter @xmath89 and a given energy @xmath44 can be written in the form @xcite :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the total kinetic momentum @xmath94 and the orbital momentum @xmath95 . @xmath96",
    "refer to the clebsch - gordan coefficients @xcite .",
    "further , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the large and small radial components of the electronic wave functions . for a given energy @xmath99 ,",

    "the potential @xmath104 is an electrostatic central atomic potential due to the _ point - like _ charge of the daughter nucleus embedded in the atomic electron cloud .",
    "this potential is described later in the next subsection .",
    "+ the solutions of the dirac radial equations ( [ dirac - eq ] ) can be obtained by using standard numerical methods .",
    "here we have followed the numerical method described in detail in @xcite which is close to the method given in @xcite .",
    "once the dirac radial wave functions ( [ electron - wf ] ) are obtained , the evaluation of the integral @xmath105 ( [ l - vect ] ) can be achieved .",
    "hence it is very appropriate to proceed first in expanding , in equation ( [ l - vect ] ) , the plane waves in partial waves using the following relation : @xmath106 @xmath107 corresponds to the angular momentum carried by the radiation field and transmitted between the decaying nucleus and the arising leptons from the reaction .",
    "each term in the above expansion refers to as a multipole of order @xmath107 , and the lowest orders in this expansion are the most important ones due to the smallness of the product @xmath108 .",
    "the transitions arising from the first term in the expansion @xmath109 are referred to as _ allowed _ transitions and those associated to higher orders @xmath110 are called _ forbidden _ ones .",
    "more precisely , the allowed transitions occur between two nuclear states with spin difference @xmath111 and having the same parity , i.e. @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the initial ( final ) spin and parity of the nucleus , respectively .",
    "however , forbidden transitions of order @xmath107 are occurring between states with @xmath115 and spin difference @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "the transitions with @xmath116 are called nonunique and those with @xmath118 are specified as being unique ones .",
    "furthermore , since the nuclear states before and after the decay have well defined spins , the angular momentum transmitted to the lepton current is restricted to values which can be combined to the nuclear spins in such a way that angular momentum is conserved .",
    "accordingly , we obtain for leptonic vector form factor @xmath119 with , @xmath120 and @xmath121 taking into account the expression ( [ electron - wf ] ) of the above wave function of the emitted electron , @xmath122 becomes    @xmath123    and can be reduced to @xmath124 the integrals over the solid angle @xmath125 are performed analytically using the orthogonal properties of the spherical harmonics .",
    "the typical integral involved in this calculation has the form : @xmath126 and explicitly reads : @xmath127 where @xmath128 represents the @xmath129 symbol with @xmath130 ( @xmath131 or @xmath132 ) .",
    "this symbol is zero except for @xmath133 , @xmath134 is integer and fulfills the triangle relation @xmath135 .",
    "these conditions altogether represent all selection rules and the law of the angular and kinetic momentum conservations .",
    "further , in equation ( [ fg - integrals ] ) @xmath14 et @xmath136 are real functions and are given by :    @xmath137    @xmath0 spectra are usually calculated by using the electron radial wave functions evaluated at the nuclear radius @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "this approach is not appropriate regarding the influence of the atomic effects namely the screening .",
    "for instance , the screening on the @xmath0 electron wave functions is very weak at this distance ( @xmath139 , see equation ( [ screening - pot ] ) in the next subsection below ) and the corresponding modifications are completely negligible over the entire range of the spectrum .",
    "hence , to take the screening into account , it is necessary to consider the spatial extension of the wave functions beyond the size of the nucleus by using a screened potential .",
    "+ consequently , the integrals ( [ l - integral ] ) are performed numerically from @xmath140 to @xmath141 .",
    "this limitation is due to the fact that in this study , the nucleons are described as free particles ( since we are not interested in absolute decay rate ) instead of bound nucleons and thus , the nucleon wave functions must vanish outside the nucleus .",
    "+      when calculating a @xmath0 spectrum , the screening effect is generally taken into account by using a constant thomas - fermi potential which is subtracted from the total energy of the particle @xcite .",
    "this method creates a non - physical discontinuity at the minimum energy defined by the potential @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this simple method , which makes possible the use of analytical wave functions , is not reasonable for high @xmath59 and at low energy .",
    "the usual way is to correct the coulomb potential by the average influence of the atomic electrons .",
    "thus , the screened potential , according to the superposition law , is given by : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the screening function which contains the average effect of the atomic electrons and the remaining @xmath59 protons of the nucleus .",
    "almost all approximate analytical expressions are derived from the thomas - fermi statistical model of the atom and only a few exceptions are based on self - consistent hartree - fock or hartree - fock - slater ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we have used the more recent screened potentials given by salvat equation ( 11 ) in @xcite for ( @xmath144 ) , i.e. @xmath145 where the various parameters @xmath146 and @xmath147 used for the analytical screening function @xmath143 are given by salvat such that @xmath148 ) ( see table i in @xcite ) . for larger @xmath59",
    "we used the molire expression given by equation ( 8) in the same reference @xcite .",
    "moreover , when we calculate the bound state orbitals ( for larger @xmath149 _ e.g. _ @xmath150pu ) involved in the exchange corrections ( see below ) we have used the expression given by green _ _ e__t al .",
    "@xcite ( see also expressions ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "note that in the above expression ( [ pot ] ) we use @xmath151 as the charge of the daughter nucleus , in such a way that the asymptotic net charge , @xmath152 , holds .",
    "consistently , a coulomb potential generated by a daughter nuclear charge screened by the atomic electrons was defined .",
    "the calculation of the exchange effect for @xmath150pu has already been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the formalism given in @xcite , where the exchange effect is expressed just as a correction factor which modifies the beta emission probability at low energy . furthermore , in @xcite the authors have only considered the exchange involving @xmath70 and @xmath153 electrons , i.e. with @xmath154 , and used for the @xmath0 electron wave function the dirac wave function evaluated at the nuclear radius @xmath138 ( see equation ( 2 ) of @xcite ) . in this section",
    ", we will consider the exchange effect , which is purely a quantum effect , in a more transparent and consistent way .    in @xmath0-electron decay measurements of a many - electron atom , it is impossible to distinguish whether the detected electron is emitted from the nucleus ( the direct @xmath0-electron ) or emitted from a bound state of the parent atom , while the @xmath0-electron being created in an empty bound orbital of the daughter atom .",
    "the latter case is a consequence of the the linear combination of the _ normal product _ of the two field operators associated to two electrons being created in bound and continuum final states simultaneously .",
    "the anti - commutation ( fermions ) relation of these fields leads to an antisymmetrization of the bound - continuum wave functions and , therefore , to additional `` indirect '' terms in the transition matrix element .    in the following analysis we consider a decaying parent neutral atom with @xmath59 electrons",
    "whose the total wave function describing @xmath59 electrons is denoted by @xmath155 .",
    "after decay , the @xmath151 electrons , including the @xmath0-electron , are described by @xmath156 .",
    "accordingly , the effects related to a decay of a many - electron atom can be included by rewriting expression ( [ l - vect ] ) in a new form : @xmath157    the expression ( [ l - exchange1 ] ) can be rewritten in a simpler form    @xmath158    in the above expression , the notation @xmath159 under the sum denotes all possible bound states of the daughter atom . the first term on the rhs of the equation ( [ l - exchange2 ] )",
    "is called the direct term , it involves the direct creation of @xmath0 electron in the continuum @xmath43 , while the the atomic electrons are treated as spectators during the decay process .",
    "however , the last terms are the exchange terms and related to the probability amplitude of creating an electron in a given bound subshell of the daughter atom and simultaneously accompanied by an emission of an atomic electron from an initial bound state to the continuum .",
    "the index @xmath160 is used to define the quantum numbers of electrons being created bound or positive energy continuum orbitals of the daughter atom . in terms of single electron wave functions , the reduced matrix element @xmath161 in expression ( [ l - exchange2 ] )",
    "can be written in the form @xmath162 here @xmath163 stands for the wave function of @xmath0 electron being created in a given bound subshell ( @xmath164 ) of the daughter atom .",
    "furthermore , the quantities @xmath165 and @xmath166 are accordingly expressed as @xmath167 and @xmath168    @xmath169 is a normalization constant factor for a particular atom and independent of @xmath0 electron energy . @xmath170 and @xmath171 stand for the slater determinants of the single electronic wave functions describing an electron in the the orbital @xmath172 of the parent and daughter atom , respectively .",
    "the coefficient @xmath165 involves only the overlap between the electron radial wave functions of the bounds orbitals of the parent and daughter atoms .",
    "however , the exchange term , related to the coefficients @xmath173 involves the overlap between the electron radial wave functions of the bound and continuum orbitals having the same quantum numbers .",
    "in addition the main contribution in the above overlaps comes from the the leading diagonal product of the determinant @xcite .",
    "therefore , the overlaps @xmath165 and @xmath174 are related , to a good approximation , in the following expression @xmath175 note that in the above expression , the continuum @xmath43 has the same quantum numbers as the orbital @xmath176 of the parent atom from which the electron was emitted . inserting this expression in @xmath177 equation ( [ l - exchange2 ] ) ,",
    "one gets    @xmath178 .",
    "\\label{l - exchange3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this equation is similar to the term in the squared bracket ( equation ( 2 ) of @xcite ) except in this paper we have replaced @xmath179 and @xmath180 wave functions evaluated at the size of the nucleus @xcite with respectively @xmath181 and @xmath182 containing the integration over the entire space - position of the @xmath0 electron .",

    "+ @xmath184 are the single electron bound wave functions , solutions of the dirac equation which describes a bound electron in the field of the parent nucleus with a charge @xmath59 and the field of the remaining ( @xmath185 ) bound electrons .",
    "in contrast to the potential ( [ pot ] ) used to obtain the continuum wave functions ( @xmath186 ) , the potential here accounts for the electrostatic self - interaction which must be subtracted from ( [ pot ] ) ( see @xcite for more details ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the analytical potentials given by salvat ( see equations ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) of @xcite ) for ( @xmath144 ) . and ,",
    "for larger @xmath59 we use the expressions ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) from the same reference @xcite and the two parameters in the cited expressions are obtained from @xcite .    here",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath187 stand for a single electron continuum and bound dirac wave functions in the field of the daughter atom , respectively .",
    "as stated above , in order to obtain the bound wave function @xmath187 describing a single electron in an atomic orbital , one has to account for self - interaction and to remove it from the screened potential of the daughter nucleus with a charge @xmath188 .",
    "in this section we will briefly consider the beta spectra of @xmath150pu @xcite , @xmath189ni @xcite and @xmath190la @xcite .",
    "this consideration is based on the results derived in the previous sections where the atomic exchange and the coulomb effects due to the nuclear point - like charge screened by the atomic electrons were included .",
    "the numerical calculations are then compared to recent experimental data .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra of @xmath150pu and @xmath189ni were recently measured using metallic magnetic calorimeters .",

    "the transition is allowed ( @xmath191 ) , while for @xmath150pu the transition is first forbidden non unique ( @xmath192 ) . in the case of @xmath150pu , although the transition is first forbidden non unique , it can be calculated as allowed in the framework of the @xmath193 approximation @xcite . moreover ,",
    "complete calculation of the nuclear matrix elements in the framework of the nilsson model was already performed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown , that the corresponding correction increases linearly with the energy , not higher than 0.3@xmath194 at the endpoint and 0.1@xmath194 below 8 kev .",
    "thus , this transition can be calculated with confidence as allowed . the @xmath190la decay exhibits a second forbidden unique transition ( @xmath195 ) and",
    "has been measured in a very recent experiment using a labr@xmath196:ce scintillator @xcite , where enhanced counting statistics and a low energy cut off of 2.5  kev were achieved .",
    "all these measured spectra , with high accuracy , might be an excellent challenge for the theoretical calculations . in the present work ,",
    "these experiments are compared with our calculations with and without screening and exchange corrections .",
    "-electron in @xmath189ni decay .",

    "solid line presents calculation including the screening and the exchange corrections .",
    "dashed line represents the screening contribution only .",
    "dot - dashed line is the result of using only the simple coulomb correction potential wave functions without screening .",

    "the intensity of the spectrum is given in arbitrary units ( ar . u. ) , and therefore , the theoretical calculations are normalized to the experimental data at high energies . ]    in fig.[fig1 ] we illustrate a comparison between calculated spectra and the experimental data of @xmath189ni .",
    "the theoretical calculations are normalized to the experimental data at high energies .",
    "this normalization is due to the fact that we have used the dirac plane waves to describe the nucleons inside the nucleus .",
    "the figure shows that the screening in comparison with pure coulomb description for @xmath189ni has a very tiny effect , as expected for this low @xmath59 nucleus .",
    "however the exchange corrections have a valuable influence on the energy spectra at low emission energy .",
    "one can see a very good agreement when both , screening and exchange , corrections are taken into account .",
    "the low contribution of the screening correction is due to the fact that the size of the nucleus is much smaller than the size of the inner atomic orbital ( @xmath197 ) , thus much smaller than the size of the atom itself .",
    "therefore , when spatial integration involved in the lepton current is performed within a region much smaller than the size of the atom , the screened potential is practically reduced to the pure coulomb field : @xmath198 . on the other hand , when calculating the exchange contribution to the spectrum , the atomic orbitals are calculated in a screened potential , which must distort the wave functions and can contribute significantly to the overlap between the orbitals of the parent and daughter atoms .",

    "we illustrate the comparisons between calculated spectra and the experimental data as in fig.[fig1 ] but for @xmath150pu .",
    "theoretical calculations are normalized to the experimental data as in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the figure shows that the effects due to the screening in the wave function compared to the coulomb description are less pronounced , as in the case of @xmath189ni , in contrast to the explanation given above .",
    "however , the exchange correction has a substantial influence on the energy spectrum and the agreement with the experimental data is more reproduced in the low energy region . although , the screening , on one s own , seems to have a tiny effect on the spectra , its combination with the exchange correction contributes very significantly to the @xmath0 spectra through the distortion of the atomic orbitals in the screened potential , and thus , modifies significantly the overlap between the atomic orbitals before and after the decay .",
    "furthermore , calculated spectra shown in fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] were obtained by performing the radial integration over a region from 0 to @xmath202 and the results therefore obtained are @xmath202 independent , provided that @xmath203 .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] illustrates our theoretical calculations for the second forbidden unique transition of @xmath190la ( @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 ) compared to recent experimental data @xcite . as for both allowed and first non unique forbidden transitions",
    ", the figure shows that the effects due to the screening in the @xmath199electron wave function are negligible .",
    "furthermore , the exchange and screening effects together have a very significant influence on the energy spectrum .",
    "nevertheless some discrepancy remains at low energies ( below 5 kev ) where theoretical calculations with screening and exchange predict a strong decrease in the spectrum in contrast to measured data .",
    "in addition , we met a serious complication in the calculation of the spectrum of @xmath190la due to the sensitivity of the results on the size of the region of integration .",
    "the above results displayed in fig.[fig3 ] were obtained for @xmath207 .",
    "but for @xmath190la .",
    "the experimental data are from @xcite .",
    "the theoretical calculations are normalized to the experimental data at high energies . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have considered the energy spectra of emitted electron in @xmath0-decay .",
    "we have focused our attention on the exact determination of the leptonic vector current .",
    "the corrections due to the screened coulomb field by the atomic electron cloud were included .",
    "it is shown that , as a result of these corrections , the low energy region of the @xmath0 spectrum is slightly modified .",
    "the indirect term , or so - called exchange contribution , has been included consistently to the transition matrix elements of the @xmath0-decay .",
    "the latter correction can be thought of as a consequence of the antisymmetrization of the bound atomic electrons and the continuum @xmath0-electron wave functions .",
    "+ in such a case , we have shown that the exchange effects have a strong influence on the energy spectra at low energy region .",
    "comparisons between calculated spectra and recent experimental data of @xmath189ni , @xmath150pu and @xmath190la decays show very good agreements when both screening and exchange corrections are included .",
    "the agreement is excellent down to very low emission energies for both @xmath189ni and @xmath150pu , independently on the region of integration , provided that @xmath208 .",
    "+ a small discrepancy remains in the spectrum of the second forbidden unique transition of @xmath190la .",
    "it can be due to the quality of the measurement from @xcite .",
    "_ are currently carrying out new measurements of the @xmath190la decay , and there are some clues for a rise of the @xmath0 spectrum below 10  kev .",
    "this discrepancy can also be thought of as occurring due to the crude description of the nuclear current .",
    "indeed , in this paper we have assumed that the active nucleons , during the decay process , move freely in the nucleus .",
    "thus a different and more elaborate description of the nuclear current is required and will be considered in a future paper .",
