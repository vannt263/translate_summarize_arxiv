    "quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory . it does not assign definite outcomes to certain measurements",
    ". a physicist performing identical measurements on two identically prepared systems might get different measurement outcomes .",
    "quantum mechanics postulates that the outcomes of some measurements are undetermined before the measurement .",
    "this randomness in the measurement outcomes has been used to generate random numbers .    it might be argued that the randomness in the measurement outcome is not really undetermined before the measurement .",
    "it is perhaps determined by some hidden variables that provide a more complete description of the system , but they are unknown to the physicist .",
    "however , this hidden - variable description of nature was recently tested in three bell test experiments and was found to be incompatible with the observed experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the observed data were consistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "in other words , we see in our experiments that nature behaves randomly , as postulated by quantum mechanics .",
    "this implies that if the experimental observations obey some relations and on the condition that the experiment was performed correctly , we can certify the measurement outcomes were undetermined before the measurement was performed .",
    "that is , their outcomes generated new random numbers .",
    "the conditions that need to be satisfied are those for a loophole - free bell experiment .",
    "remarkably , these conditions do not include that the physicist know the mechanisms of the measuring device .",
    "this observation makes the realization of a device - independent ( di ) quantum random - number generator ( qrng ) possible . in a diqrng , the user is able to certify the creation of new random numbers despite being ignorant of the device mechanisms .    in certifying the generation of new random numbers , the user trusts that quantum mechanics provides a complete description of nature .",
    "based on the statistics of the measurement outcomes , he can put a bound on the correlations between his measurement outcomes and any other system that exists outside of his lab .",
    "this bound allows him to extract new random numbers from the measurement outcomes , that is , random numbers which are not correlated to any system outside of his lab .",
    "the first proof - of - concept diqrng used entangled photons generated in an atomic ion trap to certify 42 new random numbers over a period of about one month  @xcite .",
    "more recently , using a more efficient entanglement source , @xmath0 bits of new randomness were created at a rate of @xmath1 bits / s  @xcite .",
    "both setups used the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) value  @xcite to certify the randomness .",
    "the chsh value is a function of the measurement statistics , and this value sets a lower bound on the di randomness that can be certified .",
    "it turns out that using different bell operators , that is , different functions of the measurement statistics , will give different equally valid lower bounds to the di randomness from the same measurement statistics . in  @xcite ,",
    "several previously known as well as randomly generated bell operators were tested and shown to certify varying amount of randomness from the two - qubit werner state .",
    "these operators were chosen in an _ ad hoc _ manner , and no single operator was found to be optimal for all the werner states .    in  @xcite",
    ", the complete measurement statistics were used to obtain a bound on the di randomness instead of resorting to a specific bell operator .",
    "this gives the highest lower bound on the di randomness .",
    "a by - product of this process is the optimal bell operator that would have given the same bound .",
    "this bell operator gives the maximum di randomness for the given measurement statistics .    in a bell setup for generating new random numbers",
    ", the physicist has a choice of the measurement operators to use . by optimizing these operators",
    ", he can get a better bound on the di randomness .",
    "this is the question that we address : how much randomness can the physicist certify by using the optimal measurement operator ? recently , this question was also addressed in  @xcite for an experimentally relevant optical bell experiment setup and in  @xcite , where the requirement for full device independence was relaxed .",
    "we consider the usual bell setup for generating di random numbers .",
    "the user inputs two random and independent measurement settings , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and receives two measurement outcomes , @xmath4 . in a di setup",
    ", the user does not have any knowledge of the measurement device .",
    "the behavior of the apparatus is solely characterized by the conditional probabilities @xmath5 , which we view as the components of the vector @xmath6 .",
    "the user will use one measurement setting , @xmath7 , to generate his random numbers ; the other settings are only used to obtain bounds on the di randomness .",
    "following  @xcite , the maximum guessing probability for an adversary , eve , who is constrained by quantum mechanics and has perfect knowledge of the measurement apparatus is @xmath8 = \\max_{\\{q_{ab},\\mathbf{p}_{ab}\\ } } \\sum_{ab } q_{ab }   p_{ab}(a , b|x^\\ast , y^\\ast)\\label{pri}\\\\ & \\textrm{such that \\ ; }   \\sum_{ab } q_{ab }    \\mathbf{p}_{ab}=\\mathbf{p}\\;\\label{con}\\\\ & \\textrm{and \\ ; } \\mathbf{p}_{ab } \\in \\mathcal{q}\\;.\\label{conq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the notation @xmath9 means that the conditional probabilities @xmath6 can be realized in quantum mechanics . in other words ,",
    "there exist a state @xmath10 and some measurement operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "the constraint  ( [ con ] ) ensures that the weighted sum of the particular behaviors @xmath14 gives the observed behavior @xmath6 .",
    "eve can realize the guessing probability @xmath15 $ ] if the measurement device behaves according to @xmath14 with probability @xmath16 and eve knows the particular behavior of each measurement .",
    "for each instant of a particular behavior @xmath14 , eve s guess of the measurement outcome will be @xmath17 .",
    "if the maximum guessing probability is less than 1 , then the lower bound to the amount of certifiable di randomness is quantified by the minimum entropy @xmath18 .",
    "the optimization problem  ( [ pri ] ) is a conic linear program , and its dual can be formulated as @xmath19 = \\min_{\\mathbf{f } } \\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\mathbf{p } \\label{dual}\\\\ & \\textrm{such that \\ ; } p'(a , b|x^\\ast , y^\\ast ) \\leq   \\mathbf{f}\\cdot    \\mathbf{p ' } \\;\\textrm { for } a , b \\in   \\left\\{-1,1 \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\textrm{and all \\ ; } \\mathbf{p ' } \\in \\mathcal{q}\\;.\\label{dualcon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solution of the dual program coincides with the solution of the primal program : @xmath20=g[\\mathbf{p}]$ ] .",
    "the optimization variable @xmath21 corresponds to a bell expression that gives rise to a guessing probability of @xmath22 .",
    "the optimal @xmath21 that achieves the minimum then corresponds to the optimal bell expression that minimizes eve s guessing probability given the behavior @xmath6 .    in general",
    ", the optimization problems ( [ pri ] ) and ( [ dual ] ) can be computationally hard to solve .",
    "however the constraints ( [ con ] ) and ( [ dualcon ] ) can be relaxed @xcite to give upper bounds to the guessing probabilities in a way that the programs can be cast as a semidefinite program ( sdp ) which can be solved efficiently .",
    "these relaxations can be progressively tightened to give bounds that are successively tighter .",
    "while the user of a dirng has no access to the workings of the device , the physicist who builds the device has a choice of the quantum state @xmath10 and the measurement operators @xmath23 that he wants to implement in the operation of the device .",
    "the vector @xmath23 has components @xmath24 which are rank - one projectors and satisfy @xmath25 for example , if his machine can prepare the pure entangled two - qubit state @xmath26 , then as shown in  @xcite , by designing the measurement operators to be projectors along @xmath27 with the angles @xmath28 the device will be able to certify two bits of randomness with the measurement settings @xmath29 .",
    "however , if the measurement operators used were not optimal , the machine will exhibit a different behavior and may certify less randomness .",
    "so if the builder can prepare a maximally entangled two - qubit state and use the optimal measurement operator , then the device will be able to certify two bits of randomness , and all is good .",
    "however , if the builder is technologically limited to preparing some other state @xmath10 , then in general the measurement operators in  ( [ m2 ] ) will not be optimal anymore . in this case",
    ", the builder is then interested in finding the measurement operator he should implement that would certify the maximum randomness given @xmath30 are more unpredictable than others , then more randomness can potentially be extracted by post - selecting a subset of the symbols @xmath17 . although the post - selection reduce the number of data - points available for randomness extraction , the post - selected data might be more random , which makes it harder to for eve to guess correctly .",
    "the net result can be an increase in the final randomness generation rate  @xcite . ] given that he is restricted to the state @xmath10 .",
    "this is the task that we shall now investigate .",
    "more precisely , we want to find @xmath31=\\max_{\\boldsymbol{\\pi } } d\\left[p(\\boldsymbol{\\pi } ) \\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and the vector @xmath23 is constrained by  ( [ picon ] ) .",
    "admittedly , we have not solved this problem .",
    "instead , we present and implement an iterative algorithm in algorithm  [ algo1 ] that converges to a local maximum of @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "input states @xmath10 , initial positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xmath34 , and stopping criteria @xmath35 initialize guessing probability @xmath36 and povm @xmath37 update @xmath38 and @xmath39 compute @xmath40 compute @xmath20 $ ] and corresponding @xmath21 by solving the relaxed version of  ( [ dual ] ) compute the minimum of @xmath41 and corresponding @xmath42[step5 ] @xmath42    [ algo1 ]    the tolerance @xmath35 sets the stopping condition for the algorithm . in step  [ step5 ] ,",
    "we compute the minimum of guessing probability @xmath43 which corresponds to finding the measurement settings that maximizes the bell value for a given bell expression @xmath21 .",
    "the guessing probability @xmath44 is a quadratic function of @xmath11 and @xmath12 with the quadratic constraints  ( [ picon ] ) .",
    "we can use the lagrange multiplier method to find the minimum .",
    "while the algorithm might not find the global maximum @xmath45 $ ] , it usually finds measurement settings that yield more di randomness than a randomly chosen measurement setting . in our implementation",
    ", we use several initial settings @xmath34 in an attempt to find the global maximum .",

    "two bits of di randomness are also achievable when @xmath53 is arbitrarily close to zero with @xmath54 measurement settings  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : chsh ] , we plot the di randomness as a function of nonlocality as measured by the chsh value @xmath60 .",

    "for two ( solid line ) and four ( dashed line ) measurement settings on each side .",
    "the four - measurement - setting randomness bound that we report here is slightly higher than the results reported in  @xcite , where there are two fixed settings for one side and four fixed settings for the other side .",
    "we computed the fixed settings using both the second- and third - order relaxations of the sdp hierarchy , but they might turn out to be identical when a tighter constraint is used . we find no improvement in the tomographic result ( dash - dotted line ) compared to the results using a fixed measurement setting reported in  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : vis ] , we fix the input state to have @xmath51 and plot the di randomness as a function of visibility for @xmath52 and @xmath54 .",

    "randomness increases monotonically with @xmath63 as one would expect .",
    "this is because from a high - visibility state , one can always introduce noise to get to a state with lower visibility and attain at least the same di randomness .    .",
    "for a fixed visibility , the randomness rate is not a monotonic function of @xmath53 .",

    "the dip in the randomness rates when @xmath68 is unlikely due to the algorithm being stuck in a local maximum .",
    "we check this numerically by scanning the whole parameter space . for the case of a qubit pair input that we are considering ,",
    "the measurement directions that the user uses to generate his tomographic randomness can be parametrized by the bloch vector angles @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
