    "for instance , planetary nebulae , cataclysmic variables , neutron stars and supernovae sometimes show bipolar jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in active galactic nuclei",
    ", we can see accretion powered jets emanating from the central engine @xcite . in star forming regions , jets are ubiquitous and can be found associated with young stellar objects ranging from brown dwarfs to high mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "star forming regions like orion and taurus show a wealth of protostellar jets . for more than sixty years",
    "they have been studied observationally , theoretically and , more recently , numerically .",
    "these different approaches allowed to conclude that protostellar jets are also accretion powered collimated outflows , ejected episodically from the inner part of the accretion disks with the help of a magnetic field .",
    "supersonic variations in the ejection velocity produce herbig - haro ( hh ) objects as emitting post - shock cooling regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some of the hh objects have a knotty structure , while other have a bow - shaped form .",
    "it is still a matter of debate whether there is a contribution of a collimated stellar wind component , or a broad , non - collimated disk wind component , and if the ejections are periodic or not .",
    "also , jets launched from the accretion disks are believed to rotate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if measured , the rotation of the jet with respect to its axis would give an estimation of the amount of angular momentum extracted from the star - disk system .",
    "this is a key parameter that can be used to understand the origin of protostellar jets , and might also help to understand the general mechanism responsible for the production of astrophysical jets at different scales .",
    "recent observations of hh jets show transverse velocity shifts in several emission lines .",
    "@xcite first observed a shift in the h@xmath3 lines for the molecular jet hh212 .",
    "@xcite observed the dgtau micro - jet , much closer to the central source and in atomic lines , finding a similar shift in several emission lines .",
    "other authors observed later a larger sample of objects getting similar results : @xcite , @xcite for class ii objects , @xcite for class i objects and @xcite for class 0 ( or 0/i ) objects .    from these results ,",
    "important consequences on the jet ejection mechanism have been inferred .",
    "different models predict that jets are ejected from different regions of the disk .",
    "for instance , in the `` x - wind '' scenario the jet is ejected from the region of interaction between the protostar s magnetosphere and the disk @xcite , while in the `` disk - wind scenario '' , the jet is magnetocentrifugally ejected from an extended portion of the disk surface @xcite .",
    "if interpreted as rotation , observations imply a range of ejection radii around @xmath4au ( e.g. @xcite ) , therefore excluding the x - wind as possible mechanism for the jet ejection , and favoring the disk - wind scenario . on the other side , recently @xcite determined wind launching radii @xmath5au , consistent with the x - wind model @xcite kms@xmath1 for the dg tau jet , while @xcite have used @xmath6 kms@xmath1 for hh212 molecular outflow , and they have found @xmath7 au and @xmath8 au , respectively . ] .    in agreement with the rotation interpretation of the data , jet and counter - jet",
    "rotate in the same sense in the th28 and rwaur jets . in both cases , nevertheless , the sense of rotation observed in the disk and the jet are opposite @xcite . in other cases",
    "the observations did not detect any rotation given the limits of resolution of the observations ( hh30 in @xcite and @xcite , hh212 in @xcite , rytau in @xcite ) .",
    "puzzling , recent near - uv observations @xcite of the rwaur jet showed velocity shifts which , if interpreted as rotation , give a sense of rotation consistent with that of the disk ( but opposite with respect to previous optical observations ) , which were not detectable anymore in following - up near - uv observations six months later at levels above the limiting resolution of the observations @xcite .",
    "while most of the studies have interpreted the presence of velocity shifts as due to the rotation of the jet material , a few works have studied alternative mechanisms .",
    "* hereafter cer06 ) , using numerical simulations , showed that jet precession may lead to velocity shifts similar to those observed , while @xcite proposed disk asymmetries as a possible alternative mechanism . among the observed t tau jets with velocity shifts ,",
    "dgtau has observed precession @xcite and the model developed by cer06 may be applied to this jet .",
    "@xcite have also inferred , through radio observations , that the molecular outflow associated with a t - tauri star in the cb26 bok globule ( in taurus - aurigae ) is rotating .",
    "they have suggested that the outflow is also precessing . for these cases",
    ", it seems plausible that the effects of precession should be carefully taken into account when considering radial velocity shifts as a fiducial evaluation for jet rotation .",
    "more recently , @xcite investigated the origin of the radial velocity shift ( of the order of 2 km s@xmath1 ) observed in the hh797 outflow . in order to explain the observed data , they have considered both precession and rotation , concluding that rotation may probably account for the shifts .",
    "it seems at a first glance , however , that the hh797 jet is precessing , as it is suggested by the wiggling of the outflow far from the driving source ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we critically analyze the key hypothesis done implicitly when interpreting the observed velocity shifts as rotation : the absence of side to side ( i.e. , with respect to the jet axis ) velocity asymmetries .",
    "in particular , we will show analytically ( section [ sec2 ] ) and by numerical models ( section [ sec3 ] ) that the presence of velocity asymmetries may generate effects resembling those observed , i.e. , that there is a degeneracy between toroidal and asymmetric poloidal velocities , which can be disentangled only by a statistical analysis of a large sample of hh jets . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we discuss the results , and in section [ sec5 ] we draw our conclusion .",
    "observations of transverse velocity shifts ( tvs ) are commonly interpreted as evidence of jet rotation .",
    "this is valid as long as the dominant component in the radial velocity is the rotation velocity .",
    "all the previous observational efforts done in order to estimate the tvs are based on the assumption that the jet velocity is symmetric across the jet radius , and that the tvs are only due to the presence of a given rotational profile .",
    "nevertheless , the poloidal jet velocity , which can have a large variability even for a given jet @xcite , is a key point to infer ( from the observational point of view ; see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the region at the surface of the accretion disk where the outflow is actually produced / launched .",
    "a herbig - haro jet has a typical poloidal velocity of 100 - 200kms@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a side to side ( with respect to the jet axis ) gradient in the jet velocity ( hereafter , a `` velocity asymmetry '' ) can also contribute to the observed tvs .",
    "to better illustrate this point , in this section we will compute synthetic position - velocity diagrams and , analyzing them similarly to how is done by observers , we will demonstrate that rotation and velocity asymmetries produce similar tvs .",
    "then , we will show how it is possible to understand the origin of tvs by a statistical analysis of the existing data",

    "we use equation [ eq : iyv ] to compute synthetic position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams . from the pv diagrams we extract intensity profiles at positions symmetric with respect to the jet axis .",

    "therefore , observations of radial velocity shifts in a jet do not allow to determine with precision the amount of rotation and velocity asymmetry present in the jet , unless the jet is moving nearly in the plane of the sky .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] also shows that the tvs produced by rotation and velocity asymmetry strongly depend on the jet inclination angle .",

    "a comparison between figure [ fig5 ] and figure [ fig6 ] also shows that the result is nearly independent ( at least qualitatively ) from the particular dependence of the rotation velocity with radius considered . in figure",

    "in this paper , we analyze the origin of velocity shifts observed in protostellar jets .",
    "three - dimensional numerical simulations presented in section [ sec3 ] confirm the results of section [ sec2 ] : radial velocity shifts strongly depend on the jet inclination angle and scale with respect to rotation as @xmath142 and side to side velocity asymmetries as @xmath143 .",
    "an interesting difference between the results of the numerical simulations and the observations is the behavior of the velocity shifts for different emission lines . while in the simulations the [ ] @xmath1446300 and the [ ] @xmath1446731 emission lines have a similar behavior , in the observations by @xcite the [ ] @xmath1446300 line exhibits velocity shifts much larger than those observed in the [ ] @xmath1446731 emission line ( but",
    "these two lines follow a similar behavior in the radial shifts measured by @xcite for the dgtau micro - jet ) .",
    "emission line intensities strongly depend on the jet density profile .",
    "the setup of our simulations considers the same abundance for a given atom ( with respect to hydrogen ) at the jet inlet .",
    "in addition , in the simulations presented in this paper we have followed the `` standard '' recipe of injecting a jet with a top - hat density profile while a `` real '' jet has a density profile larger on the jet axis ( see , e.g. , the electron density profile of the hh30 jet reconstructed by tomographic techniques by @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the adopted top - hat velocity and density profiles can actually affect a direct comparison with the observations .",
    "one could think that the results presented in section [ sec2 ] depend strongly on the hh30 data which , moving nearly in the plane of the sky and with very low values of @xmath61 , favor a model with low rotation and large velocity asymmetry .",
    "this is actually not the case , as the results are not strongly dependent on the hh30 data .",
    "in fact , a fit computed without including the hh30 emission lines gives @xmath145 kms@xmath1 , @xmath146 kms@xmath1 , and @xmath147 for the [ ] line , and @xmath148 kms@xmath1 , @xmath149 kms@xmath1 , and @xmath150 for the [ ] line , then confirming that velocity asymmetries are an important component of the radial velocity shifts , at least at large jet inclination angles .    as a consequence ,",
    "jets with low inclination angles should be preferentially used to properly infer the amount of rotation occurring in the velocity shifts . among the jets considered here ,",
    "hh30 is nearly in the plane of the sky but , as mentioned above , does not show radial velocity shifts larger than the statistical error .",
    "th28 has a small inclination angle ( @xmath151 ) with respect to the plane of the sky , and presents large velocity shifts .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec2 ] , if a side to side spatial asymmetry is present in an emission line profile , it becomes very important to address the effect of the asymmetry ( possibly due to an asymmetric shock ) on the interpretation of the velocity shift as due to rotation .    in general large scale stellar jets",
    "are very asymmetric and irregular , while small scale jets exhibit some degree of symmetry .",
    "several jets among those used to measure rotation in jets show asymmetries in the physical parameters .",
    "@xcite , using data from stis , determined the physical parameters ( electron and hydrogen density , temperature , and ionization fraction ) from pv diagrams in the red - shifted rwtau and th28 jets , and in the blue - shifted dgtau , hh30 and cwtau jets . among these jets ,",
    "th28 , which , as mentioned above , is the most promising jet to infer rotation from radial velocity shift , presents a very clear side to side asymmetry in the electron density , while temperature and ionization fraction are nearly symmetric .",
    "the dgtau jet presents also a strong asymmetry in the electron density , while hh30 and rwaur are nearly symmetric ( at least , at the position where the slit is located and with the resolution of stis ) . for the th28 and dgtau jets ,",
    "the more obvious explanation for the origin of the asymmetry in the electron and total density is the existence of an asymmetry in the jet velocity .",
    "several processes , which can create asymmetries in the jet , have been extensively studied , mainly theoretically .",
    "they can be of `` internal '' origin , i.e. due to a non - symmetric injection velocity from the star disk system ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or of `` external '' origin , i.e. due to the jet environment , originated for instance by hydrodynamics of magnetohydrodynamics instabilities ( e.g. , `` kink '' modes ) , by lateral gradients in the density of a stratified interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the presence of photoionization @xcite , a wind on one side of the jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or , in general , the motion of the source with respect to the environment .",
    "for example , the hh30 jet shows a small bending from distances of order of 400 au from the central source @xcite .",
    "as the effect needed to explain the observed velocity shift is quite small ( @xmath152% of the observed poloidal jet velocity ) , the required amount of asymmetry is often smaller than the one discussed in the cited papers .",
    "several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have considered , from the observation of transverse shifts , the implications on the jet ejection models , showing that the observation are consistent with the disk - wind ejection mode .",
    "our results imply that jet rotation , if present , is probably smaller than the values inferred by previous authors .",
    "that does not imply necessarily that the rotation at the base of the jet is small .",
    "shocks , jet expansion , entrainment , can all potentially lead to a `` loss of memory '' of the material with respect to the original rotation , as discussed for instance by @xcite for magnetohydrodynamics shocks in a helical magnetic field .",
    "recent numerical simulations @xcite showed that the signature of rotation in the jet can be even non - keplerian , which means that the signature showed by rw aur , in which the jet seems to rotate in the sense contrary to the disk rotation can , in fact , occur .",
    "this pose an additional difficulty , in our view , to interpret side to side differences in radial velocity as rotation , since we need to trace back the phase of the torsional alfvn wave that is actually producing the outflow at a given point in the jet .",
    "observations of molecular jets in some cases also show small velocity shifts ( @xmath153 a few km s@xmath1 ) which can be interpreted as jet rotation .",
    "although in this paper we have limited our analysis to atomic jets , our conclusions are also applicable to molecular jets , where the rotation features are observed at larger distances from the disk - star system ( both along and across the jet axis ) , i.e. at the `` edge '' of the jet , where the interaction with the environment is expected to be more important .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested that observed tvs could be originated by rotation of the entrained material .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the uncertainties present when interpreting as rotation the velocity shifts observed in atomic protostellar jets .",
    "we have shown that asymmetric shocks , possibly produced as the results of the interaction with the environment or by asymmetries in the ejection velocity from the disk - star system , may produce effects similar to those produced by rotation .",
    "we have also quantified , analytically and by detailed numerical simulations , how in jets with large inclination angles transverse velocity shifts may be dominated by jet asymmetries , while rotation , if present , should dominate in jets with low inclination angles .",
    "the main uncertainties in this study reside in the low statistics existing in our analysis ( only six jets ) and on the fact that we are assuming that rotation and velocity asymmetry are the same for all jets .",
    "the analysis presented here does not pretend to be complete , as other factors ( e.g. , the agreement between the sense of rotation of jet and disk , the poloidal extension of the region showing velocity shifts ) should be considered when analyzing the observed tvs .",
    "nevertheless , by analyzing existing data of a limited sample of atomic protostellar jets , we have clearly shown that velocity asymmetries ( whatever is their origin ) seem to play a very important role in determining the amount of transverse velocity shift present in protostellar jets .",
    "our results imply that only a detailed modeling of the observations , which include all the effects that can potentially play a role in generating velocity shift , combined possibly with numerical simulations or with novel analysis of the data ( e.g. , the principal component analysis suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , should be used to properly determine the presence of rotation .",
    "additionally , the study of rotation has to proceed carefully in jets that present clear side - to - side asymmetries in line emissivity profiles or in the physical parameters . jets with low inclination angles and without large asymmetries ( e.g. , hh30 ) are the ideal candidate to be used to determine an upper limit on the rotation , the angular momentum transfer , and , from there , help distinguishing among different jet ejection models .",
    "our results do now imply that there is not rotation in protostellar jets .",
    "on one side , the rotation can be smaller than expected and/or dominated by shock asymmetries .",
    "on the other side , magnetic shocks , jet expansion , entrainment , among other phenomena , all lead to a `` loss of memory '' of the initial rotation of the jet material as it expands to large distances from the jet ejection region .",
