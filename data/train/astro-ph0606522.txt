    "the antarctic plateau has revealed to be particularly attractive for astronomy since already several years fossat ( 2005 ) , storey et al .",
    "it is extremely cold and dry and this does of this site an interesting candidate for astronomy in the long wavelength ranges ( infrared , sub - millimeter and millimeter ) thanks to the low sky brightness and high atmospheric transmission caused by a low temperature and concentration of the water vapour in the atmosphere ( valenziano & dalloglio 1999 , lawrence 2004 , walden et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the antarctic plateau is placed at high altitudes ( the whole continent has an average height of @xmath4 @xmath5 m ) , it is characterized by a quite peculiar atmospheric circulation and a quite stable atmosphere so that the level of the optical turbulence ( @xmath3 profiles ) in the free atmosphere is , for most of the time , lower than above whatever other mid - latitude sites ( marks et al .",
    "1996 , marks et al . 1999 , aristidi et al .",
    "2003 , lawrence et al .",
    "gillingham ( 1991 ) , suggested for the first time , such a low level of the optical turbulence above the antarctic plateau .",
    "atmospheric conditions , in general , degrade in proximity of the coasts . a low level of optical turbulence in the free atmosphere is , in general , associated to large isoplanatic angles ( @xmath6 ) . the coherence wavefront time ( @xmath7 ) is claimed to be particularly large above the antarctic plateau due to the combination of a weak @xmath3 and a low wind speed all along the whole troposphere . under these conditions ,",
    "an adaptive optics system can reach better levels of correction ( minor residual wavefront perturbations ) than those obtained by an equivalent ao system above mid - latitude sites .",
    "wavefront correction at high zernike orders can be more easily reached over a large field of view , the wavefront - corrector can run at reasonably low frequencies and observations with long exposure time can be done in closed loop .",
    "this could reveal particularly advantageous for some scientific programs such as searches for extra - solar planets .",
    "of course , also the interferometry would benefit from a weak @xmath3 and @xmath7 .    in the last decade several site testing campaigns took place , first above south pole ( marks et al .",
    ", 1996 , loewenstein et al . 1998 , marks et al . 1999 , travouillon et al . 2003a , travouillon 2003b ) and , more recently , above dome c ( aristidi et al .",
    "2003 , aristidi et al . 2005a , lawrence et al .",
    "dome c seems to have some advantages with respect to the south pole : * ( a ) * the sky emission and atmospheric transparency is some order of magnitude better than above south pole ( lawrence 2004 ) at some wavelengths .",
    "the sensitivity ( depending on the decreasing of sky emission and increasing of transparency ) above dome c is around 2 times better than above south pole in near to mid - infrared regions and around 10 times better in mid to far - infrared regions . *",
    "( b ) * the surface turbulent layer , principally originated by the katabatic winds , is much more thinner above dome c ( tens of meters - aristidi et al .",
    "2005a , lawrence et al . 2004 ) than above south pole ( hundreds of meters - marks et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the thickness and strength of the surface turbulent layer is indeed tightly correlated to the katabatic winds , a particular wind developed near the ground characterizing the boundary layer circulation above the whole antarctic continent .",
    "katabatic winds are produced by the radiative cooling of the iced surface that , by conduction , cools the air in its proximity .",
    "the cooled air , in proximity of the surface , becomes heavier than the air in the up layers and , for a simple gravity effect , it moves down following the ground slope with a speed increasing with the slope .",
    "dome c is located on the top of an altiplano in the interior region of antarctica and , for this reason , the katabatic winds are much weaker above dome c than above other sites in this continent such as south pole placed on a more accentuated sloping region .    at present",
    "not much is known about the typical values of meteorological parameters above dome c during the winter ( april - september ) time i.e. the most interesting period for astronomers .",
    "the goals of our study are the following .",
    "we intend to provide a complete analysis of the vertical distribution of the main meteorological parameters ( wind speed and direction , absolute temperature , pressure ) in different months of the year using european center for medium weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) data .",
    "a particular attention is addressed to the wind speed , key element for the estimate of the wavefront coherence time @xmath7 .",
    "the ecmwf data - set is produced by the ecmwf general circulation model ( gcm ) and is therefore reliable at synoptic scale i.e. at large spatial scale .",
    "this means that our analysis can be extended to the whole troposphere and even stratosphere up to @xmath8-@xmath0 km .",
    "the accuracy of such a kind of data is not particularly high in the first meters above the ground due to the fact that the orographic effects produced by the friction of the atmospheric flow above the ground are not necessarily well reconstructed by the gcms .",
    "we remind to the reader that a detailed analysis of the wind speed near the ground above dome c extended over a time scale of @xmath8 years was recently presented by aristidi et al .",
    "( 2005a ) . in that paper , measurements of wind speed taken with an automatic weather station ( aws ) ( @xmath9 )",
    "are used to characterize the typical climatological trend of this parameter . in the same paper",
    "it is underlined that estimates of the temperature near the ground are provided by schwerdtfeger ( 1984 ) .",
    "the interested reader can find information on the value of this meteorologic parameter above dome c and near the surface in these references .",
    "our analysis can therefore complete the picture providing typical values ( seasonal trend and median values ) of the meteorological parameters in the high part of the surface layer , the boundary layer and the free atmosphere .",
    "thanks to the large and homogeneous temporal coverage of ecmwf data we will be able to put in evidence typical features of the meteorological parameters in the summer and winter time and the variability of the meteorological parameters in different years .",
    "the winter time is particularly attractive for astronomical applications due to the persistence of the _",
    "night time _ for several months .",
    "this period is also the one in which it is more difficult to carry out measurements of meteorological parameters due to logistic problems .",
    "for this reason ecmwf data offer a useful alternative to measurements for monitoring the atmosphere above dome c over long time scales in the future .",
    "we intend to study the conditions of stability / instability of the atmosphere that can be measured by the richardson number that depends on both the gradient of the potential temperature and the wind speed : @xmath10@xmath11@xmath10(@xmath12,@xmath13 ) .",
    "the trigger of optical turbulence in the atmosphere depends on both the gradient of the potential temperature ( @xmath12 ) and the wind speed ( @xmath13 ) i.e. from the @xmath10 .",
    "this parameter can therefore provide useful information on the probability to find turbulence at different altitudes in the troposphere and stratosphere in different period of the year .",
    "why this is interesting ?",
    "at present we have indications that , above dome c , the optical turbulence is concentrated in a thin surface layer . above this layer",
    "the @xmath14 is exceptionally large indicating an extremely low level of turbulence .",
    "the astronomic community collected so far several elements certifying the excellent quality of the dome c site and different solutions might be envisaged to overcome the strong surface layer such as rising up a telescope above @xmath15 m or compensating for the surface layer with ao techniques .",
    "the challenging question is now to establish more precisely how much the dome c is better than a mid - latitude site . in other words , which are the _ typical _ @xmath16 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 that we can expect from this site ?",
    "we mean here as _",
    "typical _ , values that repeat with a statistical relevance such as a mean or a median value .",
    "for example , the gain in terms of impact on instrumentation performances and astrophysical feedback can strongly change depending on how weak the @xmath3 is above the first @xmath15 m. in spite of the fact that @xmath3@xmath11@xmath17 , @xmath3@xmath11@xmath18 or @xmath3@xmath11@xmath19 are all small quantities , they can have a different impact on the final value of @xmath16 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "only a precise estimate of this parameter will provide to the astronomic community useful elements to better plan future facilities ( telescopes or interferometers ) above the antarctic plateau and to correctly evaluate the real advantage in terms of turbulence obtained choosing the antarctic plateau as astronomical site . with the support of the richardson number , the wind speed profile and a simple analytical @xmath3 model we will try to predict a @xmath2 and a @xmath1 without the contribution of the first @xmath15 m of atmosphere . data provided by ecmwf can be used as inputs for atmospheric meso - scale models usually employed to simulate the optical turbulence ( @xmath3 ) and the integrated astroclimatic parameters ( masciadri et al . 2004 , masciadri & egner 2004 , masciadri & egner 2005 ) .",
    "measurements of wind speed done during the summer time have been recently published ( fig . 1 - aristidi et al .",
    "we intend to estimate the quality and reliability of the ecmwf data comparing these values with measurements from aristidi et al .",
    "so to have an indication of the quality of the initialization data for meso - scale models .",
    "we planned applications of a meso - scale model ( meso - nh ) to the dome c in the near - future .",
    "as a further output this model will be able to reconstruct , in a more accurate way than the ecmwf data - set , the meteorologic parameters near the ground .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section [ meteo ]",
    "we present the median values of the main meteorological parameters and their seasonal trend .",
    "we also present a study of the richardson number tracing a complete map of the instability / stability regions in the whole @xmath0 km on a monthly statistical base . in section [ rel ]",
    "we study the reliability of our estimate comparing ecmwf analysis with measurements . in section [ disc ]",
    "we try to retrieve the typical value of @xmath2 and @xmath1 above dome c. finally , in section [ conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the characterization of the meteorological parameters is done in this paper with _",
    "analyses _ extracted by the catalog mars ( meteorological archival and retrieval system ) of the ecmwf .",
    "an _ analysis _ provided by the ecmwf general circulation ( gcm ) model is the output of a calculation based on a set of spatio - temporal interpolations of measurements provided by meteorological stations distributed on the surface of the whole world and by satellite as well as instruments carried aboard aircrafts .",
    "these measurements are continuously up - dated and the model is fed by new measurements at regular intervals of few hours .",
    "the outputs are formed by a set of fields ( scalar and/or vectors ) of classical meteorological parameters sampled on the whole world with a horizontal resolution of @xmath20@xmath21 correspondent to roughly @xmath22 km .",
    "this horizontal resolution is quite better than that of the ncep / ncar reanalyses having an horizontal resolution of @xmath23@xmath21 so we can expect more accurate estimate of the meteorological parameters in the atmosphere .",
    "the vertical profiles are sampled over @xmath24 levels extended up to @xmath24 km .",
    "the vertical resolution is higher near the ground ( @xmath4 @xmath25 m above dome c ) and weaker in the high part of the atmosphere . in order to give an idea of the vertical sampling , fig .",
    "[ mars ] shows the output of one data - set ( wind speed and direction , absolute and potential temperature ) of the mars catalog ( extended in the first @xmath15 km ) with the correspondent levels at which estimates are provided .",
    "we extracted from the ecmwf archive a vertical profile of all the most important meteorological parameters ( wind speed and direction , pressure , absolute and potential temperature ) in the coordinates ( 75@xmath21 s , 123@xmath21 e ) at @xmath26:@xmath26 u.t . for each day of the 2003 and 2004 years .",
    "we verified that the vertical profiles of the meteorologic parameters extracted from the nearest 4 grid points around the dome c ( 75@xmath21@xmath27@xmath28 s , 123@xmath21@xmath29@xmath30 e ) show negligible differences .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the orography of the antarctic continent is quite smoothed and flat in proximity of dome c. above this site we can appreciate on an orographic map a difference in altitude of the order of a few meters over a surface of @xmath24 kilometers ( masciadri 2000 ) , roughly the distance between 2 contiguous grid points of the gcm .",
    "the orographic effects on the atmospheric flow are visibly weak at such a large spatial scale on the whole @xmath0 km .",
    "we can therefore consider that these profiles of meteorologic parameters at macroscopic scale well represent the atmospheric characteristics above dome c starting from the first ten of meters as previously explained .",
    "the wind speed is one among the most critical parameters defining the quality of an astronomical site .",
    "it plays a fundamental role in triggering optical turbulence ( @xmath3 ) and it is a fundamental parameter in the definition of the wavefront coherence time @xmath7 :    @xmath31 ^{-3/5 } \\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the wavelength , v the wind speed and @xmath3 the optical turbulence strength .",

    "figure [ year_wind ] ( c ) shows the variability of the median profiles obtained during the two years .",
    "we can observe that from a qualitative ( shape ) as well as quantitative point of view ( values ) the results are quite similar in different years .",
    "they can therefore be considered as typical of the site . due to the particular synoptic circulation of the atmosphere above antarctica ( the so called _ polar vortex _ )",
    "the vertical distribution of the wind speed in the summer and winter time is strongly different .",
    "the wind speed has important seasonal fluctuations above @xmath33 km .",
    "figure [ win_sum_wind ] shows the median vertical profiles of the wind speed in summer ( left ) and winter ( right ) time in 2003 ( top ) and 2004 ( bottom ) .",
    "we can observe that the wind speed is quite weak in the first @xmath4@xmath33 km from the sea - level during the whole year with a peak at around @xmath34 km from the sea level ( @xmath35 km from the ground ) .",

    "* above @xmath33 km from the sea level , the wind speed is extremely weak during the summer time but during the winter time , it monotonically increases with the height reaching values of the order of @xmath15 m / sec ( median ) at @xmath8 km .",
    "the typical seasonal wind speed fluctuations at @xmath35 and @xmath8 km are shown in fig.[wind_free ] .",

    "it is worth to underline the same wind speed vertical distribution appears in different years in the same month . only during the august month it is possible to appreciate substantial differences of the median profile in the 2003 and 2004 years .",
    "this result is extremely interesting permitting us to predict , in a quite precise way , the typical features of the vertical distribution of wind speed in different months .",

    "we can observe that , in only @xmath8@xmath41 of cases , the wind speed reaches values of the order of @xmath8 m / sec during the winter time .",
    "this height ( @xmath34-@xmath40 km ) corresponds to the interface troposphere - tropopause above dome c. as it will be better explained later , this is , in general , one of the place in which the optical turbulence can be more easily triggered due to the strong gradient and value of the wind speed .",

    "this value is much smaller above dome c than above mid - latitude sites .",
    "we can therefore expect a less efficient production of turbulence at dome c than above mid - latitude sites at this height .",
    "figure [ seas_wind_dir ] shows , for each month , the median vertical profile of the wind direction during 2003 ( green line ) and during 2004 ( red line ) .",
    "we can observe that , during the all months , in the low part of the atmosphere the wind blows principally from the south ( @xmath4@xmath42@xmath21 ) . in the troposphere ( @xmath43-@xmath44 km ) the wind changes , in a monotonic way , its direction from south to west , north / west ( @xmath4@xmath45@xmath21 ) . in the slab characterized by the tropopause and stratosphere ( above @xmath44 km )",

    "the value of @xmath48 indicates the level of the atmospheric thermal stability that is strictly correlated to the turbulence production .",
    "when @xmath49 is positive , the atmosphere has high probabilities to be stratified and stable",
    ". we can observe ( fig.[seas_pot_temp ] ) that this is observed in the ecmwf data - set and it is particularly evident during the winter time . another way to study",
    "the stability near the ground is to analyse the @xmath50 , i.e. the gradient of the absolute temperature .",
    "when @xmath50 is positive , the atmosphere is hardly affected by advection because the coldest region of the atmosphere ( the heaviest ones ) are already in proximity of the ground .",
    "this is a typical condition for antarctica due to the presence of ice on the surface but it is expected to be much more evident during the winter time due to the extremely low temperature of the ice",
    ". we can observe ( fig.[seas_abs_temp ] ) that during the winter time , @xmath51 is definitely positive near the ground indicating a strongly stratified and stable conditions .",
    "all this indicates that some large wind speed gradient on a small vertical scale have to take place to trigger turbulence in the surface layer in winter time .",
    "we discuss these results with those obtained from measurements in section [ rich ] .",
    "a further important feature for the vertical distribution of the absolute temperature is the inversion of the vertical gradient ( from negative to positive ) in the free atmosphere indicating the interface troposphere - tropopause in general associated to an instable region due to the fact that @xmath49 @xmath52 @xmath19 .",
    "we can observe that , above dome c , this inversion is located at around @xmath34 km from the sea level during all the months . in the summer time , the median vertical profile of the absolute temperature is quite similar to the one measured by aristidi et al .",

    "however the temperature during the winter time , above the minimum reached at @xmath34 km , does not increase in a monotonic way with the height but it shows a much more complex and not unambiguous trend from one month to the other with successive local minima and a final inversion from negative to positive gradients at @xmath8 km ( may , june , july and august ) and @xmath25 km ( september and october ) . considering that the regions of the atmosphere in which @xmath49 @xmath52 @xmath19 favour the instability of the atmosphere ( see section [ rich ] )",
    ", the analysis of the absolute temperature in the @xmath34-@xmath0 km range tells us that , at least from the thermal point of view , it is much more complex and difficult to define the stability of the atmosphere during the winter time than during the summer time .",
    "the richardson number maps ( section [ rich ] ) will be able to provide us some further and more precise insights on this topic .",
    "we finally observe that , during all the months , the vertical distribution of the absolute temperature is reproduced identically each year .",
    "the stability / instability of the atmosphere at different heights can be estimated by the deterministic richardson number @xmath10 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the gravity acceleration @xmath55 m@xmath56s@xmath57 , @xmath58 is potential temperature and @xmath59 is the wind speed .",
    "the stability / instability of the atmosphere is tightly correlated to the production of the optical turbulence and it can therefore be an indicator of the turbulence characteristics above a site .",

    "these kind of fluctuations in the atmosphere have a typical small spatial scale and can be detected by radiosoundings .",
    "when one treats meteorological parameters described at lower spatial resolution , as in our case , it is not appropriate to deal about a deterministic richardson number . following a statistical approach ( van zandt et al .",
    "1978 ) , we can replace the deterministic @xmath10 with a probability density function , describing the stability and instability factors in the atmosphere provided by meteorological data at larger spatial scales .",
    "this analysis has already been done in the past by masciadri & garfias ( 2001 ) .",

    "we can predict the development of the turbulence but probably characterized by an inferior strength than what observed above mid - latitude sites .",
    "the wind speed at @xmath69 $ ] km above dome c is , indeed , clearly weaker than the wind speed at the same height above mid - latitude sites .    in the high part of the atmosphere ( @xmath71 @xmath60 @xmath35 km ) , during the summer time the atmosphere is , in general , quite stable and we should expect low level of turbulence .",
    "during the winter time the atmosphere is more instable and one should expect a higher level of turbulence than during the summer time .",
    "the optical turbulence above @xmath33 km would be monitored carefully in the future during the months of september and october to be sure that @xmath7 is competitive with respect to mid - latitude sites in winter time .",
    "indeed , even a weak @xmath3 joint to the large wind speed at these altitudes might induce important decreasing of @xmath7 with respect to the @xmath7 found above mid - latitude sites .",
    "indeed , as can be seen in fig.[seas_wind ] , the wind speed at this height can be quite strong .",
    "on the other side , we underline that this period does not coincide with the central part of the winter time ( june , july and august ) that is the most interesting for astronomic observations .",
    "we would like to stress again this concept : in this paper we are not providing absolute value of the turbulence but we are comparing levels of instabilities in different regions of the atmosphere and in different periods of the year .",

    "we said that during the winter time and near the ground , the thermal stability is larger than during the summer time .",
    "this is what the physics says and what the ecmwf data - set show but it is in contradiction with seeing measurements .",
    "the only way to explain such a strong turbulent layer near the ground during the winter time is to assume that the wind speed gradient in the first @xmath15 m is larger during the winter time than during the summer time .",
    "this is difficult to accept if the wind speed is weaker during the winter time than during the summer time as stated by aristidi et al .",
    "as shown in masciadri ( 2003 ) , the weaker is the wind speed near the surface , the weaker is the gradient of the wind speed .",
    "we suggest therefore a more detailed analysis of this parameter near the surface extended over the whole year .",
    "this should be done preferably with anemometers mounted on masts or kites .",

    "2005a ) can be useful to quantify the level of reliability of our estimates . in aristidi",
    "et al . ( 2005a ) is shown ( fig.4 ) the median vertical profile of the wind speed measured during several nights belonging to the summer time .",
    "figure 1 in aristidi et al.(2005a ) gives the histogram of the time distribution of measurements as a function of month .",
    "most of measurements have been done during the december and january months .",
    "figure [ mean_wind_dec_jan ] ( our paper ) shows the vertical profile of the wind speed obtained with ecmwf data related to the december and january months in @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( bold line ) and the measurements obtained during the same months above dome c ( thin full line ) .",
    "e. aristidi , member of the luan team , kindly selected for us only the measurements related to these two months from their sample .",
    "we note that , the ecmwf are all calculated at @xmath26:@xmath26 u.t . while the balloons were not launched at the same hour each day .",
    "moreover , the measurements are related to 2000 - 2003 period while the analyses are related to the 2003 - 2004 period . in spite of this difference ,",
    "the two mean vertical profiles show an excellent correlation .",
    "the absolute difference remains below @xmath43 m / sec with a mean difference of @xmath87 m / sec basically everywhere .    in the high part of the atmosphere ( fig.[mean_wind_dec_jan ] ) ,",
    "the discrepancy measurements / ecmwf analyses is of the order of @xmath88 @xmath89 .",
    "this is a quite small absolute discrepancy but , considering the typical wind speed value of @xmath4 @xmath90 @xmath89 at this height , it gives a relative discrepancy of the order of @xmath0@xmath41 .",
    "we calculated that , assuming measurements of the seeing so far measured above dome c and @xmath3 profiles as shown in section [ disc ] ( table 2 ) , this might induce discrepancies on the @xmath7 estimates of the order of @xmath91-@xmath92@xmath41 . to produce a more detailed study on the accuracy of the ecmwf analyses and measurements one should know the intrinsic error of measurements and the scale of spatial fluctuations of the wind speed at this height .",
    "no further analysis is possible for us above the dome c to improve the homogeneity of the samples ( measurements and analyses ) and better quantify the correlation between them because we do not access the raw data of measurements .",
    "we decided , therefore , to compare measurements with ecmwf analyses above south pole in summer as well as in winter time to provide to the reader further elements on the level of reliability of ecmwf analyses above a remote site such as antarctica .",
    "figure [ jan_med ] ( january - summer time - @xmath36 nights ) and fig.[jj_med ] ( june and july - winter time - @xmath36 nights ) show the median vertical profiles of wind speed , wind direction and absolute temperature provided by measurements ] and ecmwf analyses .",
    "we underline that , in order to test the reliability of ecmwf analyses , we considered all ( and only ) nights for which measurements are available on the whole @xmath0 @xmath93 for the three parameters : wind speed , wind direction and absolute temperature . it was observed that , during the winter time , the number of radiosounding ( balloons ) providing a complete set of measurements decreases . in this season",
    "it is frequent to obtain measurements only in the first @xmath33-@xmath36 @xmath93 . above this height",
    "the balloons blow up . to increase the statistic of the set of measurements extended over the whole @xmath0 @xmath93 we decided to take into account nights related to two months ( june and july ) in winter time",
    ". we can observe ( fig.[jan_med ] , fig.[jj_med ] ) that the correlation ecmwf analyses / measurements is quite good in winter as well in summer time for all the three meteorologic parameters .",
    "we expressly did not smoothed the fluctuations characterized by high frequencies of measurements .",
    "the discrepancy measurements / ecmwf analyses is smaller than @xmath43 @xmath89 on the whole troposphere .",
    "it is also visible that the natural typical fluctuations at small scales of the measured wind speed is @xmath4 @xmath43 @xmath89 .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that a correlation measurements / ecmwf analyses within @xmath43 m / sec error is a quite good correlation and these data - set can provide reliable initialization data for meso - scale models.as a further output of this study we observe that , during the winter time , the wind speed above south pole is weaker than above dome c , particularly above @xmath34 km from the ground .",
    "this fact certainly affects the value of the @xmath7 placing the south pole in a more favourable position with respect to dome c. on the other side , we know that the turbulent surface layer is much more stronger and thicker above south pole than dome c. this elements also affects the @xmath7 placing dome c in a more favourable position with respect to south pole .",
    "further measurements are necessary to identify which of these two elements ( a larger wind speed at high altitudes above dome c or a stronger turbulence surface layer above south pole ) more affects the @xmath7 . indeed , if typical values of @xmath7 ( @xmath94 msec ) in winter time ( june , july and august ) above south pole are already available ( marks et al .",
    "1999 ) , we have not yet measurements of @xmath7 above dome c related to the same period .",
    "of course , if @xmath7 above dome c will reveal to be larger than @xmath94 msec , this would mean that the stronger turbulence layer in the surface above south pole affects @xmath7 more than the larger wind speed at high altitudes above dome c. this study is fundamental to define the potentialities of these sites for applications to the interferometry and adaptive optics .",
    "we intend here to calculate the value of @xmath6 , @xmath7 in the slab of atmosphere in the range [ h@xmath95 , h@xmath96 using , as inputs , simple analytical models of the optical turbulence @xmath3 and the median vertical profiles of the wind speed shown in fig.[win_sum_wind ] .",
    "the superior limit ( h@xmath97 ) is defined by the maximum altitude at which balloons provide measurements before exploding and falling down .",

    "the simplest ( and less realistic ) assumption is to consider the @xmath3 constant over the [ h@xmath95 , h@xmath96 range . to calculate the @xmath3 we use three values of references : @xmath16@xmath11@xmath101 , @xmath16@xmath11@xmath102 and @xmath16@xmath11@xmath103 .",
