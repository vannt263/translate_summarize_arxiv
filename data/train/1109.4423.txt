    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are extragalactic sources that are not at the nucleus of their galaxy and emit well above the eddington limit of a @xmath2 black hole ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the most important , still unresolved question is whether these objects contain intermediate mass black holes - imbhs - ( @xmath4 ) or stellar mass black holes with super - eddington or beamed emission ( see @xcite for a review ) .    a direct answer regarding the mass of compact objects in ulxs would be possible if a radial velocity curve of absorption lines from the companion star , or emission lines coming from the accretion disk , could be obtained . to date",
    ", this has been proven to be a real challenge due to the lack of absorption lines in ulx optical spectra and what seem to be non - periodic variations of the only traceable emission line in holmberg  ix  x-1 and ngc  1313  x-2 @xcite .",
    "the only exception , to date , is the optically very luminous source p13 in ngc  7793 @xcite where absorption lines from a late b supergiant star ( in addition to a emission line ) have been observed .",
    "this is a very promising candidate to constrain the mass function of the system .",
    "however , this is the only example out of more than ten identified optical counterparts .    in all other ulxs , the true nature of the donor star is mostly unknown .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve of m82  x-1 shows a 62 day periodicity consistent with a strictly periodic signal and hence is likely the orbital period of the binary system @xcite .",
    "if the companion star fills its roche lobe , this means that such star has to be of low - density and hence would be a giant or supergiant star @xcite .",
    "other constraints on the nature of the donor stars rely on studies of their environment . indeed , some counterparts belong to or are located nearby small stellar associations ( @xcite ) , where it is possible to constrain the association age , and thus the maximum mass for a member star .",
    "this has led to maximum mass estimates of @xmath5 that apply as well to the donor star of the ulx systems , if mass transfer did not play an important role . in some other cases",
    "@xcite , the constraints arise from field stars in the absence of such associations . but these estimates are based on indirect evidence and the precise stellar type of those stars remains unknown .",
    "the most obvious problem in identifying the companion star in the optical emission of ulxs is that the flux contribution coming from the accretion disk ( direct and irradiated ) is not known but is definitely present in some sources .",
    "the best hint comes from ngc  1313  x-2 , where its optical lightcurve is contaminated by short - term , stochastic variations that are likely due to x - ray reprocessing in the accretion disk @xcite and also from x - ray heating in the companion star @xcite .",
    "broad emission lines with equivalent widths up to ten times higher than in the brightest galactic high - mass x - ray binaries are present in the optical spectrum of some counterparts ( e.g. @xcite ) and are also a direct proof of significant x - ray reprocessing in these systems .    the counterpart optical colors have often been used to place constraints on the companion star .",
    "the high optical / uv luminosities and blue colors suggest early - type , ob stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . but , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , the optical light may be contaminated , or even dominated , by the irradiated accretion disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is similar to active low - mass x - ray binaries , although ulxs have higher x - ray luminosities and may have more massive donor stars . unfortunately",
    ", the optical spectral energy distributions of hot , irradiated disks look rather like those of ob stars .",
    "our present work is devoted to a well studied ulx , ngc  5408  x-1 ( hereafter n5408x1 ) , .",
    "n5408x1 is a bona - fide ulx with an average luminosity ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) of @xmath6 @xcite that displays clear variability within a factor of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "monitoring of the source has been used to infer a @xmath8 period that has been interpreted as the orbital period of the ulx system @xcite , although @xcite suggests that this modulation may instead be superorbital .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of n5408x1 does not seem to vary much @xcite .",
    "all observations performed to date show a soft spectrum @xmath9 and the presence of a soft component .",
    "different interpretations have been put forward : if interpreted in the framework of galactic black holes binaries ( gbhbs ) , standard models ( powerlaw plus disk component ) point to the presence of a massive black hole if the temperature of the disk scales as in galactic counterparts @xcite .",
    "the power - law would be in that case the signature of a corona as seen in gbhbs .",
    "instead , the interpretation in the context of super - critical accreting systems would mean that the black hole is much smaller , with the possibility that a strong wind is the origin of the soft component , while the high energy part of the spectrum would be due to disk emission inside the spherization radius @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the soft component may represent emission from the outer disk with the hard emission associated with thermal comptonization @xcite .",
    "n5408x1 is also one of the few ulxs where quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been discovered @xcite .",
    "by analogy with galactic black hole binaries ( gbhbs ) , @xcite have interpreted this feature as a type c low - frequency qpo ( lfqpo ) , which would indicate that n5408x1 hosts an imbh . @xcite",
    "have challenged this conclusion and concluded that even the most super - eddington bhb , grs 1915 + 105 , is not really a good match to the properties of n5408x1 .",
    "they hypothesized that the temporal and spectral properties are more consistent with the feature seen in narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies which are supposed to be even higher super - eddington sources , which would indicate a black hole with mass @xmath10 .",
    "but the large uncertainties associated with the black hole masses in those systems avoids any definitive conclusion .",
    "n5408x-1 is also seen at other wavelengths .",
    "this source is one of the few ulxs detected in radio , the emission being consistent with a powerful nebula surrounding the ulx @xcite .",
    "this nebula is also detected in optical wavelengths @xcite where the optical emission is consistent with x - ray photoionization .",
    "the optical counterpart of the ulx , first uniquely identified in a _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_/wfpc2 image by @xcite as a @xmath11 magnitude object , has been subsequently studied using vlt spectroscopy by @xcite and @xcite . the optical spectrum of n5408x1 is similar to many other ulxs , displaying a blue continuum with superimposed strong and narrow emission lines coming from the nebula . of prime interest",
    "is the presence of broad components with widths of @xmath12 in the and @xmath13 lines @xcite that appear spatially point - like , similar to the optical continuum of the counterpart .",
    "the radial velocity of the broad line varies , which may represent the motion of the compact object or motions within the accretion disk ( see @xcite for the behavior of this line in other sources ) .",
    "in this paper , we present new , simultaneous _ chandra_/_hst _ observations of n5408x1 .",
    "_ hst _ observations that allow us to present for the first time the spectral energy distribution of a ulx from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths",
    ". combined with simultaneous x - ray data , we are able to show that an irradiated disk model fits well all the data .",
    "we discuss other alternatives and suggest a way to confirm this result with new observations .",
    "we obtained three series of multiwavelength observations using the recently installed wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) instrument aboard the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    "( program i d 12010 , pi : p. kaaret , along with simultaneous _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations ( program i d 11400085 , pi : p. kaaret ) .",
    "each _ hst _ visit consisted of observations in uv , optical , and near - infrared filters .",
    "uv and optical observations were carried out in the f225w , f336w , f547 m , and f845 m filters using the wfc3/uvis camera .",
    "we used the wfc3/ir camera for the near - infrared observations , in the f105w and f160w filters .",
    "a single observation was done with the wfc3/uvis using the narrow f502n filter to isolate emission due to the forbidden [ ] @xmath145007 line .",
    "a summary of the observations can be found in table [ obs ] .",
    "we performed aperture and point - spread function ( psf ) photometry on the drizzled images .",
    "aperture photometry was done only on the four uvis images , since the crowding is really severe in the infrared images , preventing any reliable photometry in the region nearby the ulx with this method .",
    "we performed the aperture photometry with sextractor v. 2.5.0 @xcite , using an aperture of 2 pixels in radius ( i.e , 0.08 ) .",
    "the background was estimated by relying on the global mapping done by sextractor .",
    "aperture corrections were calculated using relatively bright and isolated stars , performing photometry using a 0.4  radius ( i.e. 10 pixels ) .",
    "psf photometry was performed using daophot  ii @xcite under eso - midas . for the uvis images",
    ", we used a 2.5 pixel aperture ( i.e. @xmath15 ) which corresponds approximately to 60 - 70% of the enclosed energy @xcite depending on the filter .",
    "the background was chosen to be a 10 pixel width annulus located at 15 pixels from the object centroid . given the use of a sub - array for the uvis observations , we used a constant psf across the frame .",
    "aperture corrections were calculated using the aperture photometry routine within the daophot package in the same way as previously described .",
    "a similar procedure was applied to the ir images , with a 2.0 pixel aperture ( i.e. @xmath16 ) , corresponding to 70 - 80% of the enclosed energy @xcite .",
    "the ir observations were performed in full frame mode , thus we used a quadratically varying psf in the field .",
    "aperture corrections were measured as for the uvis images . finally , zeropoints calculated for a @xmath17 radius were taken out of @xcite for uvis and ir observations .",
    "it turns out that the main uncertainty in the photometry is due to the aperture correction .",
    "indeed , the use of a window for the uvis observations means that the number of bright stars is low which forces us to rely on fewer stars , or less bright stars , for the correction .    in the rest of this paper , we will use the results coming from the psf photometry , but the two methods give consistent results for bright or isolated stars , with differences below 0.1 mag .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another possibility is that the emission in excess from the extrapolation of the disk may not come primarily from a stellar component .",
    "the irradiated disk model that we used is able to fit all the data quite well ( see table [ tab_diskir ] ) .",
    "all three datasets give similar results within the errors , which is expected given the lack of significant variability both at x - rays and at lower energies . in this model ,",
    "the uv / optical / ir emission is from the irradiated outer disk that thermalizes a fraction of the bolometric luminosity @xmath18 .",
    "this fraction is higher than seen from galactic x - ray binaries in the thermal dominant state @xcite but similar fractions have been obtained from observations of the microquasar grs1915 + 105 in its most x - ray active phase @xcite .    l*10cr",

    "@xcite have discussed the size of the accretion disk in n5408x1 , based on the broad emission lines seen in the optical spectrum of the counterpart .",
    "they concluded that the disk has a radius lower than @xmath50 which translates to @xmath51@xmath52 for a @xmath53@xmath54 black hole .",
    "according to the results from the irradiated disk model , we found that the disk would have a size @xmath55 depending on the inclination of the disk .",
    "this is comparable to the size of the disk inferred in grs1915 + 105 with @xmath56 , where an irradiated accretion disk may also be present @xcite . in n5408x1 ,",
    "the irradiated disk model gives @xmath57@xmath58 which is in the upper range of other ulxs , like in ngc  1313  x-1 @xcite with @xmath59@xmath60 and in ngc 6946 x-1 @xcite with @xmath61@xmath62 .",
    "while disk irradiation is able to explain the observational properties of n5408x1 , we can not make a definitive statement that irradiation is occurring in this system .",
    "first , no detection of significant , associated variability between the uv / optical / nir and x - ray has been made ( see below ) .",
    "second , it is possible that the x - ray soft component is not emitted by an accretion disk , but by the photosphere of an outflow / wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) that would be due to supercritical accretion onto the accretion disk .    in that context , it may be interesting to draw a comparison with the x - ray transient v4641 sgr .",
    "this is an interesting source because it may be a closer example to ulxs than low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) thanks to its companion that is a quite massive star ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "v4641 sgr went into outburst in 1999 reaching an x - ray luminosity near or above the eddington limit of its @xmath64 black hole @xcite .",
    "along with the x - ray outburst , the optical emission increased by at least 4.7 mag .",
    "it has been shown that irradiation in the accretion disk can not be reconciliated with the observed parameters . instead ,",
    "@xcite argue that an extended envelope surrounding the source absorbs the x - ray flux and reemits it in the optical and uv",
    ". this would be the signature of a massive outflow driven by the supercritical accretion .",
    "the optical nebulae present around some ulxs and around n5408x1 ( figure [ image ] ) argue for the presence of such outflows .",
    "as noted in @xcite the difficulty with the supercritical model is that the soft x - rays expected from the photosphere of the wind would not thermalize in the disk and thus would not contribute to the reprocessed emission in the optical bands .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the supercritical accretion models because they predict geometric beaming @xcite .",
    "if the irradiated disk model is valid , it means that such beaming can be ruled out in n5408x1 , because of the high fraction of thermalized bolometric luminosity in the disk .",
    "this would challenge the supercritical model . on the contrary ,",
    "if the optical spectrum is dominated by the donor emission , then mild geometric beaming consistent with the constraints from the surrounding 4686 nebula would be allowed . thus confirming or not that the optical emission comes mainly from the donor star is important .",
    "observing x - ray / optical correlated variability would be a direct test of the irradiated disk model .",
    "a lack of significant optical variability in response to a significant x - ray variation would rule out the model , and would probably argue for the dominance of the companion star at non - x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the x - ray variability we measure is limited , with a 40% change in the count rate between the first and last observation , and with the second observation displaying a flux consistent with that of the first one . at longer wavelengths",
    ", there is no clear , statistically significant variability in the _ hst _ filters . in practically all filters ,",
    "the magnitudes in all three epochs are consistent within the errors ( table [ tab_magnitudes_hst_hoix ] ) , with only marginal evidence of variability between the first and third epoch , at a level @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we can only provide an upper limit on the variability in the _ hst _ filters , consistent with @xmath66 in most filters .",
    "if the situation is comparable as that of lmxbs , we would expect the amplitude of optical variability to be roughly the square root of the amplitude of the x - ray variability .",
    "our results are not inconsistent with this because the x - ray variability would imply a change of the optical flux of only @xmath6718% , which is close enough to 10% and also because other processes can affect the optical luminosity of the system with approximately the same amplitude ( i.e. , ellipsoidal variations ) .",
    "perhaps the best evidence of variability may be seen in the normalization of the power - law fits . at 5500   the difference in the normalization factors between the first and last observation is @xmath68 which is almost significant at a @xmath69 level .",
    "we tried to look for a correlation between the x - ray flux and the magnitude / normalization in all filters but the errors on both parameters are too large ( see figure [ corr_fx_fopt ] ) .",
    "the long term x - ray light curve of n5408  x-1 measured with _",
    "swift _ shows dips quite regularly @xcite , with the x - ray luminosity decreasing by nearly an order of magnitude compared to the long - term average . in the context of an irradiated disk",
    ", this would imply a drop in the optical flux by a factor @xmath70 , i.e. @xmath71 and thus would be easily measurable .",
    "@xcite noted that this reprocessing signature is approximate , depending on parameters such as the size of the disk , but given the order of magnitude of the variability that we expect , it should still be detectable , even if reduced , in the uv / optical / nir sed of the source . finally , another additional signature would be an associated decrease in the flux of the emission line visible in the optical spectrum of the source @xcite , if the emission of is really associated with reprocessing in the accretion disk .",
    "thus , it would be of interest to perform optical observations during an x - ray dip .",
    "we have studied ngc  5408  x-1 using 3 epochs of simultaneous _",
    "chandra_/_hst _ observations .",
    "the optical counterpart of the ulx is visible from the uv to the nir .",
    "hst_/wfc3 observations reveal that the souce is located near a young , @xmath67 5 myr old , ob association containing massive stars up to @xmath1 , with a few blue supergiants",
    ". this could be the birthplace of the ulx system , but it can not be ruled out that it was formed instead in a superstar cluster in ngc  5408 .",
    "the uv to nir sed is compatible with that of a b0i supergiant star . using the simultaneous x - ray data , we show that the intrinsic emission of a standard accretion disk can not explain the uv / optical / nir fluxes .",
    "instead , a model that takes into account irradiation in the disk fits well all the data .",
    "further test of this model requires observing the source with a lower or higher x - ray flux and studying the correlation with the optical flux .",
    "this would be a good discriminant toward determining the physical origin of the optical emission .",
