    "the rabi model , which was introduced over 70 years ago , describes the important interaction between a two - level system and a quantized harmonic oscillator ( bosonic mode ) @xcite .",

    ", the rabi model has not been solved exactly because it is hard to find a second conserved quantity besides the energy .",
    "the well - known method to obtain the energy spectrums and the wavefunctions for the rabi model is the numerical diagonalization in a truncated finite - dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",
    "however , these numerical results are difficult to extract the fundamental physics of the rabi model crisp , lamata , zhu , gerritsma , larson , larson1,larson2 and to precisely control the experimental parameters to process quantum information @xcite .    to overcome the problem in the analytical considerations , the rotating - wave approximation , which is valid in the regime @xmath8 , was proposed to rewrite hamiltonian ( [ rm ] ) as @xcite @xmath9interestingly , the jaynes - cummings model with @xmath10 symmetry has a conserved quantity @xmath11 , and thus , it can be solved easily in the subspaces @xmath12",
    ". meanwhile , the jaynes - cummings model can successfully describe quantum dynamics of optical cavity electrodynamics with strong coupling .",
    "however , in the recent investigations about the solid - state quantum electrodynamics with the ultrastrong coupling ( @xmath13 ) gunter , anappara , todorov , fedorov , hofheinz , lahaye , niemczyk , peropadre , geiser , albert , the rotating - wave approximation breaks down and the system s dynamics must be governed by the rabi model .",

    "we first map the unsolvable rabi model ( [ rm ] ) into a solvable jaynes - cummings - like model by choosing a proper variation parameter , as shown in section ii .",
