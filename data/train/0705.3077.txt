    "the quantum logic circuit model , initiated by feynman and deutsch , has been more prominent than quantum turing machines in research into quantum computing .",
    "however quantum turing machines have been studied for at least two major reasons :    a.   quantum turing machines form a class closely related to deterministic and probabilistic turing machines , the basis for the theory of classical computation which is well developed and quite well understood .",
    "b.   quantum logic circuits are devices purpose built for one specific application whereas quantum turing machines are devices that ( like ordinary turing machines ) can be used to operate on arbitrarily large inputs and that can ( possibly  this depends on the existence of a universal device in the same class ) be programmed .",
    "programmability also allows a program - based notion of complexity .    since a quantum turing machine ( qtm )",
    "could in principle operate for an indefinite number of steps , the interaction between the operator / observer and the apparatus is of crucial importance .",
    "specifically , the operator needs to be able to tell when s / he may disturb the device and observe the output .",
    "this makes the halting of a quantum turing machine a quite delicate issue ( as also mentioned in @xcite for example ) and this paper examines the solution proposed by deutsch , which is part of the standard description of the qtm .",
    "since quantum turing machines are based on the ordinary turing machine , we start by reviewing the classical model . by the beginning of the twentieth century mathematicians",
    "had become quite interested in establishing a formal model of computability . in response ,",
    "alan turing described an abstract device in 1936 , now called a _ turing machine _ , which follows a simple , finite set of rules in a predictable fashion to transform finite strings ( input ) into finite strings ( output , where defined ) .",
    "the turing machine ( tm ) can be imagined to be a small device running on a two - way infinite tape with discrete cells , each cell containing only the symbol * 0 * or * 1 * or a blank .",
    "the tm has a finite set of possible internal states and a head that can read the contents of the cell of the tape immediately under it .",
    "the head may also , at each step , write a symbol to the cell over which it finds itself .",
    "there are two special internal states : an _ initial state _ @xmath0 and a _ halt state _ @xmath1 .",
    "a tm has a finite list of instructions , or _",
    "transition rules _ , describing its operation .",
    "there is at most one transition rule for each combination of cell content ( under the head ) and internal state .",
    "if the internal state is @xmath2 and the head is over a cell with content @xmath3 then the machine looks for a rule corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "if no rule is found , the machine enters the halting state immediately .",
    "if a rule corresponding to @xmath4 is found , it will tell the machine what to write to the cell under the head , whether to move left or right and which internal state to enter .",
    "there is no transition rule corresponding to the halting state .",
    "sometimes we refer to the entire collection of individual rules for all the different @xmath4 as _ the transition rule _ of the machine .",
    "a _ computation _ consists of starting the tm with the head over the first non - blank cell ( which we may label position 0 on the tape ) from the left of the tape ( it is assumed that there is nothing but some finite _ input _ on the tape ) and the machine in internal state @xmath0 .",
    "now the transition rules are simply applied until the machine enters the halting state @xmath1 , at which point the content of the tape will be the _ output _ of the computation .",
    "if , for some input , the machine never halts then the output corresponding to that input is simply undefined .",
    "it is clear how every tm defines a ( possibly , partial ) function @xmath5 from the set of counting numbers to itself .",
    "turing machines are the canonical models of computing devices .",
    "no deterministic device , operating by finite ( but possibly unbounded ) means has been shown to be able to compute functions not computable by a turing machine .",
    "in fact , one may view one s desktop computer as a turing machine with a _",
    "finite _ tape .",
    "a probabilistic turing machine ( ptm ) is identical to an ordinary turing machine except for the fact that at each machine configuration @xmath6 there is a finite set of transition rules ( each with an associated probability ) that apply and that a random choice determines which rule to apply .",
    "we fix some threshold probability greater than even odds ( say , 75% ) and say that a specific ptm computes @xmath7 on input @xmath8 if and only if it halts with @xmath7 as output with probability greater than 75% .",
    "the _ quantum turing machine _ ( qtm ) was first described by david deutsch @xcite . the basic idea is quite simple ,",
    "a qtm being roughly a probabilistic turing machine ( ptm ) with complex transition amplitudes ( the squared moduli of which add up to one at each application ) instead of real probabilities .",
    "the qtm is related to the classical deterministic tm in much the same way as the ptm is .    in the following the _ classical machine _ is a machine with a two - way infinite tape , starting over position 0 on the tape as described above , that we use as a kind of template for the quantum turing machine .",
    "the corresponding quantum turing machine ( qtm ) might work as follows ( based on the deutsch description @xcite , ozawa @xcite , bernstein and vazirani @xcite ) .",
    "a.   the quantum state space of the machine is spanned by a basis consisting of states @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the halt qubit , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a configuration of the corresponding classical machine , where @xmath13 denotes the position of the head , @xmath14 the internal state of the machine and @xmath15 the non - blank content of the tape .",
    "b.   special initial and terminal internal states have been identified ( corresponding to the initial state and halting state of the classical machine ) . c.   the single transition rule is now a unitary operator @xmath16 which , in each step , maps each basic @xmath17 to a superposition of only finitely many @xmath18 , where 1 .",
    "the rule is identical for @xmath19 and @xmath20 when @xmath21 in position @xmath8 and @xmath22 in position @xmath23 have the same content , i.e. the rule depends only on the content of the tape under the head and the internal state @xmath24 and not on the position of the head or on the content of the rest of the tape ; 2 .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 differ at most in position @xmath8 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath27 ( depending on whether the corresponding classical machine moves one position to the left , to the right , or not at all ) ; 4 .",
    "@xmath28 if and only if @xmath29 is the halting state of the classical machine ; and 5 .",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 whenever @xmath33 .",
    "+ finitely many subrules @xmath34 will determine @xmath16 as there are , by the stipulations above , only finitely many possible  given that the alphabet of the tape ( binary in our case ) and the number of internal states are both finite .",
    "note that the transitional rule ( `` program '' ) will have a finite specification only if the transition amplitudes in the superposition of the @xmath18 are all _ computable _ complex numbers , which we will of course assume to be the case throughout .",
    "the transition rule can also , obviously , be extended ( linearly ) to finite superpositions of @xmath17 .",
    "d.   the machine is started with a finite superposition of inputs @xmath35 because of the form that the transition rule is allowed to take ( and the fact that there are only finitely many internal machine states ) the machine will be in the superposition of only _",
    "finitely many _",
    "basic states @xmath17 at any step during the entire run of computation .",
    "the description of the machine given here differs from a classical reversible turing machine in two obvious respects .    1 .",
    "transition rules are allowed to map a state of the machine to the superposition of several states .",
    "the crucial distinction with classical probabilistic machines is that the qtm goes to a quantum superposition of states whereas the classical ptm can be seen as either going to a classical probability distribution over states or to a specific state with some classical probability .",
    "quantum computing , of course , uses superposition in an essential way  as in the the algorithms of shor or grover .",
    "the input is allowed to be a superposition of a finite number of `` classical '' inputs .",
    "it is not immediately obvious why a finite collection of specifications of the form ( [ eqtr ] ) should necessarily define a unitary @xmath16 , however , just as it might not be apparent why a finite collection of rules @xmath36 for a classical machine would necessarily specify a reversible machine .",
    "unitarity is , of course , a precondition for the quantum device to be feasible .",
    "we start by assuming that the operator @xmath16 described above is what is often called _ well - formed _ , i.e. that the subrules of the form ( [ eqtr ] ) give rise to a unitary operator . without loss of generality",
    "everything can be assumed to be coded in binary so that each position on the tape will correspond to a single qubit ( quantum bit ) .",
    "a unit of quantum information , the qubit is a two level quantum mechanical system , whose state is described by a linear superposition of two basis quantum states , often labelled @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the actual ( quantum ) state space of the machine will be a direct sum of @xmath39-qubit spaces ( where @xmath39 is an indication of how much tape has been used , each @xmath39-qubit space being the @xmath39-fold tensor of the single qubit space ) .",
    "the direct sum is , however , not a _ complete _ inner - product space ( i.e. not a hilbert space ) and therefore  by the postulates of quantum mechanics  not a valid state space .",
    "however , the underlying hilbert space can be taken to be the completion of the direct sum and a unitary operator @xmath16 on the direct sum ( see @xcite ) can be extended to a unitary operator @xmath40 on the hilbert space .",
    "this completed space and operator will correspond to the physical system associated with the qtm , thereby taking care of the _ physicality _ of the qtm , provided that @xmath16 was _ well - formed_.    to see that well - formedness of @xmath16 is not a triviality , consider a putative qtm with initial state @xmath0 and final state @xmath1 . let the following subrules define the machine : @xmath41 these subrules specify that the machine starts out by replacing a 0 under the head by a superposition of 0 and 1 , leaves a 1 initially under the head unchanged and then halts ( i.e. enters a final state in which the tape head only may still move ) . given a classical input , it could be said to operate reversibly as we can recover the input from the output .",
    "however , the putative qtm is not _ well - formed _ and therefore not a real qtm at all since @xmath42 but @xmath43 is certainly not perpendicular to @xmath44 at all . a possibly correct version of the same machine",
    "could perhaps be given by @xmath45 for example , as the previous objection has been eliminated .",
    "the constraint of unitarity clearly excludes certain combinations of transition rules and directly implies that a great deal of care should be taken to ensure well - formedness of any machine that one may construct .",
    "if @xmath16 is the operator that describes one application of the transition rule ( i.e. one step in the operation ) of the machine , then the evolution of an unobserved machine ( where not even the halt bit is measured ) for @xmath39 steps is simply described by @xmath46 . if the first measurement occurs after @xmath47 steps , and the measurement is described by an operator @xmath48 then the evolution of the machine for the first @xmath49 steps is described by @xmath50 which is in general no longer unitary since the operator @xmath48 is a measurement ( always in the computational basis ) .",
    "it is important to note that the machine evolves unitarily only when no measurement takes place at all .",
    "the quantum turing machine should therefore not be seen as a pure quantum device but as a kind of hybrid device .",
    "actually , as will be discussed below , the output from operating the machine for @xmath39 steps without measurement of the halt bit is equivalent to operating it for @xmath39 steps and observing the halt bit after every step .",
    "however , the qtm is envisioned with no explicit limit on the number of steps for which it may run , so the whole machine is evidently not equivalent to any single quantum experiment .",
    "the output of the machine on the tape is of course a superposition of basis states and should be read off after having measured the content of the halt bit and finding it in the state 1 .",
    "the operator may at any time , or indeed between every two applications of @xmath16 , measure the halt bit in order to decide whether to read the tape content ( and collapse the state of the machine to one of the basis states ) .",
    "the halt bit is intended to give the operator of the machine an indication of when an output may be read off from the tape ( and by observation collapsing the system to an eigenstate ) without interfering excessively with the computation .",
    "it seems that deutsch s original idea was that there would be no entanglement at all between the halt bit and the rest of the machine , but this can not be guaranteed , as desribed by myers @xcite .",
    "the _ output _ of a qtm for some specific input @xmath8 ( which may be a superposition of classical inputs ) is a probability distribution @xmath51 over all possible contents of the tape at the time of observing the halt bit to have been activated .",
    "actually , miyadera and ohya @xcite have provided a simple proof that it is not possible to effectively distinguish between those quantum turing machines which have deterministic and those which have probabilistic halting behaviour .      in an ordinary qtm",
    "the evolution of the machine continues even when the halt bit has been observed , and can continue after the halt bit has been observed without perturbing the probability distribution that has been defined to be the qtm s _ output _ ( ozawa @xcite ) since the observation projects one , in a certain sense , only into a specific ( @xmath52 or @xmath33 ) branch of the computation .",
    "let us consider this idea in slightly more detail .",
    "suppose @xmath16 describes a qtm with a proper halting scheme , as above .",
    "by this we mean that @xmath16 is unitary and that if @xmath53 is a halting configuration that occurs ( maybe in a superposition ) during the evolution of the machine for some valid input , then @xmath54 for some @xmath23 .",
    "this simply means that @xmath16 satisfies condition iii(e ) of section [ sec : def ] which is sufficient to guarantee this .",
    "assume that the qtm is in a state @xmath55 after @xmath56 applications of @xmath16 and ( scenario 1 ) that the halt bit is not measured at this point .",
    "one may assume @xmath57 and @xmath58 to be normalised , of course , and since @xmath59 and @xmath60 are orthogonal .",
    "] , @xmath61 apply @xmath16 once more , to get @xmath62 since @xmath16 is unitary and because of iii(e ) @xmath63 and furthermore @xmath64 for some normalised @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath67 therefore the state of the device is now @xmath68 it follows from unitarity of @xmath16 that since @xmath59 is orthogonal to @xmath60 it must also be the case that @xmath69 is orthogonal to @xmath70 .",
    "in other words @xmath71 but @xmath72 is orthogonal to @xmath73 and hence the three normalised states @xmath74 are pairwise orthogonal .",
    "the probability of now measuring an activated halt bit is therefore @xmath75 which is greater than at the previous step , as one might expect .",
    "unsurprisingly , if ( scenario 2 ) we had measured the halt bit one step earlier then we would have read off an activated state with probability @xmath76 and an inactive halt bit with probability @xmath77 .",
    "having measured an inactive halt bit would have collapsed the state of the machine to @xmath60 which , after another appplication of @xmath16 would give @xmath78 observing the halt bit now would show an activated state with probability @xmath79 .",
    "classical probability calculus , given that the events are mutually exclusive and using bayes formula , yields a probability of having observed an activated halt bit after the last step of scenario 2 as @xmath80 which is then the same as the probability of measuring it after the last step of scenario 1 .",
    "the preceding elementary exposition illustrates the idea developed by ozawa in @xcite .",
    "that paper considers the probability of observing the tape of the machine in a specific state @xmath26 with the halt bit activated , either ( i ) by observing the halt bit after @xmath47 steps ( and possibly reading of the content of the tape then , if the halt bit was activated ) and then again after another @xmath81 steps or by ( ii ) just letting the machine run without observation and after @xmath82 steps measuring the halt bit ( and possibly the tape ) .",
    "ozawa showed that the probability of observing the specific state @xmath26 of the tape is identical in the two cases .",
    "it should perhaps be noted that in ozawa s description the position of the head on the tape is considered part of the tape , whereas it has been explicitly separated in this contribution .",
    "this does not detract in any essential way from ozawa s result .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "myers @xcite pointed out that it must be possible to find a qtm in a superposition of basic states with the halt bit activated and basic states with the halt bit not ( yet ) active . among other reasons , this is simply true because if @xmath8 is an input for which the machine takes @xmath83 steps to active the halt bit and @xmath23 is an input for which it takes @xmath84 steps , then the machine , when the input is a superposition of @xmath8 and @xmath23 , will  between the @xmath83-th and @xmath85-th step  find itself in such a superposition .",
    "this emphasises the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum turing machines , as also pointed out clearly by miyadera and ohya @xcite and is not an objection _ per se _ , as ozawa @xcite has shown .",
    "kieu and danos @xcite purport to have shown the impossibility of any unitary operator @xmath16 having the desired halting scheme .",
    "they argue as follows .",
    "suppose there exists a state @xmath86 of the machine such that @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the identity operator , and there exists an @xmath89 such that @xmath90 let @xmath91 further be the smallest number for which relation ( [ eq1 ] ) holds .",
    "such a @xmath86 could constitute the qtm prepared with a valid input that eventually activates the halt bit  at least a little bit  and",
    "@xmath91 would be the number of applications of @xmath16 necessary for any chance of observing an activated halt bit . if no such @xmath86 exists then the machine described by @xmath16 has no input leading to a positive probability of an output and is , in other words , useless . kieu and danos proceed to observe correctly that ( in our notation ) @xmath92 because of the minimality of @xmath91 and therefore , since @xmath16 is unitary , @xmath93 this is then supposed to contradict ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "it would be true if , as stated in the kieu and danos paper , the subspace @xmath94 spanned by the @xmath95 were identical to the subspace @xmath96 spanned by the @xmath97 .",
    "kieu and danos appear to presume that the restriction @xmath98 of @xmath16 to @xmath94 is unitary , from which it would indeed follow that @xmath99 , but this presumption is without proof .",
    "of course , @xmath98 does preserve the inner product but it is not necessarily unitary because its range need not span all of @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , @xmath98 being unitary ( i.e. @xmath99 ) would _ directly _ imply that no @xmath86 as above exists . in @xcite the same assumption ( that @xmath98 , denoted @xmath100 there , is unitary ) appears to have lead to the same conclusion .",
    "concerns about the halting scheme were raised also by shi @xcite , albeit in the context originally introduced by deutsch , where superpositions @xmath55 with @xmath101 are assumed not to occur .",
    "shi had actually been examining the existence of universal quantum computers where the halting scheme is very relevant to the discourse .",
    "consider a general countable class of machines that compute partial functions , i.e. functions that are not necessarily defined for all inputs .",
    "assume that each machine is fully described by a natural number .",
    "let @xmath102 denote the random variable ( not simply function , since the machine is not assumed to be deterministic ) computed by machine @xmath39 and fix a reasonable @xmath103 which will be used for the encoding of programs and data as a single input .",
    "[ deftwo ] if there exists a number @xmath91 such that @xmath104 which means that the functions are either equal and both defined or both undefined if deterministic , and if not deterministic then the values have the same distribution , for all @xmath39 and @xmath105 , then the machine described by @xmath91 is called a _ universal _",
    "machine for the class .",
    "programmability follows from universality and this is why universality is such an important concept .",
    "a universal turing machine , for example , can simulate all the turing machines , and is thus programmable for the entire class of turing machines . in spite of very powerful results by bernstein and vazirani",
    "@xcite , universality in the sense of the definition above has not ( yet ) been established @xcite .",
    "the observation of the halt bit goes quite far in explaining why not .",

    "@xmath106 would have to be run for @xmath117 , reset and run for @xmath118 and so on , for an unknown but finite number of times .",
    "the problem is that after each run of @xmath106 ( for example , for @xmath119 ) the resetting to the original input value is no longer necessarily possible  because the observation of the halt bit could actually have caused the familiar measurement - related collapse of the state of the machine times . ] from @xmath55 to either @xmath59 or @xmath60 . of course ,",
    "at that point an operator could step up and reprogram the machine , but such an intervention would clearly violate the principle of autonomy of operation of the device in the same way that it would if a desktop computer were unable to perform the not operation and had to request the manual flipping of a switch from an operator each time the unary operator were required .",
    "the halting scheme for quantum turing machines , as proposed by deutsch , is a valid idea  or appears , so far , to be  if one keeps in mind that the operation of the machine will be essentially probabilistic and not deterministic . any classical reversible universal turing machine , which uses the halt bit to identify its single terminal state and which after reaching the terminal state keeps moving the head in one direction , corresponds to a well - formed quantum turing machine since its operation consists of a permutation of the basic states of the machine .",
    "this provides a simple example of one machine for which the halting scheme is obviously valid .",
    "however it is the view of the authors that more research is needed into the power of well - formed quantum turing machines . among other things , although a simulation procedure has been described for arbitrary qtms , it has not been clearly shown whether any universal such machine ( or a machine universal for some subclass ) exists . the halting scheme for quantum turing machines , while providing the means of using them in practice , seems to be a serious impediment in this regard ."
