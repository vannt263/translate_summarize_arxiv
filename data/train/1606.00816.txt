    "since the challenging experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates , our understanding about this state of matter has improved in both theoretical and experimental aspects . nowadays this subject continues being a focus of intense investigations , with the main aim to understand phenomena that occur at the mesoscopic scale .",
    "it is recognized that exactly solvable models allow studies taking into account the whole quantum fluctuations that play an important role at this scale , and at ultra low temperature @xcite . in this direction",
    "the algebraic bethe ansatz method has been an important tool to build new integrable models .",
    "moreover this technique was already used to construct a two - mode integrable model ( _ the two - site bose - hubbard model _ ) @xcite which has been used with success to describe experimental results @xcite .    motivated by this , and the following recent developments :    * experimental efforts to investigate two - well systems with two levels in each well to study epr entanglement @xcite ; * the theoretical paper _ a bosonic multi - state two - well model _ @xcite where two solvable models in the sense of algebraic bethe ansatz method are presented ; * recent discussions about the definition of quantum integrability @xcite .    here",
    "we revisit the ref .",
    "@xcite to provide a full solution for a class of multi - well tunneling models using the algebraic bethe ansatz method .",
    "these models are defined on complete bipartite graphs @xmath0 .",
    "the models are naturally associated with ( @xmath1 ) modes , and integrability requires ( @xmath1 ) conserved operators .",
    "however the standard algebraic bethe ansatz method , via the transfer matrix , provides only two of these conserved operators . on the other hand ,",
    "we show how to obtain the other @xmath2 additional independent conserved operators .",
    "another important aspect is that the method allows us to find a set of pseudovacua .",
    "all pseudovacua allow to build a set of bethe states leading to a complete set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the models .    in the next section we present the models and the generalization of the algebraic bethe ansatz technique .",
    "the approach follows the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite , although with different notational conventions .",
    "we begin by introducing the hamiltonian for ( @xmath1 ) wells in terms of a set of canonical boson operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 and another set @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath7 where we have defined @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 . above",
    ", the coupling @xmath12 is the intra - well and inter - well interaction between bosons , @xmath13 is the external potential and @xmath14 are the constant couplings for the tunneling amplitude .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 are real numbers satisfying @xmath16    we will show that the above models are integrable in the sense of algebraic bethe ansatz , but a generalization is needed . as we will show later , we can obtain just two conserved operators from the standard algebraic method through the transfer matrix , but the generalization of the method allows us to identify @xmath2 additional constant operators . in this sense",
    "we will show that the method presented here is a generalization for the algebraic bethe ansatz method and integrability is a consequence of this generalization .",
    "the study of the above integrable hamiltonians is important , in part , because it generalizes models that have been studied already in the literature . to be more precise : the case @xmath17 is the well - known _ canonical josephson hamiltonian _ @xcite which has been an useful model in understanding tunneling phenomena and has been studied in many aspects @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath18 , in the reference @xcite , was interpreted as an integrable hamiltonian with two wells and two levels in each well .",
    "however it was shown later the solution presented was not complete @xcite .",
    "on the other hand non - integrable variants of these types of models were studied in @xcite . in the reference @xcite a case with two greatly different tunneling rates",
    "was studied as a model for a mesoscopic quantum system in thermal contact .",
    "the quantum dynamics for a range of different initial conditions , in terms of the number of distribution among the wells and the quantum statistics , is presented in ref .",
    "the tunneling dynamics at zero temperature was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate possible ways in which to achieve mass transport around a loop and persistent current . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was pointed out that an appropriate control of short - range and dipolar interaction may lead to novel scenarios for the dynamics of bosons in lattices , including the dynamical creation of mesoscopic quantum superposition , which may be employed in the design of heisenberg - limited atom interferometers .",
    "physically one can say that the hamiltonians ( [ h2n ] ) describe josephson tunneling for bosonic systems in multiple ( @xmath1 ) wells .",
    "besides the apparent simplicity , the models show a rich and beautiful mathematical structure as will be seen in the next sections .      from the above general hamiltonian , for particular choices of @xmath19",
    ", we obtain the following integrable models :      @xmath20      @xmath21      @xmath22    @xmath23      @xmath24    @xmath25      @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28",
    "we start this section applying the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite to discuss the exact bethe ansatz solution for the model ( [ h2n ] ) .",
    "we begin with the standard @xmath29-invariant @xmath30-matrix , depending on the spectral parameter @xmath31 : @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . above",
    ", @xmath35 is a free real parameter .",

    "baxter equation @xmath37 here @xmath38 denotes the matrix acting non - trivially on the @xmath39-th and @xmath40-th spaces and as the identity on the remaining space .",
    "we start with the general lax operator @xmath41 satisfying @xmath42 as a result of the following algebra being satisfied @xmath43= i,\\;\\;\\;[n_x , x]=-x,\\;\\;\\;[n_x , x^{\\dagger}]=x^{\\dagger } , \\qquad x = a , b.\\ ] ]    using the lax operator presented above and the co - multiplication property @xcite , we can obtain a new realization for the monodromy matrix that satisfies the yang - baxter equation through @xmath44 where @xmath45 it can be directly shown that the monodromy matrix satisfies the yang - baxter equation @xmath46 from this identity , there are many commutation relations between the operators @xmath47 .",
    "we present those that are important to our discussion : @xmath48    finally , defining the transfer matrix @xmath49 it follows from ( [ yba1 ] ) that the transfer matrix commutes for different values of the spectral parameter @xmath50=0.\\ ] ] above @xmath51 are conserved operators given by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the identity operator , and the commutation relations @xmath54=0,\\;\\;i , j=0,1,2 $ ] are satisfied .",
    "we observe that independent of @xmath55 and @xmath56 the transfer matrix gives us just two independent conserverd operators ( @xmath57 .",
    "the next step is to derive the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix ( [ tm1 ] ) .",
    "first , to apply the algebraic bethe ansatz method we have to find a pseudovacuum . in the next subsection , we show that to have a complete solution of the model the algebraic method demands a set of pseudovacua .      the bethe states of the system are obtained using a set of @xmath55 dimensional orthonormal vectors , including @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "consider @xmath60 and @xmath61 satisfying @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "now we define the operators @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 and the the following commutation relations are satisfied @xmath67&=0,\\\\ \\lbrack\\overline{\\gamma}_{j},c(u)\\rbrack & = \\eta \\overline{\\gamma}_{j } a^\\dagger , & \\lbrack\\overline{\\gamma}_{j},c^\\dagger(u)\\rbrack&=\\eta a\\overline{\\gamma}_{j},\\nonumber\\\\ \\lbrack n_a,(\\gamma_{j}^{\\dagger})^k \\rbrack&= k(\\gamma_{j}^{\\dagger})^k , & \\lbrack n_b,(\\overline{\\gamma}_{j}^{\\dagger})^k \\rbrack & = k(\\overline{\\gamma}_{j}^{\\dagger})^k.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , denoting @xmath68 , the whole set of pseudovacua can be defined as @xmath69 satisfying the conditions needed for the algebraic bethe ansatz method to work , that is , @xmath70    denoting @xmath71 , the bethe states are given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the tensor product of the @xmath1 vacua for each mode .",
    "the transfer matrix eigenvalue problem is @xmath74 where for @xmath75 the eigenvalues are given by @xmath76 while for @xmath77 the eigenvalues are @xmath78 now it is straightforward to check that the hamiltonian ( [ h2n ] ) is related to the transfer matrix @xmath79 ( [ tm1 ] ) through @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the derivative in function of the spectral parameter and the following identification has been made for the coupling constants @xmath82    the energies of the hamiltonian ( [ h2n ] ) are given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and the set of bethe ansatz equations ( baes ) is given by @xmath85 we remark that in the case @xmath75 there are no associated baes and the energy expression ( [ h2ne ] ) takes the simple form @xmath86\\nonumber \\\\   & = u\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}l_i-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}k_i \\right)^2 + \\mu \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}l_i-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}k_i\\right ) .",
    "\\label{h2nee}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it remains to show that the above method can generate a complete set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the model .",
    "we directly diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ h2n ] ) for two particular cases , and compare the results with those obtained from the algebraic bethe ansatz . see the appendix for details of a three - well and a six - well case , and also @xcite for a four - well case . by numerical inspection we observe that for each bae we have @xmath87 valid solutions while the other solutions are spurious . for fixed @xmath88",
    "there are @xmath89 baes , taking into account the degenerate equations with @xmath90 fixed . considering the above comment that each bae provides @xmath87 eigenstates of the hamiltonian , the total number of eigenstates obtained is @xmath91 which is the dimension of the hilbert space for @xmath92 particles .    when @xmath93 and @xmath94 , note that for @xmath90 fixed it implies that @xmath95 is also fixed .",
    "then there are @xmath96 pseudovacua corresponding to the same bae .",
    "therefore the bethe states obtained from these pseudovacua will be degenerate .",
    "this observation agrees with numerical diagonalization results given in the appendix for the six - well case . when @xmath97 the number of pseudovacua with the same bae is @xmath98 with an analogous formula for when @xmath99 .",
    "each hamiltonian @xmath100 is associated with @xmath1 modes , so integrability requires the existence of @xmath1 independent conserved operators .",
    "the method applied above yields only two independent conserved operators , @xmath101 and @xmath92 , from the transfer matrix . to obtain the other @xmath102 independent conserved operators , we define the operators @xmath103 these operators satisfy the commutation relations @xmath104=[h_{n , m},\\overline{q}_{j}]=[n , q_{j}]=[n,\\overline{q}_{j}]&= 0 \\\\   [ q_{j } , { q}_{k}]=[q_{j } , \\overline{q}_{k}]=[\\overline{q}_{j } , \\overline{q}_{k}]&=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the above @xmath102 operators together with the hamiltonian @xmath101 and the number operator @xmath92 are the @xmath1 independent conserved operators for the model .    on the other hand ,",
    "the conserved operators satisfy the following commutation relations @xmath105=0 , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\",
    "[ \\overline{q}_{j } , c(u)]=0.\\ ] ] it is seen that the bethe states @xmath106 as defined above are eigenstates of the conserved operators @xmath107 and @xmath108 , that is @xmath109 we note that the operators @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) behave like creation ( annihillation ) operators , that is , they satisfy the commutation relation @xmath112=1 $ ] , while the conserved operators @xmath113 have the action of a number operator .",
    "in this work we presented a formulation for quantum integrable multi - well tunneling models through the quantum inverse scattering method and algebraic bethe ansatz techniques .",
    "integrability of the hamiltonian @xmath101 requires the existence of @xmath1 conserved operators , however the transfer matrix gives just two of them .",
    "we show how to compute the other @xmath102 conserved operators and associated with these additional conserved operators is a set of pseudovacuum states .",
    "each pseudovacuum generates a a set of bethe ansatz equations .",
    "it was argued that all pseudovacua are required to obtain a complete set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for each model .    as we were completing this work the preprint @xcite appeared , which discusses the same class of models .    *",
