    "the classical _ schubert varieties _ in the grassmannian @xmath1 parametrize subspaces of dimension @xmath0 ( ` @xmath0-planes ' ) of an ambient vector space @xmath2 , satisfying prescribed incidence conditions with a flag of subspaces .",
    "schubert varieties are among the most studied objects in algebraic geometry , and it may come as a surprise that something is _ not _ known about them . yet , to our knowledge the _ chern classes _ of schubert varieties have not been available in the literature .",
    "this paper is devoted to their computation .",
    "most schubert varieties are singular ; in fact , the only nonsingular schubert varieties are themselves ( isomorphic to ) grassmannians , and computing their chern classes is a standard exercise . for singular varieties , there is a good notion of chern classes in ` homology ' ( i.e. , in the chow group ) , that is , the so - called _ chern - schwartz - macpherson _ ( ` csm ' ) classes .",
    "they were defined independently by marie - hlne schwartz ( @xcite , @xcite ) and robert macpherson ( @xcite ) , they agree with the total homology chern class of the tangent bundle for nonsingular varieties , and they satisfy good functoriality properties ( summarized , for example , in @xcite , example  19.1.7 ) .    it is a consequence of these good functoriality properties classes that a chern - schwartz - macpherson class can in fact be assigned to all schubert _ cells : _",
    "these are varieties isomorphic to affine spaces , parametrizing @xmath0-planes which satisfy prescribed incidence conditions _ strictly . _",
    "every schubert _ variety _ is stratified by the schubert _ cells _ contained in it , and as a consequence the csm class of a schubert variety may be written as a sum of csm classes of schubert cells contained in it .    with this understood ,",
    "our task amounts to the computation of the csm class of a schubert cell , as an element of the chow group of a schubert variety containing it .    in order to state the result more precisely , we have to bring in some notation .",
    "we consider the ` abstract ' schubert variety @xmath3 determined by a partition @xmath4 ; we depict @xmath5 by the corresponding ( upside - down ) young diagram  @xmath5 .",
    "for example , @xmath6 is the schubert variety associated to the diagram        embedding this schubert variety in ( for example ) the grassmannian @xmath7 of @xmath8-planes in a 13-dimensional vector space @xmath2 realizes it as the subvariety parametrizing subspaces intersecting a fixed flag of subspaces of dimensions  @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 in dimension @xmath14 respectively .",
    "it is perhaps more common to associate this latter realization with the ` complementary ' young diagram ,        whose schur function determines the class of @xmath3 in the _ cohomology _ ( or chow ring ) of @xmath7 .",
    "however , since csm classes live in _ homology , _ we are naturally led to take the dual viewpoint .",
    "this also has the advantage of allowing us to deal with schubert varieties as abstract varieties , independently of a ( standard ) embedding into a grassmannian .",
    "the dimension of @xmath3 equals the number of boxes in the corresponding ` homological ' diagram .",
    "we write @xmath15 to denote @xmath16 @xmath17 ; that is , the diagram corresponding to @xmath18 is contained in the diagram corresponding to @xmath5 . for @xmath19 there are closed embeddings @xmath20 ; the schubert _ cell _ @xmath21 is the complement of @xmath22 in @xmath23 .",
    "as mentioned above , schubert cells are isomorphic to affine spaces , and there is a decomposition    @xmath24 it also follows that the chow group @xmath25 is freely generated by the classes @xmath26 $ ] for all @xmath15 . for @xmath15 , the csm class @xmath27 of the corresponding schubert cell",
    "is defined as the image via macpherson s natural correspondence ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of the constructible function @xmath28 whose value is  1 on @xmath29 , and @xmath30 on its complement in @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath31 , the basic covariance property of csm classes implies that @xmath32 reducing the problem of computing csm classes of schubert _ varieties _ to that of computing csm classes of schubert _ cells .",
    "_ now , @xmath33\\ ] ] for uniquely determined coefficients @xmath34 .",
    "our main result consists of the computation of these coefficients , and can be stated in several different forms .",
    "for example :    [ main ] let @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the integer @xmath37 equals the coefficient of @xmath38 in the expansion of the rational function @xmath39 as a laurent polynomial in @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "( even ) more explicitly , the coefficient @xmath37 equals @xmath41_{1\\le i , j\\le d}\\ ] ] where the summation is over the @xmath42 integers @xmath43 , @xmath44 , subject to the conditions @xmath45    other expressions for the coefficients @xmath37 are given in   [ csm ] .",
    "if @xmath46 for @xmath47 , that is , @xmath48 corresponds to a one - row diagram , then @xmath37 equals the coefficient of @xmath49  in @xmath50 ( see corollary  [ onerow ] below ) . for 2-row diagrams @xmath5 , a formula for @xmath37 in terms of non - intersecting lattice paths",
    "is given in theorem  [ latticepaths ] .",
    "[ g25 ] the grassmannian @xmath51 parametrizing lines in @xmath52 is isomorphic to @xmath3 for a @xmath53 rectangle @xmath5 .",
    "we list here the csm classes of its schubert cells , denoting by a darkened diagram @xmath18 the corresponding class @xmath26\\in a_*{{\\mathbb{s}}}({{\\underline\\alpha}})=a_*g_2({{\\mathbb{c}}}^5)$ ] , and by a dot the ` empty ' diagram ( corresponding to the class of a point ) :        for example , the chern - schwartz - macpherson class of @xmath51 may be obtained by adding up all these classes :        as @xmath51 is nonsingular , @xmath54 agrees with the total chern class of its tangent bundle , which may be computed from the standard tautological sequence on the grassmannian .",
    "a number of features of csm classes of schubert cells are clear for ` geometric ' reasons .",
    "for example :    * the contribution of the class of a point to the csm class of a schubert cell is  @xmath9 ; this is necessarily the case , since each cell is an affine space and the degree of the csm class of a variety always equals its euler characteristic ( by functoriality ) ; * _ mutatis mutandis , _ the csm class for a diagram @xmath5 must agree with the csm class for the transposed diagram , obtained from @xmath5 by interchanging rows and columns ; * the csm class for a sequence @xmath55 only depends on the nonzero terms in the sequence .",
    "these facts correspond to identities involving the coefficients @xmath37 computed in theorem  [ main ] , which may appear more mysterious from the ` algebraic ' point of view .",
    "less immediate features include adjunction - type formulas , and interpretations of the coefficients @xmath37 as computing certain nonintersecting lattice paths in the plane ; these are discussed in ",
    "[ pos ] , and follow from the algebraic expressions obtained in   [ csm ] .",
    "there is one feature which is experimentally manifest , and for which we do not know a general proof from either the algebraic or the geometric viewpoint : all coefficients of the csm classes of all schubert cells appear to be _ positive .",
    "_ we give two proofs of this fact for diagrams with @xmath56 rows in  [ pos ] , as consequences of the facts mentioned in the previous paragraph . a proof of positivity for diagrams with @xmath57 rows will appear elsewhere",
    "positivity of chern classes is a well - explored theme in intersection theory ; the case of schubert cells hints that there may be an interesting , and as yet unknown , principle of positivity for chern - schwartz - macpherson classes of singular or noncomplete varieties under suitable hypotheses .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ main ] relies on explicit nonsingular birational models @xmath58 of schubert varieties",
    "@xmath3the well - known _ bott - samelson resolutions _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . in  [ bs ]",
    "we give a self - contained description of these varieties , independent of the embedding of @xmath3 in a grassmannian .",
    "for the application to csm classes it is necessary to compute explicitly the push - forward at the level of chow groups @xmath59 this is accomplished in proposition  [ pfprop ] , and may be of independent interest .",
    "the varieties @xmath58 realize the splitting principle for the tautological bundle @xmath60 on @xmath3 ( obtained as pull - back of the tautological subbundle from a grassmannian ) , so that the chern roots of @xmath60 are realized as chern classes @xmath61 of line bundles @xmath62 on @xmath63 .",
    "we explicitly compute the push - forward to @xmath3 of a monomial in the @xmath64 s , as the class ( up to sign ) of a smaller schubert variety @xmath65 . the reader will check that the classical pieri s formula is an immediate consequence of this observation .",
    "the variety @xmath58 is a nonsingular compactification of the schubert cell @xmath21 , with complement a divisor with simple normal crossing .",
    "the csm class of @xmath21 may then be obtained by computing the ( ordinary ) chern class of a bundle of logarithmic tangent fields on @xmath58 .",
    "this is done in  [ csm ] , leading to explicit expressions for @xmath66 , of which theorem  [ main ] is a sample .",
    "this approach to the computation of chern - schwartz - macpherson classes goes back to an observation ( proposition  15.3 in @xcite , theorem  1 in @xcite ) and has proven useful for other explicit computations .",
    "for example , it gives a one - sentence proof of fritz ehlers formula for the csm class of toric varieties ( @xcite ) .",
    "chern - schwartz - macpherson classes of ( possibly ) singular varieties have been the object of intense study , but they have been computed explicitly in relatively few cases . to our knowledge , the largest class of varieties for which csm classes are known consists of _ degeneracy loci _ of morphisms of vector bundles , satisfying a mild generality hypotheses , which are treated by adam parusiski and piotr pragacz in @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is some overlap of the results in @xcite and in the present paper : schubert varieties indexed by @xmath67 ( that is , by a ` cohomological ' one - row diagram ) may be realized as degeneracy loci . comparing the formulas obtained here with those in _",
    "_ is a natural project .",
    "chern - schwartz - macpherson classes are arguably the most natural replacement for @xmath68 $ ] when the tangent bundle is not available , and computing them for varieties as well - known as schubert varieties is a natural task .",
    "it would also be a natural task to compute other classes satisfying the same basic normalization requirement , such as mather s chern class ( @xcite , example  4.2.9 ) or fulton s chern class ( @xcite , example  4.2.6 ) .",
    "comparisons between these different classes for schubert varieties would lead to the computation of other important invariants of their singularities , such as the local euler obstruction .",
