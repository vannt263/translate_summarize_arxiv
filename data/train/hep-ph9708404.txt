    "each  dis \" workshop in this series has reflected exciting developments from the foregoing year in both theory and experiment .",
    "the organizing committee and argonne national laboratory have made possible another such meeting , distinguished by reports of progress in many directions , reflecting a vibrant and expanding field .",
    "dis 97 was favored as well by strong participation from the hadron and @xmath0collider communities .",
    "the timing for this participation could not have been better , given the fruitful interplay between these complementary arenas in the investigation of the strong interactions .",
    "we shall see examples repeatedly in what follows .",
    "let me begin with a summary of the summary  a set of impressions of the past year for deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) , as represented at this workshop .",
    "1996 - 97 saw the culmination of a set of classic experiments , including final or near - final analyses from nmc @xcite , ccfr @xcite , smc @xcite and e154 @xcite .",
    "each has illuminated hadron structure @xcite in a memorable fashion . from hera @xcite",
    ", we heard of increased coverage in the kinematic range in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , including reports on an excess of  large-@xmath1 and @xmath2 \" events @xcite , which has drawn the attention of the press .",
    "the newly - rich study of dis jet cross sections also affords a wealth of predictions that can be cross - checked in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite . at the same time , a  coming - of - age \" of diffraction and photoproduction @xcite is making possible for the first time truly quantitative studies of these processes , at the boundary of perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics @xcite .",
    "finally , early results from hermes are appearing in the fast - developing program of spin physics in dis and elsewhere @xcite .",
    "theoretical developments @xcite reported at the conference were characterized by the requirements of  precision qcd \" , a concept almost unimaginable fifteen , or even five , years ago .",
    "there is an across - the - board drive toward the calculation of higher - order corrections in perturbation theory , as well as toward the perturbative - nonperturbative interface , through resummed perturbation theory and related methods .",
    "the growing awareness of , and capability for , spin studies has reopened this field to perturbative qcd . under the stimulus of new results , and",
    "projected experiments , theorists are reviving old ideas , inventing new directions , and , in general , struggling to keep up !    in the remainder of this summary",
    ", i can give only selected illustrations of these trends .",
    "it will hardly be possible to do justice even to the few topics i have space to discuss .",
    "more information may , of course , be found from the plenary talks at this conference , and from parallel sessions , and almost all the references will be to these .    that understood",
    ", i shall begin with a few observations on the excess of events at high @xmath2 and @xmath1 reported by h1 and zeus , which lead into an update on perturbative qcd in dis and beyond @xcite .",
    "i will then turn to a review of generalizations of the factorization formalism that underlies perturbative qcd @xcite , from unpolarized to polarized scattering @xcite and to diffraction @xcite .",
    "i ll also say a few words about openings to nonperturbative qcd .",
    "finally , i will conclude with some thoughts on where we are now , and where the field is going .",
    "the dis cross sections @xmath3 for @xmath4 scattering is conventionally presented in terms of the structure functions @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 , & = & 2 ^ 2 sq^4 , [ ftwotosigma ] where as usual @xmath8 is the scaling variable with @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the fractional leptonic energy loss in the proton rest frame .",
    "surely the most widely - recognized result from hera this year is the excess of events found at high @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( equivalently , high @xmath11 and @xmath1 ) , compared to the  standard model \" , based on nlo qcd in dis , as seen by zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite . because the speculation engendered by these reports goes far beyond the qcd that goes into them",
    ", i will discuss their possible interpretation separately in this section , and only then return to qcd , and the standard model with which they have been compared .",
    "it s an unexpected pleasure to comment on the large-@xmath2 excess , although it is hardly possible to review the theoretical studies that have sprouted like so many flowers after a spring rain @xcite .",
    "surely it is ,  about time \" , for a new phenomenon , as it was so aptly observed .",
    "we shall have to wait and see , however , whether the time has truly come .",
    "the events themselves are beautiful examples of the capabilities of the hera detectors ( fig .",
    "[ qevents ] ) , and of the imprint on hadronic final states of momentum transfers at short distances .",
    "the excess of events over the presently - available  standard model \" is shown in terms of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ excess ] .",
    "8.0 true in    3.0 true in    the most popular interpretations described at the workshop rely either on a  conservative \" approach , of descriptions by contact terms @xcite , or on more ambitious models with new particles , leptoquarks , possessing both baryon and lepton quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the most promising of these models are based on supersymmetry , albeit in a somewhat variant form @xcite .",
    "contact terms are contributions to an effective lagrangian , which describes the feed - down of very massive degrees of freedom to the standard model , _ contact = _ _ ij _ ij^2_i_e_i_j^q_j , [ contact ] with @xmath12 and @xmath13 referring to left- and right - helicities .",
    "these new terms are in direct analogy to the low - energy four - fermion description of the weak interactions .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 are new scales , most likely associated with heavy particle masses , typically in the tev range .",
    "generally , contact terms are not consistent with a  bump \" in the mass distribution of the events , as marginally suggested by some of the h1 ( but not zeus ) presentations of the data .    in leptoquark descriptions ,",
    "the events are due to one ( or more ) new states in the actual mass range of the events themselves , typically just above 200 gev .",
    "vector leptoquarks have larger cross sections than scalar , and can be excluded by results from the tevatron @xcite . even for scalar leptoquarks ,",
    "tevatron bounds are strong .",
    "susy models are favored on this basis , because they result in suppressed branching ratios for the more readily observable leptonic decays .",
    "since the new particles are evidently produced singly rather than as particle - antiparticle pairs , candidate susy models can not have the symmetry (  r - parity \" ) built into many susy models precisely to forbid such single - superparticle production and decay mechanisms , and related ( but avoidable ) problems with proton decay @xcite . in any case , the relevant terms in the lagrangian are of the general form _",
    "susy=_ijk_ijkl_iq_jd_k , [ susy ] which couples leptons ( through the corresponding  superfield \" ) @xmath15 , quarks through @xmath16 and the new superpartner , scalar leptoquarks , through @xmath17 .",
    "their coupling strengths are measured by the constants @xmath18 , which must be determined from experiment .",
    "bounds from various other experiments , including @xmath19 runs at hera , limit the likely terms in eq .",
    "( [ susy ] ) to one coupling @xmath20 with the @xmath21 quark and a new scalar  squark \" @xmath22 , a superpartner of the charm quark @xcite .",
    "the impression left by the workshop is that the most common explanations of this excess _",
    "barely _ escape many bounds derived from a wide class of other experiments .",
    "these events seem to have been born into a hostile world .",
    "some bounds are from explicit searches in related experiments , most notably the tevatron @xcite , where lower limits on masses at the 95% confidence level fall just short of the excess , in the 150 - 200 gev@xmath23 range for scalar leptoquarks , and seem to rule out vector leptoquarks altogether in this mass range .",
    "the tevatron and lepii @xcite put lower limits on  contact terms \"  signals of the exchanges of very heavy particles  in the few tev range , which promise to grow larger . at the same time ,",
    "very different , low energy precision experiments are equally , perhaps even more , restrictive",
    ". of particular interest are the atomic parity - violation experiments , which , by a special serendipity , published new benchmarks of sensitivity within the few weeks prior to the conference @xcite . also striking are limits from searches for rare @xmath24 decays and double beta decays @xcite .",
    "depending on the scenario chosen to account for the excess , these already - existing experiments closely circumscribe the range of parameters .",
    "this may be a good sign or bad , depending on what happens .",
    "what is exciting is that something must happen .",
    "h1 and zeus have already begun an anticipated doubling of statistics by the year s end .",
    "workers at the tevatron advise us to ",
    "stay tuned \" .",
    "if one of the favored explanations is correct , it is probable that signals will show up elsewhere soon , perhaps in events with pairs of high-@xmath25 leptons and jets at the tevatron , perhaps in rare @xmath24 decays , perhaps in both .",
    "other , more and less conventional , explanations were also discussed , including a possible relation to the much debated high-@xmath25 excess seen by cdf but ( probably ) not by d0 .",
    "such a connection is possible , although it might be expected to be larger , not smaller , in hadronic collisions @xcite .",
    "considered in isolation , it seems just possible that the excess is  simply \" the sign of standard parton distributions that are a bit larger at @xmath26 than in the present global fits @xcite .",
    "exotic color states were also suggested @xcite .",
    "the adequacy of the  standard \" calculation for the high-@xmath1 region might be reexamined as well .",
    "one thing to keep in mind is that any increase in the qcd prediction would chip away at what is still a relatively small statistical discrepancy between theory and experiment , and would make a ( perhaps disappointing ) explanation in terms of a fluctuation more probable .",
    "certainly , we were left with much to think over .",
    "now it s time to return to qcd , the primary theme of the conference .",
    "i will begin with a brief review of the theory that underlies the experiments described here , and then discuss results on the fundamental objects in perturbative qcd , structure functions and jet cross sections , along with parton distributions and the  bfkl \" program .",
    "most of the essential features of this wide range of topics must , of course , be found in the individual contributions to the workshop .",
    "the characteristic property of qcd is its asymptotic freedom , according to which the coupling @xmath27 becomes weaker as it is probed at shorter distances @xmath28 .",
    "this extraordinary feature is exploited by identifying infrared ( ir ) safe quantities , cross sections ( or other observables ) which can be expanded as power series in @xmath29 in terms of coefficients that are ir finite , and more generally independent of the light mass scales of the theory : @xmath30 and the light quark and ( vanishing ) gluon masses .",
    "if an ir safe cross section depends on large scale @xmath31 and dimensionless kinematic variables @xmath1 , it takes the schematic form q^2(q^2,x)=_n0c_n(q^2/^2,x ) _",
    "s^n(^2 ) , [ irs ] where the @xmath32 are finite functions , or more often integrable distributions in the variable @xmath1 .",
    "classic examples of ir safe quantities are the total cross section for lepton pair annihilation to hadrons , and various jet and event shape cross sections in the same process .",
    "the power of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) for large classes of inclusive processes comes from its factorization and evolution properties .",
    "factorization is expressed for unpolarized dis of lepton @xmath33 on hadron @xmath34 as q^2_h(q , p ,",
    "m ) & = & _ partons _ i _ _ x^1 d _ i ( q^2pq , q^2 ^ 2,_s(^2 ) ) + &  & f_i / h(,,m ) , [ disfact ] where @xmath35 is the momentum transfer , @xmath9 , @xmath36 represents the light scales of the theory ( including the target mass @xmath37 ) , and the sum is over parton type @xmath38 .",
    "the separation of the ir - safe partonic cross section @xmath39 from the nonperturbative , but universal , parton distribution @xmath40 requires a factorization scale , @xmath41 , usually identified with the renormalization scale at which the coupling is evaluated .",
    "the physical cross section , of course , is independent of @xmath41 .",
    "corrections to ( [ disfact ] ) are _ power suppressed _ , by at least @xmath42 , so that when @xmath41 is chosen to be of order @xmath31 , factorization in terms of parton distributions is a very good approximation at large momentum transfer . on the other hand , as @xmath2 decreases below the proton mass , we may expect  higher - twist \" power corrections to come into play .",
    "each of the dis structure functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 satisfies a factorized form like eq .",
    "( [ disfact ] ) .",
    "the convolution in parton fractional momentum @xmath45 is conveniently denoted as , for instance , f_2 = c_2f , [ otimesfact ] with @xmath46 an ir safe  coefficient function \" , analogous to @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ disfact ] ) . our freedom to choose @xmath41 in the factorized dis cross section , = 0 , [ dsigzero ] readily leads to the dglap evolution equations @xcite , by separation of variables , & = & -p(_s ) , + & = & p(_s)f , [ dglap ] where the @xmath48 s are the familiar evolution kernels of qcd .",
    "they are perturbatively calculable precisely because @xmath49 is . like the factorization formula ,",
    "the evolution equations are valid up to corrections suppressed by @xmath42 .    written out in terms of dglap kernels @xmath50 , the evolution equations are @xmath51 for singlet distributions , and ^2 ^ 2 q_ns = _",
    "s(^2 ) 2 p_qq q_ns [ nsevol ] for nonsinglet .",
    "these , along with a set of boundary conditions , are used to predict parton distributions and structure functions for previously unmeasured values of @xmath2 .",
    "( we should note that dglap evolution alone does not allow us to  evolve \" in @xmath1 ; more on this below . )",
    "a result of this past year deeply rooted in dglap evolution is the high - statistics determination of @xmath29 , reported by ccfr through analysis of the evolution of @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite , using the proportionality of the logarithmic derivative with respect to @xmath2 of these structure functions to @xmath54 . with this result ,",
    "@xmath55 , measurements of the strong coupling from relatively low - energy dis experiments have come ( predominantly , if not completely @xcite ) into agreement with values found from @xmath0 annihilation at the z mass .",
    "this has put to rest some of the speculation based on discrepancies between the two ranges of energy .",
    "not all dis estimates give such a high value , however , although scaling violation in @xmath53 appears to be the most precise .",
    "zeus and h1 presented data , and new analyses of data , from 1994 through 1996 , mapping out the behavior of @xmath52 over an increasing range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with shrinking errors @xcite .",
    "the primary emphasis was on the very high-@xmath2 and very low-@xmath2 results .",
    "these were complemented by the final nmc results for deuterium , at large @xmath1 and moderate @xmath31 @xcite , and those from ccfr @xcite .",
    "the high-@xmath2 analysis at hera became possible as the integrated luminosity passed 20 pb@xmath56 by the end of 1996 .",
    "we have already discussed the observed excess of events in that region . a feeling for the nature of the dglap - based evolution of the neutral current cross section to large @xmath2 is given by fig .",
    "[ sigtild ] , which plots the cross section of eq .",
    "( [ ftwotosigma ] ) scaled by the coefficient of @xmath52 . on the basis of analyses such as these , h1 and zeus have estimated uncertainties in the nlo predictions at high @xmath2 of order ten percent @xcite .",
    "new low @xmath1 and @xmath2 results from hera were made possible by runs with detector modifications and/or shifts in the event vertex , which extend coverage of the existing detectors to more forward regions @xcite .",
    "[ xfixed ] and [ qfixed ] show , respectively , trends of the data with @xmath31 for representative values of @xmath1 and vice - versa .    as fig .",
    "[ xfixed ] shows , charm production plays a large role in the total cross section for small @xmath1 even for relatively small @xmath2 , comparable to the charm mass @xcite .",
    "this is understandable ; the relevant variable is now @xmath57 at small @xmath1 , and we can be far above the charm threshold even for @xmath58 , if @xmath1 is small enough . indeed , charm production is an important effect even for photoproduction , where @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the special interest of low @xmath31 comes in part from the very success of dglap evolution in describing @xmath52 to surprisingly low values of @xmath2 , even below 1 gev@xmath23 .",
    "the grv parton distributions @xcite are based on  valence - like \" boundary conditions in this range , and give a reasonable description of @xmath52 there .",
    "below @xmath60 gev@xmath23 , deviations begin to show up , in which the cross section grows less rapidly toward small @xmath1 , corresponding to a slow - down of evolution compared to perturbative predictions .",
    "the picture here remains a bit cloudy , with various explanations , fits @xcite and models offered , often inspired by pre - qcd phenomenology , such as vector meson dominance @xcite and regge theory @xcite , alongside efforts at quantitative prediction based on the perturbative bfkl formalism @xcite , which itself has one foot in qcd perturbation theory and one in regge theory .",
    "the transition region between perturbative and nonperturbative degrees of freedom is not wide , at least as measured in gev , but no single model can yet bridge it . we must hope for theoretical developments in this direction , a question to which we shall return .    in terms of pqcd itself , we can identify two generic corrections for low @xmath1 and @xmath31 not included in the dglap equation at nlo , which warn us of the transition region .",
    "these are : logarithms of @xmath1 at higher orders in the splitting kernel , and power corrections that are order @xmath28 with @xmath61 the factorization scale .",
    "it is important to emphasize that these corrections are different . in particular , the former are consistent with leading twist factorization , the latter require ( at the least ) generalized factorizations . the bfkl equation deals with logarithms of @xmath1 at leading power .",
    "let s review how it arises in dis .",
    "the well - known bfkl equation @xcite , applied to dis , summarizes leading logarithms in @xmath1 .",
    "let me reemphasize that the bfkl equation is fully consistent with dglap evolution , and constitutes a reorganization of information in the dglap kernels @xmath48 .",
    "like the dglap equation , it may be derived from a factorization of dis structure functions , but now one that is accurate only to the level @xmath62 , f(x , q^2)&= & _ x^1 d c(x , q^2 ^ 2 ) g(,q^2)+o(1/q^2 ) + & = & d^2k_t c(x,q , k_t)(,k_t)+o(1/(1/x ) ) .",
    "[ bfklfact ] in the second form , the wave function @xmath63 is in a @xmath64 convolution with the coefficient function , while the fractional momentum @xmath65 plays the role of a factorization scale .",
    "the relation of @xmath63 to the gluon distribution @xmath66 is g(,q^2)=^qd^2k_t ( , k_t ) .",
    "[ gpsi ] just as the first factorization form leads to dglap evolution by invoking the independence of @xmath67 on @xmath41 , so the independence of @xmath67 on @xmath65 leads to another evolution equation , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ dglap ] ) , but now with a convolution in transverse momentum rather than @xmath65 .",
    "this is the bfkl equation @xcite , = d^2k_t(k_t - k_t)(,k_t ) .",
    "[ bfkl ] the kernel @xmath68 turns out to be independent of @xmath69 in this approximation , although by dimensional analysis it could have depended upon it .",
    "further insight into the significance of the bfkl equation can be found in the very general  wilsonian \" treatment @xcite of the underlying factorization , by separating the dynamics into independent hamiltonians , appropriate to the opposite - moving external particles .",
    "i think we can anticipate progress in interpreting other factorizations from this approach in the coming years .",
    "solutions to the bfkl equation may be found by substituting trial solutions in the form of powers of @xmath69 and @xmath64 .",
    "these solutions take a continuous range of powers of @xmath69 , of which the most singular is the famous bfkl result , ( , k_t)~^-4n2(_s/ ) .",
    "[ bfklpom ] the scale , and therefore the size , of @xmath29 is undetermined in this leading logarithm formalism .",
    "in addition , the full description of near - forward scattering at next - to - leading logarithm in @xmath1 requires three - gluon exchange contributions , which are not included in the bfkl equation at all .",
    "these cautions aside , a provocative treatment of nonleading logarithms in solutions to the bfkl equations based on analogy to dglap evolution was presented @xcite .    from the dglap point of view , the bfkl equation sums up those contributions to the gluon - gluon splitting function that are leading at each order in @xmath29 , of the form @xmath70/x$ ] .",
    "it is by now an old story , however , that the growth in @xmath52 at low @xmath1 should not be interpreted as a direct observation of unadorned bfkl dynamics .",
    "nlo dglap evolution seems quite up to the task , and the higher orders seem not to be needed .    in any case , the solution eq .",
    "( [ bfklpom ] ) can not strictly speaking be exact , because it predicts a gluon distribution that increases as a power of @xmath1 , and therefore a total cross section that increases as a power of @xmath71 , which would eventually violate unitarity bounds .",
    "one way of understanding this behavior is that power - like solutions do not build in momentum conservation , which is only enforced at the level of nonleading logarithms .    at the same time , when @xmath1 is small enough that @xmath72 , nonleading logarithms must be taken into account , and have the effect of moderating the growth of @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "this general picture is consistent with what we have seen above , in fig .",
    "[ qfixed ] , for instance , but there is no assurance that by the time resumed bfkl logarithms become important for structure functions , a perturbative treatment is appropriate at all .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to construct models for @xmath75 , based on the evolution equations we have encountered above , and to derive in this way a fairly good picture of low-@xmath1 and @xmath2 evolution @xcite .",
    "the search for bfkl phenomenology , that is , for experiments whose interpretation requires the resummation of logarithms of @xmath74 , has by and large shifted from the structure functions to less inclusive measurements , following general lines introduced by mueller and navelet @xcite in hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "the method is to identify events that can be  tagged \" by jets at wide rapidity separations .",
    "if the transverse momentum of the jets is substantial , there is little chance of a higher-@xmath76 jet in between , and dglap evolution should be unimportant .",
    "at the same time , if the partonic fractions of the two jets are very different , perturbative bfkl dynamics ought to dominate . at _",
    "very _ high energy , the solution ( [ bfklpom ] ) would describe such cross sections , with @xmath77 replaced by the rapidity difference between the two jets .",
    "energy conservation , however , makes it impossible to have enough gluons emitted between the tagged jets to reproduce the exponential of the rapidity , and more sophisticated numerical approaches appear to be necessary . among these",
    "are very new bfkl ",
    "monte carlo \" generators @xcite .",
    "the general features of bfkl evolution have been built into the event generator ariadne , at a somewhat less formal level .",
    "studies searching for such bfkl effects have been carried out at the tevatron @xcite in terms of angular correlations between the tagged jets , without showing specifically bfkl behavior . at the same time , studies of dijet cross sections by zeus @xcite at large rapidity separations are more encouraging , at least when ariadne is compared to nlo calculations @xcite . a corresponding example from h1 is shown in fig  [ dijetdis ] .",
    "the difference between the two reports may be more apparent than real , however , since the  theory \" used in each case is different .",
    "finally , progress has been reported in the extension of the bfkl equation .",
    "the program of fadin and lipatov toward the calculation of the two - loop kernel for the bfkl equation , appears to be at the threshold of completion @xcite .",
    "the capstone of this enterprise , the  two - reggion - two - gluon vertex \" , has been presented at this workshop for the first time . the expression remains at this time a bit unwieldy to speculate on its quantitative consequences , although expected signs of the running of the coupling are possible to pick out .",
    "alternative technical approaches , based on helicity methods are also being pursued @xcite .      to incorporate the extra information on evolution of dis structure functions contained in the bfkl equation , while still keeping logarithms of @xmath31 ,",
    "it is useful to _ demand _ an evolution that is independent of changes of factorization scheme , up to unincorporated corrections in @xmath78 as well as @xmath79 .",
    "the latter are taken care of by dglap evolution .",
    "the former may be incorporated by studying the evolution of the structure functions themselves @xcite . combining factorization f_2^ns(q)=c(_s(q^2 ) ) q_ns(q ) [ nsfact ] with the nonsinglet evolution equation ( [ nsevol ] ) , we readily derive an evolution equation for the nonsinglet structure function itself , f^ns(q ) = ( cq^2 + cp_qqc^-1 ) f^ns(q ) _",
    "nsf^ns , [ nsfevol ] in which @xmath80 includes the evolution dependence of the coefficient function through the running coupling .",
    "the extension to singlet structure functions follows the same pattern .",
    "this formulation makes possible a  consistent \" ,  scheme - independent \" treatment of logarithms of @xmath1 , through the incorporation of coefficient functions , along with evolution in @xmath2 . as evolution proceeds ,",
    "the input level of accuracy in @xmath81 and @xmath82 are retained , by avoiding scheme - dependent complications which can arise from separating the coefficient functions from the parton distributions .",
    "this makes possible surprising improvements in the fit to the low-@xmath1 hera data @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the same general approach can be used a very high @xmath1 , to take into account logarithms of @xmath83 not included in nlo @xcite . in this case",
    ", the nonsinglet evolution equation alone is adequate , as logarithms of @xmath83 do not involve flavor mixing .",
    "the equation that takes into account these corrections is exactly eq .",

    "an analysis directly in terms of structure functions , however useful for inclusive dis , is limited to that process . to treat jet cross sections , or heavy quark production in dis and other processes",
    ", we need to retreat from the ascetic evolution in terms of observables only , to parton distribution functions .",

    "f_j / h _ ij , where @xmath47 is an irs distribution , calculable in pqcd .",
    "the gluon distribution can be determined by fitting @xmath52 at nlo @xcite , and is also accessible at leading order in jet , heavy quark and direct photon cross sections @xcite .",
    "an example of the former is shown in fig .",
    "[ gluondist ] from @xcite , which exhibits a good agreement with results of the global fitting programs of mrs @xcite and cteq @xcite .",
    "the more exclusive determinations , such as those based on direct photons , are appealing because the gluon distribution enters them at leading order . at the same time , higher - order corrections are generally more difficult to control in these cases , and sometimes effects that are formally nonleading twist , such as  intrinsic \" parton momenta , are important @xcite .",
    "indeed intrinsic transverse momenta of order 1gev seem necessary to explain the comparison of nlo theory with experiment for direct photon production measured by the fixed target experiment e706 , as illustrated by fig .",

    "a diffractive dis process is of the general form @xmath126 , for hadronic final state @xmath127 where @xmath128 is small .",
    "since the proton is present in both the initial and final states , the production of @xmath127 involves no transfer of quantum numbers .",

    "the twist , and therefore @xmath31-dependence of the process depends on the polarizations of these exchanges .",
    "when both gluons carry physical polarizations , the process is higher - twist , but includes a color - singlet component , and can describe exclusive vector boson production , as above .",
    "when one of the gluons carries an unphysical polarization , the process can be leading twist , and is suitable for describing inclusive diffraction .",
    "the interplay of polarization and color exchange is particularly well illustrated in recent work described at the workshop on  semiclassical \" models , in which , as in the dipole model , the pair is pictured as interacting with a background classical color field while passing though the target proton @xcite . the simplification of the coupling of the semiclassical background field to the color dipole bears a close relation to the factorization of soft gluons from jets in perturbative proofs of factorization theorems @xcite .",
    "one of the virtues of the color dipole model is that it allows the investigation of higher- and leading - twist effects within a single framework .",
    "such an analysis @xcite suggests that as @xmath155 , higher twist may dominate for a wide range of @xmath31 .",
    "if so , the apparent peak near @xmath156 of @xmath148 , referred to above , may be the result of a restriction to a leading twist fit .",
    "the interplay between short- and long - distance interactions is well - illustrated by the rapidity gaps in jet production observed at the tevatron . unlike the diffractive events discussed above , partons from both the beams appear to undergo hard scatterings , producing pairs of jets . in a detectable fraction of events ,",
    "however , there is little or no radiation in the rapidity range between the jets @xcite .",
    "this is normally attributed to the exchange of strongly interacting partons in a color singlet configuration , a  hard pomeron \" , which complements the high-@xmath2 diffractive vector boson production discussed above .",
    "these events are more difficult to study , however , because their large momentum transfers make them rare , and because they are masked by unconnected  spectator - spectator \" interactions which reduce their  survival \" in the final state .",
    "we may hope , however , for progress in the theory of rapidity gap events , as more is learned about the role of color exchange in hard cross sections @xcite .",
    "as we have noted above , perturbative qcd predictions at nlo are most accurate when the cross section is sensitive to only a single large scale .",
    "jet cross sections and event shapes , although ir safe , remain sensitive to hadronization scales even at quite high energies , as at lep @xcite .",
    "event generators have been remarkably successful in modeling such cross sections , but they are bound to mask some of the physics in adjustable parameters .",
    "one of the important developments of the past year has been a new willingness to step back from event generators and to confront perturbative computations directly to the data . in jet cross sections ,",
    "the discrepancy between nlo ( or nnlo ) theory and experiment is rather large , of the order of tens of percent , but shows a characteristic power decay , as @xmath157 or @xmath158 , depending on the quantity tested .",
    "dis experiments are ideal for the study of such effects , since @xmath31 can be varied in a single experiment .",
    "the impetus for this reanalysis has come from theory @xcite .",
    "the basic observation is that when we calculate an ir safe cross section , we do not eliminate contributions from soft partons altogether .",
    "rather , they typically occur in integrals of the generic form ,",
    "_ 0^q d^a+2bk1(k^2)^b .",

    "normally , such corrections are simply absorbed into the ir safe coefficients of the strong coupling .",
    "on the other hand , we really do not know how soft gluons contribute , and we certainly expect that for @xmath164 , nonperturbative scales will become important .    for many irs quantities , it is possible to reorganize ( resum ) perturbation theory into a form in which the running coupling itself signals the introduction of nonperturbative scales .",
    "consider , for example , the thrust @xmath165 , defined in dis as t_c = max _ , where the sum is over all hadrons in the breit - frame hemisphere of the scattered quark , and the maximum is over unit directions .",
    "@xmath165 , which is frame dependent , is maximized to unity when all the hadrons line up in a single jet . at lowest order in perturbation theory ,",
    "the final state is a quark pair , and @xmath166 exactly .",
    "we thus naturally consider @xmath167 , 1-t_c = 1q _ i (    single soft gluon emitted by the quark is given approximately by ^(1)_1-t_c= c_f_s(k_t ) _",
    "k_t^q dk_0 k_0-q .",

    "this is that the study of quantum chromodynamics and the investigation of hadronic scattering are the most challenging problems in quantum field theory that are currently accessible in the laboratory .",
