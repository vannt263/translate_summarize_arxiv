    "when a relativistic charged particle crosses the interface between two media of different dielectric properties , transition radiation ( tr ) is emitted .",

    "we use their formula with virtual - quanta method to compute the backward tr from a finite screen@xcite @xmath5 ^ 2 \\label{eq : eq3}\\ ] ] where t is correction tern to finite size of the screen .",
    "this gives the single electron yield ( sey ) . from the sey",
    "the whole spectrum can be derived using the following formula : @xmath6 \\label{eq : eq1}\\ ] ] where n is the number of electrons in the bunch and @xmath7 is the form factor of the time profile of the bunch .",
    "using phase recovery methods , such as kramers - kronig or hilbert  @xcite , it is possible to recover the phase and then the time profile of the bunch .      the same formula , but with a different sey is used for calculation of the smith - purcell radiation ( sp ) spectrum .",
    "sp radiation occurs when a charged particle move above a metallic periodic structure . unlike tr",
    ", sp has the advantage that the emitted radiation is not concentrated in a small observation angle ( @xmath8 ) , but spread in angle .",
    "the wavelength of the radiation for sp depends on the observing angle according to the following : @xmath9 where l is the grating period , n is the order of radiation , @xmath4 is the observation angle and @xmath3 is the relativistic velocity .    to calculate the sey and the total spectrum for sp effect ,",
    "the gfw code was used  @xcite .",
    "the calculation is based on the surface current model .",
    "taking into account the fact that the grating have a finite width , the energy per solid angle for a single electron can be written as : @xmath10 where z is the grating length , e is the electron charge and @xmath11 is the grating efficiency factor .",
    "calculation of the sey for sp and tr are presented on figure  [ sey ] .",
    "the screen used in this case for tr is a metalic disk with radius 20 mm and the grating for sp has a length of 180 mm and a width of 40 mm with a pitch of 8 mm and a 30 degrees blaze angle .",
    "the beam - grating distance ( from center of the beam to the top of the teeth ) is 3 mm .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath12 for both cases is 118 ( 60.3  mev ) .",
    "the other parameters were taken from the clio accelerator simulation in astra reported in  @xcite .     with 8 mm pitch and @xmath13 blaze angle .",
    "]    the sey spatial energy distribution for sp and tr are also significantly different .",

    "the calculation of coherent radiation was done with the same parameters than for the sey . for others grating",
    "this distribution would be different , but this gives us an approximate space distribution of the cspr . from these simulations",
    ", we can conclude that most of the radiation is confined in approximatively @xmath14 in azimuthal ( @xmath15 ) angle .",
    "so a standard 50  mm parabolic mirror at a distance of 300  mm from the grating will collect most of the radiation .    to choose the most appropriate grating pitch , one should use the condition given in equation  [ eq : lmab ] . for maximum emission at 90 deg .",
    "the formula [ eq : pitch_pulselength ] is applicable .",
    "@xmath16 where l is grating pitch in meters and @xmath17 is the bunch fwhm in seconds .    the relation between the the grating pitch , the pulse length and the angle of maximum emission is given on figure  [ mae ] .",
    "we can see that the green band ( @xmath18 emission ) follows the rule given in equation  [ eq : pitch_pulselength ] .",
    "we can also look at the total energy emitted by the grating as a function of the pulse length and the grating energy .",
    "this is shown on figure  [ epp ] . on this figure",
    "the transition between the coherent and incoherent regime can clearly be seen .     with @xmath13 blaze angle .",
    "the beam - grating separation is 3  mm . ]     with @xmath13 blaze angle . ]    in the case of cspr as the pulse length change the angular distribution of the energy will also change .",
    "this is shown on figure  [ f14 ] .",

    "]    using the bunch profile predicted for the clio free electron laser  @xcite , as shown on figure  [ prof1 ] we can predict the spectrum for both cspr and ctr as shown on figure  [ spctr ] .",
    "we can see that the intensity of the ctr signal is lower , but it is concentrated in a small solid angle . for cspr",
