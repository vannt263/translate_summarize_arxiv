    "here , we theoretically consider the thermal relaxation of electrons in a metallic grating and the consequences on the transient optical response of the grating .",
    "the relaxation of photoexcited electrons in metals occurs in several stages .",
    "commonly , the fastest stage implies thermalization of electrons resulting in a quasi - equilibrium electron distribution with the electron temperature exceeding that of the crystal lattice . this relaxation is due to efficient electron - electron scattering , and the corresponding times in metals are in the range of a few tens of fs ( for gold , this value is claimed to be about 30 fs ) .",
    "once thermalization is reached , the most universal process is cooling of electrons due to emission of phonons , i.e. transfer of the excess energy to the crystal lattice . for gold ,",
    "the characteristic time of this process , @xmath37 , is about 1 ps . for systems with a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of photoexcitation these processes are complemented by spatial electron energy transfer towards a balanced distribution .",
    "it has a quasi - ballistic character until electron thermalization is reached , switching to thermal diffusion afterwards .",
    "after the thermalization , the electron - lattice energy transfer can be described by the two - temperature model  @xcite , which describes the electron - lattice energy balance where thermal diffusion occurs mainly due to electrons possessing superior thermal conductivity in comparison to the lattice .",
    "the underlying equations for electron and lattice tempearture variation with time are : @xmath76 here @xmath77 are the electron and lattice heat capacity , @xmath39 is the electron heat conductivity , @xmath78 is the electron - phonon coupling factor , and @xmath79 describes the external power input into the electronic subsystem . the lattice thermal conductivity is neglected . the common approximation valid for @xmath80 exceeding the debye temperature is @xmath81 with the temperature - independent @xmath82 . in the linear - response regime , corresponding to small excitation fluence , we can neglect the temperature dependence of @xmath39 , @xmath77 .",
    "it is important that in infinite or semi - infinite structures the thermal diffusion is not described by a characteristic time corresponding to an exponential decay , but rather obeys a power - like law .",
    "the situation is essentially different for spatially confined structures .",
    "taking into account that the excitation of plasmonic structure takes place very fast , @xmath79 can be assumed to be a @xmath83-like function of time .",
    "the solution of eq.([eq:2 t ] ) can be written in terms of the initial electron temperature distribution @xmath84 .",
    "after simple algebra we obtain that this solution can be presented as a series @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the electron - phonon energy relaxation time , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are the eigenmodes of the helmholtz equation @xmath89 with the boundary condition of a zero gradient component of @xmath90 normal to the surface , corresponding to the boundary condition of a thermally isolated structure .",
    "this problem provides eigenvalues @xmath91 , each of which enter into the following two decay rates @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the characteristic thermal diffusion relaxation time of the @xmath27-th mode .",
    "the coefficients @xmath94 are determined by the following expression : @xmath95 where the @xmath96 are the coefficients in the expansion @xmath97 .    for metals usually @xmath98 .",
    "in this limit we obtain @xmath99 these expressions reflect the fact that due to the big difference of electron and lattice heat capacities hot electrons , at the first stage , lose their energy due to phonon emission and thermal diffusion reaching a quasi - equilibrium state with the lattice",
    ". this stage is characterized by the times @xmath100 .",
    "then , much slower relaxation occurs on the time scale @xmath101 , where both electron and lattice temperatures finally reach a uniform state .",
    "since we are interested in the analysis of the fast stage of relaxation , we disregard the contributions of the @xmath102-terms to the electron temperature evolution .",
    "let us provide explicit results for the thermal relaxation within a stripe of a plasmonic grating .",
    "we chose the coordinate system such that the stripe is within the region @xmath103 , @xmath104 . from the general expressions for @xmath105 we obtain @xmath106 where @xmath107 the coefficients",
    "@xmath31 are determined by @xmath105 : @xmath108 with @xmath109 for @xmath110 and @xmath111 otherwise .",
    "as we see the relaxation of nonequilibrium electrons has a multi - exponential character , with the exponents strongly dependent on the geometry of the structure ( in the particular case of a stripe , on the dimensions of its cross - section ) .",
    "for actual structures @xmath112 can be as small as a few hundreds of fs .",
    "the mechanism of the optical response to electron heating is based on perturbation of the metal dielectric permittivity by heating of the electrons  @xcite . in the linear response regime",
    "we can assume that this perturbation is proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "as a result , the perturbation of the dielectric perimittivity is given by @xmath114 where the derivative is calculated for ambient temperature .",
    "in general , it is a complex number , and we present it in the form @xmath115 . to calculate the perturbation of the optical transmission of the system , @xmath116",
    ", we introduce the coefficients @xmath34 , defined as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the perturbation of transmission induced by that of the dielectric permittivity @xmath119 . in the linear response regime",

    "<S> we demonstrate that in confined plasmonic metal structures subject to ultra - fast laser excitation electron thermal diffusion can provide relaxation faster than the energy transfer to the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this relaxation occurs due to excitation of nanometer - sized hot spots in the confined structure and the sensitivity of its optical parameters to the perturbation in these regions . </S>",
    "<S> both factors become essential when the plasmonic resonance condition is met for both excitation and detection . </S>",
    "<S> a pump - probe experiment on plasmonic gold lattices shows sub - picosecond relaxation with the characteristic times well - described by a two - temperature model . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that dynamical optical response in plasmonic structures can be tuned by selection of the structural geometry as well as the choice of wavelength and polarization of the excitation and detection light .    </S>",

    "<S> regard , elucidating and understanding the relaxation dynamics and heat dissipation in plasmonic elements after excitation by a femtosecond light pulse is essential  @xcite . in a homogeneous metal , hot electrons loose their energy by emission of phonons , following the ultrafast initial stage of photoexcited carrier thermalization by electron - electron scattering . at room temperature , in most metals phonon relaxation occurs on time scales of the order of a picosecond or less  @xcite . in nanopatterned plasmonic structures , </S>",
    "<S> however , the light absorption becomes strongly inhomogeneous in space and shows in particular hot spots . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the reflection and transmission coefficients depend strongly on the spatial distribution of temperature . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the optical response of the photoexcited structure is determined not only by electron cooling through phonon emission , but also by redistribution of energy in space via electron thermal diffusion ( etd ) .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that in plasmonic structures etd evolves on timescales comparable to or even shorter than phonon emission , modifying significantly the sub - ps cooling dynamics as manifested by the ultrafast optical response . </S>",
    "<S> nanoplasmonic metal structures are typically embedded in an environment with low thermal conductivity , so that during times shortly after the optical excitation they behave as thermally isolated systems with a correspondingly decelerated heat removal . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we show that in plasmonic structures which support optical excitation of nanometer - sized hot spots , etd becomes feasible on ultrafast sub - ps time scales and provides a decisive contribution to the electron relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that dedicated selection of material and geometry of a confined plasmonic structure allows tuning of its dynamical optical response by controlling the etd process parameters .    for the etd studies we used a model system of a plasmonic nanostructure : lateral gold gratings on top of a dielectric garnet layer , as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these structures can be considered as plasmonic crystals ( pcs ) which support surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) . </S>",
    "<S> the grating period is comparable to the wavelength of light in the visible / near - infrared spectral range which allows coupling of the far field radiation to the spps and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission spectra in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) show clear resonances which correspond to propagating spps at the metal - air and metal - dielectric interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the investigated pcs combine two prime features in a single structure : high tunability of the plasmonic resonances and heat confinement in each of the grating stripes . </S>",
    "<S> the tunability is achieved by variation of the incidence angle and proper choice of the polarization of the excitation light pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this enables one to generate different hot spot distributions within a stripe and to modify the etd flow . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal isolation is ensured by deposition of the pc on the dielectric substrate with low thermal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> most of the results presented below were obtained for a structure with stripe width @xmath0  nm , stripe height @xmath1  nm , and grating period @xmath2  nm . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , measurements were performed on structures with @xmath3  nm , @xmath4  nm , and @xmath5  nm , to study the scaling of the etd relaxation with the lateral pc size . </S>",

    "<S> the negative spike at zero delay is due to instantaneous non - linear response of the dielectric  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is followed by a rapid rise of the transmission with a time constant of about 50  fs which is attributed to the dynamical response of the imaginary part of the dielectric function due to the hot electron thermalization by electron - electron scattering right after the excitation pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent decay of the differential transmission during about a ps is due to electron - phonon relaxation , affecting mainly the real part of the dielectric function . </S>",

    "<S> we note that the transients scale linearly with pump excitation power ( up to 0.1  mj/@xmath17 ) which suggests that this behavior represents a linear response . in order to quantify the signal contributions we use the function @xmath18 to fit the decay with the first ( second ) term describing the slow ( fast ) component . </S>",

    "<S> the two - temperature model  @xcite used for analysis of the cooling dynamics and its manifestation in the pump - probe experiment are given in the appendix  [ a1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the electron temperature @xmath26 has a complex behavior which can be analyzed by decomposing the spatial distribution of @xmath26 into the eigenmodes of the thermal problem . </S>",
    "<S> each eigenmode is characterized by an individual relaxation time , resulting in general in a multi - exponential behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude weight of each eigenmode is determined by its contribution to the initial spatial distribution of @xmath26 , initiated by the pump pulse . </S>",
    "<S> for the rectangular pc stripe , these eigenmodes are the harmonic fourier components labeled by the indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the @xmath29- and @xmath30-directions ( see appendix [ a1 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> note that eq.([eq : perm ] ) reflects the main features of the relaxation process . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of relaxation times is determined by geometry and material of the structure and not directly related with its electromagnetic properties . on the other hand , optical access to a particular eigenmode depends on the possibility to couple the corresponding spatial profile of the perturbation to the laser radiation , both in excitation and detection . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling is determined by the plasmonic properties of the structure . </S>",
    "<S> it can be controlled by tuning wavelength , polarization and incidence angle of the laser . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the plasmonic resonance enhances the amplitudes of particular harmonics with @xmath41 such that they are comparable to the @xmath42 contribution . if the probe is also in the plasmonic resonance band , its sensitivity to the spatially - inhomogeneous pattern may be enhanced for particular harmonics with @xmath41 .    the double exponential decay in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 suggests that mostly two fourier components contribute to the thermal perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> let us provide some estimates in this respect . </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath43  wk@xmath44m@xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46  jk@xmath47m@xmath48 @xcite , from which we obtain @xmath49  ps , @xmath50  ps . </S>",
    "<S> obviously @xmath51 is very short and comparable to the electron scattering time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that a thermal conduction approach can hardly be applied to modeling of the electron energy transfer along the @xmath30-direction . </S>",
    "<S> as we are interested in the electron relaxation after the initial stage lasting a few tens of fs , we can analyze the subsequent dynamics using the etd approach solely for the @xmath29-direction considering the @xmath52 harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> another peculiarity of the pc is that even for finite incidence angle the pump excitation pattern is close to an even function of @xmath29 with respect to the center of the stripe . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the most important contributions arise from terms with even @xmath27 , corresponding to even harmonics . from calculations of the amplitudes @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the essential fourier components are those with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , both with @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in line with the double - exponential behaviour in fig .  2 , so that we can identify @xmath20 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> to obtain quantitative agreement with the measured values , we have to assume a somewhat reduced @xmath39 of about 250  wk@xmath44m@xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction may be caused by additional scattering of electrons at the surface and interfaces of the stripes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the pc with @xmath3  nm , theoretical and experimental values match for @xmath39 about 150  wk@xmath44m@xmath44 . the stronger reduction of @xmath39 in this case may be due to the smaller stripe thickness , enhancing the role of surface electron scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes @xmath19 deserve special attention . to that end , we show in figs .  [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) the spatial patterns of absorbed energy in a single stripe for plasmonic ( @xmath8-pol , top ) and non - plasmonic ( @xmath11-pol , bottom ) excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the bright areas indicate hot spot formation . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3](c ) the absorbed energy ( averaged over the @xmath30-direction ) is shown for different incidence angles @xmath6 demonstrating the absorption resonance for @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the hot spots contribute considerably to the modes with @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the excitation spatial profile can not be described by the combination of the uniform , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 harmonics ( the latter is shown in fig .  [ fig3](c ) by the dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the harmonics with @xmath64 , @xmath65 is very short . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the case of vertical relaxation , the corresponding harmonics probably relax in a non - diffusive way being unresolvable for pump - probe delays exceeding a few tens of fs . for non - plasmonic excitation ( shown for normal incidence only ) </S>",
    "<S> the absorption is much weaker . </S>",
    "<S> however , also here hot spots are formed at the sharp edges of the rectangular stripes , which can be well described by the @xmath53 and @xmath54 terms in the fourier series .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we have to consider how the local variation of the dielectric fucntion translates into changes of transmitted probe intensity </S>",
    "<S> . the calculated angle dependencies of the coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 are shown in fig.[fig3](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results explain the negative sign of the ratio @xmath23 observed for non - plasmonic excitation . indeed , the coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 have opposite signs for all considered angles . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 , being the average absorbed excitation energy , is per se positive . </S>",
    "<S> localization of the hot spots near the stripe edges for non - plasmonic pump ensures @xmath67 . for the plasmonic configuration </S>",
    "<S> , we do not achieve quantitative agreement of experiment and theory . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data suggest negative @xmath68 , which would occur for intense hot spots in the middle of the stripes . </S>",
    "<S> they do appear in the calculations due to the excitation of the plasmonic resonance ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) ) , but the calculated hot spots near the wall edges provide larger contributions for incidence angles of @xmath69 0 , 8 , and 17@xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath68 should be positive there as well . according to our calculations , the absorbed energy near the edges is strongly sensitive to the stripe shape . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we tentatively attribute the discrepancy of experiment and theory to deviation of the stripe shape from the assumed rectangular one .    </S>",
    "<S> the developed model allows us to estimate the role of etd also in plasmonic structures with a shape differing from a stripe and/or fabricated from a metal other than gold . </S>",
    "<S> etd becomes important if its characteristic relaxation rate @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the typical size of the hot - spot pattern in the plasmonic structure , is comparable to or exceeds @xmath73 . from setting the two rates </S>",
    "<S> equal , we can determine the required geometrical dimension of the plasmonic structure that needs to be undercut in order to reach these conditions , @xmath74 , which establishes a threshold for etd becoming efficient . in table </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : matdata ] we list the @xmath75 as well as the @xmath37 for various metals at 300  k. by tailoring material and geometry of the structure it is possible to obtain etd relaxation faster than that due to phonon emission . in this case also shape design is important to provide a strongly inhomogeneous optical excitation pattern .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to address the recent paper by harutyunyan et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in which optical excitation of hot spots in plasmonic nano - discs was attributed to the appearance of a short optical response in differential reflection transients . however , the relaxation time constant could not be measured due to insufficient time resolution . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the role of etd was not discussed as possible origin of the fast relaxation component .    .electron - phonon cooling time and @xmath75 for different metals . </S>",
    "<S> the material parameters are taken from @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in conclusion , we demonstrate that the relaxation in a photoexcited plasmonic grating can be enhanced by thermal diffusion of hot electrons on a sub - picosecond time scale , essentially below the value established for electron cooling by phonon emission . </S>",
    "<S> this fast relaxation is possible due to formation of nanometer - sized hot spots under ultra - fast optical excitation if the plasmonic resonance condition is met . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis based on the two - temperature model provides good agreement with the experimentally observed relaxation times and allows us to formulate a geometric criterion for the importance of thermal diffusion which can be adjusted through the plasmonic structure material and design . </S>"
