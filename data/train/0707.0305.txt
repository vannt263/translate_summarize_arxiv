    "these provided the astrometry used for lens models and defined a constant mass - to - light ( @xmath44 ) ratio model for the mass distribution in the lens models .",

    "we assume a lens galaxy stellar mass function @xmath51 with a dynamic range of a factor of 50 that approximates the galactic disk mass function of @xcite .",
    "for the typical lens we generated 4 magnification patterns for each image in each of the 10 lens models .",
    "we gave the magnification patterns an outer scale of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the einstein radius for the mean stellar mass @xmath54 .",
    "this outer dimension is large enough to fairly sample the magnification pattern while the pixel scale is small enough to resolve the accretion disk .",
    "we determined the properties of the accretion disk by modeling the observed light curves using the bayesian monte carlo method of @xcite ( also see * ? ? ? * ) . for a given disk model",
    "we randomly generate light curves , fit them to the observations and then use bayesian methods to compute probability distributions for the disk size averaged over the lens models , the likely velocities of the observer , lens , source , stars , and mass .",

    "we use black hole mass estimates for the quasars that are based on observed quasar emission line widths and the locally calibrated virial relations for black hole masses @xcite . for most systems we simply adopted the black hole mass estimates from @xcite based on the  ( @xmath56 ) ,  ( @xmath57 ) and h@xmath58  ( @xmath59 ) mass - linewidth relations . for sdss 1138 + 0314 , we measured the width of the ( 1549 ) line in optical spectra from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and estimated the black hole mass using the normalizations of @xcite .",

    "our results are shown in figures  [ fig : r2500 ] through  [ fig : rflux ] and summarized in table  [ tab : rs ] . for the comparison with theory and the figures",
    ", we corrected the measured sizes to @xmath72 assuming the @xmath73 scaling of thin disk theory and the mean inclination @xmath74 .",
    "there are two striking facts illustrated by the figures .",
    "first , we clearly see from fig .  [",
    "fig : r2500 ] that the microlensing sizes are well correlated with the black hole mass .",
    "a power - law fit between @xmath75 and @xmath66 yields : @xmath76 which is consistent with the predicted slope from thin disk theory ( @xmath3 ) and implies a typical eddington factor of @xmath77 if we fix the slope with mass to 2/3 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . @xcite estimate that the typical quasar has @xmath78 , which would indicate a radiative efficiency of @xmath79 .",
    "this efficiency is low compared to standard models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "second , we find that microlensing sizes are well correlated with sizes estimated from thin disk theory and from the observed flux ( figs .  [",
    "fig : r2500 ] and  [ fig : rflux ] ) , but the three size estimates show systematic offsets in scale . most of the offset between the microlensing disk size measurements and thin disk theory size estimates could be explained by the existing uncertainties , but the offset from the estimate based on the quasar flux is much more significant ( fig .  [",
    "fig : r2500 ] ) .",
    "while the microlensing and flux sizes are well - correlated , the measured disk sizes are @xmath80  dex larger than predicted from the observed flux .",
    "simply put , the quasars are not sufficiently luminous to be radiating as black bodies with a @xmath8 temperature profile . @xcite also noticed this problem in their more qualitative study of lensed quasars with x - ray observations .",
    "are the discrepancies between our measurements and the size estimated from the disk flux due to a problem in the measurements , an oversimplification of the disk model or a fundamental problem in the thin disk model ?",
    "we have tested our approach using monte carlo simulations of light curves and verified that we recover the input disk sizes .",
    "our results are also only weakly sensitive to the assumed prior on the microlens masses ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "we will overestimate the source size if a significant fraction of the observed flux comes not from the continuum emission of the disk but from the larger and minimally microlensed line emitting regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this includes not only the obvious broad lines but also the broad and balmer continuum emission that can represent @xmath81 of the apparent continuum flux at some wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we have experimented with adding a fraction of unmicrolensed light and found that 30% contamination does not lead to sufficiently large size changes to resolve the problem .",
    "the sizes shrink by approximately 20% .",
    "conservatively , black hole mass estimates from the virial technique have a scatter of a factor of @xmath6 @xcite , which contributes only 0.3 dex of scatter to the disk size estimates .",
    "the size estimates from the flux could be affected by misestimating the magnification or failing to correct for extinction in the lens galaxy , but the uncertainties in the magnifications are only a factor of @xmath82 at worst and none of these lenses shows significant extinction @xcite relative to the magnitude of the discrepancy .",
    "the problem is also not a consequence of the obvious flaws in our simplified disk model  the neglect of the inner edge and the different temperature profile of a relativistic disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for observations at a fixed wavelength , neglecting the inner edge does not have a dramatic effect on the effective source size and the effects of relativity on the temperature profile are modest .",
    "studies of the temperature profile in the disk with microlensing are best done by measuring the variation in source size with wavelength because size ratios can be measured much more accurately than absolute sizes . @xcite",
    "have used the wavelength dependence of the microlensing in he 1104 - 1805 to derive a slope @xmath83 or @xmath84 of @xmath85 that is consistent with thin disk theory but would also allow a shallower temperature profile that would reduce the differences between the microlensing and flux size estimates .",
    "the next step is clearly to use more sophisticated disk models including relativity and model atmospheres such as @xcite or @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that microlensing essentially measures the half - light radius ( @xmath86 for our model ) , so the first step should be to try to simultaneously match our size estimates and the observed fluxes assuming this to be the case , since the many additional parameters of the full disk models will make their direct inclusion in the microlensing calculations a major computational challenge .",
