    "the relative distribution of matter and light in the universe is an unresolved problem of fundamental importance in cosmology .",
    "direct observational data on galaxies give information on the distribution of light ; in contrast , most theoretical models simulate only the distribution of matter . that these two distributions may be different on galactic scales was evident since the discovery of dark halos around galaxies ( einasto , kaasik & saar 1974a , ostriker , peebles & yahil 1974 ) .",
    "several years later it became clear that differences between the distribution of light and matter exist on large scales as well .",
    "jeveer & einasto ( 1978 , hereafter je78 ) demonstrated that galaxies and clusters of galaxies are distributed in filaments , and the space between them is practically void of visible matter , whereas in numerical simulations of structure formation ( zeldovich 1978 ) low - density regions are not completely empty of matter .",
    "this difference between the distribution of galaxies and dark matter ( dm ) was quantified by zeldovich , einasto & shandarin ( 1982 ) : in numerical simulations there exists a population of almost isolated particles in voids which has no counterpart in the observed distribution of galaxies .",
    "einasto , jeveer & saar ( 1980 , hereafter ejs80 ) showed that this difference can be explained if the evolution of the universe is primarily due to gravity .",
    "as demonstrated by zeldovich ( 1970 , hereafter z70 ) , the gravitational instability enhances the density contrast : matter flows out from low - density regions toward high - density ones until it collapses to form galaxies and systems of galaxies .",
    "this process is slow and gravity is not able to evacuate voids completely ",
    "there must exist some primeval matter in voids .",
    "bahcall & soneira ( 1983 ) and klypin & kopylov ( 1983 ) demonstrated that the correlation function of clusters of galaxies has an amplitude larger than that of galaxies , and kaiser ( 1984 ) explained this using the theory of high peaks in a gaussian density field , introducing the term `` biasing '' to describe this fact .",
    "a similar relation holds for power spectra of clusters and galaxies ; and we define the bias parameter @xmath4 through the power spectra of all matter , @xmath5 , and that of the clustered matter , @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the wavenumber in units of @xmath9  mpc@xmath10 , and the hubble constant is expressed as @xmath11 km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 . according to this definition , the biasing parameter is a function of wavenumber @xmath8 .",
    "the power spectrum is calculated by integrating the density contrast over the whole space under study , thus the biasing parameter is a mean averaged over the space .",
    "as the bias factor of galaxies relative to matter was not known it was considered as a free parameter suitable to bring models of structure formation into agreement with observations of density fluctuations of galaxies . as an example we refer to the pioneering study of the standard cdm model by davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) . here a large biasing factor @xmath12 was applied to make the model agree with observations .",
    "actually the bias factor is a fundamental parameter characterizing the distribution of matter and galaxies , and must be determined from data .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the problem of how the presence of primordial matter in voids affects the power spectrum .",
    "the idea we shall use of how to estimate the bias factor of clustered matter relative to all matter was suggested by gramann and einasto ( 1992 , hereafter ge92 ) .",
    "they assumed that the structure evolution of the universe is primarily due to gravity .",
    "the primordial matter contracts and eventually forms galaxies only in case when its density is high enough , in other words , the formation of galaxies is essentially a threshold phenomenon ( ejs80 , einasto & saar 1986 ) .",
    "ge92 demonstrated that the power spectra of matter and clustered matter ( galaxies ) are similar in shape , and that the relative amplitude of the power spectrum of galaxies ( clustered population ) depends on the fraction of matter in the clustered population .",
    "we consider as `` clustered matter '' all matter associated with galaxies , including dark halos of galaxies , and clusters of galaxies .",
    "einasto et al .",
    "( 1994 , hereafter e94 ) studied the evacuation of voids and estimated the biasing parameter of clustered matter relative to all matter .    here",
    "we shall investigate the relation between the power spectra of clustered matter and all matter in more detail , and derive a new estimate of the respective bias factor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider the biasing as a physical phenomenon and compare our approach with other biasing studies .",
    "thereafter we investigate the influence of the void matter on the power spectra of galaxies and matter , using numerical simulations .",
    "one problem with numerical simulations is the identification of the present epoch .",
    "we do this in section 3 using the @xmath0 normalization . in section 4",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "section 5 gives main conclusions of the study .",
    "we shall assume here that the structure evolution of the universe is basically due to gravity , that initial density fluctuations are gaussian and adiabatic ( i.e. velocities of particles are in agreement with the density field ) .",
    "due to gravitational instability , the evolution of matter in under- and over - dense regions is different .",
    "gravity attracts matter toward high - density regions , thus particles flow away from low - density regions , and density in high - density regions increases until contracting objects collapse . as shown by z70 , the collapse occurs along caustics .",
    "initially it was assumed that caustics are two - dimensional pancake - like structures .",
    "however , direct observational data ( je78 , ejs80 , einasto , klypin & shandarin 1983 ) show that basic structural elements of the universe are strings and chains of galaxies and clusters .",
    "numerical simulations of structure evolution have confirmed the formation of essentially one - dimensional structures if the effective power index of the spectrum on galactic scales is negative ( melott et al .",
    "1983 , einasto et al .  1986 ,",
    "einasto & saar 1987 , gramann 1988 , melott & shandarin 1993 , pauls & melott 1995 , brodbeck et al .",
    "bond , kofman & pogosyan ( 1996 ) demonstrated analytically that under very general assumptions the gravitational evolution leads to a network ( web ) of high - density filaments and low - density regions outside of the web .",
    "general physical considerations suggest that in high - density regions the gas is cooling which creates favorable conditions for star formation ( rees & ostriker ( 1977 ) , silk ( 1977 ) ) .",
    "thus the gravitational character of the evolution leads to the formation of a filamentary web of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .    according to press & schechter ( 1974 )",
    ", the contraction occurs if the linear over - density exceeds a factor of 1.68 in a sphere of radius @xmath13 which determines the mass of the system or the galaxy . in a low - density environment",
    "the matter can not contract and remains primordial .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation by cen and ostriker ( 1992 , 1998 ) , katz , hernquist & weinberg ( 1992 ) , katz , weinberg & hernquist ( 1996 ) , weinberg , katz & hernquist ( 1997 ) have confirmed that the galaxy formation is ineffective in low - density environment .",
    "gas cooling , as required for star formation , occurs only in high - density regions  near the centers of contracting clumps of primordial matter .",
    "these considerations lead us to the conclusion , that within the gravitational instability picture the formation of galaxies is a density threshold phenomenon ( ejs80 , einasto & saar 1986 ) .",
    "the central problems are , how to find the threshold density which divides the primordial matter in low - density regions and the clustered matter in high - density regions , and how the division of matter into under - dense and over - dense populations influences the power spectra of galaxies and systems of galaxies .",
    "the true density field of the universe is a continuous function of coordinates since the dominating population is dark matter ( dm ) which consists of particles of small mass .",
    "here we accept the current paradigm that dm ( or at least , most of it ) is non - baryonic .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the universe can be simulated using n - body calculations . as the number of particles in simulations is limited , it is impossible to simulate the motion of all dm particles ; in practice the mass of particles in simulations is usually a fraction of the mass of a typical galaxy .",
    "thus , in order to find the true density field of dm , the distribution of a discrete set of particles is to be smoothed .",
    "galaxies also are discrete objects , the density field of galaxies can be calculated by smoothing , too . here",
    "the smoothing length is of prime importance .",
    "galaxies form mostly in small groups which are collected from primordial matter in a comoving volume of a megaparsec scale .",
    "thus , to start such a collapse of primordial matter , regions are needed with at least the mean matter density when smoothed on megaparsec scales .",
    "presently dm forms halos around galaxies in clusters and groups , and the characteristic scale of halos is the semi - minor radius of these systems , also @xmath14  @xmath15  mpc  ( einasto et al .  1984 ) . in the present paper",
    "our goal is to find _ the true density field of dm _ as accurately as possible .",
    "we conclude that the density field has to be found from positions of galaxies or simulation particles with a @xmath16  @xmath15  mpc  smoothing length .",
    "we call densities calculated with a small ( one mpc scale ) smoothing parameter as _ local _ ones , in contrast to _ global _ densities which are found using a large ( ten mpc scale ) smoothing length .",
    "our approach to the biasing phenomenon differs from the approach of most other investigators .",
    "commonly the biasing parameter is defined as the ratio of the density contrast of galaxies and matter at location @xmath17 , @xmath18 as there are no galaxies in voids , we expect @xmath19 there .",
    "if galaxies trace the matter in high - density regions , then in these regions @xmath20 . in order to apply this formula and to find a mean value of the biasing parameter , the density field is conventionally smoothed with a rather large smoothing length ( @xmath21  @xmath15  mpc , see dekel & lahav ( 1998 ) ) , blanton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and references therein for recent studies ) .",
    "excessive smoothing mixes unclustered dm in voids and clustered dm in high - density regions which makes the simple biasing phenomenon rather complicated .    our experience with density smoothing has shown that large smoothing is useful if one wants to locate large high - density regions , such as superclusters of galaxies , see figure  1b of lindner et al .  ( 1995 ) and figure  2 of frisch et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in this case",
    "the true filamentary nature of galaxy systems is completely lost , and we can only see the distribution of large over- and under - dense regions .",
    "visualizations of high - resolution simulations of structure evolution show that high - density regions of gas and dark matter form an almost coinciding and very thin filamentary web ( for a recent study see brodbeck et al .",
    "1998 ) , confirming older results obtained with lower resolution . thus",
    ", if we are interested in the true density field of dark matter we have to use a small smoothing length .",
    "the population of clustered particles is obtained from the population of all particles by exclusion of void particles .",
    "now we shall analyze how the exclusion of void particles influences the power spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum is defined through the density contrast @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the density at location @xmath17 , and @xmath24 is the mean density .    consider an idealized density field , which consists of a fluctuating clustered component and a background of constant density , so that @xmath25 here subscripts @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are for all matter , and its clustered and smooth components , respectively .",
    "the density contrast of the matter is @xmath29 or , applying ( 4 ) , @xmath30 since @xmath31 , @xmath32 in the last equation @xmath33 is the fraction of matter in the clustered population , @xmath34 ; and we get @xmath35    a similar formula holds for the density contrast in fourier space , and we obtain the relation between power spectra of matter and the clustered population @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fourier component of the matter density contrast for a wavenumber @xmath8 ; and the averaging is over the whole space under study .",
    "we see that for this ideal case the power spectra of matter and that the clustered population are related by an equation similar to ( 1 ) .",
    "hence we get for the bias factor @xmath38    equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) were derived by ge92 .",
    "these equations show that the subtraction of a homogeneous population from the whole matter population increases the amplitude of the spectrum of the remaining clustered population . in this approximation",
    "biasing is linear and does not depend on scale .",
    "these equations have a simple interpretation .",
    "the power spectrum describes the square of the amplitude of the density contrast , i.e. the amplitude of density perturbations with respect to the mean density .",
    "if we subtract from the density field a constant density background but otherwise preserve density fluctuations , then amplitudes of _ absolute _ density fluctuations remain the same , but amplitudes of _ relative _ fluctuations with respect to the mean density increase by a factor which is determined by the ratio of mean densities , i.e. by the fraction of matter in the new density field with respect to the previous one .",
    "the density of the real void population is not constant , neither is it appropriate to attribute part of the dark matter particles in high - density regions to the smooth background , i.e. to the void population , which does not penetrate high - density regions .",
    "thus we have to ask : how are power spectra of matter and the clustered population related for a more realistic distribution of matter ?      to answer this question we performed numerical simulations of the evolution of matter . as",
    "the above formulae are identical in the 2-d and 3-d cases we used a 2-d simulation to obtain a better resolution .",
    "we used a particle - mesh ( pm ) algorithm with @xmath39 particles and cells , and a double - power law initial power spectrum , ( eqn .",
    "( 3 ) in einasto et al .  ( 1999a ) , paper i )  a simple approximation of the observed spectra of galaxies and clusters of galaxies with a sharp maximum ( frisch et al .  1995 ) , as seen in figure  1 of paper i. the power index on large scales ( harrison - zeldovich region ) was taken to be @xmath40 , and @xmath41 on small scales ; in the 3-d case these indices correspond to @xmath42 and @xmath43 on large and small scales , respectively .",
    "the turnover at @xmath44 was @xmath45 , where @xmath46  @xmath15  mpc  is the box size .",
    "the corresponding linear scale is @xmath47  @xmath15  mpc .",
    "the present epoch was identified using an rms density dispersion of @xmath48 on a scale of 1  @xmath15  mpc , which corresponds approximately to a variance of @xmath49 on a scale of 8  @xmath15  mpc .",
    "we find the density field using a top - hat smoothing on 1  @xmath15  mpc  scale ( cell size ) , and , by linear interpolation in both coordinates , we attribute a density value to each particle .",
    "densities are expressed in units of the mean density .",
    "we assume that particles with different density labels can be used to represent void particles and galaxies ( with their halos ) of different morphological type and environment .",
    "we shall discuss this assumption and the relation between clustered particles and galaxies in more detail in the next subsection .",
    "in accordance with arguments discussed above we call all particles with low density values ( @xmath50 ) _ void particles _ ; all others are called _ clustered particles_. particles with high density values ( @xmath51 ) are associated with clusters or groups , and particles with intermediate density values ( @xmath52 ) with field galaxies . in the real universe field galaxies",
    "are located around clusters and form filaments between clusters and groups . here",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 are the threshold densities that divide void particles from clustered ones , and particles associated with clusters from particles bound to field galaxies .    of course , in the real universe the threshold between void and clustered particles is not sharp .",
    "if a clump of primordial matter is small enough , then it can contract and form a dwarf galaxy , even if the density , smoothed on 1 @xmath15  mpc  level , is smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , if a clump is large , it can remain in primordial form if the density , smoothed on 1 @xmath15  mpc  level , is greater than @xmath55 .",
    "such local irregularities make the threshold fuzzy .",
    "what matters is the mean value of the threshold .",
    "we investigate the influence of the fuzziness of the threshold density to the power spectrum of galaxies below .",
    "[ figure1 ]      in order to apply results of numerical simulations to samples of real galaxies we must find the relationship between the distribution of real and simulated galaxies ( i.e. particles in the clustered population ) .    based on considerations by ejs80 on the different evolution of under- and over - dense regions ,",
    "einasto & saar ( 1986 ) divided particles in simulations into void and clustered populations using the mean density as the threshold density . in this case",
    "the topologies of simulated and real galaxy samples are in very good agreement ( einasto et al .",
    "a similar agreement between simulated and real galaxy samples exists if one uses the correlation function test ( einasto , klypin & saar 1986 ) , the percolation and the filling factor tests for various density levels ( einasto et al .",

    "these tests have shown that statistical properties of simulated galaxies and clusters are very close to properties of real galaxies and clusters .",
    "in other words , the division of matter into the low - density primordial population in voids and the clustered population with galaxies and clusters in high - density regions describes well the actual distribution of galaxies and clusters .",
    "the next step in the comparison of simulations with the real universe was to investigate the possibility of using different threshold densities to approximate the distribution of galaxies of different morphology and luminosity .",
    "it is well known that bright galaxies are concentrated to central dense regions of groups , and that faint companion galaxies are located in outskirts of groups ( einasto et al .",
    "1974b ) . dressler ( 1980 ) extended the density relationship to morphological types  elliptical galaxies are located mostly in dense regions and spirals in less - dense environments .",

    "now we shall compare the distribution of simulations with galaxies using the 2-d simulation described above .",
    "the analysis of the density field in the local supercluster by e94 shows that the threshold density , @xmath55 , which divides the non - clustered matter located in voids and clustered matter associated with galaxies , is approximately equal to the mean density .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of cen & ostriker ( 1992 ) also indicate that the galaxy population is located in regions of matter density above the average when smoothed on 1 @xmath15  mpc  scale .",
    "a more detailed hydrodynamical simulation by weinberg et al .  ( 1997 ) shows that the distribution of gas particles of different temperature is very different in regions of different local density : the heating and successive cooling of gas occurs only in over - dense regions .",
    "we take the mean density as the threshold density , @xmath56 .    in figure  1",
    "we present the distribution of void , field and cluster particles in a ( 90  @xmath15  mpc)@xmath57 region of the above simulation .",
    "we used a threshold density @xmath56 to separate void particles from clustered ones , and @xmath58 to separate field particles from particles in clusters .",
    "panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) show the distribution of void , cluster , and field populations , respectively . for comparison",
    "we show in panel ( d ) the distribution of real galaxies in supergalactic coordinates in a sheet which crosses the local , the coma and the southern corner of the hercules supercluster .",
    "we see that simulated particles in voids are distributed rather uniformly , while particles in the field are distributed along well - defined filaments , and cluster particles form essentially spherical systems .    to check the possibility that @xmath55 is different from 1 we have compared the distribution of particles in the density intervals @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; see figure  1 .",
    "particles with @xmath60 form filaments in less - dense environments and are absent in voids . their distribution resembles the distribution of dwarf galaxies which form weak filaments in super - voids , i.e. in voids defined by clusters of galaxies ( see panel ( d ) , more detailed distributions are given in figure  5 of lindner et al .",
    "1995 , and in figure  3 of lindner et al .",
    "this comparison shows that the use of density threshold to select various simulated galaxies is well suited to discriminate cluster and field galaxies , and among field galaxies to locate weak and massive filaments .",
    "this example shows that , at least for this simulation , the threshold density values used reproduce well the actual distribution of galaxies of different type .",
    "our figure shows also that there exists no one - to - one relationship between the distribution of simulated particles selected in small threshold density intervals and real galaxies chosen in small luminosity intervals .",
    "the reason for the absence of a very close relationship is clear : dwarf galaxies are located also in clusters and in other high - density regions .",
    "however , mean statistical properties sensitive to the distribution of galaxies in low - density environment ( such as the void diameter distribution ) are rather similar for galaxy samples of various limiting absolute magnitudes and for simulated galaxy samples using variable threshold density levels ( lindner et al .  1995 , 1996 , frisch et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the previous analysis has shown a good agreement between the distribution of simulated and real galaxies .",
    "this analysis gives , however , no answer to the question , how accurately galaxies follow the distribution of matter in high - density regions : groups , clusters and superclusters .",
    "direct observational data on the distribution of galaxies and matter are needed to clarify this problem .",
    "the distributions of the density of galaxies and matter in groups were found to be essentially similar ( einasto et al .",

    "we ignore the difference in concentration of bright and faint galaxies in groups , also we ignore the fact that within dark halos of galaxies the distribution of baryonic and dark matter is different . since large differences occur only on sub - mpc scales , these differences do not influence the power spectrum on scales of interest for the present paper .",
    "a comparison of the distribution of matter and light in clusters of galaxies is possible using several of the indicators of the matter distribution , like e.g. gravitational lensing , x - ray emitting gas distribution , or galaxy dynamics .",
    "these studies show that the matter and luminosity distributions are rather similar , the concentration of light is more pronounced than that of matter , similar to the concentration of bright galaxies in groups ( david et al .  1990 , carlberg 1994 , bhringer 1995 , squires et al .",

    "such small differences can influence the overall amplitude of the power spectrum as shown in the analysis of results of numerical simulations with different threshold densities and a sample of particles with positions shifted in high - density regions ( for details see the next subsection ) ; the shape changes only on scales comparable to the size of clusters ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the comparison of the distribution of matter and light in superclusters is possible using numerical simulations .",
    "simulations show that in large high - density regions ( superclusters ) more primordial matter contracts to form clusters of galaxies than in regions of lower density where systems of galaxies have lower richness .",

    "we use the term `` biasing '' to denote the difference between the distribution of the whole matter and the matter associated with galaxies . already in early stages of cosmological studies it was clear that the evolution of density perturbations in under- and over - dense regions is completely different ( z70 ) , which explains the presence of voids since matter in low - density regions can not contract and form galaxies ( je78 , ejs80 ) .",
    "thus the discovery of voids was a clear indication for the dominating role of the gravity in the evolution of the universe on large scales .",
    "this leads us to our basic assumptions that the evolution of the structure on scales of interest is due to gravity , and that density fluctuations are gaussian and adiabatic .",
    "these assumptions have two important consequences .",
    "first , the evolution of under- and over - dense regions is completely different : the density in under - dense regions decreases ( approximately exponentially ) but never reaches zero ; the density in over - dense regions increases until the matter collapses ( z70 , ejs80 ) .",
    "collapsed regions form a web of intertwined filaments and knots ( je78 , einasto et al .",
    "1983 , melott et al .",
    "1983 , bond et al .",
    "1997 , cen & simcoe 1997 ) .",
    "second , in order to form a galaxy or a system of galaxies , the clump of primordial matter must have a density exceeding some critical limit in a given volume ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "for these reasons the galaxy formation is a density threshold phenomenon .",
    "dynamical studies of galaxies and clusters have shown that the dominating population in the universe is dark matter which forms halos around galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies . practically all massive galaxies are located in groups or clusters ; the brightest form main galaxies of groups , other group members are dwarf companion galaxies ( einasto et al .",
    "1974b , zaritsky et al .  1993 )",
    ". the characteristic size of groups of galaxies is of the order 1  @xmath15  mpc(einasto et al .  1984 ) ,",
    "thus , in order to find the _ true _ density field of matter in the universe the discrete distribution of galaxies ( and particles in numerical simulations ) is to be smoothed using a smoothing scale of the order of the size of groups , i.e. about 1  @xmath15  mpc(einasto & saar 1986 ) .",
    "conventionally the biasing is defined through the local density contrast , which is calculated from a smoothed density field using a smoothing scale of the order of 10  @xmath15  mpc .",
    "excessive smoothing mixes unclustered dm in voids and clustered dm in high - density regions which makes the simple biasing phenomenon rather complicated .",
    "to avoid excessive smoothing we define the biasing parameter using the difference in power spectra of populations , in our case of the population of all galaxies with respect to matter .",
    "we apply no additional smoothing , i.e.  power spectra are calculated from particle positions , and the density field is calculated by interpolation of these positions on a grid which has a scale of the same order as real systems of galaxies .",
    "we use density also to find the population membership of particles , either void particle in low - density regions or simulated galaxy ( with dark halo ) in high - density regions . here",
    "again we interpolate particle positions within the grid .    in the determination of the density at the location of particles",
    "we tacitly assume that dm is non - baryonic and consists of particles of small mass .",
    "under this assumption we can consider dm as a fluid which has a continuous density field .",
    "as shown by dynamical observations and numerical simulations , dm forms density enhancements around galaxies and in clusters of galaxies .",
    "the distribution of luminous matter differs from the distribution of dm on galactic and cluster scales .",
    "there exists no indication for large - scale segregation between luminous and dark matter .",
    "we have investigated the influence of possible small differences in the spatial distribution of luminous and dark matter to power spectra of galaxies and matter .",
    "our results show that on scales of interest for the present study these differences are small or negligible .",
    "our study demonstrates that the main difference between power spectra of galaxies and matter is the amplitude only , which is determined by the fraction of particles in high - density regions .",
    "small differences in the spatial distribution and in the density threshold are the reason for cosmic scatter of the biasing parameter around the value defined by the fraction of particles in high - density regions ; this error in the density threshold is of the order of 10  % or less .",
    "the density distribution ( figure  4a ) shows that a 10  % error in the threshold density leads to a 3  % error of the fraction of matter in the clustered population .",
    "biasing parameter values @xmath83 are possible only for samples with a very large deficit of particles in high - density regions ( see figure  2 of paper i ) .",
    "such a large deficit is not supported by observation , as the mass - to - luminosity ratio of groups of galaxies is approximately the same as in clusters .",
    "a small deficit of luminous matter in rich clusters ( high mass - to - luminosity value ) is simulated in our test sample gal-120 : its power spectrum has a lower amplitude as defined by the number of particles , but only by a few per cent .",
    "this adds a component to the cosmic scatter of the biasing parameter .",
    "the main lesson from this study is that the gravitational origin of the structure evolution poses strict limits to the biasing parameter .",
    "it is determined by the fraction of total matter in low- and high - density regions .",
    "as matter flows continuously away from low - density regions , the fraction of matter in high - density regions remains between 0.5 ( the initial value ) and 1 ( the limit in very far future ) during the whole evolution of the structure .",
    "thus the corresponding biasing parameter of galaxies relative to matter lies between 2 ( initial value ) and 1 ( limit in the future ) .",
    "these values apply if galaxies exactly follow the distribution of particles in high - density regions .",
    "our analysis has shown , that differences of the distribution of galaxies and matter in high - density regions may change these theoretical biasing parameter values by up to ten per cent .",
    "the second lesson learnt is that both the amplitude ( i.e. the biasing parameter ) _ and _",
    "the shape of the power spectrum change very little due to possible disturbing effects .",
    "the amplitude is changed considerably only in the case when galaxy samples are incomplete in high - density regions .",
    "the shape is changed by differences in the concentration of matter and galaxies in groups , clusters and superclusters , but this affects the power spectrum on small scales only ( see table  1 and figure  2 ) which is of less importance for the present study .",
    "we have followed this approach to the biasing problem motivated by the discovery of the difference in the distribution of galaxies and matter ( je78 , ejs80 ) .",
    "it is a bit surprising that in the majority of studies on this subject the problem has been complicated by smoothing over large scales .",
    "the latter distorts the distribution of void particles and the clustered matter .",
    "we have studied the evacuation of voids and the concentration of matter to high - density regions through numerical simulations .",
    "we used the rms density fluctuation on a 8  @xmath15  mpc  sphere , @xmath0 , as a parameter which characterizes the epoch of the simulation .",
    "we determined the present value of this parameter from the power spectrum of galaxies , @xmath84 .",
    "we find two relations for @xmath63 and @xmath34 , and derive values for both parameters .",
    "we find the fraction of matter in the clustered population @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "these data yield a value @xmath87 for the bias parameter of all galaxies relative to matter .",
    "the amplitude of matter density fluctuations can be fixed on two different scales .",
    "cobe data measure the amplitude of density fluctuations on very large scales ( e.g. bunn & white 1997 ) . on galactic scales",
    "the amplitude of density fluctuations is quantified by the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the problem here is how to link the distribution of galaxies to that of matter . to avoid this difficulty white , efstathiou & frenk ( 1993 ) used an indirect method , based on the cluster abundance ( number density ) .",
    "cluster abundance depends on the amplitude of density fluctuations and density parameter , @xmath88 .",
    "previously , the @xmath89 relation was found as @xmath90 ( eke , cole & frenk 1996 , viana & liddle 1996 , pen 1996 , cen 1998 ) .",
    "bahcall , fan & cen ( 1997 ) , fan , bahcall & cen ( 1997 ) and carlberg et al .  ( 1997 ) point out the fact that the evolution of cluster abundance depends strongly on @xmath0 , making it possible to determine both parameters separately . combining the observed abundance of local rich clusters ( bahcall & cen 1992 , 1993 ) with cluster evolution data yields the following parameters : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . using a similar method eke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find @xmath94 , @xmath95 for an open universe , and @xmath96 , @xmath97 for a flat universe with a cosmological constant .",
    "bahcall & fan ( 1998 ) find @xmath98 based on similar arguments . a simple estimate of the cluster mass in the comoving volume from which that mass originated yields a mass - density estimate of the universe @xmath99 ( carlberg et al .  1996 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the standard cdm model can be excluded at a confidence level of more than 99% .",
    "for comparison we note that cobe normalization provides @xmath100 for scdm , lcdm , and ocdm , respectively .",
    "as @xmath63 calculated from cobe normalization is an extrapolation from 1000  mpc to 10  mpc scales , based on certain models of structure evolution , the ( dis)agreement between the direct determination of @xmath0 and cobe extrapolation to this scale can be considered as evidence for the quality of the model used",
    ".    within the errors our value of the @xmath0 parameter coincides with those suggested by carlberg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , bahcall , fan & cen ( 1997 ) and eke et al .",
    "a recent determination of the density parameter and @xmath0 by bahcall & fan ( 1998 ) from the abundance of rich clusters of galaxies at high redshifts yields a rather high value , @xmath101 ; however , the error is large .",
    "since we used completely different input data , our determination is independent of previous ones .",
    "moreover , our method uses directly observed power spectra and simple gravitational physics of void evacuation , thus the danger of the presence of large systematic errors is small .",
    "we may conclude that this parameter is now known rather reliably .    using the integrated power spectrum",
    "we can also determine the excess power parameter , @xmath102 , introduced by wright et al .",
    "we find @xmath103 and @xmath104 , from the power spectra @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "both values are close to the value @xmath107 found by wright et al .",
    "a similar power spectrum shape parameter was introduced by borgani et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the error of @xmath63 depends on the errors of @xmath62 and @xmath64 .",
    "we have no reason to believe that the amplitude of the observed power spectrum of galaxies has a considerable systematic error .",
    "thus we can accept the quoted error of @xmath62 as a realistic one .",
    "the fraction of matter in galaxies derived from numeric simulations is less certain .",
    "but we can estimate upper and lower limits for this quantity . ejs80 and e94 have found analytic approximations for several simple scenarios for the evacuation of voids ( planar and spherical void models ) .",
    "negative and positive density fluctuations grow simultaneously , and the present fraction of matter in voids ( and in the clustered population ) depend on the effective epoch of structure formation ( collapse ) , @xmath108 .",
    "we find ( see figure  7 of e94 ) that for the linear void and wall model we obtain @xmath109 , if @xmath110 , while spherical void models give @xmath111 . as a collapse at very early and very late epochs can safely be excluded , these simple models suggest that the present value of the fraction of matter in the clustered population must lie in the interval @xmath112 . using these limits",
    "we get @xmath113 .",
    "our accepted value @xmath114 lies just in the middle of this interval .",
    "if we consider the limits derived from these simple analytic models as @xmath115 errors , we get for @xmath116 error 0.05 , in good agreement with the error estimate calculated from formal errors of parameters used to find @xmath63 .    to conclude the discussion we stress again that @xmath63 characterizes the rms amplitude of density fluctuations on galactic scales , similar to cobe observations which fix the amplitude of density fluctuations on a scale of @xmath117  mpc .",
    "direct observables are the rms galaxy density fluctuations at the present epoch , @xmath62 , and rms temperature fluctuations at the recombination epoch , respectively . in both cases , matter density fluctuations at the present epoch",
    "are calculated using theoretical models which involve simple physics , through the evacuation of voids and the growth of the amplitude of density fluctuations , respectively for @xmath63 and cobe cases . these methods to calibrate density fluctuations on different scales are complementary and independent , i.e.  a correct model must pass both checks .",
    "in cosmological studies the linear bias factor is often defined through the @xmath0 parameter ( @xmath118 , see brodbeck et al .",
    "actually these quantities are independent parameters , the bias parameter characterizes the difference in amplitude of power spectra of galaxies and matter , and the @xmath0 parameter the present amplitude of density fluctuations of matter on galactic scales .",
    "the main goal of this paper was to elaborate methods to determine these two parameters , and to apply methods using actual data .",
    "our approach to the biasing phenomenon is based on the observation that there exist large voids in the galaxy distribution .",
    "this is a clear indication that the evolution of the structure in the universe is primarily due to gravity .",
    "further we assume that primordial density fluctuations are gaussian and adiabatic .",
    "we have shown that under these assumptions the formation of galaxies is a threshold phenomenon , i.e. that in under - dense regions galaxies do not form at all , and that in over - dense regions galaxies and matter are distributed very similarly ( ignoring differences on galactic scales ) .",
    "our first conclusion from the biasing analysis is that all matter in the universe is divided into two main populations , the unclustered primordial matter in voids and the clustered matter in high - density regions associated with galaxies .",
    "our analysis and high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation show that the threshold density which divides the unclustered matter in voids and the clustered matter associated with galaxies , is approximately equal to the mean density of matter , if smoothed on scales comparable to the characteristic scale of groups of galaxies ( about 1  @xmath15  mpc ) . using higher threshold densities",
    "it is easy to select galaxies located in filaments , while a still higher threshold density corresponds to galaxies in groups and clusters . using intermediate threshold density intervals",
    "it is even possible to simulate statistically populations of galaxies of different luminosity .",
    "we have investigated the influence of the density threshold to power spectra of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the population of clustered particles is derived from the population of all particles by the exclusion of particles located in low - density environments .",
    "our analysis shows that power spectra of galaxies and clusters are similar in shape to the power spectrum of all matter , the main difference being in the amplitude .",
    "the power spectrum describes the square of the amplitude of the density contrast , i.e. the amplitude of density perturbations with respect to the mean density .",
    "if we exclude from the sample of all particles a population of approximately constant density ( void particles ) and preserve all particles in high - density regions , then the amplitudes of _ absolute _ density fluctuations remain the same ( as they are determined essentially by particles in high - density regions ) , but the amplitudes of _ relative _ fluctuations with respect to the mean density increase by a factor , which is determined by the ratio of mean densities , i.e. by the fraction of matter in the new density field with respect to the previous one . our analysis has shown that actual differences in amplitudes of power spectra of simulated galaxies with respect to the power spectrum of all matter , are almost exactly equal to differences calculated from the number of particles in respective samples , i.e. the fraction of matter in high - density regions , @xmath119 .",
    "this fraction determines the biasing parameter of the sample of all galaxies with respect to matter .",
    "we have determined the fraction of matter in high - density regions using numerical simulations of structure evolution for various cosmological models .",
    "our analysis shows that the evolution is model dependent : in models with high cosmological density voids are evacuated more rapidly and less matter is left in high - density regions .",
    "a problem with numerical simulation of the void evacuation is how to identify the present epoch in these simulations .",
    "we have done this using the calibration through the mean amplitude of density fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath120  @xmath15  mpc , @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 can be determined directly from the observed power spectrum of galaxies by integration , and it is related to the corresponding parameter for matter , @xmath121 , through an equation similar to the equation which relates amplitudes of power spectra of matter and galaxies , with the fraction of matter in galaxies ( clustered matter ) .",
    "simulations yield another relation between @xmath121 and @xmath119 , which allows us to determine both unknown parameters .",
    "we obtain @xmath84 for galaxies , @xmath122 for matter , and @xmath3 for the biasing factor of the clustered matter ( galaxies ) relative to all matter .",
