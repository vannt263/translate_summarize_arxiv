    "in this work both radiative shocks ( rs ) arising in astrophysics and those generated in laboratory are studied .",
    "as these rs are involved in all stages of stellar evolution ( accretion shocks , pulsating stars , supernovae and interstellar medium ) , accurate modeling is needed and , therefore , experimental results are used to validate our codes . until now our team performed rs experiments  @xcite using the high - power laser at laboratoire dutilisation des lasers intenses ( cole polytechnique ) . in laboratory",
    ", the plasma can be considered at local thermodynamical equilibrium and optically thick or intermediate  @xcite . with specific radiative hydrodynamics codes",
    "@xcite , we study these rs structures since at high - mach numbers ( @xmath4 ) they exhibit precursor .",
    "+ on the other hand in astrophysics , the plasma is often optically thin  @xcite and radiation escapes without interaction with the surrounding material .",
    "its role can be modeled  @xcite by a cooling function @xmath5 .",
    "the main objective of analytical modeling suggested here is to predict the extension of the optically thin cooling zone behind the rs front .",
    "we consider the equations presented in @xcite , but in this paper they are solved analytically for any @xmath6 proportional to a power law of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this case only the post - shock region ( psr ) is structured by cooling like for polars where a rs arises for magnetic white dwarf accreting neighboring star material .",
    "+ in addition , we attempt to calculate the precursor length of steady laboratory rs . based on drake s work  @xcite",
    ", we switch the cooling function by a equivalent system which represents the radiation flux propagating towards the precursor . in next experiments scheduled in 08 on lil ( bordeaux , france ) , we plan to probe psr using x - ray diagnostics . with analytical solutions of the above astrophysical model",
    ", we can predict the structure of psr for these experiments . in the same way",
    ", experimental results of the post - shock cooling will allow to validate our astrophysical codes , since by confrontation with analytical results we can determine the main physical process _",
    "i.e. _ the value of the exponents in @xmath6 .",

    "we consider a one dimensional ( 1d ) stationary rs where propagation is along @xmath10 and @xmath7 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 represent respectively mass density , velocity , temperature and @xmath8 is the pressure . with a cooling function @xmath6 ,",

    ", the cooling function may have the following form ( @xmath15 is constant ) : @xmath16 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are three exponents , the value of which is defined according to the considered physical processes . in order to solve the system",
    ", we have to introduce in eq .",
    "( [ eq1cool ] ) a minimal value @xmath17 to prevent a singularity at @xmath18 and we have to define the boundary conditions .",
    "+      first of all , we introduce a new dimensionless variable @xmath19 where @xmath9 represents the cooling psr length",
    ". then the inverse of the local compression ratio is @xmath20 .",
    "as the integration is done from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , the solution diverges with a value of @xmath7 going to infinity .",
    "therefore the boundary conditions are given by the value of @xmath23 at the shock front ( @xmath24 ) and they depend on the type of considered shock at the other end ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we have to cut the curve at @xmath26 as soon as @xmath7 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 satisfies chosen boundary conditions . at the shock front side ,",
    "the compression ratio for a stationary shock is given by rankine - hugoniot conditions versus @xmath4 : @xmath27 as an example , the rear shock will be modeled by wall conditions in the case where the rs represents the plasma falling onto a white dwarf in polar type cataclysmic variable with @xmath28  @xcite ( see polar rs in section  [ sec : polar ] ) . in the case of a bow shock",
    "ahead a young stellar jet , boundary conditions are pressure equilibrium  @xcite , _ i.e. _ the rear pressure must be equal to the mach disk pressure given by observations .",
    "further discussions about boundary conditions are in @xcite .",
    "+ we also extend this analytical solutions to predict the evolution of the precursor in the case of a strong rs in optically thick medium .",
    "the radiative flux is replaced with the function @xmath29 in standard equations and boundary conditions are given by the gas density in the precursor .",
    "now let continue with the resolution of these equations in psr , in optically thin medium .",
    "+      in this section , we can not detail each calculation step which will be the subject of a next article .",
    "considering the appropriate boundary conditions ( see eq .",

    "polars stars are a class of cataclysmic variables ( binary system with an accreting compact object ) in which the strong magnetic field of the white dwarf ( first star ) completely dominates the accretion flow of the system .",
    "indeed the matter of the second star follows the magnetic lines of the white dwarf up to its poles and falls down on its surface in an accretion rs . in psr , a cooling layer forms that is described with a cooling function as seen before . to produce this cooling zone , the involved physical process is an optically thin bremsstrahlung radiation  @xcite with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in eq .",

    "the analytical development differs from eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) . under these approximations",
    "the precursor length @xmath9 is found equal to 200 @xmath40 which is in agreement with the steady - state limit in previous experiments and simulations  @xcite .",
    "this result is interesting because it strongly links an astrophysical analytical aspect to laboratory experiments .",
    "we have solved and generalized calculations of the cooling psr for any couple @xmath41 .",
    "to apprehend future experiments , another parameter which is extremely interesting to estimate is the accreted column density @xmath42 ( see fig .  [ column ] ) .",

    "this point is important to introduce the real physics in numerical simulation codes .",
    "the purpose of this calculation is to predict the cooling zone length behind the stationary rs . since we expect to probe this region , we need to know future target size and diagnostic position .",
    "we have generalized the analytical solutions of the model for any cooling function and compared them with previous numerical work  @xcite and with some trivial analytical solutions  @xcite .",
    "although we have recovered already known results , we have derived additional classes of solutions .",

    "based on recent drake s work  @xcite , we can apply same calculation to evaluate the length of the radiative precursor of laboratory radiative shocks .",
    "moreover with equations of the post - shock zone we can prepare future experiments on lasers even more powerful than lil as lmj or nif , under condition to reach a stationary shock regime . as a result",
    ", we can emphasize the occurring physical processes through the exponent determination in the cooling function . as a conclusion ,",
