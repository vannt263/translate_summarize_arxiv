    "the start - up of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has enabled the exploration of previously inaccessible domains of heavy particles , which are at the core of various extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . a distinguished class of modifications of the particle content of the sm attributes the smallness of the masses of observed neutrinos to the presence of a seesaw mechanism . in such a setup",
    "the neutrino masses can be realized through an effective dimension - five operator @xmath8 @xcite which can be generated both at the tree and at the loop level . at the tree level",
    "there are three realizations of the dimension - five operator @xcite , all of them based on an addition of a single new multiplet : type - i @xcite , type - ii @xcite and type - iii @xcite seesaw mechanisms , mediated by heavy fermion singlet , scalar triplet and a fermion triplet , respectively .",
    "thereby , the fermionic type - i and iii models involve hypercharge zero heavy majorana mediators .",
    "originally , the seesaw scale was linked to high energy gut scale , while a recent reincarnation of @xmath9 gut model which within the adjoint 24 representation contains both a singlet and hypercharge zero fermion triplet , providing a low scale hybrid type - i and iii seesaw model @xcite . in a multiple seesaw approach",
    "first put forward in @xcite and later extended in @xcite , the involved additional fields and additional discrete symmetries are instrumental in bringing the seesaw mechanism to the tev scale @xcite accessible at the lhc .    in the recently proposed approach of @xcite , which we are scrutinizing here , the lowering of the seesaw scale has been achieved without use of discrete symmetries . by relying only on the gauge symmetry and the renormalizability of the sm",
    ", we arrived at novel seesaw mechanism supported by nonzero hypercharge fermions in higher isomultiplets .",
    "such a line of research follows from our examination @xcite of the vectorlike top partner , which by a sort of dirac seesaw mechanism increases the mass of the top @xcite .",
    "we then extended our quark - sector study to the leptons , to explore a possible role of tev - scale vectorlike dirac fermions as seesaw mediators .",
    "indeed , the heaviness of the top quark and the lightness of the higgs boson have been the landmarks for several extensions of the sm which rely on vectorlike rather than on sequential fourth generation fermions .",
    "we have observed that there are two options that such states , in conjunction with appropriate new scalar fields , act as seesaw mediators : via the triplet fermions already introduced in @xcite and via the fermion 5-plet proposed in @xcite .",
    "the dimension nine ( dim 9 ) operator produced at the tree level in the latter case leads to the seesaw formula @xmath10 , which reproduces the empirical neutrino masses @xmath11 ev with sub - tev 5-plet mass @xmath12 .",
    "this calls to investigate the phenomenology of new dirac - type heavy leptons as the subject of our present study .",
    "let us note that the focus of a study in ref .",
    "@xcite with their exotic nonzero hypercharge triplet fermions has been on the accompanied triply - charged scalars , whereas a more recent study @xcite considered the effects of these triplet fermions on the lfv decays of charged sm leptons . in addition , some further constraints on exotic triplets have been placed very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present study of exotic 5-plet fermions can be compared to previous studies of hypercharge - zero triplets belonging to type - iii seesaw mechanism : the earlier one performed by franceschini et al .",
    "@xcite and a subsequent by li and he @xcite , which has some overlap with more recent study @xcite of type - iii triplets appearing also in already mentioned hybrid type - i and iii seesaw model @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe a tree - level seesaw model based on nonzero hypercharge fermions and point out the nonminimal ( conjunct ) appearance of exotic fermions and scalars needed for dim 7 and dim 9 seesaw mechanisms .",
    "section 3 deals with the production rates , and section 4 with the subsequent decays of exotic 5-plet states .",
    "we summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "the details on the mixing between light and heavy leptons are exposed in the appendix .",
    "as a distinctive feature of the sm , the observed fundamental matter fields ( quarks and leptons ) are distributed in the lowest possible representations of the sm group , @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the leptonic left - handed doublets and the right - handed singlets , there is also the sm higgs doublet , @xmath14 .",
    "the values @xmath15 of the weak isospin @xmath16 and hypercharge @xmath17 , indicated in the parentheses , @xmath18 reproduce the electric charges @xmath19 of the respective multiplet components .",
    "higher , isotriplet multiplets @xmath20 and @xmath21 are already familiar from type - ii and iii seesaw models , and it is obvious that we may encounter a 5-plet of zero hypercharge as the simplest generalization of type - iii seesaw majorana triplet to a higher - isospin multiplet .",
    "incidentally , such a @xmath22 fermion multiplet has been singled out in the literature as a viable minimal dark matter ( mdm ) candidate @xcite .",
    "it provides a completely neutral ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) component of an additional @xmath0 multiplet , and the minimality refers to its isolated appearance : mdm is realized as a single additional exotic matter particle coupled to the sm fields .",
    "+ however , our concern here is with the seesaw models where exotic fermionic seesaw mediators appear together with appropriate exotic scalar isomultiplets .",
    "thereby , in order to add something new to already existing seesaw mechanisms , we employ vectorlike fermionic multiplets with nonzero hypercharge .",
    "in contrast to chiral sm fermions , the masses of such vectorlike fermions are not restricted to the electroweak scale , so that they can be naturally adjusted to the new physics scale .",
    "if in a novel seesaw mechanism the new physics appears already around the tev scale , then this scenario would not suffer from an additional , seesaw - induced hierarchy problem .",
    "in order to produce a tree - level seesaw , the newly introduced fermion multiplets have to have a neutral component which will mix with light neutrinos . accompanying",
    "new scalar multiplets also have to have a neutral component which can acquire the vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) .",
    "as exposed to more detail in the next subsection , these requirements together with the sm gauge symmetry lead to rather restricted viable quantum number assignments for the new multiplets : the one with vectorlike triplet fermions introduced in @xcite leading to dim 7 seesaw operator , and the vectorlike fermion 5-plet introduced by @xcite leading to dim 9 seesaw operator .",
    "the effective operators of the form @xmath25 have already been studied in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite , where it has been pointed out that the mass operator at each higher dimension is unique , independent of the mechanism leading to it .",
    "the model pursued here starts from three generations of sm model leptons represented by @xmath26 and @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ smfields ] ) and adds to them @xmath28 isospin @xmath29 vectorlike 5-plets of leptons with hypercharge two , where both left and right components transform as @xmath30 under the electroweak part of the sm group , @xmath31 besides the sm higgs doublet @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ smfields ] ) there are two additional isospin @xmath33 scalar multiplets @xmath34 and @xmath35 transforming as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively : @xmath38 explaining the neutrino masses by dim 9 operator leads to the exotic matter shown in eqs .",
    "( [ fiveplet ] ) and ( [ fourplets ] ) . concerning the fermion fields",
    "@xmath1 , they should be vectorlike in order to avoid the chiral anomaly .",
    "the extra scalar fields are constrained by a requirement of the renormalizability of the extended sm , restricting the lagrangian of the scalar sector to dimension 4 terms .",
    "accordingly , the weak isospin of the exotic scalar fields ( @xmath39 ) can not be higher than three half , in order that they couple linearly with the higgs field and develop an induced _ vev _ after the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the sm gauge group . for this reason",
    ", the scalar fields should be in multiplets which contain electrically neutral components .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ events ] we list all possible events coming from the decays of the neutral and singly - charged 5-plet states to the sm charged leptons .",
    "this includes the same - sign dilepton events as a distinguished signature at the lhc .      besides previous decays , there are also decays of @xmath40 to a lighter @xmath41 state .",

    "such decays are suppressed by small mass differences , except for @xmath46 where the mass difference @xmath47 between the @xmath46 and @xmath48 state is large enough to enable also the two pions in the final state .",

    "this will result in @xmath610 decays @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we have investigated the testability of exotic heavy leptons introduced to explain small neutrino masses .",
    "it is conceivable that such states additional to the sm leptons may appear as higher representations such as isospin 2 heavy fermions in conjunction with isospin 3/2 heavy scalar fields studied here .",
    "the lhc could provide enough energy and luminosity to produce and study such heavy particles if they mediate the proposed seesaw mechanism .",
    "in particular , the decays of new heavy leptons to sm particles depend on how light and heavy leptons mix with each other .",
    "our seesaw model constrains the mixing to be small , given by the square root of the ratio of light and small masses , @xmath68 .",
    "this suppresses their effects on the flavor physics , but the abundant production of new states invites us to investigate the phenomenology of these heavy leptons at the lhc .    for @xmath2 of integrated luminosity , the present lhc ( @xmath3 tev ) run can produce in total 270 ( 7000 ) @xmath1-@xmath4 pairs of heavy leptons with mass @xmath69 , among which there would be @xmath70 triply - charged @xmath46 or @xmath64 fermions .",
    "thereby , the triply - charged @xmath46 has the biggest production cross - section , @xmath71 , and singly - charged @xmath72 has the smallest but still comparable @xmath73 .",
    "the production cross - sections for all other particles and antiparticles from a 5-plet are in between .",
    "notably , the production of triply - charged leptons is followed with its golden decays @xmath7 . for a chosen mass @xmath66 and the mixing @xmath67",
    "we expect @xmath610 golden mode events .    the great advantage of the processes considered in this paper , common to most seesaw - inspired models , is the copious production of energetic leptons , which provides a clear experimental signature and relatively small sm background .",
    "detailed studies of standard seesaw scenarios @xcite demonstrate that final states with 2 ( same sign ) and 3 or 4 charged leptons can be increasingly easily distinguished from the sm background .",
    "for the model at hand , similar results are expected .",
    "for example , our prominent production channel @xmath74 results in 3 or more energetic charged leptons in roughly one third of cases .",
    "additionally , when it is experimentally possible to separate final - state particles coming from each of the two produced heavy leptons , then the three same - sign leptons coming from a single heavy - lepton lead to distinctive signature of the presented model .",
    "the corresponding sm background is essentially negligible , similarly to what has been demonstrated in @xcite in generic new physics scenario with lepton number violation .    to conclude , the exotic 5-plet leptons introduced to explain small neutrino masses can be observed at lhc . at the designed lhc luminosity and @xmath75",
    "tev our 5-plet tree level seesaw model is falsifiable for sub - tev @xmath1-lepton masses , while for masses which are outside of the lhc reach the 5-plet leptons remain viable for generating radiative neutrino masses . in this sense , we hope that the involved predictive and testable vectorlike fermion 5-plet may establish an exciting link between collider phenomenology and the origin of neutrino masses .",
