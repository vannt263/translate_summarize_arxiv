    "the host galaxies of short gamma ray bursts ( sgrbs ) exhibit a wide range of physical properties .",
    "sgrbs have been found not only in star - forming hosts , but also in elliptical galaxies with strong upper limits on their star formation rate ( hereafter `` quiescent hosts '' ) ( prochaska et al 2006 ; berger 2008 ) .",
    "in contrast , long gamma ray bursts ( lgrbs ) are found exclusively in star forming galaxies ( e.g. , le floch et al 2003 , fruchter et al 2008 , savaglio et al 2009 ) .",
    "several lines of evidence now link lgrbs with the deaths of massive stars ( hjorth et al 2003 , stanek et al 2003 , fruchter et al 2006 , raskin et al 2008 ) .",
    "the origin of the sgrbs is not firmly established , but suspicion centers on merging neutron star binaries , or other phenomena primarily associated with neutron stars ( belczynski et al 2006 ; chapman , priddey , & tanvir 2008 ) . hosts offer one of the best tools for unveiling the nature of the grb progenitors , because the properties of the gamma ray emission and afterglow are decoupled from many important details of the progenitor objects under the fireball model of grbs ( e.g. paczyski & rhoads 1993 , katz 1994 , piran 2005 ) .",
    "the situation is similar to supernovae , which divide into two groups , the type ia and the core collapse events ( which include types ii , ib , and ic ) .",
    "core collapse events are found only in star forming galaxies , and are associated with the deaths of stars having initial masses @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , type ias are found in both quiescent and star forming hosts , and are thought to be powered by the nuclear explosion of a white dwarf whose mass is pushed above the chandrasekhar limit by accretion .",
    "however , despite having a characteristic progenitor mass set by fundamental physics , the ia supernovae are not entirely homogeneous in their properties .",
    "those found in star forming hosts are both more frequent ( per unit stellar mass ) and more luminous than their cousins in quiescent galaxies ( hamuy et al 1995 ; scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ; sullivan et al 2006 ) .    in this _ letter _ , we look for similar trends linking the propertie of sgrbs and their hosts .",
    "we find an anticorrelation between sgrb isotropic energy and host galaxy luminosity .",
    "we find no obvious selection effects that could produce such an effect , nor do we find evidence for any similar effect in a larger control sample of lgrbs .",
    "we take our sgrb sample from the compilation by berger ( 2008 ; hereafter b08 ) of all sgrbs localized by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on the swift satellite ( gehrels et al 2004 ) .",
    "this sample contains 23 sgrbs , of which 12 have reported redshifts . these 12 form the core sample for our study .",
    "they are further divided into 6 with optical afterglows , and hence the most accurate positions and most secure host galaxy identifications ( `` sample 1 '' of b08 ) , and 6 with somewhat less accurate positions based x - ray data alone ( `` sample 2 '' of b08 ) .",
    "the two subsamples are similar in most properties ( b08 ) .",
    "we also form a comparison sample of 34 long bursts , by combining host galaxy information from savaglio et al ( 2008 ) with burst durations from the gcn circulars and other grb properties from amati et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "we calculate host galaxy absolute magnitudes as @xmath1 . here",
    "r is the observed r - band magnitude from b08 , and @xmath2 is the luminosity distance , calculated assuming @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting absolute magnitude corresponds to rest wavelength @xmath6 . for our sgrb sample ,",
    "this always between u and r band , and typically near b band ( hence our notation ) . we calculate the isotropic equivalent gamma ray energy of the bursts directly from their fluence @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent energy of the sgrbs is correlated with the absolute magnitudes of their host galaxies , with a correlation coefficient of 0.60 .",
    "that is , the brightest bursts tend to occupy the least luminous hosts , and vice versa ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eiso_absmag]a ) .",
    "this is _ not _ expected from simple observational selection effects .",
    "if the samples are largely limited by flux and/or fluence , with most objects near the detection threshold , the range of distances in the sample should then lead to a _ positive _ correlation of burst energy with host luminosity .",
    "such a positive correlation _ is _ seen for our control sample of long grbs ( figure  [ fig : eiso_absmag]b ) .",
    "the least luminous sgrbs are the closest , while the least luminous hosts span a wide range of redshifts .",
    "gamma ray sensitivity limits inclusion in our sample more critically than does sensitivity to the host galaxy s starlight .",
    "if the host is not detected in the first relevant observation , more data can be taken , but if the grb is not detected in the first observation , it can never enter the sample .",
    "if a low - luminosity event such as grb 050509b occurred in a subluminous host at @xmath9 , we should still see it .",
    "we see perhaps one such event , grb 070724 , which has low isotropic energy and luminosity , but lives in a star forming host galaxy .",
    "we would also expect that if a highly luminous sgrb occurred in a large elliptical host galaxy , we should be able to observe such an event ( and its luminous host ) out to @xmath10 .",
    "we see no such events .",
    "this suggests that the more luminous sgrbs are associated with young progenitors of some type that is absent in old elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have tested the significance of the correlation in figure  [ fig : eiso_absmag]a using a spearman rank correlation test .",
    "the test yields a rank correlation coefficient of @xmath11 and a significance level of @xmath12 with 10 degrees of freedom .",
    "formally , this corresponds to a 95% significance .    however , the true significance is higher , since observational selection effects work to produce the opposite sign of correlation .",
    "we have performed simple simulations of the correlation produced by observational selection in the absence of any true , physical relation between the burst and host properties .",
    "we first constructed independent probability distributions for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . to these , we added selection probabilities based on gamma - ray fluence and host apparent magnitude .",
    "each of these probability distributions was specified by a simple , plausible functional form .",
    "the functions were adjusted until the simulations were able to reproduce separately the 1d marginal distributions of @xmath7 , @xmath13 , @xmath16 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 seen in the data ( all within the poisson uncertainties ) .    in each simulation , we constructed a `` parent sample '' of bursts , and applied the selection probabilities to simulate a `` selected sample , '' whose size is constrained to equal that of the observed sample .",
    "we then measure the correlation coefficient between   and @xmath14 in the simulation .",
    "we repeat this procedure many times , and compare the distribution of simulated correlation coefficients to that measured in the observed sample .    among @xmath17 simulations , only 121 have coefficients above the observed value .",
    "thus , by considering selection effects , we estimate the significance of the sgrb energy - host luminosity anticorrelation at about 98.8% .",
    "while the simulations include several _ ad hoc _ functional forms , they capture the essential points of any realisitic model that does _ not _ have correlations between burst and host properties .",
    "first , the bursts and hosts span a wide range of intrinsic brightness .",
    "second , the rate as a function of redshift could be matched by the volume element modified by some modest amount of rate evolution .",
    "third , the observational selection functions are monotonically decreasing over the range from the brightest to the faintest observed sgrbs and hosts .",
    "fourth , the selection on the sgrb fluence excludes many more simulated events than does the selection on host luminosity .",
    "this induces a relatively weak correlation between host and burst brightness in the simulated samples .",
    "more strongly peaked intrinsic properties , or a more even balance between rejection by either grb or host properties , would tend to induce stronger correlations in the simulated sample .",
    "thus , plausible changes in our simulations should not strongly affect our conclusions .",
    "our results do depend substantially on grb 050509b : if we exclude it from the sample , the remaining 11 observed points yield a correlation coefficient of 0.28 .",
    "this corresponds to about a 14% chance in the simulations . for comparison",
    ", a hypothetical sample of about 40 sgrbs with a true correlation coefficient 0.28 would be significant at the same the 99% level as our full sample .",
    "provided that the identification of the grb 050509b host is regarded as secure , the correlation does not depend critically on other bursts without optical transients .",
    "if we use the subset of sgrbs with optical transients ( b08 s `` sample 2 '' ) plus grb 050509b ( which has no ot but still a rather secure host detection ) , the correlation coefficient becomes 0.63 , and the simulations show a significance level of 95.6% .    for reference , our control sample of lgrbs shows a correlation coefficient of -0.54 between isotropic energy and host absolute magnitude .",
    "we adapted our simulations to reproduce the marginal distributions of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath14 , and so forth for the lgrb sample , and again compared the distribution of correlation coefficients to that observed for the lgrbs .",
    "formally , this too yields a difference at the 99% level between the simulations and the data , here in the sense that the data show a stronger _ positive _ correlation between grb and host brightness than do the simulations .",
    "because the sign of the correlation matches the sign of the selection effects , and because the correlation is driven substantially by the x - ray flashes ( 020903 and 060218 ) at the bottom of the lgrb   distribution , we do not attach great physical significance to this result yet .",
    "however , it is intriguing and may merit further investigation in future .    , green means @xmath18 , and red means @xmath19 .",
    "for lgrbs , cyan means @xmath20 , blue means @xmath21 , green means @xmath22 , red means @xmath23 , and magenta means @xmath24 . [",

    ", cyan means @xmath20 , blue means @xmath21 , green means @xmath22 , red means @xmath23 , and magenta means @xmath24 . [",
    "fig : eiso_absmag],title=\"fig : \" ]    we also examined the relation between sgrb gamma ray luminosity and host galaxy star formation rate per unit stellar mass . because the two most luminous sgrb hosts are early type galaxies , with tight upper limits on their emission - line derived sfr ( prochaska et al 2006 , berger 2008 , savaglio et al 2008 ) , this plot clearly separates these two sgrbs from the rest of the sample .",
    "the specific star formation rate is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the star formation rate , and @xmath27 the stellar mass of the galaxy . however , lacking the data to fit an accurate stellar mass to some galaxies , we use the quantity @xmath28 . to demonstrate the utility of @xmath29 ,",
    "we compared it to the published @xmath30 ( from savaglio et al 2008 ) for the 34 lgrb hosts from our control sample .",
    "we find @xmath31 , with a scatter of @xmath32 dex ( rms ) .    the results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfr_lgam]a ) show that the separation of the sgrb hosts into actively star forming galaxies and old stellar populations is accompanied by a separation of burst gamma - ray luminosity , with only the least luminous bursts found in the old hosts . the corresponding plot for lgrbs ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ssfr_lgam]b ) shows no correlations beyond the sample selection requirement that the least luminous events be reasonably nearby .",
    "a comparison of the two figures also shows the tendency ( noted previously by , e.g. , b08 ) for even star - forming sgrb hosts to have less vigorous star formation ( i.e. lower @xmath29 ) than do lgrb hosts , and also the tendency for sgrbs to have lower gamma ray fluxes .     and specific star formation rate .",
    "point labels follow the same definitions as in figure  1 . [",
    "fig : ssfr_lgam],title=\"fig : \" ]   and specific star formation rate .",
    "point labels follow the same definitions as in figure  1 .",
    "[ fig : ssfr_lgam],title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "while our sample is small , the anticorrelation between sgrb @xmath13 and host luminosity is probably real , based on our monte carlo simulations .",
    "the similar anticorrelation between brightness of type ia supernovae and the stellar population ages of their host galaxies was first described on the basis of a similarly small sample ( 13 supernovae ; hamuy et al 1995 ) .",
    "we now examine possible interpretations for this result .",
    "suppose , first , that two distinct mechanisms produce sgrbs .",
    "such a situation would arise naturally if two or more of the different proposed progenitors actually do produce sgrbs .",
    "combinations that have been explored include coalescence of double neutron star binaries and of ns - black hole binaries ( belczynski et al 2006 ; oshaughnessy et al 2008 ; troja et al 2008 ) , and combinations of ns - ns binaries with giant flares from magnetars ( chapman , priddey , & tanvir 2008 ) .",
    "additionally , a range of sgrb properties might arise from ns - ns binaries alone , provided those binaries evolved through a range of different binary interaction histories ( belczynski et al 2006 ; salvaterra et al 2008 ) .",
    "if one mechanism is associated with stars younger than 1 gyr , and the other with ancient populations ( age @xmath33 ) , we can explain the properties of figures  [ fig : eiso_absmag]a and [ fig : ssfr_lgam]a .",
    "the fraction of old - progenitor sgrbs occurring in quiescent galaxies should match the fraction of stellar mass in quiescent galaxies .",
    "the present , limited data shows two bursts in quiescent hosts , and a third similarly low - luminosity burst ( 070724 ) in a star - forming host galaxy .",
    "this matches well the fraction of stellar mass in elliptical galaxies at low redshift , which is 54% to 60% ( baldry et al 2004 ) .",
    "conversely , the fraction of more luminous sgrbs occurring in quiescent hosts is @xmath34 in the present sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfr_lgam]a ) . under a two - population scenario ,",
    "the mechanism responsible for the more luminous sgrbs should have a negligible rate for ages exceeding a few gyr .",
    "if instead there is a single , continuous distribution of sgrb and host properties , it suggests that the sgrb progenitor s properties vary systematically with either age or metallicity , which vary systematically along the hubble sequence and have direct effects on stellar - scale physics .",
    "if sgrbs are due to binary neutron star inspiral events , an anticorrelation of sgrb energy and the specific star formation rate of the host galaxy could come from the dependence of inspiral time and available energy on mass .",
    "gravitational radiation gives an inspiral time of @xmath35 ( e.g. , landau & lifschitz 1958 ) , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the masses of the two bodies , @xmath38 is the semimajor axis of their orbit , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are newton s constant and the speed of light .",
    "thus , if a star formation event yields a population of compact object binaries with a range of mass , we expect a range of inspiral times .",
    "the sgrbs occurring in quiescent hosts would be those with low masses and/or wide initial separations .",
    "the available energy reservoir is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the characteristic size of the system when the grb energy is released . if the sgrb event produces a black hole , we expect @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 . then , for @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "characteristic stellar ages for sgrb hosts range from @xmath47 gyr for quiescent hosts , to @xmath48 gyr for typical star forming sgrb hosts ( see , e.g. , savaglio et al 2008 ) .",
    "if this tenfold range of age corresponds to a tenfold range of @xmath49 , it would imply a range of @xmath50 in neutron star mass , which is comparable to the range of ns masses believed to exist in our galaxy .",
    "however , the corresponding @xmath51 range of energy can not explain the range of  observed in figure  [ fig : eiso_absmag]a .",
    "a larger range in sgrb energetics might follow if @xmath52 , especially for a neutron star equation of state that gives @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 may correlate with @xmath36 and @xmath37 in some complex way depending on on both binary star mass transfer and detailed supernova physics .",
    "while a more thorough understanding of the sgrb mechanism is clearly required before we can fully model the relation between host and sgrb properties , the existence of such a relation will provide valuable clues to the nature of the short grbs .    the correlation in figure  [ fig : eiso_absmag]a",
    "can also provide a tool for estimating sgrb redshifts . @xmath55 and @xmath14 are related empirically by @xmath56 . defining @xmath57 , so that @xmath58 and @xmath59 $ ] , we can substitute for @xmath13 and @xmath14 to obtain a distance estimate : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the sgrb fluence in units of @xmath62 . the conversion from @xmath63 to the estimated distance @xmath64 and redshift @xmath65 must of course",
    "follow the cosmology we used to derive equation  [ eq : dist_est ] .",
    "for our primary sample of 12 sgrbs , the rms residual in @xmath66 is @xmath67 dex , and in redshift @xmath68 is 0.147 .",
    "the residuals from the fit substantially exceed the uncertainties expected from fluence and host magnitude measurements , implying that most of this scatter is intrinsic .    as an alternative",
    ", we can directly fit a relation of the form @xmath69 by minimizing @xmath70 .",
    "this approach gives @xmath71 , with @xmath72 .",
    "this redshift estimator is easier to apply , and is formally independent of the adopted cosmological parameters , though it is less directly linked to whatever physical mechanism links @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "differences between the predicted redshifts from the two equations are all much smaller than the scatter in either .",
    "another possibility is that the external medium around sgrbs plays some role in their luminosity .",
    "the interstellar medium is typically less dense in elliptical galaxies than in actively star forming galaxies .",
    "however , this should only affect the observed flux from external shocks that grb ejecta drive into the ambient medium .",
    "external shocks are believed to power the afterglow emission , but not the grb luminosity itself ( e.g. , piran 2005 ) . since our observed anticorrelation involves the sgrb @xmath73-ray flux itself , we disfavor this explanation .    to conclude",
    ", we have found an anticorrelation between the energy of a short gamma ray burst and the luminosity of its host galaxy .",
    "such an anticorrelation occurs with a probability of @xmath74 in simulations that account for observational selection effects , and so is probably real .",
    "its physical origin is unclear , though it is most likely due to a correlation between the age of an sgrb progenitor and the luminosity of the explosion .",
    "if this correlation is a continuous distribution , it can provide approximate redshift estimates for sgrbs .",
    "time will tell whether this correlation holds for a larger sample , and whether it is a property of a single distribution , or if it instead reflects an underlying division of sgrbs into two physically distinct sets .",
