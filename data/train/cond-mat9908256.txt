    "investigations into the interplay of disorder and many - body interactions continue to receive a lot of attention mainly due to the persistent current problem @xcite and the experimental discovery of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) metal - insulator - transition ( mit ) @xcite . in order to theoretically study this interplay , in principle with increasing system size",
    "one has to solve a problem with an exponentially growing number of states in the hilbert space . at present , this can be achieved only for a few particles in 1d @xcite and very few particles in 2d @xcite .",
    "shepelyansky @xcite  following earlier work of dhorokov @xcite  proposed another approach looking at the properties of _ two _ interacting particles ( tip ) in a random environment .",
    "the tip hamiltonian is @xmath2 with positions @xmath3 , @xmath4 of each particle on a chain of length @xmath5 , hopping probability @xmath6 ( which we use to define the energy scale , i.e. , @xmath7 ) , onsite interaction strength @xmath8 , and random potentials @xmath9 $ ] for disorder @xmath10 .",
    "shepelyansky suggested that even for repulsive interactions the two particles would form pairs with larger localization length @xmath0 than the two separate single particles ( sp ) .",
    "thus the interaction would enhance the possibility of transport through the system @xcite .",
    "the perhaps even more surprising prediction was that at pair energy @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath1 is the sp localization length .",
    "since @xmath13 in 1d , this implies large values of @xmath0 for small disorders @xmath10 .",
    "the first numerical studies devoted to the tip problem used the transfer matrix method ( tmm ) to investigate the proposed enhancement of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "other direct numerical approaches to the tip problem have been based on the time evolution of wave packets @xcite , exact diagonalization @xcite , variants of energy - level statistics @xcite and multifractal analysis @xcite , green function approaches @xcite , perturbative methods @xcite and mappings to effective models @xcite . in these investigations usually ( but not always @xcite ) an enhancement of @xmath0 compared to @xmath1 has been found but the quantitative results tend to differ both from the analytical prediction in eq .",
    "( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) , and from each other .",
    "furthermore , a check of the functional dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 is numerically very expensive since it requires very large system sizes @xmath14 .",
    "extensions of the original arguments have been proposed for higher dimensions @xcite , tip close to a fermi sea @xcite and long - range interactions in 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite .    in this paper , we present numerical results for the interaction matrix elements and show that a correct statistical description necessitates the use of the _ logarithmic _ instead of the commonly used arithmetic average .",
    "the resulting _ typical _ matrix element @xmath15 has a different disorder dependence than the arithmetic mean @xmath16 .",
    "following the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , the use of @xmath17 does not give rise to a power - law enhancement as in eq .",
    "( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) .",
    "however , taking into account the energy denominators , the power - law can be recovered but with a smaller power of , e.g. , @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "this value is in agreement with previous results in 1d @xcite .",
    "we further review results based on the application of the decimation method @xcite which allows for a direct computation of @xmath20 . augmenting the analysis with the finite - size - scaling ( fss ) approach @xcite",
    ", we construct estimates @xmath21 of the tip localization length in the infinite system @xcite .",
    "for @xmath22 they reproduce accurately the well - known dependence of @xmath1 on disorder while for finite @xmath8 , we find @xmath23 with @xmath24 varying between @xmath25 and @xmath26 . thus the enhancement persists , unlike for tmm @xcite , in the limit of large system size .",
    "finally , we apply the decimation method in 2d . again using fss we find scaling functions for @xmath27 which exhibit two branches corresponding to localized and extended behavior for tip in an infinite system , and we estimate the @xmath8 dependence of the critical disorder and the critical exponent at the transition .    before presenting our data",
    ", we briefly review the analytical approach to tip .",
    "the prediction of shepelyansky is based upon looking at the interaction matrix element of a pair state @xmath28 with another pair state @xmath29 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath30 denotes the sp eigenstate localized with @xmath1 around site @xmath31 and we can restrict the states by @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the interaction matrix elements are @xmath36 where we used the hubbard onsite interaction @xcite @xmath37 with the number operator @xmath38 at site @xmath39 and spin @xmath40 . assuming @xcite that the sp state is given as @xmath41 with @xmath42 a random phase , one finds @xcite that the average of @xmath43 has a magnitude of @xmath44    = 0.68    shepelyansky calculated the decay rate @xmath45 of a non - interacting eigenstate by means of fermi s golden rule @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "since the typical hopping distance is of the order of @xmath1 the diffusion constant is @xmath47 . within a time @xmath48 the particle pair visits @xmath49 states .",
    "diffusion stops when the level spacing of the visited states is of the order of the frequency resolution @xmath50 .",
    "this determines the cut - off time @xmath51 and @xmath52 in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) .",
    "applicability of fermi s golden rule requires @xmath53 which is equivalent to @xmath54 .",
    "this is exactly the condition for an enhancement of @xmath0 compared to @xmath1 . alternatively ,",
    "similar results can be obtained by mapping the model onto a random - matrix model with entries chosen according to eq .",
    "( [ eq - u ] ) @xcite .",
    "the qualitative arguments presented above should be checked for quantitative accuracy . even before doing so for eq .",
    "( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) , it is already worthwhile to test the validity of ( [ eq - u ] ) and the subsequent arguments .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the assumption of a gaussian distribution of @xmath43  necessary for taking the arithmetic or r.m.s .",
    "average  was oversimplified .",
    "we calculated @xcite the dependence of the averages on @xmath1 and system size . to this end , we diagonalized the 1d anderson model for given @xmath5 and @xmath10 and computed @xmath43 for all suitable states and many disorder configurations . in fig .",
    "[ fig - distribution ] we show the distribution of @xmath43 and the values of @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "= 0.68    additionally , we include results for an interaction with randomly varying onsite term @xmath55 and results for sp states with random phase as in eq .",
    "( [ eq - psi1 ] ) . based on these results",
    ", it was shown @xcite that due to the non - gaussian distribution of @xmath43 , one should use the logarithmic rather than the arithmetic average for @xmath43 .",
    "however , whereas @xmath56 @xcite , the logarithmic average obeys @xmath57 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - disdepend ] . following the arguments above",
    ", this would imply @xmath58 .",
    "we emphasize that this does not mean that there is no enhancement of @xmath0 .",
    "rather , the results @xcite indicate that the arguments of first - order perturbation theory @xcite capture the physics in a somewhat oversimplified form . noting the possibly quite different energies of the pair states",
    ", it appears more suitable to average @xmath43 only over such states which differ in energy by @xmath59 for @xmath19 , cp .",
    "[ fig - disdepend ] , implying @xmath60 in good agreement with previous data based on a wide variety of methods @xcite and also with the results of the next section .",
    "= 0.68    the first numerical investigations @xcite of @xmath0 used the tmm .",
    "two of us studied the tip problem by a different tmm @xcite at large @xmath5 and found that ( i ) the enhancement @xmath61 decreases with increasing @xmath5 , ( ii ) the behavior of @xmath0 for @xmath22 is equal to @xmath1 in the limit @xmath62 only , and ( iii ) for @xmath63 the enhancement @xmath61 also vanishes completely in this limit .",
    "therefore we concluded @xcite that the tmm applied to the tip problem in 1d measures an enhancement which is due to the finiteness of the systems considered .",
    "it is now well understood @xcite that the main problem with the tmm approach is that the enhanced @xmath0 is expected to appear along the diagonal sites of the tip hamiltonian , whereas the unsymmetrized tmms @xcite proceed along an sp coordinate .",
    "various new tmm techniques have been developed to take this into account @xcite , but still all tmms share a common problem : in general the @xmath22 result for @xmath0 does not equal the value of @xmath64 which is expected for non - interacting particles @xcite .",
    "rather , they yield @xmath65 and thus @xmath66 . therefore other methods appear to be more appropriate for the tip problem .    here",
    "we briefly review the results @xcite of another well - tested method of computing localization lengths for disordered systems , the decimation method @xcite where one replaces the full hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham ] ) by an effective hamiltonian for the doubly - occupied sites only . in accordance with the sp case @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0 is defined by the tip green function , @xmath67 , as @xcite @xmath68 we computed @xcite the green function at @xmath11 for 26 disorder values @xmath69 $ ] , for 24 system sizes @xmath70 $ ] , and 11 interaction strengths @xmath71 . for each triplet of parameters",
    "@xmath72 we averaged @xmath73 over @xmath74 samples . by fss of the @xmath20 data we obtained the infinite - size localization lengths @xmath21 shown in fig .",

    "[ fig - tipdm - xi0 ] .",
    "thus we do not see the quadratic behavior ( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) when using the fit function of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , after scaling the data onto a single scaling curve and fitting @xmath79 as proposed with @xmath80 @xcite , we find @xcite indeed @xmath80 for not too small disorder , e.g. , @xmath81 for @xmath19 , but observe a crossover to @xmath82 for smaller @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath83 the enhancement decreases again @xcite ; the position of the maximum depends upon @xmath10 .",
    "we thus find that the duality proposed @xcite for results at @xmath8 and @xmath84  which would imply a fixed maximum at @xmath85  is approximately valid .",
    "we remark that similar results are obtained when placing tip in different potentials @xcite which is of relevance for a proposed experimental test of the tip effect @xcite .",
