    "a fundamental difficulty underlying the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology is the prediction of an initial singular state where all curvature invariants and some material quantities like pressure , energy density and temperature become infinite@xcite .",
    "generically ,  the break down of the laws of physics at a singularity \" is a clear manifestation of mathematical inconsistency and physical incompleteness of any cosmological model . in this way , although strongly supported by the recent observations at low and intermediate redshifts , the present big - bang picture with dark energy must be improved at very high redshifts .    in order to solve such a problem several attempts based on many disparate mechanisms",
    "have been proposed in the literature .",
    "some earlier approaches trying to develop a well behaved and more complete cosmological description include : quadratic lagrangians and other alternatives theories for the gravitational field@xcite , a creation - field cosmology@xcite , a huge vacuum energy density at very early times@xcite , nonminimal couplings@xcite , nonequilibrium thermodynamic effects@xcite , and quantum - gravitational phenomena closely related to a possible spontaneous birth of the universe@xcite .",
    "more recently , a new interesting mechanism aiming to avoid the cosmic singularity has been discussed by de lorenci et al.@xcite through a nonlinear extension of the maxwell eletromagnetic theory . the associated lagrangian and the resulting electrodynamics",
    "can theoretically be justified with basis on different arguments .",
    "for example , the nonlinear terms can be added to the standard maxwell lagrangian by imposing the existence of symmetries such as parity conservation , gauge invariance , lorentz invariance , etc@xcite , as well as by the introduction of first order quantum corrections to the maxwell electrodynamics@xcite .",
    "it is worth notice that nonlinear corrections may also be important to avoid the black hole singularity .",
    "actually , an exact regular black hole solution has been recently obtained with basis on the einstein - dual nonlinear electrodynamics as proposed by salazar , garcia and plebansky @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the purpose of the present work is not to give a detailed description of the possible nonlinear theories and their physical effects .",
    "our basic aim is rather modest - we will try to gain new insights into the possibilities beyond maxwell theory based on the simplest nonlinear electromagnetic lagrangian and its connection to the cosmic singularity problem .    in this concern , it has been found @xcite that the primordial singularity can be removed because the nonlinear corrections reinforce the negative pressure at the early stages of the universe .",
    "the authors also argued that the nonsingular behaviour is unaffected by the presence of other ultrarelativistic components obeying the equation of state @xmath1 .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend the analysis by de lorenci et al.@xcite using different ingredients .",
    "we first obtain the behavior of the scale function for a spatially flat frw geometry ( @xmath2 ) , thereby showing that their results is a particular case of the general solution .",
    "it is also analyzed how this solution is modified by the presence of a @xmath3-term ( vacuum energy density ) which may be constant or a time varying quantity .",
    "solutions with constant vacuum energy density also leads to a non - singular universe , and the same happens with a time - dependent @xmath0-term .",
    "however , there are singular solutions where the decaying vacuum supplies the energy to a constant cosmological magnetic field . in this case",
    ", the time dependence of the cosmological term can uniquely be determined and corresponds to a slightly modification of the more frequent forms suggested in the literature@xcite .",
    "the main physical restrictions , including the time interval where the nonlinear corrections must be important are also discussed .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    ", we write down the einstein field equations ( efe ) for a flat frw geometry supported by an energy momentum derived from the extended ( nonlinear ) eletromagnetic lagrangian . in section",
    "[ s3 ] , we generalize the solution derived in @xcite which assumes a vanishing cosmological term , a spatially flat geometry and a time - dependent magnetic field . in section [ s4 ] , we obtain a new solution that takes into account the presence of a constant @xmath3 .",
    "the behavior involving a time - dependent @xmath3 is discussed in section [ s5 ] . finally , in the conclusion section",
    ", we summarize the basic results and also present some suggestions for future work . in",

    "as widely known , the lagrangian density for free fields in the maxwell electrodynamics may be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor and @xmath6 is the magnetic permeability .",
    "the canonical energy - momentum tensor is then given by @xmath7.\\ ] ]    in this work we consider the extended lagrangian density to the electromagnetic field @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are arbitrary constants , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the dual of @xmath13 . as one may check , the corresponding energy - momentum tensor becomes @xmath14 let us now consider the above expressions in the context of a homogeneous and isotropic frw flat model @xmath15\\;.\\ ] ] naturally , electromagnetic fields may source of the above background only if the fields are considered in its average properties@xcite .",
    "now , applying the standard spatial averaging process we set @xmath16 equations ( [ e7 ] ) - ( [ e11 ] ) imply that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the four velocity . under such conditions the average value of the energy - momentum tensor takes the perfect fluid form , namely : @xmath19 where the density @xmath20 and pressure @xmath21 have the well known form @xmath22    in order to analyze the modifications implied by the use of the modified lagrangian ( [ e3 ] ) , we also assume that for the stochastically defined electromagnetic fields only the average value of the squared magnetic field @xmath23 survives at the very early universe , i. e. , we use eqs .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) - ( [ e11 ] ) with @xmath24 . in this concern",
    ", we remark that a homogeneous electric field in a plasma must give rise to an electric current of charged particles and then rapidly decay . indeed ,",
    "unlike what happens with the magnetic field , at present there is no basis whatsoever to presume the existence of an overall electric field . indeed , since the late sixties , it has been recognized that cosmological models with an overall electric field bears hardly any relation at all to reality ( see for instance , zeldovich and novikov @xcite ) .",
    "naturally , this does not means that the @xmath25 term appearing in our stochastic approach can be neglected in comparison with @xmath26 , but one may expect that its influence might be small for some special regimes , as for example , when the plasma may be treated with basis on the magnetohydrodynamics approximation . for a dense ionized gas , for example",
    ", the collision frequency can be so high that the electric field and its momenta may arise only as a consequence of the motion of the fluid , or as a result of the external charges distribution or ( not  frozen in \" ) time - varying magnetic fields .",
    "such a behavior may happen in the primeval plasma ( below planck s temperature ) because the debye screening radius @xmath27 is very small in comparison with the macroscopic relevant scale for nonsingular world models , namely , the hubble radius @xmath28 . keeping these remarks in mind",
    ", we return to the basic equations by assuming that @xmath25 has been neglected so that ( [ e14 ] ) still holds , but the energy density and pressure now read    @xmath29    note that the weak energy condition ( @xmath30 ) is obeyed for @xmath31 whereas the pressure will reach negative values only if @xmath32    on the other hand , there is a widespread belief that the early universe evolved through some phase transitions , thereby yielding a vacuum energy density which at present is at least @xmath33 orders of magnitude smaller than in the planck time@xcite .",
    "such a discrepancy between theoretical expectation ( from the modern microscopic theory of particles and gravity ) and empirical observations constitutes a fundamental problem in the interface uniting astrophysics , particle physics and cosmology , which is often called `` the cosmological constant problem '' @xcite .",
    "this  puzzle \" together with the observations of type ia supernovae@xcite suggesting that the cosmic bulk of energy is repulsive and appears like a dark energy ( probably of primordial origin ) stimulated the recent interest for more general models containing an extra component and accounting for the present accelerated stage of the universe @xcite .",
    "a possible class of such cosmologies is provided by phenomenological models driven by a constant or a time - dependent @xmath0-term ( see , for instance , [ 14 - 16 , 24 - 30 ] and references therein ) .",
    "the effective time - dependent cosmological term may be regarded as a second fluid component with energy density , @xmath34 , which transfers energy continuously to the material medium .",
    "the conditions under which this kind of cosmology can be described by a scalar field coupled to a perfect fluid has also been discussed in the literature [ 24 - 30 ] . for the sake of generality , we focus our attention to a decaying @xmath3 model , but now in the presence of the primeval magnetic field . in the background defined by ( [ e6 ] ) , the efe read @xmath35 @xmath36 while the energy conservation law can be written as @xmath37 where an overdot means derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath38 .",
    "as we shall see , for a constant magnetic field it is not need to assume a phenomenological expression for @xmath0 as usually done since it can be uniquely fixed from the above set of equations .    replacing ( [ e17 ] ) and ( [ e18 ] ) in the einstein equations ( [ e21 ] ) - ( [ e23 ] ) we get @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 inserting equations ( [ e17 ] ) and ( [ e21 ] ) into ( [ e22 ] ) we find @xmath42 the term proportional to @xmath43 comes from the nonlinear correction in the lagrangian .",
    "note also that if the coupling constant @xmath44 is zero , the standard frw differential equation for a radiation filled universe plus a cosmological @xmath3-term is recovered . by solving any two of the above equations one may discuss if the nonlinear terms added to the maxwell lagrangian",
    "may alter the primeval singular state . in order to compare with some previous results presented in the literature ,",
    "we start our analysis by considering some interesting particular cases .",
    "this is the case studied by de lorenci et al.@xcite where a particular nonsingular solution was found . in",
    "what follows the corresponding general solution is given and we also show how to recover the quoted result .",
    "first of all , we remark that if @xmath45 is a time - dependent quantity and @xmath3 remains constant , equation ( [ e26 ] ) can be easily integrated to give @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant of integration . in this paper ,",
    "the subscript @xmath48 does _ not _ mean the present day value of a quantity .",

    "we stress that the scaling solution ( [ e27 ] ) holds even for a nonvanishing constant @xmath3 . inserting @xmath54 into ( [ efe1 ] )",

    "this happens because the arbitrary integration constant @xmath49 was chosen to be @xmath62 the time behaviour of the magnetic field is readily obtained from ( [ e27 ] ) and ( [ e31 ] ) .",
    "one finds @xmath63 with the energy density and pressure defined by eqs .",
    "( [ e17 ] ) , ( [ e18 ] ) , respectively .",

    "alternatively , we observe from the relation ( [ e17 ] ) that this solution is recovered for values of t where the magnetic field obeys the condition @xmath69 the most interesting feature of ( [ e31 ] ) is that the quadratic function inside the parenthesis does not have real roots @xmath70 , being positive for any @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the model is non - singular with @xmath50 reaching the minimum value @xmath71 at a time @xmath72 .",
