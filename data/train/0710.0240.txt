    "* parametric amplification together with stimulated emission are fundamental mechanisms for generation of coherent radiation .",
    "laser action is based on the latter whereas the former is the basis of optical parametric oscillations ( opos ) .",
    "even though , laser systems are encountered worldwide thanks to their intense commercialization , opos are , nowadays , more and more spreading ( and not only in laboratories ) owing , essentially , to their tunability on a wide range of frequencies .",
    "in fact , for a laser the emitted frequency is fixed once and for all to the manufacturing . in consequence , a pile of several lasers of different frequencies is needed when the operating system involves a whole range of frequencies .",
    "we thus measure the considerable advancement that opos bring to modern optical technology where large frequency variations are desired .",
    "although the basic principles of optical parametric amplifiers ( opas ) have been known for over 40 years , opos developed quickly only in the last decade mostly for technological reasons @xcite .",
    "the use of periodically varying media greatly enriches the diversity of observable phenomena either in opas or in opos , allowing for existence of coherent field patterns , the study of which is the main goal of the present paper . *",
    "compared to lasers , opos have received much less attention in spite of their strong interest both on the fundamental and on the technological sides @xcite .",
    "we recall that these are very frequency agile coherent sources with a wide range of possible applications including range finding , pollution monitoring and tunable frequency generation .",
    "they are also the key element for the production of twin photons and the realization of fundamental quantum optics experiments @xcite .",
    "basically an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) generates light via a three - wave mixing process in which a nonlinear crystal subjected to a strong radiation at frequency @xmath0 ( pump beam ) radiates two coherent fields at frequencies @xmath1 ( signal beam ) and @xmath2 ( idler beam ) such that the energy conservation law @xmath3 is satisfied .",
    "this energy conservation criterion may be interpreted in terms of photons where one photon at frequency @xmath0 is converted into two photons at frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this process is most efficient when the phase matching condition is fulfilled .",
    "it states that optical parametric amplification is favored when the three interacting waves keep constant relative phases along their propagation inside the crystal .",
    "this implies @xmath6 or equivalently @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the wavevector and the refractive index at frequency @xmath10 respectively ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "opos have recently appeared as physical systems whose modeling generates specific problems sharing common grounds with very general open questions such as those related to the appearance of complexity in spatially extended systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , opos have become one of the most active fields in nonlinear optics not only for the richness in nonlinear dynamical behaviors @xcite but also for the potential applications of opo devices @xcite , including low - noise measurements and defection @xcite .",
    "when driven by an intense external field , both opas ; i.e. corresponding to a single pass through the quadratic crystal , and opos show a number of remarkable features among them are the localized structures ( ls ) or spatial solitons @xcite .",
    "these nonlinear solutions are generated in the hysteresis loop involving stable homogeneous states and the nonhomogeneous periodical branches of solutions .",
    "the latter that initiate the ls formation result from the modulational instability ( often called turing instability ) and have been intensively studied in nonlinear optical cavities @xcite .",
    "stability of lss and effects of spatial inhomogeneities on the ls dynamics have been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "very recently another type of ls in the form of dissipative ring - shaped solitary waves have been generated in the regime where the steady state solutions are stable with respect to the modulational instability .",
    "indeed , it has been shown in @xcite that opos can continuously generate spatially periodic dissipative solitons with an intrinsic wavelength .",
    "these modulations spontaneously develop from _ localized _ perturbations of the _ unstable _ homogeneous steady state that separates the two stable states of an hysteresis cycle .",
    "this constitutes the counterpart of turing spontaneous modulations initiated by _ extended _ perturbations .",
    "they occur in the wings of the 2d traveling flat top solitons ( fronts , domain walls or kink - antikink ) and give eventually rise to ring - shaped propagating dissipative solitons .",
    "such non - turing periodic dissipative solitons have also been predicted in liquid crystal light valve nonlinear optical cavity @xcite .    in the more general context of optics",
    "the soliton ability to self - confine light beam power makes it a promising candidate for future applications in information technology @xcite and image processing @xcite . in this context ,",
    "an issue of important significance is the development of a research activity aiming at taking advantage of more sophisticated geometries of cavities  @xcite and periodic modulations of the refractive index  @xcite to generate , control , and stabilize optical ls .",
    "the existence of quadratic gap solitons in periodic structures , having spatial extension much bigger than the period of the structure , and thus well described within the framework of the multiple scale expansion , was studied in @xcite .",
    "the control and stabilization of ls are possible since periodic transverse modulations are known , with the advent of photonic crystals , to profoundly affect spatial soliton properties @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of the formation and the dynamics of localized structures in presence of transverse periodic modulations of the refractive index in both opas and opos , concentrating on field patterns whose spatial scales are of order of the period of the medium .",
    "this is actually the main distinction of our statement from the previous studies exploring either slow envelope lss  @xcite or the tight - binding limit leading to nonlinear lattice equations  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "optical parametric wave - mixing systems are one of optical devices that can operate either as a conservative ( opas ) or a dissipative ( opos ) system .",
    "we have analytically investigated the existence and stability of conservative ls ( or solitons ) that appear in opas and the dissipative periodic patterns occurring in a parametric oscillation regime ( opos ) .",
    "we have first identified the simultaneous conditions required on index modulation together with the incident pump for stationary ls to exist by means of bloch waves approach .",
    "it results from our analysis that in a degenerate configuration ( the signal and idler are identical ) signal and pump fields can be found in form of phase locked ls ( real solutions ) .",
    "they are strongly stable and located at the minimum of the index periodic modulation . to extend the analytical analysis to higher nonlinear regimes",
    "we have performed numerical simulations that allowed characterizing the different types of stable ls that can be supported by the system under transverse periodic modulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly recall the two - wave model governing the spatio - temporal evolution of the slowly varying envelopes of the pump and the signal waves including diffraction and transverse periodic modulation of the refractive index .",
    "the general conditions required for the existence and stability of conservative ls appearing in opas , by means of bloch waves approach , are given .",
    "extension of bloch waves approach to take into account dissipative effects stemming from cavity losses is carried out in section iii , for a degenerate opo with transverse periodic modulations , where for construction of periodic solutions we use a kind of inverse engineering allowing us to determine the external field from a given structure of the nonlinear bloch state .",
    "concluding remarks are summarized in the last section .",
    "we start with the model describing optical parametric amplification where we take into account diffraction and the transverse periodic change of the refraction index ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) . in the degenerate configuration , the signal and idler fields are identical leading to the resonant frequency conversion @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the pump and signal frequencies respectively . considering beam propagation along the @xmath17-direction , the nonlinear interaction of the two waves propagating in the crystal is governed by the system  @xcite :    [ eq_12 ] @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the envelopes of the pump and the idler , respectively .",

    "hereafter an overbar stands for the complex conjugation",
    ".    we will be interested in periodically varying refractive indexes .",
    "let us further specify the model considering @xmath24 to be independent on frequency , i.e. assuming @xmath25 this assumption is not essential for construction of the field patterns , reported below , and is introduced only for the sake of concreteness , as the approaches we will consider involve numerical simulations . thus , the theory developed here is straightforwardly generalized to any relation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , provided that their spatial periods coincide ( as it happens in a typical experimental situation ) .    for perfect phase - matching , @xmath28 , the system ( [ eq_12 ] ) , ( [ eps01 ] )",

    "another integral is given by the total power @xmath32 , where we have introduced a notation @xmath33 for the power of the @xmath34-th component , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "in what follows , existence domain and properties of non - uniform stationary solutions will be investigated .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we address in the present work the situation of @xmath36-independent spatial patterns , i.e. we assume @xmath37 . without loss of generality we can impose that @xmath38 is a @xmath39-periodic function ( this can be always achieved by proper renormalization of the coordinate units ) .",
    "then it is convenient to introduce a periodic function @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and to define two linear operators @xmath42 and the respective eigenvalue problems @xmath43 here @xmath44 are the linear bloch waves , with the index @xmath45 standing for the number of the allowed band and @xmath46 designating the wavevector in the first brillouin zone ( bz ) , @xmath47 $ ] . in this paper",
    "we will also use the notations @xmath48 for the lower ( `` @xmath49 '' ) and the upper ( `` @xmath50 '' ) edges of the @xmath51-th band , and @xmath52 for a @xmath51-th finite gap ( @xmath53 designating the semi - infinite gaps ) .    for a general form of @xmath54 ,",
    "the introduced linear eigenvalue problems ( [ eq:1deigen ] ) represent hill equations  @xcite and , as it becomes clear below , play crucial role in the systematic construction of the nonlinear localized modes ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "let us first investigate the existence of the different types of solutions of the conservative system ( [ eq_12 ] ) , which are homogeneous in @xmath17-direction .",
    "hence , we seek for non - uniform ( @xmath55-dependent ) stationary solutions of the system ( [ eq_12 ] ) in the form : @xmath56 where we have taken into account the matching conditions @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath28 . substituting the ansatz ( [ eq3 ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ eq_12 ] ) we obtain    [ eq_56 ] @xmath59    where @xmath60 is a spectral parameter of the problem .    system ( [ eq_56 ] ) is considered subject to the boundary conditions @xmath61 corresponding to localized patterns in the @xmath55-direction .",
    "now we establish several general properties of the solutions .",
    "first , multiplying ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) respectively by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , adding conjugated equations , and integrating over @xmath55 we obtain a necessary condition for existence of the localized modes : @xmath64    next we notice that the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , corresponding to the effectively one - dimensional case we are interested in , can be written down in the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the hamiltonian of the two - wave interactions in the homogeneous medium and @xmath67 describes the effect of the periodicity .    assuming that a solution @xmath68 of eq .",
    "( [ eq_56 ] ) is given , we consider its infinitesimal shift @xmath69 in the space , i.e. @xmath70 . for the solution to be stable , the introduced shift must lead to increase of the energy .",
    "thus for such a solution we obtain the conditions  @xcite @xmath71 the first one is nothing but eq .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) obtained above from the energetic arguments , while the second constrain acquires specific meaning for the definite symmetry solutions and will be considered below .      in this section",
    "we prove that spatially localized solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_56 ] ) are real . to this end , by analogy with @xcite , we set @xmath72 , define @xmath73 , and rewrite ( [ eq_56 ] ) in the form    [ explicit ] @xmath74    where @xmath75 .",

    "( [ explicit3 ] ) and considering the limit @xmath79 together with the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) we find out that a necessary condition for the existence of nonsingular solutions is that @xmath80 using the definition of @xmath81 and @xmath82 this constrain can be rewritten as follows @xmath83 \\nonumber \\\\      & & = |\\rho_0(c)|^2\\theta_{0,x}(c )     = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have taken into account eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and performed integration by parts . from the last line of the above equalities we conclude that @xmath84 does not depend on @xmath55 , and thus without restriction of generality it can be chosen zero so that @xmath85 can be chosen real .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) implies that @xmath86 is real .",
    "thus one has two options : either @xmath87 is real or @xmath87 is pure imaginary .",
    "however , one readily concludes from the system ( [ eq_56 ] ) that the second option can be reduced to the first one by changing @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we will restrict our analysis to real stationary fields @xmath89 .",
    "for the sake of concreteness and to simplify the consideration below we set @xmath90 to have a definite parity . then recalling the second of the constrains ( [ cond2 ] ) we conclude that a solution which also has a definite parity , i.e. such that @xmath91 , and strongly localized about @xmath92 , can not satisfy ( [ cond2 ] ) if @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , for strongly localized stable solutions eq.([cond2 ] ) is satisfied only if @xmath92 is a minimum of the periodic function @xmath54 .",
    "thus we can conjecture that stable solutions will be obtained centered about the minimum of the potential .",
    "thus , we restrict further consideration to the case @xmath94 and consider @xmath95 either even or odd .    as the next step",
    "we prove that among such solutions only even are allowed , or in other words we prove the following    if @xmath96 is a real solution of ( [ eq_56 ] ) with the potential ( [ pot ] ) , such that @xmath97 , then necessarily : @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "first we prove that @xmath85 is even . assuming the opposite , i.e. that @xmath85 is an odd function and integrating ( [ eq5 ] ) with respect to @xmath55 over the whole axis we obtains @xmath100 .",
    "thus @xmath101 and ( [ eq5 ] ) becomes linear and hence does not allow for the existence of spatially localized solutions .",
    "the contradiction we have arrived to , proves the claim that @xmath85 must be even .",
    "now we can prove that @xmath102 is an even function . again assuming that it is odd , what implies that @xmath103 , and designating @xmath104 the lowest nonzero derivative of @xmath102 at @xmath92 , such that @xmath105 as @xmath106",
    ", from ( [ eq5 ] ) we obtain that such a solution exists only if @xmath107 , and consequently from ( [ eq5 ] ) @xmath108 .",
    "now one can estimate the orders of all terms in ( [ eq6 ] ) at @xmath106 as @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , i.e. ( [ eq6 ] ) can not be satisfied in the vicinity of @xmath92 .",
    "we thus again arrive at the contradiction with the supposition about the existence of the solution .",
    "let us now turn to the asymptotics of the solutions at @xmath112 .",
    "since in this limit , @xmath113 , it follows directly from ( [ eq6 ] ) that @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a decaying to zero solution of the hill equation  @xcite @xmath116 this equation has decaying ( growing solutions ) only if @xmath117 belongs to a forbidden gap of the `` potential '' @xmath118 ( here we will not consider the cases where @xmath119 coincides with an edge of a gap ) .",
    "this last requirement we formulate as @xmath120 for some positive integer @xmath121 .",
    "then it follows form the floquet theorem that @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a constant , @xmath124 is the corresponding floquet exponent , defined by the frequency detuning to the gap , and @xmath125 is the real @xmath126periodic function .",
    "let us now turn to ( [ eq5 ] ) , and notice that it can be considered as a linear equation for the unknown @xmath85 . taking into account , that for decaying solutions @xmath127 , @xmath119 must belong to a gap @xmath128 , of the potential @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath129 [ we emphasize that the frequency @xmath119 here is the same as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) ] , we arrive at a necessary condition for existence of the localized modes : there must exist a nonzero intersection between gaps @xmath128 and @xmath130 for at least some integers @xmath121 and @xmath131 .",
    "then , designating this intersection by @xmath132 , i.e. @xmath133 and referring to it as a _ total gap _ , we conclude that if for a given @xmath119 a localized mode exists , then @xmath134",

    "the floquet exponents @xmath147 and corresponding bloch functions @xmath148 and @xmath149 must be computed .",

    "finally , by varying the shooting parameter @xmath123 one has to satisfy the condition @xmath154 at the origin @xmath92 ( recall that we are looking for even solutions ) .",
    "let us now show several possible solutions of the system ( [ eq_56 ] ) .",

    "this is an overlap of the first gaps of each of the equation .",
    "the profiles of the corresponding solutions for different @xmath119 inside the total gap are shown in the right panels of fig.[fig_1 ] .",
    "in all the pictures presented one observes that the amplitude of the signal is appreciably larger than the amplitude of the pump .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the mode itself ( it is two - component in our case ) decays and the pump amplitude become very small as the frequency approaches the bottom of the total gap .",
    "notice that the top and bottom of the total gap coincide with the top of the gap for the pump signal and with the bottom of the gap for the signal .",
    "we also observe that the pattern of the pump is more sophisticated than the pattern of the signal component .    to investigate the stability of obtained solutions we integrate numerically the evolution equations ( [ eq_12 ] ) taking @xmath28 and starting with initial profiles presented in the right panels of fig .",

    "conditions required on the amplitude of modulations and external pump field for the existence of localized patterns in the parametric oscillators have been deduced .",
