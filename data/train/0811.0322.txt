    "observationally it is well established that elliptical galaxies have dark matter halos , and also host central supermassive black holes .",
    "these empirical facts motivate the study of multi - component dynamical models .",
    "when studying dynamical models of stellar systems ( single or multi - component ) , the minimal requirement to be met by a physically acceptable model is the positivity of the phase - space distribution function ( df ) of each distinct component .",
    "a model satisfying this essential requirement ( which is much weaker than stability , but stronger than the fact that the jeans equations have a physically acceptable solution ) is called _ consistent _ ; moreover , when the total gravitational potential is determined by the total density profile through the poisson equation , the model is called _ self  consistent_. in other words , we call self  consistent a consistent self - gravitating system .",
    "two general strategies can be used to construct a ( self ) consistent model , or check whether a proposed model is ( self ) consistent : they are commonly referred to as the `` @xmath4to@xmath5 '' and the `` @xmath5to@xmath4 '' approaches , where @xmath4 is the model df ( e.g. , see bertin 2000 , binney & tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "an example of the first approach is the survey of self  consistent two ",
    "component galaxy models carried out by bertin and co  workers , where the stellar and dark matter components are described by two dfs of the @xmath6 family ( e.g. , bertin & stiavelli 1984 , bertin et al .",
    "1992 ) ; other well known examples are the king ( 1966 ) models and the @xmath7 models ( bertin & trenti 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting spatial densities obtained by solving the associated poisson equation are in general not expressible in terms of simple or even known functions , and so only numerical investigations are usually feasible . in the `` @xmath5to@xmath4 '' approach",
    "the density distribution is given , and specific assumptions about the model internal dynamics are made ; in special cases inversion formulae from the density to the df can be obtained , usually in integral form or series expansion ( see , e.g. , fricke 1952 , lynden ",
    "bell 1962 , osipkov 1979 , merritt 1985 , hereafter om ; dejonghe 1986 , 1987 ; cuddeford 1991 ; hunter & qian 1993 , ciotti & bertin 2005 ) .",
    "in particular , in order to recover the df of spherical models with orbital anisotropy , the om technique has been developed from the eddington ( 1916 ) inversion for isotropic systems , and widely used to study one and two  component models ( see , e.g. , ciotti & pellegrini 1992 , hereafter cp92 ; hiotelis 1994 ; carollo et al .",
    "1995 ; ciotti & lanzoni 1997 ; ciotti 1996 , 1999 , hereafter c96 , c99 ; baes & dejonghe 2004 ; buyle et al .",
    "we remark that the om parameterization is not necessarily the best description of real systems , however its simplicity and the fact that it captures the main features of models of galaxy formation , that are generally found nearly isotropic at the center and increasingly radially anisotropic in the outer envelope ( e.g. , van albada 1982 ; trenti , bertin & van albada 2005 ; nipoti , londrillo & ciotti 2006 ; binney & tremaine 2008 . but see cuesta et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) , make it the natural choice for investigations as that presented in this paper .    in many cases , the difficulties inherent in the operation of recovering analytically the df",
    "prevent a simple consistency analysis , and phase  space positivity must be investigated by numerical inspection of the inversion integral . in these cases",
    "the reasons underlying consistency or inconsistency of a proposed model tend to be obscured by the numerical nature of the solution .",
    "fortunately , informations about consistency of multi  component om systems can be obtained without recovering their df , following the procedure described in cp92 .",
    "this method uses the radial density profile of each component and the total potential of the system , and gives necessary and sufficient conditions for ( self ) consistency .",
    "moreover , since only spatial differentiation and inequality checks are required , this method is best suited for analytical investigations .",
    "for example , c96 and c99 applied the cp92 technique to the general family of two  component , spherically symmetric and radially anisotropic @xmath8 models .",
    "this family is made of the superposition of two @xmath1 models ( dehnen 1993 , tremaine et al . 1994 ) with different total masses , scale  lengths , inner density slopes , and om radially anisotropic velocity dispersions . the possibility to investigate the combined effects of radial anisotropy and inner density slope on multi  component systems made the study of @xmath8 models interesting , as it is well known that the inner density profile sets important constraints on the amount of admissible radial anisotropy ( e.g. , richstone & tremaine 1984 ) , and indeed in c96 and c99 analytical limitations on anisotropy as a function of the density slopes @xmath0 and @xmath9 were obtained .",
    "these models clarified the reasons behind the numerical findings of cp92 , i.e. the difficulty of consistently superimposing a centrally peaked distribution such as the de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) profile to a centrally flat one , such as the king ( 1972 ) or quasi  isothermal density profile ( even in the isotropic case ) .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the df of the @xmath0 component in isotropic @xmath8 models is nowhere negative , independently of the mass and concentration of the @xmath9 component , whenever @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "on the contrary , a @xmath12 component becomes inconsistent when adding a @xmath13 halo with a small core radius .",
    "thus , in two  component isotropic models , the component with the steeper central density distribution is usually the most robust against inconsistency .",
    "more recently , the importance of the central density slope in limiting the amount of possible radial anisotropy has also been quantified with the so called `` cusp slope - central anisotropy '' theorem ( an & evans 2006 , hereafter ae06 ; see also eq .  [",
    "28 ] in de bruijne et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the previous investigations left however unexplored the importance of the _ external _ density slope in determining the model consistency .",
    "in fact , the phase  space density can not be identified , in general , with any specific spatial position in the system , as ( for example ) stars of a given energy can span a large range of radial positions as a proxy for phase ",
    "space density , where @xmath14 is the local value of the velocity dispersion , has no assignable meaning without an appropriate discussion .",
    "for example , in power ",
    "law isotropic systems with @xmath15 , because the functions @xmath16 ( for @xmath17 ) and phase  space density @xmath18 ( for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the so  called relative energy , see sect .  4 and baes et al .",
    "2005 ) are both power laws with respect to their arguments , the exponents are related in a simple way . however , the converse statement is not true : for example , in the plummer ( 1911 ) sphere @xmath21 is a power law at all energies , but @xmath22 is not a power law of radius . ]",
    "( systems made of circular orbits are an obvious exception )",
    ". therefore also the external regions of a density distribution can be important in limiting the maximum allowable anisotropy , but the @xmath8 models are of no help in the study of this issue , because the external density profiles of both components all decrease as @xmath23 . for these reasons here we focus on the phase  space properties of models , i.e. models similar to the standard @xmath1 models in the inner regions , but with a density profile proportional to @xmath24 ( instead of @xmath23 ) in the external regions ; remarkably , several properties of models can be obtained from those of @xmath1 models by differentiation with respect to their scale  length . in this notation , the 4-@xmath1 models coincide with the standard @xmath1 models .",
    "we also study the larger class of ( @xmath25,@xmath0 ) models , i.e. two  component systems in which a @xmath0 halo is added to a component .",
    "thus , here we further explore the trends emerged in cp92 , c96 , and c99 , determining the limits imposed by phase ",
    "space consistency on the parameters describing ( , @xmath0 ) models , and models with a central bh [ hereafter ( , bh ) models ] , with particular focus on the effects of the external slope parameter @xmath2 . in specific cases",
    "( that we call _ halo - dominated _ models ) , the calculations are performed under the assumption that the mass of the halo component ( or of the central bh ) is dominant over the mass of the visible one .",
    "this assumption is mainly motivated by mathematical simplicity ( see also sect .  4 ) , although this is not the only reason .",
    "in fact , for any given two  component model , it is expected that the df properties are bracketed by those of the one component model and by those of the halo - dominated model ( corresponding to the formal case of an infinite halo mass ) . of course ,",
    "while the case of dark matter dominated systems can be considered a viable representation of some real astrophysical systems , the case of a dominant bh is less natural , and it just gives the strongest possible limitations for consistency of systems with a central bh .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the technique developed in cp92 , and we prove that the necessary condition for consistency derived in cp92 for om systems can be rewritten _",
    "exactly _ as the ae06 `` cusp slope - central anisotropy '' theorem , holding however at all radii and not just at the center . in section 3",
    "the one and two  component models are introduced , and the necessary and sufficient conditions imposed on the model parameters by phase  space consistency are derived for different values of the logarithmic density slope @xmath2 . in section 4 the df of the component of",
    "halo - dominated ( @xmath25,1 ) models with @xmath3 , and of similar models with a dominant central bh , are derived explicitly for arbitrary ( but integer ) values of @xmath2 , and the true boundaries of the consistency region in the parameter space are obtained .",
    "the main results of the investigation are summarized in section 5 .",
    "finally , in the appendix an easy method to solve analytically the jeans equations in the general om case for the wider class of ( @xmath26-@xmath0,@xmath27-@xmath9 ) models is presented .",
    "a stellar system made of the sum of the density components @xmath28 is called consistent if each df ( @xmath29 ) is non  negative over the whole accessible phase  space ; a consistent self  gravitating system is called self  consistent .",
    "the technique developed in cp92 permits us to check whether the df of a multi  component spherical system , where the orbital anisotropy of each component is modeled according to the om parameterization , is positive ; in practice , only information about the radial trend of each density component and of the total integrated mass are used . in the om formulation the df of each component is obtained assuming @xmath30 , with @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respectively the relative energy and the angular momentum modulus per unit mass , @xmath34 is the so  called _ anisotropy radius _ , and @xmath35 for @xmath36 ( e.g. see binney & tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion tensor associated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) is characterized by radial anisotropy increasing with the radius @xmath37 , while in the limit @xmath38 the system becomes globally isotropic .",
    "as well known , the df of the density component @xmath28 is given by @xmath39 where the _ augmented density _ is @xmath40 @xmath41 is the total relative potential , @xmath42 , and in the integrals above it is assumed that the radius is eliminated from @xmath43 in favour of @xmath44 .",
    "it can be proved that the second equivalence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fom ] ) holds for untruncated systems with finite total mass , as the models discussed here .",
    "quite obviously , only a very limited number of density profiles among those expressible in analytic form admit an explicit df , so that the study of phase  space consistency would appear restricted to such rare cases when conducted analytically , while all the remaining cases should be investigated numerically .",
    "fortunately this is not true , as the cp92 technique is based on the verification ( numerical or analytical ) of the following : a _ necessary condition _ ( nc ) for the non  negativity of @xmath29 is @xmath45 if the nc is satisfied , a _ strong sufficient condition _ ( ssc ) for the non  negativity of @xmath29 is @xmath46\\geq 0 , \\quad 0\\leq r\\leq\\infty .\\ ] ] finally , a _ weak sufficient condition _ ( wsc ) for the non negativity of @xmath29 is @xmath47\\geq 0 , \\quad 0\\leq r\\leq\\infty .\\ ] ] : see cp92 , c96 , c99 .",
    "the first consideration that follows from the conditions above is that the violation of the nc is connected only to the radial behavior of the augmented density @xmath43 , and so this condition applies independently of any other density component of the model .",
    "obviously , a model failing the nc is _ certainly inconsistent _ , while a model satisfying the nc _ may be inconsistent _ , i.e. the @xmath29 may be negative even for values of model parameters allowed by the nc .",
    "the second consideration is that a model satisfying the wsc ( or the more restrictive ssc ) is _ certainly consistent _ , while a model failing the wsc ( ssc ) _ may be consistent_. therefore the consistency of an om model satisfying the nc and failing the wsc ( or the ssc ) can be proved only by direct inspection of its df .      the nc can be recast into a simple inequality between the value of the density slope @xmath48 and the value of the orbital anisotropy indicator @xmath49 that must hold at each radius for consistent om systems . in the expression above @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the radial and tangential components of the velocity dispersion tensor of the system ( e.g. binney & tremaine 2008 ) , and in the following proof we restrict to natural systems , i.e. systems with monotonically decreasing density profile , so that @xmath52 .",
    "the proof is trivial : in fact , it suffices to express the nc in terms of the logarithmic density slope as @xmath53 and from eq .",
    "( [ betaom ] ) one obtains the necessary condition @xmath54 which must be verified by each om component of a consistent multi ",
    "component system .",
    "curiously , the condition above is formally _ identical _ to the inequality appearing in the `` cusp slope - central anisotropy '' theorem derived in ae06 .",
    "this latter theorem was proved by using constant anisotropy systems ( i.e. , @xmath55 , and in this case as well the inequality above holds at all radii in consistent models .",
    "[ 10 ] in ae06 ) , and then it was convincingly argued that the inequality it holds asymptotically for the central regions of spherical systems with generic anisotropy distribution .    in the specific case of density distributions (",
    "[ [ eq : ng ] ] ) , the logarithmic density slope @xmath56 and therefore eq .  ( [ cuspslope ] ) shows that in general the nc is satisfied near the center of om systems ( where @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , and at large radii ( where @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , while critical behaviors may be expected at intermediate radii ( see sect .  4 ) .",
    "interestingly ( but not unexpectedly ) the particular functional form of the augmented density characteristic of om parametrization , limits the possible manifestations of phase  space inconsistency to few general cases , that can be illustrated as follows . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fom])-([eq : rhoom ] ) it is apparent that the df of each density component can be written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the df of the considered density component in the isotropic case ( for simplicity , from now on we avoid the use of the subscript @xmath63 ) .",
    "let @xmath64 be the subset of phase  space defined by the property that @xmath62 is positive @xmath65 .",

    "identical _ considerations hold when discussing the inequalities ( [ eq : nc ] ) and ( [ eq : wsc ] ) , because from eq .",

    "the one  component models are a natural generalization of the widely explored family of the so  called @xmath1 models ( dehnen 1993 , tremaine et al . 1994 ) , whose density , cumulative mass within @xmath37 , and relative potential are given by @xmath78 @xmath79}\\cr                  \\displaystyle{\\ln\\frac{r+\\rc}{r}},\\quad(\\gamma=2),\\cr           \\end{cases}\\ ] ] respectively .    in the models the logarithmic density slope for @xmath80 is not 4 , but it is a free parameter @xmath81 ( to ensure that their total mass is finite ) , so that these density profiles belong to the family considered by zhao ( 1996 ) . in the following , in order to exploit a useful analytical property of the density profiles , we will often assume @xmath2 restricted to integer values @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , the generic density profile of a model is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the total mass of the density distribution , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the complete euler beta and gamma functions , respectively , and the first expression holds for any real number @xmath81 .",
    "the second expression , based on repeated differentiation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhog ] ) with respect to @xmath87 , holds instead for integer @xmath88 . of course , for @xmath89 the standard @xmath1 model density profile is recovered .",

    "we show the corresponding logarithmic density slopes , calculated accordingly to eq .",
    "( [ gammarhong ] ) .",
    "in particular , it is apparent how the inner slope is @xmath1 ( for @xmath91 ) , and the external is @xmath2 ( for @xmath92 ) . as a consequence , while the density profile outside @xmath87 becomes more and more steep at increasing @xmath2 , the innermost region where the density slope is @xmath1 contracts near the center .     of the @xmath2 - 1 model ( top panel ) , and its logarithmic slope ( eq .  [ [ gammarhong ] ] , bottom panel ) , for @xmath93 , and @xmath94.,scaledwidth=52.0% ]    as anticipated , the possibility to write the density @xmath95 as a derivative with respect to the scale ",
    "length @xmath87 provides an easy way to determine analytical properties of the models for @xmath2 integer .",
    "indeed , since the density enters linearly in the integrals of the total mass inside the radius @xmath37 and of the potential , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ng ] ) it follows that @xmath96 instead , when @xmath2 is not at integer , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are in general given by hypergeometric @xmath99 functions .",
    "expressions similar to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mng])-([eq : phing ] ) hold for any quantity that can be written as a linear functional of @xmath95 , so that the surface density profile of models with @xmath2 integer can be obtained by repeated differentiation of the surface density profile of @xmath1 models ( when analytically available , e.g. see binney & merrifield 1998 ) . this property will be exploited in section 4 to obtain the explicit df of halo dominated ( , @xmath0 ) models ; moreover , in appendix b we show how quadratic functionals of @xmath95 ( such as the gravitational energy and the velocity dispersions ) can be also evaluated by using repeated differentiation with respect to @xmath87 .",
    "we are now in the position to introduce the two  component models used in this work .",
    "the most general family of two  component models , i.e. the ( @xmath26-@xmath0,@xmath27-@xmath9 ) models , is made of the superposition of two models with different total masses , scale  lengths , internal and external density slopes , and finally two different anisotropy radii . for simplicity here we restrict to the case of ( , @xmath0 ) models , where the `` halo '' density distribution is a standard @xmath0 model : we note however that some of the presented results can be generalized without much effort to the family of ( @xmath26-@xmath0,@xmath27-@xmath9 ) models ( see appendix b ) . in the following , the total mass @xmath100 and the characteristic scale ",
    "length @xmath101 of the @xmath0 halo are adopted as normalization constants , so that the physical scales for density and potential are given by @xmath102 and @xmath103 , while we define @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 . with this choice , the ( , @xmath0 )",
    "models are structurally determined by fixing the four independent parameters @xmath107 , with the obvious conditions @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we conclude this introductory discussion by noticing that , for reasons that will become apparent in section 3.2 and 4 , the present normalization differs from that adopted in c99 , where the normalization mass and scale  length were those of the first component .      before discussing the case of the two  component models , we consider the nc for anisotropic models , in order to determine analytically a critical value for the anisotropy radius such that a higher degree of radial om anisotropy ( i.e. , a smaller @xmath110 ) would produce a negative df for some permitted value of @xmath111 .",
    "we recall that the obtained anisotropy limit holds also when a second component is added ( see section 2 ) , so that the present discussion is fully general .",
    "moreover , we note that as the nc involves only the density distribution under scrutiny , we can use the first expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ng ] ) , and the following results hold for any @xmath81 , not necessarily limited to integers . in the following the unit mass and unit length are the total mass @xmath84 and the scale  length @xmath87 of the model , with @xmath112 .    in c99 the analytical expression for the critical @xmath113 was obtained for the whole family of @xmath1-models , and here we derive its generalization @xmath114 .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( a1 ) shows that for @xmath115 and @xmath81 the nc is satisfied for @xmath116 , and the result of c99 is now obtained as the particular case for @xmath89 . in other words ,",
    "the nc leaves open the possibility of making models with @xmath117 using radial orbits only . in the range",
    "@xmath118 the nc requires instead that @xmath119 where the explicit expression of @xmath120 is given by eq .",
    "( a2 ) , and the inequality above reduces to eq .  ( 13 ) of c99 when @xmath89 .",
    "the nc then proves that models with @xmath118 can not be made of radial orbits only , independently of the value of the external slope @xmath2 , and of the presence of any possible second component .",
    "this result extends the list of cases for which it has been proved that a density cusp shallower than @xmath121 can not be supported by radial orbits only ( richstone & tremaine 1984 , cp92 , c99 , ae06 ) .     as a function of @xmath1 in one  component models , for @xmath122 .",

    "in particular , for fixed @xmath1 an increase of @xmath2 produces a decrease of the minimum @xmath123 , i.e. we have here a first indication that a steepening of the density profile in the external regions of a system with fixed inner density slope can be effective in increasing the maximum amount of sustainable radial anisotropy .",
    "this behaviour is quantified by substitution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ngnc ] ) of the asymptotic expansion for @xmath125 of @xmath120 in eq .",

    "we now move to discuss the wsc for one  component models : the obtained @xmath128 will mark a lower limit above which consistency ( for the considered @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) is guaranteed . unfortunately , the wsc can not be explored algebraically in the general case , because the resulting inequality ( that for simplicity we do not report here ) involves the solution of an equation of fifth degree for @xmath129 , and the degree increases for increasing @xmath2 . for @xmath89 , instead",
    ", it is possible to treat the wsc analytically , since it reduces to the discussion of a cubic equation ( see c99 ) .",
    "of course , the critical values for the anisotropy radius can be easily obtained solving numerically inequality ( [ eq : wsc ] ) in any specific case of interest , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] for @xmath122 with dashed lines : all one  component models with the pair ( @xmath123,@xmath1 ) in the region above the dashed lines are consistent .",
    "note how for increasing values of the external density slope @xmath2 more and more radially anisotropic orbital distributions can be supported , thus confirming the indications provided by the nc .",
    "values of @xmath123 nearer to the limits set by the df are obtained by using the ssc .",
    "inequality ( [ eq : ssc ] ) evaluated for a generic pair ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) results in a transcendental equation that must be studied numerically ( as already done for @xmath89 in c99 ) , and the black dots joined by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] represent the critical lower values of @xmath123 for one  component @xmath1 models with @xmath3 , and @xmath122 .",
    "as expected , the dotted lines are contained between the solid ( nc ) and the dashed ( wsc ) lines in each panel , and again they shift downward for increasing @xmath2 .",
    "thus , from this preliminary investigation of one  component models we conclude that for fixed @xmath1 an increase of @xmath2 corresponds to a decrease of the minimum admissible value of @xmath123 , i.e. _ steeper density distributions in the external regions can support more radial anisotropy_.      in order to proceed further with the preliminary discussion , we now apply the wsc to the component of a ( , @xmath0 ) model , extending to this class of systems some of the results obtained in c96 and c99 for two ",

    "in particular , the analytical study in c99 was restricted to some representative @xmath8 models , namely @xmath130 isotropic two - component systems with inner slopes in the ranges @xmath131 , and @xmath10 ( i.e. the @xmath9 component is shallower in the central regions ) ; @xmath132 isotropic two  component ( 0,1 ) systems ( i.e. the @xmath9 component is steeper in the central regions ) ; and finally @xmath133 anisotropic @xmath0 profiles with @xmath131 in the gravitational field of a dominant central black hole . here , in order to obtain analytical results for the more general ( @xmath25,@xmath0 ) models , we assume that the @xmath0 component ( the `` halo '' ) dominates everywhere the gravitational field . under this simplifying assumption , the following three results , corresponding to the points @xmath130 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 above , will be proved analytically :    1 .   in the case of halo  dominated _ isotropic _ ( , @xmath0 ) models , with @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath81 , the centrally more peaked component is consistent , independently of the value @xmath136 of its concentration relative to the centrally flatter @xmath0 halo . in the case of _ anisotropic _ ( , @xmath0 ) models , the determination of a minimum anisotropy radius for consistency as a function of @xmath2,@xmath1,@xmath0,@xmath137 reduces to the solution of an algebraic equation of sixth degree ( for generic @xmath2 ) , which is solved numerically . in the particular case of halo  dominated ( @xmath2 - 2,1 ) models , the application of the wsc shows that for @xmath138 these models can be consistently assembled using radial orbits only . 2 .   in the case of halo",
    " dominated _ isotropic _ ( @xmath2 - 0,1 ) models , the wsc shows that for @xmath139 the @xmath2 - 0 density distribution is consistent . for broader @xmath2 - 0 density distributions ,",
    "the models can be consistent only in presence of some amount of radial anisotropy .",
    "3 .   in the case of _ anisotropic _ @xmath25 models with a dominant black hole at their center it is possible to determine analytically a lower limit @xmath140 for consistency , and this limit decreases for increasing @xmath2 .    ) as a function of the relative concentration @xmath137 , for consistency of halo dominated ( @xmath25,1 ) models .",
    "the external density slope @xmath2 increases as @xmath93 , and @xmath94 from left to right panels , while the internal density slope as @xmath141 , and @xmath142 from top to bottom panels .",
    "solid lines represent the limits derived from the wsc , while dashed lines are the @xmath143 derived from the df .",

[ a3 ] ) .",
    "in particular , as this result holds also for @xmath81 , while the external logarithmic slope of the @xmath0 halo is @xmath146 , it means that a centrally steep density profile can be consistent in the gravitational field of a more massive ( but centrally shallower ) component , even when its external regions are less peaked .",

    "a few additional trends are apparent .",
    "first , for a given central logarithmic density slope @xmath1 and for a given relative concentration @xmath137 , an increase of @xmath2 corresponds to a better and better ability to sustain radial anisotropy , and thus the trend found in one  component models is confirmed also in the two  component case .",
    "second , at fixed @xmath2 and @xmath1 , the minimum anisotropy radius for consistency increases for increasing @xmath137 .",
    "this trend was already found in c96 and c99 : in practice , in a fixed potential broader density distributions are less and less able to sustain radial anisotropy .",
    "third , at fixed external slope @xmath2 and relative concentration @xmath137 , more centrally peaked systems are better able to support radial anisotropy .",
    "an additional comment concerns the specific case of ( @xmath2 - 2,1 ) models ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , bottom panels ) .",
    "in fact , it is apparent how in presence of a dominant @xmath148 halo the wsc limits flatten to zero for relative concentration less than some critical value @xmath149 , and accordingly the model may be purely radially anisotropic . remarkably , it is easy to show that the @xmath2 - 2 component can support purely radial orbits for relative concentrations @xmath150 ( see eq .  [ a4 ] ) , which are exactly the critical points in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . of course",
    ", this is just a sufficient condition , so we expect that the existence of a larger critical concentration for consistency in case of purely radial orbits will be revealed by direct inspection of the df .",
    "a final comment is due .",
    "in fact , the adopted range of values for the internal density slopes @xmath151 imply that the halo density distribution is centrally less peaked than the @xmath152 component . therefore , for large but _ finite _ total halo mass",
    ", the integrated mass of the halo is subdominant with respect to the stellar one for vanishing @xmath37 , and the assumption of a dominant halo breaks down at the very center .",
    "this means that in an asymptotic sense , the analysis presented in the previous section should be applied at the center of these finite - halo mass models .",

    "the obtained limitation @xmath153 , shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , suggests that the concentration of the @xmath154 component must `` adapt '' to the dominant @xmath148 halo for phase  space consistency .",
    "note that @xmath149 increases for increasing @xmath2 , i.e. a steeper external density profile can ( partially ) compensate for the effect of a central shallower density distribution .",
    "the appearence of the concentration limit @xmath149 in the isotropic case manifests in the top panels of fig .",
    "in fact , as discussed in section 2 , in systems with positive isotropic functions ( wsc or df ) only a lower limit for @xmath123 exists , as in the case of halo dominated ( @xmath2 - 1,1 ) and ( @xmath2 - 2,1 ) models . in the present case , instead , when for increasing @xmath137 the critical value @xmath155 is crossed ( in the @xmath89 panel )",
    ", the additional condition @xmath156 corresponding to the radial domain @xmath69 appears as the vertical asymptote of the solid line , and the parameter space for consistency progressively reduces , shrinking to zero for the value of @xmath137 where the two solid lines ( obtained numerically ) cross . a similar configuration repeats in the panels representing the @xmath129 and @xmath157 cases , where the consistency limits move , as expected , downward and rightward .",
    "of course , these limits represent only a sufficient condition for the consistency , and when considering the df in the limit @xmath158 ( see section 4 ) we expect to determine larger critical values of @xmath149 , and larger consistency regions in the ( @xmath137,@xmath123 ) plane .",
    "the result concerning the models with central black hole , related to point @xmath133 above , is proved as follows .",
    "as well known , for @xmath159 the potential of the @xmath148 model becomes that of a point mass , and from the first result proven in this section it follows that a black hole of any mass @xmath160 can be consistently added at the center of a globally isotropic model , when @xmath161 and @xmath81 .",
    "for this reason in the following we restrict to this range of slopes @xmath1 , and accordingly the long  dashed curves in fig .",

    "@xmath2 makes it possible to sustain more radial orbits .",
    "it should be clear that the df of two  component ( , @xmath0 ) models can not be obtained analytically , except for very special combinations of the values of @xmath168 and @xmath0 , as for example the ( 1,1 ) models discussed in c96 ( that would be referred as ( @xmath146-@xmath169,@xmath169 ) models in the present notation ) .",
    "however , the search is not hopeless .",
    "in fact , from c99 it is known that the halo dominated df of two  component ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) galaxy models can be obtained in terms of elementary functions , and a simple argument shows that this is also the case of ( 2,1 ) and ( 2,0 ) models .",

    "expressible using elementary functions  can be studied very easily , making apparent the effects of the relative distribution of the investigated component and of the halo . in particular , in this section we will determine the df of the component of halo dominated ( , 1 ) models , and the exact phase ",
    "space constraints will be derived and compared with those obtained using the nc , wsc , and ssc in section 3 .",
    "we restrict to the @xmath148 case because the hernquist ( 1990 ) potential is the simplest in the class of @xmath1 models ; furthermore , this choice allows us to investigate the consistency of models with central density slopes flatter ( @xmath154 ) , equal ( @xmath127 ) , and steeper ( @xmath170 ) than that of the halo . as a consequence",

    "in other words , the dominant density distribution sets the natural scales . the easiest way to compute the df is to change the integration variable from the total potential to the radius in the first of the identities in eq .",

    "then , for @xmath137 greater than the critical limit , a range of concentrations exists where an anisotropy radius @xmath243 corresponds to consistent models ; finally , for @xmath137 larger than the value where the dotted ( @xmath144 ) and dashed ( @xmath143 ) lines cross each other , @xmath244 , and the models become inconsistent . summarizing , consistent models correspond to points placed above the @xmath143 line and on the left of the @xmath144 line .    in the case of a central dominant black hole , the same comments as those for ( @xmath2 - 2,bh ) and ( @xmath2 - 1,bh )",
    "models apply , and the functions @xmath231 and @xmath191 are obtained accordingly . of course ,",
    "the isotropic model is inconsistent , independently of the values of @xmath2 , because the model with black hole would correspond to the formal limit @xmath245 in ( @xmath2 - 0,1 ) models , which is already excluded by the previous discussion .",
    "what happens when considering the effect of anisotropy ?",
    "is there any compensating effect ?",
    "a numerical inspection shows that the anisotropic part of the df is negative on @xmath69 , so that not even orbital anisotropy can make the models consistent .",
    "again , this result was expected from the study of ( @xmath2 - 0,1 ) models , due to the crossing of the @xmath143 and @xmath144 critical lines at finite values of @xmath137 .",
    "in this paper , in a natural extension of previous investigations ( cp92 , c96 , c99 ) , we focused on the importance of the _ external _ density logarithmic slope on the determination of the phase  space consistency of one and two  component stellar systems with om orbital anisotropy .",
    "in particular , the considered ( @xmath25,@xmath0 ) models generalize ( @xmath0,@xmath9 ) models , as the density component is characterized by logarithmic slope @xmath2 instead of @xmath146 outside the core radius , while in the inner regions the logarithmic density slope is @xmath1 .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "it is shown that , for @xmath2 integer , several structural and dynamical properties of the models can be obtained by differentiation , with respect to the scale  length , of the corresponding formulae valid for the standard @xmath1 models . for example , it is shown how to construct explicit solutions of the jeans equations for the class of two  component anisotropic ( @xmath26-@xmath0,@xmath27-@xmath9 ) models once the solution is known for ( @xmath0,@xmath9 ) models . 2 .   in one - component models , a lower limit for the anisotropy radius ,",
    "so that smaller values certainly produce inconsistent models , is analytically derived following the technique introduced in cp92 .",
    "it is found that for @xmath246 this minimum anisotropy radius is strictly positive , but it decreases by increasing @xmath2 , i.e. a larger amount of radial anisotropy can be supported by externally steeper density profiles . for @xmath247 instead",
    "the necessary condition for consistency is satisfied @xmath248 , independently of the value of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the minimum anisotropy radius so that larger values correspond to consistent models",
    "is then determined by using the strong and weak sufficient conditions for model consistency derived in cp92 . as for the necessary condition",
    ", we find that the minimum value of the anisotropy radius decreases for increasing @xmath1 and fixed @xmath2 , and for increasing @xmath2 and fixed @xmath1 .",
    "3 .   a similar analysis",
    "is then performed for two - component ( @xmath25,@xmath0 ) systems , in order to extend the study of c99 . for simplicity",
    "we restrict to halo dominated models , i.e. we take into account only the gravitational field of the @xmath0 halo .",
    "in particular , we show that in the isotropic case , when @xmath161 and @xmath135 ( i.e. , the halo density is centrally less peaked than the stellar component ) , the df of the component is nowhere negative , independently of the mass and concentration of the @xmath0 halo .",
    "this is true even when in the external parts the component is less peaked @xmath249 than the @xmath0 component . as a special application of this result",
    ", it follows that a black hole of any mass can be consistently added at the center of a globally isotropic model , when @xmath250 .",
    "moreover , in the case of ( @xmath2 - 0,1 ) models , where instead the halo is centrally steeper than the stellar component , the sufficient condition applied to the @xmath2 - 0 density distribution reveals the existence of an upper limit @xmath251 of the relative concentration @xmath241 for model consistency in the isotropic case .",
    "finally , in the case of anisotropic models with a dominant black hole at their center , we determined analytically a lower limit of the critical anisotropy radius for consistency as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath1 ; this value decreases for increasing @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 .",
    "4 .   the analytic expression for the df of om anisotropic halo dominated ( @xmath25,1 ) models , and (",
    ", bh ) models with a dominant central bh is recovered in terms of elementary functions in the special cases when @xmath252 .",
    "it is found that , while for @xmath253 the isotropic df is positive independently of the model concentration , the @xmath154 component becomes inconsistent when the halo is sufficiently concentrated , even in the isotropic case .",
    "in addition , the trend of the minimum value of the anisotropy radius as a function of the halo concentration confirms that steeper density profiles in the external region are consistent with a larger amount of radial anisotropy .    in conclusion , the explored family of models provide a direct indication that the density slope in the external regions of stellar systems can be important in determining the admissible radial anisotropy , and this in addition to the well known relevance of the central density slope .",
    "a quantification of this argument is embodied in a _ necessary _ inequality for model consistency , that we derived by expressing a previous finding ( cp92 ) in terms of the logarithmic density slope .",
    "the obtained result holds for _ all _ consistent om anisotropic systems , and relates the logarithmic density slope and the om anisotropy indicator at _ each radius _ , in a way formally identical to the `` cusp slope - central anisotropy '' theorem by ae06 , which is known to apply at the center of stellar systems with generic anisotropy distribution , and everywhere in constant anisotropy systems .",
    "we wish to thank the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions that greatly improved the presentation of the paper .",
    "simple algebra shows that the nc applied to anisotropic models can be written as @xmath254 for @xmath255 and @xmath256 the r.h.s .",
    "is everywhere negative , so that inequality ( a1 ) is trivially satisfied for @xmath257 . instead ,",
    "for @xmath246 the parameter @xmath123 must be larger than the maximum of the expression of the r.h.s .",

    "the discussion of the wsc for globally isotropic @xmath2 - 0 models in a dominant @xmath127 halo is simple , reducing to the request that @xmath271 which is satisfied for @xmath153 . for @xmath89",

    "the method is based on the evaluation of the similar quantities for the two  components @xmath8 models , and then on repeated differentiation with respect to the scale  lengths .",
    "we start by considering the radial component @xmath50 of the velocity dispersion @xmath283 of a system with a density component @xmath5 , which in the om parameterization can be written as @xmath284 where @xmath285 ( binney & mamon 1982 ) , and @xmath286 is the total mass within @xmath37 .",
    "once @xmath50 is known , the tangential velocity dispersion is obtained from eq .",
