    "a _ frame _ over a hilbert space @xmath2 is a collection of vectors @xmath3 with _ frame bounds _",
    "@xmath4 such that @xmath5 for a finite frame @xmath6 in an @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space @xmath7 , the upper frame bound @xmath8 which satisfies trivially exists . in this finite - dimensional",
    "setting , the notion of being a frame solely depends on the lower frame bound @xmath9 being strictly positive , which is equivalent to having the frame elements @xmath6 span the hilbert space .    in practice ,",
    "frames are chiefly used in two ways .",
    "the _ synthesis operator _ @xmath10 of a finite frame @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12f_n$ ] . as such",
    ", the @xmath13 matrix representation @xmath14 of the synthesis operator has the frame elements @xmath6 as columns , with the natural identification @xmath15 .",
    "note that here and throughout , we make no notational distinction between a frame @xmath14 and its synthesis operator .",
    "the adjoint of the synthesis operator is called the _ analysis operator _",
    "@xmath16 , defined by @xmath17:=\\langle x , f_n\\rangle$ ] .",
    "classically , frames are used to redundantly decompose signals , @xmath18 , before synthesizing the corresponding frame coefficients , @xmath19 , and so the _ frame operator _ @xmath20 is often analyzed to determine how well this process preserves information about the original signal @xmath21 . in particular , if the frame bounds are equal , the frame operator has the form @xmath22 , and so signal reconstruction is rather painless : @xmath23 ; in this case , the frame is called _ tight_. oftentimes ,",
    "it is additionally desirable for the frame elements to have unit norm , in which case the frame is a _ unit norm frame_. moreover , the _ worst - case coherence _ between unit norm frame elements @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 , and equality is achieved precisely when the frame is tight with @xmath26 for all distinct pairs @xmath27",
    "@xcite ; in this case , the frame is called an _ equiangular tight frame _ ( etf ) .",
    "the utility of unit norm tight frames and etfs is commonly expressed in terms of a scenario in which frame coefficients @xmath28\\}_{n=1}^n$ ] are transmitted over a noisy or lossy channel before reconstructing the signal : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the channel s random and not - necessarily - linear deformation process . using an additive white gaussian noise model ,",
    "goyal  @xcite established that , of all unit norm frames , unit norm tight frames minimize mean squared error in reconstruction . for the case of a lossy channel , holmes and paulsen",
    "@xcite established that , of all tight frames , unit norm tight frames minimize worst - case error in reconstruction after one erasure , and that equiangular tight frames minimize this error after two erasures .",
    "we note that the reconstruction process in , namely the application of @xmath31 , is inherently blind to the effect of the deformation process of the channel .",
    "this contrasts with pschel and kovaevi s more recent work  @xcite , which describes an adaptive process for reconstruction after multiple erasures ; we will return to this idea later .",
    "another application of frames is sparse signal processing .",
    "this field concerns signal classes which are sparse in some basis . as an example",
    ", natural images tend to be nearly sparse in the wavelet basis  @xcite .",
    "some applications have signal sparsity in the identity basis  @xcite . given a signal @xmath21 , let @xmath32 represent its sparsifying basis and consider @xmath33 where @xmath14 is the @xmath13 synthesis operator of a frame , @xmath34 has at most @xmath35 nonzero entries , and @xmath36 is some sort of noise .",
    "when given measurements @xmath37 , one typically wishes to reconstruct the original vector @xmath21 ; viewing @xmath14 as a sensing matrix , this process is commonly referred to as _ compressed sensing _ since we often take @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath37 can be viewed as a noisy linear combination of a few unknown frame elements , and the goal of compressed sensing is to determine which frame elements are active in the combination , and further estimate the scalar multiples used in this combination .",
    "this problem setup is very related to that of sparse approximation , in which signals are known to be expressible as a sparse combination of elements from an _ overcomplete _ dictionary ; in this case , the dictionary elements form the columns of @xmath14 , and we again wish to determine the scalar multiples used in a given sparse combination .    in order to have any sort of inversion process for , even in the noiseless case where @xmath39 , @xmath14 must map @xmath35-sparse vectors injectively .",
    "that is , we need @xmath40 for any distinct @xmath35-sparse vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "subtraction then gives that @xmath43-sparse vectors like @xmath44 can not be in the nullspace of @xmath14 .",
    "this identification led to the following definition  @xcite :    the _ spark _ of a matrix @xmath14 is the size of the smallest linearly dependent subset of columns , i.e. , @xmath45    using the above analysis , donoho and elad  @xcite showed that a signal @xmath21 with sparsity level @xmath46 is necessarily the unique sparsest solution to @xmath47 , and furthermore , there exist signals @xmath21 of sparsity level @xmath48 which are not the unique sparsest solution to @xmath47 .",
    "this demonstrates that matrices with larger spark are naturally equipped to support signals with larger sparsity levels .",
    "one is naturally led to consider matrices that support the largest possible sparse signal class ; we say an @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 is _ full spark _ if its spark is as large as possible , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath13 full spark matrices have the property that every @xmath50 submatrix is invertible ; as such , a full spark matrix is necessarily full rank , and therefore a frame .",
    "that being said , while the submatrices of a full spark matrix will be invertible , they may not be well - conditioned",
    ". moreover , the conditioning of these submatrices is an important feature for compressed sensing ; cands  @xcite gives an elegant proof that sensing matrices with well - conditioned submatrices , specifically , satisfying the _ restricted isometry property ( rip ) _ , allow for stable and efficient recovery .",
    "unfortunately , for deterministic matrices , it is difficult to determine the conditioning of every submatrix ; to date , no deterministic rip matrix is known to perform optimally  @xcite , and in one respect , this difficulty is precisely the barrier to significant progress on the kadison - singer problem  @xcite .",
    "however , some work has been done to test whether _ most _ submatrices are well - conditioned  @xcite , and better yet , other work has managed to achieve rip - like performance without requiring all submatrices to be well - conditioned  @xcite .",
    "regardless , good sensing matrices for compressed sensing must necessarily have large spark to enable reconstruction  @xcite , and so building such matrices could serve as one step toward optimal deterministic rip matrices .    in sparse signal processing , the specific application of full spark frames has been studied for some time . in 1997 ,",
    "gorodnitsky and rao  @xcite first considered full spark frames , referring to them as matrices with the _ unique representation property _",
    "( for reasons discussed above ) .",
    "since  @xcite , the unique representation property has been explicitly used to find a variety of performance guarantees for sparse signal processing  @xcite .",
    "tang and nehorai  @xcite also obtain performance guarantees using full spark frames , but they refer to them as _ non - degenerate measurement matrices_.    consider a matrix whose entries are independent continuous random variables .",
    "intuitively , the matrix is full spark with probability one , and this fact was recently proved in  @xcite .",
    "however , this random process does not allow one to control certain features of the matrix , such as unit - norm tightness or equiangularity .",
    "indeed , etfs are notoriously difficult to construct , but they appear to be particularly well - suited for sparse signal processing  @xcite .",
    "for example , bajwa et al .",
    "@xcite uses steiner etfs to recover the support of @xmath34 in ; given measurements @xmath37 , the largest entries in the back - projection @xmath51 often coincide with the support of @xmath34 . however , steiner etfs have particularly small spark  @xcite , and back - projection will correctly identify the support of @xmath21 even when the corresponding columns in @xmath14 are dependent ; in this case , there is no way to estimate the nonzero entries of @xmath34 .",
    "this illustrates one reason to build deterministic full spark frames : their submatrices are necessarily invertible , making it possible to estimate these nonzero entries .    for another application of full spark frames , we return to the problem of reconstructing a signal from distorted frame coefficients .",
    "specifically , we consider pschel and kovaevi s work  @xcite , which focuses on an internet - like channel that is prone to multitudes of erasures . in this context , they reconstruct the signal after first identifying which frame coefficients were not erased ; with this information , the signal can be estimated provided the corresponding frame elements span . in this sense ,",
    "full spark frames are _ maximally robust to erasures _ , as coined in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , an @xmath13 full spark frame is robust to @xmath52 erasures since any @xmath0 of the frame coefficients will uniquely determine the original signal .",
    "yet another application of full spark frames is phaseless reconstruction , which can be viewed in terms of a channel , as in ; in this case , @xmath30 is the entrywise absolute value function .",
    "phaseless reconstruction has a number of real - world applications including speech processing  @xcite , x - ray crystallography  @xcite , and quantum state estimation  @xcite .",
    "as such , there has been a lot of work to reconstruct an @xmath0-dimensional vector ( up to an overall phase factor ) from the magnitudes of its frame coefficients , most of which involves frames in operator space , which inherently require @xmath53 measurements  @xcite",
    ". however , balan et al .",
    "@xcite show that if an @xmath13 real frame @xmath14 is full spark with @xmath54 , then @xmath55 is injective , meaning an inversion process is possible with only @xmath56 measurements .",
    "this result prompted an ongoing search for efficient phaseless reconstruction processes  @xcite , but no reconstruction process can succeed without a good family of frames , such as full spark frames .    despite the fact that full spark frames have a multitude of applications , to date",
    ", there has not been much progress in constructing deterministic full spark frames , let alone full spark frames with additional desirable properties .",
    "a noteworthy exception is pschel and kovaevi s work  @xcite , in which real full spark tight frames are constructed using polynomial transforms . in the present paper , we start by investigating vandermonde frames , harmonic frames , and modifications thereof . while the use of certain vandermonde and harmonic frames as full spark frames is not new  @xcite , the fruits of our investigation are new : for instance , we demonstrate that certain classes of etfs are full spark , and we characterize the @xmath13 full spark harmonic frames for which @xmath57 is a prime power .",
    "the remainder of the paper proves two results which might be considered folklore - type observations  while their proofs are new , the results are not surprising .",
    "first , in section  3 , we show that @xmath13 full spark parseval frames form a dense subset of the entire collection of @xmath13 parseval frames . as such",
    ", full spark frames are abundant , even after imposing the additional condition of tightness . this result is balanced with section  4 ,",
    "in which we prove that verifying whether a matrix is full spark is hard for @xmath1 under randomized polynomial - time reductions .",
    "in other words , assuming @xmath58 ( a computational complexity assumption slightly stronger than @xmath59 and nearly as widely believed ) , then there is no method by which one can efficiently test whether matrices are full spark . as such , the deterministic constructions in section  2 are significant in that they guarantee a property which is otherwise difficult to check .",
    "a square matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero , and in our quest for deterministic constructions of full spark frames , this characterization will reign supreme .",
    "one class of matrices has a particularly simple determinant formula : vandermonde matrices .",
    "specifically , vandermonde matrices have the following form : @xmath60 and square vandermonde matrices , i.e. , with @xmath61 , have the following determinant : @xmath62 consider in the case where @xmath63 . since every @xmath50 submatrix of @xmath64 is also vandermonde , we can modify the indices in to calculate the determinant of the submatrices .",
    "these determinants are nonzero precisely when the bases @xmath65 are distinct , yielding the following result :    [ lem.vandermonde ] a vandermonde matrix is full spark if and only if its bases are distinct .    to be clear , this result is not new .",
    "in fact , the full spark of vandermonde matrices was first exploited by fuchs  @xcite for sparse signal processing .",
    "later , bourguignon et al .",
    "@xcite specifically used the full spark of vandermonde matrices whose bases are sampled from the complex unit circle .",
    "interestingly , when viewed in terms of frame theory , vandermonde matrices naturally point to the discrete fourier transform :    [ thm.vandermonde ] the only @xmath13 vandermonde matrices that are equal norm and tight have bases in the complex unit circle . among these ,",
    "the frames with the smallest worst - case coherence have bases that are equally spaced in the complex unit circle , provided @xmath66 .",
    "suppose a vandermonde matrix is equal norm and tight .",
    "note that a zero base will produce the zeroth identity basis element @xmath67 . letting @xmath68 denote the indices of the nonzero bases , the fact that the matrix is full rank implies @xmath69 .",
    "also , equal norm gives that the frame element length @xmath70|^2=\\sum_{m=0}^{m-1}|\\alpha_n^m|^2=\\sum_{m=0}^{m-1}|\\alpha_n|^{2m}\\ ] ] is constant over @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath72 is strictly increasing over @xmath73 , there exists @xmath74 such that @xmath75 for all @xmath71 .",
    "next , tightness gives that the rows have equal norm , implying that the first two rows have equal norm , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "thus @xmath77 , and so the nonzero bases are in the complex unit circle .",
    "furthermore , since the zeroth and first rows have equal norm by tightness , we have @xmath78 , and so every base is in the complex unit circle .    now consider the inner product between vandermonde frame elements whose bases @xmath79 come from the complex unit circle : @xmath80 we will show that the worst - case coherence comes from the two closest bases . consider the following function : @xmath81 figure  [ figure ] gives a plot of this function in the case where @xmath82 .",
    "we will prove two things about this function :    * @xmath83 for every @xmath84 , * @xmath85 for every @xmath86 .     defined by in the case where @xmath82 .",
    "observe ( i ) that @xmath87 is strictly decreasing on the interval @xmath88 , and ( ii ) that @xmath89 for every @xmath90 .",
    "as established in the proof of theorem  [ thm.vandermonde ] , @xmath87 behaves in this manner for general values of @xmath0 .",
    "[ figure],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    first , we claim that ( i ) and ( ii ) are sufficient to prove our result . to establish this ,",
    "we first show that the two closest bases @xmath91 and @xmath92 satisfy @xmath93 . without loss of generality ,",
    "the @xmath94 s are ordered in such a way that @xmath95 are nondecreasing .",
    "define @xmath96 and let @xmath97 be the @xmath94 which minimizes @xmath98 . since the minimum is less than the average , we have @xmath99 provided @xmath100 . note that if we view @xmath101 as members of @xmath102 , then @xmath103 . since @xmath104 is even , then ( i ) implies that @xmath105 is larger than any other @xmath106 in which @xmath107\\cup[1-\\tfrac{1}{2m},1)$ ] .",
    "next , and ( ii ) together imply that @xmath108 is larger than any other @xmath106 in which @xmath109 , provided @xmath100 .",
    "combined , ( i ) and ( ii ) give that @xmath110 achieves the worst - case coherence of @xmath111 .",
    "additionally , ( i ) gives that the worst - case coherence @xmath110 is minimized when @xmath112 is maximized , i.e. , when the @xmath113 s are equally spaced in the unit interval .    to prove ( i ) , note that the geometric sum formula gives @xmath114 where the final expression uses the identity @xmath115 . to show that @xmath87 is decreasing over @xmath116 , note that the base of is positive on this interval , and performing the quotient rule to calculate its derivative will produce",
    "a fraction whose denominator is nonnegative and whose numerator is given by @xmath117 this factor is zero at @xmath118 and has derivative : @xmath119 which is strictly negative for all @xmath84 .",
    "hence , is strictly negative whenever @xmath84 , and so @xmath120 for every @xmath84 .",
    "for ( ii ) , note that for every @xmath121 , we can individually bound the numerator and denominator of what the geometric sum formula gives : @xmath122    consider the @xmath123 discrete fourier transform ( dft ) matrix , scaled to have entries of unit modulus : @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "the first @xmath0 rows of the dft form a vandermonde matrix of distinct bases @xmath126 ; as such , this matrix is full spark by lemma  [ lem.vandermonde ] .",
    "in fact , the previous result says that this is in some sense an optimal vandermonde frame , but this might not be the best way to pick rows from a dft . indeed , several choices of dft rows could produce full spark frames , some with smaller coherence or other desirable properties , and so the remainder of this section focuses on full spark dft submatrices .",
    "first , we note that not every dft submatrix is full spark . for example , consider the @xmath127 dft : @xmath128 certainly , the zeroth and second rows of this matrix are not full spark , since the zeroth and second columns of this submatrix form the all - ones matrix , which is not invertible .",
    "so what can be said about the set of permissible row choices ?",
    "the following result gives some necessary conditions on this set :    [ thm.closure ] take an @xmath123 discrete fourier transform matrix , and select the rows indexed by @xmath129 to build the matrix @xmath14 . if @xmath14 is full spark , then so is the matrix built from rows indexed by    * any translation of @xmath130 , * any @xmath131 with @xmath9 relatively prime to @xmath57 , * the complement of @xmath130 in @xmath132 .    for ( i )",
    ", we first define @xmath133 to be the @xmath123 diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are @xmath126 .",
    "note that , since @xmath134 , translating the row indices @xmath130 by @xmath135 corresponds to multiplying @xmath14 on the right by @xmath133 .",
    "for some set @xmath136 of size @xmath137 , let @xmath138 denote the @xmath50 submatrix of @xmath14 whose columns are indexed by @xmath139 , and let @xmath140 denote the @xmath50 diagonal submatrix of @xmath133 whose diagonal entries are indexed by @xmath139",
    ". then since @xmath140 is unitary , we have @xmath141 thus , if @xmath14 is full spark , @xmath142 , and so @xmath143 is also full spark .",
    "using this fact inductively proves ( i ) for all translations of @xmath130 .    for ( ii ) ,",
    "let @xmath144 denote the submatrix of rows indexed by @xmath131 .",
    "then for any set @xmath136 of size @xmath0 , @xmath145 since @xmath9 is relatively prime to @xmath57 , multiplication by @xmath9 permutes the elements of @xmath132 , and so @xmath146 has exactly @xmath0 distinct elements .",
    "thus , if @xmath14 is full spark , then @xmath147 , and so @xmath144 is also full spark .    for ( iii ) , we let @xmath144 be the @xmath148 submatrix of rows indexed by @xmath149 , so that @xmath150 we will use contraposition to show that @xmath14 being full spark implies that @xmath144 is also full spark . to this end ,",
    "suppose @xmath144 is not full spark .",
    "then @xmath144 has a collection of @xmath52 linearly dependent columns @xmath151 , and so there exists a nontrivial sequence @xmath152 such that @xmath153 considering @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the @xmath156th identity basis element , we can use to express this linear dependence in terms of @xmath14 : @xmath157 rearranging then gives @xmath158 here , we note that @xmath21 is nonzero since @xmath152 is nontrivial , and that @xmath159 .",
    "furthermore , whenever @xmath160 , we have from that @xmath161 and so @xmath162 .",
    "thus , the containment @xmath163 is proper , and so @xmath164 since the @xmath50 submatrix @xmath165 is rank - deficient , it is not invertible , and therefore @xmath14 is not full spark .",
    "we note that our proof of ( iii ) above uses techniques from cahill et al .",
    "@xcite , and can be easily generalized to prove that the naimark complement of a full spark tight frame is also full spark .",
    "theorem  [ thm.closure ] tells us quite a bit about the set of permissible choices for dft rows .",
    "for example , not only can we pick the first @xmath0 rows of the dft to produce a full spark vandermonde frame , but we can also pick any consecutive @xmath0 rows , by theorem  [ thm.closure](i ) .",
    "we would like to completely characterize the choices that produce full spark harmonic frames .",
    "the following classical result does this in the case where @xmath57 is prime :    let @xmath57 be prime .",
    "then every square submatrix of the @xmath123 discrete fourier transform matrix is invertible .    as an immediate consequence of chebotarv s theorem ,",
    "every choice of rows from the dft produces a full spark harmonic frame , provided @xmath57 is prime .",

    "@xcite , we can also use theorem  [ thm.uniformly distributed ] to determine whether harmonic equiangular tight frames with a prime power number of frame elements are full spark . unfortunately , none of the infinite families in  @xcite have the number of frame elements in the form of a prime power ( other than primes ) .",
    "luckily , there is at least one instance in which the number of frame elements happens to be a prime power : the harmonic frames that arise from singer difference sets have @xmath336 and @xmath337 for a prime power @xmath308 and an integer @xmath338 ; when @xmath339 and @xmath340 , the number of frame elements @xmath341 is a prime power . in this case , the row indices we select are @xmath342 but these are not uniformly distributed over 11 , and so the corresponding harmonic frame is not full spark by theorem  [ thm.uniformly distributed ] .",
    "recently , lu and do  @xcite showed that full spark frames are dense in the entire set of matrices .",
    "this corresponds to our intuition that a matrix whose entries are independent continuous random variables is full spark with probability one , which was also recently proved by blumensath and davies  @xcite . by contrast , as noted by gorodnitsky and rao  @xcite , certain classes of frames which arise in practice , such as in physical tomography , are never full spark .",
    "this issue also occurs in frame theory : steiner etfs form one of the largest known classes of etfs , and yet none of them are full spark  @xcite . as such , bourguignon et al .",

    ", we consider a very important class of frames , namely , those which exhibit parseval tightness , where the frame bound is @xmath135 .",
    "specifically , we show that full spark parseval frames are dense in the entire set of parseval frames . unlike the previous work in this vein ,",
    "our techniques exploit general concepts in algebraic geometry , lending themselves to future application in proving further density results .    in order to make our arguments rigorous",
    ", we view each entry @xmath343 of the @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 in terms of its real and imaginary parts : @xmath344 ; this decomposition will become helpful later when we consider inner products between rows of @xmath14 , which are not algebraic operations on complex vectors . recall that @xmath14 is full spark precisely when each @xmath50 submatrix has nonzero determinant .",
    "we note that for each submatrix , the determinant is a polynomial in the @xmath345 s and @xmath346 s , and having this polynomial be nonzero is equivalent to having either its real or imaginary part be nonzero .",
    "this naturally leads us to the following definition from algebraic geometry : a _ real algebraic variety _ is the set of common zeros of a finite set of polynomials , that is , given polynomials @xmath347 $ ] , we define the corresponding real algebraic variety by @xmath348 each submatrix determinant corresponds to a real algebraic variety @xmath349 of two polynomials , and having this determinant be nonzero is equivalent to restricting to the complement of @xmath64 .    in general , a variety is equipped with a topology known as the _ zariski topology _ , in which subvarieties are the closed sets . as such , the set of matrices with a nonzero determinant forms a zariski - open set , since it is the complement of a variety . in order to exploit this zariski - openness , we require the additional concept of irreducibility : a variety is said to be _",
    "irreducible _ if it can not be written as a finite union of proper subvarieties .",
    "as an example , the entire space @xmath350 is the variety which corresponds to the zero polynomial ; in this case , every proper subvariety is lower - dimensional , and so @xmath350 is trivially irreducible . on the other hand ,",
    "the variety in @xmath351 defined by @xmath352 is not irreducible because it can be expressed as the union of varieties defined by @xmath118 and @xmath353 .",
    "irreducibility is important because it says something about zariski - open sets :    [ thm.irreducible dense ] if @xmath64 is an irreducible algebraic variety , then every nonempty zariski - open subset of @xmath64 is dense in @xmath64 in the standard topology .",
    "for example , the hyperplane defined by @xmath354 is a subvariety of @xmath350 , and since @xmath350 is irreducible , the complement of the hyperplane is dense in the standard topology .",
    "going back to the variety defined by @xmath352 , we know it can be expressed as a union of proper subvarieties , namely the @xmath21- and @xmath37-axes , and complementing one gives a subset of the other , neither of which is dense in the entire variety .",
    "we are now ready to prove the following result :    [ thm.overall density ] every matrix is arbitrarily close to a full spark frame .    in an @xmath13 matrix",
    ", there are @xmath355 submatrices of size @xmath50 , and the determinant of each of these submatrices corresponds to a variety of two real polynomials .",
    "since the set of @xmath13 full spark frames is defined as the ( finite ) intersection of the complements of these varieties , it is a zariski - open subset of the irreducible variety @xmath356 of all @xmath13 matrices .",
    "moreover , this set is nonempty since it contains the matrix formed by the first @xmath0 rows of the @xmath123 dft , and so we are done by theorem  [ thm.irreducible dense ] .",
    "we now focus on the set of _ parseval frames _ , that is , tight frames with frame bound @xmath135 .",
    "note that @xmath13 parseval frames are characterized by the rows forming an orthonormal system of size @xmath0 in @xmath57-dimensional space .",
    "the set of all such orthonormal systems is known as the _ stiefel manifold _",
    ", denoted @xmath357 . in general , a _",
    "manifold _ is a set of vectors with a well - defined tangent space at every point in the set .",
    "since this manifold property is nice , we would like to think of varieties as manifolds , but there exist varieties with points at which tangent spaces are not well - defined ; such points are called _ singularities_. note that our definition of singularity is geometric , i.e. , where the variety fails to be a real differentiable manifold , as opposed to algebraic . for example , the variety defined by @xmath352 is the union of the @xmath21- and @xmath37-axes , and as such , has a singularity at @xmath358 .",
    "certainly with different types of varieties , there are other types of singularities which may arise , but there are also many varieties which do not have singularities at all , and we call these varieties _ nonsingular_. nonsingularity is a useful property for the following reason :    [ thm.irreducible ] an algebraic variety which is nonsingular and connected is necessarily irreducible .",
    "this result follows from theorem i.5.1 and remark iii.7.9.1 of hartshorne  @xcite , which assumes that the variety is over an algebraically closed field , unlike @xmath359 ; however , the proof is unaffected when removing the algebraically - closed assumption .",
    "note that the orthonormality conditions which characterize parseval frames @xmath14 can be expressed as polynomial equations in the real and imaginary parts of the entries @xmath343 . as such",
    ", we may view the stiefel manifold as a real algebraic variety ; this variety is nonsingular because it is a manifold .",
    "moreover , the variety is connected because the ( connected ) unitary group @xmath360 acts transitively on @xmath357 .",
    "thus by theorem  [ thm.irreducible ] , the variety of parseval frames is irreducible .",
    "having established this , we can now prove the following result :    [ thm.parseval density ] every parseval frame is arbitrarily close to a full spark parseval frame .",
    "proceeding as in the proof of theorem  [ thm.overall density ] , we have that the set of @xmath13 full spark parseval frames is zariski - open in the irreducible variety of all @xmath13 parseval frames .",
    "again considering the first @xmath0 rows of the @xmath123 dft , we know this set is nonempty , and so we are done by theorem  [ thm.irreducible dense ] .",
    "we note that theorems  [ thm.overall density ] and  [ thm.parseval density ] are also true when we further require the frames to be real . in this case",
    ", we can not use the first @xmath0 rows of the @xmath123 dft to establish that the zariski - open sets are nonempty . for the real version of theorem  [ thm.overall density ] ,",
    "we use an @xmath13 vandermonde matrix with distinct real bases ; see lemma  [ lem.vandermonde ] .",
    "however , this construction must be modified to use it in the proof of the real version of theorem  [ thm.parseval density ] , since such vandermonde matrices will not be tight ; see theorem  [ thm.vandermonde ] . given an @xmath13 full spark frame @xmath14 , the modification @xmath361 is full spark and parseval ; indeed , @xmath362 , and since @xmath14 is a frame , @xmath363 is full rank , and so the columns of @xmath144 are linearly independent precisely when the corresponding columns of @xmath14 are linearly independent .",
    "another way that the proof of theorem  [ thm.parseval density ] changes in the real case is in verifying that the real stiefel manifold is irreducible . just as in the complex case",
    ", this follows from theorem  [ thm.irreducible ] since @xmath357 is connected  @xcite , but the fact that @xmath357 is connected in the real case is not immediate . by analogy ,",
    "the orthogonal group @xmath364 certainly acts transitively on @xmath357 , but unlike the unitary group , the orthogonal group has two connected components . intuitively , this is resolved by the fact that @xmath365 , granting additional freedom of movement throughout @xmath357 .",
    "in addition to theorems  [ thm.overall density ] and  [ thm.parseval density ] , we would like a similar result for unit norm tight frames , i.e. , that every unit norm tight frame is arbitrarily close to a full spark unit norm tight frame .",
    "certainly , the set of unit norm tight frames is a real algebraic variety , but it is unclear whether this variety is irreducible . without knowing whether the variety is irreducible , we can follow the proofs of theorems  [ thm.overall density ] and  [ thm.parseval density ] to conclude that full spark unit norm tight frames are dense in the irreducible components in which they exist  a far cry from the density result we seek .",
    "this illustrates a significant gap in our current understanding of the variety of unit norm tight frames . it should be mentioned that strawn  @xcite showed that the variety of @xmath13 unit norm tight frames ( over real or complex space ) is nonsingular precisely when @xmath0 and @xmath57 are relatively prime .",
    "additionally , dykema and strawn  @xcite proved that the variety of @xmath366 real unit norm tight frames is connected , and so by theorem  [ thm.irreducible ] , this variety is irreducible when @xmath57 is odd .",
    "it is unknown whether the variety of @xmath13 unit norm tight frames is connected in general .",
    "finally , we note that a theorem  [ thm.parseval density ] gives a weaker version of the result we would like : every unit norm tight frame is arbitrarily close to a full spark tight frame with frame element lengths arbitrarily close to @xmath135 .",
    "in the previous section , we demonstrated the abundance of full spark frames , even after imposing the additional condition of tightness . but how much computation is required to check whether a particular frame is full spark ? at the heart of the matter is computational complexity theory , which provides a rigorous playing field for expressing how hard certain problems are . in this section",
    ", we consider the complexity of the following problem :      for the lay mathematician , full spark is `` obviously '' @xmath1-hard because the easiest way he can think to solve it for a given @xmath13 matrix is by determining whether each of the @xmath50 submatrices is invertible ; computing @xmath355 determinants would do , but this would take a lot of time , and so full spark must be @xmath1-hard .",
    "however , computing @xmath355 determinants may not necessarily be the fastest way to test whether a matrix is full spark .",
    "for example , perhaps there is an easy - to - calculate expression for the product of the determinants ; after all , this product is nonzero precisely when the matrix is full spark . recall that theorem  [ thm.uniformly distributed ] gives a very straightforward litmus test for full spark in the special case where the matrix is formed by rows of a dft of prime - power order  who s to say that a version of this test does not exist for the general case ?",
    "if such a test exists , then it would suffice to find it , but how might one disprove the existence of any such test ? indeed , since we are concerned with the necessary amount of computation , as opposed to a sufficient amount , the lay mathematician s intuition is a bit misguided .    to discern how much computation is necessary , the main feature of interest is a problem s _",
    "complexity_. we use complexity to compare problems and determine whether one is harder than the other . as an example of complexity , intuitively , doubling an integer is no harder than adding integers , since one can use addition to multiply by @xmath194 ; put another way , the complexity of doubling is somehow `` encoded '' in the complexity of adding , and so it must be lesser ( or equal ) . to make this more precise , complexity theorists use what is called a _",

    "finally , a problem @xmath8 is called @xmath1-_hard _ if every problem @xmath9 in @xmath1 reduces to @xmath8 , and a problem is called @xmath1-_complete _ if it is both @xmath1-hard and in @xmath1 . in plain speak ,",
    "@xmath1-hard problems are harder than every problem in @xmath1 , while @xmath1-complete problems are the hardest of problems in @xmath1 .    at this point , it should be clear that @xmath1-hard problems are not merely problems that seem to require a lot of computation to solve .",
    "certainly , @xmath1-hard problems have this quality , as an @xmath1-hard problem can be solved in polynomial time only if @xmath373 ; this is an open problem , but it is widely believed that @xmath59 . however , there are other problems which seem hard but are not known to be @xmath1-hard ( e.g. , the graph isomorphism problem ) .",
    "rather , to determine whether a problem is @xmath1-hard , one must find a polynomial - time reduction that compares the problem to all problems in @xmath1 . to this end ,",
    "notice that @xmath367 and @xmath374 together imply @xmath375 , and so to demonstrate that a problem @xmath376 is @xmath1-hard , it suffices to show that @xmath374 for some @xmath1-hard problem @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , it can sometimes be difficult to find a deterministic reduction from one problem to another .",
    "one example is reducing the satisfiability problem ( sat ) to the unique satisfiability problem ( unique  sat ) . to be clear",
    ", sat is an @xmath1-hard problem  @xcite that asks whether there exists an input for which a given boolean function returns `` true , '' while unique  sat asks the same question with an additional promise : that the given boolean function is satisfiable only if there is a _ unique _",
    "input for which it returns `` true . '' intuitively , unique  sat is easier than sat because we might be able to exploit the additional structure of uniquely satisfiable boolean functions ; thus , it could be difficult to find a reduction from sat to unique  sat .",
    "despite this intuition , there is a _",
    "randomized _ polynomial - time reduction from sat to unique  sat  @xcite .",
    "defined over all boolean functions of @xmath94 variables , the reduction maps functions that are not satisfiable to other functions that are not satisfiable , and with probability @xmath377 , it maps satisfiable functions to uniquely satisfiable functions . after applying this reduction to a given boolean function , if a unique  sat oracle declares `` uniquely satisfiable , '' then we know for certain that the original boolean function was satisfiable .",
    "but the reduction will only map a satisfiable problem to a uniquely satisfiable problem with probability @xmath377 , so what good is this reduction ?",
    "the answer lies in something called _ amplification _ ; since the success probability is , at worst , polynomially small in @xmath94 ( i.e. , @xmath378 ) , we can repeat our oracle - based randomized algorithm a polynomial number of times @xmath379 and achieve an error probability @xmath380 which is exponentially small .    in this section ,",
    "we give a randomized polynomial - time reduction from a problem in matroid theory . before stating the problem , we first briefly review some definitions . to each bipartite graph with bipartition @xmath381 ,",
    "we associate a _ transversal matroid _ @xmath382 , where @xmath319 is the collection of subsets of @xmath383 whose vertices form the ends of a matching in the bipartite graph ; subsets in @xmath319 are called @xmath384 .",
