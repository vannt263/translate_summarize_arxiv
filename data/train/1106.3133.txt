    "the mixing in the lepton sector is named as the pontecorvo @xcite - maki - nakawaga - sakata @xcite ( pmns ) matrix , which can account for the currently available data on the observation of solar , atmospheric neutrino oscillations and the reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments @xcite . in the standard model ,",

( [ pmns2 ] ) ] ; thus , null @xmath12 would imply that one can not observe @xmath13 violation at lepton sector in the framework of the standard model even though @xmath14 is not zero .",
    "obviously , there is no priori that the @xmath13 violation should appear at the lepton sector , but only nonzero @xmath12 can intrigue an enthusiasm to explore @xmath13 violation at the lepton sector . once the @xmath12 is determined to be nonzero as the t2k experiment and our theoretical prediction made in this work suggest , the next step would be searching for @xmath13 violation at the lepton sector .",
    "indeed , the tribimaximal symmetry is well manifested by the data .",
    "a rigorous symmetry would demand @xmath12 to be zero ; however , it is not the whole story because this elegant symmetry is to be broken , and a nonzero @xmath12 is expected .",

    "( [ tribi ] ) can be further written as a sequential product of two independent rotations on 12 and 23 planes : @xmath32 and @xmath33 becomes a @xmath34 unit matrix , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "friedberg and lee @xcite propose a geometrical interpretation for the tribimaximal symmetry as shown in fig .",
    "[ figcube ] . for readers convenience ,",
    "let us briefly introduce friedberg and lee s geometrical model and their conventions @xcite .",
    "the charged leptons in the basis @xmath36 correspond to the three mutually perpendicular sides of a cube , and the neutrino basis @xmath37 corresponds to another coordinate system ( see fig . [ figcube ] ) .",
    "these two coordinate systems are related to each other by rotations .",
    "one can perform two independent rotations to associate them . @xmath38 and",
    "@xmath39 transform the two independent bases into a common one .",
    "these practical operations are described below .",
    "@xmath38 mixes the second and third components of the basis @xmath40 and keeps the first one invariant to get a new basis @xmath41 , while @xmath39 mixes the first and second components of @xmath42 , retaining the third one invariant to reach the same basis @xmath41 .",
    "the mathematical expressions for relating @xmath43 with the charged lepton basis @xmath44 and neutrino basis @xmath45 are shown as follows : @xmath46 following the convention given in ref .",
    "@xcite , when we discuss the geometry structure , we abbreviate the sides @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) as @xmath49 @xmath50 without causing any confusion . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 just refer to the corresponding geometrical quantities marked in fig .",
    "[ figcube ] and are by no means the physical states .",
    "comparing @xmath35 with @xmath53 , it appears that the two rotations @xmath38 and @xmath39 correspond to the mixing matrices for the charged leptons and neutrinos , respectively .",
    "it is noted that in eq .",
    "( [ lee ] ) , we only concern the mixing parts ; thus , inserting @xmath54 between @xmath55 and @xmath56 which is irrelevant to our geometrical settings , we just derive the lagrangian of weak interaction .",
    "we also would like to point out that in eq .",
    "( [ lee ] ) , the high symmetry is assumed , and all quantities are indeed corresponding to the zeroth order ones @xcite , and then later when we introduce a deformation of the cube to break the tribimaximal symmetry , the concerned quantities would turn into the physical ones .    concretely , in fig .",
    "[ figcube ] , sides @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 represent @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ; and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 correspond to @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "the line-@xmath69 resides on the plane @xmath70 and spans an angle of @xmath29 with respect to the @xmath59 axis , whereas line @xmath71 , line @xmath69 , and line @xmath67 compose three - dimensional mutually perpendicular coordinate axes , and according the right - hand rule , we have an @xmath72 system .",
    "the angle spanned between @xmath71 and @xmath57 is @xmath0 . therefore , the two rectangular coordinate systems transform from each other by two rotations about the axes @xmath57 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the right - handed rotation @xmath38 about the @xmath57 axis brings @xmath61 to @xmath73 and @xmath62 to @xmath65 , and a second right - handed rotation @xmath39 , with @xmath74 , turns @xmath63 into @xmath60 and @xmath64 into @xmath73 .",
    "then , after performing the two successive operations , the basis @xmath43 shown above can be directly read out as @xmath75 .    although the tribimaximal mixing ansatz is close to the experimental data and exhibits a striking symmetry , it is not the exact form of the pmns matrix .",
    "moreover , this symmetry demands @xmath12 to be zero . if the tribimaximal symmetry is not exact , with the angles @xmath1 and @xmath0 obviously deviate from the values determined by the symmetry , one has sufficient reason to believe that @xmath12 should not be zero .",
    "in fact , the previous measurements set a lower bound for @xmath12 as @xmath76 @xcite , and will be more precisely measured at the upcoming reactor experiments daya bay @xcite and double chooz @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate how to break the tribimaximal symmetry from a theoretical aspect .",
    "friedberg and lee suggest to break the symmetry from the charged lepton side @xcite , whereas he and his collaborators break the symmetry from the neutrino sector @xcite . since the whole mixing matrix is a product of the two unitary matrices that , respectively , diagonalize the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices as @xmath77 , breaking from either side is just like climbing up mount everest from the south or north side as lee comments@xcite . their schemes to break the symmetry are algebraic .",
    "instead , in this work , we propose to break the symmetry based on friedberg and lee s geometrical picture .",
    "namely , we let the cube be slightly deformed and the nonzero @xmath12 value would emerge . concretely , by deforming the geometric representation of the tribimaximal mixing , the angles would deviate from their ideal values ; by fitting them to the data , we determine the deformation scale of the cube , and then by the new geometric shape @xmath12 is no longer zero .    the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present our geometrical model of deforming the cube to get the @xmath12 as a function of the other two mixing angles . then , in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical results .",
    "the last section is devoted to our conclusion and some discussions .    , @xmath78 , and @xmath79.,width=396,height=321 ]",
    "it is noticeable that the angle between lines @xmath73 and @xmath67 and that between @xmath58 and @xmath73 in the cube are precisely the two mixing angles of the tribimaximal matrix @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . for a perfect symmetry , which corresponds to a complete cube",
    ", we have @xmath74 and @xmath80 , which are determined by the geometry .",
    "it is then viable that a deformation would lead to the more realistic form of the pmns matrix , and , thus , the nonzero @xmath12 would emerge .",
    "after this deformation , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not the values given above anymore , but dependent on the form of the deformation .",
    "a cube is a kind of polyhedron with high symmetry described by a certain group , so a deformation of a cube should be regarded as a symmetry breaking .",
    "now , let us demonstrate how to deform the above cube . for choosing the deformation scheme",
    ", we set three principles :    * there are three rotation axes for a cube as presented in fig . [ cubeaxis ] , i.e. , @xmath81 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "apparently , the axis @xmath79 is related with the mixing angle @xmath0 ( @xmath82 ) , and the axis @xmath78 , which is parallel to the side oa , is related to @xmath1 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "then , the rest symmetry axis @xmath81 may be related to the zero @xmath12 in the tribimaximal mixing .",
    "thus , after the supposed deformation , the three symmetries would be broken , and the value of the deformation angle is related to @xmath12 . for simplicity , we just choose the deformation angle to be @xmath12 .",
    "* for the tribimaximal mixing , @xmath1 = @xmath29 and @xmath12 = 0 , there exists the @xmath84 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the global fit @xcite gives @xmath85 , which apparently breaks the @xmath86 symmetry .",
    "thus , in the deformation , @xmath1 ( @xmath83 ) should be changed from @xmath29 to some values in order to break the @xmath86 symmetry . * in ref .",
    "@xcite , the global fits of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively . thus , for the deformation , @xmath0 ( @xmath82 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath83 ) should be changed toward smaller values than @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "considering above principles , the simplest and most direct scheme to deform the cube is to slide the bottom face parallel to the top face , and a small angle would emerge , and this angle is identified as @xmath12 .",
    "the length of each side is unchanged during the slide .",
    "this operation is explicitly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ twist ] .        with the parallel slide , the bottom face becomes @xmath89 . to be consistent with friedberg and lee s picture and the principles we proposed above",
    ", we identify @xmath0 = @xmath90 , @xmath1 = @xmath91 , and @xmath12 = @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 is the point of intersection between side @xmath94 and plane @xmath89 . @xmath95 and @xmath96 are perpendicular to the diagonal line @xmath97 .    setting @xmath98 and in the rectangular triangle rt@xmath99",
    ", one has @xmath100 in @xmath101 , @xmath102 and in @xmath103 , @xmath104 @xmath105    the geometrical relationship of the sides and angles in the deformed cube would determine eq .",
    "( [ ag1 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ ag2 ] ) , and eq .",
    "( [ ee0f ] ) . from these equations",
    ", we can get an analytical expression of @xmath12 , with respect to the other two mixing angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath106    as we have mentioned above , a cube is a highly symmetric polyhedron that could be represented by a global @xmath107 group @xcite .",
    "this group has 24 elements classified in five conjugate classes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ cubeaxis ] , a cube has three kinds of rotation axes , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , corresponding to @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "all the rotation axes in the same @xmath114 are equivalent .",
    "it is notable that the angle between the axes of @xmath115 and @xmath110 is @xmath29 , and the angle between the axes of @xmath115 and @xmath109 is @xmath116 . in other words ,",
    "the two angles are exactly that in the tribimaximal form of the pmns matrix .",
    "another angle corresponding to @xmath12 must be an angle between @xmath110 and @xmath110 itself , so @xmath117 .    with the deformation",
    ", the symmetry of the cube is broken , and @xmath12 acquires a nonzero value .",
    "we can then view @xmath12 as the parameter representing the deviation from the cubic symmetry .",

    "@xcite presents the updated global fit to the three - generation neutrino mixing : @xmath118 using the data as inputs , we obtain the numerical value of @xmath12 : @xmath119 the errors of the fit would cause a theoretical uncertainty to @xmath12 : @xmath120 the errors are rather large , and , in fact , to make @xmath121 , the lower bound shown in the above expression is set .",
    "this expression indicates that our prediction on @xmath12 is somehow sensitive to the input data and that in order to get more precise values of @xmath12 , more precise values of the input are needed .",
