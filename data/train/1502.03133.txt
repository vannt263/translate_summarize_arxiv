    "recently , the study of bilateral ( also known as barrel - like ) supernova remnants ( snr ) has gained great interest since they have proven to be a useful tool when studying the configuration of the interstellar magnetic field ( ismf ) on scales of a few pc . as their name suggests , these type of snrs display two characteristic bright and opposite arcs .",
    "the morphology of this type of remnants has been explained with an ismf , which is involved in the acceleration mechanism of relativistic particles .",
    "however , there is still debate as to which is the most efficient acceleration mechanism in these objects .",
    "one interpretation is the equatorial belt model , in which the orientation of the ismf is quasi - perpendicular to the shock front normal .",
    "the other interpretation is the polar cap model in which they are quasi - parallel .",
    "the remnant of sn1006 is the archetype of the bilateral snr group .",
    "it has a diameter of 30(or 20 pc at a distance of 2.2 kpc , @xcite ) and , in radio - continuum and x - ray images , exhibits an incomplete shell with two bright arcs perpendicular to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "sn1006 is accepted to be the result of a type ia sn explosion @xcite .",
    "this remnant is located at a high galactic latitude , and therefore thought to be evolving in an almost homogeneous interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "for this reason , the radio - continuum morphology of the remnant must be mostly affected by the characteristics of the surrounding ismf .",
    "numerous theoretical and observational studies have been devoted to analyze which mechanism is responsible for the morphology of this remnant , giving rise to two opposing interpretations : either the quasi - perpendicular acceleration mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the quasi - parallel mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these works apply criteria based only on the brightness distribution of the synchrotron emission . accordingly , their conclusions are strongly dependent on the orientation of the ismf respect to the line of sight ( _ los _ ) , and can not determine which particle acceleration mechanism is actually taking place .",
    "a recent observational polarization study seems to favour the idea that the bright arcs of sn1006 can be explained by the polar cap model , implying an ismf parallel to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the present work is an effort to clarify which process or mechanism is more suitable to explain the synchrotron emission of the remnant of sn1006 .",
    "for this purpose , we carried out 3d mhd simulations employing the same scenario proposed in @xcite . from the numerical results",
    ", we performed a polarization analysis of the stokes parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as well as the polar - referenced angle , thus facilitating the direct comparison with observations .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows : section  [ numerical ] presents the initial setup for the mhd simulations , section  [ synthetic ] explains how the synthetic maps for the radio emission and stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters were calculated , section  [ results ] introduces the results obtained which are further discussed and summarized in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the numerical simulations were carried out with the parallelized 3d mhd code mezcal @xcite .",
    "this code solves the full set of ideal mhd equations in cartesian geometry ( @xmath2 ) with an adaptive mesh , and includes a cooling function to account for radiative losses @xcite .",
    "the computational domain is a cube of @xmath3 pc per side and it is discretized on a six level binary grid , with a maximum resolution of @xmath4 pc .",
    "all the outer boundaries were set to an outflow condition ( gradient free ) .",
    "the physical parameters of the snr setup are the same as those presented in @xcite , but to help the readability of the present paper , we reproduce them below .",
    "a supernovae explosion is initialized by the deposition of @xmath5 erg of energy in a radius of @xmath6 pc located at the centre of the computational domain .",
    "the energy is distributed such that @xmath7 of it is kinetic and the remaining @xmath8 is thermal .",
    "the ejected mass was distributed in two parts : an inner homogeneous sphere of radius @xmath9 containing @xmath10ths of the total mass ( m@xmath11m@xmath12 ) with a density @xmath13 , and an outer shell containing the remaining @xmath14ths of the mass following a power law ( @xmath15 ) as in @xcite .",

    "following @xcite , we created maps of the angular difference for the position angle @xmath70 with respect to the local radial direction @xmath71 , i.e. we obtained maps with the distribution of the polar - referenced angle @xmath72 , which is given by : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the direction of the magnetic field on the plane of the sky . in this representation ,",

    "sn1006 is a member of a population of ` barrel - like ' or ` bilateral ' snrs .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that the emission geometry of bilateral snrs is correlated with the orientation of the ambient interstellar magnetic field .",
    "different orientations of the magnetic field can be inferred depending upon which particle acceleration mechanism is assumed to be taking place at the snr shock front , either the quasi - parallel or the quasi - perpendicular model .    as mentioned above",
    ", there is an ongoing debate as to which of these two particle acceleration mechanisms is responsible for the observed syncrotron emission in snrs .",
    "while observational works seem to support the quasi - parallel model ( polar cap scenario ) , theoretical studies are not conclusive .",
    "a probable reason for this discrepancy is that most of the theoretical works base their conclusions on criteria which only take into account the brightness distribution of the synchrotron emission .    in the present work , we explore if a theoretical polarization study can be a useful tool to shed some light on this question .",
    "we synthesized maps of the polarized emission that include stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the distribution of the polar - referenced angle @xmath72 . in our analysis , we considered two scenarios : ( 1 ) * an * equatorial belt model where the bright rims of sn1006 are formed from particle acceleration that occurs when the shock passes through interstellar magnetic fields that are perpendicular to the shock normal ( quasi - perpendicular ) ; ( 2 ) a polar cap model where the bright rims are formed from acceleration that occurs when the shock passes through magnetic fields that are parallel to the shock normal ( quasi - parallel ) .",
    "the resulting polarized intensity maps alone are not sufficient to decide which mechanism is the adequate to explain the radio morphology of sn1006 since both scenarios , quasi - parallel and quasi - perpendicular , yield similar results . on the contrary ,",
    "the synthetic @xmath0 maps for the quasi - parallel and quasi - perpendicular cases differ much from each other .",
    "the quasi - perpendicular @xmath0 map displays regions with negative values resembling the bright rims observed in the polarized intensity maps .",
    "this result is in disagreement with the observations , which mainly display positive values .",
    "in addition , our simulated @xmath0 map for the quasi - parallel case coincides with observations in that the maxima are spatially coincident with the bright arcs of sn1006 , as obtained in our synthetic @xmath0 map for the quasi - parallel case .",
    "finally , the synthetic polar - referenced angle map for the quasi - parallel model is in very good agreement with the results reported by @xcite .",
    "our results agree with @xcite in that the ism magnetic field must be parallel to the galactic plane , tilted with respect to the _ los _ , and with a gradient that explains the assymetry in the emission between the arcs .",
    "the difference between their result and ours lies in the degree of inclination with respect to the _ los_. for the parameter @xmath0 to be comparable to the observations , we employed an inclination of 75with respect to the @xmath58 ( 15respect to the plane of the sky ) , which is somewhat larger than the best fit ( @xmath81 ) reported in @xcite .",
    "we calculated the polar - referenced angle ( @xmath72 ) distribution and found a good agreement with the observations of sn1006 of @xcite .",
    "the maps of observed @xmath72 show small scale structure that is absent on our models due to the well ordered field imposed .",
    "this technique might prove helpful for future studies that include the inhomogeneity of the media or of the magnetic field structure .    in summary ,",
    "our polarization results provide a strong support to the quasi parallel model , which is in agreement with previous observational @xcite and theoretical works @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the stokes parameter @xmath0 proved to be a powerful tool to determine the particle acceleration mechanism that best explains the observed morphology and polarization seen in sn1006 .",
    "we note that in a previous 2d mhd numerical simulation , @xcite concluded that the quasi - perpendicular model was the most suitable to explain the observations .",
    "our paper shows the importance of using 3d simulations , since limiting the analysis to what is possible with an axisymmetric setup led to an opposite result . only a 3d model can account for a magnetic field that is tilted with respect to the _ los _ and can provide a realistic description of the particle acceleration and synchrotron emission of an snr",
