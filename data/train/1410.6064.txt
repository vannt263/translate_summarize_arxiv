    "[ [ section ] ]    the reaction network we aim to control .",
    "the state evolution is by @xmath3 reaction channels : if the state is @xmath4 , then the @xmath5-th reaction fires at rate @xmath6 and it displaces the state by the _ stoichiometric vector _ , @xmath7 , . here",
    "@xmath8 is called the _",
    "propensity function _ of the @xmath5-th reaction and is assumed if for any @xmath9 we have @xmath10 , then @xmath11 , .",
    "this property ensures that molecular counts of all the species remain nonnegative throughout the dynamics .",
    "we now fix a state - space @xmath12 for the markovian reaction dynamics .",
    "this set @xmath12 is a non - empty subset of @xmath13 which is closed under the reaction dynamics .",
    "this means that for any state @xmath14 we must also have @xmath15 if the the @xmath5-th reaction has a positive rate of firing ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "selecting @xmath12 this way allows us to use it as a generic state - space for all markov processes describing the reaction kinetics and starting at an initial state in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 the continuous time markov process representing the reaction dynamics with an initial state @xmath18 .    from a control theoretic point of view , it is necessary to define input and output nodes of the above network .",
    "we assume here that species @xmath19 is the _ actuated species _ which is the species can act on .",
    "the _ regulated species _ is @xmath0 , for some @xmath20 , and it is the species .    [ [ section-1 ] ]    [ problem ] find a controller such that , by suitably acting on the actuated species @xmath19 , we have the following properties for the closed - loop network ( defined here as the interconnection of the open - loop network @xmath21 described above with the controller ):    1 .",
    "the closed - loop network is ergodic ; 2 .",
    "the first and second - order moments of @xmath22 exist and are uniformly bounded and globally converging to their unique stationary value ; 3 .",
    "we have that @xmath23\\to\\mu^*$ ] as @xmath24 for some desired set - point @xmath25 .",
    "the first requirement is fairly standard . indeed , ergodicity is the analogue of having a globally attracting fixed point for deterministic dynamics ( i.e. global stability ) and is required here so that the closed - loop network is well - behaved , in the sense that it reaches stationarity .",
    "the second requirement is more specific to stochastic processes , as even if the means converge , the variance can , which would mean that the actual dynamics of the process ( its sample - paths ) is not well - behaved , .",
    "finally , the third statement encapsulates our desired objective of perfect adaptation ( or set - point tracking ) , i.e. that the population mean approaches a fixed homeostatic value @xmath26 .",
    "we propose the following controller network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cloud ] ) inspired from the deterministic networks proposed in @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath0 is the , which is identical to the _ regulated species _ in the current setup .",
    "the species @xmath1 and @xmath2 are referred to as the _ controller species_. note that the topology of the controller network belongs to a family of four control topologies ( see the supplementary material ) depending on .",
    "although inspired from @xcite , the above network has a different philosophy .",
    "besides the fact that the current setting is stochastic , the main difference lies in the way the network interacts with the environment .",
    "while the goal of @xcite was the biomolecular implementation of linear input - output systems , the goal here is to control a reaction network . in this regard ,",
    "the birth - reactions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 clearly differ from the way they are defined in @xcite .",
    "we now clarify the role and meaning of each of the reactions :    1 .",
    "the first reaction is the _ reference reaction _ ( or set - point ) which ( partially ) sets the value of the reference @xmath28 .",
    "this value is implemented as the birth - rate of species @xmath1 .",
    "the second reaction is the _ measurement reaction _ and takes the form of a pure - birth reaction with a rate proportional to the current population of the regulated species @xmath0 . ] .",
    "it is referred to as the _ measurement reaction _ as the rate of increase of the population of @xmath2 reflects the population of @xmath0 .",
    "the third reaction implements the _ comparison reaction _ ,",
    "@xmath29 that can be tuned .",
    "the main role of this reaction is to correlate both the populations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and to prevent them from growing without bounds .",
    "this reaction can be viewed as a _ compare and substract operation _ since when both @xmath1 and @xmath2 have positive populations ( comparison ) , then , thereby preserving the difference .",
    "the last reaction is the _ actuation reaction _ , which implements the way the controller acts on the system , i.e. by acting on the birth - rate of the actuated species @xmath19 . ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is also a tuning parameter of the controller .",
    "the above controller has been chosen with an implementability constraint in mind , as it is expressed as plausible reactions that may be implemented in - vivo to perform _ in - vivo control_. it will be shown later that the proposed controller exhibits strong robustness properties which make its implementation much easier than other types of controllers that require the fine tuning of their reaction rates ( see the supplementary material ) . in - vitro control is also possible using , for instance , dna strand displacement @xcite .",
    "in - silico control @xcite can be considered as well , whenever the population size of regulated species @xmath0 can be measured in real - time from outside of the cell(s ) using , for instance , microscopy .",
    "[ th : general_cl ]    [ th : p : affine : nominal ]    a more general version of this result and its extension to a class of bimolecular networks are provided in the supplementary material . in light of theorem",
    "[ th : p : affine : nominal ] , several favorable properties for the controller and the closed - loop network can now be .",
    "* ergodicity , set - point tracking and bounded first- and second - order moments .",
    "* these are the main properties sought in .    *",
    "robustness . *",
    "robustness is a fundamental which ensures that some properties for the closed - loop network are preserved , even in the presence of model uncertainties .",
    "this concept is critical in biology as the environment is fluctuating or and available .",
    "the obtained results can automatically guarantee the preservation of all the properties stated in theorem  [ th : p : affine : nominal ] , even in such constraining conditions .    * .",
    "* ergodicity ensures that the population average at stationarity is equal to the asymptotic value of the time - average of any single - cell trajectory ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the proposed controller achieves two goals simultaneously , as it can ensure robust set - point tracking at both the population and single - cell levels . as a consequence",
    ", the controller will also ensure single - cell set - point tracking in the presence of cell events such as cell - division when certain conditions are met ( see the supplementary material for more details ) .    * circumventing moment closure difficulties . *",
    "finally , we emphasize that using the proposed approach , the moment closure problem does not arise , as the ( e.g. ergodicity , set - point tracking and robustness ) directly follow from stochastic analysis tools and the structure of the controller , thereby avoiding altogether the framework of the moment equations ( see the supplementary material ) .",
    "the goal of this example is to demonstrate that set - point tracking and perfect adaptation can be ensured with respect to any change in the parameters of the gene expression network @xmath30 where @xmath19 denotes the mrna and @xmath31 the measured / regulated species ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : adaptation ] ) .",
    "the following result is proved in the supplementary material :    for any positive values of the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the controlled gene expression network - is ergodic , has bounded and globally converging first- and second - order moments and @xmath34\\to\\dfrac{\\mu}{\\theta}\\quad \\textnormal{as}\\quad t\\to\\infty.\\ ] ]    = \\mu/\\theta$ ] for any values of the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 $ ] denotes the mean number of molecules of @xmath31 at stationarity . * c. * the controlled - output @xmath38 $ ] of the closed - loop network tracks the reference value ( in black - dash ) .",
    "the mean population of input species @xmath39 $ ] adapts automatically to changes in the reference value @xmath28 without requiring re - implementation .",
    "* d. * single - cell trajectories , although strongly affected by noise , still have an underlying regularity ensuring the convergence of the moments at the population level .",
    "all simulations have been performed using gillespie s stochastic simulation algorithm with the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    , @xmath44 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath46 , @xmath43 and @xmath45 for the antithetic integral controller and @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the hill - type static controller .",
    "the averaging is performed over 8000 cells simulated with gillespie s stochastic simulation algorithm . at @xmath50s , the value of @xmath51 jumps from 3 to 6 . while the proposed antithetic integral controller shows perfect adaptation , the hill - type static controller is unable to return to the mean value of the population of @xmath31 before the stimulus .",
    "this demonstrates the advantage of the integral feedback strategy over the hill - type strategy.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]      to those we would have obtained in the deterministic setting ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : det ] ) . to this aim",
    ", we again consider the gene expression network and we set @xmath52 for simplicity .",
    "we then get the deterministic model and stochastic mean model depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : det]-*a * and fig .",
    "[ fig : det]-*b * , respectively .",
    "the stochastic mean model has been obtained using the identity @xmath53=\\e[z_1]\\e[z_2]+\\textnormal{cov}(z_1,z_2)$ ] where the covariance term is nonzero as the random variables are not independent .",
    "if such a term would be zero , then we would recover the deterministic dynamics , but , due to noise , we can see in fig .  [",
    "fig : det]-*c * that while the deterministic dynamics may exhibit oscillations , the dynamics of the first - order moment is always globally converging to the desired steady - state value . as a final comment",
    ", we note that if we were closing the in fig .",
    "[ fig : det]-*c * by neglecting the second - order cumulant , then we would fail in predicting the correct behavior of the first - order moments .",
    "this demonstrates the central role of the noise in the stabilizing properties of the proposed stochastic integral controller .",
    "beyond endogenous circuits , our cybergenetic motif presents opportunities for applications in synthetic biology . until now",
    "most of the synthetic regulatory circuits have relied on proportional action  a control scheme that fails to ensure perfect adaptation in many practical situations . moreover",
    ", existing theoretical studies of synthetic biological circuits mainly considered the deterministic setting , and hence they implicitly assumed large molecular abundances .",
    "however , the implementation of control circuits that rely on high component abundances severely impinges on the host circuit s material and energy resources , leading to increased metabolic burden which can affect both function and viability .",
    "fortunately , this is largely avoidable , as effective control involves mostly information processing , which in principle requires little energy and material resource consumption .",
    "it can be used for both single - cell set - point tracking ( on average ) and for population control .",
    "thanks to the innocuousness of the controller , it does not need to be fine tuned , and can therefore be used in many practical situations , e.g. when the controlled network is very poorly known . in this regard ,",
    "the proposed controller maintains clear implementability advantages over controllers requiring parameter tuning .",
    "this latter property emerges from the random nature of the reactions , as its deterministic counterpart leads to oscillating trajectories when the controller parameters are located in a certain instability region . with this in mind",
    ", the proposed controller may find several applications within synthetic biology .",
    "an immediate one is the optimization of drug or fuel production in bioreactors ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "currently simple control strategies , such as proportional feedback or constitutive production , are used in these applications . by utilizing slightly more complex controllers , such as the one proposed here , dramatic improvements in the production process",
    "can be expected , thanks to their enhanced robustness properties .",
    "another important application example is the design of insulators ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it has indeed been shown that loading effects are often detrimental to modular design .",
    "insulators are therefore needed in order to preserve function modularity .",
    "the proposed controller can be used as a buffering element in order to drive the output of a module to the input of another one .",
    "it can also be used as a constant signal generator that can be used to act on a network to be analyzed .",
    "the amplitude can be tuned by acting on the reference , which can be modified from outside the cell using light - induced techniques @xcite .    the proposed controller , however , may have some drawbacks , as it seems to introduce some additional variance to the controlled process . even though this extra variance is not detrimental to the current control objectives",
    ", it may be a problem if goal is to reduce the variance over a cell population . whether the variance can be reduced via a more optimal choice of parameters or through controller reactions ,",
    "remains a question for further research . in the end",
    ", some variance may be unavoidable , as fundamental limitations to variance reduction with feedback @xcite are likely to hold for any molecular control circuit .",

    "<S> homeostasis is a running theme in biology . often achieved through feedback regulation strategies </S>",
    "<S> , homeostasis allows living cells to control their internal environment as a means for surviving changing and unfavourable environments . </S>",

    "<S> we lay the foundation for a regulation theory at the molecular level that explicitly takes into account the noisy nature of biochemical reactions and provides novel tools for the analysis and design of robust homeostatic circuits . using these ideas </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a new regulation motif , which we refer to as _ </S>",
    "<S> antithetic integral feedback _ , and demonstrate its effectiveness as a strategy for generically regulating a wide class of reaction networks . by combining tools from probability and control theory , we show that the proposed motif preserves the stability of the overall network , steers the population of any regulated species to a desired set point , and achieves robust perfect adaptation  all with low prior knowledge of reaction rates . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our proposed regulatory motif can be implemented using a very small number of molecules and hence has a negligible metabolic load . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , the regulatory motif exploits stochastic noise , leading to enhanced regulation in scenarios where noise - free implementations result in dysregulation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the possible manifestation of the proposed antithetic integral feedback motif in endogenous biological circuits and its realization in synthetic circuits .    </S>",
    "<S> perfect adaptation is that property of a biological system ( e.g. a cell ) which enables it to adapt to an external stimulus so that it maintains responsiveness to further stimuli . to be effective , </S>",
    "<S> such an adaptation mechanism must be robust , i.e. it must remain functional over a wide range of stimulus levels and system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in @xcite that robust perfect adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis is achieved due to integral feedback control in the prevalent chemotaxis model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other homeostatic systems have also been shown to realize integral feedback control . </S>",
    "<S> for example it was demonstrated in @xcite that calcium homeostasis in mammals relies on an integral feedback strategy to achieve perfect adaptation to persistent changes in plasma calcium clearance or influx , a property that enables mammals to maintain physiological levels of plasma calcium within tight tolerances in spite of varying demands for calcium . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> integral feedback was implicated in the robust regulation of membrane turgor pressure in saccharomyces cerevisiae . following an osmotic shock , nuclear enrichment of the map kinase </S>",
    "<S> hog1 adapts perfectly to changes in external osmolarity , a result of an integral feedback action that requires hog1 kinase activity . .        in engineering applications , </S>",
    "<S> integral feedback is recognized as a principal strategy for regulation . </S>",
    "<S> the proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) control architecture , which includes integral feedback as an essential element , is the workhorse of industrial control and is implemented in the majority of all automatic control applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> undoubtedly , the prevalence of such a control strategy in natural and man - made systems is due to the inherent property of integral feedback control to robustly steer a regulated system variable to a desired set point , while achieving perfect adaptation to disturbances ( or stimuli ) , regardless of the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps surprisingly , engineered biological circuits displaying perfect adaptation have received little attention so far , and current synthetic circuits only rely on simpler feedback strategies . </S>",
    "<S> for example , several control loops for controlling the level of biofuel production in bacteria while still maintaining a low toxicity level are theoretically analyzed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another synthetic negative feedback loop is also designed in @xcite for the control of protein translation . instead of integral feedback strategies , </S>",
    "<S> these circuits rely on the simpler proportional feedback strategy . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , they require a cumbersome tuning of parameters for achieving their goals . </S>",
    "<S> such a tuning is very difficult to realize in a biological setting , and even if a proportional feedback strategy is perfectly implemented , the absence of integral action implies that it does not possess the key property of perfect adaptation .    </S>",
    "<S> in the noise - free ( deterministic ) setting , integral feedback control is well - understood , and its ability to achieve robust set - point tracking and perfect adaptation is well - known @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , analogous strategies in intrinsically noisy cellular environments are unknown . indeed in biologically important settings </S>",
    "<S> where the dynamics is described by stochastic processes ( e.g. continuous - time discrete - state markov processes ) , determining what constitutes integral feedback remains unclear . </S>",
    "<S> as in the deterministic case , a  stochastic integral feedback \" strategy must achieve closed - loop stability of the overall system , robust set - point tracking and robust perfect adaptation . unlike the deterministic setting </S>",
    "<S> , however , set - point tracking and adaptation robustness must be maintained not only with respect to model parameters , but also for the highly fluctuating species abundances . </S>",
    "<S> one  stochastic integral feedback \" is to use statistical moments to describe the process to be regulated , and then to design feedback regulation strategies that steer these moments to desired values while achieving perfect adaptation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while this approach brings the problem back to the deterministic domain ( statistical moments evolve according to deterministic dynamics ) , one is immediately faced with the moment closure problem , whereby an infinite set of differential equations is needed to determine even the first two moments ; see e.g. @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar difficulties arise if one works with the chemical master equation ; see e.g. @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> here we adopt a novel approach for designing a stochastic integral feedback strategy that exhibits robust tracking and robust perfect adaptation . </S>",
    "<S> rather than dealing with the deterministic moments dynamics , we work with the stochastic chemical reaction network directly , thereby circumventing the moment closure problem . the objective of our control setup , represented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cloud ] , is to bring the population average of the species @xmath0 involved in a network ( the `` cloud '' in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cloud ] ) to a desired set - point . to achieve this , a new set of chemical reactions </S>",
    "<S> is introduced in a way that effectively implements a  </S>",
    "<S> stochastic antithetic integral feedback controller \" . </S>",
    "<S> this controller network consists of four reactions and two additional controller species ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) that can annihilate each other . </S>",
    "<S> the species @xmath1 actuates the network which , in turn , influences the production of @xmath2 through the output species @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show in the results section that , for a large class of networks , the steady - state value for the population average of @xmath0 depends exclusively on two of the controller parameters , and is independent of the network parameters . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> , the closed - loop network exhibits stability , robust set - point tracking , and robust perfect adaptation for @xmath0 . to analyze such stochastic systems and to guarantee that they achieve these objectives , </S>",
    "<S> a new theory is needed . </S>",
    "<S> we develop such a theory here and use it to show that for a large class of networks , the considered antithetic feedback control motif can be used to achieve the desirable properties of  stochastic integral feedback \" . </S>",
    "<S> we rigorously prove that such a motif robustly achieves the desired closed - loop stability ( ergodicity ) property . </S>",
    "<S> we additionally show that it achieves robust set - point tracking and robust perfect adaptation under mild conditions on the uncontrolled network . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , our  stochastic antithetic integral control motif \" can provably achieve all the desired properties mentioned above , even when very low molecular copy numbers exist anywhere in the network . </S>",
    "<S> this presents a clear advantage in synthetic biology applications , where synthetic control loops involving large molecular counts can impose a debilitating metabolic load on the cell . </S>",
    "<S> our control scheme can also be shown to possess remarkable stabilizing properties that are not found in deterministic implementations of the same circuit . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a clear example where the intrinsic stochastic noise is beneficial  </S>",
    "<S> it stabilizes a system which would otherwise be unstable . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> such a beneficial effect of noise , in the context of control theory , is reported here for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> note that many other benefits of noise , such as stochastic focusing @xcite , noise - induced oscillators @xcite and noise - induced switches @xcite , have appeared in the literature in recent years . </S>"
