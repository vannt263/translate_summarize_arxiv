    "a displacement process involving two fluids is often unstable when the displacing fluid has larger viscosity than the displaced one .",
    "the resulting instability developing at the interface between two fluids is known as viscous fingering @xcite .",
    "this instability has received much attention as an archetype of pattern - formation problems and as a limiting factor in the recovery of crude oil .",
    "classical mathematical model describing a newtonian flow displacement in a hele - shaw cell and development of the saffman ",
    "taylor instability consists of the continuity equation , darcy s law and a convection - diffusion equation for the concentration of the displacing fluid @xcite .",
    "the inertia of fluid may be important for high finger velocities .",
    "this leads to the necessity to use more complex nonlinear equations of fluid motion @xcite . in the framework of these models instability caused by different velocities of layers movement",
    "can be considered .",
    "there are several theoretical and experimental studies on the role of inertia in immiscible @xcite and miscible @xcite displacements .",
    "the results reveal that inertia tends to damping viscous fingering . in recent publications @xcite the effects of the thickness variation of a hele - shaw cell and elasticity of the walls on the process of viscous fingering",
    "have been studied .",
    "different types of instability in viscosity - stratified flow have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical , numerical , and experimental works devoted to understanding of various aspects of the instabilities is available in the literature @xcite .",
    "accurate numerical solution is costly at high peclet numbers and it is difficult to reproduce the detailed fingering pattern .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite show that it is simpler to describe the concentration of solute averaged across the fingers . in such cases ,",
    "the mixing zone is an important feature to determine the extent of mixing . despite the considerable work done",
    ", the spreading and growth of the mixing zone is an important question that still remains unresolved .",
    "several empirical models are available for the evaluation of mixing zones in unstable , miscible displacements .",
    "two empirical models have been suggested by koval @xcite and todd and longstaff @xcite to give a basis for computation of miscible displacement .",
    "both models suffer from adoption of empiricism in which the principal parameters involved have little or indirect physical significance .",
    "further development of averaged models of fingers formation is represented in @xcite .",
    "all these models are based on the hypothesis of pressure equalization in the transverse direction to the main flow , as well as an empirical information about the displacing and displaced fluids distribution in the region of intensive viscous fingering .",
    "let us recall that 2d numerical solution with high resolution is hard to construct , that is why 1d models play an important role in some cases .",
    "for instance , these models are very useful in calculating of fracturing when it is necessary to solve the equations of the crack opening and the fluid motion in the fracture simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to derive a hierarchy of mathematical models describing viscosity - stratified flow and spreading and growth of the mixing zone in a hele - shaw cell . in section 2",
    "we propose 2d nonlinear hyperbolic system of balance laws .",
    "in contrast with widespread model of flow displacement in a hele - shaw cell we apply nonlinear momentum equations and take into account compressibility of the fluid . at the same time diffusion coefficient",
    "is neglected that corresponds to the large peclet number limit . as we show in section 3 by numerical calculations ,",
    "this model is suitable for describing of jet flow and propagation of viscous fingers in a hele - shaw cell .",
    "we also point out that for the process of unidirectional displacement the pressure variation in the transverse direction is small .",
    "this observation makes it possible to use long - wave approximation and construct a class of layered flows described by a system of one - dimensional evolution equations .",
    "based on the various simplifications of the momentum equation ( linearisation , lubrication theory ) a hierarchy of 1d mathematical models is constructed in section 4 .",
    "the equations of a three - layer flow are studied and numerical computations of the formation of viscous fingers are performed in section 5 .",
    "we show that three - layer stationary flow is correctly described in the framework of simplified model .",
    "nevertheless the growth rate of viscous fingers is significantly higher than it is observed experimentally . in section 6",
    "we propose 1d kinematic - wave model of viscosity - stratified flow taking into account friction between the fluid layers .",
    "the velocity of propagation and the thickness of the viscous finger in the framework of this kinematic - wave model coincide with the corresponding calculations on the basis of the 2d equations .",
    "it gives possibility to predict the parameters of viscous fingers without time - consuming calculations .",
    "we also show that the proposed 1d model is in good agreement with the well - known koval model .",
