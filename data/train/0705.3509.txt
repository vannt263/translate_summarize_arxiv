    "against @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the quantity @xmath3",
    "is found to equal @xmath4 ( equation  [ eq_18 ] ) . ]",
    "barway & kembhavi ( 2007 ) have made the interesting claim that a combination of two photometric parameters , namely the effective radius @xmath5 and the mean effective surface brightness @xmath6 , can be used to predict supermassive black hole masses with a greater degree of accuracy than single quantities such as velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , luminosity ( graham 2007 and references therein ) or major - axis srsic index ( graham & driver 2007 ) .",
    "these latter relations have a total scatter in the @xmath0 direction of 0.310.34 dex .    here",
    "we check barway & kembhavi s ( 2007 ) claim that the total scatter in the @xmath0 direction , when using @xmath6 and @xmath1 as predictor quantities , is 0.25 dex ( and 0.19 dex when excluding the outlier ngc  4742 ) .",
    "a simple ordinary least squares regression analysis of @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 has been performed , in which @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the data for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 have been taken from table  1 in barway & kembhavi ( 2007 ) .",
    "in addition to solving for the parameter @xmath3 in the above inset equation , we also solve for @xmath12 and @xmath13 to give the expression @xmath14 given the absence of reported errors on the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 in barway & kembhavi ( 2007 ) , no attempt has been made to include such measurement errors in the regression , and subsequently no attempt to quantify the intrinsic scatter has been made .      upon the exclusion of ngc  4742 ,",
    "the optimal relation is @xmath16 and the scatter is reduced to 0.25 dex  which is the same level of scatter in the @xmath17@xmath18 relation upon the removal of two outliers ( graham & driver 2007 ) .",
    "this level of scatter is also equal to the value reported by marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) who also used a combination of two parameters ( @xmath5 and @xmath19 ) to predict @xmath17 .",
    "the low value of 0.19 dex reported by barway & kembhavi appears to have arisen by dividing the scatter in the @xmath1 direction ( 0.061 ) by the coefficient in front of the @xmath0 term in their equation  3 ( which is their fitted plane ) .",
    "this overlooks the three - dimensional nature of the plane and consequently results in the over - estimation of the plane s ability to predict black hole masses .",
    "an easy check is to compute the offset between the black hole masses listed in table  1 of barway & kembhavi and the values predicted from their plane ( their equation  3 ) , which can be re - written as @xmath20 doing so ( and excluding ngc  4742 ) the total rms scatter in the @xmath0 direction is 0.27 dex ( not 0.19 dex , and greater than the value of 0.25 dex obtained using the optimal plane constructed here ) .    in passing it",
    "is noted that three of the galaxies used by barway & kembhavi are known to be disc galaxies , or at least are not regular elliptical galaxies .",
    "m32 may likely be a stripped s0 galaxy ( e.g.  graham 2002 ) , while ngc 2778 is a disc galaxy ( e.g. rix , carollo & freeman 1999 ) , as is ngc 4564 ( trujillo et al .",
    "2004 ; see also figure  6 in graham & driver 2007 ) .",
    "consequently , the effective radii and mean surface brightnesses which have been used for these galaxies do not pertain to the bulge .",
    "curiously , excluding these three galaxies ( while including ngc  4742 ) , the rms scatter is 0.33 dex .",
