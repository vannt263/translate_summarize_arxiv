    "we will show that this picture changes considerably when the action of an interpolation of @xmath47 is used .",
    "we first interpolate the lattice spin variables to a finer lattice , by moving along geodesics on the sphere .",
    "the interpolation will be done locally , i.e. the interpolated fields within a plaquette @xmath62 of the @xmath15 lattice will only depend on the four spins associated with this plaquette , i.e. @xmath63 . the points of the finer lattice contained in the plaquette at @xmath32 , are @xmath64 , with @xmath65 and multiples of @xmath44 .",

    "now we can expand @xmath91 in @xmath93 and find that , @xmath94 using ( [ trick ] ) one finds , @xmath95)^2 + o(f / b).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , @xmath96 since it is not possible to prove that the @xmath43 terms are positive definite , we do not know how small an @xmath44 we need to be sufficiently close to the continuum bound .    in order to address this question , we considered the discretization of a continuum instanton configuration with unit topological charge given by @xcite , @xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "we take @xmath100 and @xmath101 to be real and define , @xmath102 the radius of the instanton is proportional to @xmath103 , while the center is located at @xmath104 , with @xmath105 .",
    "generically there is always a critical , @xmath106 , below which @xmath107 .",
    "we expect , and find numerically , that @xmath108 .",
    "we consider the center to be situated at the center of the volume to reduce finite volume effects . obviously , the continuum instanton is not periodic .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions by defining , @xmath109 where @xmath110 are coordinates on the infinite plane and @xmath111 are the coordinates on the lattice ( torus ) .",
    "@xmath112 is then the number of lattice sites .",
    "the connection between these two sets of coordinates is established through sterographic projection .",
    "this deformation of the infinite volume instanton is small if the instanton size is much smaller than @xmath113 . for such configurations",
    "therefore , the continuum action nearly saturates the bound . an alternative procedure would be to discretize the continuum instanton solutions of this model in a torus @xcite .",
    "figure 1 sumarizes our results .",
    "it represents the action of the discretized instanton configuration as the radius is varied .",
    "the continuous line corresponds to the standard action ( [ o3stan ] ) , while the dashed lines correspond to the improved action for different values of the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "it is clear that the standard action is problematic , since for @xmath114 the action is smaller than the continuum bound .",
    "for the new action however the situation is different . not only is the continuum bound satisfied , but also as the instanton is shrunk to sizes of @xmath20 , a small barrier develops , separating the @xmath115 and @xmath116 sectors .",
    "the existence of this barrier is easy to understand .",
    "the new action is the action of the instanton which has been first discretized on the @xmath15-lattice and then interpolated . for a large instanton ( compared to @xmath15 )",
    ", the interpolation should recover approximately the original configuration and so the action must be near that of a continuum instanton and show scale invariance . on the other hand , for an instanton of size @xmath117 a lot of information is lost in the discretization and the interpolation is not expected to give a configuration similar to the original continuum instanton . in general , the interpolation of small discretized instantons of @xmath20 will then be some other configuration that need not be even approximately an instanton , and consequently its action will be larger than the bound , since only instantons saturate the bound",
    ". thus the action must increase as we decrease @xmath118 near @xmath106 , as is clearly seen in fig .",
    "the other important point to notice is that the continuum bound ( [ o3bound ] ) is satisfied even for a ratio @xmath44 as large as @xmath119 .",
    "this indicates that the extra effort required to use the improved action is clearly managable in this case .",
    "we have presented a new action for non - abelian gauge theories which is better suited to studying topology on the lattice than the standard wilson action .",
    "the idea is to use the wilson action of an interpolation to a finer lattice of the original lattice configuration . in this way , if the ratio of lattice spacings is small enough , the continuum bound on configurations with non - zero topological charge is satisfied . in non - abelian gauge theories",
    "this is a sufficient condition for proper scaling of the topological susceptibility .",
    "we also considered a new action for the @xmath0 @xmath1-model in two dimensions along the same lines .",
    "a numerical study of discretized continuum instantons in this model indicates that already for a ratio of lattice spacings of @xmath119 , the continuum bound is satisfied .",
    "although the results for the @xmath0 model are very promising , a separate numerical analysis is needed in the yang - mills case to determine the ratio there .",
