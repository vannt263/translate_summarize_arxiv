    "a large number of hadronic @xmath3 decay events have been collected at the @xmath4 factories which enable us to make accurate measurements of branching fractions ( bfs ) and direct _ cp _ asymmetries for many modes . with the advent of the lhcb experiment , a tremendous amount of new experimental data on @xmath4 decays is expected to be obtained . in particular , various decay processes of heavier @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons as well as",
    "very rare @xmath4 decay modes are expected to be observed .    in earlier * * * * works on hadronic decays of @xmath4 mesons , the factorization hypothesis , based on the color transparency argument , was usually assumed to estimate the hadronic matrix elements which are inevitably involved in theoretical calculations of the decay amplitudes for these processes . under the factorization assumption ,",
    "the matrix element of a four - quark operator is expressed as a product of a decay constant and a form factor .",
    "naive factorization is simple but fails to describe color - suppressed modes .",
    "this is ascribed to the fact that color - suppressed decays receive sizable nonfactorizable contributions that have been neglected in naive factorization .",
    "another issue is that the decay amplitude under naive factorization is not truly physical because the renormalization scale and scheme dependence of the wilson coefficients @xmath7 are not compensated by that of the matrix element @xmath8 . in the improved ",
    "generalized factorization \" approach  @xcite , nonfactorizable effects are absorbed into the parameter @xmath9 , the effective number of colors .",
    "this parameter can be empirically determined from experiment .    with the advent of heavy quark effective theory ,",
    "nonleptonic @xmath4 decays can be analyzed systematically within the qcd framework .",
    "there are three popular approaches available in this regard : qcd factorization ( qcdf )  @xcite , perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite and soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite . in qcdf and scet , power corrections of order @xmath10",
    "are often plagued by the end - point divergence that in turn breaks the factorization theorem . as a consequence ,",
    "the estimate of power corrections is generally model dependent and can only be studied in a phenomenological way . in the pqcd approach ,",
    "the endpoint singularity is cured by including the parton s transverse momentum .    because a reliable evaluation of hadronic matrix elements is very difficult in general , an alternative approach which is essentially model independent",
    "is based on the diagrammatic approach  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the topological diagrams are classified according to the topologies of weak interactions with all strong interaction effects included .",
    "based on flavor su(3 ) symmetry , this model - independent analysis enables us to extract the topological amplitudes and sense the relative importance of different underlying decay mechanisms .",
    "when enough measurements are made with sufficient accuracy , we can extract the diagrammatic amplitudes from experiment and compare to theoretical estimates , especially checking whether there are any significant final - state interactions or whether the weak annihilation diagrams can be ignored as often asserted in the literature .",
    "the diagrammatic approach was applied to hadronic @xmath4 decays first in  @xcite .",
    "various topological amplitudes have been extracted from the data in  @xcite after making some reasonable approximations .    based on su(3 )",
    "flavor symmetry , the decay amplitudes also can be decomposed into linear combinations of the su(3)@xmath11 amplitudes which are su(3 ) reduced matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "this approach is equivalent to the diagrammatic approach when su(3 ) flavor symmetry is imposed to the latter .    in this work",
    "we make efforts to bridge these two different approaches , using qcdf and flavor su(3 ) symmetry , in @xmath0 decays . for this aim ,",
    "we first introduce all the relevant topological diagrams , including the presumably subleading diagrams , such as the qcd- and ew - penguin exchange ones and flavor - singlet weak annihilation ones , some of which turn out to be important especially in penguin - dominant decay processes",
    ". then all these decay modes are analyzed by using the _ intuitive _ topological diagrams and expressed in terms of the su(3)@xmath11 amplitudes .",
    "each su(3)@xmath11 amplitude is _ translated into _ the corresponding terms in the framework of qcdf . applying these relations",
    ", one can easily find the rather _ sophisticated _ results of the relevant decay amplitudes calculated in the qcdf framework .",
    "the magnitude and the strong phase of each su(3)@xmath11 amplitude are numerically estimated in qcdf .",
    "we further discuss some examples of the applications , including the effects of su(3)@xmath11 breaking and useful su(3)@xmath11 relations among decay amplitudes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce topological quark diagrams relevant to @xmath0 decays and the framework of qcdf .",
    "the explicit su(3)@xmath11 decomposition of the decay amplitudes and the relations between the su(3)@xmath11 amplitudes and the qcdf terms are presented . in sec .",

    "it should be stressed that these diagrams are classified according to the topologies of weak interactions with all strong interaction effects encoded , and hence they are _ not _ feynman graphs .",

    "in fact , @xmath395 arises from the different flavor operators @xmath399 and @xmath400 in qcdf .    for completeness , we present some useful su(3)@xmath11 relations among the decay amplitudes of @xmath401 which are not given in  @xcite . > from tables  [ b_pv_dels0_1]@xmath103[b_pv_dels1_3 ] and [ bs_pv_dels0_1]@xmath103[bs_pv_dels1_3 ]",

    "based on flavor su(3 ) symmetry , we have presented a model - independent analysis of @xmath0 decays . based on the topological diagrams , all the decay amplitudes of interest have been expressed in terms of the the su(3)@xmath11 amplitudes . in order to bridge the topological - diagram approach ( or the flavor su(3 ) analysis ) and the qcdf approach , we have explicitly shown how to translate each su(3)@xmath11 amplitude involved in these decay modes into the corresponding terms in the framework of qcdf .",
    "this is practically a way to easily find the rather _ sophisticated _ results of the relevant decay amplitudes calculated in qcdf by taking into account the simpler and more _ intuitive _ topological diagrams of relevance . for further quantitative discussions ,",
    "we have numerically computed each su(3)@xmath11 amplitude in qcdf and shown its magnitude and strong phase .    in our analysis",

    "we have also compared our results with those obtained from global fits to @xmath415 decays .",
    "certain results , such as the effects of @xmath416 for @xmath281 , are consistent with each other , but some other results , such as the contributions of @xmath295 and @xmath288 for @xmath415 , are different from each other . these differences stem mainly from the different ways of explaining the current data of @xmath281 , @xmath276 in these two approaches , depending on which su(3)@xmath11 amplitudes become more important in a particular mode .    as an example of the applications ,",
    "we have discussed the su(3)@xmath11 breaking effects .",
    "our results show that the su(3)@xmath11 breaking is up to 28% for the tree and color - suppressed tree amplitudes and",
