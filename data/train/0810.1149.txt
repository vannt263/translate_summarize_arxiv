    "stars arriving on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) are in an important evolutionary phase because they start to spin up getting free from their circumstellar disks which can begin to condensate giving rise to proto - planetary systems . at the same time , if they rotate fast enough , they can undergo a reduced effect of angular momentum lost organizing magnetic activity .",
    "in addition , young stars belonging to stellar kinematic groups ( skgs ) are important for a better understanding of the star formation history in the solar neighborhood . for these reasons , we consider mandatory to investigate the surface topology of magnetic active regions ( e.g. , photospheric spots and chromospheric plages ) on young stars possible members of skgs .",
    "thus , we selected stars with high lithium content and low rotational velocity ( @xmath1 km / s ) to be able to apply as photospheric diagnostics , besides the light - curve , the line - depth ratios ( ldrs ) .",
    "the use of contemporaneous light and temperature curves ( from ldrs ) allows us to derive spot temperature and size ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ; frasca et al .",
    "as chromospheric diagnostics , we analyzed the variability of h@xmath0 , helium , and calcium lines as already done for intermediate- and high - level active stars ( biazzo et al .",

    "2008 ) .    in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to the description of the stellar sample and the general outline of our project .",
    "moreover , we present some preliminary results for sao  51891 .",
    "in 2006 - 2007 we conducted a photometric and spectroscopic campaign to observe young late - type stars in the pms phase or just approaching the zams .",
    "our aim was to investigate the topology of their magnetic active regions at photospheric and chromospheric levels . in table  [ tab : star_sample ] we list the stellar sample and summarize the journal of spectroscopic and photometric observations conducted , respectively , with the high - resolution spectrographs foces@caha and sarg@tng , and with the photometer at oact and the ccd camera at tug .",
    "the columns list star name , year , period , number of nights , and observing site . for the spectroscopy",
    ", we also indicate the number of spectra .",
    "some of our targets ( namely sao  51891 , qt  and , and hd  285840 ) are part of the _ spitzer _ legacy program `` formation and evolution of planetary systems '' ( feps ; meyer et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is a comprehensive study of the evolution of gas and dust in the circumstellar environment of stars spanning a wide range of ages , from the pre - main sequence stage to the solar age .",
    "this makes the study of these stars even more interesting",

    "2002 , biazzo et al .",
    "2007a ) we were able to detect rotational modulation of the luminosity and the effective temperature .",
    "this allows us to study the stellar activity at photospheric level ( biazzo et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the hei - d3 , h@xmath0 , caii h&k , h@xmath4 , and caii irt lines , formed at different atmospheric levels , allow us to analyze the chromospheric emission by means of the spectral subtraction technique ( e.g. , frasca et al .",
    "figures  [ fig : spectra_hd171488 ] , [ fig : spectra_sao108142 ] show portions of spectrum of hd  171488 and sao  108142 in the h@xmath0 , and caii irt spectral regions , with the non - active template superimposed .",
    "the h@xmath0 and the caii irt profiles are filled - in by emission , with the latter displaying a central reversal ( very clear in sao  108142 ) and suggesting a contribution to the total chromospheric losses ( bus et al . 2007 ) .",
    "from our photometric and spectroscopic observations we are going to study the distribution of inhomogeneities at photospheric and chromospheric levels in a sample of young stars .",
    "then , we are also developing a spot / plage model to reproduce the data deriving the main spot parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and obtaining information about the chromospheric plages ( flux contrast and filling factor ) .",
    "our spot / plage model applied to sao  51891 ( biazzo et al .",
    "2008 ) points towards bigger and warmer spots ( @xmath2 closer to the photospheric temperature value ) compared to wildly - active main - sequence stars ( biazzo et al .",
    "we are currently refining our spot / plage model and planning to observe our targets in other epochs in order to draw firmer conclusions .",
    "this study will contribute to explore the relationships between global stellar parameters ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , [ fe / h ] , age ) and spot / plage properties in stars with different activity level and evolutionary stage .",
