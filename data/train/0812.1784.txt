    "back - to - back correlations ( bbc ) of particle - antiparticle pairs , also called hadronic squeezed correlations , were predicted to exist if their masses were modified in the hot and dense medium formed in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the formalism corresponding to the bosonic case was developed in ref.@xcite . shortly after that",
    ", similar correlations were shown to exist among fermion - antifermion pairs with in - medium modified masses@xcite , and they were treated by an analogous formalisms . however , in contrast to what is observed in quantum statistical correlations of identical hadrons ( the hbt effect ) , where bosons with similar momenta have positive correlations , while fermions with similar momenta are anti - correlated , the fermionic ( fbbc ) and the bosonic ( bbbc ) back - to - back correlations are both positive correlations with unlimited intensity .",
    "the similarities of the fbbc and the bbbc curves were illustrated in fig . 1 of ref.@xcite , where squeezed correlations of two @xmath3-mesons and of @xmath4 were chosen as illustration .",
    "in what follows , we will focus our discussion in the bosonic case , illustrating the effect by considering @xmath5 pairs , and also introducing some results on @xmath1 pairs . in the case of @xmath3-mesons ( which are their own antiparticles ) with in - medium modified masses , the joint probability for observing two such particles , i.e. , the two - particle distribution ,",

    "the first term corresponds to the product of the spectra of the two @xmath3 s , @xmath7 , being @xmath8 and @xmath9 the free - particle creation and annihilation operators of the scalar quanta , and @xmath10 means thermal averages .",
    "the second term contains the identical particle contribution which , together with the first term , gives rise to the femtoscopic ( or hanbury - brown & twiss ) effect , and is represented by the square modulus of the so - called chaotic amplitude , @xmath11 .",
    "the third term , when written as the square modulus of the squeezed amplitude , @xmath12 , is identically zero in the absence of in - medium mass - shift .",
    "however , if the masses of the particles are modified , it gives rise to the squeezed correlation function , together with the first term . in summary , in terms of these amplitudes ,",
    "the @xmath5 correlation function can be written as @xmath13 the first two terms corresponding to the identical particle ( hbt ) correlation , whereas the first and the last terms represent the correlation function between the particle and its antiparticle , i.e. , the squeezed part . in the case of charged mesons , as in the @xmath1 , only the first and the last terms contribute to the squeezed correlation , if their masses change .    in the definition of the amplitudes @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the asymptotic , observed bosons with momentum @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , is related to the in - medium annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , corresponding to thermalized quasi - particles , by the bogoliubov - valatin transformation , @xmath21 .",

    "the argument , @xmath24 , is called _ squeezing parameter _ , since the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ bogovalan ] ) is equivalent to a squeezing operation .",
    "the in - medium modified mass , @xmath25 , is related to the asymptotic mass , @xmath26 , by @xmath27 .",
    "although in the general case @xmath25 could be momentum - dependent , it is here assumed to be a constant mass - shift . for a hydrodynamical ensemble , both the chaotic and the squeezed amplitudes , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ,",
    "can be written in a special form derived in @xcite , and developed in @xcite .",
    "the formulation for both bosons and fermions was initially derived for a static , infinite medium @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown@xcite in the bosonic case that , even for finite - size systems expanding with moderate flow , the squeezed correlation may survive with sizable strength to be observed experimentally .",
    "similar behavior is expected in the fermionic case . in that analysis , a non - relativistic treatment with flow - independent squeezing parameter",
    "was adopted for the sake of simplicity , which allowed for obtaining analytical results .",
    "the detailed discussion is in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the maximum value of @xmath30 , was studied as a function of the modified mass , @xmath25 , considering pairs with exact back - to - back momenta , @xmath31 .",
    "this type of analysis represents an analogous procedure as to studying only the intercept parameter of the hbt correlation function .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ corrphi](a ) , which shows the variation of the maximum of the squeezed correlation in the absence of flow , in three parts .",
    "the top and middle plots are results of a recent simulation , where the momenta of each particle in the pair is generated , the squeezed correlation is then estimated and the bins are filled . the bottom plot is obtained by attributing precise values to the variables , then calculating @xmath32 .",
    "this shows that the simulation is indeed reproducing the calculation , for small bin sizes .",
    "we can also see from fig .",
    "[ corrphi](a ) that the simulation shows practically no sensitivity to the cuts introduced in the momentum generation , in order to mimic the experimental cuts in @xmath33 , @xmath34 , azimuthal angle , etc@xcite .",
    "although this study illustrated many points of theoretical interest , it was not helpful for motivating the experimental search of the bbc s , since the modified mass is not accessible to direct measurement .    , and of the back - to - back momentum of each particle , for a static medium ( @xmath35 ) ) . in ( b )",

    "within the non - relativistic approach of @xcite , we suggest to combine the particle - antiparticle momenta , @xmath39 , into the pair average momentum , @xmath40 , and analyze the squeezed correlation function in terms of @xmath41 , similarly to what is done in hbt interferometry .",
    "the maximum of the bbc effect is reached when @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the squeezed correlation should be investigated as @xmath44 , around the zero of the average momentum . for simplicity , we analyze here the behavior of the correlation function , detailed in @xcite , by attributing values to @xmath41 and @xmath45 , as shown in fig .",

    "we can see that the size of the squeezing region is reflected in the inverse width of the curves plotted as function of @xmath59 .",

    "a four - momentum variable can be constructed , as @xmath61 , as introduced in ref .",
    "moreover , it would be preferable to redefine this variable as @xmath62 , because its non - relativistic limit recovers @xmath63 .",

    "we discussed here some of the main results on the squeezed correlations , within an a non - relativistic approach developed earlier .",
    "we suggest an effective way to search for it in heavy ion collisions at rhic , emphasizing the need for experimentally observe this signal .",
    "this should be done by plotting the hadronic squeezed correlations in terms of the average momentum of the pair , @xmath65 , which is the non - relativistic limit of the four - vector @xmath66 .",
    "we showed some results that would be expected in the case of @xmath5 back - to - back correlations , as well in the case of the @xmath1 pairs .",
    "we also illustrated the effects of finite system sizes , finite times and flow .",
    "we could see that finite emission times reduce the signal substantially , and that , in the presence of flow , the signal is stronger over the momentum regions in the plots , i.e. , roughly for @xmath67 mev / c and @xmath68 mev / c , suggesting that flow may enhance the chances of observing the bbc signal .",
    "we also saw that the correlation function reflects the size of the region where the squeezing occurred .",
    "finally , we should emphasize that the absence of squeezing , i.e. , if there is no in - medium mass modification , the squeezed correlation functions would be unity for all values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
