    "most of the problems in physics and engineering are usually expressed in the form of partial differential equations which are often too complicated to be solved analytically . even if one may obtain the exact solution of some problems it involves much tedious calculations or it is difficult to interpret the solutions .",
    "the struggle to overcome this difficulty led to the invention of different approximate analytical methods , such as , adomian decomposition method ( adm ) @xcite , homotopy analysis method ( ham ) @xcite , variational iteration method ( vim ) @xcite , the new iterative method ( nim ) @xcite and differential transform method ( dtm ) @xcite etc .",
    "the dtm was first introduced by zhou@xcite in 1986 for solving linear and non - linear initial value problems in electrical circuit analysis .",
    "the method has been extensively used by researchers to solve linear and non - linear ordinary differential equations @xcite . in 1999 , chen an ho @xcite extended this method to two dimensional differential transform method for solving the partial differential and integral equations .",
    "this method has been used for solving linear and non linear goursat problem @xcite , for linear partial differential equations of factorial order @xcite , for solving system of differential equations @xcite and for differential - algebraic equations @xcite .",
    "the laplace equation is the best model to study most of the problems of different branches of physics and mechanics , for example , heat and mass transfer , fluid mechanics , elasticity and electrostatics .",
    "the two dimensional laplace equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is laplacian , is usually considered with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the laplace equation has already been examined using several iterative methods such as the new iterative method @xcite , homotopy analysis method @xcite , adomian decomposition method @xcite and variational iteration method @xcite .",
    "the purpose of present paper is to apply two dimensional dtm to four models of laplace equation , two with dirichlet and two with neumann boundary conditions . in each case",
    ", this method constructs one analytic solution without requiring liberalization or discretization .",
    "another important advantage of dtm is simplicity in its algorithm .",
    "moreover , it greatly reduces the size of computational work compared with the existing iterative methods and provide accurate series solution with rapid convergence . in next section , we present two dimensional differential transform method @xcite .",
    "consider a function of two variables @xmath2 and suppose that it can be represented as a product of two single - variable functions , i.e. , @xmath3 . based on the properties of one - dimensional differential transform ,",

    "then the differential inverse transform of @xmath8 is defined as follows @xmath9    the lower case @xmath2 represents the original function while the uppercase @xmath8 stands for the transformed function . combining eq.([1 ] ) and eq.([2.2 ] ) , it can be obtained that @xmath10(x - x_{0})^{m}(y - y_{0})^{n}\\ ] ] on the basis of above definition we have following fundamental results of two dimensional differential transform ( see @xcite )    [ 2.1 ] suppose that @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the differential transforms of the functions @xmath2 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively at @xmath15 , then it follows that    a.   if @xmath16 , then @xmath17 + b.   if @xmath18 , then @xmath19 + c.",
