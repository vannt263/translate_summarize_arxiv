    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) have long been the primary method of understanding stars .",
    "colour  magnitude diagrams , which can be quickly made from photometric data , enable one to explore various facets of stellar populations , such as stellar mass and evolutioanry state . however , these does not present the information at its most basic physical level : the stellar temperature and luminosity .",
    "these represent the fundamental ideals of stellar modelling , and are theoretically free from biases introduced by photometric calibration , interstellar reddening and similar phenomena .",
    "while transformations to these parameters can be achieved through colour  temperature relations and bolometric corrections , these are limited in scope .",
    "most importantly , the wavelength coverage of the observations means that well - defined solutions do not always exist for these relations ( e.g. for very red stars , or for observations only covering wavelengths longer than the sed peak ) .",
    "using the entire wavelength coverage available allows better determination of stellar temperature when a wide temperature range is present among a stellar sample .",
    "this also allows finer control of data quality .",
    "all - sky surveys are , in particular , prone to contain some poor - quality data due to the large flux range they are required to cover , which leads to the saturation of bright sources , and the volume of data , which limits the ability to match photometric routines to particular situations ( e.g.  in areas of high stellar density or nebular emission ) .",
    "stellar variability can also cause improper colours to be reported , which can be reduced by using multiple epochs or , equivalently , multi - wavelength data . in this manner",
    ", we can provide more - robust estimates of parameters for individual objects , allowing them to be placed on the true , physical hertzsprung ",
    "russell ( h  r ) diagram .",
    "perhaps the greatest benefit , however , is the ability to detect excess flux at a particular wavelength , by providing a reference model flux against which fluxes in individual photometric filters can be compared .",
    "this is particularly helpful in the infrared , where colour  magnitude diagrams based on only part of the sed can fail to identify sources exhibiting emission in addition to the stellar photosphere .",
    "predominantly , these sources are either very young stars ( pre - main - sequence t tauri stars or herbig ae / be stars ) , rapid rotators ( classical be stars ) , or evolved stars . this latter group is mostly comprised of mass - losing red and asymptotic giant branch ( rgb / agb ) stars , on which we focus our discussion .",
    "previously , only colour  magnitude diagrams have been used to interpret our closest stellar neighbours ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we are now able to take the data returned by the _ hipparcos _",
    "satellite @xcite and match it with other all - sky surveys to produce a true h ",

    ", we can identify and characterise stars with weak infrared excesses which may be otherwise missed by conventional colour cuts . while this has been attempted previously ( @xcite ; we later discuss these papers in context ) , this work represents the first time such a process has been applied to the entire _ hipparcos _ dataset and in the context of the stars absolute , fundamental parameters .",

    "the resulting initial input catalogue contains 109661 _ hipparcos _ stars with data from @xmath29-band to 25 @xmath1 m .",
    "the source statistics for this combined catalogue are listed in table [ catstable ] .",
    "the seds were fitted using the code initially described in @xcite and modified in the subsequent papers @xcite .",
    "this code , hereafter referred to as getsed , is optimised to detect low - contrast infrared excess arising from circumstellar dust .",
    "we have made some further revisions to the code as detailed below .",
    "getsed works by minimising the @xmath35 statistic between the observed photometric data and a set of synthetic stellar spectra to determine stellar temperature and luminosity .",
    "this requires user - defined stellar mass , metallicity and distance , and an interstellar reddening , and given appropriate filter transmission curves .",
    "a grid of temperatures between 2400 and 60000 k is set up , in steps of 400 k. blackbodies of these temperatures are fit to the dereddened photometric data and the model with the lowest @xmath35 chosen .",
    "a finer grid is set up and the blackbody temperature is iterated to the nearest 25 k. this temperature is then used to derive the stellar luminosity and surface gravity to first order .    for this work , we do not know the mass or metallicity of our stars , which are required to select the correct set of synthetic spectra . nor do we know the interstellar reddening toward the stars .",
    "we assume that the metallicity is solar and that the interstellar reddening is zero .",
    "an assumption of solar metallicity is reasonable for nearby galactic stars : the true values scatter around the solar value of [ z / h ] @xcite , with the scatter imparting a @xmath363% error to the temperature fit for the majority of stars .",
    "the magnitude of this error is similar to that imparted by good - quality photometry .",
    "a larger error is imparted by interstellar reddening , which makes the star appear dimmer and cooler than it actually is .",
    "this can be significant in the case of distant objects , or those in the galactic plane . in practice ,",
    "stars which suffer from significant interstellar extinction tend to be the brighter giant stars , which also suffer from significant parallax errors .",
    "bright giants are often subject to radial pulsations .",
    "these can change the fractional contribution of cool and hot spots on the stellar surface to the star s total light , leading to changes in the astrometric centre of light .",
    "these can impart substantial parallax errors @xcite , which can be sufficiently large that extinction is not the primary source of error in the placement of these stars on the h ",
    "r diagram .",
    "as we do not know the mass of individual stars , we estimate it from the best - fit blackbody temperature and luminosity .",
    "as this only affects the stellar gravity , which has a minimal effect on the overall sed , we need only to approximate the actual mass .",
    "we estimate the stellar mass by assuming each star is either a main - sequence star or a giant .",
    "giants are determined to be stars with : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the determined effective temperature in kelvin and @xmath39 is the determined luminosity in solar units .    for main - sequence stars ,",
    "we use a mass  temperature relation based on a solar - metallicity , zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) isochrone @xcite . we can not estimate the mass of giant stars so easily .",
    "most stars below the rgb tip ( @xmath40 l@xmath0 ) will be the more - numerous , older stars of @xmath31 m@xmath0 .",
    "more massive giants survive to much higher luminosities on the agb , thus we expect very luminous giants to be considerably more massive . based on the aforementioned isochrones @xcite , we assume a mass for the giant stars of @xmath41 , with limits placed at 1 and 20 m@xmath0 .",
    "the first - order determination of temperature , luminosity and stellar gravity ( from the black - body fit ) , are used as the initial parameters for our synthetic spectra .",
    "previously , we have used the marcs model atmospheres @xcite described in @xcite . for this work",
    ", however , we instead use the bt - settl models of @xcite , as the temperature spacing of the grid models is finer in the 40006000 k region .",
    "we have found this to reduce artifacts caused by interpolation between grid points for stars with poor - quality photometry .",
    "getsed takes the model spectra grid and performs a linear interpolation in temperature and surface gravity ( and metallicity , if required ) .",
    "the synthetic spectrum is convolved with the observed filter transmissions and reduced to a set of expected photometric fluxes .",
    "these are then normalised to the observed photometric fluxes ( the constant of normalisation determining the luminosity ) and a @xmath35 is determined .",
    "this process is first performed on the temperature gridpoint immediately cooler than the blackbody temperature .",
    "getsed then calculates the @xmath35 for the neighbouring temperature gridpoints and continues until a @xmath35 minimum is detected .",
    "the temperature corresponding to the @xmath35 minimum is used as a new starting point , a new surface gravity is calculated , and @xmath35 is determined for 128 k steps between the neighbouring models . a new @xmath35 minimum is determined , the temperature step is halved , and the process re - run until the temperature is fit to within 1 k. the calculated stellar effective temperature , luminosity , surface gravity and model photometric fluxes are written to disk .    as with our previous uses of this code , we have only fit photometric data with short wavelengths ( here we require @xmath42 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "circumstellar dust will still cause some opacity in the optical , but the obscuration must be relatively small for it to have been observed with _",
    "hipparcos _ , and absorption of optical flux is relatively easy to identify when it is re - radiated in the infrared .",
    "stars which are heavily extincted will have seds that become double - peaked . in these cases , getsed will not be able to fit a model spectrum to it",
    ". the most - extincted stars ( e.g.  irc+10216 ; @xcite ) may be sufficiently optically obscured that they do not feature in the _ hipparcos _ catalogue ( cf .",
    "this becomes important in the removal of bad data ( see section [ badsect ] ) and we remind the reader that our h ",
    "r diagram is therefore incomplete , even at high luminosity .",
    "each star now has a series of photometric datapoints for which an observed and a modelled flux is known .",
    "the ratio ( @xmath43 ) of observed / modelled flux therefore gives the excess or deficit flux in that band .",
    "we give this as a pure ratio , rather than in terms of an @xmath44-based excess , as we do not include the errors in the photometric data in our model . while this may appear surprising , the reported errors on photometric data are almost invariably much lower than the absolute error between catalogues .",
    "such ` bad ' data can be incorporated into the sed for several intrinsic and extrinsic reasons , including ( in approximate order of overall severity ) :    = 1em    poor - quality raw data , e.g.  saturated images or unflagged cosmic rays ;    blending , particularly among catalogues which have integrated fluxes over different areas ( e.g.  the point - spread function of _ hipparcos _ is a very different size to that of _ iras _ ) , affecting binary and multiple stars , and objects which are in the same line of sight as background objects with very red colours ( e.g.  redshifted galaxies in infrared surveys ) ;    poor background subtraction , which mainly affects infrared observations of sources at low galactic latitudes or in other regions of nebulosity ;    intrinsic variability among stars ;    inaccurate source matching due to large proper motions ;    the accuracy of photometric corrections to each survey s base photometric system .",
    "the issues become particularly problematic when comparing optical and mid - infrared catalogues : in the mid - infrared stars typically present fainter detections compared to higher backgrounds , and beam sizes are typically larger ( hence include more objects ) .",
    "additional errors come from the model parameters which arise from our assumption that stars have solar metallicity , a given stellar mass and no interstellar extinction . bearing this in mind",
    ", we have assumed that each photometric point has an arbitrary absolute error of 10% and computed a @xmath35-based goodness - of - fit measure based on this uncertainty",
    ". we also do not give error estimates for our temperatures and luminosities , as they would essentially be meaningless .",
    "the bad data in our combined multi - wavelength catalogue is mostly of sources which have saturated in the various input survey catalogues .",
    "the _ wise _ catalogue , in particular , suffers from saturation .",
    "some photometry flagged as good does not match detections in other bands ( e.g.  hip24436 has @xmath25 = 1.987 @xmath45 0.009 mag , while @xmath46 = 0.739 , 0.001 and 0.030 mag ) .",
    "conversely , some photometry flagged as uncertain does not decrease the goodness - of - fit of the model seds and is therefore sufficiently accurate for the purpose of identifying infrared excess .",
    "we have so far included all _ wise _ data , regardless of its uncertainty and we must now remove the points we believe to be in error .    unfortunately , this is a particularly recalcitrant dataset to remove bad data from : we wish to keep points which fit badly due to intrinsic variability ( as these will , on average , cancel out across the sed ) , but remove datapoints which have incorrect fluxes .",
    "we have opted to apply a number of sequential cuts to remove bad quality data . since altering one band",
    "affects the model fit of the others , we must carefully design these cuts to minimise errant removal of good quality data . at each step , we have visually examined the seds of the objects with the worst - fitting models and devised a cut which removes the dominant contribution of bad data .",
    "the removed data was examined and the cut applied if it did not remove any plausibly accurate data .",
    "the details of these cuts are given in the appendix .",
    "while these cuts have not removed every single bad data point , they have removed the vast majority of bad data , providing a much cleaner data set with which we can work .",
    "this has sadly meant removing stars where there was not sufficient data to provide a robust fit , meaning the original _ hipparcos _ catalogue has been reduced from 117956 to 107619 objects .      now that we have removed bad data from our catalogue , we can calculate the amount of infrared excess present for each star .",
    "having already performed sed fitting , creating a measure of infrared excess becomes a trivial exercise in comparing the fitted model with observations . providing the best metric(s ) to quantify infrared excess",
    "is more difficult .",
    "we adopt two techniques .",
    "our first metric simply takes the ratio of observed to sed - modelled flux of all the data longward of 2.2 @xmath1 m ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , and averages them together .",
    "this provides a single number ( @xmath51 ) that describes the average excess in the 325 @xmath1 m region , relative to the underlying photospheric model , which can be described mathematically as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the observed and modelled fluxes at frequency @xmath55 ( corresponding to wavelength @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 is the number of observations at wavelengths @xmath582.2 @xmath1 m .",
    "our second metric assumes that the infrared excess is due to reprocessed stellar light ( i.e.  ignoring background infrared emission and foreground circumstellar extinction ) .",
    "we approximate the amount of reprocessed light as being the integrated observed flux or @xmath59 . ]",
    "longward of 2.2 @xmath1 m , minus the integrated model flux over the same region .",
    "we can take this as a fraction of the underlying stellar flux , under the assumption that the total energy output ( in jy ) of the star is not affected by circumstellar reprocessing of light .",
    "mathematically , we can then define the fraction of stellar light reprocessed into the infrared ( @xmath60 ) as : @xmath61 we also define a wavelength , @xmath62 , as where @xmath63 reaches a peak .",
    "the precision with which we can define @xmath62 depends strongly on the amount of available data .",
    "we are now in a position to list our data in a master catalogue containing the fundamental parameters of the _ hipparcos _ stars .",
    "we do so in table [ hrdtable ] , which lists :    = 1em    column 1 : the _ hipparcos _ identifier for the object ;    columns 2 & 3 : the co - ordainates of the object ;    columns 4 & 5 : the parallax distance to the object and its associated fractional error ;    column 6 : the modelled effective temperature of the object ;    column 7 : the modelled luminosity of the object ;    columns 8 & 9 : the shortest and longest wavelength for which we have data ;    columns 1030 : the ratio of the observed to modelled flux at each wavelength , such that unity represents a perfect match to the model ;    column 31 : @xmath64 , the number of observations at @xmath65 m ;    column 32 : @xmath51 , the average excess at those wavelengths , as defined above ;    column 33 : @xmath60 , the fraction of the object s luminosity reprocessed into the infrared , as defined above ;    column 34 : @xmath62 , the wavelength at which the infrared excess reaches a peak , as defined above .",

    "the apparent infrared excess in this case is likely due to source blending and confusion , coupled with poor - quality short - wavelength photometry .",
    "68 uma : this star is mistakenly classified as excessive due to a mismatch between the _ hipparcos / tycho _ magnitudes and those from the sdss , which differ by approximately a magnitude , despite no variability being detected by _",
    "hipparcos_. this has lead to an excess being determined incorrectly . by using a variety of combinations of photometry",
    ", we estimate that a correct temperature and luminosity of around 4000 k and 400 l@xmath0 would me more appropriate for this source , and that it has no substantial reddening .",
    "hr 5464 : the determination of infrared excess for this star is based solely on _ iras _ data , in which excess is relatively weak ( 86% at 12 @xmath1 m , 50% at 25",
    "@xmath1 m ) .",
    "_ dirbe _ data suggest there is little or no infrared excess for this source .",
    "bd peg : a known mass - losing star , @xcite note that silicate emission is present in this object and @xcite confirm its infrared excess .    with the exception of the carbon star tz car",
    ", we therefore find no detectable dust production by any object below the luminosity of ru crt ( 681 l@xmath0 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that this represents the luminosity at which dust production by agb stars begins in earnest in the local neighbourhood .",
    "this corroborates very well with the @xmath5700 l@xmath0 we have previously found in galactic globular clusters @xcite .",
    "we now turn our attention to the work of @xcite .",
    "this paper identifies several low - luminosity _ hipparcos _ stars with infrared excess which groenewegen attributes to weak dust emission .",
    "these stars have much lower lumionsities ( 50350 l@xmath0 ) than those we find excess around , as groenewegen was examining rgb stars for dust excesses much smaller than we have deemed accurately determinable in this work .",
    "the stars from @xcite which have survived our data quality cuts are shown on figure [ giantxsfig ] .",
    "groenewegen purposely targetted stars with low ( @xmath77 ) colours , thus his sample does not include stars from with high values of @xmath51 .",
    "it is notable , however , that all 52 stars common to our datasets lie within the scatter of points with no unusual infrared excess .",
    "also , groenewegen s dusty stars appear to have no more infrared excess than his dustless stars .",
    "the reasons behind this are not immediately obvious , but can be understood by examining the subtle differences between our analyses .",
    "the most striking of these is the choice of input data .",
    "we have included data from _ wise _ , _ akari _ ( 9 and 18 @xmath1 m ) and _ iras _ ( 12 and 25 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "groenewegen includes data from _ akari _ ( including the far - infrared 60- and 90-@xmath1 m fis bands ) and _ iras _ ( including the far - infrared 60- and 100-@xmath1 m bands ) .",
    "the choice of whether or not to include the far - infrared data is a balance of gaining sensitivity to cold dust and acquiring systematic errors due to contamination in the line of sight .",
    "the issue with the _ akari _ fis and _ iras _ data we have excluded is the beam size ( 37@xmath2 and 39@xmath2 for _ akari _ fis 60 and 100 @xmath1 m , respectively ; @xmath78 for _ iras _",
    "12@xmath1 m ; @xcite ) .",
    "these are much larger than the beam sizes for the other infrared data ( 5.6@xmath2 for _ akari _ irc 8.6 @xmath1 m ; @xmath79 for _ wise _",
    "11.6@xmath1 m ) and much larger than the optical photometry ( typically 12@xmath2 ) .",
    "a large point - spread function full - width half - maximum ( psf fwhm ) means there is a substantial issue with contamination from unrelated sources in the line of sight , from diffuse background emission , or from ism headed by the star .",
    "equally , if a giant star has a spatially - extended wind , this may be missed by only considering data with a small psf .",
    "groenewegen has been careful to exclude sources with strong cirrus contamination , which is the main contaminant in the _ iras _ photometry . however , his exclusions are based on the 100-@xmath1 m images , whereas ecliptic dust is a greater contaminant at 25 and 60 @xmath1 m .",
    "these sources would therefore not be identified as contaminated .",
    "on examining the individual stars which @xcite claims are dusty , we find that the comparatively - large psf size of _ iras _ and ( in some cases ) _ akari _ fis appears the primary cause of the difference between our datasets . typically , the _ iras _ 12- and 25-@xmath1 m flux is systematically in excess of the modelled stellar photosphere compared to the smaller - psf _ akari _ irc and _ wise _ photometry . as an example , we model hip 44126 ( fz cnc ) to have moderate excess in _ iras _ ( 52% and 35% at 12 and 25",
    "@xmath1 m ) , but little excess in _ wise _ ( 8% and 6% at 11.6 and 22.1 @xmath1 m ) . by only taking the _ iras _ data , groenewegen naturally models this star as having reasonable infrared excess . in this particular",
    "instance , the contaminating source can be clearly identified as poorly - subtracted emission from warm dust in the ecliptic plane in the original _ iras _ photometry .",
    "the same is true of hip 53449 , though here is the _ akari _ fis data that suffers from contamination from the ecliptic .",
    "not all of groenewegen s dusty sources can be explained so easily , however .",
    "hip 67605 and 67665 ( aw cvn ) are both identified as dusty by @xcite .",
    "they lie quite close to each other ( 15@xmath80 apart ) but are resolved in the _ iras _ images by several beam widths .",
    "they do not suffer from substantial contamination .",
    "they are covered by _",
    "akari _ and _ iras _ , but not the _ wise _ preliminary catalogue .",
    "both sources have excess at _ iras _ 12 and 25 @xmath1 m but not _ akari _ 9 and 18 @xmath1 m . like the majority of groenewegen s targets ,",
    "these stars lie at around 200 pc . at this distance",
    "the _ akari _",
    "8.6-@xmath1 m psf has a fwhm of 1120 au , or 20004000 stellar radii . assuming the dust temperature approximately follows a @xmath81 law , and a stellar temperature of @xmath53700 k , this implies that dust falling within",
    "the _ iras _ beam but outwith the _ akari _ irc beam should emit with a peak wavelength of @xmath82 @xmath1 m",
    ". it should therefore not emit significantly at 818 @xmath1 m to cause the discrepency between the _ akari _ nir and _ iras _",
    "12-@xmath1 m fluxes .    nevertheless , the infrared excess groenewegen finds may still be real , and still be related to a wind eminating from the star .",
    "two situations may cause this .",
    "the first case is that a cooler , detached shell surrounds the star and emits only at longer ( 60100 @xmath1 m ) wavelengths ( cf .",
    "y cvn ; @xcite ) . in the second case",
    ", the emission would be produced not by the star , but instead interstellar dust swept up in a bow shock around the astropause @xcite .",
    "this has been seen in other nearby agb stars @xcite and could be the source of the excess emission at longer ( 60100 @xmath1 m ) wavelengths that groenewegen finds in several cases .",
    "we also acknowledge that variability may also play a rle in this analysis .",
    "neither groenewegen s nor our determinations of infrared excess take into account the variability of stars .",
    "as @xcite uses some different optical data to us , we may find that some stars in both studies appear to have infrared excess simply because their optical photometry was observed when the star was at photometric minimum .",
    "conversely , excess may be missed if observations were carried out at photometric maximum .",
    "@xcite and this work probe subtly different datasets with subtly different techniques .",
    "it should therefore not be surprising that we find different results , though we would argue that our analysis should be better suited to finding ongoing dust production by stars .",
    "on the basis of the above discussion , we advise caution when investigating small infrared excesses in such cases and note the benefits of phase - matched , high - resolution infrared photometry ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in this work , we have demonstrated the use of spectral energy distribution fitting to determine the fundamental parameters of the _ hipparcos _ star sample .",
    "we have further used this information to quantify excess flux over the entire optical , and near- and mid - infrared region of each sed .",
    "we have combined these excesses to determine those stars showing an excess of infrared flux , and cross - correlated literature identifications to examine the cause of that excess over different regions of the h ",
    "r diagram , comparing our results to the key studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find we can not reproduce the infrared excess and dust production claimed by the latter paper .",
    "our analysis has focussed on the _ hipparcos _ data catalogue : data which is now over 20 years old and , despite showing its age , provides the best estimate of distances to nearby stars we have . the launch of _ gaia _ , and the completion of further all - sky surveys such as pan - starrs , sdss and _ wise _ , will allow a similar analysis to be performed on many times more objects .",
    "automated techniques , building on the kind demonstrated here , will be necessary to analyse and classify the objects which come from these surveys , in order to gain a full and comprehensive understanding of our corner of the galaxy and its inhabitants .",
