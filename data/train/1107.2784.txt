    "the problem of the origin of cosmic rays ( crs ) in the pev energy range remains open for several decades .",
    "the model of diffusive shock acceleration at the outer front of expanding supernova remnants ( snrs ) has become the most widely spread one , see , e.g. ,  [ 1 ] , though it has not been experimentally confirmed yet . along with supernova remnants , other possible sources of pev crs",
    "have been considered . in particular , shortly after pulsars were discovered and identified with neutron stars , it was demonstrated that they can be effective accelerators of crs  [ 2 ] .",
    "interest to pulsars as possible sources of crs with energies @xmath1  ev and up to ultrahigh energies did not vanish [ 37 ] . models considered included acceleration both in pulsar wind nebulae ( e.g. , the crab nebula ) and by isolated pulsars .",
    "it was demonstrated in particular that the geminga pulsar is a possible candidate for being the single source of the knee at 3  pev  [ 5 ] .",
    "there is no surprise then that one of the areas of investigations in the field are attempts to find correlation between arrival directions of crs and coordinates of their possible astrophysical sources , including snrs , pulsars , and some other .    in our previous works dedicated to the analysis of arrival directions of extensive air showers ( eas ) registered with the eas msu and eas1000 prototype ( below , `` pro1000 '' ) arrays , we have already presented a number of regions of excessive flux ( refs ) of pev cosmic rays [ 811 ] .",
    "it was shown that not all of them could be matched with galactic supernova remnants . however",
    ", a substantial part of refs could be matched with isolated pulsars in whose vicinities nebulae are not observed . in this work ,",
    "we consider three regions selected in the eas msu array data at a level of confidence greater than @xmath0 .",
    "none of these could be matched with galactic supernova remnants , but there are isolated pulsars inside or in close vicinities of these regions , some of which are able to accelerate heavy nuclei up to energies close to pev . for two of these regions ,",
    "there are similar regions in the pro1000 experimental data .",
    "as in our previous studies of eas arrival directions , the main data sets consist of 513,602 showers registered with the eas msu array in 19841990 and 1,342,340 showers of the pro1000 array registered in 19971999 . a description of the arrays can be found in  [ 12 ] and  [ 13 ] respectively .",
    "all eas selected for the analysis satisfy a number of quality criteria and have zenith angles @xmath2 .",
    "showers registered with the two arrays have different number of charged particles  @xmath3 in a typical event . for the eas msu array ,",
    "the median value of  @xmath3 is of the order of @xmath4 , while that for the pro1000 array equals @xmath5 .",
    "according to the modern models of hadronic interactions and data on the chemical composition of cosmic rays , the given values of  correspond to the energies of a primary proton @xmath6  ev and @xmath7  ev respectively , with an error of about 10%20% .",
    "the eas msu array allowed one to determine arrival directions of eas with a better accuracy than the pro1000 array but the mean error is estimated to be of the order of  @xmath8 in both cases .",
    "the investigation is based on the method by alexandreas , which was developed for the analysis of arrival directions of eas registered with the cygnus array  [ 14 ] and since then has been used multiple times for the analysis of results of other experiments on crs .",
    "the idea of the method is as follows . to every shower in the experimental data set ,",
    "arrival time of another shower is assigned in a pseudo - random way .",
    "after this , new equatorial coordinates @xmath9 are calculated for the `` mixed '' data set thus providing a `` mixed '' map of arrival directions .",
    "the mixed map differs from the original one but has the same distribution in declination  @xmath10 . in order to compare both maps ,",
    "one divides them into sufficiently small `` basic '' cells .",
    "a measure of difference between any two regions ( cells ) of the two maps located within the same boundaries is defined as @xmath11 where  and  are the number of eas inside a cell in the real and `` mixed '' ( background ) maps correspondingly .",
    "the mixing of the real map is performed multiple times , and the mixed maps are averaged then in order to reduce the dependence of the result on the choice of arrival times .",
    "the method is based on an assumption that the resulting mean `` background '' map has most of the properties of an isotropic background , and presents the distribution of arrival directions of cosmic rays that would be registered with the array in case there is no anisotropy .",
    "thus , deviations of the real map from the background one may be assigned to a kind of anisotropy of arrival directions of eas registered with the array . as a rule , selection of regions of excessive flux",
    "is performed basing on the condition @xmath12 .    as in  [ 15 ] , the basic cells have the size @xmath13 and the number of cycles of mixing equals 10,000 . due to this ,",
    "the difference in the number of showers in basic cells of any two sequentially averaged maps by the end of the mixing cycle is of the order or ( 12)@xmath14 for both data sets .",
    "the procedure of constructing cells ( regions ) for comparing the number of eas falling into them is as follows .",
    "adjacent basic strips in  @xmath10 ( each @xmath15 wide ) were joined into strips of width @xmath16 with the step equal to  @xmath15 .",
    "each wide strip was then divided into adjacent cells of some fixed width  @xmath17 .",
    "after this , we calculated the number of eas inside each of these cells for both experimental ( ) and background ( ) maps . for each pair of cells , @xmath18 was calculated then .",
    "a cell was considered as a possible cell of excessive flux ( cef ) if @xmath12 .",
    "every wide strip was divided into cells with a shift of @xmath15 in the angular distance in  @xmath19 until all possible locations on the grid were covered .",
    "contrary to  [ 11 ] , we did not restrict the search to cells such that @xmath20 , where  @xmath21 is the mean value of  @xmath10 for the current strip , and @xmath17 is rounded to the nearest half - integer number , but allowed @xmath17 to deviate from that value in such a way that the area of the resulting cells deviated from the original one by  1/6 . as a result , additional cells were considered .",
    "for example , besides cells of the size @xmath22 , we also considered cells of the sizes @xmath23 and @xmath24 . finally , only cells with more than 100 real eas inside were analyzed .",
    "the method of alexandreas et  al . does not provide a direct answer to the question about the chance probability of appearance of a cef .",
    "one is expected to calculate the corresponding probability basing on the value of  @xmath18 , which is an estimate of the standard deviation of a sample and thus acts as a significance level .",
    "it is implicitly assumed by this that the deviation of  from  has a gaussian distribution .",
    "hence , the chance probability of a cef to appear is estimated to be less than @xmath25 providing it was selected at significance level @xmath12 .    in order to estimate the chance probability of appearance of a cef basing on the number of eas inside , we introduced the following simple method based on the binomial distribution  [ 11 ] .",
    "let a shower axis getting inside the cef be a success .",
    "the number of trials equals the number of showers  @xmath26 in the data set under consideration , and an estimate of success ( for a fixed region ) equals @xmath27 , where  is the number of showers in the cell of the background map .",
    "the assumption is based on the fact that in the method of alexandreas ,  is considered to be an expected number of showers in a cell .",
    "obviously , the chance probability of finding exactly  eas in a cell ( or region ) equals @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a random variable equal to the number of successes in the binomial model , and @xmath30 is the corresponding binomial coefficient .",
    "it is more interesting to consider a probability that there are at most  showers in the cell @xmath31 .",
    "the analysis performed and the data presented below demonstrate that values of  correlate well with the values of chance probabilities calculated on the basis of significance level  @xmath18 .",
    "the fact that @xmath12 for a given cell does not imply it is valid for its subcells .",
    "a situation such that @xmath32 for a number of adjacent cells but @xmath12 for a cell ( region ) combined of them is possible . in order to improve the robustness of selection of cefs , we have tried a number of additional quantities .",
    "one of the most efficient of them is the probability @xmath33 , calculated from the following binomial model .",
    "let  @xmath34 be a random variable equal to the number of basic cells of the given cell with an excess of eas over the background values , and @xmath35 is the corresponding experimental value .",
    "the number of trials equals the number of basic cells in the cef .",
    "it is natural to assume the probability of success to be equal to  1/2 . in the results presented below , all cefs",
    "satisfy a condition @xmath36 , which corresponds to the significance level of @xmath37 for the gaussian distribution .",
    "we thus reduced the chance that a cef is selected solely due to the non - uniformity of the eas distribution w.r.t .  @xmath10",
    "in what follows , we consider refs found in the eas msu array experimental data under the conditions @xmath38 three regions satisfying  ( 1 ) were found , see fig .  1 and table  1 .",
    "each of them consists of a number of partially overlapping cells , selected with the algorithm described above .",
    "the probability that any of the three refs appears by chance is @xmath39 .",
    "this estimate follows from the values of  shown in table  1 , as well as from the fact that @xmath40 for all the refs : the corresponding probability equals @xmath41 for the significance level equal to  4 .",
    "regions  a and  b have `` partners '' in the pro1000 data set .",
    "these are regions that satisfy conditions @xmath12 , @xmath36 , @xmath42 and partially overlap with those two regions in the eas msu data set .     omitted .",
    "blue rectangles show refs found in the pro1000 data set that partially overlap with the above refs in the eas msu data and satisfy conditions @xmath12 , @xmath36 , @xmath42 ( `` partners '' ) .",
    "filled red triangles show coordinates of the galactic supernova remnants  @xcite .",
    "filled blue diamonds show coordinates of the galactic pulsars  @xcite .",
    "the curves at the left and right sides of the figure show the galactic plane , the @xmath43-like curve shows the supergalactic plane . ]",
    ".some parameters of the refs in the eas msu data set that satisfy conditions  ( 1 ) ( a , b , c ) , and their `` partners '' in the pro1000 data set ( a@xmath44 , b@xmath44 ) .",
    "notation : @xmath19 and @xmath10 are the ranges of values of the corresponding coordinates ; ,  are the ranges of the experimental and background flux of eas in the cells that constitute the ref respectively , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the maximum value of the significance level  @xmath18 and the minimum value of  for the cells that constitute the ref . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the distances to the pulsars from table  2 exceed considerably the free path of pev neutrons , and the amount of electromagnetic showers is insufficient for formation of refs . in view of this , the question arises of how to keep the arrival direction of ( charged ) crs propagating through the galactic magnetic field . we are currently not ready to suggest a satisfactory model for answering this question , but we note at least two models were suggested to explain the refs of crs with energies of the order of 10  tev registered with the milagro gamma - ray observatory  [ 18 ] .",
    "one of the models is based on cr acceleration in the vicinity of the geminga pulsar [ 19 ] , the properties of which are similar to those of the pulsar j1836 + 5925 located at the boundary of the b region  [ 20 ] .",
    "the other one uses a specific magnetic field configuration able to focus a flux of charged particle  [ 21 ] .    to conclude , we have presented three regions of excessive flux of pev crs selected from the eas msu experimental data at a significance level @xmath47 and satisfying several additional conditions . in the vicinity of every region , there are isolated galactic pulsars that are able to accelerate sufficiently heavy nuclei to the required energies . in our opinion",
    ", this does not give enough ground to claim that the above refs are formed due to contribution from these pulsars but can witness in favor of the assumption that ( 1 ) some isolated pulsars contribute to the flux of pev crs more than is usually assumed and ( 2 ) there are efficient mechanisms of focusing cr in the interstellar space .",
