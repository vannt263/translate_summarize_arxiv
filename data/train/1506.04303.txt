    "real time operation of the power grid and computation of electricity prices @xcite require accurate estimation of its structure and critical state variables .",
    "remote terminal units ( rtus ) transmit measurements collected from different grid components to the central control center for state estimation and subsequent use in analyzing grid stability .",
    "the collected measurements can be broadly classified into two kinds : meter readings and breaker statuses .",
    "the breaker statuses on transmission lines help create the current operational topology of the grid .",
    "the meter readings , comprising of line flow and bus power injection measurements , are then used to estimate the state variables over the estimated topology . in a practical",
    "setting , the collected measurements suffer from noise , that get added at source or during communication to the control center .",
    "the affect of such noise is minimized through placement of redundant / additional meters and use of suitable bad - data detection and correction techniques at the estimator @xcite .",
    "cyber - attacks on the power grid refer to corruption of measurements ( meter readings and breaker statuses ) by an adversary , aimed at changing the state estimation output , without getting detected by the estimator s checks .",
    "the viability of such attacks has in fact been demonstrated through controlled experiments like the aurora attack in department of energy s idaho laboratory and gps spoofing attack on phasor measurement units ( pmus ) @xcite .",
    "past literature on cyber - attacks have generally looked at adversaries that change meter data ( and not breaker statuses ) to affect state estimation .",
    "such data attacks involving injection of malicious data into meters were first analyzed in @xcite . using a dc power flow model for state estimation , the authors of @xcite provide an attack design using projection matrices . following this ,",
    "several approaches have been discussed to study hidden attacks under different operating conditions .",
    "these include mixed integer programming @xcite , heuristic based detection @xcite , sparse recovery using @xmath0 relaxation @xcite , graph - cut based construction for systems with phasor measurement units ( pmus ) @xcite among others .",
    "the possible economic ill - affects of such hidden data attacks on power markets are presented in @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigates hidden attacks under the more general and potent regime of topology data ( breaker statuses ) and meter data corruption .",
    "all of these cited work on data alone or topology and data attacks , however , require changing floating point meter measurements in real time .",
    "the practicality of this is questionable as significant resources are required to synchronize the changes at multiple meters .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on hidden attacks that primarily operate through changes in breaker statuses . here",
    "the adversary changes the statuses of a few operational breakers from @xmath1 ( closed ) to @xmath2 ( open ) , as well as jams ( blocks the communication ) of flow measurements on a subset of transmission lines in the grid .",
    "however , the adversary does not modify any meter reading to an arbitrary value .",
    "we term these attacks as breaker - jammer attacks .",
    "note that breaker statuses , unlike meter readings , are binary in nature and fluctuate with lower frequency .",
    "they are thus easier to change , even by adversaries with limited resources .",
    "jamming measurements , through jammers or by destruction of communication apparatus , is technologically less intensive than corrupting meter measurements .",
    "in fact , jamming does not raise a major alarm as measurement loss due random communication drops occurs under normal circumstances .",
    "the breaker - jammer attack model was introduced by the authors for grids with a specific meter configuration requiring sufficient line flow measurements in @xcite .",
    "this work generalizes the framework to any grid with line flow and injection meters and uses a novel graph - coloring analysis to determine the optimal hidden attack .",
    "our graph coloring based analysis is in principal similar to @xcite which studies standard data attacks as a graph partitioning problem .",
    "however , the similarly ends there as our attack model does not use corruption of meter readings .",
    "instead breaker status changes and line flow jams provide a different set of necessary and sufficient conditions for feasible attacks .",
    "the surprising revelation of our analysis is that under normal operating conditions , a single breaker status change ( with the necessary flow measurement jamming ) is sufficient to create an undetectable attack .",
    "in fact , we show that if a hidden attack can be constructed by changing the status of a set of breakers , then a hidden attack using only one break status change exists as well .",
    "this is significant as the adversary can focus on jamming the necessary flow measurements , after selecting a breaker to attack .",
    "further , our attack design does not depend on the current system state or transmission line parameter values , and has low information requirements .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the system model used in generalized state estimation and describe the attack model in the next section . the graph coloring approach to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a hidden attack and elucidating examples are discussed in section [ sec : coloring ] .",
    "the design of the optimal hidden attack is discussed in section [ sec : design ] along with simulations on ieee test cases . finally , concluding remarks and future directions of work are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "first , we provide a brief description of the notation used .",
    "we represent the current operational structure of the grid by graph @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the set of buses / nodes of size @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes the set of operational edges of size @xmath7 .",
    "the set of binary breakers statuses for the edges is denoted by the diagonal matrix @xmath8 of size @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that all lines to be initially operational ( @xmath8 is identity matrix ) and ignore any non - operation line for ease of notation .",
    "the edge to node incidence matrix is denoted by @xmath10 of dimension @xmath11 .",

    "the direction of flow on edge @xmath12 is taken to be from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , without any loss of generality .",
    "we consider the dc power flow model for state estimation in this paper @xcite .",
    "the state variables in this model are the bus phase angles , denoted by the @xmath20 vector @xmath21 .",
    "the set of measurements is denoted by the vector @xmath22 . here",
    "line flow measurements are included in @xmath23 and bus injection measurements are included in @xmath24 .",
    "state estimation in the power grid relies on the breaker statuses in @xmath8 for topology estimation and then uses the meter measurements @xmath25 for estimating the state vector @xmath21 .",
    "the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath25 in the dc model is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the zero mean gaussian noise vector with covariance matrix @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the measurement matrix and depends on the grid structure and susceptance of transmission lines .",
    "let the @xmath30 entry in @xmath25 corresponds to the flow measurement on line @xmath12 .",

    "@xmath34 is the susceptance of the line @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath35 entry corresponds to an injection measurement at node @xmath13 , we have @xmath36 . in matrix form , ignoring measurement noise , we can write equations for received measurements as @xmath37 @xmath38 is the diagonal matrix of susceptances of lines in @xmath6 .",
    "we arrange the rows in @xmath10 such that the top @xmath39 rows represent the lines with flow measurements .",

    "@xmath41 on the other hand consists of the columns of @xmath10 that correspond to the nodes with injection measurements .",
    "the optimal state vector estimate @xmath42 is given by minimizing the residual @xmath43 .",
    "if the minimum residual does not satisfy a tolerance threshold , bad - data detection flags turn on and data correction is done by the estimator .",
    "the overall scheme of topology and state estimation processes followed by bad - data detection and correction is called generalized state estimation ( gse ) @xcite as illustrated in figure [ estimator ] .",

    "is denoted by @xmath44 where diagonal matrix @xmath45 has a value of @xmath1 for attacked breakers .",

    "the breaker attack leads to removal of lines marked as open from equation ( [ injmat ] ) , resulting in the following modification .",
    "@xmath55 equation ( [ injcond ] ) thus states that after the breaker - jammer attack , for each injection measurement , the sum of original flows contributed by lines with attacked breakers ( left side ) needs to be accommodated by changes in estimated flows on lines ( connected to the same bus ) whose breakers are intact but actual flow measurements are not received ( right side ) . finally , for unique state estimation following the adversarial attack ( with one bus considered reference bus with phase angle @xmath2 ) we need @xmath56    the necessary conditions for a successful breaker - jammer attack that results in a change in estimated state vector consists of equations ( [ flowcond ] ) , ( [ breakjam ] ) , ( [ injcond ] ) , and ( [ rank ] ) . in the next section ,",
    "we describe a graph coloring based analysis of the necessary and sufficient conditions and use it to discuss design of optimal attacks of our regime .",
    "for our graph coloring based analysis , we use the following coloring scheme : _ for any change @xmath57 in the estimated state vector , neighboring buses with same value in @xmath57 are given same color .",
    "_ using this , we now discuss a permissible graph coloring corresponding to the requirements of a feasible attack discussed in the previous section .",

    "note that in the reduced graph @xmath62 , original lines between buses of same color are removed .",
    "the included lines exist between buses of different colors and have jammed or unavailable flow measurements .",
    "similarly , injection measurement relation ( [ injcond ] ) at interior nodes are trivially satisfied by @xmath57 and are ignored .",
    "the reduced system , thus , only includes constraints from boundary injection measurements that are similar in form to equation ( [ injcond ] ) as shown below : @xmath64 here , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are supernodes of different colors . the numeric value for the color of supernode @xmath13 is given by @xmath65 ( not the @xmath19 entry in @xmath66 ) . @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the susceptance matrix and edge set corresponding to the reduced graph @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath69 denotes the injection measurement on supernode @xmath13 with value given by step @xmath70 in the reduced graph construction .",
    "note that equation ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) for the injection measurements involves rows of the susceptance weighted laplacian matrix for @xmath62 .",
    "a unique solution of @xmath66 for @xmath62 in turn provides a uniquely estimated @xmath57 in @xmath71 after the adversarial attack .",
    "we now look at condition ( [ rank ] ) , necessary for unique state estimation after a feasible adversarial attack in terms of graph coloring .",
    "the reduced graph @xmath62 greatly simplifies our analysis here .",
    "first , it is clear that each color must have at least one supernode or a neighboring supernode ( of different color ) with injection measurement .",
    "otherwise the value of @xmath66 for that color will not be in any injection constraint .",
    "this goes against uniqueness of state estimation .",
    "note that the number of degrees of freedom in @xmath66 ( representing distinct values in @xmath57 ) is one less than the number of colors as one color denotes the reference phase change of @xmath2 .",
    "using @xmath62 , we prove the following result regarding permissible graph coloring for unique estimation .",
    "[ oneless ] following a breaker - jammer attack , the number of injection measurements at the boundary buses should be one less than the number of distinct colors in the grid buses .",
    "let the number of colored groups be @xmath72 .",
    "then the number of independent entries in @xmath66 is @xmath73 ( one entry being @xmath2 ) .",
    "the total number of linear constraints involving the numeric values in @xmath66 is equal to the number of injection measurements at the supernodes in @xmath62 . for unique state estimation ,",
    "the number of injection measurements should thus be greater than or equal to @xmath73 .",
    "we now show that exactly @xmath73 injection measurements are needed to get a solution to state estimation .",
    "consider the reduced graph @xmath62 .",
    "for real valued line susceptances and for cases where the supernodes having injection measurements do not form a closed ring with no additional branches ( see figure [ fig : supernode ] ) , the rank of @xmath73 rows is @xmath73 and we have unique state estimation . if the reduced graph @xmath62 contains a closed ring of supernodes with injection measurements , then the measurements will represent the entire susceptance weighted graph laplacian of the ring , that is rank deficient .",
    "however , the real valued entries in @xmath74 that exist on the right side of ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) and are derived from flows on lines with attacked breakers , will not cancel out under normal operating conditions .",
    "further , the adversary designing the attack is unaware of the current system state and will be able to determine if they do . hence the @xmath73 injections measurements constraints will be linearly independent ( the adversary will expect this under normal operations ) .",
    "this gives an unique @xmath66 and @xmath57 for a @xmath72 distinct colored grid graph .",
    "to summarize , the highlighted statements and theorem [ oneless ] provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a feasible breaker - jammer attack under our graph - coloring scheme . in the next section , we show that the graph coloring approach proves a surprising result that simplifies the design of an optimal attack .",
    "we call an breaker - jammer feasible attack optimal if it requires minimum number of breaker status changes ( considering the fact that doing so is significantly more resource draining than measurement jamming ) . if multiple attacks are possible using the minimum number of breaker changes , we select as optimal the attack that requires the least number of flow measurement jams . using the reduced graph @xmath62 , we present the following result for the minimum number of breaker changes needed for a feasible attack under normal operating conditions ( non - zero real - valued bus susceptances and line flows that are distinct for different grid elements ) .",
    "[ oneenough ] if a feasible attack can be designed with @xmath72 breaker status changes , then a feasible attack exists such that all but one breaker statuses are changed back to their original operational state ( @xmath1 ) , while keeping their line flow measurements jammed .",
    "construct the reduced graph @xmath62 with its colored supernodes for the feasible attack with @xmath72 breakers and necessary flow measurement jams .",
    "let the number of colors in state estimation change @xmath57 be @xmath75 .",
    "the length of @xmath66 is then @xmath75 . by theorem [ oneless ] , there are @xmath76 injection measurements at the supernodes that provide constraint equations listed in ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) .",
    "if we revert the breaker status of an attacked line back to @xmath1 while keeping its flow measurement jammed , the only change in any constraint equation ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) involving that line will be that the injection measurement on the incident node ( entry in @xmath77 ) will become @xmath2 .",
    "since all but one breakers are brought back to the operational state , at least one injection measurement in @xmath77 will still remain non - zero and the @xmath76 constraint equations will still have linear inndependence .",
    "thus , state estimation will result in a different but non - zero @xmath66 , leading to a feasible attack .",
    "for example , consider the case in figure [ fig : graphcoloring ] where two breaker statuses are attacked . if the breaker status on line @xmath61 is changed back to @xmath1 while keeping the flow measurement jammed , the new reduced graph that will be derived is given in figure [ fig : supernode1 ] . as mentioned in theorem",
    "[ oneenough ] , the coloring scheme is still feasible and a non - zero change in state estimation results .",
    "bus case given in figure [ fig : graphcoloring ] , but with line @xmath61 being changed to a dotted red line .",
    "the blue , green and black solid circles represent super nodes for buses @xmath13 , @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath59 respectively . the flow on the dotted red lines are not received .",
    "the only grey line with red bar represents the line @xmath60 with an attacked breaker.,scaledwidth=33.0%,scaledwidth=22.0% ]    [ fig : supernode1 ]    this is a very significant result and simplifies the search for an optimal attack greatly . since one breaker change is sufficient , the adversary can select each line in turn ( @xmath7 iterations ) , attack its breaker ( change the corresponding entry in diagonal @xmath45 to @xmath1 ) and determine the flow measurements that need to be jammed ( given by diagonal @xmath47 ) to conduct a feasible attack . the breaker change that requires the minimum number of measurement jams ( or maximally sparse @xmath47 ) will then give the optimal attack .",
    "the selection of jammed measurements , after fixing @xmath45 , is formulated as ( [ opt_attack ] ) .",
    "@xmath78 this is simplified in formulation ( [ opt_attack1 ] ) where the jammed measurements ( with @xmath1 on diagonal of @xmath47 ) are given by the non - zero entries in @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath0 relaxation can be used to approximately solve ( [ opt_attack1 ] ) . since the adversary has no access to the actual state vector @xmath21 , a random non - zero @xmath21",
    "similarly , unavailable line susceptance @xmath38 are replaced with distinct real values .",
    "these replacements , under normal conditions , do not affect the optimal solution as they preserve the linear independence of injection constraints given in ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) .",
    "@xmath80 the rank constraint ( [ rank ] ) is not included in the optimization framework and can be checked manually after determining @xmath47 , for consistency . +",
    "* experiments : * we simulate our attack model on ieee @xmath81 and @xmath82 bus test systems @xcite and present averaged findings in figure [ fig : topologyplot ] . for each test system considered , we place flow measurements on all lines and injection measurements on a fraction of buses , selected randomly . to design a feasible attack involving a line , we change its breaker status and solve problem ( [ opt_attack1 ] ) to jam flows measurements to prevent detection .",
    "this is repeated for each line to determine the optimal attack . in figure",
    "[ fig : topologyplot ] , note that the average number of flow measurements jammed increases with the number of injection measurements .",
    "this happens due to an increase in the number of injection constraints that require more measurement jams .",

    "in this paper , we study topology based cyber - attacks on power grids where an adversary changes the breaker statuses of operational lines and marks them as open .",
    "the adversary also jams flow measurements on certain lines to prevent detection at the state estimator .",
    "the attack framework is novel as it does not involve any injection of corrupted data into meters or knowledge of system parameters and current system state .",
    "using lesser information and resource overhead than traditional data attacks , our attack regime explores attacks on systems where all meter data are protected from external manipulation .",
    "we discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible attacks through a new graph - coloring approach .",
    "the most important result arising from our analysis is that optimal topology based attacks exist that require a single breaker status change .",
    "finally , we discuss an optimization framework to select flow measurements that are jammed to prevent detection of the optimal attack .",
