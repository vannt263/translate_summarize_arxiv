    "topological phases are quantum phases which can not be described by a local order parameter . instead , the defining characteristic of topological phases is a pattern of long - range quantum entanglement which is called topological order @xcite .",
    "one characteristic property of topological order is the dependence of the ground - state degeneracy on the topology of the manifold on which the system is defined @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy on manifolds might also serve as a starting point for a general classification of topological phases of strongly correlated quantum matter , complementary to the topological band theory which is based on single - particle states and can not be easily generalized to correlated systems @xcite .",
    "recently , there is much interest in topological phases @xcite due to their possible application in topological quantum computation .",
    "however , these phases are also of fundamental scientific interest for their ability to support exotic quasiparticle ( qp ) excitations with abelian and even nonabelian quantum statistics .",
    "one particularly interesting class of topological phases are topological superconductors , which have been predicted to host majorana bound states @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 superconductor ( sc ) for spinless fermions is a prototype system for topological scs . depending on the chemical potential , the ground state of the @xmath1 sc",
    "is realized by the weak or the strong pairing phase , which can be distinguished topologically . in particular , the grand canonical ground state of the weak pairing phase on the torus depends on boundary conditions ( bcs ) for each of the two primitive directions  @xcite . here , the ground state with only periodic bcs is special and shows an odd parity , while the three ground states with at least one antiperiodic bc are characterized by an even parity .",
    "in contrast , the strong pairing phase and also the ordinary @xmath2-wave sc on the torus possess a fourfold degenerate even parity ground state  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a quasi one - dimensional ring shaped sc nanowire and demonstrate that essential aspects of the above described topological degeneracy on the torus carry over to this simpler geometry .",
    "we focus on a regime in which the quasiparticle gap @xmath3 is larger than the single - particle level spacing @xmath4 . in the coulomb blockade regime ,",
    "the total particle number and hence the parity of the sc nanowire are fixed by the charging energy @xmath5 and the degeneracy of grand canonical ground states is reflected in the excitation energies , which can be observed in nonlinear coulomb blockade transport  @xcite .",
    "the lowest excited state above the ground state of a trivial sc with even parity involves two bogoliubov qps and thus breaks a cooper pair , incurring an excitation energy @xmath6 , which is essentially independent of magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the ground state for odd parity always has one bogoliubov qp , and hence the lowest excited state involves both annihilating and creating a bogoliubov qp which costs the excitation energy @xmath7 . for nontrivial",
    "topological scs the situation is very different . here ,",
    "ground states without unpaired particles at the fermi energy have odd parity for periodic bc , and even parity for anti - periodic bc .",
    "therefore , the excitation energy @xmath8 oscillates between @xmath9 and @xmath10 as function of magnetic flux with period @xmath0 which is doubled as compared to the case of a trivial sc @xcite .",
    "this connection between the ground - state degeneracy on manifolds with nonzero genus and the @xmath0 flux periodicity of ring structures demonstrates that these properties are a general consequence of topological order and that nonlinear coulomb blockade transport is a suitable tool to investigate topological order .",
    "recent experiments show evidence for majorana fermions and topological superconductivity  @xcite in semiconductor ( sm ) nanowires with strong rashba spin - orbit coupling in a magnetic field and proximity coupled to an @xmath2-wave sc  @xcite . despite the effort which has been invested , clear experimental signatures of the unconventional nature of the superconducting state are still missing .",
    "therefore , additional detection schemes have been suggested such as the periodicity of the josephson effect  @xcite , tunneling spectroscopy  @xcite , interferometry  @xcite , transport experiments  @xcite , and coincidence measurements  @xcite .",
    "we here propose another experiment which directly investigates consequences of topological order on a nontrivial manifold .",
    "for this purpose , we use the coulomb energy as an instrument to prescribe the parity of the hybrid system and thus to observe the above discussed ground - state degeneracy .",
    "our analysis is based on the identification of the pfaffian @xmath11 invariant @xmath12 for hamiltonians in class d @xcite with the parity of the grand canonical ground state .",
    "thus , we use this key piece of information about the grand canonical ground state to construct two classes of states with parity @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the class of states with parity @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) contains all eigenstates with an even ( odd ) number of qp excitations .",
    "we find two types of excitation spectra which display trivial or nontrivial superconductivity depending on parameter values .",
    "the transition between the different topological phases is characterized by the closing and reopening of an excitation gap .",
    "as these findings only rely on the existence of a superconducting gap @xmath14 and the @xmath15 topology of the system , the excitation spectra are robust against disorder , spatial variations of the superconducting pairing potential , geometry details , and the existence of additional transverse subbands .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model_system ] , we introduce the model system and the proposed experimental setup . we continue in section [ sec : single_band_hamiltonian ] with a brief review of the results in ref .",
    "@xcite for single - band sm nanowires and study the robustness of these results against details of the geometry , electrostatic disorder , and local variations of the superconducting order parameter . in section [ sec : multi_band_hamiltonian ] we make a departure from the case of strictly one - dimensional nanowires and consider the experimentally realistic case of quasi one - dimensional nanowires . in section",
    "[ sec : cotunneling_of_cooper_pairs ] , we compare the current for the single - electron tunneling with the current due to cotunneling of cooper pairs which is the most relevant transport channel competing with sequential tunneling of electrons .",

    "the nanowire forms an annulus in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane with radius @xmath18 and radial extension @xmath19 .",
    "we assume a strong confinement in @xmath20-direction , i.e. the extension perpendicular to the plane of the annulus @xmath21 , such that only the lowest subband with momentum in @xmath20-direction is occupied .",
    "this hybrid system is separated from a back - gate by a thin insulating layer and weakly tunnel - coupled to source and drain electrodes with potentials @xmath22 . assuming a strong capacitive coupling between the nanowire and the sc , the total number of electrons in this system is determined by the coulomb hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the charging energy and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) the number of excess electrons in the sm ( sc ) attracted by the back - gate . varying the gate potential @xmath27 allows to change the total electron number @xmath28 in discrete units .",
    "a current through this island involves changing the electron number from @xmath28 to @xmath29 and creating or annihilating a qp excitation .",
    "thus , resonances in the differential conductivity appear when the condition @xmath30 is satisfied , where @xmath31 is the total energy of a state with @xmath28 electrons and @xmath32 the respective ground - state energy .",
    "the spacing between the resonance peaks is independent of the charging energy @xmath24 and displays the excitation spectrum for fixed particle number , @xmath33 in our analysis , we assume that both the charging energy @xmath24 and the qp gap @xmath34 in the sc are larger than the effective gap @xmath35 in the sm . hence , for small voltages @xmath36 all electrons in the sc are paired and unpaired electrons as well as breaking of cooper pairs can only show up in the sm . as a consequence ,",
    "the parity in the sc is always even and the parity in the sm nanowire is determined by the total parity of the hybrid system .",
    "the coulomb hamiltonian eq . fixes the total particle number while the particle number in the sm nanowire fluctuates because of the strong coupling between the sm nanowire and the sc . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the average particle number in the sm nanowire is fixed and whenever we refer to the particle number in the sm nanowire , we refer to its average .",
    "we describe the low - energy physics of the nanowire by the lattice hamiltonian @xmath37  @xcite with @xmath38 where the operator @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath41 with spin @xmath42 and mass @xmath43 .",
    "the first term describes hopping on a simple square lattice with lattice parameter @xmath44 , @xmath45 for the nearest  neighbor lattice vectors @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . the second term in eq . contains the chemical potential @xmath48 , the electrostatic disorder potential @xmath49 , and the zeeman energy splitting @xmath50 due to the magnetic field in @xmath20-direction .",
    "the last terms in eq . represent the rashba spin - orbit coupling with spin - orbit velocity @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the pauli spin matrices with @xmath53 . by coupling electrons with opposite spins ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupling creates two helical bands with spin rotating in the @xmath16-@xmath17-plane .",

    "the proximity coupling between the @xmath2-wave sc and the nanowire is described by the effective @xmath2-wave pairing hamiltonian @xmath54 with pairing potential @xmath55 .",
    "the pairing potential modifies the dispersion relation in a crucial way by inducing two excitation energies .",
    "it opens an effective pairing gap at the fermi surface , and reduces the spin gap at zero momentum .",
    "depending on @xmath56 , @xmath48 , and @xmath3 , the sm nanowire shows two topologically distinct superconducting phases which are separated from each other by a topological phase transition @xcite . for one",
    "partially occupied subband and @xmath57 , the nanowire is in the topologically trivial phase . by tuning the chemical potential via the gate voltage or the zeeman energy via the magnetic field",
    ", the nanowire can be tuned across the phase transition , which shows up as the closing and reopening of the qp excitation gap . in the topologically nontrivial phase , which is reached for @xmath58 ,",
    "such a nanowire supports a pair of zero - energy majorana bound states located at the ends of the wire .",
    "we here consider a closed nanowire without end points and thus without majorana bound states .",
    "however , the unconventional nature of the topologically nontrivial superconducting phase shows up in the doubling of the magnetic flux period of the excitation spectrum from @xmath59 to @xmath60 @xcite . in our analysis",
