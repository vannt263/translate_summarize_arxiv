    "to date essentially all the approaches which have been used to model the emission region in x - ray pulsars have limitations .",
    "past efforts have typically adopted a geometry suitable for a particular accretion rate ( @xmath0 ) regime and then predict the emission properties by a range of techniques .",
    "radiative transfer calculations ( e.g. burnard , arons & klein 1991 ) are necessarily restricted to symmetric , homogeneous emission regions , where in reality the accretion column may be hollow and even incomplete ( an ` accretion curtain ' ) .",
    "the geometric fitting approach , where a beam pattern is assumed and then the geometry is varied ( e.g. leahy 1991 ) can not reproduce sharper features observed in several sources .",
    "neither method can generate asymmetric pulse profiles without resorting to an off - center magnetic axis , for which there is no other observational evidence .",
    "recent observations of the x - ray pulsar gx  1 + 4 suggest a rather different scenario .",
    "the x - ray continuum spectrum of gx  1 + 4 is rather flat ( with photon index @xmath1 ) up to a cutoff around 10 - 20  kev , above which the decay is steeper ; it is one of the hardest known amongst the x - ray pulsars .",
    "analysis of recent rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) data shows that the spectrum is generally consistent with those predicted by unsaturated comptonisation models ( e.g. galloway et al .",
    "pulse profiles are extremely variable and typically asymmetric , often with a sharp dip forming the primary minimum ( greenhill , galloway & storey 1998 ) . during a low flux episode in july 1996 ,",
    "the pulse profiles were found to shift in asymmetry from ` leading - edge bright ' ( with the maximum closely following the sharp primary minimum ) to ` trailing - edge bright ' . the entire observation which captured the change spanned only 34 hours , and occurred just 10 days before a short - lived transition from rather constant spin - down to spin - up and back again ( giles et al .",
    "we propose a model which seeks to explain the sharp primary minima seen in this and other sources ( a 0535 + 262 , cemeljic & bulik 1998 ; and rx j0812.4 - 3114 , reig & roche 1999 ) and ultimately the change in the pulse profiles .",
    "a monte - carlo code is used to generate the spectra and pulse profiles emitted by two semi - infinite homogeneous cyclindrical accretion columns of radius @xmath2 , diametrically located on the surface of a ` canonical ' neutron star of radius @xmath3  km ( figure 1a ) .",
    "the algorithms of pozdnyakov , sobol & syunyaev ( 1983 ) are used to draw the photon energy and direction , electron energies , and to calculate the fully relativistic ( non - magnetic ) cross - section for compton scattering . outside the accretion column ,",
    "the redshift and bending of photon trajectories by the neutron star s gravity is calculated by assuming a schwarzschild metric .",
    "we simulate a single column for both poles of the star , and generate pulse profiles for a range of geometries simultaneously .",
    "the beam pattern and pulse profiles over a range of geometries are shown in figure 1 b ) and c ) .",
    "we note that when ( @xmath4 ) the emission exhibits a strong modulation at the stars rotation period , with the primary minimum corresponding to the closest passage of the line of sight with one of the magnetic polar axes . as @xmath5 and @xmath6 increase the primary minimum becomes progressively narrower . when @xmath7 , a secondary minimum ( from the passage of the second axis through the line of sight ) is observed .",
    "the emission is beamed at an angle @xmath8 with respect to the column axis ; this corresponds to a ` fan ' type beam .",
    "emission at smaller angles is supressed as a consequence of the decreased escape probability for photons propagating along the column axis . that emission is beamed at @xmath8",
    "is a consequence of the gravitational light bending ; this is also affected by the size of the column @xmath2 .",
    "our simulations indicate that the mean spectra also depend strongly on the density of the column and the viewing geometry .",
    "since we assume a constant infall velocity @xmath9 and neglect effects due to radiation pressure on the infalling electrons , the results described are only applicable to systems with low @xmath0 .",
    "previous low-@xmath0 models predict a ` pencil ' rather than ` fan ' beam , with emission reaching a maximum at small angles relative to the accretion column .",
    "this is probably because of the assumed ` slab ' or ` mound ' shaped emission region .",
    "interactions between photons and the inflowing material in the accretion column , which is neglected by these models , is crucial for the formation of sharp primary minima in the pulse profiles as observed in gx  1 + 4 and several x - ray pulsars . the persistence of the sharp feature in gx  1 + 4 as x - ray flux drops almost to zero points to the continued importance of this effect , even at extremely low @xmath0 ( giles et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a significant approximation is the use of the nonmagnetic compton scattering cross - section . for gx  1 + 4 - with an estimated magnetic field strength of @xmath10  g ( cui et al .",
    "1997 ) - deviations from the nonmagnetic cross section will be significant within typical observational bands for x - ray astronomy .",
    "however we suspect that magnetic effects may only play a minor role in shaping the pulse profile , principally narrowing the primary minimum and possibly giving rise to the local maxima ( ` shoulders ' ) immediately prior to and following the minimum ( giles et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "finally we note that the model - predicted pulse profiles are in general quite symmetric .",
    "a possible cause of asymmetry in the observed profiles is a variation in density across the accretion column , which could potentially develop in the region where the disc plasma becomes entrained onto the magnetic field lines and persist to the neutron star surface .",
    "this effect further suggests a mechanism for the rapid changes in profile asymmetry observed in gx  1 + 4 ( giles et al .",
    "1999 ) ; that is , the sense of asymmetry in the column changes and consequently so does the pulse profile .",
    "the detailed structure of the entrainment region is rather poorly understood , and we feel it is not possible to rule out such a phenomenon .",
    "we have described a model with homogeneous , axisymmetric , cyclindrical emission regions .",
    "to explain other qualitative features of observed pulse profiles , our model needs to be modified to take into account effects due to inhomogeneities and more complicated geometry of the emission regions ."
