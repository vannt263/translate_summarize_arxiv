    "the high - energy electromagnetic processes in crystals have been under active theoretical investigations for long time ( see , for instance , @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these investigations are of interest not only from the viewpoint of underlying physics but also from the viewpoint of practical applications .",
    "when the formation length exceeds the interatomic spacing , the interference effects from all atoms within this length are important and the cross - sections of the electromagnetic processes in crystals can change essentially compared with the corresponding quantities for an isolated atom . from the point of view of controlling the parameters of the high - energy electromagnetic processes in a medium it is of interest to investigate the influence of external fields , such as acoustic waves , temperature gradient , etc .",
    ", on the corresponding characteristics . the considerations of concrete processes , such as the diffraction radiation , transition radiation , parametric x - radiation , channelling radiation , electron - positron pair creation by high - energy photons , have shown that the external fields can essentially change the angular - frequency characteristics of these processes ( see , for example @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the coherent bremsstrahlung of high - energy electrons moving in a crystal is one of the most effective methods to produce intense beams of highly polarized and monochromatic photons ( for recent experiments in this direction see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such radiation has a number of remarkable properties and at present it has found many important applications .",
    "this motivates the importance of investigations for various mechanisms of controlling the radiation parameters .",
    "as such a mechanism , in @xcite  we have discussed the influence of hypersonic waves excited in a crystal on the process of the bremsstrahlung of high - energy electrons . in this paper , the case of a simplest crystal with a single atom in the elementary base and the sinusoidal deformation field generated by the hypersound were considered . to have an essential influence of the acoustic wave , high - frequency hypersound is needed .",
    "usually this type of waves are excited by high - frequency electromagnetic fields through the piezoelectric effect in crystals with a complex elementary base . in the present paper",
    "we generalize the results of @xcite for crystals with a complex base and for acoustic waves with an arbitrary profile .",
    "the numerical calculations are carried out for the case of the most popular quartz piezocrystal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we derive the general formula for the coherent part of the bremsstrahlung cross - section averaged over the thermal fluctuations and the conditions are specified under which the influence of the deformation field can be considerable .",
    "the analysis of the general formula in the case when the electron enters into the crystal at small angles with respect to the crystallographic axes or planes is given in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the results of the numerical calculations for the cross - section as a function of the photon energy and the amplitude of the external excitation are presented .",
    "section [ sec4 ] summarizes the main results of the paper . throughout of the paper the system of units @xmath0is used .",
    "we consider the bremsstrahlung of high energy electrons moving in a crystal .",
    "let @xmath1 be the frequency and the wave vector for the radiated photon and @xmath2 , @xmath3 be the energies and momenta for the electrons in the initial and final states respectively .",

    "the differential cross - section for the bremsstrahlung in a crystal by high energy electron can be written in the form ( see , for example @xcite)@xmath13where the vector @xmath14 specifies the positions of the atoms in the crystal and the collective index @xmath15  numerates elementary cells .    at nonzero temperature",
    "one can decompose the radius - vector as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the displacement of @xmath5-th atom with respect to the equilibrium position @xmath18  due to the thermal vibrations . after averaging over thermal fluctuations , we can write cross - section as ( see for example , @xcite for the case of a crystal with simple cell)@xmath19\\sigma _ { 0}\\left ( \\mathbf{q}\\right ) ,",

    "the contribution of the coherent effects is presented by the second term which depends on the orientation of the crystal axes with respect to the vector @xmath24 . by taking into account the formula for the cross - section on an isolated atom , in the range of the transferred momenta @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being the mass of electron ,",
    "the coherent part of the cross - section can be presented in the form@xmath27where @xmath28 . in formula ( [ sigcohdef ] ) , @xmath29 is the electron charge , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the parallel and perpendicular components of the vector @xmath24 with respect to the direction of the electron initial momentum @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the minimum longitudinal momentum transfer , and @xmath34 is the formation length for the process of bremsstrahlung . the latter determines the effective longitudinal dimension of the interaction region for the phase coherence of the radiation process    when external influences are present ( for example , in the form of acoustic waves ) the radius - vector of an atom in the crystal can be written as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 determines the equilibrium positions of the atom in the situation without the deformation , @xmath37 is the displacement of the atom caused by the external influence . in this paper",

    "we will assume that @xmath44 .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath37 in the case of acoustic waves we can disregard , as for the electron energies we are interested in , the characteristic time for the change of the deformation field is much greater than the time of passage of the particles through the crystal . for the deformation field given by eq .",

    "this corresponds to the presence of an additional one - dimensional superlattice with the period @xmath88 and with the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath89 , @xmath90 . in the presence of the deformation field the number of possibilities to satisfy the condition @xmath91 in the summation of formula ( [ sigcohgener ] ) increases due to the term @xmath92 in the expression for @xmath93 .",
