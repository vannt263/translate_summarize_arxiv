    "the chemical abundances of elliptical galaxies have long been known to provide important constraints on theoretical models of their formation .",
    "the metallicities of the stellar populations in elliptical galaxies are estimated observationally from the strength of stellar absorption features in their integrated spectra .",
    "such measurements indicated an increase of the overall metal abundance with galaxy luminosity and velocity dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also an increase in the average mg / fe abundance ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the central regions of most bright ellipticals having above - solar total metallicities and mg / fe ratios ( the so - called _ @xmath0-enhancement _ ) .",
    "the detailed interpretation of line strengths in terms of chemical abundances is , however , complicated , due to the non - solar abundance ratios , and to the dependence of absorption line strengths on both metallicity and age .",
    "detailed stellar population synthesis models have been developed to relate measured absorption line strengths to ages and metallicities ; older models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assumed solar abundance ratios , but newer models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allow for non - solar ratios .",
    "nonetheless , there remain significant uncertainties in going from measured line strengths to abundances of different elements .",
    "most theoretical modelling of chemical abundances in ellipticals has been in the framework of the _ monolithic collapse _ or _",
    "single burst _ model , in which all of the stars form at high redshift in a single burst of short duration , usually terminated by ejection of the remaining gas by a wind , following which the stars evolve passively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that it is possible to explain the trends of both increasing total metallicity and increasing mg / fe ratio with galaxy mass within this framework , provided that the star formation timescale of the initial burst ( a free parameter ) is chosen to have a suitable dependence on galaxy mass .    however , there is now overwhelming evidence that structure in the universe formed by hierarchical clustering of a dominant cold dark matter ( cdm ) component , and strong evidence that galaxy mergers played an important role in the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "galaxy formation within this _ hierarchical merger _",
    "framework has been studied extensively using semi - analytical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . there have , however , been very few detailed studies of the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies within this framework . @xcite and",
    "@xcite computed the relation between total metallicity and luminosity for ellipticals , while @xcite calculated the relation between mg line strength and galaxy velocity dispersion , but these calculations all used the instantaneous recycling approximation for chemical evolution , with fixed solar abundance ratios built in . by construction ,",
    "such models are unable to explain variations in abundance ratios such as mg / fe .",
    "@xcite and @xcite calculated the separate evolution of [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] , including both the prompt metal ejection by type  ii supernovae ( sne  ii ) and the long - delayed ejection by type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) , based on star formation histories taken from a semi - analytical model .",
    "they found in their model that the average [ mg / fe ] actually decreased with increasing luminosity , in apparent conflict with observational data .",
    "however , they calculated chemical evolution using a _ closed - box _ model , which ignored the effects of galaxy mergers and the transport of metals into and out of galaxies by gas inflows and outflows , all of which form part of standard semi - analytical models .    in this paper",
    "we present the first calculations of chemical abundances in elliptical galaxies in a semi - analytical model which includes enrichment by both sne  ia and sne  ii within a fully consistent framework of hierarchical galaxy formation , i.e. including gas inflows and outflows and galaxy mergers .",
    "this enables us to investigate whether hierarchical merger models are able to reproduce the observed variations in the ratio , @xmath0/fe , of @xmath0-elements to iron .",
    "we base our calculations on the semi - analytical model described in @xcite , which assumes that stars formed in bursts triggered by galaxy mergers have a top - heavy imf , while stars formed quiescently in discs have a @xcite imf , similar to the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the top - heavy imf in bursts was introduced in order that the model fit the number counts of faint sub - mm galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that this same model explained the observed abundances in the intracluster medium ( icm ) in galaxy clusters , when enrichment by sne  ia was included .",
    "in the present paper , we compare predictions from the same model with observed abundances of elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite have already shown that a similar hierarchical model is able to explain the abundance patterns in disc galaxies like the milky way .",
    "the general idea that some or all of the stars in elliptical galaxies may have formed with an imf which was top - heavy relative to that in the solar neighbourhood is not a new one .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite all proposed a top - heavy imf as one possible explanation for the abundance patterns observed in ellipticals .",
    "the model presented here is novel in that it is based within a fully consistent hierarchical framework , and in that the parameters of the top - heavy imf and starbursts have been chosen in advance , independently of any metallicity constraints .",
    "we note that there is some more direct evidence for a top - heavy imf in bursts from observations of the starburst galaxy m82 @xcite .",
    "thus , the purpose of this _ letter _ is to investigate theoretical predictions for the metallicities of elliptical galaxies from the same hierarchical galaxy formation model as we used to study the enrichment of the icm in @xcite , and to make a preliminary comparison with observational data . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarise our model .",
    "we present the results from our model in section 3 and our conclusions in section 4 . in the following ,",
    "the cosmological parameters are fixed to be @xmath2 km  s@xmath3mpc@xmath3 = 0.7 and @xmath4 .",
    "we adopt the same model as used in @xcite , which is an extension of the galform semi - analytical galaxy formation model @xcite to include both prompt metal enrichment by sne  ii and delayed enrichment by sne  ia .",
    "the model , which will be described in full in lacey et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) , includes the following physical processes : merging of dark haloes , radiative gas cooling , star formation , sn feedback , mergers of galaxies due to dynamical friction , starbursts triggered by such mergers , and stellar population synthesis .",
    "it has been shown in our previous papers that this model reproduces both the observed sub - mm source counts , and the observed metal abundances and baryon fractions in the icm , provided that a top - heavy imf is adopted for starbursts .",
    "we assume a @xcite imf for quiescent star formation in galaxy discs , which has slope @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 . the top - heavy imf has slope @xmath9 between 0.15 and 120@xmath10 ( where @xmath11 for the salpeter imf ) .    as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the original galform model @xcite , when used with currently estimated cosmlogical parameters , predicted an excessive number of very luminous galaxies at the present epoch . @xcite",
    "considered two alternative solutions to this problem : ( a ) a _ superwind _ model [ similar to @xcite ] , in which sn feedback expels gas from haloes , the expelled gas later being recaptured once the halo grows up to a circular velocity @xmath12 km  s@xmath3 ; ( b ) a _ conduction _ model , in which the conductive heat flux from hot gas in the outer parts of massive haloes prevents gas from cooling in the centres of these haloes .",
    "both models included a top - heavy imf in bursts , and were consistent with metallicities in the icm of clusters .",
    "we present results for both models in this paper . for comparison purposes",
    ", we also show results for a _ superwind / kennicutt _ model , which is identical to our standard superwind model except that a kennicutt imf is used throughout .",
    "we calculate the evolution of the abundances of different elements in the stars and gas using exactly the same prescription for chemical evolution as in @xcite . the rates and chemical yields of sne",
    "ia and sne  ii and gas restitution rates are computed consistently with the adopted imfs based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we compute a total metallicity [ z / h ] and iron abundance [ fe / h ] ( both being expressed as logarithmic values relative to solar ) . for comparing with the observational data",
    ", we also compute an @xmath0-element abundance [ @xmath0/h ] which includes o , mg and other elements which are assumed in observational analyses to vary in step with these - see @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "the @xmath0-abundance is dominated in mass fraction by o. the @xmath0-elements dominate the total metallicity , so [ z / h ] is close to [ @xmath0/h ] .    for comparing with observational data , we also need to compute stellar velocity dispersions of elliptical galaxies in our model .",
    "we compute the radii of stellar spheroids formed in mergers using the method described in @xcite , and we then compute the circular velocity @xmath13 at the half - mass radius of the spheroid including both its self - gravity and the gravity of its dark halo .",
    "we then estimate the 1d stellar velocity dispersion as @xmath14 .",
    "our predictions for the mean global stellar metallicities of ellipticals for the three different models we consider are shown in figs.[fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "we select ellipticals in the model as galaxies with b - band bulge - to - total light ratios @xmath15 .",
    "the metallicities plotted for model galaxies are averages over all of the stars in the galaxy , weighted by the contribution of stars of different ages and metallicities to the v - band luminosity .",
    "this weighting is intended to mimic the measurement of metallicities from spectral features around 5000 .",
    "we have compiled a set of observational data to compare with the models , by combining the samples of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and selecting ellipticals with measurement errors on [ @xmath0/fe ] of less than 0.1 dex .",
    "this leaves us with about 140 ellipticals in a range of environments from groups to clusters , most of them with velocity dispersions in the range @xmath16 .",
    "( we note that a recent paper , @xcite , has reported very similar results to the above papers for much larger samples of 4097 red - sequence galaxies in 93 low - redshift galaxy clusters . ) in the above papers , metallicities have been derived from measured absorption line strengths ( the lick indices ) using stellar population models , assuming that all of the stars in a galaxy have identical ages and metallicities .",
    "the metallicities and velocity dispersions have been estimated from spectra of the central regions of the galaxies .",
    "since there are radial line - strength gradients in elliptical galaxies , the central values differ from the global average values .",
    "based on the gradients measured by @xcite , we estimate that the global total metallicities are typically lower by around 0.25 dex than the central values within 10% of the effective radius .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0/fe ratio does not appear to show significant gradients @xcite .",
    "therefore , in comparing observational data with models , we include downward shifts by 0.25 dex in the observed values of [ @xmath0/h ] and [ fe / h ] , to correct them to global values , but assume that the observed central values of [ @xmath0/fe ] are equal to the global values .",
    "the galaxies in the observational samples are selected in a heterogeneous way . in order to allow a fairer comparison between observations and models in figs.[fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] ,",
    "we have plotted roughly the same number of model galaxies ( @xmath17140 ) as in the observational sample , randomly selected from a volume - limited model catalogue so as to match the distribution of velocity dispersion @xmath18 found in the observational sample .",
    "we note that the model reproduces the observed @xmath19-@xmath18 correlation , where @xmath19 is the total b - band luminosity .",
    "= 0.85    .median of [ @xmath0/h ] , [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] for galaxies with @xmath20 .",
    "values in the brackets represent the width between 25% and 75% values of the distributions . for the observations ,",
    "we show both the measured central values and the estimated global values .",
    "the model values are all global values . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig.[fig : fig1 ] shows [ @xmath0/h ] , [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] plotted against velocity dispersion for the observational sample and for the three models we consider .",
    "the dashed boxes show the parameter region in which most of the observed elliptical galaxies are found , but in the panels showing the models , the boxes are plotted taking into account the estimated correction from central to global metallicities . to allow a more quantitative comparison",
    ", we also give in table  [ tab : tab1 ] the median values and scatter for typical @xmath1 ellipticals , with @xmath21 .",
    "we note the following points : ( 1 ) the observed ellipticals show a large scatter in both abundances ( [ @xmath0/h ] and [ fe / h ] ) and in abundance ratios ( [ @xmath0/fe ] ) at any value of @xmath18 , and this scatter is generally reproduced by the models .",
    "( 2 ) all three models predict similar trends of increasing [ @xmath0/h ] with @xmath18 , which agree with the trend seen in the observations .",
    "( 3 ) however , the overall normalization of [ @xmath0/h ] differs between the models .",
    "when we take metallicity gradients into account , the _ superwind _ model ( with a top - heavy imf in bursts ) seems to be in best agreement with the observed [ @xmath0/h ] ( see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "superwind / kennicutt _ model , which assumes a solar neighbourhood imf for all stars , but is otherwise identical to the _ superwind _ model , predicts the [ @xmath0/h ] values too low by @xmath22 dex .",
    "the _ conduction _ model , which also has a top - heavy imf in bursts , but has less gas and metals ejected from galaxies than in the _ superwind _ model , predicts [ @xmath0/h ] values too high by @xmath22 dex .",
    "( 4 ) the models all predict a trend of [ fe / h ] increasing with @xmath18 , in disagreement with the observational data , which indicate a flat dependence .",
    "( 5 ) the _ superwind _ model predicts [ fe / h ] for @xmath1 galaxies in agreement with observations , when metallicity gradients are taken into account ( see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "the _ superwind / kennicutt _ model predicts only slightly lower [ fe / h ] , showing that the top - heavy imf in bursts affects the @xmath0-abundance more than the fe - abundance .",
    "the _ conduction _",
    "model predicts [ fe / h ] too large by nearly 0.3 dex in @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "( 6 ) the trends for [ @xmath0/fe ] vs. @xmath18 reflect those for [ @xmath0/h ] and [ fe / h ] separately .",
    "the observations indicate a trend of [ @xmath0/fe ] increasing with @xmath18 , while the models all predict a trend in the opposite sense .",
    "both the _ superwind _ and _ conduction _ models predict super - solar [ @xmath0/fe ] values for @xmath1 galaxies ( @xmath23 ) which agree well with observations .",
    "however , none of the models match the typical observed [ @xmath0/fe ] values in high - luminosity ellipticals , with @xmath24 .",
    "the trend we find in our models of the typical [ @xmath0/fe ] decreasing with increasing velocity dispersion or luminosity is similar to what was found by @xcite .",
    "however , although @xcite based their calculations on star formation histories extracted from hierarchical models , they computed the chemical evolution treating each galaxy as a closed box , ignoring galaxy mergers and inflows and outflows of gas and metals .",
    "our calculation does include all of these effects , so our result is a stronger one .",
    "we will compare our results with the closed box result in more detail in a future paper .",
    "in all three models presented here , ellipticals with @xmath25 had around 40% of their star formation occuring in bursts , while the most recent burst typically happened 3 - 7 gyr ago .",
    "= 0.85    in fig.[fig : fig2 ] we plot the @xmath0/fe ratio directly against the fe - abundance , for exactly the same samples of observed and model galaxies as shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we see that the observational data do not show any strong correlation of [ @xmath0/fe ] with [ fe / h ] , but instead show a scatter of 0.4 dex in [ @xmath0/fe ] at a given value of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the models all show a trend of declining [ @xmath0/fe ] with increasing [ fe / h ] , with varying amounts of scatter .",
    "once we include the effect of metallicity gradients on the observational data , the _ superwind _ model seems to be the most consistent with observations , while the _ superwind / kennicutt _ and _ conduction _ models predicts [ @xmath0/fe ] values at a given [ fe / h ] which are respectively too low or too high .",
    "we note here that there is a systematic uncertainty in the [ @xmath0/h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] values obtained from observational data due to _",
    "template bias_. the stellar population models used to derive metallicities and ages from the observed integrated absorption line strengths ( lick indices ) are based on libraries of observed stellar spectra , in which some stars have non - solar @xmath0/fe ratios . if no allowance is made for non - solar @xmath0/fe in the template stellar spectra , then this can bias the determination of [ @xmath0/fe ] and [ @xmath0/h ] from the integrated spectra of galaxies .",
    "however , different authors have made different corrections for this bias , and the issue is currently controversial .",
    "@xcite include an internal correction within their models .",
    "@xcite have instead proposed that the following correction should be applied to [ @xmath0/fe ] values derived from integrated line strengths : @xmath26_{final}}=-0.5{\\rm [ fe / h]+[\\alpha / fe]_{raw}}.\\ ] ] where @xmath27_{raw}}$ ] is the value derived using a stellar population model which ignores the template bias .",
    "a corresponding correction is applied to [ @xmath0/h ] , but no correction is applied to [ fe / h ] .",
    "@xcite found that when this correction is applied to observational data , the [ @xmath0/h]-@xmath18 relation becomes flatter but tighter , while the trend of [ @xmath0/fe ] increasing with @xmath18 almost disappears .",
    "however , @xcite have disputed the validity of this correction and the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "since this correction is controversial , we have plotted all of the observational data in figs.[fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] ( including the data from @xcite and @xcite ) _ without _ including this correction .",
    "however , to show what the effect of making this correction would be , we have plotted in both figures dotted boxes indicating where the observational points would shift to if the correction were applied .",
    "we see that the model predictions in fact agree better with the corrected than uncorrected data , especially for the _ superwind _ model .",
    "we have investigated the metal enrichment of elliptical galaxies in the framework of hierarchical galaxy formation models , taking into account the effects of galaxy mergers and gas inflows and outflows , as well as the production of metals by both sne  ia and sne  ii .",
    "this is the first time this has been done using a semi - analytical model .",
    "our model is the same as that which @xcite used to show that the metallicities of iron and @xmath0 elements in the icm are successfully reproduced only when a top - heavy imf is adopted for starbursts .",
    "we find that all of the models we consider predict correlations of the @xmath0-element abundance with stellar velocity dispersion @xmath18 with similar slopes to what is observed , but the model without a top - heavy imf in bursts ( the _ superwind / kennicutt _ model ) predicts @xmath0-element abundances which are somewhat too low . of our two models which include a top - heavy imf in bursts , the _ superwind _ model predicts @xmath0-element abundances which agree well with observations of bright elllipticals , while the _ conduction _ model ( which has less ejection of gas and metals ) predicts abundances which are too high .",
    "our models with a top - heavy imf also predict [ @xmath0/fe ] values in typical typical @xmath1 ellipticals ( with @xmath28 ) which are similar to observed values , while the model in which all stars form with an imf like that in the solar neighbourhood predicts [ @xmath0/fe ] values which are too low .",
    "however , none of the models reproduce the trend of [ @xmath0/fe ] increasing with @xmath18 which is implied by most observational data .",
    "we note however some caveats to our comparison of the models with observational data : ( i ) the observed metallicities are for the central regions of galaxies , while the models predict global values ; ( ii ) there are uncertainties in the estimation of metallicities from stellar absorption line indices connected with the treatment of non - solar @xmath0/fe abundance ratios ; ( iii ) the models used to estimate metallicities and ages from observed stellar absorption line indices may give biased results if a galaxy contains stars with a mixture of ages and metallicities , rather a single stellar population with a unique age and metallicity .",
    "we plan to address these issues in a future paper , to allow a more detailed test of our models against observational data on ellipticals .",
