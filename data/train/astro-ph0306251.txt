    "however , observations at vhe range are complicated because propagation effects are important for the high energy photons created at cosmological distances @xcite , and also , obviously , because of a low photon statistics in @xmath0-ray telescopes . among the other issues , one should mention here a case of vhe emission from mrk 501 , which extends up to energies @xmath5 tev , which seems to be in conflict with some models of cosmic infrared background ( cib ) radiation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "_ chandra _ x - ray observatory detected about 10 jets displaying the fr i large scale morphology .",
    "they include the ones in radio galaxies m 87 @xcite , centaurus a @xcite , 3c 129 @xcite , 3c 31 @xcite , pks 0521 - 365 @xcite , 3c 270 @xcite , m 84 @xcite , 3c 66b @xcite , b2 0206 + 35 and b2 0755 + 37 @xcite .",
    "all of these objects are located relatively nearby , with a distance ranging from @xmath8 mpc ( centaurus a ) to more than @xmath9 mpc ( pks 0521 - 315 at redshift @xmath10 ) .",
    "all of them share many spectral and morphological similarities briefly summarised below .",
    "x - ray jets in fr i radio sources are usually quite short ( projected length @xmath11 kpc ) .",
    "typically , they are composed of diffusive knots with a spatial scale @xmath12 kpc , although a strong inter - knot emission is also sometimes present .",
    "x - ray jet morphology corresponds _ roughly _ to the radio morphology , and  in cases of m 87 , pks 0521 - 315 , 3c 66b , 3c 31 and b2 0755 + 37 observed by _ hst _  to the optical one .",
    "a noted difference between these pictures are spatial offsets of some knot maxima as measured at x - rays and at radio / optical frequencies ( up to @xmath13 kpc in m 87 , @xmath14 kpc in centaurus a and @xmath15 kpc in 3c 66b ) .",
    "also , x - ray jets ( knots ) seem to be narrower than their radio / optical counterparts ( m 87 , centaurus a ) . except of the weakest and the smallest objects ( 3c 270 and m 84 ) , the observed x - ray luminosities of the discussed jets are @xmath16 erg / s .    in most cases , multiwavelength observations of knot regions in fr i _ chandra",
    "_ jets allow one to construct broad band radio - to - x - ray spectral energy distribution .",
    "all of the inferred knot spectra seem to be similar , and in addition difficult to be explained in a framework of standard jet models . a spectral index of the radio emission ( defined in a way @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the energy flux spectral density ) is always close to @xmath19 .",
    "the optical emission obviously belongs to the synchrotron continuum , with the spectral index steepening between infrared and optical frequencies at about @xmath20 ( 3c 66b , pks 0521 - 315 , m 87 ) .",
    "this agrees well with the x - ray spectral index measured by _",
    "chandra _ , which , for fr i jets , is on average @xmath21 ( ranging from @xmath22 in 3c 31 to @xmath23 in some knots of m 87 and centaurus a ) .",
    "thus , one can generalize , that in the discussed objects the radio - to - optical power - law slope is always less than unity ( @xmath24 ) , while the optical - to - x - ray power - law slope is always much larger ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "such spectral behaviour seems to be universal for all fr i x - ray jets , with a spectral break ( @xmath26 )  where most of the synchrotron ( @xmath27 ) power is emitted  placed usually around @xmath28 hz or , eventually ( m 87 ) , at higher frequencies .    the steep x - ray spectral indices of fr i large scale jets exclude an inverse - compton scattering as a mechanism responsible for the observed x - ray emission . instead , radio - to - x - ray spectral properties indicate synchrotron origin of detected @xmath6 kev photons . if this is the case , than in the discussed objects unknown acceleration process operates , which results in characteristic and _ universal _ for fr i jets electron energy distribution which can be approximated as a broken power - law : @xmath29 where @xmath0 is the electron lorentz factor as well as electron lorentz factors @xmath0 , noting instead that they always refer to the emitting plasma rest frame .",
    "] , @xmath30 is the spectral break in the synchrotron continuum and @xmath31 .",
    "optical and x - ray observations play a crucial role in determining parameters of the above electron spectrum , i.e. its normalisation ( for the assumed energy equipartition between electrons and the jet magnetic field ) and the actual values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which in turn determine the inverse - compton @xmath0-ray jet radiative output . for non - relativistic jet velocities , a typical @xmath34 hz and an equipartition magnetic field @xmath35 g , one gets @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "discussion of the acceleration processes creating such high energy electrons in the fr i jets is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "let us note however , that it is possible for @xmath38 to posses a more complicated form than the one given by equation 1 , involving for example spectral pile - ups at the maximum electron energies due to efficient electron acceleration and rapid radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "in either case , as the observed x - ray luminosity of the fr i kpc - scale jets is lower than the optical luminosity , most of the electrons energy is concentrated in the range near the electron break lorentz factor @xmath32 .",
    "it is interesting to compare @xmath39 characteristic for the kpc - scale fr i jets with critical ( @xmath40 ) synchrotron frequency @xmath41 resulting from the interplay between electron synchrotron cooling and dynamical evolution of the emitting region .",
    "the time scale for the former process can be estimated as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a mean rate of electron energy losses due to synchrotron emission , and @xmath44 denotes comoving jet magnetic field energy density .",
    "the second time scale is simply @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the jet bulk lorentz factor , @xmath47 is a jet bulk velocity and @xmath48 is the distance of the kpc - scale structure from the jet base at @xmath49 from the active galactic nucleus .",
    "a critical electron lorentz factor is defined by an equality @xmath50 .",
    "thus , assuming initial injection of the power - law electron energy distribution at @xmath51 , one expects that at the distance @xmath48 the electron spectrum steepens for @xmath52 because of the efficient radiative cooling of these electrons .",
    "the observed critical synchrotron frequency is then @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the jet doppler factor and @xmath55 is the jet inclination angle to the line of sight . assuming that the jet magnetic field scales with the distance as @xmath56 , what conserves the poynting flux @xmath57 in the expanding jet with an opening angle @xmath58 and a radius @xmath59 , one obtains @xmath60 where we put @xmath61 pc , @xmath62 g and @xmath63 .",
    "note , that with the above values of @xmath64 and @xmath51 characteristic for the blazar sources , the kpc - scale jet magnetic field is expected to be @xmath65 g , consistently with the equipartition value .",
    "hence , in a case of a non - relativistic kpc - scale jet velocity , @xmath66 hz",
    ". however , the spectral break resulting from the considered process is @xmath67 @xcite , i.e. slightly less than the one required for the fr i _ chandra _ jets .",
    "possibly , the observed steep spectral break is a signature of the electron synchrotron cooling in the spatially _ inhomogeneous _ magnetic field @xcite .",
    "note also , that in the cases of relativistic jet bulk velocities , the observed value of @xmath41 can be significantly higher than @xmath68 hz ( cf .",
    "the case of m 87 , section 3.2 ) .",
    "radio observations of fr i jets indicate moderate or even weak beaming ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , one can not exclude possibility that the bulk lorentz factors of kpc - scale jets in weak radio galaxies are of order of a few .",
    "this idea is supported by _",
    "observations of superluminal motions and _ chandra _ detection of significant x - ray variability at kpc - scales in m87 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "in fact , a small number of detected optical and x - ray jets in radio galaxies as compared to the number of known radio jets suggests that relativistic beaming effects can play an important role in these sources @xcite . including a relativistic correction , the electron break lorentz factor is @xmath69 where @xmath70 hz and @xmath71 g.      let us consider a kpc - scale ( @xmath72 kpc ) relativistic jet with the bulk lorentz factor @xmath73 , inclined at an angle @xmath55 to the line of sight .",
    "the energy density of the jet magnetic field , as measured in the emitting region rest frame , is @xmath74 as mentioned above , the equipartition value inferred from the synchrotron emission of fr i knot regions is typically @xmath75 g , and it corresponds to the observed synchrotron jet luminosities @xmath76 erg / s .",
    "the observed luminosity is related to the total emitted synchrotron power @xmath77 by the relation @xmath78 where @xmath79 in cases of a continuous jet ( @xmath80 ) or a moving single radiating blob ( @xmath81 ) , respectively ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also appendix a ) . ] .",
    "below we analyse these both possibilities as limiting models for the kpc - scale knots .",

    "in addition to the synchrotron emission extending to the x - rays , the fr i jets produce also the high energy radiation by inverse - compton scattering of ambient photon fields , like , for example , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation or the synchrotron emission produced by the jet itself . at the kiloparsec distances from the galactic center",
    "another important sources of ambient photons are the active galactic nucleus and the host galaxy .",
    "the agn radiation , produced at small distances from the central region , illuminates the large scale jet almost exactly from behind .",

    "<S> we study production of high energy @xmath0-rays in fr i kiloparsec - scale jets by inverse - compton emission of the synchrotron - emitting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we consider different origin of seed photons contributing to the inverse - compton scattering , including nuclear jet radiation as well as ambient , stellar and circumstellar emission of the host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how future detections or non - detections of the evaluated @xmath0-ray fluxes can provide constraints on the unknown large scale jet parameters , i.e. the magnetic field intensity and the jet doppler factor . </S>",
    "<S> for the nearby sources centaurus a and m 87 , we find measurable fluxes of tev photons resulting from synchrotron self - compton process and from comptonisation of the galactic photon fields , respectively . in the case of centaurus </S>",
