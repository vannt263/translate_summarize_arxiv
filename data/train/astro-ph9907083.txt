    "the differences between these studies are significant and important for our understanding of the nature of submm galaxies .",
    "it is very difficult to achieve high completeness in optical spectroscopic surveys of submm galaxies ( e.g.  barger et al .",
    "1999a ) due to the very different behaviour of the k corrections for distant galaxies between submm and optical passbands .",
    "however , even a crude estimate of the median redshift of a _ complete _ sample of submm galaxies would provide a powerful insight into the relative dominance of obscured and unobscured emission at different epochs ( blain et al .",
    "1999b ) .",
    "in a recent paper , carilli & yun ( 1999 , cy ) demonstrated that using the spectral index between the submm ( 850@xmath1 m ) and radio ( 1.4ghz ) wavebands , @xmath22 , it was possible to obtain crude redshift limits for distant dusty galaxies , irrespective of the nature of the emission mechanism , agn or starburst .",
    "cy employed a number of theoretical and empirical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to investigate the range in @xmath23 for different assumed seds and showed that these models adequately described the small sample of high - redshift galaxies for which both radio and submm observations were available . as pointed out by blain ( 1999 , b99 ) , if we adopt lower dust temperatures for the submm population than are seen in the local sources used in cy s models , then the allowed range of redshifts is slightly lower for a given value of @xmath24 .",
    "nevertheless , the modest scatter between the models in cy suggests that this technique can provide useful limits on the redshifts of submm galaxies in the absence of an optical counterpart .",
    "in this paper we apply the cy analysis to deep radio observations of a complete sample of submm galaxies selected from the scuba cluster lens survey ( smail et al .",
    "our aim is to constrain the redshift distribution of this population and in the process test the optical identifications and spectroscopic redshifts from smail et al .",

    "1999a ; barger et al .",
    "1999a ) , and so we have effectively surveyed an area of about 15arcmin@xmath25 in the source plane to an equivalent @xmath29 sensitivity of 0.7mjy .",
    "the follow - up of these submm sources also benefits from the achromatic amplification , which boosts the apparent brightness of counterparts in all other wavebands .",

    "the size of these error - boxes includes both the systematic and random errors in the source positions and they have been confirmed as realistic using two sources with co interferometric observations ( frayer et al .  1998 , 1999 ) . to assign radio fluxes to the individual submm sources we have adopted the conservative approach of identifying the radio counterpart as the brightest radio source within the submm error - box ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the behaviour of the radio - submm spectral index is such that a brighter radio counterpart leads to a lower redshift estimate .",

    "there are three caveats to bear in mind when using @xmath24 to estimate redshifts for distant galaxies .",
    "first , most of the distant galaxies which cy used to compare with their model predictions show some signs of agn activity . if these agn also contribute to the 1.4-ghz non - thermal emission of the galaxy they will lower the observed @xmath23 values ( as some obviously do in fig .  1a of cy ) .",
    "this will mean that any radio - quiet submm sources could lie at the high end of the predicted @xmath23 range at each epoch .",
    "secondly , the cy and b99 models we use assume effective dust temperatures for the galaxies , @xmath73k .",
    "if the dust in distant obscured galaxies is much cooler then this , it will again shift the predicted redshifts systematically lower ( see b99 ) .",
    "finally , as mentioned in cy , the effects of inverse compton scattering of radio photons off the microwave background may reduce the radio luminosities of star - forming galaxies at @xmath74 and hence increase @xmath23 for the most distant galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the relatively good agreement shown in cy of the spectral indices of distant galaxies with the models is an important confirmation that @xmath23 indices can be used to derive robust lower limits to the redshifts of submm sources without reliable spectroscopic identifications .",
    "we show in fig .  2 three cumulative redshift distributions for the population representing extreme interpretations of the @xmath75 limits from the spectral index models .",

    "barger et al .  ( 1999a ) obtained spectroscopy of most of the possible optical counterparts within each submm error - box .",

    "including the two optical blank - field sources already known ( smail et al .",
    "1998 ) , we conclude that approximately half of the submm population are therefore currently unidentified .",

    ", we find that this distribution is consistent with being drawn from the @xmath24 distribution of the brighter sources with a probability of @xmath81 .",
    "simply comparing the @xmath24 indices for the two subsamples we see that half of the radio - detected bright submm sources have @xmath24 values lower than the lowest limit on the undetected sources , the likelihood that this occurs by chance is only @xmath82 suggesting that there may be real differences between the @xmath24 values for the two subsamples .",
    "several factors could cause this , most simply the apparently fainter submm sources may be at higher redshifts ( a correlation which could naturally exist in a low density universe ) .",
    "alternatively , intrinsic differences in the spectral indices of fainter sources would occur if they contain a lower fraction of radio - loud agn or have typically cooler dust temperatures ( or higher emissivities ) .",

    "<S> we present radio maps from the very large array ( vla ) for 16 sources detected in a sub - millimeter ( submm ) survey of the distant universe . </S>",
    "<S> our deep vla 1.4-ghz maps allow us to identify radio counterparts or place stringent limits ( @xmath0jy in the source plane ) on the radio flux of the submm sources . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the spectral indices of our sources between 850@xmath1 m and 1.4ghz to empirical and theoretical models for distant starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as a function of redshift . in this way we can derive redshift limits for the submm sources , even in the absence of an optical or near - infrared counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the submm population brighter than @xmath2mjy has a median redshift of _ at least _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 , more probably @xmath43 , with almost all galaxies at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is a strong lower limit as both misidentification of the radio counterparts and non - thermal emission from an agn will bias our redshift estimates to lower values . </S>",
    "<S> the high median redshift means that the submm population , if predominately powered by starbursts , contributes a substantial fraction of the total star formation density at high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the spectral index limits with spectroscopic redshifts for proposed optical counterparts to individual submm galaxies suggests that half of the submm sources remain unidentified and thus their counterparts must be fainter than @xmath6 . </S>"
