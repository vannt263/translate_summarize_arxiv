    "as a promising candidate for the future 5 g standard , cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) enables a centralized processing architecture , using multiple relay - like base stations ( bss ) , named remote radio heads ( rrhs ) , to serve mobile users cooperatively under the coordination of a central processor ( cp ) .",
    "the practically achievable throughput of c - ran is largely constrained by the finite - capacity fronthaul links between the rrhs and the cp . in the literature",
    ", a considerable amount of effort has been dedicated to the study of efficient fronthaul techniques @xcite . in the uplink",
    ", the compression - based strategy can be used , where each rrh samples , quantizes and forwards its received signals to the cp over its fronthaul link such that each user s messages can be jointly decoded @xcite .",
    "likewise , in the downlink , the cp can pre - form the beamforming vectors , then compress and transmit the beamformed signals via the fronthaul links to rrhs for coherent transmission @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on these compression - based strategies and reveals an uplink - downlink duality for c - ran .",
    "information theoretically , the uplink of c - ran model corresponds to a multiple - access relay channel , while the downlink corresponds to a broadcast relay channel .",
    "when the fronthaul links have infinite capacities , the c - ran model reduces to a multiple - access channel ( mac ) in the uplink , and a broadcast channel ( bc ) in the downlink , for which there is a well - known uplink - downlink duality , i.e. , the achievable rate regions with linear beamforming or the entire capacity regions of the mac and the dual bc are identical under the same sum - power constraint @xcite@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we extend such an uplink - downlink duality relationship to the c - ran model where the fronthaul capacities are finite .",
    "we show that if independent compression is applied across each rrh , the achievable rate regions of the uplink and downlink c - ran are identical under the same sum - power and the same individual fronthaul capacity constraints when all the terminals are equipped with a single antenna .",
    "specifically , given any downlink ( uplink ) power assignment , transmit ( receive ) beamforming and quantization noise levels , we construct the corresponding respective uplink ( downlink ) power assignment , receive ( transmit ) beamforming and quantization noise levels such that each user s access rate , each rrh s fronthaul rate , as well as the sum - power are all preserved .",
    "based on this duality result , we further show that the downlink sum - power minimization problem can be efficiently solved based on its uplink counterpart .",
    "although this paper focuses on the compression - based strategies for c - ran , we remark that other coding strategies can potentially outperform the compression strategy for certain channel parameters .",
    "for example , the so - called `` compute - and - forward '' and `` reverse compute - and - forward '' strategies have been applied for the uplink and downlink c - ran , respectively , where linear functions of transmitted codewords are computed and then sent between the rrhs and cp @xcite . moreover , in the downlink , the cp may opt to share user data directly with the rrhs @xcite . however , the capacity of the uplink and downlink c - ran model is still an open problem .",
