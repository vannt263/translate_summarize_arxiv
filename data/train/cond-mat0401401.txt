    "during the last decade considerable effort has been devoted to simulational and experimental verification of the mode coupling theory ( mct ) of glassy dynamics and the glass transition @xcite .",
    "the consensus that emerged from this work is that mct describes in a satisfactory way `` weakly '' supercooled liquids ( _ i.e. _ it describes the first few decades of slowing down on approaching the glass transition ) . in particular , mct has been quite successful when applied to concentrated colloidal suspensions @xcite , the colloidal glass @xcite , and gelation @xcite transitions .",
    "notably , less effort has been devoted to the foundations of the mode coupling theory ( see , however , refs .",
    "this is somewhat surprising in view of mct s several well - known problems .",
    "the most important , fundamental problem is the uncontrolled nature of the basic mct approximation : factorization of a complicated _ time - dependent _ pair - density ( _ i.e. _ four - particle ) correlation function .",
    "recently , we proposed an extension of mct for dynamics of colloidal suspensions and the colloidal glass transition @xcite .",
    "our theory includes , in an approximate way , time - dependent pair - density fluctuations .",
    "it relies upon a factorization approximation that is similar to that used in mct , but is applied at a level of a memory function for the time - dependent pair - density correlation function .",
    "the theory predicts an ergodicity breaking transition similar to that of mct , but at a higher density .",
    "thus it partially solves another well - known mct problem : overestimation of so - called dynamic feedback effect and the resulting underestimation of the colloidal glass transition density .    here ,",
    "for a simpler , toy model , we go further : we completely avoid using factorization approximation for any _ dynamic _ correlation function .",
    "we only assume gaussian factorization of _ static _ correlations @xcite . it should be noted that a frequently used approach to glassy dynamics is to start from a set of fluctuating hydrodynamics equations which are supplemented by a quadratic free energy implying gaussian static density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we argue that the analysis presented here has implications for such models .",
    "since the approach is technically quite involved , we state the main results immediately : we derive an essentially exact expression for the time - integrated memory function for a single brownian particle moving among immobile obstacles .",
    "we compare this expression with one derived from mct and show that the latter includes a subset of the former s terms : only explicitly positive terms from the exact series ( _ i.e. _ the terms that always increase the effective friction felt by the mobile particle ) are included within mct .",
    "this is the origin of mct s overestimation of the dynamic feedback effect .",
    "an approximate re - summation of the exact series suggests that , under the assumption of gaussian static fluctuations , the mobile particle s motion is always diffusive .",
    "in contrast , mct predicts that the mobile particle becomes localized at high enough obstacle density .",
    "this result has important consequences for models used to study glassy dynamics .",
    "we show here that , if static correlations are gaussian , a single mobile particle is never localized by immobile obstacles .",
    "this suggests that a similar _ fully mobile _ system ( _ i.e. _ gaussian static correlations and all particles diffusing ) can not undergo an ergodicity breaking transition . in other words",
    ", the ergodicity breaking transition predicted for such a system by a mode coupling theory is , most probably , an artifact of the factorization approximation .    note that this does _ not _ mean that mct is qualitatively wrong for a system with complicated many - particle static correlations ( like , _",
    "e.g. _ , the hard sphere system ) .",
    "it can be argued that terms that cut - off mct s localization transition ( _ i.e. _ terms that are neglected in mct ) are canceled by other terms that originate from non - gaussian static correlations .",
    "indeed , empirical success of mct for colloidal systems suggests that this might be the case .",
    "it is at present unclear how to describe this remarkable cancellation .",
    "we consider one spherical brownian particle diffusing between @xmath0 immobile , spherically symmetric obstacles .",
    "the particle interacts with the obstacles via a potential @xmath1 .",
    "the obstacles are mechanically identical to the mobile particle .",
    "we assume that the initial joint probability distribution for the mobile particle and the obstacles is given by the equilibrium canonical distribution at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the time evolution of the system is described by a generalized smoluchowski equation : @xmath3 with the initial condition @xmath4 here @xmath5 denotes the position of the mobile particle and @xmath6 denote positions of the obstacles .",
    "furthermore , @xmath7 is the diffusion coefficient of the mobile particle in the absence of the obstacles , and @xmath8 is the force acting on it . finally , the second line in eq .",
    "( [ nsm ] ) defines the @xmath9-particle generalized smoluchowski operator @xmath10 .",
    "our theory starts from the memory function representation of the mobile particle density correlation function , @xmath11 , @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the fourier transform of the mobile particle density , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes the average over the equilibrium probability distribution , @xmath16 .",
    "note the equilibrium distribution stands to the right of the quantity being averaged , and all operators act on it as well as on everything else .    to derive the memory function representation we start from an expression for the laplace transform , @xmath17 , of the time derivative of @xmath18 : @xmath19 using standard projection operator manipulations",
    "we rewrite ( [ fktder ] ) in the following form : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a projected current density of the mobile particle , @xmath22 @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a projection operator on the mobile particle density subspace , @xmath25 note that in eq . ( [ p1 ] ) we introduced a summation convention : we sum over all repeated wavevectors appearing in adjacent _ ket _ , @xmath26 , and _ bra _ , @xmath27 .",
    "next we define the one - particle irreducible evolution operator , @xmath28 and we use the same standard projection operator manipulations to re - write the current - current correlation function appearing in eq .",
    "( [ fktmr ] ) in the following form : @xmath29 combining eqs .",
    "( [ fktmr ] ) and ( [ fktmr2 ] ) we derive the memory function representation for @xmath30 : @xmath31 comparing eq .",
    "( [ fktm ] ) with the standard form of the memory function representation , @xmath32 we identify the irreducible memory function : @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "next we define @xmath35 : the part of the joint density of the mobile particle and the obstacles that is orthogonal to the mobile particle s density , @xmath36 we use the following identity that is exact for two - particle additive interactions : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the kernel of the inverse integral operator . using eq .",
    "( [ vertex1 ] ) and an analogous identity for @xmath39 we can express the irreducible memory function ( [ m1irr ] ) in terms of the pair - density correlation function : @xmath40 in turn , this correlation function can be subjected to the same manipulations as the mobile particle density correlation function @xmath11 .",
    "re - tracing the steps between eqs .",
    "( [ fktdef ] ) and ( [ fktm ] ) we arrive at the following : @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the two - particle projected current density , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the two - particle irreducible evolution operator , @xmath45 in eqs .",
    "( [ j2][o2 ] ) @xmath46 , with @xmath24 defined by eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) , and @xmath47 being projection operator on @xmath35 : @xmath48    combining eqs .",
    "( [ m1irr ] ) , ( [ vertex1 ] ) and ( [ f2ktm2 ] ) we can obtain an expression for the memory function in terms of the autocorrelation function of the two - particle projected current density : @xmath49 note that to get expression ( [ m1irr2 ] ) we resorted to a technical approximation that is similar to the first enskog approximation used to approximately invert the boltzmann collision operator @xcite .",
    "this minor , technical approximation is not required in one dimension where eq .",
    "( [ m1irr2 ] ) is exact .",
    "it is clear this procedure can be continued _",
    "ad infinitum _ : the two - particle projected current correlation function can be expressed in terms of the three - body density correlation function , _ etc . _",
    "( note that for higher order densities , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , it is advantageous to use ordered multiplets of wavevectors , @xmath52 ) .",
    "this is somewhat akin to the well - known continuous fraction expansion .",
    "it is different from it in that at each step a new function depending on a larger number of variables is introduced .",
    "the resulting expressions simplify greatly if we assume gaussian factorization of static correlations .",
    "note that operators @xmath53 remove contributions involving fewer than @xmath54 independent connections between two groups of particles @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , for the correlations of the projected @xmath55-particle density we get @xmath56 furthermore , for the density - current correlations of the type ( [ vertex1 ] ) we get @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number density , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the direct correlation function , @xmath61 .    using the above described procedure , under the assumption of static gaussian fluctuations , we get the following expression for the time - integrated ( _ i.e. _ @xmath62 ) memory function at @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes all permutations of the wavevectors indices . eq .",
    "( [ mseries ] ) is the main result of this note . under the assumption of static gaussian correlations ,",
    "this expression is essentially exact .",
    "the only , technical approximation is the one similar to the first enskog approximation .",
    "expression ( [ mseries ] ) should be compared with that resulting from the mode coupling theory .",
    "the latter approach starts from expression ( [ m1irr ] ) for the memory function , rewrites it in terms of the pair density correlation function using ( [ vertex1 ] ) and ( [ f2kt ] ) , and then resorts to a factorization approximation @xcite .",
    "this procedure gives the following expression for the memory function : @xmath66 using eq .",
    "( [ mmct ] ) we can obtain a series expression for mct s time - integrated memory function .",
    "we notice that @xmath67 and iterate ( [ mmct ] ) to get @xmath68 where we wrote the resulting series in a form similar to ( [ mseries ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that from each term of ( [ mseries ] ) the mct expression ( [ mmctseries ] ) includes only these terms that are explicitly positive definite .",
    "we suggest that the difference between the two expressions is the origin of mct s well - known overestimation of so - called dynamic feedback effect .    to investigate this last issue further we attempt to re - sum the expression ( [ mseries ] ) .",
    "to this end we resort to an approximation which simplifies angular dependence of individual terms in series ( [ mseries ] ) .",
    "this approximation will be motivated in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "after the approximation we obtain @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes dimensionality of the space .",
    "one should note that eq .",
    "( [ mseriesapp ] ) reproduces exactly the first two terms in series ( [ mseries ] ) .",
    "also , eq . ( [ mseriesapp ] ) is exact in one dimension .    using ( [ mseriesapp ] )",
    "we obtain the following simple formula for the mobile particle s diffusion coefficient : @xmath71 it is clear that , for a generic interaction potential , the mobile particle s motion is always diffusive ; _ i.e. _ the mobile particle is never localized .",
    "one should also note a striking resemblance between ( [ d ] ) and deem and chandler s result @xcite for the diffusion coefficient of a single particle in gaussian random media ( note that @xmath72 is the effective mobile particle - obstacle interaction potential @xcite ) .",
    "comparison with numerical simulations of diffusion in gaussian random media showed that the latter result is extremely accurate .",
    "in contrast , for a generic interaction potential , mct s equation ( [ mmct ] ) ( supplemented by the memory function representation for @xmath30 ) predicts that at sufficiently high obstacle density mobile particle s diffusion coefficient vanishes and the particle gets localized .",
    "it should be emphasized that the absence of the localization transition within the full theory and the resulting stark discrepancy with mct is independent of the approximation leading to eq .",
    "( [ mseriesapp ] ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient in @xmath70 dimensions is bounded from below by the @xmath73 diffusion coefficient @xcite . in one dimension the series ( [ mseries ] ) can be re - summed without difficulty .",
    "the result is given by formula ( [ d ] ) with @xmath73 .",
    "we showed here that , under the assumption of gaussian factorization of static fluctuations , a single diffusing particle is never mobilized by immobile obstacles . in contrast , mct predicts localization at a high enough obstacle density .",
    "one should notice that in some cases , _",
    "e.g. _ for a hard sphere diffusing among immobile hard spheres , we expect the mobile particle to get localized at sufficiently high obstacle density .",
    "our result suggests that this localization is intimately connected to non - gaussian character of _ static _ density fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , mct implicitly assumes gaussian factorization but it neglects terms that cut off the localization transition .",
    "it would be of great interest to investigate whether in a more accurate theory these terms are canceled by terms originating from non - gaussian character of static density fluctuations .",
    "finally , our results suggest that theories based on gaussian density correlations are not suitable for description of the glass transition .",
