    "the electric dipole is a fundamental concept in describing the response of a material to an electric field.@xcite spontaneously - emerging electric dipoles are of particular importance in the field of modern electronics .",
    "ferroelectric materials that show spontaneous electric dipoles below a transition temperature @xmath3 have been used in applications such as high - density , non - volatile memories.@xcite in conventional ferroelectric materials , two kinds of electric dipoles are recognized .",
    "one is a displacement type , in which cations shift relative to anions below @xmath3 .",
    "the other is an order - disorder type , in which polar molecules are randomly oriented above @xmath3 , and align below @xmath3 . batio@xmath2 and nano@xmath1 are typical examples of the former and the latter types , respectively.@xcite recently , a third type of ferroelectricity was noted in the layered iron oxide lufe@xmath1o@xmath4 , in which the electric dipole comes from the ordering of the fe@xmath5 and fe@xmath6 ions on a double - layered triangular lattice.@xcite these dipoles are understood in terms of atomic positions in the crystal of interest .",
    "here we show a truly electronic type of electric dipole in the organic salt @xmath7-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 , where bedt - ttf stands for bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene .",
    "@xmath7-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 is known as a dimer mott insulator,@xcite and has been investigated as an ideal candidate for a spin - liquid state.@xcite this organic salt is a layered compound in which the bedt - ttf and cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 layers are alternately stacked along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "the bedt - ttf layer is responsible for the electrical and magnetic response , while the cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 layer only acts to electro - statically stabilize the crystal .",
    "the greek letter @xmath7 specifies a packing pattern of the bedt - ttf molecules , which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . in this pattern",
    ", hole exists per two dimerized molecules as indicated by the red dotted ellipsoids .",
    "thus , if one regards the two molecules as a sort of `` atom '' represented by the closed circles in fig .",
    "1(b ) , one can identify this bedt - ttf layer with a `` half - filled '' system in which one hole is localized on each site.@xcite this system meets the definition of a mott insulator , hence the name `` dimer mott insulator . ''",
    "the spin degrees of freedom on each localized hole acts as a magnetic dipole as shown in fig .",
    "the magnetic dipoles interact via a superexchange interaction @xmath9250 k , but an antiferromagnetic transition does not take place above 32 mk , owing to the frustration coming from the geometry of the triangular lattice based on dimers . to be more precise , recent ab - initio calculations reveal that the dimer network can not be regarded as a regular triangle in which the anisotropy of the transfer integral reaches 0.8 , but still the spin system is in the frustrated region.@xcite this lack of long range order of the magnetic dipoles defines a spin liquid.@xcite    we have found that @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 exhibits dielectric relaxation below around 60 k , which is not expected from the charge excitations in conventional mott insulators .",
    "based on the extended hubbard model , we ascribe this to the charge disproportionation within the dimer driven by the intersite coulomb interaction .",

    "electric displacement - electric field ( @xmath12 ) curves were measured with a homemade apparatus based on the sawyer - tower circuit @xcite with a maximum electrical field of 1000 v. the measurement direction was set to be perpendicular to the bedt - ttf layer ( along the @xmath8 axis ) , because a dielectric constant can not be measured precisely for conductive media.@xcite the cross - plane resistivity is much higher than the in - plane one , and the contact resistance was safely neglected .",
    "we should note that the temperature and frequency dependence of @xmath10 is similar between the in- and cross - plane directions of layered materials , so that the ac response of a two - dimensional dielectric material can be discussed from the cross - plane measurement at least qualitatively.@xcite the magnitudes of @xmath10 are even close in some materials such as lufe@xmath1o@xmath4.@xcite    -(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 along the a - axis ( cross - plane ) direction at various frequencies as a function of temperature .",

    "figure 2(a ) shows the dielectric constant with respect to various frequencies plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "the dielectric constant increases with decreasing temperature below 60 k , and simultaneously begins to show frequency dependence .",
    "as temperature is lowered , the dielectric constant goes through a broad maximum at a temperature @xmath13 depending on the measurement frequency @xmath14 , then decreases toward 2.1 - 2.5 .",
    "@xmath13 corresponds to a crossover temperature below which the response to the changing electric field begins to lag .",
    "the ac conductivity also shows frequency dependence as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) . in this case , the frequency dependence becomes significant below around 40 k , which is lower than that for the dielectric constant .",
    "roughly speaking , we see that the ac conductivity bends around @xmath13 and remains higher than the conductivities at lower frequencies .",
    "the dielectric relaxation we observe is indeed unconventional .",
    "first , the charge degrees of freedom is believed to be insubstantial in the mott insulator , but the increasing dielectric constant below 60 k indicates the existence of randomly oriented electric dipoles as shown in fig .",
    "secondly , the dielectric relaxation implies collective motion of the electric dipoles .",

    ", width=226 ]    similar relaxation behavior is widely observed in disordered systems such as glass - forming liquids , spin-/cluster - glasses , and relaxor ferroelectrics .",
    "the measurement frequency is plotted as a function of @xmath16 in fig .",
    "@xmath3 is the transition temperature , which we assume to be 6 k because the specific heat,@xcite the thermal conductivity,@xcite and the thermal expansion coefficient@xcite show anomaly at this temperature .",
    "the data are roughly linear , which suggests that the vogel - fulcher law @xmath20 $ ] consistently explains the frequency dependence of @xmath13 .",
    "since the vogel - fulcher law is widely observed in glass - forming liquid,@xcite spin-/cluster - glasses,@xcite and relaxor ferroelectrics,@xcite it is natural to conclude that the dielectric relaxation comes from disordered arrangements of the electric dipoles .",
    "the values of @xmath17 and @xmath21 are evaluated to be @xmath19 hz and 250 k , respectively .",
    "we should emphasize that @xmath17 is significantly smaller than a typical value of @xmath22 hz for relaxor ferroelectric materials.@xcite the physical meaning of @xmath23 is a typical time scale for ac response in the high temperature limit , which should be longer in domain motions than in individual motions .",
    "it is known for magnetic systems that cluster glass materials ( where ferromagnetic domains are randomly oriented ) tend to show smaller values of @xmath17 than spin glass materials ( where individual spins are randomly oriented).@xcite in this respect , we think that the polar domains are disordered rather than the individual electric dipoles . similar disorder is reported in magnetic resonance experiments,@xcite and may be related to the suppression of the long range order of magnetic moments .",
    "it is well known that disorder in the terminal ethylene group seriously affects the physical properties in some ( bedt - ttf)-type organic salts .",
    "some physical quantities such as superconducting @xmath3 significantly depend on the cooling rate.@xcite theoretically , this type of disorder can be a pair breaker of superconductivity,@xcite and modifies the intra - dimer coulomb interaction.@xcite we performed dielectric measurements with different cooling rates ranging from 0.5 to 10 k / min , and found that the data were essentially the same as in fig .",

    "we further measured the dielectric response for a deuterated sample , and found that the data were again essentially the same ( not shown ) .",
    "these results indicate that the observed dielectric relaxation does not come from the disordered arrangements of the hydrogen bonding in the terminal ethylene group . in this context",
    ", we can say that the single crystal used here contains no substantial lattice defects or disorder , as pure as crystals of other organic salts . in relaxor ferroelectric materials , in contrast ,",

    ", width=302 ]    although no clear phase transition is observed in the thermodynamic quantities of this material , one may find a trace of a transition temperature .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the inverse dielectric constant as a function of temperature .",
    "these data are plotted after subtracting the dielectric constant at 1.2 k as the temperature - independent part .",
    "the dielectric constant below 60 k obeys the curie - weiss law , i.e. , it is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath26 with @xmath276 k. as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , around @xmath3 , the dielectric constant has an anomaly that is almost independent of frequency . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3(b ) , the electric displacement @xmath24 shows no remnant polarization below 6 k , indicating that the ordering of the electric dipoles is of antiferroelectric type .",
    "we propose a microscopic origin of this antiferroelectric response .",
    "the extended hubbard model based on the bedt - ttf molecular orbitals is a widely accepted model for this family of organic materials , which consists of transfer integral , on - site coulomb repulsion , and inter - site coulomb repulsion terms.@xcite owing to the large transfer integrals and coulomb repulsion between the dimerized molecules , an electron on a dimer is described by the superposition of two quantum states expressed by @xmath28 with the coefficients @xmath29 as shown in fig .",
    "here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the wavefunctions of the dimerized a and b molecules .",
    "the electron on the dimer thus fluctuates between a and b , rather than staying statically at the center of the dimer . on the other hand ,",
    "the inter - dimer coulomb repulsion polarizes the dimers ( i.e. unequalizes @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) such that the electrons on neighboring dimers stay apart as far as possible . when these two electrons come close [ figs .",
    "4(b ) and ( c ) ] , the repulsion is higher than when they are far apart [ figs . 4(d ) and ( e ) ] . in this way ,",
    "the intra - dimer quantum fluctuation and the dipole - dipole interaction compete .",
    "in related organic conductors of one dimension , the same sort of interaction induces a ferroelectric transition.@xcite owing to the zig - zag packing of bedt - ttf molecules , the dipole - dipole interaction becomes relatively small , and concomitantly the intra - dimer quantum fluctuation is dominant , allowing the effects of dipole - dipole interaction to remain as short range correlations . as a result , the system goes back and forth between two configurations ; figs .",
    "4(f ) and ( g ) show two snapshots of the quantum fluctuation coupled with the inversion symmetry .",
    "our model suggests that the charge ordering instability survives in @xmath7(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 .",
    "this is reasonable ; depending on the degree of dimerization , the ground state of the quarter - filled organic salts can be continuously changed from the charge ordered insulator to the dimer mott insulator.@xcite these two pictures are extreme limits , and real materials lie in between .",
    "detailed theoretical study on this picture is written separately,@xcite based on the model including the transverse ising term which accounts for the charge degrees of freedom , and the kugel - khomskii - term describing the couplings of spin and charges .",
    "motivated by our experiment , naka and ishihara,@xcite in parallel with ref .",
    ", also calculated the mean - field phase diagram on the similar model , and successfully explained a possible existence of a ferroelectric charge order .",
    "it should be noted that before our experimental study , clay and his coworkers @xcite have discussed the physical properties of the organic salts in terms of electron - paired crystal , and already predicted that the charge ordering pattern is hidden in the title compound .",
    "actually , their predicted pattern is similar to figs .",
    "5(f ) and 5(g ) .",
    "we can understand the dielectric response qualitatively using the above concept .",
    "this electric dipole is tightly bound to the molecular arrangement , fluctuating collectively within a certain length scale .",
    "when an external electric field is applied , such collective dynamical domains easily obey the external field , retaining an inhomogeneous nature .",
    "thus a mean square value of @xmath34 is induced by the external field , where @xmath35 is proportional to the difference of the electron densities @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the distance between the a and b molecules . from the slope in fig .",
    "3(a ) , @xmath39 is evaluated to be 0.1@xmath40 .",
    "of course , the above estimate of @xmath38 and @xmath39 came from the oversimplified picture . in the present experiment ,",
    "the dipole moments tend to align perpendicular to the bedt - ttf layer , and the charge should be polarized along the bedt - ttf molecule .",
    "we should note that the the charge distribution of the @xmath41 electrons on the molecule is about @xmath42  , which is the same length scale as the inter - molecular distance .",
    "thus we believe that the estimated charge disproportionation of 0.1@xmath40 will not be off the mark . finally , we briefly add some notes on the nature of this dielectric relaxation .",
    "( i ) the dielectric constant at 1 mhz above 10 k is independent of dc bias up to 2 kv / cm .",
    "this makes a remarkable contrast to relaxor ferroelectric materials @xcite or internal barrier - layer capacitors,@xcite and excludes a possibility for extrinsic origins @xcite ( ii ) the dielectric response is also independent of magnetic field up to 15 t , and represents a remarkable contrast to multiglass or multiferroic materials.@xcite ( iii ) we observed similar dielectric relaxation in @xmath43-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1.@xcite this clearly indicates that this type of electric dipoles widely exists in dimerized bedt - ttf molecules , and reveals the importance of the charge degrees of freedom in such systems .",
    "in summary , we have measured the dielectric constant of the dimer mott insulator @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 , and have found anomalous dielectric relaxation below around 60 k. this relaxation resembles that of relaxor ferroelectric materials , which strongly suggests the existence of interacting electric dipoles .",
    "this electric dipole is ascribed to the charge disproportionation within the bedt - ttf dimers driven by the intermolecular coulomb interaction .",
    "we have evaluated the charge disproportionation to be 0.1@xmath40 from the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant .",
    "the present results indicate that nontrivial charge degrees of freedom survive in the dimer mott insulator , which may be related to the characteristic properties of this family such as pressure - induced superconductivity .",
