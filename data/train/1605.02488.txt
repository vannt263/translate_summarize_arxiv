    "the relevant role that weak @xmath0-decay and electron - capture ( ec ) processes play in our understanding of the late stages of the stellar evolution has been long recognized @xcite . in particular , the presupernova stellar structure , as well as",
    "the nucleosynthesis of heavier nuclei , are determined to a large extent by those mechanisms .",
    "_ pf_-shell nuclei are specially important in these scenarios because they are the main constituents of the stellar core in presupernova formations @xcite leading to core - collapse ( type ii ) or thermonuclear ( type ia ) supernovae .",
    "type ii supernovae are thought to be the final result of the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star that takes place when the nuclear fuel exhausts . in the initial stages of the collapse ,",
    "electrons are captured by nuclei in the iron - nickel mass region , thus reducing the electron - to - baryon fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the presupernova star and correspondingly the degeneracy pressure . at the same time , at typical presupernova densities , the neutrinos generated in those captures can leave the star , reducing the energy and cooling the star .",
    "both effects help to accelerate the stellar collapse .",
    "ec processes are therefore essential ingredients to follow the complex dynamics of core - collapse supernova , and reliable estimates of these rates certainly contribute to a better understanding of the explosion mechanism .",
    "network calculations and astrophysical simulations @xcite require nuclear physics input that in most cases can not be measured directly in the laboratory due to the extreme conditions of densities ( @xmath3 ) and temperatures ( t ) holding in stellar scenarios .",
    "therefore , nuclear properties , and in particular the gamow - teller ( gt ) transitions that determine to a large extent the decay properties , must be estimated in many cases by model calculations .",
    "a strong effort has been made in the last decades to measure the gt strength distributions of nuclei in the mass region @xmath4 .",
    "this has been performed by means of @xmath5 or equivalent higher resolution charge - exchange reactions such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 at forward angles @xcite .",
    "these reactions are the most efficient way to extract the gt strength in stable nuclei @xcite .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "the first extensive calculations of stellar weak rates in relevant ranges of @xmath3 and t were done in ref .",
    "@xcite under severe assumptions concerning the energy distribution of the gt strength . in ref .",
    "@xcite the whole gt strength was assumed to be concentrated in a single resonance at an energy parametrized phenomenologically .",
    "the total gt strength was taken from the single - particle model . since then",
    ", improvements in the weak rates have been focused on the description of the nuclear structure aspect of the problem .",
    "different approaches are found in the literature that can be roughly divided into shell model ( sm ) @xcite and proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite categories .",
    "hybrid models using rpa methods on top of a temperature - dependent description of the parent nucleus using a shell - model monte carlo approach have been also developed to calculate stellar ec rates @xcite .",
    "although qrpa calculations can not reach the detailed spectroscopic accuracy achieved by present state - of - the - art sm calculations , the global performance of qrpa is quite satisfactory .",
    "moreover , one clear advantage of the qrpa method is that it can be extended to heavier nuclei , which are beyond the present capability of full sm calculations , without increasing the complexity of the calculation .",
    "a systematic evaluation of the ability to reproduce the measured gt strength distributions of various theoretical models based on sm and qrpa was done in ref .",
    "ec rates were also derived from those models at astrophysical conditions of @xmath3 and t. in ref .",
    "@xcite sm calculations using different effective interactions were compared with data and with qrpa of ref .",
    "@xcite . later in ref .",
    "@xcite the same results were also compared with qrpa calculations using a skyrme selfconsistent mean field and qrpa with residual interactions in both particle - hole ( ph ) and particle - particle ( pp ) channels , improving significantly the agreement with experiment .",
    "it is important to realize that there are clear differences between terrestrial and stellar decay rates caused by the effect of high @xmath3 and t conditions .",
    "one effect of t is directly related to the thermal population of excited states in the decaying nucleus , accompanied by the corresponding depopulation of the ground states .",
    "the weak rates of excited states can be significantly different from those of the ground state and a case by case consideration is needed .",
    "another distinctive effect comes from the fact that atoms in stellar scenarios are completely ionized , and consequently electrons are no longer bound to the nuclei , but forming a degenerate plasma that obeys a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "this opens the possibility for continuum ec , in contrast to the orbital ec caused by bound electrons in the atom under terrestrial conditions .",
    "these two effects make weak - interaction rates in the stellar interior sensitive functions of t and @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to these genuine stellar effects , one has to deal with uncertainties in the extraction of the experimental gt strength due to several causes such as the global normalization of the unit cross section , or to possible interference effects caused by the tensor component of the interaction .",
    "one has to take also into account that the gt strength is only measured up to some excitation energy and therefore the rates calculated from it will not include possible contributions from transitions beyond the measured energy range that could have an effect , especially at high t and @xmath3 .",
    "the measured gt strength distributions are then strict tests to constrain the theoretical ones under terrestrial conditions , but the rates calculated from the experimental gt strength distributions may still differ significantly from the actual rates operating in stars .",
    "the nuclei under study in this work correspond in most cases to stable _",
    "pf_-shell nuclei and @xmath8 decays from their ground states are energetically forbidden .",
    "however , as t raises , thermal population of excited states in the parent nucleus may induce @xmath9 decays if the energy excitation in the parent nucleus exceeds the @xmath10 energy .",
    "these decays , which are almost independent of @xmath3 and t , might compete with ecs in particular cases .",

    "@xcite the eventual contributions from excited states could be safely neglected because of the high energy excitation of the first excited states , typically @xmath12 states beyond 1 mev that can hardly be excited within the range of temperatures considered in this work .",
    "however , low - lying excited states would contribute to the rates in the case of even - even well deformed nuclei @xcite , where the rotational states drop easily below 1 mev , as well as in odd-@xmath1 nuclei where quasiparticle states are found at very low excitation energies .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to study these contributions to the weak rates coming from low - lying excited states in odd-@xmath1 nuclei .    to perform this study ,",
    "a set of nuclei has been chosen according to their interest in presupernova models @xcite .",

    "this grid of @xmath112 and @xmath29 includes those ranges relevant for astrophysical scenarios related to the silicon - burning stage in a presupernova star @xcite ( @xmath115 mol/@xmath64 and @xmath116 ) , as well as scenarios related to pre - collapse of the core @xcite and thermonuclear runaway type ia supernova @xcite ( @xmath117 mol/@xmath64 and @xmath110 ) .    in these ranges of densities and temperatures ,",
    "weak - interaction rates are fully dominated by ec .",
    "@xmath8-decays will always contribute for sufficiently high @xmath3 and @xmath29 because of thermal population of excited states beyond @xmath33 energies .",
    "however , for @xmath3 and t values in this work , positron - decay contributions can be neglected .",
    "the most favored cases for @xmath8 contributions are those with positive @xmath33 values that correspond to @xmath15fe and @xmath16fe .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ beta_ec_fe53 ] the decomposition of the total weak - interaction rates in @xmath15fe into their ec and @xmath8 components .",
    "at @xmath81 there is a competition between ec and @xmath8 at low t. at higher t , ec clearly dominates because it increases while @xmath8 remains almost constant . at higher densities , the electron chemical potential increases and the electron fermi - dirac distribution ( [ se ] ) allows for higher energy electrons with the result of a remarkably enhanced ec rate . on the contrary , the @xmath8 phase - space factor in eq .",
    "( [ phiec ] ) remains invariant with the density and so does the corresponding @xmath8 rate .",
    "the final result is that @xmath8 is always very small in comparison with ec and can be safely neglected . the dominant ec determines the total rates in practically all the cases .",
    "therefore , only the total rates will be shown in the following figures .    figs .",
    "[ dens_sc45 ] - [ dens_fe57 ] show the total rates as a function of the temperature for various densities from @xmath118 up to @xmath114 mol/@xmath64 . in these figures",
    "one can see that the rates always increase when either @xmath3 or t increases .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the phase factors that increase accordingly .",
    "the sensitivity of the ec rates to the environmental @xmath119 conditions is obvious . at low @xmath3 ( low fermi energies ) and low @xmath29 ( sharp shape of the energy distribution of the electrons @xmath56 ) , the rates are low and very sensitive to details of the gt strength of the low - lying excitations and therefore to nuclear structure model calculations . on the other hand , when @xmath3 increases ( larger fermi energies ) and @xmath29 increases ( smearing of the electron distribution functions ) , ec rates also increase and become sensitive to all the spectrum , in particular , to the centroids of the gt strength distribution and to the total strength .",
    "then , the whole description of the gt strength distribution is more important than a detailed description of the low - lying spectrum .",
    "this is also the reason why all the rates become flat and roughly independent of t at high @xmath3 .",
    "the dependence on the @xmath120 values is also apparent .",
    "these energies determine the lower integration limit of the ec phase factor in eq .",
    "( [ phiec ] ) and thus , the minimum energy of electrons in the stellar electron plasma to suffer a nuclear capture . at low densities , where this effect is more pronounced , one can roughly distinguish two types of patterns .",
    "those that start with very low rates at low t and increase rapidly with t , such as the rates in @xmath13sc , @xmath14v , @xmath16mn , and @xmath17fe , and those exhibiting a rather flat behavior with much higher rates , as in the cases of @xmath15fe and @xmath16fe .",
    "this global behavior can be understood in terms of the @xmath33 energies .",
    "large negative values , as in the cases of @xmath14v , @xmath16mn , and @xmath17fe , lead to very low rates . @xmath33",
    "energies close to zero as in @xmath13sc lead to intermediate rates , and positive values of @xmath33 cause much higher rates . this general behavior and sensitivity of the rates",
    "to both density and temperature has been observed in different calculations in this mass region from sm @xcite to rpa @xcite calculations .",
    "a comparison of the rates obtained within this formalism and other sm and rpa calculations for even - even _",
    "pf_-shell nuclei can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the next figures , figs .",
    "[ rate_sc45 ] - [ rate_fe57 ] , the relative contributions of the ground and excited states to the total rates are studied .",
    "in addition , total rates and rates obtained from the ground state with full population labeled gs only in the figures , are included .",
    "the latter are always larger than the contribution from the ground state at a finite temperature ( label 0 in the figures ) because of the depopulation of the ground state and both of them converge at zero temperature . as t increases",
    ", one would expect a departure of these two curves ( 0 and gs only ) that would be more apparent when very low - lying excited states are present .",
    "this is the case to a more or less extent in @xmath13sc , @xmath16mn , and @xmath17fe ( see fig .",
    "[ en_exp ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath17fe shows a stronger effect is due to the angular momentum of the ground state . whereas @xmath17fe is a 1/2 state",
    ", @xmath13sc is a 7/2 state , which is more robust against depopulation .",
    "obviously the total contribution ( total in the figures ) is always larger than the contribution from the state 0 , but can be larger or smaller than gs only , depending on how the various states become populated .",
    "the relative importance of the various excited states is determined by their thermal population at a given t , by the phase factor , and by the structure of the gt strength distribution .    in the case of @xmath13sc six excited states",
    "have been considered . at low densities ( @xmath121 mol/@xmath64 )",
    ", the electron chemical potential @xmath62 is relatively small and the electrons can only excite low energy states in the daughter nucleus . in this case",
    "the contribution from the positive parity states labeled 1 , 3 , and 5 , are very small because these states show very little gt strength at low energy in fig .",
    "[ bgt_sc45 ] .",
    "larger rates are found for the states labeled 0 , 2 , and 4 that show some gt strength at very low excitation energies . at higher densities",
    "( @xmath114 mol/@xmath64 ) , @xmath62 is high enough to allow high energetic electrons that excite most of the gt strength distribution . in this case",
    "the contribution of the various excited states to the total rates are basically determined by their thermal population , especially at low temperature .    in the case of @xmath14v in fig .",
    "[ rate_v51 ] two excited states are considered .",
    "the gt strength distributions of the ground and excited states are quite similar and therefore the rates are mainly determined by the thermal population of the states .",
    "we find the contributions to the total rate ordered following the excitation energies of the parent nucleus , especially at high densities .    in fig .",
    "[ rate_fe53 ] for @xmath15fe the three states studied present also very similar gt distributions .",
    "the two excited states appear at a relatively large energy and their thermal population is not significant at these temperatures .",
    "the rates are ordered as a function of the population of the states .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the ground state contribution does not fall at low t , even at low densities , because of the large and positive @xmath33 energies that allow ec at small electron energies .",
    "similar arguments can be applied to the case of @xmath16fe with the difference that in this case the rates are lower than the rates of @xmath15fe mainly because of the smaller @xmath33 values .",
    "small @xmath33 values make the rates sensitive to the structure of the gt at low excitation energy .",
    "this is the reason why the second excited state , exhibiting some strength at low energy , contributes more significantly to the rate .",
    "in the case of @xmath16mn in fig . [ rate_mn55 ]",
    "the negative value of @xmath33 makes the rates small with contributions ordered according to the population .",
    "finally , @xmath17fe in fig .",
    "[ rate_fe57 ] shows a competition between the thermal population and the gt strength distribution of the various states .",
    "the large negative @xmath33 value make the rates very small and quite sensitive to the low - lying gt strength , especially at low densities and temperature .",
    "thus , we observe that the contribution of the states labeled 3 and 4 , which have some gt strength at low energies , are comparatively large in spite of their lower population .",
    "in this work we have evaluated weak - interaction rates , which are basically determined by continuum electron - capture rates , at different density and temperature conditions holding in stellar scenarios .",
    "this study is performed on a set of odd-@xmath1 _ pf_-shell nuclei representative of the constituents in presupernova formations ( i.e. , @xmath13sc , @xmath14v , @xmath15fe , @xmath16fe , @xmath16mn , and @xmath17fe ) . the nuclear structure involved in the calculation of the energy distribution of the gamow - teller strength is described within a selfconsistent deformed hf+bcs+qrpa formalism with density - dependent effective skyrme interactions and spin - isospin residual interactions .",
    "this formalism has been shown to provide a good description of the decay properties of nuclei by comparing gt strength distributions and half - lives with the measured quantities in the laboratory under terrestrial conditions .",
    "certainly , the calculated rates are subject to uncertainties and there is room for improvement in many theoretical aspects . however , the relative importance of the various contributions to the total rates studied in this paper may still be of great interest .",
    "first , gt strength distributions for ground states and excited states below 1 mev excitation energies have been studied in those nuclei and compared with the available data from charge - exchange reactions .",
    "secondly , weak - interaction rates have been calculated for ground and excited states at densities and temperatures holding in astrophysical scenarios of interest , such as silicon burning and presupernova stages .",
    "although ecs are always dominant , positron decays have been also included because some nuclei are unstable @xmath122 and because excited states above @xmath10 values can be thermally populated .",
    "excited states in the parent nucleus beyond 1 mev have not been considered because they are not expected to play any role at the temperatures considered .",
    "the contributions of the excited states to the rates depend on the density and temperature through the population of these states and their phase factors , but depend also on their gt structure . all in all , we find quite similar results for the total rates and for the rates considering only the contribution from the ground states fully populated .",
    "the reason is that population of excited states leads to a depopulation of ground states and both effects are compensated to some extent when the gt strength distributions are not very different from each other .    as a general conclusion",
    ", we can say that the effect on the rates due to the involvement of the excited states of the parent nuclei is of similar order or smaller than the uncertainties inherent to the nuclear structure .",
    "that is , sm versus qrpa calculations , different nuclear interactions , or different treatments in qrpa calculations .",
    "thus , at the densities and temperatures considered , it is relatively safe to use only contributions from ground states , even for odd-@xmath1 nuclei where quasiparticle states appear at low energy .",
