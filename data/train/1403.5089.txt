    "firstly , we note that strategies similar to the ones defined above can be considered for the many - to - one ic as well .",
    "these involve a combination of partial interference cancellation and treating the rest of the interference as noise .",
    "we derive the sum - rate optimality of these strategies under certain channel conditions .",
