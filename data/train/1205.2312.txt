    "the ionization of atoms in an external electric field is , as well - known , one of the oldest subjects in quantum physics . as a simple example of the ionization , hydrogen - like atoms in a uniform electrostatic field",
    "have been extensively considered ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "the background potential caused by the field decreases without limit in one direction , and the electron initially in the bound state will eventually tunnel through the `` barrier '' created by the field , so leading to ionization of the atom . the tunneling rate for an _ ensemble _ of many independent electrons has been calculated based on the exponential decay law following from the statistical assumption that the tunneling rate is proportional to the number of available atoms .    on the other hand , big experimental advances in the field of nano - scale physics have highly enlarged a need for a detailed understanding of the ( time - dependent ) tunneling process of _ individual _ electrons subjected to an external field .",
    "in fact , the nano - scale devices have been designed and fabricated , examples of which are molecular switches @xcite and resonant tunnel junctions @xcite , etc . however , in exploring the time evolution of the electron tunneling process leading to ionization , we have a considerable mathematical difficulty that there are no exactly solvable models for a transition from a bound state to the continuum .",
    "further , even obtaining the numerical solution , with high accuracy , to this problem can not be considered an easy task either , especially in the strong - field limit where a highly oscillatory behavior is found in the time evolution of the bound - continuum transition .",
    "the system under investigation in this paper is a particle subjected to an attractive one - dimensional delta - function potential , @xmath6 .",
    "we intend to study analytically the time evolution of the particle when a uniform electrostatic field @xmath0 is applied .",
    "the delta - function potential well ( not in an external field ) has a single bound state .",
    "this aspect may rather simplify the analytical study of the ionization .",
    "however , no exact solution @xmath2 to the time - dependent schrdinger equation of this problem has been found in closed form ( in terms of the actual calculability to any sufficient degree of precision ) , even for such a simple form of external field .",
    "in fact , this model of the field - induced time - dependent ionization has already been studied by some people .",
    "it was first discussed by geltman @xcite .",
    "later on , several different approaches to obtaining the time - dependent wavefunction @xmath2 have been carried out @xcite .",
    "one of the approaches mainly adopted so far is to turn the relevant time - dependent schrdinger equation into the lippmann - schwinger integral equation [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : lippmann_schwinger_eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : lippmann_schwinger_eq0 ] ) ] .",
    "this integral equation is , however , highly non - trivial to solve analytically and so has been focused mostly upon its numerical solvability . in @xcite by elberfeld and kleber , interestingly enough , the time - dependent ionization probability has been investigated in the strong - field limit based on the numerical analysis of the integral equation .",
    "they also demonstrated numerically that the ionization probability obtained from the simple exponential decay law may be considered a fairly good approximation on the average to the exact result in the strong - field limit although this approximation , by construction , can not account for the short - time ripples , observed in the exact one , which result from the ionization - recombination process in the bound - continuum transition @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper lies in a systematic derivation of the propagator @xmath1 of the system , directly leading to @xmath7 . as our central finding , its essential constituent part @xmath3 , accounting for the ionization - recombination ,",
    "is exactly expressed in terms of the multiple hypergeometric functions @xmath4 , and then in an appropriate approximation scheme in terms of the generalized hypergeometric functions @xmath5 being much more transparent to physically interpret and much more accessible in their numerical evaluation than the functions @xmath4 . the general layout is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] we briefly review the well - known results of both the delta - function potential problem without an external field and the problem of a particle subjected to a uniform electrostatic field but not bound by the ultrathin potential well . in doing so , we also sophisticate the old results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : propagator ] , we derive an explicit expression of the propagator in terms of the multiple hypergeometric functions and then discuss its mathematical complexity . sec .",
