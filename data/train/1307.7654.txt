    "we explored different possibilities for the momentum dependence of the mf by modifying the underlying parameterization for the local particle velocity . at first , we tested different density - dependencies of momentum - dependencies for the mf , by replacing the factor in ( 6 ) linear in @xmath33 by different functions of @xmath33 that reduced to 1 at @xmath34 however , we found the sensitivity of pion yields to that replacement to be too meager to eliminate the discrepancy between the measured and calculated pion yields . on the other hand",
    ", we found that a mere adjustment of the parameter values in ( 6 ) could reduce substantially the discrepancy between the calculated and measured net pion yields , without overly compromising the description of measured baryonic flow by the model .",

    "the long - range coulomb interactions play the primary role in making the @xmath60 ratio dependent on the energy of the emitted pions .",
    "thus , after the pions cease to interact strongly and move out from the reaction region , described then by primordial spectra sharing to a degree characteristics between @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( and @xmath70 ) , the coulomb interactions accelerate @xmath66 and decelerate @xmath67 .",

    "11 and 12 .",
    "contributions to mean - field potentials associated with the symmetry energy principally act opposite to coulomb interactions , but they act there where pions continue to rescatter , in fact with large cross - sections due to the formation of @xmath11-resonance , down to low densities . the scattering tends to erase the impact of different accelerations for @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( and for nucleons and @xmath11 s with different isospin as well ) due to the isospin - dependence of mean fields . with the scattering rates being linear in density",
    ", the mean fields can win over the rescattering , in the low density region , if their dependence on density is slower than linear .",
    "the low - energy part of the spectrum is generally dominated by particles emitted from lower density regions , late in the history of the reactions . in figs .",
    "9 and 10 , we can see that the symmetry energy is indeed effective in countering the effects of coulomb enhancement of the low - energy @xmath71 ratio when @xmath72 and the interaction symmetry energy is large at low densities . at @xmath73 ,",
    "the effect fizzles out .",
    "notably excitation of the medium suppresses the role of pauli principle and of the associated kinetic contribution to the symmetry energy . in fig .",
    "11 , we can see that the impact of the stiffness of symmetry energy , on @xmath74 average - energy difference , weakens past @xmath75 1 .    with regard to the particles emitted at higher c.m .",
    "energies , that tend to stem from early stages of the reaction and higher densities , another high - density effect of the symmetry energy comes into play .",
    "namely , a stiff symmetry energy pushes away the neutron - proton asymmetry from the high - density region [ 25 ] , see fig . 13 . with the reduction in the high - density asymmetry ,",
    "the @xmath60 ratio gets reduced at high c.m .",
    "thus , qualitatively a stiff symmetry energy acts in this energy region as the relative coulomb boost , cf . figs . 9 and 10 . with this",
    ", it becomes possible to access the stiffness of high - density symmetry - energy through the high - energy @xmath60 yield ratio .",
    ", in central au+au collisions at 200a mev , as a function of times . at early times",
    ", the numbers in the ratio are marginal , and the ratio , thus , not very meaningful . ]    in the earlier version of this work [ 28 ] , we also explored the @xmath60 yield ratio in the direction out of the reaction plane as a probe of the symmetry energy at supranormal densities . in that direction",
    "the high - density matter is directly exposed to the vacuum . however , with a higher statistics in the calculations , our claimed directional signal for the symmetry energy has weakened .",
    "with a new parameterization for momentum - dependent mf , pbuu gives a reasonable description of pion multiplicities in moderate - energy central hic .",
    "the puzzling finding is that the same parameterization of the mf momentum - dependence can not be simultaneously used for describing the net pion yields around threshold and the high - momentum elliptic flow of protons .",
    "one potential avenue for resolving this puzzle is in the need for an anisotropy in the mf momentum dependence , when the underlying momentum distribution is anisotropic .",
    "we compared our new momentum dependence of nucleonic optical potential with several microscopic calculations .",
    "the modified potential is within the realm of uncertainties for microscopic predictions , just like the previous potential .",
    "next , we used pion ratio observables to study the symmetry energy behavior at higher density than normal .",
    "while ibuu and imiqmd yield opposing sensitivities to the density dependence of symmetry energy , for @xmath60 net yield ratios , we find no significant sensitivity for that ratio to @xmath5 in pbuu .",
