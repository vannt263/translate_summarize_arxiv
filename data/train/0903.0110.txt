    "in the children s television series _ sesame street _",
    "kermit the frog , a muppet created by jim henson , presented his what - happens - next - machine .",
    "although he proclaimed having constructed it to avoid walking from here to there to turn on his radio , the purpose of the scene , of course , lies in conveying to the spectator the concept of a chain reaction .",
    "more spectacular chain reactions are now often demonstrated in science museums @xcite and tv shows @xcite . the what - happens - next - machine , however , is a - if not _ the _ - historical , famous or notorious example .",
    "the setup is meant to function as follows : a string being cut , a sandbag hung from a pulley drops onto a seesaw . to the other end of the seesaw",
    "a rope is tied which lifts the lid of a box containing a balloon , preferably filled with helium . from the balloon",
    "a string had already been trailing out of the box and is attached to the switch of a radio .",
    "so as the lid opens and the balloon rises , at the point the strings is pulled straight up the radio is turned on .",
    "but , fitting the typical irony of sesame street , even though kermit tries to save whatever possible , nearly every step - except for the balloon floating up ( with some delay ) - is malfunctioning @xcite .",
    "thus , albeit for the good entertainment the flawed performance provides , unfortunately the spectator does not get to see the before described and intended chain reaction . without malfunctions , how fast would it go ?    while it can also be a nice task for students to build and run the machine , this article focusses on calculating the motion . referring to every - day life phenomena or using toys",
    "@xcite can make physics courses and exercises more appealing .",
    "the difficulty often is that one physical concept in its pure form is insufficient to explain the behaviour .",
    "a calculation of the what - happens - next - machine as well has to begin by making appropriate idealizations .",
    "it can , however , provide a challenging exercise for second - year students of physics . in analytical mechanics",
    "textbook examples may fall short of actually conveying the virtue of the langrange formalism , because the posed problems of calculating something s motion can just as well be solved by newtonian concepts , evaluating forces and using energy and momentum conservation . in the setup considered here in the connection of the seesaw to the also rotating lid by the rope",
    "an unexpected complexity is concealed .",
    "finally , numerics will be used making the theoretical problem also a programming exercise .",
    "the setup is drawn in fig.1 and a close - up with labels is given in fig.2 .",
    "we need :    ll + @xmath0 : & constant of gravitation , @xmath1 + @xmath2 : & mass of the sandbag ( considered a point mass ) + @xmath3 : & length of the right half of the seesaw + @xmath4 : & length of the rope ( straightened ) + @xmath5 : & half edge of the box , and thus also of the lid ( assumed square ) + @xmath6 : & mass of the box s lid + @xmath7 : & moment of inertia of the box s lid with respect to its hinge ; @xmath8 + @xmath9 : & radius of the balloon ( assumed a sphere ) ; we set @xmath10 + @xmath11 : & density of air , 1.29 kg m@xmath12",

    "the kinetic energy of the sandbag can be rewritten as @xmath21 if the sandbag and the seesaw are moving together .",
    "the potential energy of the balloon accounts for buoyancy .",
    "the seesaw is regarded as massless ( that is negligible mass as compared to the sandbag ) .",
    "the box is fixed to the ground , only the lid moves .",
    "the rope is assumed massless and the mass of the balloon s rubber skin is neglected , too @xcite .",
    "there is no friction in the hinges of the seesaw and the lid and as well no sliding friction is considered should the sandbag slide down the seesaw .",
    "the lagrangian @xcite ( for the sandbag in contact with the seesaw ) is therefore put up as : @xmath22 in the following we shall , however , consider @xmath23 without the balloon s contributions . to neglect the pressure the balloon due",
    "to buoyancy exerts from below onto the lid , seems a realistic assumption .",
    "the balloon will therefore only follow the motion of the lid if it can rise fast enough .",
    "we further assume that the balloon does not bounce off downwards when it hits the lid , but that its motion is completely damped out in this case .",
    "letting aside the balloon , following the lagrange formalism we deduce : @xmath24 @xmath25 is time .",
    "@xmath16 is an independent variable , whence we get @xmath26 as a first differential equation or equation of motion . with the rope straight ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are not independent .",
    "we choose to take @xmath18 as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the geometric relation is given in an attachment .",
    "then @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the derivatives @xmath30 and @xmath31 are evaluated numerically in an actual calculation .",
    "thus a second equation of motion follows from ( 2 ) : @xmath32 the functionality @xmath33 is a constraint in the sense of the lagrange formalism .",
    "it takes the form of an equality if the rope is straight .",
    "a non - holonomous constraint , nevertheless , is also always present if the rope is loose , namely that the right endpoint of the seesaw and the right edge of the lid can not be more than a distance of @xmath4 apart .",
    "even if here we do not handle the balloon as part of one complete lagrangian , there is an also non - holonomous constraint on its motion .",
    "it can not exceed a certain height determined by the lid , whereas it may well stay below that limit .",
    "geometric considerations concerning this point are given in an attachment .",
    "furthermore , not including the balloon pressing against the lid from underneath into the equations of motion , care must be taken not to let the lid drop below its initial position on top of the balloon .",
    "the integration of ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is performed numerically , in the most simple manner in the attached program .",
    "more advanced methods like , for example , the runge - kutta scheme , could of course be employed .",
    "calculating the free fall of the sandbag as well as the time and position of its hitting the seesaw is trivial . at the beginning",
    "the seesaw can be at rest at any angle the length of the rope allows . as long as or if the rope is not straight our massless seesaw will just give way to the free falling sandbag .",
    "however , the instant the rope straightens or is already straight when the sandbag hits the seesaw , because of suddenly the weight of the lid pulling there will be a discontinuity in the velocities , which must be determined apart from equations of motion like ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "this turned out to be the most difficult , and to my opinion still somewhat ambiguous aspect of the problem . for reasons",
    "explained later the more general case is investigated that the lid can already be moving when the rope straightens or the sandbag hits the seesaw .",
    "furthermore can the sandbag also have a horizontal velocity in its free fall .",
    "as there is nothing to stop it , the velocity of the sandbag along the seesaw @xmath34 is conserved and assigned to @xmath35 at impact . @xmath36 but what about the initial angular velocity of the seesaw immediately after impact",
    "? we shall assume an inelastic collision insofar as the sandbag never bounces off upwards from the seesaw .",
    "immediately after impact the seesaw and the sandbag move together ( later it is checked whether the vertical velocity from the turning and centrifugal motion would exceed free fall and eventually the sandbag is allowed to loose touch with the seesaw ) .",
    "both kinetic energy and angular momentum can not be conserved in the collision .",
    "drawing the analogy to the one - dimensional inelastic collision where the two bodies stick together afterwards , momentum is conserved , but part of the kinetic energy goes into deformation and heat , the logical decision in our case is to require conservation of angular momentum . however , as the sandbag on the seesaw and the lid do not turn around the same center , the definition of angular momentum is not necessarily clear here .",
    "it further only imports at the singular moment of impact .",
    "( the motion afterwards of all parts together as calculated from the lagrangian obeys energy conservation . )    our treatment of the impact is therefore based on the following very elementary considerations : does _ not _ produce spurious results ( @xmath16 and @xmath37 before the collision just describe the sandbag at the end of its free fall in polar coordinates , @xmath38 before is known , afterwards @xmath39 , thus only @xmath37 needs to be determined ) . neither does conserving kinetic energy of rotational motion @xmath40 produce any qualitatively or obviously impossible behaviour ( with in general the rope at oblique angles to the seesaw and the lid",
    ", forces perpendicular to one can well be along the other , and thus conservation of the sum of angular momenta of each around their hinge need not necessarily be expected , which would leave energy as a quantity eventually to be conserved ) . attempting to evaluate velocities after the collision by normal momentum conservation together with the constraint that afterwards the sandbag on the seesaw and the lid at least momentarily move together does lead to contradictions , even if the angles @xmath41 and @xmath42 do not show them .",
    "there is more kinetic energy after the collision than before . and",
    "this does produce cases where the sandbag bounces off the seesaw with an upward velocity component . ]",
    "the instant the sandbag hits and/or the rope straightens , the pulling lid acts like a hypothetical mass on the seesaw at distance @xmath3 from the center",
    ". the angular momentum the lid has with respect to its hinge can instead be taken as that of one third of the mass sitting at its end .",
    "therefore decompose @xmath43 into a lever arm @xmath44 and momentum perpendicular to it @xmath45 .",
    "however , now in order to find the part having an effect at the other end of the rope tied to the seesaw , the momentum has to viewed as made up of two in general non - perpendicular components along the lid and along the rope , the latter being @xmath46 .",
    "how to evaluate the angle @xmath47 is also given in an attachment . at the seesaw this momentum translated along the rope with lever arm @xmath3 makes up an angular momentum @xmath48 ( fig.5 ) . after the collision",
    "the change of @xmath18 is determined by that of @xmath17 , nevertheless , the  transfer coefficient  for angular momentum through the rope remains the factor @xmath49 .",
    "with @xmath50 the velocity of the sandbag perpendicular to the seesaw before , to solve for @xmath37 immediately after impact we have the following equation : @xmath51 the first time the sandbag hits when it comes from vertical free fall and the lid is still at rest , we have @xmath52 and @xmath53 at impact . of course",
    ", the argument could have been led the other way round , first replacing @xmath2 at @xmath16 by some mass turning at @xmath3 on the seesaw , translating a momentum component down the rope to the lid and establishing conservation of angular momentum around the hinge of the lid .",
    "the results for @xmath37 and @xmath38 after the collision would have been the same .",
    "in this section it shall be sought whether the equation of motion could have been deduced by more elementary means than the lagrange formalism . with the sandbag on the seesaw the sum of kinetic and potential energies",
    "is @xmath54 requiring energy conservation leads to : @xmath55 where the term @xmath56 has been split into a negative and twice the positive contribution . now using the knowledge that the radial motion of the sandbag will follow the respective component of the gravitational force and the centrifugal force , futher demand that the first three terms in ( 8) and the rest be zero each on its own . dividing by @xmath57 or @xmath37 , respectively , and expressing @xmath58 and @xmath59 by derivatives and @xmath37 and @xmath60 as before for the motion with the rope straight , this will reproduce ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "however , as likely if not more likely than by putting up energy conservation , one would approach a mechanics problem with levers and ropes by looking at forces and torques .",
    "the following considerations are still restricted to the motion when the sandbag is in touch with the seesaw and the rope is straight . as explained earlier ,",
    "the first equation of motion ( 3 ) for @xmath61 is rather obviously written down .",
    "the torques determining the angular accelerations @xmath60 and @xmath59 are more difficult to find .",
    "the time derivative of the sandbag s angular momentum @xmath62 is @xmath63 . like in the last section",
    "the change in angular momentum of the lid is taken into account as seen at the other end of the rope .",
    "therefore with respect to the seesaw s center this is @xmath64 .",
    "the component of the gravitational force on the sandbag which leads to angular acceleration is @xmath65 . for the torque",
    "@xmath6 s gravitation exerts on the lid replace the the lid by half the mass @xmath66 at the end of an otherwise massless lid . as force component perpendicular to the lid there",
    "you have @xmath67 ; multiply by @xmath44 to get the torque .",
    "this torque translates into an effective one @xmath68 at the other end of the rope up at the seesaw , which is , of course , opposed to the sandbag s .",
    "the seesaw and the lid are literally tied together and therefore the available torques together have to provide the changes in angular momentum taken together : @xmath69 we checked numerically that @xmath70 . and when again @xmath71 is implied , ( 9 ) becomes identical to ( 4 ) .",
    "setting up the equation of motion for @xmath60 from forces and torques one is likely to forget the term @xmath72 , which looks like a coriolis force @xcite , because ( 3 ) already seems to cover effects associated to the radial motion . instead of projecting the lid s change in angular momentum into an acceleration of rotational motion of the seesaw , one could decompose forces that lead to the respective torques at the right end of the seesaw and at the end of the lid into parts along the seesaw or lid and along the rope and say that the tearing force on the rope is equal in both directions ( fig.6 ) .",
    "the acceleration forces are against the sense of the angles , but an equivalent force on the right side of the seesaw to the weight of the sandbag on the left has to point upwards .",
    "further @xmath73 is for changing the lever arm of the sandbag from @xmath16 to @xmath3 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the already known geometrical factors from the parallelograms of forces ( or momenta ) to get parts along the rope .",
    "@xmath76 ( 10 ) is the same as ( 9 ) .",
    "one further difficulty , which shall be called the  connecting - rod problem  , has so far been overlooked . of course",
    ", this will depend on the parameters , that is weights , lengths and initial angles . with the weight of the lid pulling down , one naturally expects the angular motion to slow down , that is @xmath60 and @xmath59 become negative . the direction of @xmath77 in fig.6 because of the second contribution besides the one with @xmath60 in it , @xmath72 , will not necessarily be reversed .",
    "furthermore , with directions of forces at the end of the seesaw as in fig.6 there is no reason why we should not have @xmath78 . then fig.6 and ( 10 )",
    "imply that @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "( we shall not allow somersaults , that is we only regard @xmath81 and @xmath82 . at @xmath83",
    "the sandbag would drop from the seesaw anyway . and",
    "the lid of the box is assumed to engage when it reaches the vertical position .",
    "the projection factors @xmath75 and @xmath74 are always positive ; the rope can not come below the lid or above the right side of the seesaw . )",
    "a constellation with @xmath84 would mean that , instead of tearing , forces would be pushing into the rope from both ends .",
    "if then we solved ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) assuming the distance between the right end of the seesaw and the end of the lid constant , namely the length @xmath4 , we would take the rope for a connecting rod and say that the lid having aquired enough angular momentum could then push against the seesaw from below via the  rope  . in this case ,",
    "in fact , the rope will loosen .",
    "the motion of the lid and the sandbag has to be separated , each merely further accelerated by the corresponding gravitational force ( our massless seesaw giving way to the sandbag ) , until again the rope possibly straightens .",
    "this is why the general case of a horizontal velocity of the sandbag and the lid already moving had been treated at impact .",
    "the flow - diagram for integrating the equations of motion step by step in time in a numerical simulation is given in fig.7 .",
    "four examples of calculations shall now be given .",
    "for each , parameters and starting values as defined in section 2 are given .",
    "@xmath85 is the time step for the calculation .",
    "the balloon is in contact with the lid of the box at the beginning .",
    "parameters : @xmath2 = 0.6 kg , @xmath3 = 0.6 m , @xmath4 = 1.0 m , @xmath5 = 0.2 m , @xmath6 = 0.5 kg , @xmath86 = 0.73 m , @xmath87 = 0.33 m , @xmath85 = 0.001 s. starting values : @xmath14 = -0.3 m , @xmath15 = 1.0 m , @xmath17 = -25@xmath88 , @xmath18 = 5@xmath88 .",
    "besides the horizontal and the vertical position of the sandbag in time , we have also plotted its trajectory in space .",
    "seesaw and lid angles over time are united in one plot .",
    "the balloon s height as a function of time is drawn together with the height limit imposed by the lid .",
    "@xmath25=0 , of course , is the time the sandbag starts falling . at @xmath25=0.42s",
    "it hits the seesaw .",
    "however , the rope is not straight yet , thus the seesaw just gives way to the falling sandbag .",
    "it already turns , such that at @xmath25=0.51s when the rope straigtens and the lid begins to be pulled up , the seesaw  starting  angle has changed from the initially given value .",
    "however , here , immediately after the lid is pulled up for the first time , the _ connection - rod check _ returns _ true _ , the rope loosens never to become straight again in this example . the most complicated differential equation ( 4 )",
    "is only needed for a single time - step in this calculation !",
    "the one impact has given the lid enough angular momentum .",
    "it reaches the vertical position ( @xmath18=@xmath89 ) at @xmath25=0.82s .",
    "first example .",
    "note that by this time the sandbag is on the seesaw s left arm 2 meters ( @xmath90 ) from the center .",
    "our program does not contain a check for the sandbag to reach the end of the seesaw ( which could be added without problems , nevertheless ) . in this example at later times the lid moves independently , and the sandbag dropping from the seesaw would not change that . the lid opens faster than the balloon can rise . only shortly before the box has fully opened does the balloon touch the lid once again . with the lid in vertical position ,",
    "the balloon can then rise freely .",
    "the time it takes to turn on the radio depends on the length of the balloon string and has not been calculated any more .",
    "remark that the interesting part of the motion from the rope s first straightening until the lid s reaching vertical position only lasts from @xmath25=0.51s to @xmath25=0.82s , that is 0.31 seconds .    as a second example",
    "a case has been sought where the rope stays straight at least for some time while pulling up the lid .",
    "parameters and starting values are the same as in the first example except @xmath4 = 0.62 m , @xmath15 = 0.5 m and @xmath17 = -35@xmath88 .",
    "the sandbag meets the seesaw at @xmath25=0.24s , the lid starts moving at @xmath25=0.33s and reaches the vertical position at @xmath25=0.54s , that is already 0.21s later .",
    "the balloon can not catch up with the lid during that time . at the end",
    "the sandbag is 0.6 m from the center on the left arm of the seesaw , which is equal to the length of the right arm in this case . from @xmath25=0.49s on the sandbag can not follow the seesaw any more and looses touch for more than one time intervall ( the rope loosens ) .",
    "we only show the two angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 as functions of time , however , also compare them to the results that would have been obtained had the impact been calculated following conservation of the sum of angular momenta , energy or linear momenta ( see section 3 ) . these would be that the lid reaches the vertical position at @xmath25=0.50s , @xmath25=0.47s or @xmath25=0.34s , respectively .",
    "the last one definitely has to be disregarded as unphysical , though ( see section 3 ) .",
    "second example .    parameters and starting values are the same as in the first example , except @xmath85 = 0.00025 s and at the beginning @xmath15 = 0.0 m , @xmath17 = 0@xmath88 , that is the seesaw is horizontal and the sandbag is just placed on it , not let drop from a height .",
    "third example .",
    "this example has been chosen , because the lid opens so slowly that the balloon catches up with it several times until practically staying trapped touching the lid .",
    "unfortunately , the chain reaction will not come to freeing the ballon and switching on the radio in this case .",
    "the seesaw will reach its vertical position at @xmath25=20s .",
    "however , there we assumed that the sandbag can slide an endless way on it , @xmath16 will be 1949 m !",
    "the lid will be at @xmath18=74@xmath88 . at @xmath17=@xmath91/2",
    "the sandbag finally dropping from the seesaw and the rope loosening , even if one persued this situation which has grown out of proportions , one constitutes that the lid does not have sufficient angular velocity to continue up to vertical position , but will quickly drop back down .",
    "parameters : @xmath2 = 0.7 kg , @xmath3 = 0.45 m , @xmath4 = 0.9 m , @xmath5 = 0.2 m , @xmath6 = 0.4 kg , @xmath86 = 0.64 m , @xmath87 = 0.29 m , @xmath85 = 0.001 s. starting values : @xmath14 = -0.3 m , @xmath15 = 0.5 m , @xmath17 = -20@xmath88 , @xmath18 = 5@xmath88 .",
    "the balloon catches up with the lid at @xmath25=0.64s , to be pressed down by it again and then follow it up again staying  glued  underneath it .",
    "in conclusion kermit s what - happens - next - machine has been treated as an analytical mechanics and programming exercise .",
    "the two lever arms of the seesaw and the box s lid tied together by the rope can serve as a quite challenging example for finding the equation of motion using the lagrange formalism . the most difficult point",
    ", however , is the decision which quantities are conserved and which are not at impact when the first force on the rope appears .",
    "a simulation has been set up and examples with different behaviour have been shown .",
    "it has been found that in cases where the counterweight of the falling sandbag is able to fully open the box to free the balloon , the interesting phase of the procedure only lasts some tenths of a second ( this can not be known from the original scene from sesame street , because there the machine does not work properly ) .",
    "some simplifications have been made to be able to solve the problem theoretically ( for example : no friction , neglection of the seesaw s mass ) . at the stage of development , including a mass for the seesaw would mean merely a small extension for who wants to refine the simulation .",
    "attention has to be paid to the case that the seesaw then contributes inertia even if the sandbag is not in touch with it .",
    "as has been appreciated by some of our students , in the context of teaching theoretical mechanics , the what - happens - next - machine can be given as an amusing tricky problem .",
    "thanks to elke scheer and wolfgang belzig , who held the second year s physics lecture to which the what - happens - next - machine was put as a supplementary exercise in the form of a competition .",
