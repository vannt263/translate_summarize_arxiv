    "bright arc - like structures extending from the sun , when seen in extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) wavelengths , are called coronal loops . being a characteristic feature of the corona",
    ", it is important to assimilate high - resolution information on these structures in order to understand how plasma in the outer atmosphere is heated to multi - million kelvin temperatures .",
    "the plasma temperatures and pressures are known to vary along the lengths of the loops , whose gradients provide some insight on the underlying heating mechanisms @xcite , but the main attribute of critical importance is the cross - field morphology @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that coronal loops consist of multiple unresolved thin strands @xcite .",
    "observational evidence demonstrating low filling factors , different degrees of ` fuzziness ' observed in loops at different temperatures @xcite , and plasma dynamics at small spatial scales @xcite indicate that this scenario is likely to be true .",
    "the typical cross - sections of the strands were estimated to be a few tens to a few hundreds of kilometres @xcite .",
    "possible braiding of these strands can instigate magnetic reconnection , thus releasing significant energy to directly heat the plasma inside the loop @xcite .",
    "each strand is believed to be impulsively and independently heated , leading to a multi - thermal configuration across the loop @xcite . however , not all studies are consistent with this scenario since some loops demonstrate isothermal structuring .",
    "one of the main issues plaguing observations of coronal loops is the intrinsic optically thin emission .",
    "since the observed intensities are integrated along the line - of - sight , it becomes difficult to exclude emission from overlapping structures , which can be formed at different temperatures and inadvertently imply a multi - thermal structure . in this letter",
    ", we use a unique set of observations to reveal the multi - stranded and multi - thermal nature of a coronal loop , and isolate two of its components through the application of mhd seismology .",
    "more importantly , our results are free from the adverse effects arising from line - of - sight integrations .",
    "the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) captures full - disk images of the sun at high spatial resolution ( @xmath0870 km ) nearly simultaneously in 10 different wavelength channels in the visible - euv range of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "images of a nearly circular sunspot , part of active region noaa 11366 acquired by aia on 10 december 2011 through two of its euv channels centred at 171  and 131 , constitute the data used in this study .",
    "the time sequence starting from 15:30 ut until 18:00 ut is considered which comprises 750 images per channel at a cadence of 12  s. all of the data were prepared following standard procedures .",
    "images in each channel were co - aligned to the first image using intensity cross - correlation .",
    "the peak temperature sensitivities of the 171  and 131  channels are at 0.7 mk and 0.4 mk , respectively .",
    "note that the 131  channel is also able to observe high - temperature ( @xmath010 mk ) components , such as those found in flaring plasma @xcite .",
    "however , the high - temperature components can be safely neglected for the present region due to the non - flaring environment .",
    "the location of the selected sunspot and a subfield enclosing it are shown in fig .",
    "the 171  and 131  images of this region show coronal loops extending from within the spot umbra to about 20  30 mm away in almost all directions , forming an extended fan - like structure ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1]b-[fig1]e ) .",
    "the images , when observed as time - lapse movies , display propagating features along these loops .",
    "fourier analysis on lightcurves along the propagation path reveal narrow peaks around 6  mhz illustrating the prevalence of @xmath03  min oscillations in the data . to enhance the visibility of propagating features",
    ", we employed fourier filtration of the time series at each spatial position to retain only oscillations manifesting within a narrow window between 2 and 4 min .",
    "the filtered image sequences along with some sample ( unfiltered ) fourier power spectra along the propagation path are available online .",
    "these sequences clearly show alternate bright and dark fronts moving outwards , which are indicative of propagating compressive waves .",
    "a debate is in progress on the possible ambiguity caused by the high - speed quasi - periodic upflows @xcite , which show similar signatures .",
    "however , the sunspot oscillations observed here , with wave fronts propagating symmetrically in all directions , unequivocally represent slow magneto - acoustic waves .",
    "it may be noted that these waves are also observed in other coronal channels ( for e.g. , aia 193 ) .",
    "however , smaller amplitudes , contributions from lower temperature lines to the 193  passband , which could be as high as 30  40% of the total emission @xcite , make them unsuitable for the present study .      to study the observed waves in detail",
    ", we tracked their path along one of the loops ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and constructed time - distance maps for both temperature channels .",
    "again , the time series at each spatial location is fourier filtered to retain only oscillations between 2 and 4 min . the final maps , following fourier filtration , are shown in fig .  [ fig1]f , which display alternating bright and dark ridges representing outwardly propagating slow waves .",
    "in these maps , the footpoints along the track are joined together in the middle , with distances along each path increasing vertically outwards from the center , hence displaying a typical ` fishbone ' pattern .",
    "the ridges embedded within each channel commence simultaneously , indicating that the loop structures observed at these two temperatures are one and the same .",
    "the inclinations of the ridges provide a measure of the propagation speeds . as can be seen , the ridges in both channels display non - constant inclinations , suggesting acceleration and the subsequent increases in their propagation speeds . to further quantify this , we measure time lags at each spatial position using a cross - correlation technique @xcite .",
    "we restrict this estimation to the region bounded by the dash - dotted lines displayed in fig .",
    "the lines in the center mark the locations of the loop footpoint ( figs .",
    "[ fig1]d , [ fig1]e ) , while the outer lines mark the distances up to which the signal was deemed reliable .",
    "the measured time lags and the associated errors are plotted in fig .",
    "solid lines represent a second - order polynomial fit to the data .",
    "an inverse derivative of the fitted values was then used to estimate the propagation speeds that are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , alongside the respective errors .",
    "these values clearly show acceleration in both 171  and 131  channels .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] displays the @xmath1-@xmath2 diagrams for the aia 171  and 131  channels corresponding to the outward propagating waves , as described in @xcite .",
    "these diagrams are generated from the initial ( unfiltered ) time - distance maps .",
    "higher oscillatory power is clearly evident along a ridge , indicating a linear relation between the frequency , @xmath2 , and the wavenumber , @xmath1 .",
    "this behavior further confirms that the observed waves follow the dispersion relation for slow magneto - acoustic waves , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the propagation speed",
    ". the white dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig3]a & [ fig3]b corresponds to a speed of 55 and 40  kms@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "one may note that the ridges in the k - omega diagrams are rather wide in the vertical direction .",
    "this is a consequence of the spread in the observed propagation speeds due to acceleration .",
    "hence the white dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] only provide an indication of the range of phase speeds present in the data .",
    "the plasma @xmath6 ( ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure ) in the solar corona is usually very low ( @xmath71 ) , which guides the slow magneto - acoustic waves to propagate at the local sound speed .",
    "however , the measured propagation speeds are normally along projections of the loop onto a 2-d image plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "thus , the observed speed , @xmath8 , is related to the sound speed , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the polytropic index , t is the plasma temperature , r(=8.314@xmath12 ergk@xmath5mol@xmath5 ) is the gas constant , @xmath13(=0.61 ) is the mean molecular weight ( mean mass per particle ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath14 is the angle of inclination of the loop with respect to the line - of - sight . the observed speed is essentially a function of the plasma temperature and the inclination angle of the loop . note that , in principle , any variations in the polytropic index @xmath11 , and some non - linear effects could as well influence the observed propagation speed .",
    "however , the contribution of these effects is likely to minimal in the present case since the observed speeds change smoothly over distance and the wave amplitudes appear to be within linear regime .",
    "we use vector magnetograms of the photosphere , obtained by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and employ nonlinear force - free field extrapolations @xcite to estimate inclination angles at different positions along the loop .",
    "such extrapolations have proven to be robust in previous studies of this active region @xcite .",
    "the obtained inclination angles , with respect to the line - of - sight , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a as a function of height above the photosphere .",
    "the estimations were made at the loop footpoint marked by a cross in figs .",
    "[ fig1]d & [ fig1]e . considering the footpoint to be about 2 mm above the photosphere , and taking the changing inclination angle into account , the height range between the vertical dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a was identified to correspond to the loop segment over which the propagation speeds are measured . using the obtained inclination angles , we deproject the measured phase speeds and estimate the corresponding local plasma temperatures following equation  [ eq1 ] .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4]b & [ fig4]c , where the respective errors propagated from the measured phase speeds are also displayed . note that the x - axes in these plots show actual distances along the loop from the footpoint , rather than the projected distance used in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . due to high thermal conduction in the solar corona @xcite , and the short oscillation period ( 180 s )",
    ", it may be appropriate to assume an isothermal propagation of the wave @xcite under a linear approximation .",
    "however , the actual propagation could be isothermal or adiabatic , or somewhere in between , depending on the local conditions . as a result",
    ", we use @xmath11=1 in these calculations , but also show the corresponding adiabatic solutions ( for @xmath11=5/3 ) as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4]c .",
    "clearly , the temperature in both channels increases with distance along the loop .",
    "furthermore , there is an appreciable difference in the temperature between the two channels at all spatial locations along the loop .",
    "since the loop structure visible in both channels is congruent , these results imply a multi - thermal ( and consequently multi - stranded ) structure of the loop .",
    "importantly , the obtained temperature profiles highlight two distinct components of its multi - thermal cross section .",
    "we would like to note that the obtained temperatures near the loop footpoints are shifted from the peaks , but still within the temperature response functions of their respective aia channels .",
    "however , the footpoints are still observable with reasonable ( albeit significantly lower ) intensities .",
    "excess emission ( i.e. , above what would be expected from the contributions related to the loop footpoint temperatures ) found in these locations may be a consequence of the inevitable optically - thin integration of background / foreground emission , whose contribution may be higher near the footpoints .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that our derivation of the multi - thermal temperature profiles is independent of any such contamination ( since the phase speeds are independent of the background loop intensity ) , highlights the diagnostic power of our technique .",
    "slow magnetoacoustic waves are known to damp as they propagate in the solar corona . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1]f , the waves can no longer be detected after a certain distance along the loop . to study this behavior and",
    "estimate the characteristic damping length , we analyze the spatial variation of intensity along the loop due to the wave .",
    "the intensities ( background subtracted ) from a particular instant in time as marked by red arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig1]f , occurring between the horizontal dashed lines is subsequently plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for both channels .",
    "note that the distances shown in this figure correspond to the actual ( i.e. , non - projected ) values along the loop from the footpoint .",
    "the errors on the intensities have been estimated from noise contained within the data from each of the respective channels .",
    "the red curves overplotted on the data represent the best fitting @xcite damped sinusoid , as defined by the function @xmath15here , @xmath16 is the distance along the loop , @xmath17 is the damping length , @xmath18 is the wavelength , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the initial amplitude and phase , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are appropriate constants . since the phase speed of the observed wave is changing with distance as it propagates along the loop , its wavelength , @xmath18 , also varies as a function of distance .",
    "we estimate @xmath23 from the derived phase speeds and the oscillation period ( 180 s ) for best - fitting the data .",
    "the obtained best - fit parameters are listed in the plot .",
    "the damping lengths are 3.3@xmath240.9 mm and 3.7@xmath243.1 mm for the 171  and 131  channels , respectively .",
    "the relatively short damping length in the hotter 171  channel is compatible with the theory of damping due to thermal conduction .",
    "however , this trend is not consistent at all temporal locations and the larger errors associated with the weaker 131  channel make it difficult to indisputably conclude . nevertheless , the positive damping lengths ( i.e. , a reduction in amplitude ) obtained in both channels are consistent with the presence of positive temperature gradients observed along the loop @xcite . using the temperature gradients , the response functions of the aia 171  and 131  channels , and the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "we conclude that the observed damping is due primarily to wave dissipation and not an observational effect associated with temperature and density stratification @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the remarkable correspondence between the derived wavelength profiles , @xmath23 , and the observed intensities ( as visible from the quality of the fit ) , emphasizes the credibility of the derived phase speeds .",
    "note that the increasing phase speed would also result in a reduction in the wave amplitude as a function of distance , which should also be considered while inferring any dissipation mechanisms from the observed amplitudes .",
    "in addition , it may not always be approrpriate to assume an exponential decay in wave amplitude since it is affected by variations in background physical conditions ( e.g. , local sound speeed ) that are not necessarily exponential .",
    "we present here the first ever unambiguous observations of multiple accelerating slow magnetoacoustic waves along a coronal loop .",
    "evidence for small speed increases has been noted before , but was generally attributed to projection effects associated with a variable inclination of the structure rather than a true acceleration .",
    "however , in the present case , the change in speed is substantial even after accounting for the projection effects .",
    "the distinct speeds observed in the two channels indicate the multi - stranded and multi - thermal nature of the loop .",
    "the positive temperature gradients derived from the propagation speeds are consistent with the positive damping lengths obtained and are suggestive of more uniform heating along the loop @xcite . moreover ,",
    "these results are free from any possible contamination from overlapping structures in the line - of - sight and thus demonstrate the potential of mhd waves in revealing the basic physical properties of coronal loops .",
