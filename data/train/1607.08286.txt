    "collections of self - propelled agents like fish , birds , bacteria , microtubules , or even non - biological objects as active colloids , present the remarkable property that they can gather together in clusters .",
    "the phenomenology of clustering is large , with important differences between , for example , fish and bird , where inertia and social behavior are important and microscopic organisms ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in the case of microorganisms swimming at low reynolds numbers ,",
    "hydrodynamic interactions emerge , which can explain in part their clustering ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , for a description of the hydrodynamics of microorganisms ) .",
    "however , in many cases there is no evident attraction between individuals but nevertheless clustering takes place .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed to explain and quantify this phenomenon .",
    "one paradigm is that mutual alignment of the self - propelled individuals , along the line of the viscek model and others , results in swarming clusters  @xcite .",
    "also , motility - induced phase separation ( mips ) has been proposed as a driving mechanism @xcite : the mutual interactions gives rise to an effective reduction of the motility when the local density increases , resulting in a positive feedback for clustering .",
    "finally , it has been shown that the combination of excluded volume and persistence in the direction of motion leads also to the formation of clusters @xcite .",
    "indeed , if particles persist in their direction and encounter others that can not overlap , they will remain blocked until they change direction , for example , by tumbling or rotational diffusion .",
    "this can be understood as an extreme case of mips where motility is reduced to zero by exclusion .",
    "the case when clustering appears by the combination of excluded volume and persistence has been studied using off - lattice models , with agents that change direction continuously by the effect of rotational diffusion @xcite .",
    "normally , to avoid effects due to alignments , spherical agents are considered .",
    "also , lattice models have been proposed where cells move in prescribed directions , which change randomly at tumble events @xcite .",
    "both in the lattice and off - lattice models , in absence of other attractive interaction , it has been observed that clusters can appear ( see the recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "two cases are observed ; the steady state consists of many small clusters , which evaporate and merge and actively exchange particles among them or coarsening takes place and few large clusters remain in the steady state .",
    "ultimately , these clusters will merge into a single one on large time scales . using as order parameter",
    "the fraction of particles in the largest cluster , a clustering to coarsening transition has been identified in terms of the activity for an active colloidal suspension @xcite . in a similar system",
    ", a phase diagram has been constructed in terms of density and activity , finding gas , clustering and percolating phases @xcite .",
    "the authors however , indicate that going from gas to cluster there is no real phase transition but , rather a crossover takes place , and no distinction is made between clustering and coarsening . in similar system and control parameters , a phase diagram is presented in refs .",
    "@xcite where coarsening and gas phases are present .",
    "the objective of the present work is to study systematically the phase diagram for self - propelled particles that interact with excluded volume , in order to determine whether the gaseous , clustering and coarsening phases are well defined and , in this case , characterize the transitions between them . for that purpose",
    ", we adopt a lattice model , which is the simplest that includes persistence and excluded volume and no residual interactions can appear .",
    "previous studies show that in the lattice model , clusters form at low tumbling rates , although with important differences depending if the excluded volume is strictly enforced with maximum one particle per site @xcite or if many particles per site are allowed @xcite . in the first case , clusters form with an exponential size distribution , but not coarsening takes place , while in the second case",
    ", coarsening happens and the final state consists of few large clusters .",
    "this difference in behavior has its origin only on the maximum number of particles per site , that has been explored to be either 1 or very large , and no intermediate values has been studied . in this manuscript",
    "we explore how this parameter affects coarsening and the character of the associated transition .",
    "the pair distribution for the case with maximum one particle per site has been found exactly and it has been shown that clusters appear but no coarsening or phase transitions take place @xcite in agreement with numerical results @xcite .",
    "our observations show that indeed three distinct phases exist : gaseous , clustering and coarsening . to characterize the transitions the model is extended to allow for the maximum number or particles per site to be a real number and jumps to a partially occupied site are probabilistic .",
    "it is shown then that authentic non - equilibrium transitions between phases takes place , that change from continuous to discontinuous at a critical point .",
    "we consider a periodic lattice in one dimension , consisting of @xmath5 sites , where @xmath6 particles move , with time evolving in discrete time steps .",
    "each particle has a state variable @xmath7 that indicates the direction to which it points . at each time step particles attempt to jump one site in the direction pointed by @xmath8 and excluded",
    "volume effects takes place in the following way : if there are less than @xmath1 particles in the destination site , the jump is performed , otherwise the particle stays in the original position . to model tumble events , the directions @xmath8",
    "are changed to new random directions with a rate @xmath0 .",
    "this model is an extension of the persistent exclusion process ( pep ) presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case where multiple occupation per site is allowed .",
    "more explicitly , this model reproduces the pep when @xmath2 .",
    "the position update of the particles is asynchronous to avoid two particles attempting to jump to the same site simultaneously .",
    "that is , at each time step , the @xmath6 particles are sorted randomly and , sequentially , each particle jumps to the site pointed by @xmath8 if the occupation in the destination site is lower than @xmath1 .",
    "finally , at the end of the update phase , tumbles are performed : for each particle , with probability @xmath0 , the director @xmath8 is redrawn at random , independently of the original value . in analogy to hard - core systems , particles only interact via excluded volume effects and there are no energetic penalizations , partial motility reduction as in mips , or explicit alignment as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the control parameters are the particle density @xmath9 , the tumble rate @xmath0 and the maximum occupation number @xmath1 .",
    "time is measured in time steps and lengths in lattice sizes , therefore particles have velocities @xmath10 .",
    "an important order parameter of the system is the fraction of jammed particles @xmath11 , namely those that could not jump , which equals one minus the average squared velocity . if all particles participate in a single cluster , its size would be @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the fraction of the system occupied by the cluster . here , @xmath14 measures the faction of the maximum occupation in the system .",
    "the model has the intrinsic time scale corresponding to the time it takes a particle to cross one site @xmath15 and also the mean flight time , which depends on density .",
    "tumbling is characterized by the time scale @xmath16 , which must be compared with the previous two , rendering the phase diagram highly non trivial .",
    "three initial conditions are used .",
    "first , particles are placed randomly , respecting the excluded volume restriction , with random orientations to study how clusters are formed from a gas phase . secondly , to analyze the stability of clusters ,",
    "particles are placed forming a saturated cluster , with @xmath1 particles per site , where @xmath17 sites are occupied .",
    "particles in the left half of the cluster point to the right and the other half point to the left .",
    "this configuration is stable for vanishing tumble rate with all particles in it jammed .",
    "the remainder particles of the integer division @xmath18 are placed randomly as a gas .",
    "the complementary used of these two initial conditions allows us to identify cases where clusters form by nucleation with long nucleation times and , by comparison of the outcome of the two initial conditions , it is possible to verify that steady state has been achieved .",
    "finally , a third initial condition consists of two nearby clusters , with the objective to test if coarsening takes place .    in all simulations presented in this article ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath19 sites with total simulation times equal to @xmath20 time steps .",
    "simulations are long enough to reach steady state and to achieve good statistical sampling .",
    "figure [ qualitativedescription ] shows the spatio ",
    "temporal diagrams obtained in simulations of the model for different parameters and the three initial conditions previously described .",
    "three final states are observed .",
    "particles can form a gaseous phase , with few particles jammed while the majority moves freely .",

    ", the total number of particles in single large clusters constitute an important fraction of the total number of particles .",
    "this phase is obtained for low values of tumbling rate when @xmath21 , consistent with a related model presented in ref .",

    "are stable for small values of the tumbling rate but evaporate when increasing this value .    in the coarsening phase , there is a tendency to form large clusters .",
    "this process is extremely slow , as particles in a cluster can not move , and clusters move as a result of the effective diffusion of the borders by absorption  evaporation processes . figure  [ qualitativedescription](e ) displays the merging of two clusters , seeded initially close to each other .",
    "this processes is conducted by the evaporation of one cluster into the second , by random tumbling of the particles in their borders . as a result of the accumulated random processes",
    ", there is a larger probability for the smaller cluster to evaporate into the larger , hence leading to a coarsening process .",
    "fluctuations can also produce the complete evaporation of a cluster into the gas , increasing its density beyond the saturation point ; as a result a cluster is later nucleated as shown in fig .",

    "[ profiles ] .",
    "stability of clusters require that the particles in the border must point to the interior , otherwise they could evaporate immediately .",
    "the site at the border is fully occupied .",
    "the site besides it , toward the exterior of the cluster , can be partially occupied , again with all particles pointing to the interior .",
    "the average occupation of this lateral site , the `` shoulder '' , is @xmath34 . in summary , each cluster border consists on two sites , with total occupation @xmath35 . as a consequence of the exclusion volume , particles inside a cluster can not move and the cluster borders move by absorption of particles that arrive or by the evaporation of one particle in the border region after tumbling . only the two extreme sites at each border are dynamically active .",
    "the border moves when the last site saturates and a new shoulder site starts to develop or when all the particles in the border evaporate .",
    "the interior sites , on the other side , are almost dynamically inert because most of the them are jammed and tumbling does not allow them to escape . a few sites , however , are not fully occupied and defects diffuse in the interior as shown in fig .  [ qualitativedescription](c ) .    in the coarsening phase , where there is a single cluster , the gas has a fixed average density just below clusterization .",
    "hence , the position of the cluster borders , which move by random evaporation and absorption processes , must fluctuate coherently to maintain the total mass of the cluster fixed on average [ see figs .",
    "[ qualitativedescription](d)-(f ) ]    in summary , the global dynamics is characterized by the permanent particle exchange between clusters via partial or total evaporation and the spontaneous nucleation of clusters in gas due to fluctuations .",
    "a common feature is that clusters have abrupt walls as is shown in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] .",
    "therefore , clusters with a smooth density profile are not stable : before saturation particles are not affected by the presence of other particles in the site and the smooth cluster will evolve either to evaporation or to the formation of a saturated cluster with abrupt walls .",

    "the case with @xmath2 , with a gas of clusters of sizes distributed exponentially @xcite seems radically different of the cases with large @xmath1 where few large clusters are formed and coarsening takes place . with the objective of characterizing the transition between these regimes , we define and analyze in the steady state two order parameters that give complementary information on the degree of clusterization and coarsening .",
    "the first order parameter @xmath11 is the average fraction of jammed particles , namely those that can not move because they point to a site that is fully occupied .",

    "the transition line can be computed by balancing the particle fluxes at the cluster boundaries .",
    "the outgoing flux of evaporating particles is given by the average number of particles in the two sites that compose each border , @xmath35 , times the tumble rate , resulting in @xmath43 .",
    "the incoming flux is given by the particles that approach the boundary , which then equals half the particle density in the gas phase , @xmath44 . if @xmath45 is the width of the cluster , the conservation of the total number of particles gives , @xmath46 , which combined with the flux balance results in @xmath47 .",
