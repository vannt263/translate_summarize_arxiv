    "nuclear bremsstrahlung refers to a radiative transition between nuclear states which lie in the continuum .",
    "this paper principally focuses on nucleus - nucleus bremsstrahlung , where the photon emission is induced by a collision between two nuclei or a nucleus and a neutron .",
    "however , the emission of bremsstrahlung photons can also accompany proton decays , @xmath1 decays , or fissions .",
    "the common essential feature of these processes is that both initial and final states are not square - integrable in stationary approaches .",
    "this feature leads in some bremsstrahlung models  @xcite to divergent matrix elements , which have to be replaced by some finite values via some regularization prescription .",
    "then , the difficult problem of analyzing the influence of the regularization techniques on the results arises .",
    "this problem is avoided in other bremsstrahlung models  @xcite , which are based from the beginning only on convergent matrix elements . to understand the presence or the absence of divergence problems in different bremsstrahlung models",

    "the description of electromagnetic transitions in nuclear systems relies on the interaction between the nuclear current and the electromagnetic field .",
    "when the long - wavelength approximation ( lwa ) can be applied , the interaction between the nuclear current and the electric field does not explicitly depend on the nuclear current anymore but can be deduced exclusively from the charge density .",
    "this property is referred to as the siegert theorem  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly useful in nuclear physics where the current density is usually less well known than the charge density . however , in the study of radiative transitions between continuum states , the long - wavelength approximation leads to mathematical divergences and the dependence on the nuclear current can not thus be fully removed in bremsstrahlung models .    to avoid this divergence problem ,",
    "most authors decided not to apply the siegert theorem in bremsstrahlung models  @xcite . for potential models of bremsstrahlung , where the colliding nuclei are treated as point - like particles interacting with an effective nucleus - nucleus interaction ,",
    "some authors preferred to apply the siegert theorem and to replace the divergent integrals by convergent expressions by using some regularization techniques  @xcite . even if applying the siegert theorem seems to simplify the expressions of the matrix elements required to evaluate the bremsstrahlung cross sections , the regularization techniques used in  refs .",
    "@xcite break this apparent simplicity .    in a recent paper  @xcite , an extension of the siegert theorem  @xcite , which does not rely to the long - wavelength approximation and which does not lead to divergent matrix elements ,",
