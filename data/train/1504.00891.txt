    "super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses @xmath5 to @xmath6 populate centres of spiral galaxies with central bulge and centres of massive elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "these smbhs grow through mergers and episodes of gas accretion . during accretion phase , black holes ( bhs )",
    "are indirectly observed as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or quasars , where quasars powered by smbhs with masses @xmath7 were observed as early as @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "those observations showed that bhs had very little time ( @xmath9 ) to grow from initial seeds @xcite .",
    "an extreme example is smbh with mass @xmath10 detected at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it would take a @xmath12 bh seed and continuous ( many e - folding times ) gas accretion at the eddington limit , to grow such massive bh so early . starting with lower mass bh seeds",
    "would require super - eddington accretion .",
    "obvious question is : how massive were the bh seeds from which smbhs formed so early and what are the key smbh growth parameters ? several mechanisms for bh seeds formation have been proposed .",
    "we will briefly discuss the three most popular mechanisms .",
    "pop iii stars , the first metal - free stars that started to form at @xmath13 , might have left bh seeds that grew to smbhs observed in the first billion years after the big bang ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "masses of those bh seeds depend on the masses of pop iii stars , which could be in range @xmath14 @xcite , or even @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "some simulations showed that pop iii stars were not so massive and that they formed in binary systems or in clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but other authors showed that pop iii stars were formed isolated ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is typically assumed in the literature that pop iii stars form bh seeds with masses close to @xmath2 .",
    "previous attempts to form @xmath16 10@xmath17 smbhs at @xmath8 from @xmath2 seeds required continuous accretion close to or exceeding the eddington limit and radiative efficiencies of @xmath18 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . even with combination of bhs mergers and accretion , low - mass bh seeds must grow at the eddington limit for a significant fraction of time or they need to have early stages of super - eddington accretion in order to explain the observed high - redshift quasars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are theoretical uncertainties whether bh seeds can sustain such high accretion rates for a long time ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is even more difficult to form @xmath16 10@xmath17 smbhs at @xmath3 considering that the time available for accretion is even smaller than at @xmath8 .",
    "another possible mechanism for bh seed formation is direct collapse of gas into bh .",
    "this process produces bh seeds with masses in range @xmath19 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown that massive bh seeds formed by direct collapse can reach @xmath0 at @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , bh seeds in these models may still need to accrete at nearly the eddington limit for a significant fraction of time .",
    "the main challenge in direct collapse models is to avoid fragmentation and star formation .",
    "fragmentation will not occur if gas has no mechanism for efficient cooling , that is if there are no metals and if formation of @xmath21 molecules is prevented via strong uv background .",
    "only extremely rare haloes satisfy this condition .",
    "direct collapse is expected to occur in haloes with virial temperature @xmath22 and masses @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "recently , models have been proposed where direct collapse might be possible even without a strong uv radiation background ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but @xcite have shown that those models are not viable because molecular cooling will still occur , as the gas density increases , which leads to fragmentation .",
    "alternatively , major mergers may lead to a rapid gas inflow . in such case",
    ", turbulence may be the inhibitor of fragmentation , and the requirement of metal - free gas may be relaxed @xcite .    the third possible mechanism for bh seed formation is collapsing star clusters .",
    "@xcite suggested model where mergers of pop ii stars lead to the formation of a very massive star which collapses into a bh with mass @xmath25 , at @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite proposed a model of a star cluster which contains only bhs and main sequence low mass stars .",
    "more massive bhs sink to the centre and form bh cluster which further collapses and forms massive bh with mass @xmath12 , at @xmath27 .",
    "these seeds can grow via mergers and accretion to form smbhs .",
    "some authors showed that such seeds could explain observed quasars at @xmath28 but have trouble explaining quasars at higher redshifts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    bh mergers could contribute to the smbh growth .",
    "@xcite argued that growth of the most massive bh at high redshift is solely due to the accretion and that mergers can be neglected .",
    "their conclusion is based on : the fact that only a small number of high - redshift haloes are capable of hosting pop iii stars ; pop iii star formation rate is reduced due to lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation field ; and the results of the recent large - scale cosmological simulations tracking the buildup of smbh , where it is claimed that mergers do not affect the growth of smbhs @xcite .",
    "simulation by @xcite does show that negligible fraction of high - redshift smbh mass is acquired in mergers but this is a consequence of the poor mass resolution .",
    "their simulation does not form haloes smaller than @xmath29 . while it is true that pop iii star formation can not take place in smallest haloes , it does occur in haloes with @xmath30 which corresponds to @xmath31 at redshift @xmath20 .",
    "also , haloes with @xmath32 are most likely self - shielded from lw radiation due to the large @xmath33 column density @xcite .",
    "hence , it is clear that haloes with mass @xmath34 host pop iii stars and if these stars produce massive bhs , then their mergers should be relevant to the growth of high redshift smbhs .",
    "we investigate if light bh seeds ( @xmath2 ) planted into haloes of millennium simulation ( @xmath35 ) and millennium - ii simulation ( @xmath36 ) can grow into smbhs that have been observed at @xmath3 .",
    "we also investigate if gravitational wave recoil could prevent the formation of smbh . during a bh merger gravitational wave radiation",
    "is produced .",
    "asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation can lead to bh kick .",
    "gravitational waves carry a non - zero net linear momentum , which establishes a preferential direction for the propagation of the waves and the centre of mass of the binary recoils in the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the gravitational wave recoil depends on the mass ratio of bhs , the spin magnitude and orientation with respect to the binary orbital plane and the eccentricity of the orbit ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational wave recoil can eject a newly formed bh from the host halo if the bh speed is larger than the escape velocity from the halo centre .",
    "bhs can be kicked with a speed as large as @xmath37 in special orbital configurations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; campanelli 2007 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at high redshift",
    ", dark matter haloes generally have small masses and thus small escape velocities , so bh with speed @xmath38 can be ejected even from the most massive haloes at redshift @xmath39 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . this effect may play a major role in suppressing the growth of smbh through mergers .",
    "large scale structure formation and galaxy dynamics lead to bh mergers . if those mergers are ignored , bh growth depends on three gas accretion parameters .",
    "those parameters are radiative efficiency , eddington ratio and the time that a bh spends accreting .",
    "radiative luminosity of a bh , @xmath40 , which is accreting at a rate @xmath41 , is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the speed of light and @xmath44 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "eddington ratio is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 $ ] is eddington luminosity .",
    "the accretion rate at which a bh will radiate at a given eddington ratio is given by :    @xmath47    after integration the final bh mass @xmath48 , as a function of its initial mass @xmath49 is :    @xmath50\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 i @xmath53 are the ages of the universe when the bh attains its final mass and at the time of seed formation , respectively @xcite .",
    "radiative efficiency is the efficiency of conversion of rest - mass into energy during accretion and it depends on the bh spin .",
    "radiative efficiency can take values from 0.057 for accretion on to schwarzschild bhs to 0.42 for fast rotating kerr bhs @xcite .",
    "mean value of radiative efficiency for quasars can be estimated by comparing the local smbh mass density with the total agn luminosity per unit volume in the universe integrated over time @xcite .",
    "this is soltan s argument .",
    "previous works based on soltan s argument showed that the mean value of radiative efficiency is @xmath54 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some authors have found that radiative efficiency changes with the redshift ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and increases with the mass of the accreting bh ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    it is usually assumed that bh luminosity during accretion can not be greater than the eddington luminosity .",
    "however , evidence for super - eddington accretion has been growing recently .",
    "@xcite used a sample of @xmath16 58,000 quasars at @xmath55 from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr7 catalogue @xcite to estimate their eddington ratios .",
    "they found that the highest observed eddington ratio for quasars is @xmath56 , but that those quasars which radiate above the eddington limit are rare .",
    "@xcite observed three quasars , mrk 335 , mrk 142 and iras f12397 + 3333 , using the 2.4-m shangri - la telescope at the yunnan observatory in china .",
    "one of their goals was to measure bh masses and eddington ratios .",
    "they found that the lower limits on the eddington ratios for these objects are 0.6 , 2.3 , and 4.6 .",
    "@xcite have shown that soft x - ray spectrum of the highest redshift quasar yet found , ulas j112001.48 + 064124.3 at @xmath11 @xcite , obtained with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , suggests that the quasar is accreting above the eddington limit , @xmath59 .",
    "their findings of moderate super - eddington accretion are consistent with the eddington ratio estimated from the uv luminosity of that object , @xmath60 @xcite . in order to fit the observed statistics of far - infrared and x - ray spectra of agns at",
    "@xmath61 @xcite assumed model where eddington ratio depends on the redshift . during the exponential growth of the bh , the maximum eddington ratio is @xmath62 for @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for @xmath65 , with constant radiative efficiency @xmath66 .",
    "similar results have been found by @xcite , who has also explored the possibility of having a short super - eddington accretion followed by a sub - eddington accretion in order to explain the presence of bhs with masses @xmath67 smbhs at @xmath8",
    ".    a recent analysis of bh scaling relations showed that the normalization of the bh mass - bulge relation should be increased by a factor of 5 , from the previously accepted value of @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "this increases the local mass density in bhs by the same factor and decreases the required mean radiative efficiency to values that can not be reasonably explained in terms of luminous thin - disc accretion .",
    "this may be evidence for the radiatively inefficient super - eddington accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these works have showed that quasars , at least at some point in their evolution , can accrete at the super - eddington luminosities .",
    "recent numerical simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) of super - eddington accretion suggest that those sources are most likely to be characterized by strongly collimated outflows or jets .",
    "accretion in these simulations is mildly super - eddington , @xmath70 .",
    "theoretical works by @xcite assumed early stages of super - eddington quasi - spherical accretion estimated using the bondi - hoyle formula @xcite . in this case , when the inflow rate is super - critical , the radiative efficiency drops .",
    "hence , the eddington luminosity is not greatly exceeded ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the accretion rate is initially super - critical by a factor of 10 and then grows up to a factor of about @xmath72 .",
    "they showed that bh seeds with initial mass of @xmath15 could explain smbh at @xmath8 if they go through early phases of super - eddington accretion and bh mergers .",
    "similar approach has been recently argued by @xcite .",
    "they showed that short - lived intermittent episodes of super - eddington accretion ( @xmath73 ) may increase the bh mass by several orders of magnitude in @xmath74 years .",
    "the authors assumed slim disc solution where the luminosity during accretion depends logarithmically on the accretion rate . since ( @xmath75 )",
    ", if the effective radiative efficiency is low , accretion rate can be highly super - eddington while the emergent luminosity is only mildly super - eddington and feedback is limited .",
    "@xcite extended these works and showed that light bh seeds ( @xmath2 ) could explain quasars with @xmath0 smbh observed at @xmath76 if they have a few episodes of super - eddington accretion via slim accretion disc .",
    "eddington ratio in these works is @xmath77 .",
    "@xcite proposed different mechanism for super - eddington accretion .",
    "momentum driven feedback from an accreting bh gives significant orbital energy but little angular momentum to the surrounding gas . once central accretion drops , the feedback weakens and gas falls back towards the bh , forming a small scale accretion disc .",
    "the feeding rates into the disc typically exceed eddington by factor of a few .",
    "based on the mentioned works it can be concluded that super - eddington accretion is inevitable for the growth of smbhs .",
    "another important question is for how long accretion can be sustained ?",
    "quasars lifetimes can be estimated using soltan s argument .",
    "amount of matter accreted on to quasars during their lifetime , represented by the luminosity density due to accretion , should be less than or equal to the space density of remnant bhs in the local universe @xcite .",
    "this method depends on the value of radiative efficiency .",
    "another way to estimate this parameter is to ask what value of quasars lifetime is required if all bright galaxies go through a quasar phase .",
    "this approach is not sensitive to the value of radiative efficiency , but it is affected by the assumed value of eddington ratio and galaxy mergers @xcite . computed values for the duration of accretion using this approach are from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "typical accretion time for majority of quasars is salpeter s time @xcite .",
    "salpeter s time is e - folding time - scale for smbh growth and its typical value is @xmath80 :    @xmath81    a single massive bh seed ( @xmath82 ) needs to continuously accrete at eddington luminosity for 380 - 500 myr ( which corresponds to 9 - 11 e - folding times ) to be able to grow to @xmath83 at redshift @xmath76 .",
    "light bh seed ( @xmath84 ) requires 19 e - folding times or 840 myr of accretion .",
    "alternatively , it would take 280 myr at eddington ratio 3 ( also 19 e - folding times ) .",
    "this means that it would be very hard to grow smbh from light seeds at the eddington limit by @xmath63 and impossible by @xmath1 .",
    "some authors assumed such long quasar lifetimes in order to match observed quasars number density at high redshifts ( @xcite ; tyler 2003 ; sijacki 2009 ; @xcite ; tanaka 2012 ; @xcite ) .    continuous accretion at or above",
    "the eddington limit might be problematic due to the feedback .",
    "radiation and kinetic power in matter outflows could be so strong that once the accreting bh gets too big , it blows out all of the gas in the centre of its host galaxy , shutting down the accretion on to the bh @xcite .",
    "if continuous growth at the eddington limit can not be maintained , the main alternative to these models are short periods of super - eddington accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , observations show that , in most cases , quasars lifetimes are comparable with salpeter s time and eddington ratios are between 0.1 and 1 .",
    "time that smbh spends accreting depends on radiative efficiency , eddington ratio and bh mass @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that quasar lifetime is a function of bh mass .",
    "they found that the mean lifetime is @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is obvious that if one assumes these typical values of the growth parameters , it would be impossible to grow smbh at high redshift even if we start with seeds as massive as 10@xmath88 .",
    "accretion would have to be either super - eddington or prolonged for more than salpeter s time ( many e - folding times instead of one ) .",
    "our goal is to examine if bh mergers combined with accretion episodes in merger trees of millennium simulation @xcite and millennium - ii simulation @xcite contribute to the growth of @xmath89 smbh at @xmath3 .",
    "if they do , then values of eddington ratios and numbers of e - folding times during the merger induced accretion episodes in merger tree branches can be lowered to a more reasonable values .",
    "growth of a smbh in halo that undergoes several major mergers does not require continuous accretion for many e - folding times . since the rate of major mergers increases with redshift , smbhs in high - redshift quasars",
    "can grow nearly continuously in a sequence of major mergers ( li 2012 , @xcite ) .",
    "every major merger will reset previous accretion episode and trigger a new one which effectively reduces number of e - folding times .",
    "that in turn could increase the likelihood of low - mass bhs as smbh seeds .    in section 2",
    "we describe the method . in section 3",
    "we present our results .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section 4 .",
    "our goal is to produce smbh with mass @xmath90 at @xmath3 from light bh seeds using publicly available data from both millennium simulation @xcite and millennium - ii simulation @xcite . as a constraint we use comparison between the observed and calculated bh mass function from our model at @xmath91 .",
    "millennium simulation @xcite is a large @xmath92-body simulation which follows @xmath93 particles within a periodic simulation cube of side length @xmath94 .",
    "each simulation particle has mass @xmath95 .",

    "millennium - ii simulation @xcite uses the same cosmology and the same number of particles as the millennium simulation , but in a five times smaller box ( @xmath110 ) and thus with 125 times better mass resolution .",
    "each simulation particle in millennium - ii simulation has mass @xmath111 .",
    "millennium - ii simulation uses gadget-3 code , updated version of gadget code ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "current dominant cosmological paradigm is cdm , which predicts bottom - up mode of structure formation , that is , small dark matter haloes forming first and then merging into larger haloes later in the life of the universe .",
    "since millennium - ii simulation has 125 times better mass resolution than millennium simulation , it allows as to track bh growth by mergers of highest redshift low mass haloes which are too small to be resolved due to the lower mass resolution of millennium simulation . on the other hand",
    ", it is questionable if it is possible to produce a @xmath89 smbh at @xmath3 in a simulation box with sides of length that millennium - ii simulation has due to low population of highest mass haloes . in order to have both small haloes and large box ,",
    "we develop a method to use bhs produced in merger trees of millennium - ii simulation , as bh seeds in merger trees of millennium simulation , which enable us to cover both haloes that are forming very early and abundant highest mass haloes later .      with @xmath2 bh seeds placed in millennium - ii haloes",
    "we produce bh growth history . from it , because of the higher mass resolution of millennium - ii simulation , we have information about earliest halo formation history .    first , we make merger trees which track dark matter halo merger history in millennium - ii simulation from redshift @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "halo is defined as self - bound structures with at least 20 particles .",
    "merger history of bhs corresponds to the merger history of haloes assuming that each halo hosts one bh and that two bhs merge right after their host halo merge .",
    "we have distinguished between minor and major mergers .",
    "merger is major if @xmath114 for @xmath115 . in the case of a minor",
    "merger , mass of the newly formed bh is a simple sum of the previous bh masses . in the case of a major merger ,",
    "newly formed bh is also accreting gas according to the accretion recipe described in following subsections . in each halo of millennium - ii simulation we place one bh seed with @xmath2 and assume fixed values for radiative efficiency and accretion time - scale in every accretion episode .",
    "hence , the only variable in our model is the eddington ratio .",
    "next , we use millennium simulation which has simulation box five times larger ( @xmath94 ) in order to compare final bh masses in merger trees of this simulation to the observed bh mass function .",
    "we apply the same bh growth recipe to the haloes of millennium simulation .",
    "the difference is , time the seed bh mass is the most common bh mass estimated in the merger trees of millennium - ii simulation .",
    "we use millennium - ii simulation to determine a typical bh mass for a specific host halo mass .",
    "we do it by binning masses of resulting bhs at each snapshot and halo mass interval and then choosing central value of the most occupied bin .",
    "hence , at every redshift we know the range of bh masses hosted by haloes with a specific mass .",
    "we select the typical ( most common mass ) bh and use it as a bh seed in each newly formed halo of millennium simulation at the matching redshift and halo mass obtained from millennium - ii , thus extending our sample to include highest mass haloes .",
    "note that this is a conservative way to populate haloes since we are losing instances when bh mass is in reality more massive than the common one .",
    "first , we use millennium - ii data base to select haloes with masses @xmath116 at redshift @xmath113 . for all selected haloes",
    "we find their progenitor haloes , i.e. haloes that have merged at the previous snapshot to form selected haloes .",
    "haloes have merged if they have the same descendant halo .",
    "we repeat this procedure up to redshift @xmath112 where first mergers are recorded .",
    "once we find all of the haloes that take part in formation of the selected haloes , we form merger trees for each of them .",
    "final haloes at redshift @xmath113 are called main haloes .",
    "mergers of the main halo form the main branch of the merger tree .",

    "we follow not only mergers of the main halo , but also take into account mergers in all side branches .    in a single merger event the most massive progenitor halo",
    "is called primary halo and other progenitor haloes are satellite haloes . in the millennium - ii simulation output",
    "is printed with time resolution @xmath117 , so the common case is that large number of haloes have the same descendant halo ( case with largest number of progenitors being 186 ) .",
    "the question is which halo is the primary halo and which haloes are satellite haloes ? to solve this we first find the most massive progenitor halo ( primary halo ) and then using the comoving coordinates of the centre of mass , we calculate distances to other progenitor haloes ( satellite haloes ) , sort them in the order from closest to furthest away and assume that they have merged in that order .",
    "we calculate halo mass ratio of the merging haloes and distinguish minor and major mergers .",
    "we repeat the same procedure for haloes in millennium simulation that have masses @xmath118 at redshift @xmath113 .      final bh mass depends on the initial bh mass , eddington ratio , radiative efficiency and accretion time - scale ( equation 2 . ) . in our model",

    "most of the bh mergers with mass ratios close to one occur in low mass haloes . as low mass haloes have small gravitational potentials , final bh after the merger can easily be ejected .",

    "bhs that form in larger haloes are protected from ejection by the large gravitational potentials.,width=340 ]        to further investigate the influence of the gravitational wave recoil , we calculate and compare kick value with the value of the halo escape velocity .",

    "the authors show distribution of gravitational recoil for two models : when the spin parameters are chosen from a uniform distribution and when it is assumed that the bh spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "we accepted their model when bh spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum ( their fig .",
    "2 , red region ) and we used maximum of the kick velocity distribution ( their fig .",
    "2 , red line ) to assign values of kick velocities to the merging bhs in our model .",
    "escape velocity is calculated as described in @xcite .",
    "circular velocity of a halo at the virial radius is @xcite : @xmath150 where @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 at the merger redshift .",
    "the authors assumed that the dark matter haloes are described with nfw profile @xcite with a concentration parameter @xmath154 out to the virial radius , as expected for a newly formed dark - matter halo @xcite . under those assumptions",
    "the escape velocity from the halo s centre is @xmath155 .",
    "5 shows the number of bh mergers as a function of the mass of the newly formed bh .",
    "if bh kick velocity is larger than the escape velocity from the host halo , newly formed bh could be ejected from the halo ( grey filled histogram ) .",
    "blue histograms with horizontal lines represent bhs whose kick velocities are smaller than the escape velocities .",
    "the figure shows that low - mass bhs reside in low mass haloes and have their kick velocities larger than the escape velocities from their host haloes , so they are sensitive to the gravitational wave recoil .",
    "on the other hand , we use simple model in which we assume that each newly formed halo in millennium - ii simulation hosts a bh with the initial mass of @xmath2 .",
    "possibility that two merging bhs have exactly the same mass is very small .",
    "first bhs have initial mass function ( imf ) , with masses in wide range .",
    "imf for pop iii bh remnants is not fully understood due to uncertainty in primordial gas fragmentation during pop iii star formation .",
    "pop iii stars with masses in range @xmath156 are believed to leave bh remnants with masses @xmath157 while more massive stars , @xmath158 , leave bhs with masses @xmath159 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such imf would significantly reduce the mass ratio of merging bhs . in turn",
    "this would lower the value of gravitational wave recoil .",
    "in this paper we test under which conditions light bh seeds ( 100 @xmath160 ) placed in haloes of millennium - ii simulation @xcite and millennium simulation @xcite merger trees can grow to smbhs with masses @xmath0 that have been observed at @xmath3 .",
    "we make merger trees which track dark matter halo merger history from redshift @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "we assume that each halo hosts one bh and that two bhs merge right after their host haloes merge .",
    "bh can grow in bh mergers and by gas accretion .",
    "we have distinguished between minor and major mergers . in the case of a minor merger , mass of the newly formed bh",
    "is a simple sum of the previous bh masses .",
    "major merger leads to the formation of a new bh and it triggers the gas accretion on to that bh . final bh mass depends on the initial bh mass , eddington ratio , radiative efficiency and quasar lifetime ( equation 2 . ) .",
    "effective radiative efficiency is fixed at @xmath119 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and each accretion episode is limited to 50 myr , which is @xmath16 salpeter s time for accretion at the eddington limit .",
    "eddington ratio is a free parameter in our model , but it has fixed value for each accretion episode in one simulation run . if a new major merger occurs before the maximum allowed time for accretion has passed , accretion is reset and the new accretion episode begins .",
    "also , accretion can be stopped if bh mass exceeds 8 @xmath161 10@xmath162 of the host halo mass , so we make sure that the gas reservoir never gets depleted .",
    "we combine millennium - ii and millennium merger trees in order to have both : early halo formation history with low - mass haloes ( to track bh growth history ) ; and a large box giving us abundant highest mass haloes later ( in which @xmath89 smbh at @xmath3 can be produced ) .",
    "first we place @xmath2 bh seeds in haloes of millennium - ii simulation which has 125 times better mass resolution to make bh growth history .",
    "then we take most common bhs from millennium - ii simulation as seeds for millennium simulation to produce @xmath89 smbh at @xmath3 .",
    "we run the set of semi - analytical simulations where we assign same initial masses of @xmath2 to all bh seeds and the same value for the effective eddington ratio during the episodes of accretion .",
    "we investigate what value of the effective eddington ratio match two conditions : bh mass function in our model can not exceed bh mass function given by @xcite and our merger trees need to produce @xmath89 smbh at @xmath1 .",
    "we find that remnants of pop iii stars can produce @xmath0 smbh at redshifts @xmath1 if at each accretion episode they are able to accrete at the effective eddington ratio of @xmath4 .",
    "recent observations have suggested that moderate super - eddington accretion ( @xmath163 ) might be possible ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the question is then how long can accretion maintain rates above the eddington limit ?",
    "some authors argued that quasars lifetimes are much shorter then the salpeter s time - scale ( e.g , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in that case , even massive bh seeds do not have enough time to grow to @xmath90 smbh at redshift @xmath164 .",
    "a single bh seed with mass @xmath5 requires nine e - folding times to produce @xmath90 smbh at @xmath1 , while @xmath2 seed requires 19 e - folding times for the same smbh .",
    "because of this requirement some previous works rejected pop iii star remnants as possible candidates for smbh seeds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in our model",
    ", growing smbh at @xmath1 does not require e - folding time larger than @xmath131 for @xmath2 bh seeds and effective @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we have managed to reduce the time that bh needs to spend accreting . in our model , every major merger restarts the accretion , hence , instead of one bh constantly accreting for a long time ( large number of e - folding times ) we have several bhs in shorter ( small number of e - folding times ) accretion episodes .",
    "this approach increases the importance of mergers on smbh growth .",
    "our model requires prolonged super - eddington accretion which could produce strong feedback that stops the inflow of gas towards smbh and disrupts the smbh accretion long before 50 myr .",
    "this could occur if we would assume the classical thin disc accretion .",
    "however , we do not assume any accretion model in advance .",
    "the chosen values for the radiative efficiency and the eddington ratio in our model should be regarded as the effective values , averaged over 50 myr .",
    "bh could also grow through a sequence of short - lived intermittent phases of super - eddington accretion ( @xmath165 ) without the feedback .",
    "eddington ratio averaged over @xmath166 would then be @xmath4 and effectively this model would produce the same smbh as in the thin disc model .",
    "the absence of feedback in the slim disc model comes from @xmath75 .",
    "bh mass growth rate could stay the same as radiative efficiency decreases and @xmath167 increases . in principle , given a sufficiently low efficiency , a super - eddington bh may be emitting at sub - eddington luminosity , thus eliminating bh feedback completely @xcite .    * in light of the recent observations of super - eddington accretion mentioned above , we show that with a moderate super - eddington accretion @xmath168 averaged over 50 myr , even low mass seeds @xmath169 could be progenitors of high redshift smbhs @xmath170 . *    note that our model is conservative for three reasons :    \\(1 ) all bh seeds in our model have the same mass of @xmath2 .",
    "it is possible that pop iii stars left bh seeds with masses up to @xmath171 @xcite , or even @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "larger mass of bh seeds would significantly reduce need for accretion which would , in turn , effectively lower the value of the effective eddington ratio .",
    "\\(2 ) we combine two simulations which is also a conservative approximation",
    ". we do not know the exact merger history of low mass haloes in millennium simulation , but instead we take it from millennium - ii simulation .",
    "we always chose the most common bhs from millennium - ii simulation to be the seeds for newly formed haloes of millennium simulation . if we would have chosen just a few bhs with mass greater than the most common mass , that would strongly affect bh growth history .",
    "this in turn would reduce the eddington ratio necessary for smbh growth .",
    "\\(3 ) in our model bh growth is limited by the amount of gas that bh can accrete ( @xmath121 of the host halo mass ) .",
    "this constraint comes from the bh mass scaling relations in the local universe .",
    "however , the same scaling relation may not hold in the early universe .",
    "recently , @xcite measured @xmath172 for quasar ulas",
    "j1120 + 0641 at @xmath173 .",
    "they found that the bh was growing much faster than the bulge relative to the mass ratio measured in the local universe .",
    "if bhs at high redshift had more gas available for the accretion , bh growth would be much easier which would also reduce the value of the effective eddington ratio .",
    "some authors have speculated that bh mergers have a limited role in smbh growth due to gravitational wave recoil ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate bh kick velocities and compare it to the escape velocities of their host haloes .",
    "we find that bhs with low masses reside in low mass haloes and have their kick velocities larger than the escape velocities from their host haloes , so they are sensitive to the gravitational wave recoil .",
    "this is a consequence of a simple model where all bh seeds have the same mass which is highly unlikely .",
    "using a proper initial bh mass function with a wide range of possible masses would lower the value of gravitational wave recoil .",
