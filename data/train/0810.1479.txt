    "first , the equations are posed over an unbounded domain , which makes numerically solving the system infeasible .",
    "second , the @xmath6-equation is the fully nonlinear monge - ampre equation .",

    "for the reader s convenience and to provide necessary background , we shall first give a concise derivation of the hoskins semigeostrophic flow equations @xcite and then explain how the hoskins model is reformulated as a coupled monge - ampre / transport system .",
    "although our derivation essentially follows those of @xcite , we shall make an effort to streamline the ideas and key steps in a way which we thought should be more accessible to the numerical analysis community .",

    "recall that @xmath35 .",
    "finally , @xmath36 , assumed to be a positive constant , is known as _ the coriolis parameter _ , and @xmath37 is the gravitational acceleration constant .",
    "we note that the term @xmath38 is the so - called coriolis force which is an artifact of the earth s rotation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    ignoring the ( low order ) material derivative term in",
    "we get @xmath39 where @xmath40 equation is known as _ the geostrophic balance _ , which describes the balance between the pressure gradient force and the coriolis force in the horizontal directions .",

    "the geostrophic and hydrostatic balances give very simple relations between the pressure field and the velocity field .",
    "however , the dynamics of the fluids are missing in the description . to overcome this limitation , j. b. hoskins @xcite proposed so - called semigeostrophic approximation which is based on replacing the material derivative term @xmath42 by @xmath43 in .",

    "should @xmath49 be replaced by @xmath50 in the material derivative , the resulting model is known as _ the quasi - geostrophic flow equations _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    due to the peculiar structure of the semigeostrophic flow equations , it is difficult to analyze and to numerically solve the equations .",
    "the first successful analytical approach is the one based on the fully nonlinear reformulation  , which was first proposed in @xcite and was further developed in @xcite ( see @xcite for a different approach ) .",
    "the main idea of the reformulation is to use time - dependent curved coordinates so the resulting system becomes partially decoupled .",
    "apparently , the trade - off is the presence of stronger nonlinearity in the new formulation .",
    "the derivation of the fully nonlinear reformulation  starts with introducing the so - called _ geopotential _ and _ geostrophic transformation _",
