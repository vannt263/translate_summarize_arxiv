    "motivated by the observed photospheric magnetic flux emergence pattern , the simulation assumes the emergence of an east - west oriented magnetic flux rope into a pre - existing coronal magnetic field constructed based on the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho)/michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) full - disk magnetogram of the photospheric magnetic field at 20:51:01 ut on december 12 .",
    "it is found that several observed features of the cme source region and the eruptive flare , such as the pre - eruption x - ray sigmoid , the evolution of the flare ribbons , and the morphology of the x - ray post - flare loop brightening , can be qualitatively explained by the modeled coronal magnetic field evolution .",
    "the simulation results in the eruption of a coronal flux rope that reaches a terminal speed of about 830 km / s and shows significant writhing or rotation as it erupts .",
    "however , because of the narrow simulation domain used ( about @xmath3 in latitudinal width ) , the erupting flux rope that expands rapidly becomes severely constrained by the side boundary walls almost immediately after the onset of the eruption and its acceleration and rotation are significantly impacted .",
    "as can be seen in figure 7 of f11 , the erupting flux rope begins to hit the south boundary wall soon after the onset of eruption when the front of the cavity has only just reached about 1.3 solar radii . the subsequent acceleration and evolution ( including the expansion and rotation ) of the flux rope",
    "are then severely impeded and constrained by the side walls and can not be properly followed . in this work",
    ", we improve upon the simulation of f11 by significantly widening the simulation domain ( to about @xmath4 in latitudinal width and about @xmath5 in longitudinal width ) , and inclusion of a much more extended region of the observed photospheric normal flux distribution in the construction of the pre - existing coronal potential field .",
    "the latter also provides a more accurate description of the decline profile with height of the confining potential magnetic field , which would affect the development of the torus instability and the acceleration of the flux rope in the lower corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we found that the resulting erupting flux rope accelerates to a higher terminal speed of about 1500 km / s .",
    "it undergoes a counter - clockwise rotation ( as viewed from above ) of about @xmath1 , such that both the front and the flanks of the final expanding flux rope are showing southward directed magnetic field , opposite to the field direction for the top of the pre - eruption flux rope and the its overlying potential field .",
    "for the simulation carried out in this study , we solve the mhd equations in spherical geometry as given in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we assume an ideal gas with a low adiabatic index @xmath6 for the coronal plasma , which allows it to maintain its high temperature without an explicit coronal heating .",
    "the mhd equations are solved numerically with the mfe code described in f12 .",
    "no explicit viscosity and magnetic diffusion are included in the momentum and the induction equations .",
    "however numerical dissipations are present at regions of sharp gradient and the non - adiabatic heating due to numerical dissipation is implicitly converted into the internal energy by solving the total energy equation in conservative form . compared to the simulation of f11 , the difference in the formulation is that here we also include the field - aligned thermal conduction in the energy equation as given in f12 , which was not included in the previous simulation of f11 .",

    "the value of @xmath84 is a measure of the twist rate of the magnetic field , and the height range where @xmath84 is significantly negative indicates the height range of the flux rope cross - section .",
    "we see from figure [ fig : bpdecay_alpha ] that the top of the flux rope cross - section has reached about @xmath85 as marked by the vertical dotted lines and that the top portion of the flux rope has reached the region where the decay rate of the potential magnetic field @xmath86 has exceeded the magnitude of 1.5 , which is the threshold for the flux rope to develop the torus instability ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus both the helical kink instability and the torus instability are likely playing a role in triggering the eruption of the coronal flux rope .",
    "we found that with a wider simulation domain and the inclusion of a wider range of the observed ambient normal flux distribution on the lower boundary , the magnitude of the decay rate of the potential field is greater compared to that obtained for f11 , in the lower height range from 0 to @xmath87 .",
    "this might have contributed to a higher terminal speed of the erupting flux rope in the present case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the dominant reason for the lower saturation speed of the front of the flux rope found in f11 is due to the side wall boundary which begins to impede the acceleration of the flux rope soon after the onset of the eruption ( see figure 7 of f11 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : cfdl_sigmoidsh ] shows 3d field lines ( colored based on the temperature ) of the coronal magnetic field at a time ( @xmath88 hour ) just before the onset of the eruption ( panel ( a ) ) , compared with the hinode x - ray telescope ( xrt ) image of the region just prior to the onset of the flare ( panel ( b ) ) .",

    "[ fig : cfdl_sigmoidsh](a ) we have densely traced these highly heated field lines , whose temperature has reached about 10 mk .",

    "* see their figure 1 ) .    after the flare onset , the soft x - ray emission becomes completely dominated by the brightening of a sigmoid - shaped row of post - flare loops as shown in a hinode xrt image in figure [ fig : hinode_ribbon_xray](b ) , and the corresponding hinode solar optical telescope ( sot ) observation ( figure [ fig : hinode_ribbon_xray](a ) ) shows the two - ribbon brightening in the lower atmosphere .",
    "the two bright ribbons correspond to the foot points of the heated post flare loops , where energetic electrons and downward heat conduction along the post reconnection loops cause heating and brightening in the lower atmosphere . in figure",
    "[ fig : ribbon_xray](a ) we show an image of the gradient of temperature increase with height at the lower boundary , which is a measure of the downward heat conduction along the loops rooted there .",
    "this is shown at time @xmath89 hour , just after the peak acceleration of the eruption .",
    "it marks the location of the foot points of strongly heated loops as a result rapid reconnection in the simulation .",
    "we see two curved bright ribbons , which show some similarities in their paths and locations in relation to the normal magnetic flux distribution ( contours in figure [ fig : ribbon_xray](a ) ) as the observed flare ribbons . for the upper ribbon , its east part extends into the dominant negative pre - existing sunspot and its west part curves about the emerging negative polarity region which corresponds to the emerged , fragmented negative pores to the west of the main negative sunspot in the observation .",

    "this direction of rotation is consistent with the left - handed twist of the pre - eruption flux rope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "by the time the top of the flux rope has reached about @xmath91 ( figures [ fig : erupting_rope_farviews_rev](c)(f ) ) , the flux rope has rotated by about @xmath1 and the @xmath90 of the entire outer circumference of the flux rope has become negative or southward directed .",
    "later the erupting flux rope seems to continually expand outward without further significant change of its orientation , and both the front and flank of the expanding flux rope maintains southward directed @xmath90 as can be seen in the zoomed out views of the later evolution shown in figures [ fig : erupting_rope_farviews_rev](d)(h ) .",
    "this orientation of the expanding flux rope , if maintained in the propagation in the solar wind to the earth , would explain the southward directed magnetic field for the front of the magnetic cloud ( mc ) impacting the earth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this southward directed @xmath90 for the front of the mc appears opposite to the northward @xmath90 for the top of the pre - existing flux rope and the overlying potential field in the cme source region on the sun .",
    "the large ( @xmath92 ) counter - clockwise rotation of the flux rope achieved during the initial phase of the eruption is consistent with the large left - handed twist ( more than 1 wind of field - line rotation about the axis ) stored in the pre - eruption flux rope .",
    "we find that due to continued magnetic reconnection , the erupting flux rope evolves to become completely rooted in the ambient pre - existing normal flux distribution , outside of the emerging bipolar region , as shown in figure [ fig : footpoints_sig_cusp](a ) where the foot points of the field lines of the erupting flux rope in figures [ fig : erupting_rope_farviews_rev](d)(h ) are plotted on the lower boundary against the normal magnetic field distribution .",

    "the reformation of the flux rope and the associated buildup of the free magnetic energy after the magnetic energy release of the first eruption ( see upper panel of figure [ fig : emfree_ek_evol ] ) are setting up for a second eruption .",
    "this may qualitatively explain the buildup for a second x - class flare and cme in the same region the following day on december 14 .",
    "improving upon the previous work of f11 , we have carried out an mhd simulation to qualitatively model the magnetic field evolution of the eruptive flare and cme on 13 december 2006 in the emerging @xmath0-sunspot region ar 10930 .",
    "the main improvement compared to f11 is the significantly widened simulation domain and the inclusion of a much more extended region of the observed photospheric normal flux distribution in the construction of the pre - existing coronal potential field . in this way",
    "the simulation can accommodate the wide cme ( see figure [ fig : vrmeri_dmeri ] ) and better determine the structure and dynamic evolution of the erupting flux rope without it being severely constrained by the boundaries immediately after the onset of the eruption as was the case in f11 .",
    "guided by the observed photospheric magnetic flux emergence pattern in ar 10930 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we impose the emergence of an east - west oriented , left - hand twisted flux rope at the lower boundary .",
    "the resulting flux emergence pattern is such that the positive emerging polarity corresponds to the observed positive ( counter - clockwise ) rotating sunspot emerging against the south end of the pre - existing dominant negative sunspot , and the negative emerging polarity corresponds to the collection of the fragmented negative pores observed to emerge to the west of the @xmath0-spot @xcite . as a result of the flux emergence , a twisted coronal flux rope confined by the pre - existing potential coronal field constructed based on the observed ambient photospheric magnetic field is built up quasi - statically .",
    "the resulting pre - eruption coronal magnetic field shows heated , inverse - s shaped core fields with morphology similar to the bright sigmoid - shaped loops in the pre - eruption region observed in soft x - ray images by hinode xrt .",
    "the flux rope is found to erupt after its field line twist about the axis has reached about 1.2 winds , close to the threshold for the onset of the helical kink instability , and its upper half of the cross - section has entered the height where the decline rate of the corresponding potential field has exceeded the thresh hold for the onset of the torus instability .",
    "the twist of the flux rope at the onset of eruption is within the measured range of twist transported into the corona based on the observation of the rotating positive sunspot . using a measure of the downward heat conduction flux at the lower boundary as the proxy for the location of the flare ribbons",
    ", we found that the path and locations of the ribbons in relation to the normal magnetic flux distribution show qualitative similarities as the observed flare ribbons in the lower solar atmosphere observed by the hinode sot . also the field lines rooted in the bright ribbons form a sigmoid - shaped row of heated loops that show similar morphology to the observed x - ray post flare loop brightening .",
    "the initial potential field overlying the coronal flux rope and also the top of the left - hand twisted coronal flux rope of the source region are both having northward directed ( positive ) @xmath90 field . however , immediately after the onset of the eruption , the erupting flux rope in the cavity is found to undergo a counter - clockwise rotation ( as viewed from above ) by about @xmath93 such that its entire front and flanks are showing southward directed ( negative ) @xmath90 field ( see figure [ fig : erupting_rope_farviews_rev ] ) .",
    "this large rotation of the erupting flux rope is accomplished in the early phase of the eruption and later the flux rope shows mainly outward expansion without further significant change of orientation ( see figures [ fig : erupting_rope_farviews_rev](c)(d ) and figures [ fig : erupting_rope_farviews_rev](f)(h ) ) .",
    "the orientation of such an expanding flux rope in the cme ejecta , if maintained during its propagation in the solar wind , may explain the southward directed magnetic field in the front part of the magnetic cloud impacting the earth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the front of the erupting flux rope is found to accelerate to a terminal speed of about @xmath69 km / s , which is still smaller than the observationally measured range of @xmath2 km / s to @xmath94 km / s for the cme speed determined from soho large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ) observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our simulation also shows that the source region coronal magnetic field driven by the continued flux emergence is capable of reformation of the flux rope and a second eruption and hence explaining the observed occurrence of another eruptive flare on december 14 , 2006 from the same region .",
    "our mhd simulation driven by the emergence of an east - west oriented magnetic flux rope is aimed to model qualitatively the structure and topology of the magnetic field for both the source region and the cme ejecta of the eruptive flare on december 13 , 2006 .",
    "there are many severe limitations of the model .",
    "the smoothing of the observed photospheric field to reduce the peak field strength at the lower boundary to under @xmath95 g , due to numerical constraints , greatly under estimates the free magnetic energy buildup ( about @xmath96 ergs ) and release ( @xmath97 ergs ) for the resulting cme ( figure [ fig : emfree_ek_evol ] ) , compared to the observational estimates ( on the order of @xmath98 ergs ) for the cme energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this would lead to an under estimate of the cme speed .",
    "also , our simulation assumes an initial potential field without an ambient solar wind .",
    "all of these simplifications can affect the resulting cme speed and energetics .",
    "further improvement of the model with more realistic lower boundary conditions and the inclusion of an ambient solar wind with more realistic treatment of the thermodynamics are needed to achieve a quantitative description of the event .",
    "progress is being made in using high - cadence vector magnetic field and doppler velocity observations by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) of the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) to infer the electric field evolution at the photosphre of flare / cme productive active regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such observationally inferred electric fields may be used for constructing more realistic lower boundary driving conditions of flux emergence for the mhd simulations of the cme events .",
