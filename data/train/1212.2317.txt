    "the formation of realistic disc galaxies and their evolution has remained a challenging problem to the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm of galaxy formation @xcite . nevertheless , significant development has occurred in this context in recent years .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamical simulations which include feedback and/or smooth accretion of cold gas through cosmic filaments show that an exponential disc could have assembled either around a classical bulge formed through mergers or as a bulgeless disc galaxy , and survived through the hierarchical assembly @xcite .",
    "soon after their formation , the clumpy discs observed at high - redshift @xcite are believed to go through rapid dynamical evolution where minor mergers , streams of inflowing gas triggering burst of star formation and turbulence played dominant roles .",
    "as these violent processes become less important and frequent @xcite , secular processes which operate on longer time scales ( typically @xmath0s of dynamical time scales ) are thought to play a significant role in the subsequent evolution of the galaxies @xcite . in the secular phase ,",
    "the most efficient way a disc galaxy evolves is through forming a bar via disc instability which facilitates the redistribution of energy and angular momentum between the disc , dark matter halo and classical bulge @xcite .",
    "as the bar grows stronger , it goes through buckling instability and form boxy / peanut bulges ( hereafter , bp ) as demonstrated in numerous n - body simulation studies @xcite .",
    "bp bulges are seen in nearly @xmath1 of edge - on disc galaxies @xcite including our milky way and the line - of - sight ( los ) stellar and gas kinematics in many such barred edge - on galaxies show cylindrical rotation @xcite , as has also been noted in many n - body simulations of barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "stellar kinematics from the recently completed bulge radial velocity assay ( brava ) survey confirms the cylindrical rotation in the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "recent observational analyses , however , show deviations from cylindrical rotation in bp bulges , e.g. , ngc5746 , ngc1381 @xcite .",
    "deviations from cylindrical rotation is also reported in bp bulges of simulated galaxies due to variation in the viewing angles of the bar @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the projection effect is the correct interpretation , or whether a physical mechanism is required to explain the deviations from cylindrical rotation observed in bp bulges .",
    "bp bulges are not only formed out of pure axisymmetric discs but they can also form in axisymmetric discs assembled around classical bulges @xcite .",
    "such classical bulges are presumably have formed as a result of violent processes e.g. , dissipative collapse @xcite or mergers @xcite . in observation , one does find both barred and unbarred galaxies with classical bulges @xcite .",
    "classical bulges are indeed abundant in disc galaxies and they are known to rotate @xcite . in a previous paper , @xcite showed how an initially non - rotating low - mass classical bulge spun - up during the secular evolution and discussed the possible implication it might have on the final bp bulge .",

    "the goal of this paper is to understand the effect of angular momentum of a low - mass icb on the disc instability and kinematics of the final bp bulge .",
    "in particular , does the cylindrical rotation in bp bulges depend on the angular momentum of the icb and could this possibly explain the deviation from cylindrical rotation in observed bp bulges ?",
    "here , we study the formation and growth of a bar and bp bulge in galaxies with a low mass rotating icb using high resolution _ n_-body simulations .",

    "the icb in the constructed models has a total mass @xmath7 and the initial ellipticity in edge - on projection is @xmath8 .",
    "the rotating flattened models of icbs are constructed by reversing the velocities of particles with negative angular momenta , which remains a valid solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation @xcite . in this way , three models with rotating icbs which we denote as rcg004-a , rcg004-b and rcg004-c are constructed .",
    "their initial velocity contours are shown in section  [ sec : bkin ] .",

    "we address this issue in section  [ sec : cylin ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : veldisp ] , we show the variation of mean velocity dispersion ( @xmath69 ) of stars in the final bp bulge along the vertical direction at two different radii from the centre of the respective galaxy model . in all the models ,",
    "the minor axis @xmath69 profiles show steeper vertical gradient than the profiles at @xmath70 ( which is well within the bulge half - mass radii ) . a vertical gradient in the stellar velocity dispersion",
    "is observed in classical bulges as well as in boxy bulges @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that the velocity dispersion is remarkably constant along vertical direction in ngc4594 ( a classical bulge ) and in the well known boxy bulge of ngc4565 @xcite .",
    "so a gradient in the velocity dispersion does not necessarily indicate the nature of the underlying bulge .",
    "if measured in the boxy bulge region , one would perhaps expect a shallow gradient in the velocity dispersion . from fig .",
    "[ fig : veldisp ] , it is clear that the rotation of the low mass icbs does make little difference in the velocity dispersion of the final bp bulge .      by definition",
    ", cylindrical rotation means that the mean los velocity @xmath71 of stars at a particular distance ( @xmath41 ) from the centre is independent of its vertical height ( @xmath49 ) i.e. , zero vertical gradient ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this is approximately true for observed barred galaxies as well as for bulges in n - body simulations @xcite . here , we construct a simple criterion for measuring the degree of cylindrical rotation in bp bulges .",
    "we consider again a set of slits , nearly covering the vertical extent of the bp bulge , parallel to the major axis in edge - on projection . along these slits , we have the los surface density @xmath73 and velocity @xmath71 of stars . for a given slit placed at @xmath74 , we can compute the mass weighted line - of - sight velocity for all the stars within a projected distance @xmath75 from the minor axis of the edge - on image .",
    "this quantity may be normalized by replacing the individual velocities of all the stars within @xmath75 with a velocity at the bulge half - mass radius close to the disc midplane @xmath76 .",
    "after some experimenting , we adopt a weighting scheme and define a dimensionless quantity for the given slit as follows :    @xmath77    we compute this quantity for the set of slits considered .",
    "the adopted weighting scheme puts more weight on the data points further from the minor axis .",
    "note that , both the numerator and denominator have the dimension of angular momentum .",
    "if the stars close to the disc midplane rotate faster than the stars above , the denominator will always be greater than the numerator .",
    "if we had the knowledge of deprojection , one could interpret the above formulae as how the average rotational motion of stars associated with an infinitesimally thin disc at a vertical distance @xmath78 compares to the one close to the midplane .",
    "in general , the values of @xmath79 are @xmath29 near the midplane and decrease as @xmath49 increases",
    ".    to proceed further , we plot the computed @xmath79 values against the slit location ( @xmath49 ) above the galactic midplane .",
    "the velocities of stars decrease along the vertical direction in our model galaxies and the same is expected for galaxies in equilibrium .",
    "so we expect @xmath79 values can be well approximated by a linear function of @xmath49 , where @xmath49 is scaled to @xmath61 .",
    "we then fit a straight line to the ( @xmath79 , @xmath49 ) curve and derive the slope @xmath80 .",

    "<S> boxy / peanut bulges are believed to originate from galactic discs through secular processes . </S>",
    "<S> a little explored question is how this evolution would be modified if the initial disc was assembled around a preexisting classical bulge . </S>",
    "<S> previously we showed that a low - mass initial classical bulge ( icb ) , as might have been present in milky way - like galaxies , can spin up significantly by gaining angular momentum from a bar formed through disc instability . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how the disc instability and the kinematics of the final boxy / peanut ( bp ) bulge depend on the angular momentum of such a low - mass icb . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a strong bar forms and transfers angular momentum to the icb in all our models . </S>",
    "<S> however , rotation in the icb limits the emission of the bar s angular momentum , which in turn changes the size and growth of the bar , and of the bp bulge formed from the disc .    </S>",
    "<S> the final bp bulge in these models is a superposition of the bp bulge formed via the buckling instability and the spun - up icb . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the long - term kinematics of the composite bp bulges in our simulations is independent of the rotation of the icb , and is always described by cylindrical rotation . </S>",
    "<S> however , as a result of the co - evolution between bulge and bar , deviations from cylindrical rotation are seen during the early phases of secular evolution , and may correspond to similar deviations observed in some bulges . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a simple criterion to quantify deviations from pure cylindrical rotation , apply it to all our model bulges , and also illustrate its use for two galaxies : ngc7332 and ngc4570 .    </S>",
