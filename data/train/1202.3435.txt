    "@xcite later combined 6 new transits with previous data and found a periodic time variation of @xmath7 days , which could be interpreted as caused by a hypothetical second planet with a mass of @xmath115 m@xmath8 at a semimajor axis of 0.0507au and a period very close to the 2:1 mean motion resonance .",

    "the observation of wasp-3b was conducted in the @xmath11 band with the wirc instrument @xcite on palomar 200-in hale telescope on ut 2011 june 24 ( pi : hinkley ) .",
    "wirc has a 2048 @xmath12 2048 hawaii - ii hgcdte detector with a scale of 0.2487@xmath13/pixel and a wide field of view of @xmath14 .",
    "the observation started at 04:05:59.012 utc on 2011 june 24 , and ended 358.12 minutes later . to minimize instrument systematics",
    ", we stayed on the target without dithering for the entire observation .",
    "the telescope was defocused to a fwhm of about @xmath15 - @xmath16 to keep the counts well within the linearity regime and to mitigate intra - pixel variations .",
    "each image was taken with 12sec exposure and single fowler sampling .",
    "a total of 683 images were obtained .",
    "the duty cycle of the observation was 44% .",
    "because wirc does not have a dedicated guider , its guiding of targets relies completely on telescope tracking .",
    "a previous study has shown that the limited tracking precision of the telescope , especially along the x - axis ( i.e. , the direction of r.a . ) , results in highly correlated systematics in the detected light curves @xcite .",
    "these systematics are caused by inter - pixel variations of the detector ( due to imperfect flat fielding ) and is a dominant source of  red noise \" in high precision light curve measurements .",
    "stabilized guiding is necessary to partially mitigate this problem .",
    "we therefore designed an active guiding scheme to correct for the telescope tracking errors during observing based on the information obtained from previous images .",
    "the algorithm has been integrated into the wirc control system to offer fast corrections .",
    "figure [ centroid ] demonstrates the effectiveness of the new guiding scheme , which has improved the guiding precision of wirc by a factor of @xmath15 - 7 .",
    "currently , the precision is limited to @xmath12 - 3 pixels due to a highly periodic gear oscillation with a frequency of @xmath10.5hz from the telescope .",
    "we have been developing another algorithm to further correct this oscillation , and expect to deliver better guiding precision in future observations .",
    "the observation of wasp-3 was conducted during the development stage of the new guiding scheme .",
    "the guiding performance was similar to the middle panel of figure [ centroid ] , despite a loss of 45.43min of data due to a software glitch occurred during middle eclipse ( also see figure [ lc ] ) and a @xmath17-pixel centroid shift after the observation was recovered .      for the data reduction process , we first subtracted all images with corresponding averaged dark frames .",
    "twilight and sky flats were normalized and averaged to get a master flat field .",
    "a bad pixel mask was then created with the master flat and dark frames .",
    "the bad pixels in each image were interpolated with cubic splines based on adjacent flat - fielded pixels .",
    "wasp-3 is the brightest star in its relatively sparse field . to properly correct the highly correlated common - mode systematics in its light curve , six",
    "well separated and evenly distributed stars within the flux range of 0.13 to 0.71 times of that of wasp-3 were selected as references .",
    "other stars in the field were too faint to have sufficient signal - to - noise and were thus excluded .",
    "we calculated the centroids of all stars in each image using a center - of - mass calculation , since it provided the smallest scatters of their relative positions .",
    "the time series of wasp-3 s centroid was determined by averaging the relative positions of all reference stars after correcting for their relative distances .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on wasp-3 and the reference stars following the idl routines of daophot .",
    "the extracted fluxes of each star were normalized to the median of the time series .",
    "we used the median of the 6 reference time series as the final reference light curve due to the presence of outliers in the light curves of some reference stars and the fact that median is a more robust estimator .",
    "the final reference light curve is then used to normalize the flux of wasp-3 to correct for the common - mode systematics such as variations of atmospheric transmission , change of seeing and airmass , etc .",
    "we applied 48 different aperture sizes with a step of 0.5 pixel , and determined that an aperture with a radius of 16 pixels ( i.e. , a 32-pixel diameter ) gives the smallest out - of - eclipse and in - eclipse scatters for the normalized wasp-3 data ; this was taken as the final photometry aperture for all stars in every image .",
    "a sky annulus with 30-pixel inner radius and 35-pixel width was used for background estimation .",
    "the median value of the sky annulus was then used as the final sky background for subtraction .",

    "both the in - eclipse and out - of - eclipse data follow the gaussian expectation closely , although there are still some uncorrected systematics in the data .    to examine the statistical significance and robustness of the eclipse depth and to estimate its error , we conduct 2 statistical tests .",

    "this method maintains the time - correlated errors and is therefore another robust way of testing our fit .",
    "thanks to the minimal amount of  red noise \" in the data , the resulting distribution is also close to gaussian . the resulting median depth and 1-@xmath3 error is 0.185%@xmath20.019% , and the eclipse phase center is at 0.5044@xmath20.0015 , also consistent with the previous results .    we take the values from the lm best - fit and the largest error bars from the 3 different error analyses as our final results , and summarize them in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "based on the average flux of the target and the sky background , the expected photon noise precision for the eclipse data is 0.0065% .",

    "our measured flux ratio agrees with that of @xcite , 0.176%@xmath30 .",
    "however , it is too high to match models with heat redistribution . instead , the flux ratio is more consistent with a hot atmosphere in pure radiative equilibrium ( at the 2-@xmath3 level ) , with no redistribution across the surface of the planet .",
    "such a model has a nearly isothermal radial temperature profile across the near - ir photosphere over most of the dayside , except near the planet limb .",
    "the nightside is very cold .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with that of @xcite . perhaps coincidentally , the observed flux matches very closely the value predicted by a model for the substellar point ( top curve ) , suggesting that , at the @xmath0-band photospheric depth , the temperature is on average close to that at the substellar point ( also corresponding to a black body temperature of @xmath12435k ) .",
    "it is unrealistic for a planet s entire dayside to be as hot as the substellar point , indicating a large departure from radial temperature profile predicted by traditional one - dimensional atmosphere models .",

    "@xcite indicated that the observed radius of wasp-3b , 1.385@xmath38 , is more consistent with their full tidal evolution model .",
