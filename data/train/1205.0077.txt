    "we consider the anderson tight binding model , i.e. , a random schrdinger operator @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with the common distribution @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 with a constant @xmath7 .",
    "for a finite box @xmath8 , we denote by @xmath9 the operator @xmath10 restricted to @xmath11 with dirichlet boundary conditions . the integrated density of states ( ids for short ) , @xmath12 , is defined by @xmath13 here we denote the cardinality of a set @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "it is a consequence of ergodic theorem that for almost every @xmath16 the limit exists for all @xmath17 , where , the limit function @xmath18 is continuous , and is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "moreover @xmath19 a.e .",
    "the basic facts about the density of states is found in any of the standard books in the area for example cycon - froese - kirsch - simon @xcite , carmona - lacroix @xcite and figotin - pastur @xcite .",
    "it is a result of pastur @xcite and delyon - souillard @xcite that @xmath12 is always continuous .",
    "the ids @xmath20 is positive , non - decreasing and bounded ( by 1 ) function satisfying @xmath21 .",
    "so it is the distribution function of a probability measure . in the case when this measure is absolutely continuous , the density @xmath22 of this measure is called the  the density of states \" .",
    "one of the questions of interest is the degree of smoothness of the function @xmath22 , which is also often referred to as the smoothness of ids , which we do in the following .",
    "then our main result is stated as follows :    let @xmath23 be intervals , and suppose @xmath4 has an analytic density function @xmath24 on @xmath25 .",
    "then there is @xmath26 such that @xmath27 is analytic on @xmath28 if @xmath29 .",
    "our argument is so simple that we have good control of the constant .",
    "there are many results on the smoothness of ids for one - dimensional case .",
    "for example , @xmath12 is differentiable , even infinitely differentiable under some regularity assumptions on @xmath30 ( campanino - klein @xcite and simon - taylor @xcite ) .",
    "moreover the smoothness of ids in the anderson model on a strip are considered , for example , by klein - speis @xcite , klein - lacroix - speis @xcite , glaffig @xcite and klein - speis @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are very few results on the smoothness of ids for multi - dimensional case . using molchanov formula ( of expressing the matrix elements of @xmath31 in terms of a random walk on the lattice ) , carmona showed ( see section vi.3 @xcite ) that for the cauchy distribution the ids is @xmath32 .",
    "recently , veseli @xcite shows the lipschitz - continuity of ids for homogeneous gaussian random potentials using a wegner estimate .    among the most important other results in the multi - dimensional case",
    "are bovier - campanino - klein - perez @xcite , constantinescu - frhlich - spencer@xcite and bellissard - hislop @xcite and all the available results require that @xmath33 is small or the region of energy considered is away from the middle of the spectrum .",
    "we also consider the case with small @xmath33 , which corresponds to the large disorder case .",
    "a typical result in bovier - campanino - klein - perez @xcite is that @xmath34 is @xmath35-times continuously differentiable under the condition that the fourier transform @xmath36 of @xmath37 satisfies",
    "they also show that if @xmath36 decays exponentially , then @xmath39 has an analytic continuation to a strip , provided @xmath33 is sufficiently small . on the other hand constantinescu - frhlich - spencer @xcite",
    "shows that @xmath34 is real analytic in @xmath40 , for @xmath41 large enough if the density of @xmath30 is analytic in the strip @xmath42 for arbitrarily small , but positive @xmath43 .",
    "bellissard - hislop @xcite proves that if the distribution @xmath37 has a density analytic in a strip about the real axis , then these correlation functions are also analytic outside of the planes corresponding to coincident energies .",
    "in particular , their result implies the analyticity of @xmath22 , and of current - current correlation function outside of the diagonal .",
    "the paper @xcite employs taylor expansions to construct analytic continuation , whereas we use the cauchy theorem to show the existence of the analytic continuation .",
    "this elementary observation greatly simplifies the argument , and also extends the applicability .",
    "in particular , it makes the argument local in the energy variable , and thus we need the analyticity of the density function only locally .",
    "we prove theorem  1 in the next section . in section  3",
    ", we discuss an important example , i.e. , the uniform distribution case , and present explicit constants . section  4 is devoted to the discussion on correlation functions .",
    "we consider 2-correlation functions only , which are useful to study current - current correlation .",
    "the idea itself applies to higher correlation functions .",
    "let @xmath44 for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "we denote the @xmath47-entry of an operator @xmath48 on @xmath49 by @xmath50 .",
    "the following formula of the integrated density of states in terms of the spectral projectors is well - known : @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the projection valued spectral measure of @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath53 denotes the expectation with respect to the randomness ( see , e.g. , @xcite , remark  vi.1.5 ) . since @xmath54 is a numerical measure , the general theory of borel transforms ( see theorem 1.4.16 , corollary 1.4.11 of @xcite ) implies that the following limits exist almost every @xmath55 with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath56 and gives the density of the absolutely continuous part of @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath27 exists for each point in an interval and bounded , then the spectrum is absolutely continuous on the interval by the above formula .",
    "hence , in order to prove the analyticity of @xmath27 , it suffices to show that @xmath58 is analytic in a complex neighborhood of @xmath28 .",
    "we use the _ random walk expansion _ of resolvent to analyze @xmath58 .",
    "the random walk expansion is proposed by frhlich and spencer@xcite and used by constantinescu , frhlich and spencer@xcite for @xmath22 .",
    "we say @xmath59 is a _ path of length @xmath60 _ if @xmath61 for @xmath62 , and we write the initial point and the end point of @xmath63 as @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "we write the set of all paths of length @xmath60 with the initial point @xmath66 and the end point @xmath67 by @xmath68 .",
    "we note @xmath69 for any @xmath70 .",
    "we use the neumann series expansion of the resolvent : @xmath71 which converges if @xmath72 .",
    "it is easy to see , by expanding the summand on the right hand side and noting that @xmath5 connects only nearest neighbour sites and that the @xmath73 , @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "thus we learn @xmath76 we now consider @xmath77 for each @xmath78 .",
    "we denote @xmath79 . by the independence of the site potentials ,",
    "we can write @xmath80 we note @xmath81 except for finitely many @xmath82 and hence the product is a finite product .",
    "we also note @xmath83 for @xmath84 .    for @xmath85 , we set @xmath86 which is primarily defined for @xmath87 , where @xmath88 .      in the following ,",
    "we suppose @xmath90 , @xmath91 with some @xmath92 , and we write @xmath93 .",
    "we suppose @xmath4 has a density function @xmath24 on @xmath25 , and @xmath24 is extended to a complex function which is holomorphic in @xmath94 and continuous on @xmath95 .    under the assumptions above , @xmath89 is extended to a holomorphic function in @xmath96 . moreover , there is @xmath97 such that for any @xmath98 , @xmath99    let @xmath100 ( see figure 1 ) .    ,",
    "width=377 ]    then by the cauchy theorem , we learn @xmath101 from this representation , it is clear that @xmath89 is extended to @xmath96 as a holomorphic function .",
    "also , by setting @xmath102 we have the inequality since @xmath103 if @xmath104 and @xmath105 or @xmath106 .      by lemma  2 and",
    ", we now learn that @xmath107 is extended to a holomorphic function in @xmath108 , and it is bounded by @xmath109 on @xmath110 .",
    "we recall @xmath111 , and hence @xmath112 for @xmath104 if @xmath113 .",
    "thus by , under this condition , + @xmath114 is holomorphic in @xmath115 . in particular",
    ", we learn @xmath116 is holomorphic in @xmath115 , and we conclude theorem  1 thanks to .",
    "here we consider a typical anderson model , that is , the case when @xmath4 has the uniform distribution on @xmath117 $ ] with @xmath118 . in this case , it is well - known @xmath119 $ ] almost surely .",
    "we also note that it is known that the density of states @xmath27 exists and it is smooth if @xmath33 is sufficiently small ( @xcite , corollary  1.3 )",
    ".    since @xmath4 has the density @xmath120 on @xmath121 , we can apply theorem  1 to conclude that for any @xmath122 , @xmath27 is analytic on @xmath123 if @xmath33 is sufficiently small .",
    "however , in this case , we can explicitly compute @xmath89 to obtain a sharper result .",

    "here we extend our method to show the analyticity of correlation functions ( see bellissard - hislop @xcite ) .",
    "for simplicity , we consider 2-correlation functions only , which apply to current - current correlation functions .",
