    "currently the search for gravitational radiation from astrophysical sources is carried out with the first - generation earth - based laser interferometers ( ligo in usa @xcite , virgo in italy @xcite , geo-600 in germany @xcite , tama-300 in japan @xcite and aciga in australia @xcite ) .",
    "the development of the second - generation gw detectors ( advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , geo - hf @xcite and lcgt @xcite ) is well underway .",
    "the sensitivity of the first - generation detectors is limited by noises sources of various nature : seismic and suspension thermal noise at low frequencies ( below @xmath0 hz ) , thermal noise in suspensions , bulks and coatings of the mirrors ( @xmath1 hz ) , photon shot noise ( above @xmath2 hz ) .",
    "it is expected that the sensitivity of the second - generation detectors will be ultimately limited by the noise of quantum nature arising due to heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite over most of the frequency range of interest .",
    "the optimum between measurement noise ( photon shot noise ) and back - action noise ( radiation pressure noise ) is called the standard quantum limit ( sql ) this level is expected to be reached in the forthcoming second generation of large - scale laser - interferometric gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "third generation detectors , such as the einstein telescope @xcite aim to significantly surpass the sql over a wide frequency range @xcite .    the most promising methods to overcome the sql rely on the implementation of optical ( ponderomotive ) rigidity @xcite which effectively turns the test masses of a gravitational - wave detector into harmonic oscillators producing gain in sensitivity @xcite .",
    "a single optical spring always causes instability .",
    "the instability ( negative damping for mechanical degree of freedom ) can be compensated by incorporating a linear feedback control loop and in the ideal case ( no additional noise is introduced by the feedback ) it would not modify the noise spectrum of a gw detector @xcite . in practice , however , the need for control gain at frequencies inside the detection band can cause undesirable complexity in the control system or can introduce additional classical noise .",
    "an alternative way to suppress the instability was proposed @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite , by injecting a second carrier field from the bright port ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : advligo ] ) in order to create a relatively small additional negative rigidity component , thus leaving the total rigidity ( of both lasers together ) positive , but at the same time to introduce a relatively large additional positive damping component to make total damping positive .",
    "the main purpose of the second carrier is to create a second optical spring that forms a stable optical spring together with the first one  even though each individual optical spring , acting alone , would be unstable .",
    "both carriers are assumed to have different polarizations ( or carriers frequencies to differ from each other by large enough value ) , so that there is no direct coupling between the two pump field ( although they both directly couple to the mirrors ) .",
    "a simple criterion for the stability of an optical spring and its application to the double resonance regime was presented in @xcite .",
    "it allows to use attractive regimes of double resonance @xcite or negative inertia @xcite in stable variants with no need to use feedback loops .    in this paper",
    "we further analyze the sensitivity of advanced ligo ( aligo ) interferometer with a double pump using approach @xcite . to obtain more wide sensitivity curve we use the regime of _ three _ close roots of characteristic equation instead of double resonance regime",
    ". however this regime demands smaller interferometer relaxation rates , close to limit caused by optical losses , so there is need to consider optical losses too .",
    "analysis shows that presence of losses does nt affect the sensitivity curves much .",
    "finally we apply this regime to the parameters of einstein telescope @xcite and show that use of stable double optical spring makes possible to make an improvement to sensitivity in small frequency range .",
    "we consider the balanced interferometer similar to aligo configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : advligo ] ) pumped by two lasers .",
    "we assume that vacuum fluctuations input through dark port ( no squeezing ) , fabry - perot cavities in arms are identical and have no optical losses .",
    "the masses of input and end mirrors in arms are equal to @xmath3 .",
    "the mean frequencies of each pump @xmath4 are equal to one of the eigen frequencies of each cavity . here and below subscripts",
    "@xmath5 refer to main and auxiliary pumps .",
    "we also introduce the notations :      here @xmath7 is the distance between the mirrors in arms ( @xmath8  km for aligo ) , @xmath9 is the distance ( several meters ) between sr mirror and the input mirrors in fabry - perot cavities , due to strong inequality @xmath10 we assume that @xmath11 do not depend on @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that arm cavities are tuned in resonance , @xmath13 is the relaxation rate of single fabry - perot cavity in arm , @xmath14 is amplitude transmittance of input mirrors in arms , @xmath15 is amplitude reflectivity of sr mirror , @xmath16 are the detunings introduced by displacement shift of sr mirror , @xmath17 is the relaxation rates of the differential mode of the interferometer for each pump .",
    "it is worth underlying that detunings @xmath16 and relaxation rates @xmath17 may be different for each pump .",
    "we start from equations for output quadratures amplitudes @xmath18 expressed in terms of input quadratures amplitudes @xmath19 in frequency domain ( superscripts @xmath20 refer to different quadratures , see details and notations in appendix  [ notations ] )      here @xmath22 is susceptibility of mechanical degree of freedom accounting optical rigidities @xmath23 introduced by pumps 1 and 2 , @xmath24 are mean powers circulating in arms ( pumped by main and auxiliary lasers ) , @xmath25 is reduced mass , @xmath12 is spectral frequency , @xmath26 is dimensionless gravitational metric perturbation normalized by sql perturbation @xmath27 .",
    "the term @xmath28 in formulas ( [ starteq ] ) describes fluctuational ( back action ) and signal forces , while the first terms in right parts describe measurement errors .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 are the following :    [ ut ] @xmath30 , \\\\ u_3   & \\equiv -\\sqrt{\\mathcal{q}_2}\\theta_2\\,\\delta_2,\\quad       u_4 \\equiv \\sqrt{\\mathcal{q}_2}\\theta_2\\left[\\gamma_2-i\\omega\\right ] ,    \\\\ t_1 & \\equiv \\sqrt{\\mathcal{q}_1}\\theta_1^ *          \\left[\\gamma_1+i\\omega\\right],\\quad      t_2 \\equiv \\sqrt{\\mathcal{q}_1}\\theta_1^*\\,\\delta_1,\\\\ t_3 & \\equiv \\sqrt{\\mathcal{q}_2}\\theta_2^ *          \\left[\\gamma_2+i\\omega\\right],\\quad      t_4 \\equiv \\sqrt{\\mathcal{q}_2}\\theta_2^*\\,\\delta_2\\,,\\\\ \\mathcal{q}_{1,2 } &   \\equiv    \\frac{2\\gamma_{1,2}|k_{1,2}|}{\\delta_{1,2}\\,\\mu\\omega^2}\\times      \\frac{1}{\\big| ( \\gamma_{1,2}-i\\omega)^2+\\delta_{1,2}^2\\big|},\\\\       \\theta_{1,2 } & \\equiv \\sqrt       \\frac{(\\gamma_{1,2}+i\\omega)^2+\\delta_{1,2}^2}{(\\gamma_{1,2}-i\\omega)^2+\\delta_{1,2}^2}\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]              from equations ( [ starteq ] ) we see that if susceptibility is large enough ( @xmath35 ) the back action force prevails over measurement errors and mainly defines sensitivity and spectral density @xmath36 of noise recalculated to dimensionless metric @xmath26 is ( see eq .",
    "[ f ] ) : @xmath37+\\\\   & \\qquad + \\frac{\\gamma_2\\,|k_2|}{\\delta_2\\,\\mu\\omega^2 } \\left [      \\frac{|\\gamma_2+i\\omega|^2 + \\delta_2 ^ 2}{\\big| ( \\gamma_{2}-i\\omega)^2+\\delta_{2}^2\\big| }      \\right]\\ , .",
    "\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is obvious to assume that close to resonance ( when @xmath35 ) we have approximation : @xmath38 .",
    "hence , from ( [ shk1 ] ) one may conclude that this term will be less than unity ( i.e. sensitivity is better than sql , @xmath39 ) in case of small optical relaxation rates , i.e. @xmath40 if rigidity @xmath41 introduced by main pump is larger than @xmath42 we should keep in mind that first inequality ( @xmath43 ) in ( [ cond1 ] ) is more important than second one ( @xmath44 ) ."
