    "neutron star low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) were believed to behavior similarly to the black hole lmxbs ( lin et al . 2007 ) .",
    "they spend most of the time in quiescence , and occasionally show an outburst with accretion rate dramatically increased . during the outburst",
    ", the neutron star lmxbs will evolve at the similar track of the state transition as black hole lmxbs do , basically from a low / hard state to a high / soft state ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "the optical emission of lmxbs was often contributed to thermal emission of the companion star and outer accretion disk , and sometimes synchrotron emission of a jet .",
    "the disk can be heated by mainly two physical processes , one is the friction between adjacent layers of the disk when the materials were accreted ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , the other is the x - ray irradiation from the inner disk ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) . with the evolution of disk structure and other physical properties , the radiation mechanism of the optical flux will vary , which will be different for neutron star lmxbs and black hole lmxbs .    for black hole lmxbs ,",
    "the synchrotron emission of a jet was believed to dominate the optical emission during low / hard state , with possible disk - reprocessed emission ( russell et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the soft state ,",
    "all the near - infrared and some of the optical emissions are suppressed , a behavior indicative of the jet switching off in transition to the soft state ( russell et al .",
    "the viscously heated disk emission may become the dominant source .",
    "the multi - wavelength observation of gx 339 - 4 provided a perfect example to demonstrate the trend : a good correlation among the fluxes from the x - ray power - law component , the radio , and the optical was found during low / hard state which suggests the jet emission , however , the optical flux dramatically decreased when the source entered high / soft state .",
    "meanwhile , an @xmath3 two - week x - ray flux delay was found during high / soft state which indicates a viscously heated disk emission .    for neutron star lmxbs ,",
    "the jet emission is not important unless at very high luminosity .",
    "x - ray reprocessing was believed to dominate the optical emission at low / hard state , with possible contribution from viscously heated disk ( russell et al .",
    "the long - time observation of neutron star lmxb , e.g. aquila x-1 hr ) and therefore a very large disk .",
    "usually transient nss have orbital periods in the 2 - 8 hr range .",
    "however , the quasi - simultaneous optical and x - ray luminosity of aquila x-1 follows the general relation for neutron star lmxbs ( russell et al .",
    "2006 ) ] , shows that neither the optical / near - infrared color nor its brightness change sharply during an x - ray spectral state transition .",
    "so it is believed that for aquila x-1 the outer accretion disk is not affected by x - ray spectral state transitions ( maitra & bailyn 2008 ) , the x - ray reprocessing was thought to contribute most of optical emission at both the low / hard and high / soft state .",
    "when the optical emission is dominated by the viscously - heated - disk emission , the emission at each radius provides a measure of the instantaneous local accretion rate at the given radius .",
    "the x - ray and optical emission , respectively , map the mass flow through the inner and outer disk",
    ". continuous monitoring to both the x - ray and optical emission allows us to track the temporal evolution of the system .",
    "the cross - correlation of the x - ray and optical light curves helps to map the accretion flow direction , the x - ray / optical time delay reflects the viscous timescale of the disk ( e.g. homan et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the time lag between the initial point of the outburst in x - ray and optical emission was believed to be able to , to some extent , test the disk model and the trigger mechanism of the outburst ( narayan et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "sax j1810.8 - 2609 is a soft x - ray transient ( sxt ) discovered on 10 march 1998 with the wide field cameras ( 2 - 28 kev ) onboard the _ bepposax _ satellite ( ubertini et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it was identified as a neutron star lmxb because a strong type - i x - ray burst was detected ( natalucci et al .",

    "it showed a hard x - ray spectrum with emission up to 200 kev . the broadband spectrum ( 0.1 - 200 kev )",
    "can be described by two components : a soft black body component with the temperature @xmath4 0.5 kev , and a power - law component with the photon index @xmath5 ( natalucci et al . 2000 ) .    from 1998 through 2007 ,",
    "sax j1810.8 - 2609 had been in a quiescent state .",
    "the neutron star system in quiescence was also detected by _",
    "chandra _ on 16th august 2003 ( jonker et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it had an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath310@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 over the energy range of 0.3 - 10 kev , given the distance of 4.9 kpc .",
    "it shows that the quiescent spectrum could be well fitted by the two models : neutron star atmosphere + power - law model and black body + power - law model .    in august 2007 , _",
    "swift _ detected a new phase of highly luminous activity ( parson et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the luminosity varies between ( 1.1 - 2.6 ) @xmath8 erg s@xmath7 during this outburst . considering the time interval of the recurrence , the observed outburst luminosity corresponds to a low time - averaged accretion rate of @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 ( fiocchi et al .",
    "the x - ray spectra had shown the evolution during different epochs of the outburst , but a significant power - law component was always present ( fiocchi et al .",
    "it is noted that the source never reached the high soft state during the outburst .    in this paper , we obtained the twelve - year optical light curve of sax j1810.8 - 2609 , which covers two outbursts .",
    "we cross - correlated the optical light curve with the x - ray light curve from the _ rxte_/asm and _ swift_/bat archive .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and data calibration . in section 3",
    "we identify the optical counterpart and analyze the temporal morphology of the outburst . in section 4",
    "we show the results of the cross correlation and discuss their implications .",
    "section 5 is the summary .",
    "the region containing sax j1810.8 - 2609 has been regularly observed by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) project during eleven observing seasons from 1997 to 2009 , including the outbursts in 1998 march and 2007 august .",
    "the ogle data were collected using a dedicated 1.3 m warsaw telescope located at las campanas observatory , chile , and operated by the carnegie institution of washington . during the years of 1996 - 2000",
    "ogle used a single 2048@xmath122048 ccd chip ( with a pixed size of 0.417 ) operating in the drift - scan mode ( ogle - ii ; udalski et al .",
    "1997 ) . for ogle - iii ( 2001 - 2009 )",
    "the camera was upgraded to a mosaic of eight @xmath13 ccd chips with pixel size of 0.26(udalski 2003 ) . during ogle - ii and ogle - iii , for the bulge fields",
    "each observation was exposed for 120 seconds .",
    "the observations were usually done in the i - band .",
    "datasets from both phases of ogle were processed using the same photometric package based on difference image analysis ( dia ; wozniak 2000 ) .",
    "the method requires creation of a template / reference image , composed of the best available images of a given field . the template is then convolved with the psf of an image to be analyzed and the subtraction is performed , revealing residuals due to changes in the objects fluxes , or to the appearance of new objects .",
    "the flux residuals are then measured with aperture photometry , and light curves are created ( udalski 2008 ) .    in templates for both ogle - ii and ogle - iii we found a faint star with a constant @xmath14 mag , 0.44away from the outburst position as shown in figure 2 . because there was no object at the outburst position on the templates , all the residual flux from the outbursts",
    "was attributed to this faint star .",
    "therefore the composite light curve , shown in figure 1 , contains both the baseline fluxes from the template object and outbursts , and the faint template object contributes a negligible amount of emission during outbursts .",
    "this source is labeled in the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) microlensing alert catalogue as moa_2007_bul_365(bond et al .",
    "moa was also operating in the i - band . in quiescence , this source is also well below the detection threshold of moa .",
    "it was monitored during the 2007 outburst .",
    "we calibrated the moa light curve using the quasi - simultaneous ogle light curve .",
    "the all sky monitor ( asm ) ( 2 - 12 kev ) onboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) has provided the longest continuous coverage of luminous x - ray sources ( levine et al .",
    "in its quiescent state , sax j1810.8 - 2609 was not detected by the asm , but the asm detected and monitored both outbursts .",
    "the second outburst was also monitored by _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xmath315 - 50 kev ) through the hard x - ray transient monitor program ( barthelmy et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we retrieved both data sets from their respective websites .",
    "in addition , _",
    "integral_/ibis ( 22 - 68 kev ) also detected this source during this outburst ( fiocchi et al .",
    "2009 ) , however , we did not include the _ integral _ data because the monitoring was not frequent enough near peak .",
    "in the optical band , the outburst is located in ogle iii field blg251.8 with the coordinates ( r.a=18@xmath1510@xmath1644@xmath17.47 , dec.=-26@xmath1809@xmath1901@xmath20.7 ) .",
    "this position is consistent with the position of sax j1810.8 - 2609 ( r.a.=18@xmath1510@xmath1644@xmath17.47 , dec.=-26@xmath1809@xmath1901@xmath20.2 ) determined by _",
    "( jonker et al 2004 ) , with an uncertainty of 0.6 .",
    "it is also consistent with the optical counterpart position of ( r.a.=18@xmath1510@xmath2144@xmath22.4 dec.=-26@xmath1809@xmath1900@xmath20 ) with an uncertainty of 1determined by greiner et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "the non - detection by moa and ogle constrains the source to be fainter than 21 mag in i band during quiescence ( figure 2 ) .    in the optical light curve ,",
    "we indicate the 1998 outburst with light blue ` @xmath23 ' and the 2007 outburst with dark blue ` @xmath24 ' ( see figure 1 ) . it is noted that the light blue points are concentrated on the decay phase in 1998 outburst because the main part was not observed .",
    "the optical observations were usually done in the i - band , however , one observation in r band were also available .",
    "we can use the magnitude difference between i and r bands to estimate the disk temperature in the outer region .",
    "the r - band observation is r=@xmath25 on march 13th 1998 ( greiner et al .",
    "1998 ) , and two ogle i - band observations closest in time are : i=@xmath26 mag on march 10 and i=@xmath27 mag on march 16 , respectively .",
    "so we take the average for the two i - band detections , and use it as the proxy for the i - band magnitude on march 13th .",
    "therefore , we have r - i@xmath28 mag . once we make the reduction correction ( sumi 2004 ) , it is r - i@xmath29 mag , and it corresponds to a temperature @xmath30 k with a black body model , which is consistent with the typical temperature for the outer disk .",
    "the 2007 august outburst was well monitored , and the whole optical and x - ray light curves are shown in figure 3 . the hard ( 15 - 50 kev ) and soft ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray data are from _ swift_/bat and _ rxte_/asm , respectively .",
    "the moa and ogle data were combined together to form the optical light curve .",
    "the similarity of the optical and the x - ray light curve during 2007 outburst confirms the identification of the optical counterpart .",
    "we did not use the _ integral_/ibis ( 22 - 68 kev ) light curve because of the incomplete covering .    in figure 1",
    ", we notice that the fluxes at four occasions ( which are all out of the outburst phase ) were significantly higher than the baseline .",
    "it is certain that three of these are not likely to be real because the other stars in the field also exhibited the similar flux feature during these observations .",
    "it means that these flux measurements were affected by the systematic uncertainties that may be related to weather , sky background , or instrumental effects .",
    "the fourth point with an elevated flux at mjd = 52583.5 is indicated with a red circle .",
    "we do nt have any direct evidence to show this point is also affected , but the quality of the image makes it difficult for us to conclude that the system was experiencing a true increase in optical flux . if the flux increase is true , this data point is pretty interesting , and it may represent an short - duration ( no longer than 2 days ) outburst .",
    "we checked all the dwell data of the corresponding _",
    "rxte_/asm observations and found no x - ray detection .",
    "this single flux increase may imply a magnetic loop reconnection in the outer disk as proposed by zurita et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "the 2007 august outburst showed a multi - peak morphology ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "we divided the whole outburst light curve into three parts : ( 1 ) an initial rise ( @xmath31 mjd @xmath32 ) , where the outburst is detected in optical but not in x - ray ; ( 2 ) the first peak ( @xmath33 mjd @xmath34 ) ; and ( 3 ) the rebrightening stage ( @xmath35 mjd @xmath36 ) , which includes all the subsequent peaks . the temporal behavior in the optical and x - ray bands is very similar .",
    "the solid lines in figure 3 is used to separate these three different stages .",
    "the position of significant optical peaks / dips were indicated with dotted lines .",
    "the corresponding x - ray peaks / dips usually follow the optical peaks / dips but with a - few - days lag .",
    "the first optical peak occurred at @xmath37 , while the corresponding x - ray flux peaked slightly later .",
    "the optical light curve has a significant dip when it tends to get a second peak at @xmath38 , then a sudden rise roughly three days later .",
    "the dip was followed by the x - ray light curve about two days later .",
    "the third significant optical peak occurred at @xmath39 , and was followed by both the soft and hard x - ray light curve a few days later .",
    "the optical light curve also has a wide peak near @xmath40 which is very similar to that in the hard x - ray light curve ; the optical emission still leads the x - ray emission .",
    "the source was not detected by _",
    "rxte_/asm until the flux reached the level of @xmath41 mcrab on mjd 54323 ( levine et al .",
    "1996 ) , but the optical emission was detected as early as on mjd @xmath42 . during the initial rise phase ,",
    "the optical detection ( ogle and moa ) was earlier than the x - ray detection ( _ rxte_/asm ) by @xmath43 days .",
    "similar x - ray delays were found in quasi - simultaneous x - ray and optical monitoring of sxt gro j1655 - 40 ( orosz et al . 1997 ) , xte j1550 - 564 ( jain et al . 2001 ) , 4u 1543 - 47 ( buxton & bailyn 2004 ) and aquila x-1 ( shahbaz et al . 1998 ; maitra & bailyn 2008 ) , among which the initial point of outburst in x - rays lagged in optical by @xmath44 days .",
    "the x - ray delays at the initial rise reflect the timescale of the thin disk , which determines the time it takes for the accretion flow to arrive at the inner region where the x - ray emission comes from .",
    "it already takes into account the timescale by the material to fill in the _ advection - dominated accretion flow _ ( adaf ) region , which can extend to large radius in quiescent state ( e.g. narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "for all the systems aforementioned , the initial x - ray rises of the outbursts were all determined by linear extrapolations of the _ rxte_/asm light curve .",
    "we notice , however , that the detection threshold for _ rxte_/asm is much higher than the flux of the source in quiescence state .",
    "the x - ray flux might have increased by a factor of a few tens before detected .",
    "furthermore , the flux may actually increased in a way much slower than linear increase before detected by _",
    "rxte_/asm , the initial point found by linear extrapolation may be actually much later than the actual starting point ( homan et al . 2005 ) . here",
    "we apply a power - law extrapolation to the x - ray / optical data points during the rise phase of the outburst as shown in figure 4 .",
    "it would make a big difference if the flux increased exponentially rather than linearly .",
    "the x - ray luminosity was calculated with a distance of 4.9 kpc ( natalucci et al .",
    "2000 ) . based on _ chandra _ observations ,",
    "its quiescent luminosity is @xmath45  erg  s@xmath7 ( jonker et al .",
    "figure 4 shows an extrapolation that indicates that optical flux may have begun to rise at mjd @xmath46 with @xmath47 magnitude in quiescence .",
    "the fit to the x - ray data has large uncertainty , it gave an x - ray initial rise at at mjd @xmath48 .",
    "the start points of optical and x - ray flux are consistent with each other within one - sigma error .",
    "it is significantly different from the start points directly detected .",
    "we can not conclude x - rays delay at the start of the outburst due to the limited data .",
    "we conducted cross - correlations of the optical and x - ray emission for the first peak and the rebrightening phases , respectively . during the first peak ,",
    "we only cross - correlated the soft x - ray ( _ rxte _ , 2 - 12 kev ) and optical light curves .",
    "however , during the rebrightening stage , we cross - correlated optical and soft x - ray , optical and hard x - ray ( _ swift _ , 15 - 50 kev ) , soft and hard x - ray emission , respectively .    for the convenience of performing the cross - correlation , we did a linear interpolation to each light curve with a time interval of 0.1 days .",
    "the cross - correlation between two interpolated light curves gave out a _",
    "cross correlation factor _ ( ccf ) function with uniform time lags .",
    "the factor ccf will tell us how strong the correlation is , and it is defined as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the data series with finite length , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the averages of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the variance of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "one caveat is that the value of ccf may not be zero even if the two data series are not correlated at all , e.g. , if the data series are short , the noise may produce a non - zero ccf .",
    "we therefore conducted a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation to create faked x - ray and optical light curves using the same temporal interval and uncertainty of each data point from the observed ones . in order to make sure",
    "the faked light curves have no correlation , we assume each value on the faked light curves is taken from a gaussian distribution ( its central value is set zero , and @xmath58 of the distribution is set to be same as the observed uncertainty at each epoch ) .",
    "therefore , the faked light curves generated in this way are like the pure noise .",
    "once one set of faked light curves are generated , we did a linear interpolation and cross - correlated the interpolated light curves , obtaining the time lag and the maximum ccf . by repeating this process for 2000 times for the first peak phase and the rebrightening phase , respectively , we computed the distribution of the maximum values of ccf , and then derived the @xmath59 confidence level of ccf of each phase .",
    "the @xmath59 confidence level for the cross - correlation for the first peak is ccf@xmath60 , which is plotted in figure 5 , and for the rebrightening phase it is ccf@xmath61 as plotted in figure 6 .    any correlation with ccf above the limit value is likely to be due to the real signal .",
    "we employed the area centroid of the ccf function above the limit value to derive the time lag ( koen .",
    "the uncertainty of time lag was obtained by applying a mc simulation described above , with considering the light curve uncertainties , to compute the distribution of time lags .",
    "all the uncertainties in our results are given but the @xmath62 level of confidence .    during the first peak ( figure 5 ) , the soft x - ray and optical emission are positively correlated with maximum ccf of 0.85 , which has a 5.0 @xmath58 level of confidence . the soft x - ray lags optical emission by 0.60@xmath630.30 days . during the rebrightening stage ( figure 6 ) ,",
    "the soft and hard x - ray emission are correlated with maximum ccf of 0.61 ( 4.3@xmath58 level of confidence ) , they vary simultaneously with no obvious lag ( time lag = @xmath64 days ) . the soft x - ray and optical emission are weakly correlated with maximum ccf of 0.54 ( 3.5@xmath58 level of confidence ) , soft x - ray lags optical emission by 2.10 @xmath63 0.28 days . the hard x - ray and optical emission are correlated with maximum ccf of 0.61(4.3@xmath58 level of confidence ) , hard x - ray lags optical emission by @xmath65 days .",

    "2006 ) . the disk can be also heated by the x - ray and ultraviolet ( uv ) emission from the inner disk . in this case , @xmath69 was taken for optical emission from x - ray reprocessing ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) , where @xmath70 is the orbital separation .",
    "the flat optically - thick spectrum of the jets of neutron star can also be extented to the optical regime , we adopted the relation @xmath71 ( migliari & fender 2006 ) for this process .",

    "only the upper limit of x - ray luminosity was available which gave no tight constraint .",

    "each component contributes a large portion of the optical light .",
    "the x - ray delay becomes significant , reaching to @xmath1 days at the rebrightening stage , which suggests that viscously - heated - disk emission becomes dominant .",
    "the prevail of viscously - heated - disk emission should result from two sides : first , as the luminosity ratio of the optical to the x - ray becomes slightly higher at rebrightening stage , there should be an enhancement of radiation efficiency of viscously heated disk .",
    "it was believed the outburst will have a rebrighteing stage if the disk was only partly irradiated , part of the disk was in shadow at the first peak ( truss et al .",
    "the first peak is caused by the accretion of gas within the irradiation portion of the disc , while the subsequent peaks are caused by the accretion of the gas in the outer disk , until the whole disk is kept in high - viscosity state .",
    "it is natural that the radiation area of the disk at rebrightening stage will be larger , and the temperature may be higher .",
    "second , the x - ray reprocessing emission should be suppressed .",
    "it was affected by the structure of both the x - ray source and the outer disk , if the x - ray source is elevated above the disk or the outer disk is warped , it will have high reprocessing efficiency .",
    "when the x - ray source becomes aligned with the disk plane , the reprocessing efficiency will decrease . here",
    "the change of x - ray delay between the first peak and rebrightening stage is significant , the source should evolve outer disk ( maybe also inner disk ) variation during the outburst .",
    "the @xmath1 days x - ray delay during rebrightening stage properly reflects the timescale of the disk during hard state .",
    "it also reflects the outside - in disk accretion process , as we discuss in the outburst morphology section , the variation of x - ray flux follows the optical properly . compared to the @xmath78 days x - ray / optical delay of gx 339 - 4 during rebrightening stage when the source has entered soft state , the @xmath1 days x - ray delay is short .",
    "sax j1810.8 - 2609 should has a very small accretion disk .",
    "in addition , the source stayed in hard state during rebrightening , it should distribute some time to fill the adaf region within the @xmath79 days . an extremely small disk and small companion star",
    "are expected , which is actually what people expected for a faint sxt",

    "they correspond to m@xmath82 and m@xmath83 with d = 4.9 kpc ( natalucci et al .",
    "2000 ) , respectively .",

    "the x - ray reprocessing emission usually dominates the optical flux of the neutron star lmxb at low / hard state ( russell et al .",
