    "the abelian sandpile model ( asm ) , introduced by bak , tang , and wiesenfeld , is the original prototype for self - organized criticality  @xcite .",
    "systems with self - organized criticality are naturally driven to a critical point , and thus can potentially explain how power laws occur in nature without any fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "since their introduction , sandpile models have been used to model an extraordinarily wide range of systems , from earthquakes  @xcite to river networks  @xcite ; see  @xcite for reviews .    to be precise",
    ", we are considering the two - dimensional isotropic abelian sandpile model .",
    "this is a very simple model ; in fact , its simplicity is its strength , since otherwise it could not act as a model for such a diverse range of physical systems .",
    "the asm is defined on a square lattice , where each site has a height variable ( the number of grains of sand at that site ) that can range from 1 to 4 . at each time step , a grain of sand is added to a random site .",
    "any site with more than four grains is unstable , and collapses , losing four grains , and sending one grain to each of its neighbors .",
    "unstable sites are repeatedly collapsed until all sites are stable .",
    "then , a new time step begins  a grain is added to a random site , and the process begins anew  @xcite .",
    "initially , probabilities of configurations will depend on the initial conditions , but after a long period of time , the asm develops a well - defined probability distribution of states , independent of the initial conditions  @xcite . typically , the number of grains is conserved in each toppling , except for sites along open boundaries , where grains are lost with each toppling ( i.e. fall off the edge ) .",
    "there must be at least one dissipative site  i.e .",
    "at least one site where the number of grains decreases upon toppling  or else the sandpile would eventually reach a state where topplings continued endlessly during a single time step .    despite its simplicity ,",
    "certain basic properties of the asm remain unknown .",
    "for example , despite intensive work , the power law governing the sizes of avalanches in the asm is still unknown  see  @xcite for a review . and",
    "while the height one variable is well understood , the roles played by the higher height variables ( two , three , and four ) are not . for example , no bulk two - point correlation functions of higher height variables are known .",
    "it is known that the asm is related to the set of spanning trees that can be drawn on the sandpile lattice , and that this relationship can be used to perform exact calculations of asm probabilities  @xcite .",
    "a spanning tree is a set of arrows drawn on the lattice , such that each site has exactly one arrow pointing from the site to a neighbor , and such that there are no closed loops of arrows .",
    "following the path of arrows from any site will eventually lead off the edge of the sandpile ( or , more generally , to a dissipative site , such as found on an open boundary)the `` site '' off the edge of the sandpile is called the root .",
    "a number of relationships between the asm and spanning tree states are known . for example , the number of recurrent states of the asm ( states that occur with nonzero probability after a long amount of time ) is equal to the number of spanning trees that can be drawn on the sandpile lattice  @xcite .",
    "spanning trees are , in turn , related to the @xmath1 conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "the @xmath1 cft is the simplest known example of a logarithmic conformal field theory ( lcft ) , and is well understood  @xcite .",
    "a method introduced by majumdar and dhar exploits the mapping between asm states and spanning tree states to obtain exact asm probabilities  @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that the majumdar - dhar method can be used to find the two - point correlation function of the unit height variable , which decays as @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "more recently , mahieu and ruelle used the majumdar - dhar method to calculate correlation functions of a number of asm height configurations , known as weakly allowed cluster variables  @xcite .",
    "they not only found that all the correlations decayed as @xmath2 , but were able to use their correlations to identify the thirteen simplest weakly allowed cluster variables with operators in the lcft .",
    "these variables were all identified with linear combinations of three lcft field operators , all of which had scaling dimension two , but only one of which ",
    "the @xmath3 operator  was isotropic . in some ways , this suggested that the higher height variables should be identified with @xmath3 ; on the other hand , mahieu and ruelle pointed out that this appeared inconsistent with lcft operator product expansions ( ope s ) .",
    "despite the power of these mappings , and of the majumdar - dhar method , fundamental questions about the asm remain unanswered , because aspects of the mapping between the asm and @xmath1 lcft are still unknown  for example , it is not known what field operators in the @xmath1 lcft represent the higher height variables of the asm ( or , indeed , whether such a representation even exists ) .",
    "a single site with height two , or any higher height variable , is not a weakly allowed cluster , and thus higher height probabilities and correlations can not be calculated with the majumdar - dhar method .",
    "priezzhev was able to extend the majumdar - dhar method to calculate the bulk probabilites for all higher height variables  @xcite . however , the bulk correlations of the higher height variables , which would be needed to obtain the field identifications of the higher height variables , remain unknown .",
    "ivashkevich calculated all two - point correlation functions of all height variables , along open and closed boundaries  @xcite .",
    "he found that all boundary correlations , between all height variables , decayed as @xmath2 , and argued that this implied that all four height variables should be represented by the same field operator ( up to rescaling ) .",
    "dhar has argued that , based on clustering properties of correlation functions , the bulk correlations should be expected to factorize in a manner consistent with giving all four height variables the same field identification  @xcite .",
    "however , we argue here that the four height variables should in fact receive different field identifications , both along closed boundaries , and in the bulk , and propose field identifications along closed boundaries .",
    "our conclusions are based on analysis of closed boundary three - point functions , and of dissipative defect sites , as well as a reanalysis of the methods and results of ivashkevich .",
    "however , we show that along open boundaries all four height variables , as well as dissipative defect sites , are represented by the same operator , @xmath4 , in the @xmath1 lcft .",
    "we demonstrate this by computing all @xmath0-point correlations of height variables and dissipative defects .    in sections  [ sec : green.formalism ] and",
    "[ sec : height.probabilities ] we briefly review the methods used by majumdar , dhar , and priezzhev for studying the asm . in section  [ sec : ivashkevich.review ] , we review ivashkevich s calculations of the boundary height probabilities .    in section  [ sec : closed.loop.calculation ] , and appendices  [ sec : complication1 ] and  [ sec : complication2 ] , we discuss issues associated with boundary correlation functions . while ivashkevich has already calculated the boundary two - point correlations  @xcite , we show that he mischaracterized the mapping between asm configurations and spanning tree configurations , and a correct characterization results in a number of complications , necessitating a reanalysis of the two - point correlations .",
    "the relationship between asm states and spanning tree states is not what one might have initially expected ; we also note that linear relationships between nonlocal spanning tree conditions and local spanning tree conditions for one - point probabilities do not carry over in a simple fashion for multipoint correlation functions .",
    "both of these complications introduce what we call `` anomalous graphs''while these complications are important , because they are technical in nature , we delegate much of the discussion to the appendices . in section  [ sec : closed.loop.calculation ] we calculate the anomalous graphs , and conjecture that the anomalous graphs have no effect on the universal parts of any boundary correlation functions ; while we have not been able to prove this conjecture , it holds true for all correlation functions that we have calculated .    in section  [ sec : three.point.closed ] , we look at correlation functions along closed boundaries . for two - point correlation functions , we find that while we disagree with ivashkevich s relationship between asm and spanning tree states , we agree with his final results .",
    "however , we argue that these final results are , in fact , not consistent with identifying all height variables with the same field operator .",
    "next , we calculate all three - point functions along closed boundaries that involve at least one unit height variable , and use these to make field identifications along closed boundaries . selected three - point functions appear in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f111]-[eq : f122 ] ) , and we state the field identifications in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : height.one.identification]-[eq : height.three.identification ] ) .    next , in section  [ sec : dissipation.general ]",
    ", we introduce the concept of a dissipative defect site , and discuss its effect on the lattice green functions for the open , closed , and bulk cases . in section  [ sec : dissipation.closed ] , we show that in the closed and bulk cases , dissipative defects have no effects on _ any _ weakly allowed cluster variables .",
    "this demonstrates that an analysis of weakly allowed cluster variables , such as that in  @xcite , can not provide a complete picture of the asm .",
    "our results imply , as a particular case , that dissipative defects in the closed and bulk cases have no effect on the unit height probability , or on correlations of unit heights .",
    "they do , however , have an effect on the higher height variables ; we show this analytically for the closed case , in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : defect2]-[eq : defect3 ] ) , and have checked this numerically for the bulk case .    in sections  [ sec : all.open.correlations.complications ] , [ sec : all.open.correlations.answer ] , and [ sec : all.open.correlations.dissipation ] , we compute all @xmath0-point correlation functions , for any number of height variables , and with any number of dissipative defects , along open boundaries . we find that there , all four height variables , and dissipative defects , are all represented by the same dimension two field , @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , all local arrow diagrams along open boundaries are represented by @xmath4 , up to multiplicative prefactors .",
    "a short summary of these results can be found at  @xcite .",
    "at its core , the asm is a tractable model because the sandpile model has an abelian structure ; the state of the sandpile does not depend on the order in which grains are added to the sites  @xcite . as a result of this abelian structure",
    ", it can be shown that the states of the sandpile fall into two simple categories .",
    "some of the @xmath5 states of the sandpile ( where @xmath6 is the number of sites ) are transient , which means that they can occur early in the asm s evolution , but occur with zero probability after an infinitely long time .",
    "the other states are recurrent , and all occur with equal probability after long times .",
    "so the probability for a property x to occur is nothing more than the fraction of recurrent states having property x.    to analyze the sandpile , it is convenient to allow more general toppling rules .",
    "we characterize the sandpile by a toppling matrix , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are any lattice sites . @xmath8",
    "topples if its height is ever greater than @xmath10 , at which point its height goes down by @xmath10 , and the height of every other site @xmath9 goes up by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 if @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not neighbors ) .",
    "the original asm , described in the introduction , has @xmath13 when @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 when @xmath14 is along a closed boundary ) , @xmath16 when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are nearest neighbors , and @xmath12 otherwise .",
    "dhar was able to show that the number of recurrent states , given very general restrictions on @xmath17 , is equal to @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath19 is also known to be equal to the number of spanning trees that can be drawn on the lattice  @xcite . in the spanning tree representation",
    ", @xmath10 indicates the number of neighbors that the arrow from @xmath8 can point to , @xmath16 if an arrow can point from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , and @xmath12 otherwise .",
    "certain height probabilities in the asm can be equated with probabilities for spanning trees to have particular arrow configurations .",
    "probabilities for _ some _ arrow configurations can be computed simply by modfiying the toppling matrix from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , in a way that enforces that arrow configuration .",
    "then , the number of spanning trees with the configuration is @xmath22 , and the probability of the configuration is @xmath23 . defining @xmath24 ,",
    "the probability becomes    @xmath25    @xmath26 is the well - known lattice green function  @xcite ( see appendix  [ sec : green.functions ] ) . if @xmath27 only differs from @xmath20 in a finite number of entries , then @xmath28 is finite - dimensional , and the probability can be easily computed .",
    "majumdar and dhar used this method to find the probability for a site @xmath8 to have unit height  @xcite . to do this , they defined a modified , or `` cut '' asm , in which three of the four bonds connecting @xmath8 to nearest neighbors are removed . when a bond is removed , the maximum height of sites on each end is decreased by one ;",
    "so the three sites adjacent to @xmath8 get maximum heights of 3 , and @xmath8 gets a maximum height of 4 - 3=1 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that recurrent states @xmath29 ( of the original asm ) where @xmath8 has height one are in one - to - one correspondence with the recurrent states @xmath30 of the cut asm . in this correspondence",
    ", we map from @xmath29 to @xmath30 by lowering the heights of each of the three sites cut off from @xmath8 by one . letting @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ,",
    "be the three the neighbors that @xmath8 has been cut off from , we have    @xmath34    then the unit height probability is @xmath35 .",
    "this method was also used by majumdar and dhar to calculate the two - point correlation of the unit height variable  @xcite .",
    "priezzhev extended the majumdar - dhar method to allow for the calculation of diagrams with closed loops . with the basic majumdar - dhar method ,",
    "all off - diagonal entries of the toppling matrix are either 0 or -1 .",
    "priezzhev proved that if in @xmath27 we set @xmath0 off - diagonal entries of @xmath20 to @xmath36 , then    @xmath37    is equal to the number of arrow configurations such that each of the @xmath0 corresponding arrows is in a closed loop of arrows , where each closed loop contributes a factor of @xmath38 , and there are no closed loops other than those going through these @xmath0 bonds .",
    "such configurations are not spanning trees ; spanning trees can not have any closed loops .",
    "however , priezzhev found that to calculate certain spanning tree probabilities , he needed to calculate graphs that had closed loops ( @xmath39-graphs ) .",
    "we find this method useful for the calculation of certain closed boundary correlations .",
    "priezzhev determined a relationship between higher height probabilities and spanning tree states , which we review here  @xcite .",
    "central to our analysis is the concept of forbidden subconfigurations ( fscs ) .",
    "a forbidden subconfiguration is a subset @xmath40 of the lattice , such that for all @xmath41 , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the height of site @xmath8 , and @xmath44 is number of neighbors that @xmath8 has in @xmath40 .",
    "majumdar and dhar proved that a state of the asm is recurrent if and only if it has no fsc s  @xcite .",
    "the probability for a site @xmath8 to have height two is more complicated than the height one probability  @xcite . in this case , changing the site height to one could either leave the asm in an allowed ( recurrent ) state , or produce an fsc .",
    "the first case just gives the height one probability , which has already been calculated , so we consider the second case . changing",
    "the height of @xmath8 from two to one can produce multiple fsc s .",
    "let @xmath40 be the maximal forbidden subconfiguration ( mfsc ) produced by this change .",
    "( because more than one fsc can be produced , the word `` maximal '' is necessary for complete precision , and for this mapping to work ; priezzhev simply referred to `` the '' fsc , but this does not introduce any errors in his analysis  @xcite . ) @xmath40 must contain @xmath8 , and exactly one of the neighbors of @xmath8 , and be simply connected , but can otherwise have arbitrary shape .",
    "the states @xmath29 of the original asm where changing the height of @xmath8 from two to one produces @xmath40 as the mfsc are in one - to - one correspondence with states @xmath30 of a modified asm . in the modified asm ,",
    "all the bonds bordering @xmath40 are removed , except for one ( arbitrarily chosen ) bond of @xmath8 . in the correspondence",
    ", we map from @xmath29 to @xmath30 by lowering heights of all sites that border @xmath40 by the number of neighbors of @xmath40 that they have been cut off from .",
    "( in this mapping , heights in @xmath40 are unaffected . ) with this mapping , the state @xmath29 has no fsc s in the original asm if and only if the state @xmath30 has no fsc s in the cut asm .",
    "( priezzhev s explanation used a slightly different , but equivalent , argument , based on the burning algorithm , a method for determining if a state is recurrent  @xcite ) .",
    "the site @xmath8 is called a predecessor of the site @xmath9 in the spanning tree if the path from @xmath8 to the root goes through @xmath9 .",
    "we define @xmath45 , as the number of nearest - neighbors of @xmath8 that are predecessors of @xmath8 .",
    "then , the correspondence above shows that the number of states of the modified asm is equal to the number of spanning trees of the modified lattice , which is in turn equal to the number of spanning trees where @xmath40 is the set of predecessors of @xmath8 .",
    "summing over all possible sets @xmath40 , we simply obtain the number of spanning trees where @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , it can be shown that the number of asm states allowed when @xmath8 has height @xmath47 ( or greater ) but forbidden when @xmath8 has height @xmath48 ( or less ) , is equal to the number of spanning trees where @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the probability @xmath50 for the site to have exactly height @xmath47 in the asm is    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the probability that a randomly chosen spanning tree will have @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the maximum possible height of @xmath8 .",
    "( @xmath55 in the bulk , and along open boundaries , while @xmath56 along closed boundaries . ) for more details , see  @xcite .",
    "this gives an exact representation of asm height probabilities in terms of spanning tree probabilities .",
    "however , these spanning tree probabilities are not easy to calculate . spanning tree probabilities that correspond to local restrictions on the spanning tree",
    "can be calculated with the majumdar - dhar method . however , the statement that @xmath53 is a _ nonlocal _ restriction on the spanning tree ( for @xmath57 ) .",
    "priezzhev was able to calculate these nonlocal probabilities , but his calculations were complicated , and do not appear to be easily extensible to calculation of bulk correlations . however , this problem turns out to be more tractable along a boundary .",
    "for sites at the boundary , the relationship between height probabilities and @xmath58 s still holds , and the @xmath58 condition is still nonlocal .",
    "nevertheless , ivashkevich was able to show , through an ingenious transformation , that the asm height probabilities are much easier to calculate along boundaries  @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nonlocallist ] we list all possible nonlocal arrow configurations around a site @xmath8 of a closed boundary . in each picture , the dashed line is the boundary , and the central site is @xmath8 .",
    "large , solid , circles are predecessors of @xmath8 , while large , open , circles are not .",
    "we see explicitly that the predecessor relationships are nonlocal . @xmath59 and",
    "@xmath60 differ only in whether the site above @xmath8 leads to @xmath8 by a chain of arrows  since the chain of arrows can go through sites distant from @xmath8 , this is a nonlocal distinction .",
    "if we can figure out the probabilities of all these diagrams , we can figure out the nnp probabilities ( and thus the height probabilities ) .",
    "for example , the probability for @xmath46 is simply @xmath61 , since these diagrams catalogue all the ways that @xmath8 can have exactly one nnp .",
    "these nonlocal diagrams are difficult to calculate . on the other hand ,",
    "local restrictions are easily calculated with the majumdar - dhar method .",
    "all local arrow diagrams along closed boundaries are shown in figure  [ fig : locallist ] .",
    "note that these diagrams do not have solid or open circles , because predecessor relationships are not specified in local diagrams .",
    "ivashkevich pointed out that the local arrow diagrams could be written as linear combinations of nonlocal arrow diagrams .",
    "for example , looking at figures  [ fig : nonlocallist ] and  [ fig : locallist ] , we see that @xmath62 . at first sight , there are more nonlocal arrow diagrams than local arrow diagrams , so such linear relationships would not appear to let us solve for the nonlocal arrow diagrams .",
    "however , ivashkevich also pointed out that certain nonlocal arrow diagrams are equal in probability  for example , @xmath60 and @xmath63 are equal in probability , because we can make a one - to - one mapping from @xmath60 to @xmath63 by reversing all arrows in the long path of @xmath60 , and then switching the incoming arrow to @xmath8 . similarly , @xmath64 .",
    "then , we have as many nonlocal diagrams as local diagrams , and can solve for the nonlocal arrow diagrams .",
    "( in fact , along open boundaries , the number of local diagrams is one greater than the number of nonlocal arrow diagrams , so that the system is overconstrained , providing a check on the calculations . )",
    "ivashkevich used this to calculate all height probabilities along open and closed boundaries .",
    "see  @xcite for the full list of linear relationships between local and nonlocal diagrams .",
    "the calculation of boundary correlations is much more difficult . we show in appendix  [ sec : complication1 ]",
    "that ivashkevich s calculation of the two - point functions was incorrect , and ignored complications that arise in the relationship between asm height correlations and spanning tree correlations ( although his end result turns out to be correct ) . in appendix",
    "[ sec : complication2 ] , we discuss further complications that arise in transforming from nonlocal spanning tree correlations to local spanning tree correlations . we summarize the results here , and analyze the resulting `` anomalous graphs '' .",
    "the first complication arises in the correspondence between asm height probabilities and spanning tree probabilities .",
    "it would be natural to think that , analogously to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal.to.height.one ] ) , the asm probability , @xmath65 , for the sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 to have exactly heights @xmath43 and @xmath66 should be given by    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the probability that in a spanning tree , @xmath53 and @xmath69 .",
    "however , this turns out to not be quite the case .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal.to.height.two ] ) is a natural guess , which we call a `` naive '' approach , but as shown in appendix  [ sec : complication1 ] , the left and right sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal.to.height.two ] ) differ by a subset of spanning trees that we call anomalous graphs of the first kind .",
    "( these graphs are not anomalous in any physical sense ; we simply mean that they differ from what we would get , using a certain naive starting point . )",
    "the set of anomalous graphs of the first kind , for the closed case , is shown in figure  [ fig : anomalousgraphc ] .",
    "( we represent the root with a star . ) in the graph , @xmath70 , so this graph appears in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal.to.height.two ] ) for @xmath71 .",
    "however , we show in appendix  [ sec : complication1 ] that this graph does not contribute to the 2 - 2 ( height two - height two ) correlation , but instead contributes to the 2 - 3 and 3 - 2 correlations , and gets subtracted from the 3 - 3 correlation .",
    "second , leaving aside for now the anomalous graphs of the first kind , we need to calculate correlations of nonlocal arrow diagrams",
    ". it would be convenient if we could use the linear relationships relating nonlocal arrow diagrams to local arrow diagrams found for one - point functions ( section  [ sec : ivashkevich.review ] ) , and use them _ independently _ at @xmath8 and at @xmath9 for two - point functions .",
    "we again call this approach `` naive , '' and again , this approach does not quite work . the problem arises because for one - point functions , we treated @xmath60 and @xmath63 as equivalent , based on a one - to - one correspondence in which a long path was reversed . in a correlation function of nonlocal arrow diagrams ,",
    "the long path from a @xmath60 at @xmath8 may go through arrow constraints near @xmath9 , which are not free to be reversed .",
    "we discuss this problem in detail in appendix  [ sec : complication2 ] .",
    "consideration of this problem shows that , relative to the naive approach , our results are changed by graphs @xmath72 and @xmath73 , shown in figure  [ fig : anomalousgraphsab ] .",
    "we call these anomalous graphs of the second kind .",
    "the anomalous graphs @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 can be calculated with the extension of the method of priezzhev , discussed in section  [ sec : green.formalism ]  @xcite .",
    "we discuss only the calculation of the @xmath73 term ; the analysis of the other terms is similar .",
    "@xmath73 represents a subset of spanning trees , and thus can not have any closed loops .",
    "however , it comes `` very close '' to having a closed loop that includes the distant sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and we see in figure  [ fig : b.closed.loops ] that @xmath73 can be written as a sum of closed loop diagrams .    priezzhev s method allows us to calculate the closed loop diagrams .",
    "we represent an arrow whose weight in @xmath20 is set to @xmath36 ( @xmath75 ) with a wavy bond line . as discussed in section  [ sec : green.formalism ] , these bonds must be part of a closed loop , and we get a factor of @xmath38 for every closed loop .",
    "this gives the relations in figure  [ fig : closed.loops.general ] .",
    "taking the difference of the two graphs in figure  [ fig : closed.loops.general ] then gives the value of a closed loop diagrams that goes through both @xmath8 and @xmath9 . using this method",
    ", we find the number of diagrams @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ( labeled in figure  [ fig : b.closed.loops ] ) , as ratios of @xmath6 , the total number of spanning trees :    @xmath79    @xmath80 is the separation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 along the defect .",
    "@xmath81 is the green function between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and diverges as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the system size ( it also diverges as @xmath84 ) .",
    "the restriction that spanning trees should have no closed loops greatly limits the number of possible spanning trees , when the outlets to the root ( open boundaries ) are very far away .",
    "so diagrams such as @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , that allow a closed loop , are much more numerous than diagrams of spanning trees .",
    "however , to find @xmath73 , we take the linear combination , @xmath85 , and the @xmath86 divergences cancel ( this provides a check on our calculations ) . @xmath72 and @xmath74 can be found similarly .",
    "we find    @xmath87    @xmath72 and @xmath73 are both of order @xmath88 .",
    "the two - point correlation functions turn out to decay as @xmath88 , so the anomalous graphs could , in principle , affect the universal parts of the correlation functions .",
    "however , the anomalous graphs of the second kind come in the combination @xmath89 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ab.contribution.1]-[eq : ab.contribution.3 ] ) ) .",
    "so their total contributions to the two - point correlations are @xmath90 , and can be dropped .",
    "the end result is rather surprising .",
    "a `` naive '' approach might simply apply the relationship between asm states and nnp conditions found for the one - point functions , independently at @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( i.e. extend eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal.to.height.one ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal.to.height.two ] ) ) , and then apply the relationships between nonlocal arrow diagrams and local arrow diagrams found for the one - point functions , independently at @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "neither of these steps is correct , and a correct analysis produces correction terms ( the anomalous graphs ) to this naive approach .",
    "but , somehow , the anomalous graphs , while nonzero , produce no correction to the leading - order , universal results at any stage of the computation ; the naive approach gives the answers .",
    "in fact , we find in the following sections that the naive approach again gives correct results for all three - point closed boundary correlations that we have calculated , and for all open boundary correlations .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that the naive approach always produces correct universal results , for all correlations .",
    "if this conjecture were proven true , it would greatly simplify further calculations  for example , the anomalous diagrams have prevented us from calculating the 2 - 2 - 2 correlation along closed boundaries .",
    "we define , for all correlation functions along closed boundaries ,    @xmath91    in this correlation function , the height @xmath92 at the boundary site @xmath93 is required to be @xmath94 .",

    "instead of having bulk sites topple when their height is greater than 4 , they topple when their height is greater than @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "then , one grain is sent to each of the four neighbors , and @xmath111 grains are lost to the root .",

    "nevertheless , the defect behaves very differently in the open case , and in the closed / bulk cases .",

    "these results provide further evidence that the height two and three variables have different field identifications along closed boundaries .",
    "since the height two and three variables have dimension two , this indicates that a dissipative defect along a closed boundary is a dimension zero operator .",

    "mahieu and ruelle pointed out that since the height two variable appears in a number of the weakly allowed cluster variables , it might be expected that the height two variable would also be a linear combination of these three fields , or more specifically , proportional to the sole rotationally invariant field , @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "but they also noted that such an identification appeared inconsistent with the fusion rules of the @xmath1 cft , which would indicate a different field identification .",
    "the analysis here points strongly to the latter conclusion , although the specific field identification in the bulk remains unresolved .",
    "we have calculated all @xmath0-point correlations of all four height variables , along open boundaries , in the presence of an arbitrary number of dissipative defects .",
    "we begin by discussing why this case is so tractable ( in contrast to the closed case , where we have been unable to calculate the three - point function of the height two variable ) .",
    "the heights of the correlation function are placed at @xmath136 , and defining @xmath137 , we work in the limit @xmath138 , where the @xmath139 s are kept constant .    as discussed in section  [ sec : closed.loop.calculation ] , and appendices  [ sec : complication1 ] and  [ sec : complication2 ] , a number of anomalous terms arise in the computation of correlation functions . while the discussion in these sections focused on closed boundary correlations , similar anomalous graphs arise in open boundary correlations .",
    "however , it turns out that these anomalous graphs produce no contributions to the universal parts of any correlation functions , greatly simplifying matters .",
    "we prove this claim in this section , and in the next section look at the actual calculation of the correlation functions .",

    "the paths do not actually form closed loops , since no closed loops are allowed in spanning trees , but they do come very close ( within one site ) .",
    "the reasons for this are general , so similar structures will arise in all anomalous graphs , for all correlation functions .",
    "for example , the anomalous graphs in figure  [ fig : anomalousgraphsab ] arose because a long , nearly - closed loop from one site could not be reversed in direction , if it passed through fixed arrows at the other site ( see figure  [ fig : phi1.phi2.complications ] of appendix  [ sec : complication2 ] ) .    in the open case",

    "necessarily involves two green functions , one from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , and another from @xmath9 to @xmath8 , giving an overall factor of @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , calculating the diagrams requires two matrix determinants , which come with leading terms equal in magnitude , but opposite in sign  see figure  [ fig : closed.loops.general ] .",
    "the @xmath140 parts of the closed loop diagrams thus cancel along open boundaries .",
    "so the anomalous graphs for the two - point functions automatically fall off faster than @xmath140 , and do not need to be considered when calculating leading - order , universal parts of correlation functions .    by this logic , for any @xmath0-point open boundary correlations , any anomalous graphs must have terms that decay as @xmath142 , where @xmath143 , for some @xmath144 . aside from the sites at @xmath145 and @xmath146 , there are @xmath147 other sites that need to appear in the connected correlation function .",
    "each brings a new green function , of @xmath148 , so the overall contribution of any anomalous graph must decay at least as fast as @xmath149 .",
    "but we will see in the next section that all @xmath0-point correlations decay to leading order as @xmath150 .",

    "the conjecture at the end of section  [ sec : closed.loop.calculation ] has thus been proven for all open boundary correlations .",

    "the defects have exactly the same effect as the height variables  each trip to ( or from ) a defect results in a @xmath141 term from the green function to ( or from ) the defect ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : g.open.leading ] ) ) .",
    "so , in the end , the correlation function of @xmath0 height variables on the boundary and @xmath218 defect sites near or on the boundary , is given by the @xmath237 dimensional matrix determinant , @xmath202 ( with appropriate normalization factors ) .",
    "this shows that dissipative defect sites along or near open boundaries are , like the height variables , represented by @xmath4 .",
    "note that a dissipative defect has a much larger effect along a closed boundary than along an open one .",
    "a defect is represented by a dimension zero operator along a closed boundary , but by a dimension two operator along an open boundary .",
    "this makes sense ; along open boundaries , grains are already dissipated by topplings , so adding a little more dissipation has only minor effects , compared to dissipation on a closed boundary .",
    "in this section we discuss what we call anomalous graphs of the first kind , which arise when converting from asm height probabilities to spanning tree probabilities . as stated in section  [ sec : closed.loop.calculation ] , it would be natural to expect , based on analogy with the one - point height probabilities , for the two - point height probabilities to be given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal.to.height.two ] ) . however , this turns out to not be the case .",
    "let us carefully consider how height correlations can be turned into spanning tree probabilities .",
    "we focus on the closed two - point correlations ; other cases are similar .    for correlations between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , ivashkevich divided the states of the asm into sets @xmath238 , consisting of states allowed when @xmath239 and @xmath240 , but forbidden otherwise  @xcite . however , not all asm states fall into one of these sets . there are states that are allowed when @xmath241 , and when @xmath242 , but forbidden when @xmath243 ; these states do not belong to any set @xmath238 .",
    "one such state is shown in figure  [ fig : fsc.complications ] .",
    "we find it convenient to define @xmath244 , consisting of asm height configurations on the sandpile , _ excluding _ @xmath8 and @xmath9 , that are allowed when we add @xmath245 , but both forbidden when we add @xmath246 , and also forbidden when we add @xmath247 .",
    "note that when counting states , the fact that we do not specify the heights of @xmath8 and @xmath9 introduces a multiplicative factor ; for example , @xmath248 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 both on a closed boundary . now , every state must be in at least one of the sets @xmath244 , but some states are in several @xmath244 s .",
    "for example , the state in figure  [ fig : fsc.complications ] is in both @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "no anomalous graphs arise for two - point correlations involving at least one unit height variable , since in those cases the relevant @xmath251-sets do not intersect .",
    "the number of states where @xmath8 has height one and @xmath9 has height @xmath47 is @xmath252 .",
    "furthermore , the representation of @xmath253 is exactly what we would expect ; it corresponds to the number of spanning trees where @xmath254 , and @xmath255 .",
    "so no anomalous graphs arise when the two - point correlation has at least one unit height variable .",
    "things get more complicated when both heights are higher heights .",
    "we discuss in detail the 2 - 2 ( height two - height two ) correlation along a closed boundary ; the analysis for the other two - point correlations is similar .",
    "if @xmath8 and @xmath9 both have height two , we must be in at least one @xmath244 , for @xmath256 , @xmath257 .",
    "@xmath249 and @xmath250 intersect , so number of 2 - 2 states is    @xmath258    the first three terms all have the `` natural '' spanning tree representation .",
    "the difficulty is in evaluating @xmath259 .",
    "@xmath260 counts states where @xmath261 is allowed , but neither @xmath241 nor @xmath242 are allowed . in figure",
    "[ fig : venn.diagram ] , we have started with a large rectangle , representing the the set of states where @xmath261 is allowed , and @xmath243 is forbidden  we call this set @xmath262 . in the rectangle are two subsets , corresponding to regions where @xmath241 is allowed , and where @xmath242 is allowed  we call these two sets @xmath263 and @xmath264 . in this venn diagram , @xmath260 is the diagonally shaded region outside the circles , and @xmath265 is the cross - hatched intersection of the two circles .",
    "looking at the venn diagram , we see that to find @xmath259 , we start with the set @xmath262 , and then subtract off the states in @xmath263 and @xmath264 _ independently_. by independently we mean that states in the intersection of @xmath263 and @xmath264 get subtracted off twice .",
    "so    @xmath266    for states in @xmath262 , setting @xmath243 produces an mfsc .",
    "( note that we have defined the mfsc as the maximal fsc produced when the heights at both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are simultaneously set to one ; if only one height was set to one , then the largest fsc might be smaller , or there might be no fsc at all . ) the set @xmath262 can be partitioned into the following disjoint subsets , depending on the shape of the mfsc :    @xmath267    @xmath263 and @xmath264 can be partitioned into analogously defined subsets , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , etc . .",
    "so , for example , @xmath270 is the subset of @xmath271 such that @xmath241 is allowed .",
    "( note that @xmath272 and @xmath273 . )",
    "we want    @xmath274    our `` naive '' guess would be that this would equal the set of states where @xmath70 .",
    "we carefully count the states , comparing with this guess .",
    "@xmath275 , after subtracting off the states from @xmath268 and @xmath276 , is equal to one - fourth the number of spanning trees for which @xmath8 and @xmath9 each have one @xmath58 , and @xmath277 does not border or intersect @xmath278 .",
    "( the one - fourth comes from the fact that the spanning tree arrows from @xmath8 and @xmath9 can point out from the mfsc in any direction . )",
    "@xmath279 refers to the set of sites that are predecessors of @xmath280 .",
    "the condition that @xmath281 and @xmath278 can not border each other comes from the condition that the mfsc consist of disjoint subsets around @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we now consider @xmath282 .",
    "the mfsc generated when @xmath243 must still be an mfsc when @xmath242 .",
    "so @xmath283 produces an mfsc that includes exactly one neighbor of @xmath9 , the site @xmath8 , and at least two of @xmath8 s neighbors .",
    "just as in section  [ sec : height.probabilities ] , this is equivalent to a modified asm , where bonds along the border of the mfsc are removed ( except for one bond of @xmath9 ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : x.decomposition ] ) , @xmath273 , but we do need to subtract off states in @xmath269 .",
    "to do this we only count the states of @xmath282 such that @xmath241 is forbidden , which implies that @xmath284 should produce a new , smaller fsc , completely contained within the larger mfsc .",
    "we then see that @xmath285 corresponds to one - fourth of all spanning trees where @xmath70 , and either @xmath286 or @xmath8 borders @xmath287 , _ with one exception_. the exception occurs because the mfsc , by construction of @xmath282 , can only have one neighbor of @xmath9 .",
    "so @xmath288 will not count cases where @xmath289 , @xmath8 borders @xmath287 , and @xmath9 borders @xmath279this case is shown in figure  [ fig : anomalousgraphc ] .",
    "we label this set of graphs as @xmath74 .",
    "since @xmath74 has @xmath70 , it would be natural to expect it to appear in the spanning trees contributing to the height two - height two correlation function .",
    "however , since no mfsc s of @xmath262 have two neighbors of @xmath8 and two neighbors of @xmath9 , graph @xmath74 does not appear in @xmath290 or @xmath271 either .",
    "the analysis for @xmath290 is identical to that for @xmath282 , and @xmath291 counts one - fourth the spanning trees where @xmath70 , and either @xmath292 or @xmath9 borders @xmath279 , except that , again , the spanning trees of @xmath74 are excluded .    in @xmath271 ,",
    "the mfsc has only one neighbor of @xmath8 and one neighbor of @xmath9 .",
    "the one - to - one mapping between @xmath271 and spanning tree states posessess some subtleties , but the end result is what one would expect : the number of states in @xmath293 is one - fourth the number of spanning trees where @xmath70 , and @xmath279 and @xmath287 border each other , but @xmath294 , and @xmath295 .    in the end , we see that @xmath296 is equal to the number of spanning trees where @xmath70 , except for the set @xmath74 , which contains all spanning trees where both @xmath8 borders @xmath287 , and @xmath9 borders @xmath279 .",
    "@xmath74 consists of the anomalous graphs of the first kind .",
    "an similar analysis for other closed correlation functions shows that the spanning trees in @xmath74 contribute to the height two - height three correlation , and get subtracted from the height three - height correlation ( relative to a `` naive '' approach ) .",
    "these changes are necessary for the height probabilities to all sum to one , so this provides a check on our mapping between asm states and spanning tree states . in the next appendix , we consider yet another complication that arises in the calculation of the two - point functions .",
    "we saw in the previous appendix that eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal.to.height.two ] ) does not quite hold , but is only off by the anomalous graph @xmath74 . so except for this complication , the two - point height correlations can be turned into linear combinations of probabilities for spanning trees with nonlocal conditions on @xmath45 and @xmath297 . as in the previous appendix , we discuss only the closed boundary two - point functions ; other cases are similar .    as discussed in section  [ sec : ivashkevich.review ] , we can write the probability @xmath298 to have @xmath49 as a linear combination of nonlocal arrow diagrams , which we can then rewrite as follows ( see figures  [ fig : nonlocallist ] and  [ fig : locallist ] ) :    @xmath299    these relationships hold regardless of the correlation functions that @xmath8 are in . we define operators corresponding to the _ local _ parts of these terms :    @xmath300    in one - point functions , @xmath64 , and @xmath301 , so @xmath302 and @xmath303 simply become @xmath304 and @xmath305 , which are local , and whose expectation values can be found with the majumdar - dhar method , as discussed in section  [ sec : ivashkevich.review ] .",

    ", we call this approach `` naive,''this naive approach does not quite work , and we call the deviations of the correct answers from the naive approach `` anomalous graphs of the second kind . ''    we no longer have @xmath64 and @xmath301 in correlations of @xmath302 and @xmath303 , because in correlations between distant sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 , switching arrows at @xmath8 can affect predecessor relationships at @xmath9 . to analyze the @xmath306 terms in eqs .",
