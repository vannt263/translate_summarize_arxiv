    "generation and manipulation of spin - polarized carriers in semiconductor structures solely by electric methods is a key problem of spintronics  @xcite .",
    "one of widely studied approaches to attain this goal is based on using spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "the soi is known to produce the spin polarization of electron current in layered tunnel structures .",
    "the effect is caused by the rashaba soi at the barrier boundaries of asymmetric structures  @xcite or by the dresselhause soi in the barrier bulk  @xcite .",
    "a general property of such structures is the absence of the spin polarization in the case where the current is directed normally to the barrier . in other words , a current component along a barrier should be created to get a spin current .",
    "this limits the capability of these structures to generate spin currents .",
    "recently it has been found that two - dimensional ( 2d ) structures with a lateral barrier are free of this restriction  @xcite .",
    "the electron current passing through the barrier acquires spin polarization , which exceeds 50% even if the current is directed normally to the barrier .",
    "however , in the studied case the soi exists only inside the barrier .",
    "such structures seem to be hardly realizable , since it is problematic to localize the rashba soi within the lateral barrier , especially if the latter is created by gate electrodes .    in the present work the research of ref .",
    "@xcite is generalized to the case when soi exists everywhere : in the potential barrier and the surrounding electron gas .",
    "we find that the high spin polarization can also be achieved in such structures .",
    "however , in this case two important questions arise concerning the definition of the spin current and the existence of equilibrium spin currents in 2d electron gas with soi  @xcite .",
    "they provoked recently a wide discussion  @xcite . as regards the existence of equilibrium spin currents , this question is not essential for the barrier structures considered here for the following reason .",
    "the equilibrium spin current is known to be generated only within a narrow energy layer @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is electron energy , @xmath2 is a characteristic energy of soi  @xcite . if the barrier height @xmath3 considerably exceeds @xmath2 the barrier transparency for electrons in this energy layer is negligibly small .",
    "the problem of the spin current definition can be overcome by calculating an observable physical quantity , which is well defined and closely related to the spin flow in soi medium .",
    "this could be a spin current in a normal 2d electron gas ( without soi ) , which is brought to the contact with the soi structure under consideration .",
    "in other words , it is reasonable to explore a structure in which the spin current generated in the soi region passes into a normal region where spin current is unambiguously defined .",
    "one can say that this region is designed to simulate , at least partially , a measuring process .",
    "with this in mind we study the spin current transformation when electrons pass through a contact between soi and normal 2d regions , and find conditions under which this transformation occurs practically without loss of spin polarization .",
    "finally we have found , that the barrier in the 2d electron system with the soi allows one to generate the electron current with spin polarization exceeding 50% and this spin current can be transferred into a normal 2d electron gas with minimal loss .",
    "the structure to be studied here is a sheet of 2d electron gas with rashba soi separated by a potential barrier into two semiplanes ( reservoirs ) between which a small voltage @xmath4 is applied .",
    "we are going to find electron and spin currents through the barrier , but begin with a discussion of wave functions for the whole system .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are components of electron momentum , @xmath7 is the soi parameter , @xmath8 the pauli matrices and @xmath9 the barrier potential .",
    "we consider here a rectangular barrier of high @xmath3 and width @xmath10 : @xmath11 at @xmath12 and @xmath13 at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the effective mass is supposed to be independent of the coordinates .",

    "the wave vector component @xmath20 is different for the barrier and the reservoirs .",
    "in addition it depends on the spin . in contrast",
    "the component @xmath21 is a conserved quantity and hence it is the same for all regions in a given state . the eigenfunctions and energy spectrum of homogeneous electron gas were studied in detail in ref .",
    "the main results which will be used below , are the following .",
    "since the considered system is not translationally invariant in the @xmath22 direction , the wave vector component @xmath20 can be complex : @xmath23 .",

    "we now turn to the calculation of electron and spin currents flowing normally to the barrier . for simplicity suppose that the 2d electron reservoirs to the left and right of the barrier are equipotential and the potential difference @xmath4 is small as compared to all characteristic energies of the system .",

    "in 2d electron gas with soi , the spin current is known to be a nonconserved quantity and therefore its definition is somewhat arbitrary . for this reason an important question arises of what quantity is really measurable . in this paper",

    "should be brought into a lateral contact with the soi system considered before .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to extend the discussed system by adding a contact with a normal region , which simulates ( at least partially ) a measuring device .",
    "the key problem to be solved is to find out how the spin current is transformed while passing through this contact .",
    "the problem is stated as follows .",
    "let a monoenergetic electron flow is incident from the soi region upon the sharp boundary with a normal region .",
    "the spin polarization of incident electrons is determined by a non - equilibrium occupancy of spin states at the fermi level , which is characterized by distribution functions of the states with positive and negative chiralities , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , with @xmath139 being the fermi wave vectors for the spin - split subbanbs .",
    "one needs to calculate the output spin current in the normal region as a function of the spin polarization of the incident current .",
    "this problem is solved by the same way as in the previous section .",
    "therefore , we describe below the key results without going into details .",
    "let us consider a simplified case where the distribution functions @xmath137 , @xmath138 are nonzero only for the states with positive velocity and do not depend on the momentum in this sector of the fermi surface , i.e. @xmath140 . the ratio of spin - subband populations determines the degree of the spin polarization of the incident electron flow .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath141 where @xmath142 the spin polarization being directed along @xmath123 axis .",
    "note , that far from the contact in the soi region the spin current does not depend on the coordinate @xmath22 , since electrons occupy the states with well defined spin .",
    "near to the contact , but before it , the situation changes essentially because the electrons having been reflected from the contact find themselves in a superposition of states with different spin .",
    "this results in the interference pattern in the spatial distribution of the spin current density similar to that shown in fig .  4 .",
    "behind the contact , in the normal region , the spin current does not depend on the coordinate since it is a conserved quantity .     in the normal region on the input polarization @xmath143 in the soi region in the case of @xmath144 for different fermi energies ( lines 1,2,3 ) .",
    "line 4 shows the result in the case case , when the distribution function of incident electrons fills the sector ( @xmath145 ) on fermi surface .",
    "the symbols mark the points , in which @xmath146 increases from -1.0 to 1.0 by steps 0.2 , moving from left to right .",
    "inset : the energy diagram of the structure.,width=302 ]    the spin polarization of the output current @xmath147 is defined similarly to equation ( [ p_s ] ) as the ratio of the transmitted spin current to the particle current .",
    "of interest is the relation between the output polarization , @xmath147 , and the input one , @xmath143 .",
    "the input polarization is changed by varying the spin - subband population according to equation ( [ p_in ] ) .",
    "we calculate the output and input polarizations while varying @xmath146 to find a dependence of @xmath148 on @xmath149 . this dependence is determined by the fermi energy @xmath150 and the potential step height @xmath151 at the contact between the soi and normal regions .",
    "we find that the efficiency of the spin current transformation when transferring through the contact increases with the decrease in @xmath151 .",
    "this means that the scattering on the contact conributes to the output polarization .",
    "the dependencies of @xmath147 on @xmath152 are shown in fig .  6 for the most favorable case when @xmath144 .",
    "they are nearly linear .",
    "thus , if @xmath153 , the spin current passes from soi region to normal electron gas practically without polarization loss .",
    "let us address to the problem of the spin polarization of the electron current through a barrier studied in the previous section .",
    "the largest polarization is reached at @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath155 , the spin is transferred into the normal 2d gas almost completely even if the distribution functions are uniformly smeared over the semi - circle as in the calculation of this section ( see lines 1 - 3 in fig.6 ) . in reality , the spin transfer efficiency is higher since the distribution function of transmitted electrons @xmath156 is strongly non - uniform over the azimuthal angle .",
    "this occurs because the probability for an electron to pass through the potential barrier decreases with increasing @xmath157 .",
    "one can say , that electrons are focused by the barrier near to @xmath22 axis . if the energy is close to the barrier top , the characteristic scale of the decrease of @xmath156 with @xmath24 is of the order of @xmath158 .",
    "we model this situation by calculating the polarization of the output current in the case where the states in sector @xmath159 , @xmath160 are only filled .",
    "the result is presented by line 4 in fig .",
    "of course , the scattering processes in the bulk reduce the spin polarization because they cause the distribution function to be more isotropic .",
    "electron transport through a lateral potential barrier in 2d system with soi produces the considerable spin polarization of the current , with the spin being directed perpendicularly to the current . behind the barrier the outgoing spin current depends on the distance in an oscillatory manner , but at sufficiently large distance from it the oscillations decay and the spin current reaches a constant value .",
    "the most effective generation of the spin current occurs when the fermi energy is close to the top of the potential barrier .",
    "the maximum degree of polarization at the distance far from the barrier exceeds 50% .",
    "the spin current generated in the 2d electron gas with soi can be successfully transmitted to a contacting normal 2d electron gas where the spin current is unambiguously defined .",
    "the spin polarization loss occurring while electrons pass from the soi region to the normal electron gas is negligible if the contact potential step and the characteristic soi energy are small compared to the barrier height and the fermi energy .",
