    "a narrow @xmath0(2317 ) meson was recently observed by the babar collaboration @xcite in the inclusive @xmath1 invariant mass distribution from @xmath2 annihilation and confirmed by the belle collaboration in @xmath3 meson decay @xcite .",
    "this meson has the natural spin - parity @xmath4 and a mass below what was obtained from the qcd sum rule approach @xcite and quark model calculations @xcite for a normal two - quark state @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath0(2317 ) meson has thus been considered as a possible candidate for the exotic four - quark states that were studied in the bag model @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite and the non - relativistic potential model @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the @xmath0(2317 ) meson is simply a @xmath6 molecule or atom .",
    "determination of the @xmath0(2317 ) meson width is limited by experimental resolutions to a value of less than 4.6 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the small width of @xmath0(2317 ) meson is not surprising as its mass is below the threshold of @xmath6 system and can only decay into the kinematically allowed but isospin violated channel of @xmath8 state .",
    "theoretically , the decay width of @xmath9 has been studied using the qcd sum rules , and its value varies from a few kev @xcite to a few tens kev @xcite depending on the assumed flavor state of four quarks or two quarks , respectively . a more phenomenological approach based on the @xmath10 model @xcite",
    "also gives a narrow width of about a few tens kev for a normal two - quark @xmath0(2317 ) meson .",
    "studying the mechanism for @xmath0(2317 ) meson production in nuclear reactions is useful for understanding its quark structure . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a coupled - channel quark model has been used to study the production of a two - quark @xmath0(2317 ) meson and its radial excitations in hadronic reactions .",
    "production of @xmath0(2317 ) in relativistic heavy ion collisions has also been studied @xcite .",
    "it was found that for a four - quark @xmath0(2317 ) meson , a much large yield is obtained if one takes into account the diquark - diquark interactions in the produced quark - gluon plasma . since the @xmath0(2317 )",
    "meson is not expected to survive in the quark - gluon plasma , it is more likely to be produced at hadronization of the quark - gluon plasma either statistically or via quark coalescence .",
    "its final abundance in a heavy ion collision depends , however , also on its absorption and production probability in the subsequent hadronic matter .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study @xmath0(2317 ) meson production in central heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in a kinetic model that starts from the final stage of the quark - gluon plasma , goes through a mixed phase of quark - gluon and hadronic matters , and finally undergoes the hadronic expansion .",
    "the production of @xmath0(2317 ) mesons from the quark - gluon plasma is modeled by the constituent quark coalescence model , which has been shown to describe reasonably not only the particle yields and their ratios @xcite but also their transverse momentum spectra and anisotropic flows @xcite .",
    "the predicted number of @xmath0(2317 ) mesons is found to depend on its quark structure , with the two - quark state giving an order - of - magnitude larger value than the four - quark state . the @xmath0(2317 )",
    "meson can be absorbed and also produced in subsequent hadronic matter via the reactions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the cross sections for these reactions are evaluated in a phenomenological hadronic model with coupling constants and form factors involving the @xmath0(2317 ) meson determined from the qcd sum rules .",
    "taking into account the hadronic effect in heavy ion collisions via a kinetic approach , we find that the final number of @xmath0(2317 ) mesons remains sensitive to its initial number produced from the quark - gluon plasma . studying @xmath0(2317 )",
    "meson production in heavy ion collisions thus provides the possibility to study both its production mechanism and quark structure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ dynamics ] , the dynamics of heavy ion collisions at rhic is described .",
    "production of @xmath0(2317 ) meson from the initial quark - gluon plasma via the quark coalescence model is discussed in section [ coalescence ] .",
    "the absorption cross sections of the @xmath0(2317 ) meson by hadrons such as the pion , rho , anti - kaon , and vector anti - kaon as well as their thermally averaged values are evaluated in section [ hadronic ] . solving the rate equation based on a kinetic model , time evolution of the @xmath0 ( 2317 ) meson abundance in heavy ion collisions",
    "is presented in section [ kinetic ] .",
    "a summary is then given in section [ summary ] .",
    "details on the derivation of an approximate analytical coalescence formula for @xmath0(2317 ) meson production from the quark - gluon plasma is given in appendix [ analytic ] , while those on the qcd sum - rule approach to the determination of the form factor at the @xmath15 vertex , which is needed in calculating the @xmath0(2317 ) meson absorption cross sections , is described in appendix [ qcd ] .",
    "to model the dynamics of central relativistic heavy ion collisions after the end of the quark - gluon plasma phase , we use the schematic model of ref.@xcite based on the boost invariant picture of bjorken @xcite and an accelerated transverse expansion .",
    "specifically , the volume of produced fire - cylinder in central au+au collisions at @xmath16 gev , which is the collision we are interested in , is taken to evolve with the proper time according to @xmath17 ^{2}\\tau c,\\]]where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are final transverse and longitudinal sizes of the quark - gluon plasma , while @xmath20 is its transverse flow velocity at this time .",
    "the total transverse energy of quarks and gluons in the midrapidity ( @xmath21 ) is then about @xmath22 gev if quarks and gluons are taken to be massive with @xmath23 mev , @xmath24 mev and @xmath25 mev in order to take into account the nonperturbative effects of qcd near the critical temperature @xcite , and if the quark strangeness and baryon chemical potentials are taken to be @xmath26 and @xmath27 mev , respectively , to account for strangeness neutrality in the quark - gluon plasma and observed final antiproton to proton ratio of about 0.7 at rhic .",
    "the fire - cylinder then goes through a mixed phase of partonic and hadronic matters at a constant temperature @xmath28 until @xmath29 fm/@xmath30 when its transverse radius and flow velocity are @xmath31 fm and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to a small transverse acceleration @xmath33 @xmath34/fm , which is chosen to reflect the small pressure near phase transition and in hadronic matter @xcite as well as to obtain a lifetime for the expanding matter comparable to that from the transport model @xcite .",
    "values of other parameters of the fire - cylinder are determined from fitting the measured transverse energy @xmath35 gev as well as the extracted freeze out temperature @xmath36 mev and transverse flow velocity @xmath37 of midrapidity hadrons in central au+au collisions at @xmath16 gev .",
    "assuming that the fire - cylinder expands isentropically , the fraction of hadronic matter during the mixed phase is found to increase approximately linearly , and the time dependence of the temperature of the fire - cylinder obtained in ref.@xcite can be parameterized as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the temperature of the hadronic matter at the end of the mixed phase and is thus the same as the critical temperature @xmath40 for the quark - gluon plasma to hadronic matter transition . as in ref.@xcite , we take @xmath41 mev .",
    "the freeze out temperature @xmath36 mev then leads to a freeze out time @xmath42 fm/@xmath30 .",

    "the nonzero strange chemical potential is needed to account for observed @xmath46 ratio in heavy ion collisions at rhic . neglecting the time dependence of the chemical potentials , which have been shown to vary weakly with the temperature of an isentropically expanding matter in heavy ion collisions at rhic @xcite , time evolution of the abundance of pions , kaons , anti - kaons , and nucleons has been shown in fig .  1 of ref.@xcite .",
    "including also contributions from decays of resonances , time evolution of the abundance of these hadrons is shown in fig.[pikn](a ) .",
    "it is seen that the total numbers of pions , kaons and anti - kaons do not change much during the hadronic stage while the nucleon number decreases significantly as temperature drops .",
    "their final numbers at freeze out are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively , and are comparable to those measured in experiments . in fig.[pikn](b ) , the time evolution of the ratio of anti - baryons to baryons is shown , and it changes from an initial value of @xmath51 to a final value of @xmath52 , which is also comparable to the measured value of about @xmath53 .",
    "in the coalescence model , the number of @xmath0(2317 ) mesons that are produced from the quark - gluon plasma is given by the product of a statistical factor @xmath54 which denotes the probability of combining @xmath55 or @xmath56 quarks into a color neutral , spin 0 , and isospin 0 hadronic state and depends on whether the @xmath0(2317 ) meson is a two - quark or four - quark state , and the overlap of the quark phase - space distribution function @xmath57 in the fire - cylinder with the wigner distribution function @xmath58 of the @xmath0(2317 ) meson .",
    "the latter corresponds to the probability of converting the above partonic state into @xmath0(2317 ) and is dependent of the quark spatial wave functions in the @xmath0(2317 ) meson .",
    "explicitly , the @xmath0(2317 ) number is expressed as @xmath59 with @xmath60 or @xmath61 for a two - quark or four - quark @xmath0(2317 ) .",
    "similar expressions have previously been used for studying the production of strange hadrons @xcite , charmed mesons @xcite , and penta - quark baryons @xcite from the quark - gluon plasma formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we note that the coalescence model can be viewed as formation of bound states from interacting particles with energy mismatch balanced by other particles in the system .",
    "neglecting such off - shell effects is reasonable if the binding energy is not large and/or if the production process is fast compared to the inverse of the energy mismatch .",
    "since the normalized quark wave function of the @xmath0(2317 ) meson in the color - spin - isospin space can be expressed as a linear combination of all possible orthogonal flavor , color , and spin basis states , with coefficients depending on the quark model used for the @xmath0(2317 ) meson , @xmath54 is simply given by the probability of finding these quarks in any one of these color - spin - isospin basis states , i.e. , @xmath62 or @xmath63 for a two - quark or four - quark @xmath0(2317 ) meson , respectively .",

    ", the covariant volume element can be written as @xmath71 .",
    "for the phase - space distribution functions of quarks in the fire - cylinder , they are taken to be the same as in the description of the heavy ion collision dynamics , i.e. , they are uniformly distributed in the transverse plane and their momentum distributions are relativistic boltzmannian in the transverse direction but uniform in rapidity along the longitudinal direction .",
    "also , the bjorken correlation of equal spatial @xmath72 and momentum @xmath73 rapidities is imposed , which is consistent with the small difference @xmath74 seen in the transport model @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the quark momentum distribution per unit rapidity at @xmath40 is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the color - spin degeneracy of a quark , @xmath77 is the radial - dependent transverse flow velocity , @xmath78 , and the quark chemical potential @xmath79 .",
    "the abundances of quarks at the end of the qgp phase in central au+au collisions at @xmath16 gev described by the expanding fire - cylinder model of previous section are @xmath80 , and @xmath81 at @xmath82 , if we take into account the effect of gluons by converting them into quarks according to the quark flavor composition in the quark - gluon plasma as in ref.@xcite . for charm quarks",
    ", we assume that they are in thermal equilibrium in the quark - gluon plasma , which is supported by the large elliptic flow of electrons from charmed meson decays that are observed in experiments @xcite and transport models @xcite .",
    "their number is , however , at present uncertain as it depends on whether charm quarks can be produced from the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "if we assume that the latter contribution is unimportant , then the number of charm quarks @xmath83 produced in heavy ion collisions is simply given by the product of the charm quark number @xmath84 produced from an initial hard nucleon - nucleon scattering and the total number of binary collisions ( about 960 ) in central au+au collisions . using @xmath84 from the pythia program , we obtain @xmath85 .",
    "the value of @xmath83 increases to about 3 and 7 if we use the @xmath86 from the phenix @xcite and the star experiment @xcite , respectively . in the following study",

    "for the wigner distribution function of the @xmath0(2317 ) meson , instead of using a function of lorentz invariant four - dimensional relative coordinates and momenta such as in refs.@xcite , we take it to be a function of three - dimensional relative coordinates and momenta for simplicity , based on the harmonic oscillator wave functions .",
    "specifically , it is obtained from assuming that the wave functions of the quarks are those of a harmonic oscillator with an oscillator frequency @xmath89 .",
    "for a two - quark @xmath0(2317 ) meson with @xmath90 , its @xmath5 quarks are in the relative @xmath91-wave and its wigner distribution function is thus @xcite @xmath92 in the above , we have used the usual definitions @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the relative coordinate and momentum of the two quarks , respectively . for the width parameter @xmath95 , it can be related to the oscillator frequency @xmath89 by @xmath96 with the reduced mass @xmath97 given by @xmath98 .",
    "if the @xmath0(2317 ) meson is a four - quark meson , its four quarks are all in relative s - waves , which then leads to the wigner distribution function @xmath99 where the relative coordinates @xmath100 and momenta @xmath101 are related to the quark coordinates @xmath102 and momenta @xmath103 by the jacobian transformations : @xmath104 and @xmath105 it can be shown that the product of the jacobians for the coordinate and momentum transformations is equal to one .",
    "the width parameter @xmath106 for the @xmath107-th relative coordinate in a four - quark @xmath0(2317 ) meson is again given by @xmath108 with the reduced masses @xmath109 we note that the reduced mass @xmath110 of the @xmath5 quark pair in a four - quark @xmath0(2317 ) meson is a factor of two larger than that in a two - quark @xmath0(2317 ) meson due to differences in the definitions of the relative coordinate and momentum .",
    "to evaluate the number of @xmath0(2317 ) mesons produced from the quark - gluon plasma requires information on the oscillator frequency @xmath89 through the width parameter @xmath95 in the @xmath0(2317 ) meson wigner distribution function , which is related to the size of @xmath0(2317 ) .",
    "since the latter is not known empirically , we choose the value of the oscillator frequency to fit instead the root - mean - square charge radius of the s - wave charmed @xmath111 meson .",
    "taking its wigner distribution function similar to eq.([wigner2 ] ) but with only one relative coordinate and momentum , we obtain the following mean - squared charge radius for the @xmath112 meson : @xmath113 in the above , @xmath114 is the center - of - mass coordinate of @xmath5 quarks , and we have used the relation @xmath115 between the mean - square distance and the width parameter for two quarks in the relative s - wave as in the @xmath112 meson . using the value @xmath116 determined from the light - front quark model @xcite , we find that @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    for a two - quark @xmath0(2317 ) meson , whose quarks",

    "the coalescence integral in eq.([coalmodel ] ) can be evaluated analytically if we expand the hyperbolic functions to first order , neglect the transverse flow , and use non - relativistic momentum distributions for quarks .",
    "the first approximation is valid for @xmath21 considered in present study .",
    "although the transverse flow affects strongly the transverse momentum spectrum of produced @xmath0(2317 ) mesons , it only has a small effect on its number . as shown in appendix",

    "above results are obtained by assuming that there are three charm quarks in the quark - gluon plasma , based on the number of charm quarks measured by the phenix collaboration in p+p collisions . if this number is increased by a factor of two , which is closer to that expected from the star experiment on d+au collisions , the final @xmath0(2317 ) meson numbers in both the coalescence and statistical models are increased by about a similar factor .",
