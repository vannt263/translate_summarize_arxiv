    "a wealth of results has been obtained since the dramatic early results shor:97,grover:96 on quantum speedups relative to classical algorithms .",
    "a relatively unexplored field is quantum algorithms for problems in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the earliest contribution to this subject lidar : pre97a obtained a modest speedup in that it avoided critical slowing down @xcite in the problem of sampling from the gibbs distribution for ising spin glass models . subsequently ref .",
    "@xcite raised the question of providing a classification of classical statistical physics problems in terms of their quantum computational complexity . in this work",
    "we shed light on this classification by considering the problem of evaluating the potts model partition function @xmath1 for classical spin systems on graphs .",
    "it is known that under particular conditions even certain approximations for @xmath1 are unlikely to be efficient , barring an @xmath3 surprise @xcite . here",
    "we present a class of sparse graphs ( which we call @xmath4 ) for which _ exact _ quantum evaluation of @xmath1 is possible with a polynomial speedup over the best classical algorithms available to date .",
    "let @xmath5 be a weighted graph with edge set @xmath6 and vertex set @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0-state potts model is a generalization of the ising model where a @xmath8-state spin resides on each vertex . in the ising model @xmath9 , whereas in the potts model @xmath10 .",
    "the edge connecting vertices @xmath11 and @xmath12 has weight @xmath13 , which is also the interaction strength between the corresponding spins .",
    "the potts model hamiltonian for a particular spin configuation @xmath14 is    @xmath15    where summation is over nearest neighbors , and where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) if @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "thus only nearest neighbor parallel spins contribute to the energy .",
    "the probability @xmath20 , of finding the spin in the potts model in some configuration @xmath21 at a given temperature @xmath22 , is given by the gibbs distribution    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the inverse temperature in energy units , and @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the normalization factor is the _ partition function _",
    "@xmath26    which plays a central role in statistical physics , since many thermodynamic quantities can be derived from it @xcite .",
    "when for all configurations @xmath27 , the probability distribution becomes flat : @xmath28 , so that at high temperatures randomness dominates .",
    "the partition function can be rewritten as a polynomial :    @xmath29    where@xmath30    now let us consider the case when the interactions @xmath13 are a constant @xmath31 .",
    "then the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) of this system can be written as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the subset of edges whose vertices have the same spin for a particular spin configuration @xmath21 , and @xmath34 is the number of such subsets . if we let @xmath35we can write the potts partition function as    @xmath36      there is a rich inter - relation between classical statistical mechanics and topology , in particular , the theory of the classification of knots .",
    "the first such connection was established by jones @xcite , who discovered the second knot invariant ( the jones polynomial ( a laurent polynomial ) , after the alexander polynomial ) during his investigation of the topological properties of braids @xcite .",
    "it is known that the classical evaluation of the jones polynomial is @xmath37p - hard jaeger:90 .",
    "the connection between knots and models of classical statistical mechanics was embellished by kauffman @xcite .",
    "knot invariants are , in turn , also tightly related to graph theory ; e.g. , the graph coloring problem can be considered an instance of evaluation of the kauffman bracket polynomial , via the tutte polynomial @xcite . the @xmath0-state potts partition function on a graph @xmath38",
    "is connected to the tutte polynomial @xmath39 for the same graph via @xmath40where as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) , @xmath41 .",
    "this means that the potts partition function is equivalent to some easily computed function times the tutte polynomial along the hyperbola @xmath42 .",
    "but for planar graphs , when @xmath43 the tutte polynomial is @xmath37p - hard to evaluate at points along @xmath44 @xcite . for a review of the connection between the potts partition function and the various polynomials mentioned above ,",
    "see @xcite and also nechaev:98,lidar : qwgt .",
    "it immediately follows from eq .",
    "( [ tutte ] ) and complexity results concerning the tutte polynomial , that the evaluation of the potts partition function is also @xmath37p - hard .",
    "it is not known whether there is an fpras ( fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme ) @xcite for the @xmath0-state fully ferromagnetic potts partition function , but it is known that if there is an fpras for the fully anti - ferromagnetic potts partition function then @xmath3 @xcite and therefore it seems unlikely that an fpras will be found for this case .",
    "the first connection between knots and quantum mechanics was established by witten , who showed that the jones polynomial can be expressed in terms of a topological quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "recently this connection was extended to the possibility of efficient evaluation of the jones polynomial by freedman and co - workers , after showing that quantum computers can efficiently simulate topological quantum field theory @xcite . more specifically , there are recent results demonstrating the efficacy of quantum computers in approximating the jones polynomial at primitive roots of unity @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite tools from topological quantum field theory @xcite were utilized and it was shown that approximating the jones polynomial at primitive roots of unity is bqp - complete , but no explicit algorithm was provided . more recently in @xcite ,",
    "a combinatorial approach was taken which yielded an explicit quantum algorithm and which extended the results in freedman:01 to all primitive roots of unity .",
    "this leads one to hypothesize that quantum computers will also be efficient at estimating partition functions .",
    "indeed , an immediate corollary of the results in freedman:01,aharonov:06,wocjan:06 , is that the potts partition function over any planar graph can be approximated efficiently on a quantum computer at certain _ imaginary _ temperatures ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this follows by noting that in order to obtain an equality between the potts partition function and the jones polynomial ( up to multiplication by an easily computed function ) , the jones variable @xmath45 and the temperature @xmath22 must be related by @xmath46 @xcite . with @xmath45 a root of unity ( @xmath47 ) we then find : @xmath48this result is of interest mainly in light of quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , where one retrieves real time _ dynamics _ from a simulation in terms of imaginary time , via analytic continuation . perhaps a similar extrapolation can be achieved here between imaginary and real temperature dynamics . while this is interesting , here",
    "we are concerned with _",
    "thermodynamics _ , and hence evaluations of the potts partition function at physically relevant , real temperatures .",
    "most closely related to our work is the very recent result due to aharonov _",
    "et al_. @xcite who  generalizing temperley - lieb algebra representations used in @xcite  provided a quantum algorithm for the additive approximation of the potts partition function ( and other points of the tutte plane ) for any planar graph with any set of weights on the edges .",
    "these results are the most impressive to date in the context of approximate evaluations of the potts partition function , but are also subject to certain caveats .",
    "to quote from the abstract of ref .",
    "@xcite : `` additive approximations are tricky ; the range of the possible outcomes , might be smaller than the size of the approximation window , in which case the outcome is meaningless . unfortunately , ruling out this possibility is difficult : if we want to argue that our algorithms are meaningful , we have to provide an estimate of the scale of the problem , which is difficult here exactly because no efficient algorithm for the problem exists ! '' . and : `` the case of the potts model parameters deserves special attention .",
    "unfortunately , despite being able to handle non - unitary representations , our methods of proving universality seem to be non- applicable for the physical potts model parameters .",
    "we can provide only weak evidence that our algorithms are non - trivial in this case , by analyzing their performance for instances for which classical efficient algorithms exist .",
    "the characterization of the quality of the algorithm for the potts parameters is thus left as an important open problem . '' finally , quoting from section 1.5 of ref .",
    "@xcite : `` proving anything about the complexity of our algorithm for the potts model , remains a very important open problem .",
    "it is still possible that this case of the tutte polynomial , with our additive approximation window , can be solved by an efficient classical algorithm . '' to summarize , ref .",
    "@xcite leaves as an open problem the complexity of physical instances ( real temperature , positive partition function ) under the restriction of an additive approximation . nor",
    "is it clear whether the algorithm found in ref .",
    "@xcite provides a quantum speedup .",
    "the authors state : `` we believe that the main achievement here is that we demonstrate how to handle non - unitary representations , and in particular , we are able to prove universality using non - unitary matrices . ''",
    "recently ref .",
    "@xcite gave a scheme for studying the partition function of classical spin systems including the potts and ising model .",
    "their approach involves transforming the problem of evaluating the partition function into the evaluation of a probability amplitude of a quantum mechanical system and then using classical techniques to extract the pertinent information .",
    "in essence their method involves moving into a quantum mechanical formalism to obtain a classical result .",
    "the scheme is therefore classical and not a quantum algorithm .",
    "in addition , two purely classical results should be mentioned here .",
    "one is a state of the art result by hartmann @xcite , who provides an algorithm which is well suited to large ferromagnetic systems for either the potts or ising model .",
    "we do not know the exact complexity of this algorithm , however . the approach taken in our work is to utilize the connection between classical coding theory and the partition function .",
    "for this reason we mention the classical algorithm given in @xcite for calculating the zeta function of certain curves .",
    "this is also a state of the art algorithm and it can be used to find the potts partition function via the scheme we present in this paper , though it is slower than using quantum resources .    a quantum algorithm for finding the zeta function of a curve is given in @xcite .",
    "one could replace the role that the gauss sum estimation @xcite plays in our scheme with this quantum algorithm for the zeta function .",
    "it seems that using gauss sums is more efficient but further work is required to make this conclusive .",
    "we present here a polynomial time quantum algorithm for the exact evluation of the @xmath0-state ( fully ferromagnetic or anti - ferromagnetic ) potts partition function @xmath1 for a certain class of graphs .",
    "this class of graphs , which we call irreducible cyclic cocycle code  @xmath4 graphs , comprises graphs whose incidence matrices generate certain cyclic codes .",
    "this and other concepts used below are given precise definitions in section [ back ] .",
    "the key ingredients used are the connection of @xmath1 to the weight enumerators of codes @xcite and a quantum algorithm for the approximation of gauss sums @xcite .",
    "the overall structure of the algorithm is the following :    1 .   given a graph @xmath5 ,",
    "first determine if @xmath38 belongs to the @xmath49 class .",
    "this decision problem can be solved efficiently using the quantum discrete log algorithm @xcite .",
    "if @xmath50 proceed to step 2 , else the algorithm may not evaluate @xmath51 efficiently .",
    "2 .   identify the linear code @xmath52 for which we shall determine the weight spectrum .",
    "3 .   using the quantum gauss sum estimation algorithm find the weight spectrum of the words in @xmath53 .",
    "this step is believed to be classically hard but the exact complexity is unknown .",
    "it is known , however , that this step is at least as hard as determining discrete log @xcite .",
    "this is the most expensive step of the algorithm due to the large number of words one has to deal with .",
    "this is because the number of possible spin configurations grows exponentially in the number of vertices .",
    "4 .   take a tally of the weight spectrum obtained in the previous step .",
    "grover s search algorithm can be used to give an additional quadratic speed up but this does not help in reducing the overall complexity since the computational cost of step 3 is greater than that of the current step .",
    "5 .   using the relation given by equation ( [ pottsa ] ) between the weight spectrum of a code and @xmath1 , use the tally from the previous step to obtain @xmath54 ( for graphs in @xmath49 ) .",

    "the motivation for this work is an ongoing effort to identify instances of classical statistical mechanics for which quantum computers will have an advantage over classical machines .",

    "one should note that @xmath253 is another instance of the tutte polynomial and so this connection is not surprising .",
    "the weight enumerator encodes information about all the different hamming weights of the code words in a linear code and the weight of a code word can be given by a formula involving a sum of gauss sums when dealing with a specific type of linear code .",
    "since there exists an efficient algorithm to approximate gauss sums via quantum computation @xcite we were able to efficiently calculate the weights of code words for certain codes .",
    "much of this paper dealt with the necessary restrictions that one must impose in order to achieve this last step .",
    "for example , once an error @xmath67 in the gauss sum algorithm is accepted , we demonstrated that there is a family of graphs for which one can find the exact partition function , and therefore the error does not scale within this family . given a graph @xmath38",
    ", one can map the graph to a corresponding linear code via the incidence structure of @xmath38 .",
    "the potts partition function of @xmath38 ( with either fully ferromagnetic or anti - ferromagnetic interactions ) is given by some easily computed function times the weight enumerator of the corresponding code .",
    "due to the symmetries inherent in the mathematical structure of linear codes we were able to provide an efficient method to exactly determine @xmath1 for a class of graphs ( @xmath4 ) which has a well defined correspondence to a subset of linear codes .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the exact evaluation of weight enumerators for binary linear codes is hard for the polynomial hierarchy . as our approach involved the exact evaluation of weight enumerators , it is not surprising that we had to make restrictions on the class of graphs so as to make our scheme efficient .",
    "the vantage that coding theory gives to this particular problem , however , allows one to utilize the fact that certain graphs have properties that a quantum computer can take advantage of to provide a speed up .",
    "notice that the related results in @xcite concern _ additive approximations _ ; the methods used in this paper can be extended to a wider class of graphs if one relaxes the requirement of exact evaluation and instead similarly considers additive approximations of @xmath1 .",
    "an open question is what instances of the potts partition function are amenable to an fpras ( fully polynomial random approximation scheme ) .",
    "the methods used in @xcite have proven to be quite powerful .",
    "there is hope to extend some of these methods to non - planar graphs .",
    "one idea is to extend the algorithm in @xcite to the jones polynomial for virtual knots and then use some correspondence between the virtual knots and non - planar graphs .",
    "another approach may involve seeing things in a new light .",
    "note that the jones polynomial is the euler characteristic of a certain chain complex @xcite .",
    "one can explore how effective quantum computers will be at approximating euler characteristics in general .",
    "perhaps there is a way of exploiting this in order to obtain knowledge about the potts partition function .",
    "one may also consider strengthening the results given here by exploiting theorems about the minimal distance of cyclic codes .",
    "for example , there are theorems that guarantee a lower bound for the weight between any two words . by enforcing that the generator polynomial of the code be of a certain form ,",
    "one would be guaranteed a certain distance between words and therefore the error in the gauss sum approximation will be of little consequence for certain graphs @xcite . as already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "another potentially promising approach is to consider the scheme we have presented here but to replace the gauss sum algorithm with the quantum algorithm for obtaining zeta functions @xcite .",
    "work has to be done on understanding the exact cost of this algorithm when one is restricted to curves that are pertinent for the evaluation of the potts model .",
    "corollary  [ cor ] deals with the combination of graphs via a direct sum of codes gives one a way of tiling  graphs for which one knows the partition function .",
    "this gives a quick way of obtaining the partition function of certain graphs that are made of many repeats of a simpler graph .",
    "there are other ways of combining codes that may allow one to study the partition function of new graphs , for example the concatenation or direct product of two codes lint : book .",
    "the coding theoretic approach does give us a way of evaluating the partition function of instances of the potts model at arbitrary temperatures but precisely the kinds of graphs which are involved is a question for future research .",
    "indeed , the identification of the physical instances represented by the graphs for which our algorithm is efficient will shed light on the question that motivated this work in the first place @xcite : what is the quantum computational complexity of classical statistical mechanics ?",
