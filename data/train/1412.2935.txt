    "ionized outflowing gas from the central engines of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has been studied for thirty years ( since * ? ? ? * ) . in about 50% of seyfert i galaxies , outflowing gas",
    "is characterized by blue - shifted absorption lines in the uv band @xcite and/or the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the gas has a high covering fraction , a total mass exceeding @xmath3 , and is outflowing at a rate of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it may have a significant impact on the evolution of the host galaxy , when its kinetic luminosity reaches 0.5% of the bolometric luminosity of agn @xcite . a significant fraction of seyfert i galaxies can reach this criterion ( e.g. , @xmath53 in 10 nearby seyfert i galaxies , * ? ? ?",
    "however , a key question that complicates the determination of kinetic luminosity of outflowing gas is its distance from the black hole ( bh ) , and hence its geometry . in only a few sources",
    "are the distance and the geometry well constrained through careful studies in recent years @xcite .",
    "ideally , it is possible to probe the geometric and physical properties of photoionized outflowing gas by combining the information from uv and x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray absorbing gas contains a multitude of ions with up to @xmath0100 observable transitions in x - ray spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ionization states cover a large range and overlap with those of the uv absorbing gas .",
    "the gas at very high ionization states can only be detected in x - ray spectra , while uv band spectra have advantages in detecting absorption lines from gas at low ionization states and with low column densities .",
    "however , the observations in the two bands do not merely offer the complementarity of a broader - band view of the ionization structure of the plasma .",
    "uv observations have significantly higher spectral resolution and so are able to supply better kinematic information by resolving complicated profiles of absorption lines . components with different velocities can be fully distinguished , and their turbulent velocities can be estimated .",
    "if reliable column densities for several ionic species are obtained simultaneously , elemental abundances can be estimated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the geometric and physical properties of the outflowing gas can be inferred from the distributions of ionization state , column density , velocity and abundance . moreover ,",
    "relative positions of the absorbing gas to different emitting components are easier to be obtained in the uv band .",
    "any variability in the uv and x - ray bands will also constrain on the locations .",
    "it has been proven difficult to perform joint analyses of uv and x - ray spectra , because it is hard to find an one - to - one relation of absorbers between the two bands .",
    "the reason is that the ionization level and kinematics of both the uv absorbers and x - ray warm absorbers ( was ) are sometimes difficult to measure , and there is often only partial overlap in the conditions of the two sets of absorbers @xcite . using recent high spectral - resolution telescopes and instruments , there have been numerous multi - wavelength uv - x - ray campaigns .",
    "these provide much insight into the physical conditions in the absorbing outflows .",
    "however , a broad understanding of these outflows has yet to emerge , and the relationship between the x - ray and uv absorbing gas is still not understood in many cases . in most cases ,",
    "uv absorbing gas is likely associated with the x - ray was , but frequently one x - ray wa may correspond to a blend of several uv absorbers ( e.g. , ngc 3516 , @xcite ; ngc 4593 , @xcite ; 1h0419 - 577 , @xcite ; mrk 279 , @xcite ; mrk 509 , @xcite ; mr 2251 - 178 , @xcite ) . in other cases",
    ", the absorbing gas may favor a continuous distribution of ionization states in a smooth flow , instead of discrete components ( e.g. , ngc 5548 , @xcite ; ngc 7469 , @xcite ; iras , 13349 + 2438 @xcite ) .",
    "in other cases , variability of the absorbers interfere with identification ( e.g. , ngc 3783 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a & b ) ; ngc 4051 , @xcite ) . in particular cases , e.g. in ngc 4151 , strong emission lines in the x - ray band",
    "contaminate the detection of was at lower ionization states @xcite . in summary , absorbers are complicated in the both bands , and their information is not easy to be combined .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on a nearby seyfert i galaxy , mrk 290 , which shows an extremely simple absorption system in the uv band @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , only three x - ray was were detected in its outflow using the  high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) in our previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter z11 ) .",
    "this is therefore a relatively clean case with advantages for the illustration of joint analysis .",
    "mrk 290 fortunately has simultaneous observations with  and  in 2003 ( paper related to  observations is in preparation ) .",
    "however , the exposure time of that  observation is relatively short . in order to demonstrate how our new method helps the joint analysis in the two bands , we use hst cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) observations in 2009 instead , which has a good spectral resolution and a higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the most likely origin of the was in mrk 290 is from a slow torus wind ( several 100 ) , based on constraints from the x - ray band .",
    "thus it is possible that the uv and x - ray observations reveal the same components even when the observations are separated by years .",
    "the prevalent method in uv studies is to compare individual lines in velocity space .",
    "information on different aspects of each absorption line , such as column density , ionization state , covering fraction , broadening , and saturation , is collected and combined to infer physical quantities of the outflowing gas .",
    "the process requires laborious work . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate a novel and simple method to combine the information from the uv and x - ray bands .",
    "we fit the uv spectra directly using synthetic spectral models generated by the xstar photoionization code , the same modeling technique as was used for the x - ray data .",
    "the construction of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the data reduction in section 2 , and the xstar code in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we decompose the uv spectrum into different physical components , and then describe corresponding models for them .",
    "the detailed modeling of the ionized absorbers is given in section 5 , and the discussion and exploration is given in section 6 .",
    "we end with a summary of our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "the cos was installed on hst in may 2009 .",
    "it has two medium - resolution gratings , g130 m and g160 m , covering the wavelength range 1135 - 1795   with spectral resolutions of @xmath6 from 16,000 to 21,000 @xcite .",
    "mrk 290 was observed with cos on oct .",
    "28 , 2009 , with a total exposure time of 8 ks .",
    "the cos observations and the calibration data were retrieved from the multimission archive ( mast ) and processed with the pipeline calcos ( version 2.19.6 ) .",
    "spectra extracted from individual exposures were weighted by their signal - to - noise ratios and then co - added to form a final spectrum . by comparing ism absorption lines from complex c @xcite , @xcite found the zero - point offset of the cos spectrum to be + 17 , which is corrected for in this paper .    in this paper , we adopt a new technique for the analysis of the uv data . for the first time",
    ", we fit the uv data from cos using techniques which are customary for x - ray data . to provide the potential capability for a joint analysis of the uv and x - ray bands , we convert the uv spectrum into the style usually used in the x - ray band .",
    "we used the idl tool pintofale to simulate a pulse height amplitude ( pha ) file from the co - added cos spectrum and also to generate a corresponding response ( rsp ) file by convolving the line spread functions ( lsf ) of g130 m and g160 m .",
    "we fit the data using the interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis version 1.6.2 , * ? ? ?",
    "during the fit , a model spectrum is folded through the rsp file in order to generate synthetic data , which is then compared with the observed data .",
    "the models used to fit the data are calculated using the xstar photoionization code .",
    "xstar is used to compute physical conditions and synthetic spectra of photoionized plasmas .",
    "it performs the computationally intensive task of calculating profiles for a large number of lines , and allows interactive fitting of data to models via the use of tables of synthetic spectra .",
    "xstar calculates the ionization balance , atomic level populations and electron kinetic temperature for gas ranging from neutral atoms to fully stripped ions , and includes all elements with atomic number z@xmath730 .",
    "the operation of xstar and its database have been described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "xstar contains the microphysical rates and line lists needed to model optical , uv and x - ray emission from such gas .",
    "synthesizing spectra with the resolution of cos , however , requires expanding many of the data structures used in the spectral calculation .",
    "this modification , contained in xstar version 2.2.1bn19 and newer , allows the synthesis of spectra with resolving power up to @xmath8 .",
    "the spectral resolution is an input parameter which can be controlled by the user , and the maximum value represents approximately an order of magnitude increase compared with previous versions . in addition , we have updated the line database to include several low ionization lines which are observed from the milky way and its halo .",
    "although the increased resolving power results in a proportional increase in execution time , this is mitigated by the availability of batch execution using pvm_xstar @xcite , so that useful grids of models can be computed within a few days . with these improvements , photoionization models generated by xstar",
    "cover the uv and x - ray bands simultaneously , allowing fitting results from the two bands to be compared with each other directly .    in the case of xstar models ,",
    "the free parameters used in fitting are usually the column density @xmath9 , the ionization parameter of the gas @xmath10 , ( where @xmath11 is the incident flux in the 1 - 1000 ry energy range , and @xmath12 is the hydrogen nucleus density ) , and the redshift @xmath13 , while the temperature , density , turbulent velocity and elemental abundances are set by users , as shown in table  [ tab : input ] . beside these",

    "in the cos spectrum , absorption and emission lines are heavily mixed ( fig .  [",
    "fig : cos ] ) . to get the information of the intrinsic absorbers in mrk 290 , it is preferable to decompose all the physical components .",
    "three components need to be taken into account : agn intrinsic emission , agn intrinsic absorption , and local absorption . the other two components to notice are the intergalactic medium ( igm ) absorption and the geo - coronal emission from the earth atmosphere .",
    "geo - coronal emission originates mainly from hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the exosphere of the earth . in this cos observation , there are three prominent geo - coronal features : ly@xmath1 ( 1215.7  ) and  doublet ( 1302   and 1306  ) . during all the modeling ,",
    "two narrow bands ( 12101225   & 13001308  ) containing the geo - coronal lines are removed , though there is a local  absorption line between the  doublet .",
    "two nearby ly@xmath1 absorption lines from the igm absorber are detected at 1228   and 1228.5  , around the redshift @xmath18 , and the corresponding  absorption is also identified in the  spectrum @xcite .",

    "we model them simply with one negative gaussian to reduce the @xmath19 .    eliminating the geo - coronal features and the igm absorption ,",
    "we discuss the three primary parts in detail as follows . in this work",
    ", all the quoted errors refer to 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter .",
    "the local absorption is from high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) and galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "hvcs are low - metallicity clouds plunging toward our galaxy and interacting with its ambient halo gas @xcite .",
    "the line of sight toward mrk 290 penetrates hvc complex c , whose absorption lines in the cos spectrum have been studied by @xcite in detail .",
    "two absorbers were identified with blueshift velocities of -120 and -220 .",
    "the absorber with -220  velocity is at a higher ionization state , which shows shallow ,  and  absorption lines .",
    "the absorber with -120  velocity has both lower ionization lines ( , , , , , , , ) and higher ionization lines ( , , , ) .",
    "complex c is diffuse gas ionized by uv background photoionization and possible interactions with galactic halo gas .",
    "we produce an xstar table model for its absorption , in which many input parameters are from the results of @xcite .",
    "they obtained the column density of @xmath20 , the hydrogen nucleus density of 0.2 @xmath21 , and the turbulent velocity of @xmath025 .",
    "the metals have abundances less than 25% solar metallicities @xcite as follows : c ( 10% ) , o ( 10% ) , n ( 1.5% ) , s ( 17% ) , si ( 21% ) , fe ( 5% ) , al ( 4% ) and p ( 23.4% ) , where the c abundance is adopted from the nearby lines of sight to mrk 817 and mrk 876 .",
    "we set the temperature as @xmath14 k , which does not affect the table model much in the range of @xmath17 k @xcite to @xmath22 k @xcite .",
    "the ionization parameter and the redshift are left as free parameters in the model .",
    "galactic ism absorption is attributed to ions , atoms , molecules and dust .",
    "the molecular absorption is beyond the far uv end of the cos spectrum .",
    "the neutral gas absorbs the hydrogen lyman series , i.e. ly@xmath1 in the cos spectrum .",
    "but this narrow band ( 1210 - 1225  ) is removed in all the fittings due to the geo - coronal ly@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the cos spectrum is mainly affected by the ions in warm ionized gas and by dust extinction .",
    "the warm ism gas is photoionized by the uv background radiation @xcite . in the cos spectrum ,",
    "its absorption lines are similar to the lines from hvc .",
    "we also use xstar to produce the photoionization table model for this component .",
    "the density is set to 0.3 @xmath21 , the temperature to 8000 k @xcite , the turbulent velocity to 20 , and the metallicity abundance to solar values .",
    "the column density , the ionization parameter and the redshift are left as free parameters . along the line of sight",
    "to mrk 290 , there is a relatively low galactic absorption @xmath23 obtained by 21 cm measurements @xcite .",
    "removing the contribution from hvc , we have an upper limit for the column density of the warm ionized gas in ism of @xmath24 .",
    "galactic dust extinction attenuates uv continuum radiation , which can be corrected using extinction curves derived from other lines of sight .",
    "we use the extinction curve formula described by @xcite that covers the wavelength range from 910   to 3.3 @xmath25 m .",
    "the parameters used are a total - to - selective extinction ratio of @xmath26 @xcite , and an extinction of @xmath27 at the line of sight to mrk 290 @xcite .",
    "there is no free parameter for the dust extinction component .",
    "it is generally assumed that agn intrinsic emission in the uv band comes from the accretion disk , broad line region ( blr ) and narrow line region ( nlr ) . to fit the entire spectrum ,",
    "it is possible to use phenomenological spline fits @xcite .",
    "this method has the disadvantage that it does not recognize broad absorption features and can not constrain physical properties of the emitting gas from different regions . in this work ,",
    "we want to disentangle the radiation from different regions so we can apply absorption models accordingly , especially when the intrinsic absorbers in mrk 290 are likely located between the blr and the nlr ( z11 ) .",
    "in addition , two adjacent intrinsic  absorption lines ( @xmath01595  ) in the cos spectrum are just at the peak of a  emission line , which contaminates the spline fits . as a consequence , we adopt a different approach to fit the spectrum .",
    "we first analyze the radiation from the blr and the nlr and construct xstar table models .",
    "we then combine these with a model for the radiation from the accretion disk of mrk 290 , a featureless continuum in the cos band ( 1140 - 1800  ) , which we describe as a power law @xcite .",
    "the photoionized clouds in the blr and the nlr show many emission lines , including ly@xmath1 , , , , , ,  and other weak lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cos ] ) .",
    "the profiles of these lines are complex , and this complexity mainly originates from the blr .",
    "the motions of the blr clouds might be a superposition of different components , such as doppler motions , turbulence , shock components , in / outflow components , and rotation ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and can be altered by radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "moreover , different geometries of the blr can conspire with these components to result in similar line profiles .",
    "there is no way to uniquely infer the global blr motion and geometry from line profile fitting .",
    "line broadening is affected by cloud motion which can be a combination of rotational and radial .",
    "a plausible assumption is that the cloud speeds are approximately virial , i.e. @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the central mass , and @xmath30 is the distance from the center .",
    "if so , the blr can consist of several groups of clouds with different speeds , and faster the speed of the component , the closer it is to the bh .",
    "each velocity component is assumed to have the same ionization condition and share one fwhm value to address the line broadening .     and",
    "the  doublet are fitted with four groups of gaussians ( red ) .",
    "the dash lines ( green ) represent the three blr components that contribute to ly@xmath1 , while the dash - dotted line ( purple ) shows the ly@xmath1 emission from the nlr.,width=336 ]    the best target for profile decomposition is the ly@xmath1 emission line combined with the  doublet ( 1238.8 , 1242.8  ) , which has high signal - to - noise ratio in the cos spectrum .",
    "a summation of several velocity components from both the blr and the nlr is adopted to mimic their line profiles .",
    "each velocity component has three gaussians with the same fwhm to contribute to the three lines , two of which for the  doublet have an optically thin 2:1 flux ratio between the strong and weak lines . the wavelength band of 12251300   is included for the fit , while all the absorption features are removed or fitted with negative gaussians .",
    "finally , at least four velocity components are required to give a good fit to the line profiles of the ly@xmath1 and the  doublet simultaneously ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lymana ] ) .",
    "the fwhms of the four components are distinctive : 10183@xmath31344 , 5550@xmath3135 , 1351@xmath3122 and 417@xmath316 .",
    "the narrowest one of 417  is consisted with that of the forbidden lines [ ] ( 4959 , 5007",
    " ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectrum of mrk 290 with a fwhm of 400 , suggesting that this narrowest component originates from the nlr .",
    "thus , the other three velocity components are attributed to the blr .",
    "the redshift of the narrowest component is 0.030540 , slightly larger than the redshift 0.0304 obtained from the sdss spectrum that we used in z11 . since cos has a better spectral resolution than sdss , we correct the redshift of mrk 290 to 0.030540 .",
    "we generate three xstar table models for the blr and one table model for the nlr . for them ,",
    "@xmath32 values are used in xstar for producing equal fwhms of line profiles : @xmath33 .",
    "the density of the blr is set to @xmath34 , while that of the nlr is set to @xmath35 according to the flux ratio of [ ] ( 6716 , 6731  ) doublet that is @xmath01 in the sdss spectrum . for both ,",
    "the column density is set to @xmath36 , the temperature is set to 15000 k , the metallicities are set to the solar values , while the ionization parameter and the redshift are left as free parameters .",
    "the ionizing sed of mrk 290 used in xstar is similar to the low - state sed in z11 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is obtained from  observations in 2007 , which is close to the cos observations in 2009 , while other data are from nasa / ipac extragalactic database : radio 4.8 ghz data from very large array ( vla ) , 25 @xmath25 m data from infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) and r - band data from sdss . for the uv data point",
    ", we adopt the extinction - corrected flux at 1500   of the cos spectrum to avoid contamination from emission lines .",
    "the clouds in the blr partially cover the ionizing source , which means that the blr emission is from two parts : light transmitted by the clouds in the forward direction to observers , and light in the backward direction reflected by the clouds .",
    "xstar calculates spectra for the both parts , which have quite different line ratios . for the simplicity",
    ", we set the parameter of covering factor in xstar as 0.1 for the blr components , and define an additional parameter ( @xmath37 ) to indicate deviations of the covering fraction to the fixed value of 0.1 .",
    "this free parameter is the ratio of ` normalization ' values of the two spectra for the transmitted and reflected emission ( the other parameters in the xstar model are the same for the two spectra ) .",
    "the blr covering fraction will become larger when @xmath37 increases , because more clouds are blocking the reflected emission along our line of sight .      in the cos spectrum of mrk 290 , ly@xmath1 ,  and  doublets",
    "are detected near redshift 0.0287 . the  and  lines show clear double troughs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : na ] ) , suggesting at least two absorbers . for the purpose of obtaining turbulent velocities of the absorbers , we fit these nine intrinsic absorption lines with negative gaussians ( table  [ tab : lines ] ) , while the modeling of the background continuum is described in detail in section 5.1 .",
    "when fitting the  and  doublets , we assume that they come from two absorbers , and thus for each absorber we relate their wavelengths according to the laboratory values and set their fwhms to be the same .",
    "the blueshift velocities of the two absorbers are -590 and -525 , and the corresponding fwhms are 31 and 51 , respectively .",
    "the outflow velocities of the intrinsic uv absorbers are coincident with the was measured from the  x - ray spectra in z11 ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) . given the parameters of the three was obtained in the x - ray band , we use xstar to predict their behaviors in the uv band ( fig .  [ fig : xwa ] ) and to check the possibility that the intrinsic absorption lines in the two bands are caused by the same ionized gas .",
    "the highest ionization ( hi ) wa with log@xmath38 does not show any significant absorption , the moderately ionization ( mi ) wa with log@xmath39 absorbs ly@xmath1 , and the lowest ionization ( li ) wa with log@xmath40 shows ly@xmath1 ,  and  absorption lines .",
    "thus , the two uv absorbers identified from the double troughs of the  and  doublets are similar to the li wa , which is detected as one in the x - ray band because of the lower spectral resolution .",
    "the ly@xmath1 absorption line may still be affected by the mi wa , especially when the ly@xmath1 line is heavily saturated .    a clear smooth truncation at the bottom of the ly@xmath1 absorption line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : na ] ) suggests heavy saturation .",
    "it is important to check whether the  and  doublets are saturated , which affects the determination of the ionization states of the absorbers .",
