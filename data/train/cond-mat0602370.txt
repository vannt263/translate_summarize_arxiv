    "growth is a natural process by which a system , for example , a tree acquires a history - dependent ( or a _ causal _ ) structure . since",
    "a growing tree is never ungrown , its growth is an irreversible process .",
    "a generic but informal description of its structural features evolves from repeated observations of a variety of structural forms that these systems acquire during their natural growth . whether it is also",
    "a meaningful statistical description depends on whether the collection of such irreversibly grown structures is amenable to a statistical mechanical study . in the case of causal and homogeneous networks",
    "[ 1 ] , it has been shown that growing ( non - equilibrium ) networks can be assigned appropriate growth probabilities and studied within the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "a trivial special case of a causal network is a kinetic growth walk ( kgw ) [ 3 - 8 ] which may be considered as an ordered collection of nodes ( linear chain of monomers ) such that two of them are of degree one ( end monomers ) while the others are of degree two each .",
    "it generates a self avoiding walk ( saw ) [ 2 ] configuration , step - by - step , by choosing one of the allowed steps at random with equal probability .",
    "since the number of allowed steps at the growing end of the walk is a variable that depends on the configuration grown already , such a step - by - step growth is locally biassed .",
    "averages taken over a collection of kgws , uncorrected for the cumulative bias acquired during its growth , clearly establish the fact that kgw belongs to the same universality class as saw [ 3 - 8 ] .",
    "in other words , like in the case of causal networks , the distinction between equilibrium ( saw ) and non - equilibrium ( kgw ) configurations does not affect the scaling behaviour of the walk .",
    "this prompts us to take a closer view of how a collection of kgw configurations might be related to an ( equilibrium ) ensemble of saws .",
    "in fact , the bias - uncorrected kgw on a honeycomb lattice has been shown [ 9 ] to be exactly equivalent to a canonical ensemble of interacting saws ( isaws ) [ 10 ] at the bath temperature proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "these facts , put together , could be misconstrued to imply a general equivalence of kgw with isaw at some bath temperature . except for a hint",
    "[ 11 ] that kinetic walks may not be equivalent to canonical walks , no definitive study of this equivalence relation is available in the literature . in this paper , we present monte carlo evidence to show that such an equivalence does not exist on a square as well as on a triangular lattice .",
    "this is an explicit demonstration of the fact that the kgw is not , in general , equivalent to isaw at any bath temperature .      starting from some arbitrarily chosen site on a regular lattice of coordination number @xmath1 , there are @xmath1 possibilities for making the first step .",
    "for all subsequent non - reversal steps , we have a maximum of @xmath2 possibilities to choose from .",
    "if , at any stage , we choose a step that takes us to a site already visited , we discard the process and start afresh from the beginning .",
    "this ensures that every site in the walk is visited once , and once only .",
    "it is clear that the probability of generating a successful @xmath3-step walk configuration can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the number possibilities available for the @xmath7 step .",
    "if @xmath5 is taken to be @xmath2 for all the steps , then all the walk configurations are gernerated with equal probability , say @xmath8 , and are said to form an ensemble of self avoiding walks ( saws ) [ 2 ] .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath5 is the actual number of possibilities available for the @xmath7 step , then different configurations of the walk , called kinetic growth walk ( kgw ) [ 3 - 8 ] , are generated with different probabilities .",
    "@xmath9 \\\\              & = & \\exp \\left(\\sum _ { k=2}^{n}ln\\left[\\frac{z-1}{z_k}\\right]\\right ) p_{saw}(n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whenever @xmath10 , we encounter non - bonded nearest neighbors , called _ contacts _ ; the number of such _ contacts _ encountered at the @xmath7 step is given by @xmath11 , which when added up give the total number of contacts , @xmath12 , in the walk .      the probability of generating an @xmath3-step kgw configuration with @xmath12 contacts is given by [ 9 ] , @xmath13 which follows from the fact that the walk has no choice but to take the only available step after making a contact . since the total number of @xmath3-step saws , @xmath14 , can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of saws with @xmath12 _ contacts _ , the total number of kgws on a honey - comb lattice is given by @xmath17 thus , the kgw corresponds to the canonical ensemble of isaws [ 10 ] realized at an inverse temperature , @xmath18 if the magnitude of the energy per contact , @xmath19 , is taken to be unity . at any other bath temperature ,",
    "@xmath20 , kgw is identical to an isaw at a lower temperature , @xmath21 .",
    "algorithmically , we _ first _ choose an available site at random ( kgw rule ) and _ then _ assign the boltzmann factor @xmath22 if a contact was made .",
    "the number of sites available for the current step is either one or two or three depending on whether , in the previous step , the walk had made a double contact or a single contact or no contact respectively .",
    "the probability of generating an @xmath3-step kgw configuration that has made @xmath23 single contacts and @xmath24 double contacts during its growth is therefore given by @xmath25 note that contacts made by the @xmath26 step , if any , is not accounted for by the growth probability @xmath27 .",
    "so , the total number of contacts made by the walk configuration is @xmath28 it is not necessary that all the configurations with the same total number of contacts will be grown with the same probability because , growth being a history - dependent process , they could realize different pairs of values @xmath29 for the same value of @xmath12 .",
    "for example , consider an @xmath30-step configuration encoded as @xmath31 [ 12 ] that has a total of three contacts ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the same configuration when grown in the reverse direction , encoded @xmath33 , has only encountered single contacts ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the fact that the total number of saw configurations with @xmath12 contacts , @xmath16 , may be written as a double sum , @xmath35-n),\\ ] ] suggests that the total number of kgw configurations with @xmath12 contacts , @xmath36 , may also be given a similar expression - namely , @xmath37}\\delta ( [ n_1 + 2n_2]-n)\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "they may be interpreted as the inverse temperatures associated with the single and the double contacts respectively if @xmath40 is taken to be the ( additive ) energy per contact . since ( @xmath41 ) ,",
    "a double contact is colder than a single contact !",
    "configurations that are identical but grown in opposite directions are also counted into the expression for @xmath36 by virtue of the fact that they correspond to different pairs @xmath42 .",
    "it is therefore clear that we have a distribution of @xmath42 s ( or equivalently , a distribution of dimensionless contact - energy , @xmath43 arising due to the history - dependence of the growth process .    a canonical relation between @xmath36 and @xmath16 can be defined only if an average inverse temperature @xmath44 for a configuration with @xmath12 contacts can be defined : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the average number of single and double contacts respectively for a configuration with @xmath12 contacts and may , in general , depend on @xmath12 . averaging out the history - dependence this way leads to the following expression for the total number of kgw configurations on a square lattice : @xmath48 it is still not in the canonical form , in contrast to that for a honey - comb lattice ( eq.(6 ) ) , because @xmath44 is an intrinsic geometric parameter that characterizes a configuration with a given number of contacts . and not the inverse canonical ( or bath ) temperature",
    ".       values for @xmath52-step kgw configurations on a triangular lattice as well as on a square lattice .",
    "it is a truncated distribution to which a gaussian could be fitted .",
    "the relevant parameters are ( i ) peak position @xmath53 ; ( ii ) width @xmath54.,width=336,height=264 ]    , of a kgw for @xmath55 .",
    "a gaussian could be fitted to this distribution for @xmath52-step kgws on a square lattice ( sq ) as well as on a triangular lattice ( tr ) .",
    "the relevant parameters are , ( i ) peak value @xmath56 ; ( ii ) width @xmath57,width=336,height=264 ]    a further averaging of the @xmath44 values leads to the canonical expression @xmath58 identifying @xmath59 as the inverse bath temperature is , however , not justifiable because a canonical sampling of saws with @xmath60 may not lead to kgws .",
    "such an interpretation is unique to honey - comb lattice only .",
    "the monte carlo estimates of @xmath59 , plotted in fig.1 for various walk - lengths , @xmath3 , extrapolate to the asymptotic value @xmath61 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath59 values for a given walk - length , @xmath62 in fig.2 , is _ a priori _ expected to be a truncated one because @xmath59 is bounded between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "however , a gaussian ( width @xmath65 , peak position @xmath66 ) could be fitted to the distribution .",
    "the question remains whether @xmath67 or @xmath68 could be identified as the bath temperature .",
    "the fact that kgw belongs to the same universality class as saw does not provide a reason to a choose between the two , though they are both above the expected @xmath69-temperature ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "moreover , such an arbitrary choice also leads to non - additive contact energy .",
    "a kgw on a triangular lattice is , in general , characterized by four inverse temperatures ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) associated respectively with a single , double , triple and quadruple contacts .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath73 is greater than the expected @xmath69-point value ( @xmath74 ) , whereas the others are less .",
    "the total number of kgws on a triangular lattice may be given an approximate canonical form , similar to the one for kgws on a square lattice ( eq.13 ) : @xmath75 where the asymptotic value of @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) could be obtained by extrapolating the data presented in fig.1 .",
    "the truncated distribution of @xmath76 values , plotted in fig.2 for walk - length @xmath62 , is again fitted to a gaussian , which peaks at @xmath78 and whose width is @xmath79 .      in general ,",
    "a kgw on a two dimensional lattice of coordination number @xmath1 is characterized by a set of @xmath80 inverse temperatures , @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , defined by @xmath83}\\right ) \\quad ; \\quad m = 1 , 2,\\cdots , z-2\\ ] ] whose weighted average gives the canonical value @xmath84 : @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the average number of @xmath87-contacts made .",
    "note that @xmath88 for walks without contacts ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the dimensionality dependence comes through the realizable values of @xmath90s . as pointed out earlier",
    ", it is more appropriate to interpret @xmath84 as an intrinsic geometric parameter that characterizes the kgw than to interpret it as an inverse bath temperature .",
    "however , it may serve as a simple scale - shift parameter for the inverse bath temperature if all the kgw configurations are reweighted so as to correspond to @xmath84 . the reason why kgw turns out to be equivalent to saw",
    "could be that the entire truncated distribution of @xmath84s lies below the corresponding @xmath69-point value .",
