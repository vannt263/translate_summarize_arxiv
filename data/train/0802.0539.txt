    "the search for inexpensive renewable energy sources has sparked considerable interest in the development of photovoltaics based on conjugated polymers and organic molecules @xcite . compared to silicon - based devices ,",
    "polymer solar cells are lightweight , inexpensive to fabricate , flexible , and have an ultra - fast opto - electronic response @xcite .",
    "they also exhibit a nearly continuous tunability of the energy levels and band gaps via molecular design and synthesis , versatile materials processing and device fabrication schemes , and low cost industrial manufacturing on a large scale @xcite .",
    "however , the energy conversion efficiency of existing organic and polymeric solar cells with donor / acceptor blends is still less than 5% @xcite .",
    "though both organic and conventional solar cells operate by absorbing light , a fundamental difference was recognized almost immediately .    in organic materials , the light absorption results in the formation of excitons rather than the free electrons and holes directly produced in inorganic semiconductors , such as silicon @xcite .",
    "the bandgaps of copolymers can be tailored by combining various repeat units of polymers with different bandgaps @xcite .",
    "one important approach to modify bandgaps of polyaromatics systems is to incorporate vinylene linkages between the aromatic rings @xcite .",
    "this has been demonstrated by the poly(p - phenylene vinylene ) ( ppv ) and poly(thiophene vinylene ) ( ptv ) systems , yielding bandgaps 0.3 ev lower than that of polyphenylene and polythiophene systems @xcite .",
    "the vinylene bond not only reduces the band gap of the polymer but also acts as a spacer to reduce steric hinderance on successive aromatic rings , therefore increasing the degree of coplanarity of the conjugated polymer backbone @xcite .",
    "an advantage of ptv and its derivatives is their high absorption in the visible range of the spectrum , making them excellent candidates for energy alternatives @xcite .",
    "for solar cell applications , poly(thiophene vinylene ) ( ptv ) has already proven to be an interesting conjugated polymer with a high conductivity @xcite .",
    "these polymers display high nonlinear optical responses and moderate charge mobilities @xcite .",
    "in addition , ptv has a band gap of about 1.7ev and , as a result , can be considered as a low - bandgap polymer @xcite .    optical absorption and emission spectra of conjugated polymers exhibit well pronounced peak attributed to the excitations of @xmath0 electron transitions @xcite .",
    "vibronic excitations in well - ordered polymers could be seen as additional fine structures @xcite .",
    "however , not all components of the fine structure in the optical absorption and emission spectra can be attributed to exciton - phonon coupling .",
    "it has been demonstrated earlier that the long - wavelength shoulder in optical absorption spectra of poly(3-hexylthiophene ) has different nature and it could be interpreted as the effect of interchain interaction @xcite .    due to the degree of difficulty in devising new synthesis schemes , it is important to rely on computational models which can predict the properties , since the characterization of polymers can only be done once the polymer has been successfully synthesized .",
    "a guided approach to the design of new organic materials is preferential .",
    "state - of - the - art first principle methods based on the density functional theory ( dft ) are very useful tools for providing a detailed understanding of structural , electronic , and optical processes @xcite . in this work we studied optical absorption of poly(thiophene vinylene ) ( ptv ) conjugated polymers .",
    "based on extensive first principle modeling of the ground state and optical absorption , we will demonstrate the possible coexistence of two stable geometrical phases with different interchain distances .",
    "comparison with measured experimental data show that the observed long - wavelegth optical absorption shoulder is consistent with a predicted geometrical phase with a smaller interchain distance .",
    "previous works on ppv @xcite showed that crystalline arrangement crucially affects the optical properties of the polymer films and interchain interactions can be viewed as a tunable parameter for the design of efficient electronic devices based on organic materials .",
    "3d arrangement is also a crucial element for the design of materials with efficient transport properties . in this work we studied effect of the aggregation in ptv which could be considered as an intermediate phase between liquid and solid .",
    "our goal is to understand how aggregation affects optical absorption in ptv .",
    "based on extensive first principle modeling combined with experiment we demonstrate that optical absorption spectra of ptv polymers indeed show specific features which could be interpreted as a result of interchain interaction .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way .",
    "first we describe fabrication procedure of ptv polymers and measurement conditions of optical absorption spectra . in the following section we describe theoretical methods used in this work for equilibrium geometry study and for optical calculations .",
    "in the final section we present comparative analysis of predicted and measured optical absorption spectra , supported by calculated projected density of states ( pdos ) and by equilibrium geometry studies in comparison with available data in literature .",

    "[ fig : abs_heat_sonif ] presents uv - vis heating and sonification treatment studies of regioregular ptv solutions .",
    "application of external treatment ( heating and sonification ) results in slight red shift stabilizing spectral location of optical absorption against further treatments ( see fig . [ fig : abs_heat_sonif ] ) . after the treatment of the solution we observed a dominant absorption peak located at @xmath1 accompanied by a prominent shoulder located at 619 nm ( a - shoulder ) .",
    "this shoulder was observed on all samples studied and it shows relatively weak dependence on concentration and heat - sonification treatment .",

    "we have explicitly checked that the structural and binding properties of our system are well converged for the double numerical plus polarization basis set used .",
    "the use of the exact dft spherical atomic orbitals has several advantages .",
    "for one , the molecule can be dissociated exactly to its constituent atoms ( within the dft context ) . because of the local character of these orbitals , basis set superposition effects @xcite are minimized and good accuracy is achieved even for weak bonds .",
    "solvent effects were taken into account during geometry optimization .    in order to simulate the effects of a solvent the conductor - like screening model ( cosmo ) @xcite",

    "the charge distribution of the solute polarizes the dielectric medium .",
    "the response of the dielectric medium is described by the generation of screening ( or polarization ) charges on the cavity surface .",
