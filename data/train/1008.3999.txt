    "we report here a new analysis of our cosmic - ray electron ( cre , includes positrons ) data sample , at energies between 7  gev and 1  tev based on measurements made using data from the first full year of on - orbit operations of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope s large area telescope ( lat )  @xcite .",
    "fermi was launched on june 11 , 2008 , into a circular orbit at 565 km altitude and @xmath2 inclination .",
    "this paper extends the energy range of our previous measurement  @xcite down to 7 gev , and provides more detailed information about our previous analysis based on the first six months of operations . in our earlier work",
    ", we reported that the cre spectrum between 20 gev and 1 tev has a harder spectral index ( best fit 3.04 in the case of a single power law ) than previously indicated ( in the range 3.1 to 3.4 )  @xcite , showing an excess of cres at energies above 100  gev with respect to most pre - fermi experiments .",
    "the extension down to 7 gev takes us close to the lowest geomagnetic cutoff energy accessible to the fermi satellite .",
    "this part of the spectrum is important for understanding the heliospheric transport of cres .",
    "high - energy ( @xmath3  gev ) cres lose their energy rapidly ( @xmath4 ) by synchrotron radiation on galactic magnetic fields and by inverse compton scattering on the interstellar radiation field .",
    "the typical distance over which a 1  tev cre loses half its total energy is estimated to be 300400 pc ( see e.g.  @xcite ) when it propagates within about 1 kpc of the sun .",
    "this makes them a unique tool for probing nearby galactic space .",
    "lower - energy cres are affected more readily by energy - dependent diffusive losses , convective processes in the interstellar medium , and perhaps reacceleration by second - order fermi processes during transport from their sources to us .",
    "since all these processes can affect the cre spectrum after its injection by the sources , the observed spectrum is sensitive to the environment , i.e. , to where and how electrons ( and positrons ) originate and propagate through the galaxy .",
    "recent results from the atic  @xcite , ppb - bets  @xcite , hess  @xcite , pamela  @xcite , and fermi lat  @xcite collaborations have shed new light on the origin of cres . the atic and ppb - bets teams reported evidence for an excess of electrons in the range 300700 gev compared to the background expected from a conventional homogeneous distribution of cosmic - ray ( cr ) sources . the hess team reported a spectrum that steepens above @xmath5  gev , a result which is consistent with an absence of sources of electrons above @xmath6  tev within 300400 pc .",
    "the pamela collaboration reports that the ratio of the positron flux to the total flux of electrons and positrons increases with energy  @xcite , a result which has significant implications .",
    "the majority of cr positrons ( and some electrons ) are thought to be produced via inelastic collisions between cr nuclei and interstellar gas ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for this case of secondary production ,",
    "the source spectrum for the cr positrons mirrors that of the cr nuclei and is steeper than the injection spectrum of primary cres .",
    "after propagation , the secondary cr positron spectrum remains steeper , and this should give a @xmath7 ratio that falls with energy .",
    "therefore , some additional component of cr positrons appears to be required .",
    "the fermi result either requires a reconsideration of the source spectrum and/or the propagation model or indicates the presence of a nearby source .",
    "however , the excess of events reported by atic and ppb - bets was not detected by the lat .",
    "the measurements described above disagree in their details with most previous models ( e.g.  @xcite ) in which cres were assumed , for the sake of simplicity , to be produced in sources homogeneously distributed throughout the galaxy .",
    "many recent papers have revisited the cr source modeling , exploring the possibility of nearby sources whose nature could be astrophysical ( e.g. pulsars ) or `` exotic '' ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper , we describe the procedures for event energy reconstruction , electron candidate selection , and our assessment of the instrument response functions .",
    "an important cross - check of our analysis is provided by a subset of events having longer path lengths through the calorimeter and therefore better energy resolution than the full data set .",
    "the consistency of the spectrum derived using this subset and that derived using the full data set indicates that the energy resolution assumed in our previously published work  @xcite for events @xmath8  gev is indeed adequate .",
    "finally we discuss the inferred spectrum of cr electrons and its possible interpretation .",
    "section  [ sec : approach ] describes various aspects of our analysis method .",
    "section  [ sec : spec_analysis ] contains a thorough discussion of our efforts to minimize and characterize the systematic uncertainties in the analysis .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "the lat is a pair - conversion gamma - ray telescope designed to measure gamma rays in the energy range from 20  mev to greater than 300  gev .",
    "although the lat was designed to detect photons , it was recognized very early that it would be a capable detector of high - energy electrons  @xcite .",
    "the lat is composed of a @xmath9 array of identical towers that measure the arrival direction and energy of each photon .",
    "each tower is comprised of a tracker and a calorimeter module .",
    "a tracker module has 18 @xmath10-@xmath11 planes of silicon - strip detectors , interleaved with tungsten converter foils , with a total of 1.5 radiation lengths ( x@xmath12 ) of material for normally - incident particles . in order to limit the power consumption and reduce the data volume ,",
    "the tracker information at the single - strip level is digital ( i.e. , the pulse height is not recorded ) .",
    "however , some information about the charge deposition in the silicon detectors is provided by the measurement of the time over threshold ( tot ) of the trigger signal from each of the tracker planes ; see  @xcite for further details on the architecture of the tracker electronics system .",
    "a calorimeter module with 8.6 x@xmath12 for normal incidence , has 96 csi(tl ) crystals , hodoscopically arranged in 8 layers , aligned alternately along the @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes of the instrument . a segmented anticoincidence detector ( acd ) , which tags @xmath13% of the charged particles , covers the tracker module array .",
    "the electronic subsystem includes a robust programmable hardware trigger and software filters .",
    "the description of the detector calibrations that are not covered in this paper can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the cre analysis is based on the gamma - ray analysis , as described in  @xcite .",
    "the main challenge of the analysis is to identify and separate 71000  gev electrons from all other species , mainly cr protons .",
    "the analysis involves a trade - off between the efficiency for detecting electrons and that for rejecting interacting hadrons .",
    "the high flux of cr protons and helium  @xcite compared to that of cres dictates that the hadron rejection must be @xmath14@xmath15 , increasing with energy .",
    "the development of the lat included careful and accurate monte carlo ( mc ) modeling .",
    "the details of the mc simulations are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] . to validate the responses of the instrument",
    ", we built and modeled a beam test unit using spare flight towers .",
    "this unit was subjected to comprehensive calibration data taking using beams of photons , electrons , protons and nuclei .",
    "beam - test data were compared to the results of the mc modeling , and the detector response was modified in the mc code , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : beam ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : selections ] we discuss the cuts that select the final data sample .",
    "monte carlo simulations played an essential role in the design of the lat and optimization of the data analysis .",
    "these simulations have been used to develop the electron selection algorithms to remove interacting hadron background , and to determine the instrument response functions including efficiency , effective area , and solid angle for spectral reconstruction .",
    "we generate input distributions of gamma rays and charged particles with fully configurable spatial , temporal , and spectral properties , which allow us to simulate cr particles , beam - test data , ground calibration data , and even a complete gamma - ray sky .",
    "the simulated events are fed into a detailed model of the instrument with all its materials down to individual screws as well as a simplified model of the fermi spacecraft and material below the lat .",
    "the model of the instrument and the physical interaction processes are based on the geant4  package  @xcite , widely used in high - energy physics .",
    "the details of the mc simulations for the electron analysis are given in  @xcite .",
    "the mc simulations produce both raw and processed data , include the effects of statistical processes such as landau fluctuations in energy loss , and simulate the on - board processing and trigger algorithms .",
    "output from the simulation is fed into the same reconstruction chain as data , thus producing the output quantities that can be compared with data from flight , calibration runs , beam tests , etc .    in the present analysis",
    "we have used three types of simulations : electrons only , full cr and earth albedo particle populations , and protons only . for simulating cres , other cr particles , and earth albedo particles , a model of the energetic particle populations in the fermi orbit",
    "has been developed  @xcite .",
    "the modeled fluxes of the particles were constructed using the results from cr experiments , when available .",
    "where data were missing ( e.g. , the angular distribution of albedo protons below the geomagnetic cutoff from galactic cosmic rays interacting with the atmosphere ) , published simulations were used ( e.g. see  @xcite ) .",
    "the model includes all the components of charged galactic cosmic rays ( protons , antiprotons , electrons , positrons , and nuclei up through iron ) from the lowest geomagnetic cutoff rigidity seen by the spacecraft up to 10  tev , together with reentrant and splash earth albedo particles ( neutrons , gamma rays , positrons , electrons , and protons ) within the energy range 10  mev to 20  gev ( their rates become negligible at higher energy ) .",
    "the fluxes are taken to be the same as those observed near solar minimum ( i.e. , maximum galactic cosmic - ray intensities ) , the condition that applied for the data - taking period covered in this paper .",
    "to study the effective acceptance for electrons and also to characterize the residual background from hadrons , we needed a large sample of simulated events .",
    "our total monte carlo simulations for the present analysis used approximately 400 cpus for 80 days , corresponding to @xmath16 cpu years computing time , and was the most resource - intensive part of the analysis . to enhance the number of simulated events at high energies , we often use input power - law spectra with equal numbers of counts per decade ( @xmath17 )",
    "the results then easily can be weighted to be valid for the spectral index of interest .",
    "fig_1afig_1bfig_1cfig_1d    the analysis described in this paper relies strongly on mc simulations for development of the event selection , performance parameterization , and estimation of residual background . in order to validate the simulations , a beam - test campaign was performed in 2006 on a calibration unit ( cu ) built with flight spare modules integrated into a detector consisting of two complete tracker plus calorimeter towers , an additional third calorimeter module , several anticoincidence tiles , and flightlike readout electronics .",
    "the cu was exposed to a variety of beams of photons ( up to 2.5  gev ) , electrons , hadrons ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 , a few gev100  gev ) , and ions ( c , xe , 1.5  gev / n ) over 300 different instrumental configurations at the cern and the gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research accelerator complexes  @xcite .",
    "such a large data sample allows a direct comparison with simulations over a large portion of the lat operational phase space .",
    "validations studies were conducted by systematically comparing data taken in each experimental configuration to a simulation corresponding to that configuration .",
    "distributions of the basic quantities used for event reconstruction and background rejection analysis , such as tracker clusters , calorimeter , and anticoincidence detector energy deposits and their spatial distributions , were compared .",
    "+     differences were minimized after modifying the monte carlo simulation , based on the geant4  toolkit  @xcite , to best match the data .",
    "the main changes were to improve the description of the geometry and the materials in the instrument and along the beam lines , and the models describing electromagnetic ( em ) and hadronic interactions in the detector .",
    "data were corrected for environmental effects that were found to affect the instrumental response , such as temperature drifts and beam - particle rates .",
    "we found that em processes are well described by the standard lhep libraries  @xcite , the only exception being the effect ( lpm ,  @xcite ) , which was found to be inaccurately implemented .",
    "based on our findings , this was fixed in the geant4  release itself  .",
    "the erroneous implementation produced a significant effect in the description of em cascades at energies as low as @xmath20  gev .",
    "the lat is in fact sensitive to the onset of the lpm effect , as it finely samples the longitudinal and lateral shower development .",
    "tuning the geant4  simulation of hadronic interactions to the actual instrumental response requires choosing among the many alternative cross - section algorithms and interaction models that are specific to the energy range of interest .",
    "geant4  offers such flexibility through a choice of different implementations from a list of possibilities  @xcite .",
    "we found that the simulations that best reproduce the hadronic interactions recorded in the cu are obtained when using the bertini libraries at low energies ( @xmath21 gev ) and the qgsp code at higher energies ( @xmath22 gev )  @xcite . with such models ,",
    "the agreement between data and monte carlo simulations for hadronic cascades is not perfect , but appears to be sufficient to safely estimate the residual hadronic contamination .",
    "these codes were incorporated in both the cu and lat simulations .",
    "the average values of the distributions of all basic subsystem variables are typically reproduced by the simulations to within @xmath23 for em interactions and @xmath24 for hadronic interactions ( with maximal discrepancies twice as large at the limit of instrument acceptance and for the highest energies ) . however , essential variables such as the transverse size of showers in the calorimeter , the distribution of extra clusters in the tracker , and the average time over threshold along the best track ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : btvariables ] ) are well reproduced .",
    "residual differences between the beam test data and the simulations are all included in the systematic errors evaluated according to the prescription in sec .",
    "[ sec : systematic ] .",
    "beam - test electron data were also used to validate our evaluation of the energy resolution . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : energy ] , high - energy em showers are not fully contained in the lat cu , and an evaluation of the shower fraction leaking from the cal is needed to correctly reconstruct the shower energy .",
    "the effect of the leakage correction in the energy reconstruction algorithm can be seen directly in fig .",
    "[ fig : btrecon ] , where the raw energy deposit and the reconstructed energy distributions are shown for several electron beams impacting the cu .",
    "the energy resolution derived from the peak widths is plotted on the right axis .",
    "the agreement between data and our simulations is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bteresolution ] .    after improving the simulation",
    "as described above , an important residual discrepancy between the simulation and the beam test data was found in the raw energy deposited in the cu , which was measured to be @xmath25 higher , on average , than predicted , with an asymmetric spread ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , slightly depending on the energy and incident angle .",
    "this difference was corrected in beam test data using a simple scaling factor on the cu energy measurement , thus providing a good agreement between the energy deposit along the shower axis with the monte carlo simulations , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : longemshower ] .",
    "the origin of this 9% scaling factor is unknown .",
    "it may have to do with an imperfect calibration of the cu calorimeter modules or residual effects from temperature and rates at the beam test that were not accounted for in the data analysis .",
    "further studies are now in progress with flight data .",
    "for this reason the lat data are not corrected with this scaling factor , but we include a systematic uncertainty in the lat energy scale of @xmath28 .",
    "comparison of beam - test data ( triangles ) and monte carlo simulations ( squares ) for the energy resolution for electron beams entering the cu at @xmath29 and @xmath30 and energies from 10 to 282 gev .",
    "lines connecting points are to guide an eye . ]",
    "fig_4afig_4bfig_4cfig_4d      the event selection relies on the capabilities of the tracker , calorimeter , and anticoincidence subsystems , alone and in combination to discriminate between electromagnetic and hadronic event topologies .",
    "the analysis of em showers produced in the instrument by cre and gamma rays is very similar . for event reconstruction ( track identification , energy and direction measurement , acd analysis ) and calculation of variables used in event classification we use the same reconstruction algorithms .",
    "although based on the same techniques , the selections are of course different and specific to the electron analysis . for example , the acd effectively separates charged particles from photons .",
    "it also provides information on the topologies of the event useful for separating electrons from protons .",
    "the electron analysis covers the energy range from a few gev to 1  tev while the photon analysis is currently optimized for the 100  mev300  gev range .",
    "although some fraction of hadrons can have interactions that mimic electromagnetic events , their true energies can not be evaluated event by event and are underestimated by our reconstruction algorithms . generally , the shapes of hadronic showers differ significantly from em showers .",
    "the most powerful separators are the comparative lateral distributions .",
    "electromagnetic cascades are tightly confined , while hadronic cascades that leave comparable energy in the calorimeter tend to deposit energy over a much wider lateral region affecting all three detector subsystems .",
    "the nuclear fragments tend to leave energy far from the main trajectory of the particle .",
    "thus hadron showers have larger transverse sizes in the calorimeter , larger numbers of stray tracks in the tracker , and larger energy deposits in more acd tiles .",
    "since the phenomenology of the em cascades and hadron interactions varies dramatically over the energy range of interest , we developed two independent event selections , one tuned for energies between 20 and 1000  gev and the other for energies between 0.1 and 100  gev , which we shall refer to as he  and le .",
    "the he  analysis takes advantage of the fact that the on - board filtering ( event selections designed to fit the data volume into the available telemetry bandwidth with a minimal impact on the photon yield ) is disengaged for events depositing more than 20  gev in the calorimeter .",
    "the source of data for the le  selection is an unbiased sample of all trigger types , prescaled on - board so that one out of 250 triggered events is recorded without filtering .",
    "the region of overlap in energy , between 20 and 80  gev , allows us to cross - check the two independent analyses . above about 80  gev",
    "the number of events in the prescaled sample becomes too low to be useful .",
    "fig_5afig_5bfig_5cfig_5d    the event selection process must balance removal of background events and retaining signal events , while limiting systematic uncertainties .",
    "we first reject those events that are badly reconstructed or are otherwise unusable .",
    "we require at least one reconstructed track and a minimum energy deposition ( 5  mev for le  and 1  gev for he ) and , for he  events , a pathlength longer than @xmath31 in the calorimeter .",
    "we keep only events with zenith angle @xmath32 to reduce the contribution from earth albedo particles .",
    "the next step is to select electron candidates based on the detailed event patterns in the calorimeter , the tracker , and the acd subsystems .",
    "the calorimeter plays a central role by imaging the shower and determining its trajectory .",
    "we fit both the longitudinal ( for determining energy ) and transverse shower distributions and compare them to the distributions expected for electromagnetic cascades .",
    "figure  [ fig : caltransrms_selection ] shows the sequence of four successive cuts on the data in a single energy bin , for the transverse shower size in the calorimeter .",
    "this figure illustrates the difference in transverse shower size between electrons and hadrons , and illustrates how all three lat subsystems contribute to reduce the hadron contamination .",
    "fig_6afig_6b    the tracker images the initial part of the shower . as shown earlier in fig .",
    "[ fig : btvariables ] , electrons are selected by having larger energy deposition along the track and more clusters in the vicinity ( within @xmath6  cm ) of the best track , but which do not belong to the track itself . as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : btvariables](a ) and  [ fig : btvariables](c ) , the fraction of these extra clusters is , on average , much higher for energetic electrons than for protons .",
    "the average energy deposition in the silicon planes ( which we measure by means of the time over threshold ) is also higher for electrons , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : btvariables](b ) and  [ fig : btvariables](d ) .",
    "the acd provides part of the necessary discrimination power .",
    "photons are efficiently rejected using the acd in conjunction with the reconstructed tracks . a signal in an acd tile aligned with the selected track indicates that the particle crossing the lat is charged .",
    "hadrons are removed by looking for energy deposition in all the acd tiles , mainly produced by particles backscattering from the calorimeter .",
    "two examples of this effect can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : acdenergy ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : acdenergy](a ) shows the total energy deposition in the acd tiles for the le  analysis ; the hadrons are more likely to populate the high - energy tail .",
    "figure  [ fig : acdenergy](b ) shows the average energy per tile in the he  analysis ; it is significantly higher for hadrons than for electrons , due to backsplash from nuclear cascades .",
    "a classification tree ( ct ) analysis   provides the remaining hadron rejection power necessary for the cre spectrum measurement .",
    "fig_7afig_7bfig_7cfig_7d    we identified the quantities ( variables ) derived from the event reconstructions that are most sensitive to the differences between electromagnetic and hadronic event topologies .",
    "for example , the multiplicity of tracks and the extra hits outside of reconstructed tracks is useful for rejecting interacting hadrons .",
    "variables mapping the shower development in the calorimeter are also important .",
    "the cts are trained using simulated events and , for each event , predict the probability that the event is an electron .",
    "the cut that we have adopted on the resulting ct - predicted electron probability is energy dependent . for he  analysis ,",
    "a higher probability is required as energy increases .",
    "these cuts give us a set of candidate electron events with a residual contamination of hadrons that can not be removed on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the remaining contamination must be estimated using the simulations and will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : contamination ] .",
    "though the simulations are the starting point for the event selection , we systematically compare them with the flight data as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : caltransrms_selection][fig : ctbprob_energy ] .",
    "the input energy spectra for all the particles are those included in the model of energetic particles in the fermi orbit ( sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] ) , with the exception of the electrons . for the electrons we use instead a power - law spectrum that fits our previous publication  @xcite . for any single variable we use the signal and proton background distributions at the very end of the selection chain ( after the cuts on all the other variables have been applied ) to quantify the additional rejection power provided by that particular variable .",
    "any variables for which the data - mc agreement was not satisfactory were not used in any part of the selection .",
    "the procedure used to characterize the discrepancies between data and monte carlo and quantify the associated systematic uncertainties will be described in sec .  [",
    "sec : systematic ] .",
    "we stress , however , that there is a good qualitative agreement ( both in terms of the shapes of the distributions and in terms of the relative weights of the electron and hadron populations ) in all the energy bins and at all the stages of the selection .",
    "this is a good indication of the self - consistency of the analysis and that both the cr flux model and detector simulation adequately reproduce the data .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the electron energy reconstruction is performed using the algorithms developed for the photon analysis  @xcite .",
    "these algorithms are based on comprehensive simulations and validated with the beam test data  @xcite .",
    "the total depth of the lat , including both the tracker and the calorimeter , is 10.1  x@xmath12 on axis .",
    "the average amount of material traversed by the candidate electrons , integrated over the instrument field of view , is 12.5  x@xmath12 .",
    "however , for electromagnetic cascades @xmath3  gev a significant fraction of the energy is not contained in the calorimeter . here , the calorimeter shower imaging capability is crucial in order to correct for the energy leakage from the sides and the back of the calorimeter and through the gaps between calorimeter modules .",
    "the event reconstruction is an iterative process  @xcite .",
    "the best track provides the reference axis for the analysis of the shower in the calorimeter .",
    "the energy reconstruction is completed only after the particle tracks are identified and fitted . following this procedure ,",
    "each single event is fed into three different energy reconstruction algorithms :    * a parametric correction method based on the energy centroid depth along the shower axis in the calorimeter in combination with the total energy absorbed  valid over the entire energy range for the lat ; * a maximum likelihood fit , based on the correlation between the total deposited energy , the energy deposited in the last layer of the calorimeter and the number of tracker hits  valid up to 300  gev ; and * a three - dimensional fit to the shower profile , taking into account the longitudinal and transverse development  valid above 1  gev .    for each event",
    "the best energy reconstruction method is then selected by means of a ct analysis similar to that described in sec .",
    "[ sec : selections ] .",
    "the classifier is trained on a monte carlo data sample and exploits all the available topological information to infer which energy estimate is closest to the true energy for the particular event being processed .",
    "the final stage of the energy analysis , again based on a set of cts , provides an estimate of the quality of the energy reconstruction , which we explicitly use in the analysis to reject events with poorly measured energy .",
    "fig_8afig_8b    fig_9afig_9b    at high energies ( and especially above 300  gev , where the likelihood fit is no longer available ) , the three - dimensional fit to the shower profile is the reconstruction method chosen for the vast majority of events .",
    "this method takes into account the saturation of the calorimeter readout electronics that occurs at @xmath33  gev for an individual crystal . however above @xmath6",
    "tev the number of saturated crystals increases quickly , requiring a more complex correction .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the current paper and will be addressed in subsequent publications .",
    "we therefore limit ourselves to events with energies @xmath34  tev .",
    "the performance of the energy reconstruction algorithm has been characterized across the whole energy range of interest using monte carlo simulations of an isotropic 1/e electron flux .",
    "we divided the energy range into 6 partially overlapping bins per decade and quantified the bias and the resolution in each bin , based on the resulting energy dispersion distributions ( defined as the ratio between the reconstructed energy and the true energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyrescalc ] ) .",
    "the energy dispersion distribution in each energy window is fitted with a log - normal function and the bias is calculated as the deviation of the most probable value of the fit function from 1 .",
    "this bias is smaller than @xmath35 over the entire phase space explored .",
    "we characterize the energy resolution by quoting the half - width of the smallest window containing @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the events in the energy dispersion distributions .",
    "those windows are graphically indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyrescalc ] and correspond to 1 and 2 sigma , respectively , in the ideal case of a gaussian response .",
    "the energy resolution corresponding to a @xmath36 half - width containment is about @xmath38 at 7  gev and increases as the energy increases , reaching @xmath39 at 1  tev as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eresolution ] .",
    "the @xmath37 containment is useful to quantify the tails of the distribution and is within a factor 3 of the @xmath36 containment .",
    "the deviation with respect to a gaussian distribution is mainly due to a higher probability to underestimate the energy than to overestimate it and is reflected in the low - energy tails in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyrescalc ] .",
    "we verified , with our simulations , that the energy response does not generate any discontinuity that could create spurious features in the spectrum .",
    "the instrument acceptance for electrons , or effective geometric factor ( egf ) , is defined as a product of the instrument field of view and its effective area . to calculate the egf we use a monte carlo simulation of an isotropic electron spectrum with a power - law index of @xmath40 ( the same simulation described in sec .  [",
    "sec : energy ] ) . in this case , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the number of generated events and the number of events surviving the selection cuts in the @xmath44 energy bin .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath45 depends on the area and the solid angle over which the events have been generated .",
    "the egf for le  and he   events is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geomfactor ] .",
    "the he  egf has a peak value of @xmath46 at an energy @xmath47  gev .",
    "the falloff below 50  gev is due to the on - board filtering ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : selections ] ) , while the decrease for energies above 50  gev is due to the energy dependence of the event selection .",
    "the le  egf in fig .",
    "[ fig : geomfactor ] has been multiplied by a factor of 250 for graphical clarity . for energies below 30  gev its value is almost constant while for higher energies it decreases rapidly .",
    "this effect is due to the fact that the leevent selection is optimized for relatively low energies . the statistical error on the egf is less than @xmath48 for each energy bin of the reconstructed spectrum for both le  and he .",
    "we estimate the contamination in each energy bin by applying the selection cuts to the on - orbit simulation to determine the rate of remaining background events ( protons and heavy nuclei ) .",
    "to correct for the contamination , this rate is subtracted from that of the flight electron candidates ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contamination ] for the he  analysis ) . with this procedure",
    "the contribution to the systematic uncertainty due to the residual contamination depends on the energy spectra for hadrons in our simulation and not on the one for electrons ( see sec .  [",

    "note that the le  analysis ( which is independent of the he  analysis ) deals with large variation in the event topology , especially at its low - energy end ; also it was optimized for the efficiency for electrons to compensate for lower input statistics .",

    "after applying the he  selection cuts , we determine the rate of residual proton events corresponding to a spectral index of 1 , and reweight it to derive the residual proton event rate corresponding to the real cr proton spectral index of 2.76 .",
    "we add 5% to this rate in order to take into account the contribution of heavy nuclei , mainly helium , which was not simulated .",

    ", we use the all - sky average gamma - ray flux measured by the lat and extrapolate it over the energy range of interest .",
    "we then convolve it with the effective geometric factor for gamma rays after electron selection cuts to obtain the rate of remaining gamma - ray events .",
    "the ratio of this rate to the measured event rate provides an estimate of the gamma contamination , which remains below 0.1% over the whole energy range .",
    "once we have the rate of electrons , the spectrum is found by dividing the event rate by the egf ( described in sec .",
    "[ sec : geomfactor ] ) and the width of the energy interval .",
    "the energy dispersion ( which causes events to migrate to adjacent bins ) is taken into account by unfolding the background - subtracted rate with a technique based on bayes theorem  @xcite .",
    "the event migration is calculated using a matrix based on the energy dispersion obtained from simulations .",
    "we found that this correction is less than 5% in all the energy intervals .",
    "the reconstruction procedure is similar for both the le  and the he  analyses .",
    "the former is more complicated due to the presence of the earth s magnetic field .",
    "in fact , for energies below @xmath20  gev we need to consider the shielding effect of the geomagnetic field as characterized by the cutoff rigidity .",
    "the lowest allowed primary - electron energy is strongly dependent on geomagnetic position and decreases with increasing geomagnetic latitude . for the orbit of fermi",
    ", the cutoff ranges between about 6 and 15  gev .",
    "as recognized in  @xcite , the mcilwain l   parameter is particularly convenient for characterizing cutoff rigidities and has been used for selecting data in the le  analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : mcilwainlvsrigidity ] illustrates the distribution of the mcilwain l parameter for the fermi orbit .",
    "we want to stress here that the contours shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcilwainlvsrigidity ] are the vertical cutoff rigidities based on the international geomagnetic reference field ( igrf ) model  @xcite and are intended for illustrative purposes only .",
    "our analysis does not depend in any way on the vertical cutoff values from this model .",
    "each mcilwain l interval has an associated cutoff ; we determine @xmath52 by parameterizing the shape of the cre spectrum as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the normalization constants for the secondary ( albedo ) and primary components of the spectrum while @xmath56 and @xmath57 are their spectral indexes .",
    "figure  [ fig : fluxfitted ] illustrates how we determine @xmath52 using eq .",
    "[ eq : spectrum_function ] for three mcilwain l intervals .      as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxfitted ] , the transition to cutoff is smoothed out due to the complexity of the particle orbits in the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "therefore , we increase @xmath52 by @xmath39 to arrive at an effective minimum energy of the primary electron flux not affected by the earth s magnetic field . to verify that this increase is sufficient",
    ", we have performed a series of tests to quantify the changes in the flux level as a function of this parameter and found that the final spectrum does not vary significantly for values greater than 15% .",
    "we split the le  data sample into 10 intervals of mcilwain l parameter . for each energy bin",
    "we use the interval of mcilwain l parameter whose effective minimum energy is lower than the energy in question . this procedure",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxoverlap ] , where the electron spectrum is shown together with the mcilwain l intervals from which the flux was measured .",
    "the electron flux below the geomagnetic cutoff is due to secondary electrons produced in the earth atmosphere including reentrance albedo .",
    "discussion of the spectrum below the cutoff is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the imperfect knowledge of the egf constitutes one of the main sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the simulations we use for the evaluation of the egf can not perfectly reproduce the topological variables used in the electron selection .",
    "differences between data and simulation may affect the flux measurement also through the subtraction of the hadronic background , but this contribution is relatively easier to keep under control because the contamination itself is always under 20% . in order to characterize the agreement between simulations and data , and assess the effect of the residual discrepancies",
    ", we systematically studied the variations of the measured flux induced by changes in the selection cuts around the optimal values .",
    "if the agreement were perfect the flux would not depend on the cut values .",
    "however , this is in general not true and such changes translate into systematically higher or lower flux values .    consider a variable for which we wish to know the effect of changing cut values .",
    "we first apply all other cuts , and then vary the cut value on this variable and study the effects .",
    "the procedure we used is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_scan ] for one variable in one energy bin .",
    "panel  [ fig : flux_scan](a ) shows how the geometric factor and the measured flux depend on the cut value . in this particular case",
    "a harsher cut translates into a systematically higher flux .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood by looking at the comparison between data and monte carlo simulation for the distribution of the average energy per acd tile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acdenergy](b ) .",
    "the distribution of this quantity in our simulation is slightly shifted toward higher energies with respect to the flight data and therefore , for any given cut , we effectively tend to underestimate the egf ( i.e. , overestimate the flux ) .",
    "it is important to note that this variable is directly related to the topology of the backsplash in the acd , which is extremely hard to simulate , especially at very high energies .",
    "we found that the scatter plot of the measured flux vs the geometric factor , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_scan](b ) , can be fitted reasonably well with a straight line in all the cases we encountered ( the slope returned by the fit being directly related to the agreement between monte carlo and flight data ) .",
    "the fit function is used to determine the difference between the flux at the selected cut value and that measured when the cut is loose enough that the variable under study no longer contributes to the selection .",
    "we take this difference [ @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_scan](b ) ] as the estimate of the systematic effect introduced by the variable itself . for the case illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_scan ] it is 7% and represents the largest single contribution , among all the selection variables , to the total systematic error in this energy bin .    the method described here is sensitive to differential discrepancies around the cut values for both signal and background and allows us to map them to the actual measured spectrum .",
    "it has been performed separately for each energy bin and each selection variable ( setting the cuts for all the other variables to the optimal values ) .",
    "positive ( negative ) contributions , corresponding to variables for which the slope of the fit is negative ( positive ) are summed up in quadrature separately to provide an asymmetric bracketing of systematic uncertainty .",
    "the error on the absolute normalization of the background flux ( predominantly protons ) constitutes an additional source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "we conservatively assumed a constant value of 20% , which is properly weighted with the residual contamination ( sec .",
    "[ sec : contamination ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute energy scale of the detector is also a significant contribution to the systematic error on the measurement . assuming that this uncertainty @xmath59 is energy - independent ( as the results of our beam test indicate ) it translates into a rigid shift of the overall spectrum . for a given spectral index @xmath60 the vertical component of this shift",
    "is given by @xmath61 ( i.e. , is 20% for an uncertainty of 10% on the absolute energy scale and a spectral index @xmath62 ) .    the simulated data sample used for the evaluation of the geometric factor and the residual contamination is large enough that any effect due to statistical fluctuations is negligible in both the le  and the heanalysis .",
    "this is not true for the analysis with sampled statistics presented in sec .",

    "check the impact of the energy resolution on the measured spectrum , we performed a dedicated analysis in which we selected events with the longest path lengths ( at least  @xmath63 ) in the calorimeter .",
    "we further select events that do not cross any of the boundary gaps between calorimeter tower modules and that have sufficient track length ( at least  @xmath64 ) in the tracker for a good direction reconstruction . for the event sample defined by these three requirements",
    "the average amount of material traversed is @xmath65    distribution of the amount of material traversed by the candidate electrons passing the long path selection , compared with that for the entire data sample used in the standard analysis ( the sharp edge at @xmath66 in the latter reflects the total thickness of the instrument on - axis ) .",
