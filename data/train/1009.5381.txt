    "modelling the early evolution of star cluster systems provides crucial insights into cluster formation physics through a comparison between predicted and observed correlations and distribution functions of individual cluster properties . over the past 30 years",
    ", considerable efforts have been dedicated to modelling cluster violent relaxation , i.e. cluster evolution after residual star forming gas expulsion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , cluster @xmath0-body model grids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allow to model entire star cluster systems while browsing the parameter space extensively .",
    "initial conditions of star cluster systems constitute crucial ingredients of their time - evolution modelling , and the mass - radius relation of cluster - forming cores is therefore an issue at the forefront of the physics of both cluster formation and cluster evolution .    in an influential study of galactic molecular clouds and of the density enhancements",
    "they contain , @xcite find that molecular clouds and their cores are in approximate virial equilibrium and have a near constant surface density .",
    "these properties were then included by @xcite in their model of formation of old globular clusters , whose birth sites are identified as the dense cores of ` supergiant molecular clouds ' at the early protogalactic epoch .",
    "constant surface density cluster - forming cores show a strong mass - radius relation @xmath7 , which contrasts with the absence of a clear mass - radius relation for gas - free star clusters , regardless of their age @xcite .",
    "@xcite therefore suggests that cluster - forming cores themselves have uncorrelated masses and radii .",
    "such an hypothesis has a bearing on the time - evolution of the mass function of clusters from the embedded phase to the end of violent relaxation . owing to their deeper potential well ,",
    "massive cores undergo more adiabatic gas expulsion and , therefore , retain a greater fraction of their stars .",
    "@xcite show that this can account for the formation of a turnover in the cluster mass function at young ages .",
    "@xcite and @xcite further that hypothesis and show that cluster - forming cores with constant radii indeed produce features ( flattening or turnover ) in the cluster mass function provided that the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , assumed to be mass - independent , is not higher than 30 per cent",
    ". these studies mostly aim at explaining the prominent and universal turnover characterizing the mass function of old globular clusters ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the mass function of young star clusters in the present - day universe is reported to be a featureless power - law of spectral index of about @xmath8 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , irrespective of the cluster age ( say , 1 , 10 or 100myr ) .",
    "this implies that cluster infant weight - loss ( i.e. the gas - expulsion - driven cluster star - loss ) is independent of the embedded - cluster mass .",
    "recently , @xcite have estimated that the sfe required for a cluster - forming core to expel its gas via stellar feedback is mass - independent if cluster - forming cores have a constant surface density .",
    "their model assumes that the gas expulsion time - scale in units of a core crossing time , @xmath1 , is constant . while preserving the shape of the cluster mass function at young ages , such a finding leaves unanswered the question of why young star clusters are deprived of a significant mass - radius relation if the mass - radius relation of their progenitors scales as @xmath7 .    in this contribution",
    "we are adding one more piece to this intriguing puzzle .",
    "previous studies @xcite have ignored the influence that an external tidal field may exert upon clusters experiencing violent relaxation .",
    "most cluster stars venturing beyond the cluster tidal radius become unbound field stars . therefore ,",
    "as a cluster expands following gas expulsion , its infant weight - loss and its likelihood of disruption are partly governed by how deeply the embedded cluster sits within its limiting tidal radius , that is , how severe tidal overflow due to cluster expansion is .",
    "@xcite performs @xmath0-body simulations highlighting this effect : infant weight - loss of otherwise identical model clusters is stronger closer to the galactic centre by virtue of the stronger tidal field and hence smaller cluster tidal radius ( his fig .  3 ) .",
    "@xcite quantify this effect by the ratio of the half - mass radius @xmath9 to the tidal radius @xmath10 of the embedded cluster . if @xmath11 , the cluster has much space in which to expand following gas expulsion , the tidal field impact is low and cluster infant weight - loss is solely driven by the sfe and the gas expulsion time - scale @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath12 , @xcite find that protoclusters are mostly disrupted .",
    "we refer to @xmath13 as the tidal field _ impact_. as we shall see in section  [ sec : tf ] , not only is it related to the external tidal field , it also depends on the embedded cluster mass and size and , therefore , to the cluster - forming core mass - radius relation .",
    "it is therefore crucial to quantify to what extent the mass - radius relation of cluster - forming cores combined to an external tidal field influences the early evolution of star cluster systems . in this introductory paper , we focus our attention on the fraction of stars which remains bound to their parent clusters at the end of violent relaxation .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : tf ] investigates how different cluster - forming core mass - radius relations ( constant radius , constant volume density and constant surface density ) influence the cluster bound fraction as a function of core mass .",
    "we also show how the mass - radius diagram of cluster - forming cores can be used to estimate whether an external tidal field influences cluster violent relaxation or not . to what extent mass - size data - sets of dense molecular gas regions",
    "can help us constrain the cluster - forming core mass - radius relation is the topic of section  [ sec : obs ] . in section  [ sec : conseq ] , we comment about the importance of the core mass - radius relation regarding crucial issues such as cluster infant mortality / weight - loss as a function of cluster mass , and the reconstruction of the star formation history of galaxies based on their surviving clusters .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "at the end of its violent relaxation ( age @xmath6myr ; see section  [ subsec : vrd ] ) , the mass of a star cluster is @xmath14 with @xmath15 the mass of the cluster progenitor core and @xmath16 the fraction of stars remaining bound to the cluster at the end of violent relaxation .",
    "sfe is the ` local ' star formation efficiency , namely , the mass fraction of gas turned into stars at the onset of gas expulsion .",
    "cluster infant weight - loss , @xmath17 , is a sensitive function of the sfe at the onset of gas expulsion and of the gas expulsion time - scale expressed in units of a cluster - forming core crossing - time , @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the higher the sfe , the slower the gas expulsion time - scale @xmath1 , the higher the bound fraction @xmath16(sfe,@xmath1 ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rather than on the local sfe .",
    "that is , @xmath18 .",
    "the esfe incorporates how far from virial equilibrium the cluster is at the onset of gas expulsion .",
    "if the stars and gas are in virial equilibrium at the onset of gas expulsion as a result of , for instance , a several - crossing - time time - span between star formation and gas expulsion , the esfe is simply the ` local ' sfe and @xmath19 .",
    "this is the approach we adopt in this contribution since the assumption of virial equilibrium underpins the @xmath0-body model grid of @xcite ( and the vast majority of other studies dedicated to cluster gas expulsion ) .",
    "however , if the dynamical state of the newly - formed stars at the onset of gas expulsion is ` cold ' , then the @xmath20 is higher than the local sfe , and the bound fraction @xmath16 becomes larger than shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fb ] , [ fig : disc ] , [ fig : adiab ] and [ fig : fb0p03 ] ( and the opposite if stars are in a ` hot ' dynamical state ) .",
    "cluster models in which stars are not in virial equilibrium at gas expulsion have been investigated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note however that if the cold collapse at gas expulsion stems from stars forming out of a contracting pre - cluster core , this implies that the star - formation activity in the pre - cluster cloud core would need to be synchronised to occur within a time shorter than the core crossing - time and so @xmath21 is most likely ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "in addition to the sfe and gas expulsion time - scale , the bound fraction @xmath16 may also depend on the tidal field impact @xmath13 , i.e. : @xmath22 an effect mapped by @xcite by means of cluster @xmath0-body modelling .",

    "if cluster - forming cores have a constant surface density , more massive clusters evolve more slowly than their low - mass counterparts owing to their lower volume density , hence longer crossing - time .",
    "in contrast , if cluster - forming cores have a constant radius , more massive clusters have a higher density , thus shorter crossing - time and the duration of their violent relaxation ( in units of myr ) is shorter ( see fig .  1 in @xcite for an application to the time - evolution of the cluster mass function ) .",
    "constant volume density cores are all characterised by the same crossing - time and , thus , evolve at the same rate through violent relaxation regardless of their mass .",
    "if the mean number density of cluster - forming cores is @xmath272 , @xmath273 and all cluster stars due to become unbound owing to gas expulsion have crossed the tidal radius boundary by a cluster age of at most @xmath274 ( see fig .  4 in * ? ? ? * ) or 45myr . if the core mean number density is 10 times higher , @xmath172 , then @xmath275 , implying that violent relaxation is over by an age of @xmath276myr .",
    "the core mass - radius relation is also relevant to self - enrichment models of old globular clusters , in which the cluster - forming core is often referred to as a ` protoglobular cloud ' .",
    "blue populations of globular clusters in elliptical galaxies show a ` blue - tilt ' , i.e. brighter clusters are redder than their fainter counterparts .",
    "this colour - magnitude relation is often interpreted as the imprint of the higher efficiency of more massive clusters to retain type ii supernova ejecta and to achieve greater metallicity .",
    "it must be borne in mind , however , that such a conclusion sensitively depends on the slope of the core mass - radius relation .",
    "while @xcite infer a positive slope for their predicted mass - metallicity relation , @xcite predict that _ less _ massive clusters are more metal - rich .",
    "this discrepancy arises because of different assumed core mass - radius relations .",
    "@xcite build on either constant protoglobular cloud radii or constant protoglobular cloud volume densities . on the other hand",
    ", the model of @xcite , applied to the galactic old halo globular cluster system and developed before the ` blue - tilt ' in ellipticals was discovered , builds on pressure - bounded isothermal spheres for which @xmath277 .",
    "their conclusion that less massive clusters are more metal - rich arises because type ii supernova ejecta mix with a lower amount of primordial gas .",
    "contrasting the models of @xcite and @xcite therefore illustrates that the slope of the globular cluster mass - metallicity relation predicted by self - enrichment models is a sensitive function of the assumed protoglobular cloud mass - radius relation .",
    "we have investigated how the cluster - forming core mass - radius relation influences the resilience of clusters to an external tidal field during their violent relaxation , namely , while they dynamically respond to the expulsion of their residual star - forming gas . owing to their high volume densities ( @xmath278 ) , observed galactic cluster - forming cores are virtually ` immune ' to the external tidal field arising from an isothermal galactic halo with a circular velocity @xmath279 . following gas expulsion , however , clusters experience a severe density decrease through spatial expansion and star - loss ( cluster infant weight - loss ) .",
    "this renders expanded gas - free clusters more vulnerable to an external tidal field , possibly enhancing their infant weight - loss and likelihood of dissolution compared to clusters evolving in a tidal - field - free environment .    to assess the impact of the core mass - radius relation on this issue , we have built on the @xmath0-body model grid of @xcite , which provides the bound fraction @xmath16 of stars in clusters at the end of violent relaxation as a function of core sfe , gas expulsion time - scale @xmath1 ( in units of a core crossing - time @xmath195 ) and tidal field impact @xmath13 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the half - mass radius and tidal radius of the embedded cluster , respectively . assuming a given external tidal field , sfe and gas expulsion time - scale , we have estimated the bound fraction @xmath16 as a function of the mass of cluster progenitor cores for various core mass - radius relations @xmath280",
    "we have considered the cases of constant core surface density ( @xmath281 ) , constant core volume density ( @xmath282 ) and constant core radius ( @xmath283 ) , which we refer to the @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 models . for each slope",
    "@xmath60 , we have tested two different normalizations @xmath61 , which we refer to the ` compact ' and ` loose ' models ( see table  [ tbl : mrr ] ) .",

    "these cores are sometimes void of ysos .",
    "in contrast , compact models describe dense molecular cores selected for their star - formation activity .",
    "the compact core mass - radius relations therefore constitute a better proxy to cluster - formation conditions than their loose counterparts .",
    "we have shown that constant surface density cores and constant radius cores result in the preferential removal of high- and low - mass clusters , respectively .",
    "in contrast , constant volume density cores robustly lead to mass - independent cluster infant weight - loss ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fb ] ) .",
    "this is because constant surface density cores are characterised by a decreasing volume density  hence growing vulnerability to an external tidal field  with increasing core mass , while the oppposite is true for constant radius cores ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crr ] ) .",
    "building on the compact mass - radius relations ( @xmath160 , @xmath284 and @xmath285 ) , these results are further quantified . at a galactocentric distance @xmath286kpc in an isothermal galactic halo with a circular velocity @xmath105",
    ", constant surface density cores preclude the formation of bound clusters more massive than a few @xmath287 as a result of the greater vulnerability of more massive cores to the external tidal field .",
    "in contrast , the tidal field impact for constant volume density cores is independent of their mass and weak , that is , these cores respond to gas expulsion as if evolving in a tidal - field - free environment ( see figs  [ fig : rhrt ] , [ fig : fb ] and [ fig : crr ] ) .",
    "the presence of massive star clusters ( @xmath288 ) in the old haloes of elliptical and spiral galaxies , as well as in starbursts and galaxy mergers , may therefore constitute a hint that cluster - progenitor cores are not characterised by a constant surface density . besides , almost all of the cluster - forming cores in the middle and bottom panels of fig .",

    "very massive molecular cores whose mean surface density is @xmath179 are not that dense . for instance , the mean number density of a core of mass @xmath260 and surface density @xmath179 is @xmath290 only .",
    "therefore , such cores may not result in the formation of massive clusters because of inefficient star formation in the first place .",
    "the shape of the mass function of young clusters is reported to be invariant through violent relaxation ( albeit with a declining amplitude ) , which points to mass - independent cluster infant weight - loss . in that respect ,",
    "our analysis supports the hypothesis that cluster - forming cores have a constant volume density .",
    "when the sfe and gas expulsion time - scale are constant , cores of constant surface density produce mass - independent infant weight - loss for specific conditions only : the core mass range upper limit must be such that @xmath111 . this can be obtained either through a weak tidal field ( i.e. large @xmath10 ) and/or a high surface density ( to decrease @xmath9 ) , and/or a small upper limit on the core mass range as for observed molecular cores in our galaxy ( fig .",

    "as long as the core mass - radius relation stands below @xmath292 , the tidal field impact is weak to non - existent .",
    "as @xmath13 increases , cluster infant weight - loss becomes larger ( see also figs  [ fig : rhrt ] and [ fig : fb ] ) .",
    "when @xmath293-@xmath294 , clusters survive only if the sfe is high and the gas expulsion time - scale slow ( e.g. @xmath295 and @xmath296 when @xmath297 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because high sfe and slow gas expulsion dampen the spatial expansion of an exposed cluster , thereby increasing its volume density and resilience to an external tidal field .",
