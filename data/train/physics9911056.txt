    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new application of dimensional continuation to physical problems that involve simultaneously both short - distance , ultraviolet processes and long - distance , infrared processes . such problems typically involve a logarithm of a large ratio of two different scales . although the overall coefficient of the logarithm is usually easy to compute , the constant under the logarithm is often difficult to find .",
    "our new method makes the computation of this constant under the logarithm easy .",
    "we shall illustrate the simplicity of the method and its wide range of applicability by using it to solve two very diverse physical problems , the @xmath0 energy loss of a fast particle traversing a fully ionized , but non - relativistic dilute plasma and the lamb shift of hydrogen - like atoms .",
    "we shall first work out the energy loss problem in some detail because it involves rather elementary physics , and a self - contained exposition can be presented within a short space .",
    "the plasma example also does share some common features with relativistic plasmas such as those that appear in qcd and weak interaction physics .",
    "indeed , this simple problem serves as a useful test of the validity of methods used in those more complex problems . in this regard",
    ", it should be noted that although our non - relativistic , abelian example is conceptionally simpler than those in the relativistic , non - abelian gauge theory , the non - relativistic plasma involves a debye length and a plasma frequency that are quite distinct parameters while , in the extreme relativistic theory , these parameters become essentially the same ( in lowest - order perturbation theory . ) thus a verification of the treatment of different physical processes may be more difficult in the relativistic theory , and the non - relativistic case may well serve as a quite useful testing bed for methods used in the relativistic case . here",
    "our aim is to explain our method , and although we shall re - derive results that have been obtained before , the derivations will clearly describe and illustrate the power of the method .",
    "it has been applied recently to plasma energy - loss problems in which the constants under the logarithms were not known @xcite , @xcite .",
    "dimensional regularization is widely employed in relativistic quantum field theory to make otherwise divergent expressions finite and well behaved , and then to implement the renormalization procedure .",
    "it should be emphasized that here we are making use of a different and novel application of continuation to spatial dimensions @xmath6 to compute results that are always well - defined and finite at the physical @xmath5 dimension .",
    "we are not using dimensional continuation to render infinities finite so as to perform renormalizations as one does in quantum field theory .",
    "moreover , our purpose here is to introduce and describe this new application of dimensional continuation by two very different but well - known physical problems in order to illustrate its range of application .",
    "what is new is the method .",
    "it is worth first illustrating our method with a trivial mathematical example , the behavior of the modified hankel function @xmath7 in the small argument @xmath8 limit with the index @xmath1 also small .",
    "the argument @xmath8 will play the role of the small parameter in our work below ; the index @xmath1 will play the role of the dimensionality except that in this simple bessel function example we shall examine the region where @xmath1 is near zero , not three . in general , the hankel function has the integral representation @xmath9 although @xmath10 is simply a dummy integration variable , it is convenient to think of it as a wave number or momentum variable .",
    "when @xmath8 is small , @xmath11 may be replaced by @xmath12 except when one or the other of the factors @xmath13 or @xmath14 is needed to make the @xmath10 integration converge in the neighborhood of one of its end points .",
    "when @xmath1 is slightly less than zero , the integral ( [ int ] ) is dominated by the small @xmath10 , `` infrared or long - distance '' , region . in this case , only the @xmath15 factor is needed to provide convergence , and we have @xmath16 the variable change @xmath17 places this integral in the form of the standard representation of the gamma function , and we thus find that the leading term for small @xmath8 in the region @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is euler s constant . note that the second line describes the behavior for @xmath21 near @xmath22 including the correct finite constant as well as the singular pole term .    when @xmath1 is slightly greater than zero , the integral ( [ int ] )",
    "is dominated by the large @xmath10 , `` ultraviolet or short - distance '' regions . in this case",
    ", only the @xmath13 factor is needed to provide convergence , and we have @xmath23 the integral again defines a gamma function , and so @xmath24 with again the result containing the correct finite constant as well as the singular pole term .    the result ( [ small ] ) for @xmath25 can be analytically continued into the region @xmath26 .",
    "in this region it involves a higher power of @xmath8 than that which appears in the other evaluation ( [ big ] ) , and hence this analytic continuation of the leading result for @xmath25 into the region @xmath27 becomes sub - leading here .",
    "similarly , the result ( [ big ] ) for @xmath28 may be analytically continued into the region @xmath21 where it now becomes sub - leading .",
    "an examination of the defining integral representation ( [ int ] ) shows that these sub - leading analytic continuation terms are , in fact , the dominant , first - subleading terms . ) for @xmath21 from the integral representation ( [ int ] ) gives @xmath29 \\",
    ", e^{- z / ( 2k ) } \\,.\\ ] ] for @xmath30 , the integral on the right - hand - side of the equation converges when the the final exponential factor in the integrand is replaced by unity , the @xmath31 limit of this factor .",
    "hence this final factor may be omitted in the evaluation of the first sub - leading term .",
    "a partial integration presents the result as @xmath32 whose evaluation gives precisely the analytic continuation of the leading term ( [ big ] ) for @xmath33 . ] for @xmath33 one term is leading and the other subleading , while for @xmath21 their roles are interchanged .",
    "thus their sum @xmath34 -   \\left ( { z \\over 2 } \\right)^{\\nu } \\left [ 1 + \\nu \\gamma \\right ]    \\right\\ } \\label{about}\\ ] ] contains both the leading and the first subleading terms for both @xmath33 and @xmath25 . in the limit",
    "@xmath35 the ( `` infrared '' and `` ultraviolet '' ) pole terms in this sum cancel , with the variation of the residues of the poles producing a logarithm , yielding the familiar small @xmath8 result @xmath36 it must be emphasized that the correct constant terms [ @xmath37 are obtained by this method in addition to the logarithm @xmath38 which is large for small @xmath8 .",
    "the result ( [ about ] ) was derived from the analytic continuation of results that were easy to compute in one or the another region where either `` infrared '' or `` ultraviolet '' terms dominated .",
    "this is the essence of our method . of course , the general result ( [ about ] )",
    "could be obtained by a more careful computation of both the leading and first - subleading terms in either of the separate @xmath33 or @xmath39 regions as was done in the previous footnote . in some of the physical examples that we shall work out",
    ", such an extraction of the subdominant terms would be very difficult indeed , although possible in principle .",
    "thus our method acquires real power for the physical problems .    in the physical examples described below , one could object that we do not explicitly prove that larger subleading terms are not present . in the limit of the typical small parameter @xmath40 that concerns us ( with now @xmath41 ) , for our physical examples we shall find ( after extracting some overall factor of @xmath8 ) leading terms of order @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "one may then ask if an additional term that has a power dependence between @xmath44 and @xmath42 can appear .",
    "however , simple dimensional analysis shows that such terms of intermediate order can not appear .",
    "the point is that these physical examples involve only two different physical mechanisms that dominate at large and small scales , and that the two different mechanisms involve different combinations of the basic physical parameters and hence give quite different dependencies on the small parameter when the dimension @xmath1 departs from @xmath46 .",
    "incidentally , it should go without saying that the physical examples that we shall study have a basic theoretical description that is valid for a range of spatial dimensions @xmath1 about @xmath5 .",
    "the usual method for obtaining the energy loss for a charged particle moving through matter is to divide the calculation into two parts : the long - distance , soft collisions and the short - distance , hard collisions .",
    "collective effects are important in the long - distance part , and it is evaluated from the @xmath47 power loss of a particle moving in a dielectric medium .",
    "the hard collisions are described by coulomb scattering .",
    "the rub is to join the disparate pieces together . for the case of classical scattering , this is often done by computing the energy loss in coulomb scattering out to some impact parameter , and then adding the @xmath47 energy loss for all larger impact parameters .",
    "although such methods do yield the correct large logarithm without much difficulty , the logarithm of the ratio of the two scales which is large , the purely numerical constants ( which one expects to be of order one ) that accompany the logarithm are harder to compute . here",
    "we describe an easily applied method that yields a unique result  the result including the constants in addition to the large logarithm .",
    "the new idea is to compute the energy loss from coulomb scattering over all angles , but for dimensions @xmath4 where there are no infrared divergences .",
    "a separate calculation of the energy loss using the @xmath48 heating is done for @xmath3 , where the volume integration may be extended down to the particle s position without encountering an ultraviolet divergence .",
    "both of these results have a simple pole at @xmath5 , but they both may be analytically continued beyond their initial range of validity . in their original domain of dimension @xmath1 ,",
    "both calculations are performed to the leading order in the plasma density . as will be seen ,",
    "although the coulomb scattering result is the leading order contribution for @xmath4 , it is of subleading order when @xmath3 .",
    "conversely , the @xmath48 heating is subleading for @xmath4 but leading for @xmath49 .",
    "hence , the sum of the two ( analytically continued ) processes gives the leading and ( first ) subleading terms in the plasma density for all dimensions @xmath1 , and thus , in the limit of this sum at @xmath5 , the pole terms must cancel with the remainder yielding the correct physical limit to leading order in the plasma density .",
    "the fully ionized , classical plasma with which we are concerned is described exactly by a coupled set of kinetic equations , the well - known bbgky hierarchy as described , for example , in section 3.5 of ref .",
    "we are interested , however , in the computation to leading order in the plasma density of the energy loss of a fast particle traversing the plasma .",
    "the correct equations that govern the leading order low - density behavior change as the spatial dimensionality @xmath1 changes . for @xmath3 , the long - distance ,",
    "collective effects dominate , and the formula derived by lenard and balescu applies @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this formula describes the interaction of the various species that the plasma may contain . in the limit",
    "in which one species is very dilute , as is our case in which we examine the motion of a single , fast `` test particle '' moving through the plasma , the energy lost in the particle motion is described by its @xmath47 joule heating with the background plasma response given by the permittivity of a collisionless plasma . on the other hand , when the spatial dimension @xmath1 is greater than @xmath2 , the short - distance , hard coulomb collisions dominate .",
    "for these dimensions , the leading low density limit of the bbgky hierarchy is described by the familiar boltzmann equation .",
    "the boltzmann equation is derived , for example , also in section 3.5 of ref .",
    "we use the boltzmann equation to obtain the leading order energy loss rate when @xmath4 . again , since we are concerned with the motion of a single , fast `` test particle '' , the boltzmann equation reduces to the product of the energy loss weighted cross section times the plasma density . the derivations that we have just described , which start from first principles , justify the methods outlined in the previous paragraph , the methods that we shall use .",
    "since we are only interested in describing the new method , we simplify the discussion by treating only the electrons in a classical plasma ( electron recoil gives the dominant energy loss since they are light ) , and by taking the moving projectile velocity @xmath50 to be much larger than the electron velocities in the plasma so that the latter may be neglected relative to @xmath50 .",
    "we shall assume , however , that the projectile velocity is small in comparison with the velocity of light so that this particle produces a simple coulomb field ( as modified by the plasma ) and that non - relativistic mechanics applies .",
    "we first compute the @xmath51 heating with @xmath52 .",
    "the electric field @xmath53 is produced by the point projectile of charge @xmath54 moving with velocity @xmath55 which gives the charge density @xmath56 in our non - relativistic limit , the electric field is curl free while @xmath57 , and so @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the wavenumber and frequency dependent electric permittivity of the plasma .",
    "note that we use rationalized gaussian units so that electrostatic potential of a point charge in three dimensions has the form @xmath60 .",
    "since the current of the projectile is given by @xmath61 , this energy loss mechanism gives @xmath62 , or @xmath63 the electric permittivity is the boundary value of an analytic function , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 an even function of @xmath67 which also depends only on the modulus @xmath68 of @xmath69 ( by rotational invariance ) .",
    "[ this is demonstrated in the explicit form ( [ fullfn ] ) below . ]",
    "thus , in view of the factor @xmath70 which extracts the odd part of the rest of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ jjoule ] ) , we may write this energy loss as @xmath71 in which @xmath72 denotes the imaginary part .    for our calculation to leading order in the plasma density",

    ", , \\label{fullfn}\\ ] ] where the @xmath74 in the denominator corresponds to a retarded response , and where @xmath75 is the electron number density , and @xmath76 is the mass of the electron .",
    "since we are examining the limit in which the projectile is moving very rapidly with respect to the average thermal velocity of the electrons , the electron motion in the plasma may neglected .",
    "this corresponds to setting @xmath77 in the remainder of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ fullfn ] ) , which gives @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the plasma frequency for the electrons defined by @xmath80 with @xmath81 , two length scales appear , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "it is easy to check that the scale for the wave number integration in the energy loss ( [ joule ] ) ( with , of course , @xmath3 ) is set by the former , classical length .",
    "hence the latter quantum length appears as a correction involving the dimensionless parameter @xmath84 . since @xmath85 is proportional to the electron density , and we are working to leading order in this density , we must omit this small parameter and use the purely classical limit @xmath86    this is the limit to be used in the energy loss ( [ joule ] ) . in this limit , @xmath87 hence , performing the integration over the component of @xmath69 parallel to @xmath55 , and writing @xmath88 gives @xmath89 exponentiating the denominator via @xmath90 interchanging integrals , performing the resulting @xmath91 gaussian @xmath10 integrals , and recognizing the final @xmath92 integral as a standard representation of the @xmath93 function gives @xmath94 or , with the neglect of terms which vanish when @xmath41 , @xmath95 the pole in this expression , which becomes negative when @xmath96 , corresponds to the ultraviolet divergence which appears when @xmath97 in the wavenumber integral ( [ wnint ] ) .",
    "we turn now to the @xmath4 case where the energy loss is computed by single - particle scattering . by the conservation of energy ,",
    "the energy loss in the scattering of the projectile velocity @xmath98 on electrons whose initial velocity may be neglected is @xmath99 =   { m_e \\over 2 } \\ , { v_e'}^2 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the speed of the scattered electron .",
    "since the initial electron has negligible momentum , this can be written in the invariant form @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the electron momentum transfer in the scattering process . with the initial electron at rest ,",
    "the differential rate of scattering is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the electron density in the plasma and @xmath105 is the cross section element . since @xmath88 , the energy loss for @xmath4",
    "is given by @xmath106    we first evaluate this scattering contribution when the interaction is weak , when @xmath107 . in this case , the quantum - mechanical born approximation result is appropriate with , in @xmath4 dimensions , @xmath108 here @xmath109 defines the reduced mass @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the relative velocity between the electron and the projectile . writing @xmath112 and @xmath113 with @xmath114^{\\nu -2 } \\ , , $ ] and noting that the solid angle @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 we get , on setting @xmath117 , @xmath118 the integral which appears here has the value @xmath119 as one can show by dividing it into two parts with a suitable partial integration or by expressing it in terms of the standard integral representation of the beta function .",
    "since we neglect the motion of the initial electron , the relative velocity @xmath111 may be replaced by the projectile velocity @xmath50 , and so using the result in eq .",
    "( [ scatt ] ) gives @xmath120 the pole in this expression , which becomes negative when @xmath52 , corresponds to the infrared divergence of the momentum integral ( [ cross ] ) in the @xmath41 limit .",
    "when the result ( [ qabove ] ) is added to that in eq .",
    "( [ below ] ) the divergent pole terms cancel , and the physical limit @xmath121 is @xmath122 for small @xmath123 , this is the correct result to leading order in the plasma density . instead of using the plasma density for the demonstration ,",
    "it is equivalent to use the linearly related plasma frequency @xmath124 .",
    "we have computed the leading and subleading terms in this quantity .",
    "the result ( [ below ] ) for @xmath125 involves @xmath126 while the result ( [ qabove ] ) for @xmath127 involves just @xmath124 .",
    "hence , for @xmath3 , ( [ below ] ) is leading and ( [ qabove ] ) is subleading , while for @xmath4 , their roles are reversed .",
    "thus , in either region the sum of the two contributions contains both the leading and ( first ) subleading terms , and so the limit of the sum at the physical dimension @xmath5 yields the correct result to leading order in the plasma density .",
    "the result ( [ qlimit ] ) , including the proper constants inside the logarithm , may also be essentially obtained by applying the @xmath128 heating formula ( [ joule ] ) directly in three dimensions with the use of the single - ring graph quantum form ( [ recoil ] ) of the dielectric function in the limit in which the electrons in the plasma are taken to have negligible velocity . placing this function in eq .",
    "( [ joule ] ) with @xmath5 , writing @xmath129 in the resulting delta function , and using this delta function to eliminate the polar angle @xmath130 of the solid angle integration gives a remaining integral over the magnitude @xmath10 of @xmath68 , @xmath131 .",
    "the leading terms for small @xmath79 of the upper and lower limits of this logarithmic integral give the result ( [ qlimit ] ) , except that the correct reduced mass @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ qlimit ] ) is replaced by the electron mass @xmath76 since the current @xmath132 describes the motion of a very heavy projectile particle .",
    "this sort of calculation was done some time ago by lindhard @xcite .",
    "although the reduced mass correction is negligible when the projectile is a heavy ion , it does represent a conceptual shortcoming of the quantum - corrected , joule heating treatment .",
    "moreover , this treatment completely breaks down when the projectile is itself an electron .",
    "this sort of dielectric treatment is also restricted to the case of a cold plasma whose electron velocities are much less than that of the projectile . on the other hand ,",
    "our method is easily extended @xcite to treat the case of a hot plasma where this restriction is not imposed , and again a complete calculation can be performed which includes the constants in addition to the logarithm .",
    "although , as we have just seen , the @xmath47 calculation can be improved to obtain the correct energy loss ( except for the replacement of the reduced by the electron mass ) , with the computation always done in three dimensions , we do not know of a similar improvement of the boltzmann equation in three dimensions which yields the correct result . one might be tempted to replace the coulomb potential by the screened debye potential .",
    "this alteration changes the @xmath133 factor in the cross section formula ( [ cross ] ) by @xmath134 in which @xmath135 is the squared debye wave number for the plasma .",
    "this alteration removes the long - distance infra - red divergence , and the cross section formula ( [ cross ] ) now converges in three dimensions .",
    "exponentiating this denominator using the integral representation ( [ exp ] ) with an additional factor of @xmath92 in the integrand to produce the square makes the remainder of the calculation easy , and one finds that @xmath136   \\,.\\ ] ] although the constant out in front of the logarithm is again the correct over - all constant , the argument of the logarithm is quite different from the correct form given in eq .",
    "( [ qlimit ] ) .",
    "this should have been expected at the outset because debye screening describes the static screening of a particle at rest in the plasma , not a dynamical screening of a fast moving particle which is the case that we are examining .",
    "as far as i know , such a dynamical screening within a boltzmann equation context can not be done .",
    "our method can be used to extend the result ( [ qlimit ] ) to arbitrary values of @xmath137 , always retaining the correct additional constants . to do this",
    ", we use some clever mathematics of lindhard and sorensen @xcite , but in a manner which justifies that these constants have been kept .",
    "namely , we compute @xmath138 this difference is well behaved in the limit @xmath139 since the pole at @xmath5 produced by the cross section integral comes from soft , infrared physics which is completely contained in the born approximation @xmath140 .",

    "essentially the same method applied here has been used before in my quantum field theory book @xcite to calculate the lamb shift for hydrogen - like atoms , with the small parameter role of the plasma density replaced by the nuclear charge @xmath155 .",
    "that exposition , however , was presented in a somewhat mystical manner , and it unfortunately did not bring out the essence of the method .",

    "@xcite explains in detail how a radiative energy correction may be expressed as a matrix element of the electron self - energy operator @xmath156 in coulomb , bound - state dirac wave functions of energy @xmath157 .",
    "the lamb shift is an energy difference that has both infrared and ultraviolet contributions just as in the more elementary plasma energy loss example explained above . in @xmath1 spatial dimensions ,",
    "these become two distinct physical processes that scale in different ways with a characteristic atomic energy spatial dimensions is given by @xmath158 , which reduces to the familiar scale @xmath159 in three dimensions .",

    "@xmath160 : removing a common overall factor , the ultraviolet contribution behaves as @xmath162 , while the infrared contribution goes as @xmath163 .",
    "since the energy @xmath164 vanishes when @xmath161 vanishes , we may take @xmath160 ( implicitly divided by some fixed energy scale to yield a dimensionless number ) as our small parameter .",
    "thus , just as in the previous plasma case , the infrared part dominates when @xmath3 , the ultraviolet part dominates when @xmath4 , the sum of the two contributions analytically extended in the vicinity of @xmath5 always contains both the dominant and leading sub - dominant terms , and so the @xmath41 limit of this sum yields the correct leading - order lamb shift . to tame the infrared divergences which are prevalent when @xmath3 , the binding of the electron must be accounted for . to tame the ultraviolet divergences that may appear when @xmath43 , a relativistic treatment must be made",
