    "the european xfel has been planed as a multiuser facility and from the beginning will have the possibility to distribute electron bunches of one beam pulse to one or the other of two electron beamlines , each serving its own set of undulators .",
    "additional space is reserved for the later addition of a third electron beamline . because different users have contradictory requirements to the bunch repetition pattern , operational flexibility will be reached by a distribution system which will use very stable flat - top kickers for directing beam into the undulator beamlines and fast single bunch kickers to kick individual bunches into the transport line to the beam dump before the beam distribution  @xcite .",
    "both , the beam separation between undulator beamlines and beam deflection into the beam dump will be realized with a kicker - septum scheme .",
    "while the beam quality in the dump line is not an issue , the optics of the beam separation between two undulator beamlines must meet a very tight set of performance specifications .",
    "it should be able to accept bunches with different energies ( up to @xmath0 from nominal energy ) and transport them without any noticeable deterioration not only transverse , but also longitudinal beam parameters , i.e. it must be sufficiently achromatic and sufficiently isochronous . besides that it is necessary to avoid magnet collisions in the design , and to keep the degradation of the beam quality due to collective effects within acceptable limits .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the optics solution for the beam separation area between two undulator beamlines ( see fig.1 ) with the main attention played to the improvement of the chromatic properties of the beam deflection arc by usage of sextupole and octupole magnets . because of the lambertson type septums used in the design , the deflection arc has nonzero horizontal and vertical dispersions simultaneously .",
    "this means that regardless of the fact that the linear on - energy betatron motion is still transversely uncoupled in such a beamline , we have not only the non - linear dispersions generated in both transverse planes , but also vertical and horizontal oscillations become chromatically coupled due to vertical dispersion in the horizontal bending magnets and horizontal dispersion in the vertical dipoles .",
    "nevertheless , because these effects are not the result of magnet misalignments and imperfections and are well controlled by the linear optics design , the usage of tilted sextupoles and octupoles in such a beamline allows to maintain the total number of multipoles required for correction of chromatic aberrations on the same level as required in the mid - plane symmetric systems .",
    "in this section we give formulas for the sextupole contributions to the second - order chromatic aberrations from which one can see similarities and differences in the usage of tilted sextupole magnets in the beamlines with non - flat dispersion and in beamlines which bend the beam only horizontally ( formulas ( [ chabb_16])-([chabb_30 ] ) with arbitrary angle @xmath1 and with angle @xmath1 multiple of @xmath2 , respectively ) .",
    "the effect of octupoles can be calculated and analyzed in a similar fashion and due to space limitation is not given here .    as usual , we take the path length along the reference orbit @xmath3 to be the independent variable and use a complete set of symplectic variables @xmath4 as particle coordinates  @xcite . in these variables",
    "the hamiltonian describing the motion of a particle in the magnetostatic system of interest can be written as    @xmath5 @xmath6 , \\label{ham1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the components of the magnetic vector potential multiplied by the rigidity of the reference particle , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the horizontal and vertical curvatures of the reference orbit , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 and that both curvatures are positive if the reference orbit bends in the direction opposite to that of the corresponding coordinate axis . with the assumption that all magnets in our system are multipoles of separate function type and with appropriately chosen vector potential",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) expanded up to third order in the variables @xmath13 then takes the form @xmath14 , where    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    and @xmath21 means equality up to order @xmath22 , prime denotes differentiation with respect to the variable @xmath3 , @xmath23 is a sextupole tilt angle , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are quadrupole and sextupole coefficients , respectively .",
    "we represent particle passage through our system by a symplectic map @xmath26 that maps the dynamical variables @xmath27 from the location @xmath28 to the location @xmath29 and use for this map the following lie factorization    @xmath30    here @xmath31 is a fundamental matrix solution of the linearized system driven by the hamiltonian ( [ ham3 ] ) and the function @xmath32 is a third order homogeneous polynomial :    @xmath33    we separate the polynomial @xmath32 in two parts @xmath34 , where @xmath35 describes the sextupole effects , and use a notation @xmath36 for the coefficient with which the monomial @xmath37 enters the polynomial @xmath35 .",
    "using polar coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath1 for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 elements , namely taking @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the formulas for the sextupole contributions to the chromatic aberrations can be written as follows .",

    "the beam deflection arc starts from the kickers which deflect beam vertically and , after enhancement of this deflection by the following quadrupole , the beam arrives at the entrance of the first lambertson septum magnet with the vertical separation from the horizontal midplane @xmath58 of about @xmath59 .",
    "the first septum magnet is tilted by approximately @xmath60 in such a way that it bends particles not only horizontally but also slightly upward .",
    "it is done in order to compensate the downward deflection produced by the vertically focusing large aperture quadrupole that follows after the septum , and in order to have the beam traveling in parallel to the horizontal midplane at the entrance of the three remaining ( non - tilted ) septum magnets , as can be seen in fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "the rest of the deflection arc is constructed from ordinary multipoles and the arc ends by a dogleg consisting of two vertical dipoles , which is used for bringing beam back to the horizontal plane @xmath61 and for closing the linear vertical dispersion .",
    "the @xmath62 coefficient of the transfer matrix of the total deflection arc ( considered from the entrance of the first kicker up to the exit of the last vertical dipole ) is equal to zero , i.e. the deflection arc is a first - order isochronous beamline .",
    "this is achieved by usage of two reverse bend dipoles placed close to the arc center .",
    "the entrance twiss parameters of the deflection arc are fixed and are defined by the behavior of the betatron functions in the straight beamline . the exit twiss functions are such that they allow easy matching to the periodic downstream transport channel ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "two tilted sextupoles and two tilted octupoles are placed in the arc to provide the required chromatic properties of the beam transport ( see fig.1 and fig.4 ) .",
    "note that the optimization of the number of sextupoles and octupoles , and their positions , strengths and tilt angles was not a separate task after the finishing of           and @xmath64 ellipses ( matched at the entrance ) after tracking through the deflection arc .",
