    "the van der waals - like behavior of a black hole is an interesting phenomenon in black hole physics .",
    "it helps us to understand new phase structure in black hole thermodynamics . in the pioneering work  @xcite",
    ", it was found that a charged ads black hole exhibits the van der waals - like phase transition in the @xmath0 plane . as the charge of the black hole increases from small to large , the black hole will undergo first order phase transition and second order phase transition successively before it reaches to a stable phase , which is analogous to the van der waals liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "the van der waals - like phase transition has also been observed in the @xmath1 plane @xcite , where @xmath2 is electric charge and @xmath3 is the chemical potential .",
    "further , the van der waals - like phase transition can be realized in the @xmath4 plane @xcite . where the negative cosmological constant is treated as the pressure @xmath5 and the thermodynamical volume @xmath6 is the conjugating quantity of pressure .    by ads",
    "/ cft @xcite , @xcite has investigated holographic entanglement entropy @xcite in a finite volume quantum system which is dual to a spherical and charged @xmath7 black hole .",
    "their results showed that there exists van der waals - like phase transition in the entanglement entropy - temperature plane .",
    "this phase transition is analogy with thermal dynamical phase transition .",
    "the critical exponent of the heat capacity for the second order phase transition was found to be consistent with that in the mean field theory .",
    "meanwhile @xcite investigated exclusively the equal area law in the entanglement entropy - temperature plane and found that the equal area law holds regardless of the size of the entangling region .",
    "there have been some extensive studies @xcite and all the results showed that as the case of thermal dynamical entropy , the entanglement entropy exhibited the van der waals - like phase transition .",
    "these results indicate that there are some intrinsic relation between black hole entropy and holographic entanglement entropy .",
    "furthermore , expectation value of wilson loop @xcite and the equal time two point correlation function of heavy operators have some similar properties as the entanglement entropy @xcite to reveal the phase transitions in quantum systems .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to extend ideas in @xcite to study van der waals - like phase transitions in a gauss - bonnet - ads black hole with a spherical horizon in ( 4 + 1)-dimensions in the framework of holography .",
    "firstly , we observe that the thermal dynamical entropy will undergo the van der waals - like phase transition in temperature - thermal entropy plane .",
    "we also study maxwell s equal area law and critical exponent of the heat capacity , which are two characteristic quantities in van der waals - like phase transition .",
    "secondly , we would like to study the holographic entanglement entropy for a fixed size of entangled region to confirm whether there is van der waals - like phase transition .",
    "more precisely speaking , considering that the holographic entanglement entropy formula should have quantum correction when the bulk theory have higher curvature terms . in terms of @xcite",
    ", one can study the holographic entanglement entropy with higher derivative gravity and see what will happen for the entanglement entropy .",
    "further , we study the expectation value of wilson loop and two point correlation function of heavy operator in the dual field theory to check whether these two objects also undergo the van der waals - like phase transition .",
    "we also check the analogous equal area law and critical exponent of the analogous heat capacity , which are to make sure that all these nonlocal quantum observables will undergo van der waals - like phase transition in the field theory dual to spherical gauss - bonnet - ads black holes .",
    "our results confirm the fact that the nonlocal quantum objects are good quantities to probe the phase structures of the spherical gauss - bonnet - ads black holes .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the black hole thermodynamics for the spherically symmetric gauss - bonnet - ads black hole and discuss the van der waals - like phase transition in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "we also check maxwell s equal area law and critical exponent of the heat capacity numerically . in section 3 , with the holographic entanglement entropy , wilson loop , and two point correlation function",
    ", we will show all these quantum objects undergo van der waals - like phase transition in the spherical gauss - bonnet - ads black hole . in each subsection , the equal area law is checked and the critical exponent of the analogues heat capacity is obtained via data fitting . in the final section , we present our conclusions .",
    "* note added * : while this paper was close to completion , we find @xcite also investigate holographic phase transition for a neutral gauss - bonnet - ads black hole in the extended phase space , which partially overlaps with our work .",
    "the 5-dimensional lovelock gravity can be realized by adding the gauss - bonnet term to pure einstein gravity theory . as a matter field",
    "is considered , the theory can be described by the following action @xcite @xmath8 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 where @xmath10 is newton constant , @xmath11 denotes the coupling of gauss - bonnet gravity , @xmath12 stands for the radius of ads background , which satisfies the relation @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the maxwell field strength with the vector potential @xmath15 . in this paper , we use geometric units of @xmath16 .",
    "the gauss - bonnet - ads black hole can be written as @xcite @xmath17 , \\label{aads}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass and @xmath2 is the charge of the black hole . in the low energy",
    "effective action of heterotic string theory , @xmath11 is proportional to the inverse string tension with positive parameter .",
    "thus in this paper we will consider the case @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "in addition , from ( [ peturbation ] ) , one can see that there is an upper bound for the gauss - bonnet parameter , namely @xmath21 .    in the gauss - bonnet - ads background ,",
    "the black hole event horizon @xmath22 is the largest root of the equation @xmath23 . at the event horizon",
    ", the hawking temperature can be expressed as @xcite @xmath24 in which we have used the relation @xmath25 the chemical potential in this background is @xmath26 the entropy of the black hole can be written as @xmath27 inserting ( [ cp ] ) into ( [ temperature ] ) , we can get the relation between the temperature and entropy @xmath28 .",
    "next , we will employ this relation to study the phase structure of the gauss - bonnet - ads black hole in the @xmath29 plane .      as we know",
    ", for a charged ads black hole , the spacetime undergos the van der waals - like phase transition as the charge changes from a small value to a large value .",
    "especially there is a critical charge , for which the temperature and entropy satisfy the following relation @xmath30 in our background , the function @xmath28 is too prolix so that we are hard to get the analytical value of the critical charge .",
    "we will get the critical charge numerically . in the gauss - bonnet gravity , it has been found that not only the charge but also the gauss - bonnet parameter will affect the phase structure of the black hole . when we discuss the effect of @xmath11 on the phase structure , the symbol @xmath2 in ( [ heat1 ] ) should be replaced by @xmath11 .",
    "firstly , we will fix the charge to discuss how the gauss - bonnet parameter affects the phase structure .",
    "we will set @xmath31 .",
    "for the case @xmath32 , we know that in the einstein gravity , the black hole undergos the hawking - page transition .",
    "but in our background , we find the black hole undergos the van der waals - like phase transition , which is shown in ( a ) of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "exactly , to get the van der waals - like phase transition in this case , we should find a critical value of the gauss - bonnet parameter .",
    "for the function @xmath28 is too prolix , we will get it numerically .",
    "we plot a series of curves with taking different values of @xmath11 in the @xmath29 plane shown in ( a ) of figure [ fig1 ] , and one can read off the region of critical value of the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath11 which satisfies with the condition @xmath33 .",
    "we plot a bunch of curves in the @xmath29 plane with smaller step so that we can get the precise critical value of @xmath11 . from ( b ) of figure [ fig1 ] , we find the exact critical value of the gauss - bonnet parameter should be about @xmath34 , which are labeled by the red dashed lines in ( b ) of figure [ fig1 ] . finally , we adjust the value of @xmath11 by hand to find the exact value of @xmath11 that satisfies @xmath33 , which produces @xmath35 . adapting the same strategy",
    ", we also can get the critical value of the gauss - bonnet parameter for the case @xmath36 , which produces @xmath37 . the phase structure for a fixed @xmath2",
    "is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    ".check of the equal area law in the @xmath29 plane . where the relative error is defined by @xmath38 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the @xmath39 plane , the equal area law can be defined as @xmath40 in which @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the smallest and largest values of the equation @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is also an interpolating function . for different @xmath2 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the results are listed in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "we can see that in the @xmath39 plane , the equal area law holds within a reasonable numeric accuracy .    for the second order phase transition",
    ", we will investigate the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath46 for different @xmath2 and @xmath11 , which are shown in figure [ fig14 ] .",
    "the straight lines in this figure can be fitted respectively as @xmath47 it is obvious that the slope of the fitted straight line is also about 3 , which implies that the critical exponent of the analogous heat capacity is -2/3 in the @xmath39 plane .",
    "the phase structures shown by equal time two heavy operators correlation function is consistent with that given by the holographic entanglement entropy and expectation value of wilson loop .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the thermal entropy of a ( 4 + 1)-dimensional spherical gauss - bonnet - ads black hole and found that there is van der waals - like phase transition in the @xmath29 plane for a fixed charge @xmath2 or a fixed gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath11 . for the case",
    "@xmath32 , the neural spherical gauss - bonnet - ads black hole still undergos the van der waals - like phase transition rather than the hawking - page phase transition appeared in the einstein gravity , which have been studied intensively .    for spherical ads black hole in einstein gravity , @xcite has observed that holographic entanglement entropy will also undergo van der waals - like phase transition which is much analogous to that in thermal entropy .",
    "we extended this observation to ( 4 + 1)-dimensional spherical gauss - bonnet - ads black hole and found there is a similar phenomenon .",
    "we apply ads / cft to study some non - local observables such as holographic entanglement entropy , wilson loop , and two point correlation function , which are dual to the minimal volume , minimal area , and geodesic length respectively in the conformal field theory . for a fixed charge or a fixed gauss - bonnet parameter ,",
    "all these quantities show that there exist van der waals - like phase transitions , which happen in thermal entropy already . below the critical charge or critical gauss - bonnet parameter",
    ", there exists phase which is composed by a small black hole , large black hole and a intermediate black hole . in this phase , the intermediate black hole will be not stable and the small black hole will directly jump to the large black hole as the temperature increases to the first order phase transition temperature @xmath48 .",
    "more precisely , we checked maxwell s equal area law and found it was valid for all the charges and gauss - bonnet parameters to confirm the first order phase transition .",
    "as the value of the charge or gauss - bonnet parameter increases to the critical value , the small black hole and the large black hole merges into one and the intermediate black hole disappear at transition temperature @xmath49 . for this case , phase transition will be the second order .",
    "the critical exponent of the analogous heat capacity is found to be consistent with that of the mean field theory .",
    "the black hole is always stable as the value of the charge or gauss - bonnet parameter is larger than the critical value .",
    "our results confirm the fact that all the nonlocal quantities exhibit van der waals - like phase transitions in the dual field theory regardless of the dual gravity model .",
