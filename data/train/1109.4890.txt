    "scale invariant quantum field theories can not interpret matter in terms of particles .",
    "motivated by the banks and zaks model @xcite , georgi @xcite conjectured a scenario that , unlike the one posed by the sm and its extensions , introduces scale invariant stuff associated with fractionary anomalous dimension operators .",
    "georgi suggested that a yet unseen scale invariant sector may exist in the high energy theory such that scale invariant stuff may interact weakly with the sm fields .",
    "such a hidden sector may manifest itself at an energy scale @xmath3 tev , and since physical particles can not exist in this sector , the interactions with the sm fields would occur through scale invariant fields known as unparticles .",
    "although a comprehensive study of this class of theories is very complex , it is possible to describe its low energy effects through an effective field theory .",
    "this allows one to study the phenomenological effects of unparticle stuff .    the appropriate theoretical framework to describe unparticle physics is the one introduced by banks and zaks @xcite .",
    "the hidden sector is a @xmath4 sector and the associated fields are described by renormalizable @xmath5 operators .",
    "it is assumed that these fields interact with the sm fields through the exchange of heavy particles at a very high energy @xmath6 . below this energy scale",
    "there is nonrenormalizable couplings between the fields of the @xmath7 sector and the sm fields , and @xmath8 which generically can be written as @xmath9 .",
    "dimensional transmutation is caused by the renormalizable couplings of the @xmath4 sector at an energy scale @xmath10 as scale invariance emerges .",
    "below this energy scale , an effective theory can be used to describe the interactions between the sm fields and the @xmath11 fields , which are associated with unparticles .",
    "the effective lagrangian can be written as @xcite :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 stands for the coupling constant and the operator dimension @xmath1 can be fractionary . from theoretical considerations @xcite ,",
    "it has been noted @xcite that unitarity is guaranteed in the interval @xmath14 .",
    "the lorentz structure of unparticle operators is nontrivial but it can be constructed from the nature of the primary operator @xmath5 and its transmutation .",
    "such a lorentz structure can be scalar , @xmath15 , vector , @xmath16 , spinor or tensor , @xmath17 .",
    "the respective propagators of these unparticles along with their interactions with the sm particles have been studied with detail in @xcite .",
    "shortly afterwards the unparticle idea came out , the study of its phenomenology was eagerly addressed @xcite .",
    "one interesting effect could arise from the interference between unparticle and sm amplitudes , such as could occur in the drell - yan process at the tevatron and the lhc @xcite : in particular , the most peculiar effects could be observed in the invariant dilepton invariant mass distribution near the @xmath18-pole @xcite .",
    "this class of interference effects could also be evident in diphoton production at the lhc @xcite .",
    "as far as the direct production of unparticles is concerned , it has been studied through mono - photon , @xmath19 , and mono-@xmath18 production , @xmath20 @xcite , whereas the production of an unparticle accompanied by a mono - jet was studied in @xcite .",
    "several decays of sm particles into unparticles have been examined : @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite , and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "in addition , other topics on unparticle physics have been studied , such as the possible effects of unparticles on cp violation @xcite , lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) @xcite , and lepton electromagnetic properties @xcite .    in order to impose constraints on unparticle parameters ,",
    "several experimental data have been used .",
    "the @xmath19 process was studied to explain @xmath25 production at lep @xcite .",
    "it was found that lep data are consistent with the values @xmath26 tev for @xmath27 and @xmath28 tev for @xmath291.4 .",
    "unparticle constraints have also been obtained from experimental data on cosmology and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "apart from the tree - level effects , loop induced unparticle effects have studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the electron magnetic dipole moment via scalar and vector unparticles was obtained in @xcite .",
    "this study was later extended for the muon magnetic moment due to scalar unparticles with lfv couplings @xcite , whereas the lepton electric dipole moment via scalar unparticles was studied in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the calculation of the fermion dipole moments via fermion unparticles was presented in @xcite .",
    "the study of loop induced decays mediated by unparticles has also been addressed , for instance the decays @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite . in this work",
    "we are interested in calculating the spin-1 unparticle contribution to the magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) and the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of leptons in the most general case when there is lfv interactions . to our knowledge",
    "this calculation has not been presented in the literature .",
    "the rest of the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present an overview of unparticle operators .",
    "section iii is devoted to the results for the lepton electromagnetic vertex mediated by vector unparticles , while the numerical analysis is presented in sec .",
    "the conclusions and outlook are presented in sec . v.",
    "the interactions between the sm particles and unparticles occur through the exchange of heavy fields of mass @xmath6 .",
    "once those heavy fields are integrated out , the effective lagrangian that describes the interactions between the sm particles and unparticles is obtained .",
    "this effective lagrangian is composed by a tower of effective operators that can be constructed out of the sm fields by invoking the @xmath32 gauge symmetry . for instance , the effective interactions of spin-0 and spin-1 unparticles with sm fermions are as follows @xcite :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 stand for the family index and @xmath36 stands for the associated coupling constants .",
    "these effective operators break scale invariance .    due to the invariant scale nature of unparticles ,",
    "their propagators can be constructed by means of unitary cuts and the spectral decomposition formula .",
    "therefore , the scalar unparticle propagator is given by :    @xmath37    where the @xmath38 function , which is introduced to normalize the spectral density @xcite , is given as follows :    @xmath39    as far as the vector unparticle is concerned , its propagator is given by    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is given explicitly as @xmath42 the form of this expression is due to the spin structure of this class of unparticles @xcite .",
    "also @xmath43 , which is a reflect of the unphysical nature of unparticles .",
    "when the unparticle field is taken as transverse , it turns out that @xmath44 , which translates into the condition @xmath45 .",
    "however , in the context of a specific conformal invariance , @xmath46 @xcite . in the limit @xmath47 the propagator @xmath48 turns out to be the propagator of a massless scalar particle , as expected :    @xmath49",
    "among the best measured particle observables , the muon mdm , @xmath50 , stand outs : it has been measured with an impressive accuracy of @xmath51 ppm .",
    "the current world average , which is dominated by the measurements of the e281 collaboration at bnl , is given by @xcite @xmath52 where the statistical and systematic errors , @xmath53 ppm and @xmath54 ppm , have been added in quadrature .",
    "the sm theoretical prediction is given by the sum of the qed , electroweak and the hadronic contributions .",
    "a recent review of these calculations is given in @xcite .",
    "while the qed and electroweak contributions to @xmath50 have been calculated with a great precision , the largest uncertainty arises from the hadronic contribution , which is still under revision .",
    "the theoretical sm prediction is @xmath55 where the @xmath56 data have been used to calculate the leading - order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution @xcite .",
    "there is thus a discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical predictions larger than 3.6 standard deviations @xcite : @xmath57 as long as this disagreement is attributed entirely to new physics @xcite , the allowed minimal an maximal limits for these contributions , with 95% c.l are @xmath58",
    ". it may be however that such a discrepancy will reduce to an acceptable level once the hadronic contribution is determined with best accuracy .",
    "another well studied fermion electromagnetic property is the edm , @xmath59 , which can provide an excellent probe of new sources of cp - violation . in the sm ,",
    "the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mechanism can not account for the amount of cp violation required to explain the baryogenesis asymmetry of the universe .",
    "it has been long known that the experimental observation of an edm of fundamental particles will hint to new physics as the sm predictions are very small .",
    "for instance , the electron edm is predicted to be negligibly small as it arises up to the three - loop level via the ckm phase .",
    "other models such as supersymetry , multi higgs and the left - right symmetric model predict much larger values for @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the current experimental limit on the electron edm with 90% c.l .",
    "is @xcite :    @xmath61    whereas the experimental limits on the positive and negative muon edms with 95% c.l .",

    "we note that there is a flip in the sign of the vector and axial - vector couplings .    for our analysis below",

    "we would also like to note that in the case of diagonal unparticle couplings , we obtain for the spin-0 and spin-1 unparticle contributions to @xmath76 :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 stands for the diagonal unparticle couplings .",
    "this result agrees with the result presented in @xcite for the electron mdm .",
    "as far as the lepton edm is concerned , we will consider the contribution from both spin-0 and spin-1 unparticles .",
    "the edm of fermion @xmath35 , which can only arise if both @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) are nonzero and have an imaginary phase , is given by    @xmath83    where @xmath84 runs over @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "apart from the muon mdm , experimental limits on lfv process are known to be useful to constrain lfv couplings .",
    "lfv processes involving the muon are among the most constrained by the experiment . for instance , there are stringent constraints on lfv muon decays : br@xmath94 @xcite and br@xmath95 @xcite . furthermore , the bound on the @xmath96 rate is expected to be improved by about one order of magnitude by the meg experiment @xcite .",
    "however , less stringent constraints exist for lfv @xmath97 transitions : br@xmath98 @xcite , br@xmath99 @xcite , etc . below we will analyze the constraints on lfv spin-1 unparticle couplings .      a comprehensive analysis of the spin-1 unparticle contribution to the muon mdm would require to deal with several free parameters : six coupling constants , the unparticle scale and the unparticle operator dimension .",
    "we will take another approach instead and consider some particular scenarios of lfv together with the hypothesis that there is no large cancellation between different unparticle contributions .",
    "first of all , we will assume that there is a hierarchy in the lfv unparticle couplings as it is assumed in other models of lfv , i.e. , @xmath100 for all the unparticle couplings .",
    "since experimental data strongly constrains lfv between the muon and the electron , we will concentrate on the scenario where lfv transitions are dominated by the couplings of spin-1 unparticles with the tau and muon leptons . more specifically",

    "this effect is more evident for the contributions of the tau lepton .",
    "furthermore , the contributions from axial - vector couplings are larger in magnitude than the vector contributions , with the largest contribution arising from the muon loop .",
    "it means that as long the vector and axial - vector unparticle couplings were of similar order of magnitude ( scenario a ) the total contribution to the muon mdm could be negative .",

    "<S> the magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) and the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of leptons are calculated under the assumption of lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) induced by spin-1 unparticles with both vector and axial - vector couplings to leptons , including a cp - violating phase . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental limits on the muon mdm and lfv process such as the decay @xmath0 are then used to constrain the lfv couplings for particular values of the unparticle operator dimension @xmath1 and the unparticle scale @xmath2 , assuming that lfv transitions between the tau and muon leptons are dominant . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the current experimental constraints favor a scenario with dominance of the vector couplings over the axial - vector couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain estimates for the edms of the electron and the muon , which are well below the experimental values . </S>"
