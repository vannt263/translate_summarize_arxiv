    "astrophysical black holes , such as active galactic nuclei , black hole binaries , and possibly gamma - ray bursts , are thought to be powered by disk accretion flows ( accretion disks ) . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the disks are known to exhibit three distinct modes according to the mass accretion rate ; standard disk ( @xcite1973 ) , radiatively inefficient accretion flow /advection dominated accretion flow ( @xcite1977 ; @xcite1994 ) , and slim disk ( @xcite1988 ) .",
    "the slim disk appears when the accretion rate is much larger than the critical rate , @xmath9 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the eddington luminosity and the speed of light .",
    "@xcite has reported that the standard disk turns into the slim disk at the accretion rate of @xmath10 , where the efficiency , @xmath11 , is around 0.1 or less and is a function of a spin parameter of the black hole .",
    "the slim disk can shine above the eddington luminosity in contrast to that the disk luminosities of standard disk and radiatively inefficient accretion flow are less than the eddington luminosity .",
    "the slim disk basically succeeded in reproducing the observed features of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) and narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies , which are candidates of near- or super - critical flows ( @xcite2001 ; @xcite2000 ; @xcite2003 ) .",
    "outflow from the slim disk is of interest to recent observational and theoretical studies .",
    "it has been reported by recent observations that powerful outflows are ejected from the central engine of ulxs .",
    "some of the bubbles / nebulae around ulxs are shock - excited via the outflow , of which the kinetic power is estimated as @xmath12 ( @xcite2002 ; @xcite2003 ; @xcite2006 ; @xcite2007 ; @xcite2012 ) . since the slim disk is basically one - dimensional model , the launching outflow is not taken into consideration .",
    "two - dimensional version of the slim disk is studied by radiation hydrodynamics ( rhd ) simulations ( @xcite1988 ; @xcite2002 ; @xcite2006 ; @xcite2009 ) and radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations ( @xcite2009 ; @xcite2010 ; @xcite2011 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite(2005 ; hereafter o05 ) for the first time demonstrated the quasi - steady super - critical accretion is feasible .",
    "the luminosity and the mass accretion rate exceed the eddington luminosity and the critical rate .",
    "o05 also revealed that the outflow is launched from the disk surface via the radiation force for thomson scattering .",
    "high - velocity outflow , which is defined as the matter being blown away with speed of @xmath13 , appear around the rotation axis , where @xmath1 is the escape velocity .",
    "however , at wide off - axis angle , huge amount of mass passes out through the outer boundary at @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being schwarzschild radius , with velocity of @xmath16 ( low - velocity outflow ) .",
    "behavior of such low - velocity outflow is significant issue .",
    "if the outflowing matter continues to be accelerated and exceeds the escape velocity at a great distance , the angular size of the high - velocity outflow would increase significantly .",
    "otherwise the gas comes back to the vicinity of the black hole and mass accretion rate would go up . in the former case",
    ", powerful outflows might excite the interstellar medium via shock , reproducing the shock - excited bubbles observed around ulxs .",
    "the mass accretion might be interrupted by the ram pressure and/or shock heating , preventing quasi - steady super - critical accretion .",
    "however , global structure and dynamics of the outflows at the large distance have not been investigated previously .",
    "this is a motivation for the present study .    here , we perform two - dimensional rhd simulations of super - critical accretion flows and outflows .",
    "we employ large computational box of @xmath17 .",
    "we explain basic equations and the numerical methods in  [ basic eq ] , and display the structure of the wide - angle powerful outflows  [ result ] . finally ,  [ discussion ] and  [ conc ] are devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we describe basic equations of rhd and our numerical method .",
    "we employ spherical polar coordinates @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the radial distance , @xmath4 is the polar angle , and @xmath20 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "our numerical method is same as o05 except for the size of the computational domain .",
    "while they set the size of the domain to be 500@xmath15 , we extended it to 5000@xmath15 in order to investigate the motion of the outflows at the outer regions of @xmath21 .",
    "since we assume axial symmetry as well as reflection symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane , the computational domain consists of spherical shells of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are set to be @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this domain is divided into @xmath28 grid cells , though o05 employs @xmath29 grid points .",
    "the @xmath30 grids along the radial direction are equally spaced logarithmically , while the @xmath31 grids are equally distributed as satisfying @xmath32 . here ,",
    "because the number of grid points in radial direction within @xmath33 is 96 , the resolution of the present work is the same as that of o05 near the black hole .    by an explicit - implicit finite difference scheme on the eulerian grids ,",

    ", we consider the free - free absorption and the bound - free absorption for solar metallicity ( @xcite1962 ; @xcite1979 ; see also o05 ) .",

    "the temperature of the gas , @xmath57 , can be calculated from @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the blotzmann constant and @xmath60 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "we apply the flux - limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation ( @xcite1981 ) .",
    "then , the radiation flux , @xmath61 , and the radiation pressure tensor , @xmath48 , are expressed in terms of the radiation energy density ( see o05 ) .",
    "we consider only @xmath62-componet in the viscous stress tensor .",
    "the dynamical viscosity coefficient is given by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath65 is the keplerian angular speed , and @xmath66 is the flux limiter , which becomes @xmath67 in the optically thick limit and null in the optically thin limit . here",
    "we note that the momentum conservation is not strictly accurate in the present simulations .",
    "this is because that , in the fld approximation , the radiation flux is simply given as a function of the gradient of the radiation energy without being solved by conservative form .",
    "such problem should be resolved by numerical simulations with m-1 closure method (;",
    "recently , the simulations of the radiation dominated accretion disks around black holes with m-1 closure have been performed by ( , ) and @xcite the hydrodynamical terms for ideal fluid in eqs .",

    "our initial and boundary conditions are essentially same as those of o05 .",
    "we start the calculations with a hot and rarefied atmosphere , and matter is continuously injected into the computational domain through the outer disk boundary , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( as we have mentioned above , the outer boundary is located at @xmath33 in o05 and we employ @xmath70 ) .",
    "such injected matter is supposed to have a specific angular momentum corresponding to the keplerian angular momentum at @xmath71 . in the present study",
    ", we mainly investigate the case that the injected mass accretion rate at the outer boundary ( mass input rate , @xmath72 ) is @xmath73 and @xmath74 is @xmath75 ( base line model ) . in  [ comparison model ] , we discuss the results for @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( comparison model 1 ) as well as @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( comparison model 2 ) .",
    "although there is no accretion disk initially , the injected matter accumulates within the computational domain .",
    "then , the accretion disk as well as the launching outflow appears .",

    "they are time - averaged in the elapsed time between @xmath81 sec and 200 sec ( the keplerian time at @xmath71 is about 0.9 sec in the present simulations because of @xmath82 .",
    "the high density region at @xmath83 ( red and white ) corresponds to super - critical accretion disk ( disk region ) , which is radiation pressure - dominated , and geometrically and optically thick .",
    "the injected matter freely falls in the yellow region near the equatorial plane at @xmath84 ( free - fall region ) , since the centrifugal force is less than the gravity . except for the disk region and the free - fall region , we find that the matter moves outwards for the wide angle ( wide - angle outflow region ) .",

    "the high - velocity outflow appears only at the angle of @xmath85 near the black hole ( @xmath86 ) . in @xmath87 ,",
    "the matter is gradually accelerated and its velocity is over @xmath1 at the outer region .",
    "for example , the radial velocity exceeds escape velocity at @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and we find that @xmath0 achieves @xmath1 at @xmath90 for @xmath91 . as a result , the matter is ejected from the outer boundary with @xmath92 for almost all direction ( @xmath93 ) except for the vicinity of the equatorial plane .",

    "since the nebula itself is not always excited by the shock , the direct comparison may be difficult . nevertheless , the observed bipolar structure is reminiscent of what is seen in our model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mescr_power ] ) , where the kinetic power is higher around the polar direction .",
    "the required kinetic power for the observed jet component ( @xmath194 ) is also similar to that obtained in our model .",
    "it is noted that such a structure is found not only around ulxs , but also around a microquasar , ngc 7793 s26 , for which the super - critical accretion has been suggested ( @xcite2010 ; @xcite2010 ) .",
    "some of ulxs show the time variation in x - ray band .",
    "@xcite(2013 ) suggested that such variation is induced by the clumpy structure in the disk wind . in their model ,",
    "ulxs exhibit the soft spectra and time variation for off - axis observers .",
    "in contrast , face - on observes detect the hard spectra and weak time variation ( see also sutton et al . 2013a ; 2013b ) .",
    "although the present work focus on the time - averaged structure , our simulations show the messy structure in the wide - angle outflow .",
    "this is also consistent with the observations of ulxs .",
    "however , spatial resolution in the present study is not enough to resolve the clumpy structure in detail .",
    "@xcite(2013 ) demonstrated clumpy disk wind launched from the super - critical disks by high - resolution simulations ( see also @xcite2014 ) .",
    "thus , we stress again that our model supports the model of the super - critical accretion onto the stellar mass black holes in ulxs .",
    "by performing two - dimensional rhd simulations with large computational box , @xmath195 , we investigate the wide - angle , powerful outflow launched from the super - critical accretion disks .",
    "the strong radiation force drives the disk wind out in all directions ( @xmath196 ) except for the vicinity of the equatorial plane , in which the matter accretes inwards .",
    "the angular size of the high - velocity outflow , of which the outflowing velocity is larger than the escape velocity , broadens with an increase of the distance from the black hole .",
    "the outflow around the rotation axis is effectively accelerated and exceeds the escape velocity near the black hole .",
    "in contrast , at the larger polar angle , the matter continues to be gradually accelerated and attains the escape velocity at a distance of a few thousand schwarzschild radius . since the high - velocity outflow does not prevent the mass accretion along the equatorial plane , quasi - steady super - critical accretion onto the black hole is realized .    due to the wide - angle high - velocity outflow ,",
    "the mass and kinetic energy is ejected in all directions . however , the kinetic power is larger in the polar direction than in the horizontal direction .",
    "the kinetic power is comparable to the photon luminosity , and is a few times larger than the eddington luminosity , which corresponds to @xmath8 for the stellar mass black holes .",
    "our results nicely fit the recent observations of shock - excited bubbles around ulxs .",
    "thus , our model supports a hypothesis that ulxs are powered by the super - critical accretion onto stellar mass black holes .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous reviewer for many helpful comments .",
