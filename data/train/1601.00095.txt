    "single - layer ( sl ) transition metal dichalcogenides are currently receiving considerable attention mainly due to their electronic similarity to graphene , but with the important distinction of having a seizeable band gap .",
    "they constitute a promising materials platform for exploring spin and valley degrees of freedom @xcite and the consequences of strongly bound excitons in two - dimensions @xcite .",
    "particular focus has been on mos@xmath0 @xcite , a material for which sls can be readily obtained by a micromechanical exfoliation method similar to that used for the initial isolation of graphene .",
    "sl mos@xmath0 has been used in applications such as field effect transistors @xcite and optoelectronic devices @xcite . moreover ,",
    "mos@xmath0 nanoclusters had already been grown in sls and used in catalysis even before the advent of graphene @xcite .    the key difference between the electronic structure of sl mos@xmath0 and its three - dimensional ( 3d ) parent compound is the nature of the band gap .",
    "3d mos@xmath0 in the stable 2h - structure has an indirect band gap with the valence band maximum ( vbm ) at the @xmath4 point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) and the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 points .",
    "sl mos@xmath0 , on the other hand , has both the vbm and cbm at the @xmath1 point of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) bz ( corresponding to the @xmath5@xmath6 line in the bulk bz ) @xcite .",
    "the band character change between bulk and sl happens mainly because the original vbm and cbm are shifted to lower and higher energy , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the states around @xmath1 ( or @xmath5@xmath6 ) are not significantly affected by the structural change and turn into the new vbm and cbm of the sl .",
    "this band gap change can be understood qualitatively by considering the bulk band structure of the material : the bands forming the vbm and cbm of bulk mos@xmath0 show dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the mos@xmath0 sheets of the crystal and are thus subject to quantum confinement for thin crystals ( to see this , compare the dispersion of the bands in the @xmath4@xmath5 and @xmath7@xmath6 directions in e.g. ref .",
    "the states forming the vbm and cbm of the sl , on the other hand , show hardly any dispersion in the @xmath5@xmath6 direction and are therefore unaffected by quantum confinement effects .",
    "these differences are inherently related to the orbital character of the different states , where higher dispersion in the @xmath5@xmath6 direction indicates a larger contribution from out - of - plane orbitals . in this simple picture , placing a sl of mos@xmath0 onto a substrate can be expected to have a severe impact on the band structure since it strongly modifies the boundary condition for quantum confinement on one side of the sl . moreover , placing the sl on a metallic substrate has the potential to alter the band structure and band gap of the sl due to increased screening from the substrate @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we explore the band structure and band gap of epitaxial sl mos@xmath0 grown on au(111 ) .",

    "@xcite , we have recently developed a procedure to nearly saturate almost the entire surface of au(111 ) by sl mos@xmath0 @xcite and we have presented initial experimental results of the system s electronic structure determined by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) in ref .",
    "overall , the ( occupied ) electronic structure of the supported sl closely resembles the theoretical predictions for free - standing sl mos@xmath0 .",

    "we clarify the nature of the mos@xmath0-substrate interaction , establish a theoretical understanding of the transition metal dichalcogenide - metal interaction and explain the deviations between the arpes results and the band structure of a free - standing layer .",
    "epitaxial sl mos@xmath0 has been grown on au(111 ) by methods described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the total mos@xmath0 coverage for most of the arpes data shown here and in ref.@xcite was kept below one monolayer ( ml ) at @xmath8  ml in order to avoid the growth of 2  ml islands .",
    "the epitaxial sl mos@xmath0 samples are stable in air and could thus be removed from the dedicated growth chamber , transported to the sgm-3 end station of the synchrotron radiation source astrid2 @xcite and cleaned via mild annealing to 500  k. this procedure has been verified to yield atomically clean surfaces by stm @xcite .",
    "arpes data were collected at 80  k with an energy and angular resolution better than 20mev and 0.2@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the measurements presented here were performed at two different photon energies , 49ev and 70ev .",
    "the dispersion of the highest valence band of mos@xmath0 is most intense in the 49ev data while the 70ev data is dominated by the au bulk bands .",

    "such an expansion results in an artificial destabilization of the au surface and to shifts of au surface and bulk bands to higher energies .",

    "note that such a distortion of the uppermost valence band does not take place for exfoliated sl mos@xmath0 deposited on sio@xmath0 substrates @xcite , presumably due to the weaker bonding of the sulphur atoms to the substrate .",
    "a second point of disagreement between the measured dispersion and the calculation for the free - standing layer is the dispersion of the bands around @xmath3 . in the calculation",
    ", the spin - splitting of the bands reduces to zero at @xmath3 .",
    "this is expected at @xmath3 ( and at @xmath2 ) due to the combination of time - reversal and crystal symmetry .",
    "@xmath3 is a so - called time - reversal invariant momentum in the 2d bz @xcite , meaning that two @xmath3 points can be connected both by an inversion of the @xmath21-direction and by a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the combination of these symmetries enforces a spin - degeneracy in the 2d electronic states .",
    "this degeneracy is observed at @xmath2 but the situation is somewhat unclear at @xmath3 .",
    "we shall return to these two points of disagreement below when we discuss the calculations for sl mos@xmath0 adsorbed on au(111 ) .",
    "the arpes data only gives very limited information on the character and size of the sl mos@xmath0 band gap since only states below the fermi energy are accessible . as a consequence , we can only conclude that the band gap must be larger than @xmath221.3ev , i.e. corresponding to the energy of the vbm .",
    "we have previously attempted to determine this band gap by alkali atom doping @xcite and by time- and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , i.e. by pumping electrons into the conduction band and subsequent emission by a second photon @xcite .",
    "adsorbing potassium atoms onto the surface does indeed lead to a sufficiently strong charge donation to push the cbm below the fermi level , resulting in the observation of a direct band gap at @xmath1 with a size of ( 1.39@xmath200.05)ev .",
    "however , it is questionable if this measured gap corresponds to the gap of the pristine system as potassium adsorption also leads to a distortion of the occupied bands in which states with out - of - plane orbital character ( e.g. the upper valence band at @xmath2 ) are shifted more than states with in - plane orbital character ( e.g. the vbm at @xmath1 ) .",
    "indeed , it has been found that sodium intercalation in bulk mos@xmath0 does not only lead to electron donation but to a change of the band gap as such @xcite and can even trigger a transition from the semiconducting 2h - phase to the metallic 1t - phase @xcite .",
    "the band gap determined by pump / probe arpes , which does not require doping with alkali metals , is ( 1.95@xmath200.05)ev @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that this electronic band gap is a fundamentally different quantity from the optical gap , which is generally measured by absorption and photoluminescence experiments @xcite . in simple terms",
    ", the optical band gap corresponds to the energy required to create an exciton while the electronic band gap also requires the breaking of the exciton and is thus higher due to the exciton binding energy .",

    "however , we found no statistical correlation between variations in intensity or peak location and the spatial location within the unit cell of the moir pattern . therefore , we only considered spatially averaged spectra taken near the center of mos@xmath0 islands and away from domain boundaries ( edges ) for determining the energy gap .",
    "sts acquired in a @xmath202ev energy window ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c ) ) shows a regime of very low conductance around the fermi energy , i.e. between @xmath251ev and 0.5ev , with onsets of the conductance at higher absolute energies .",
    "the sts spectra greatly differ from those acquired on the clean au(111 ) surface areas which only show the typical surface state onset below the fermi energy .",

    "features in the @xmath28 versus @xmath29 plot are harder to discern but it is possible to determine the exact position of the band edges by plotting @xmath30 versus @xmath29 instead @xcite .",
    "in the present case , the metallic character of the support and its strong hybridization with sl mos@xmath0 lead to a net ( albeit low ) conduction in the band gap and to smoother conductance variations , which hinders the possibility of assigning small increases to the band edges . we therefore approximate onsets to the peaks in the sts spectra .    in the valence band regime",

    "the energy difference between vb2 and vb1 is 0.36ev and in agreement with the @xmath220.31ev determined from arpes data for the same sample . in the conduction band ,",
    "we see three onsets ( cb1 - 3 ) , specifically a step centered at @xmath33ev ( cb1 ) and two resonances at @xmath34ev ( cb2 ) and @xmath35ev ( cb3 ) . correlating cb1 and vb1 to the @xmath1 band onsets yields a band gap value of ( 1.74@xmath200.27)ev , where the larger error stems from the uncertainty in defining the position of the cb1 step .    while the gap agrees reasonably well with the pump / probe arpes results of ref .",
    "@xcite , sts measurements on similar samples , but carried out at room temperature , have been reported to yield a smaller band gap of 1.3ev @xcite .",

    ", we also observe such charge redistribution , which is strongly localized at the interface and extends to the s - mo - s layer but not to the vacuum region ( not shown ) .    for the on - top matched model the stronger interaction with the surface shifts the mos@xmath0 states towards lower energies than for the other sites .",
    "this is due to the more favorable s - au bonds , which involve stronger charge transfer and redistribution at the interface . for the matched models with the hcp and fcc positions , the interaction and the resulting pdos shifts are weaker but they are similar to each other , consistent with a similar s - au bonding geometry .",

    "the position and character of the bands can be seen more clearly by analyzing the calculated band structures for free - standing sl mos@xmath0 and the sl adsorbed on au(111 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( first and second panels ) .",
    "the band structure for the sl on au(111 ) corresponds to the matched model in the most stable on - top binding geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the calculated band structure for the free - standing layer is in excellent agreement with previous results using the same exchange - correlation functional @xcite , and the resulting band gap ( 1.58ev ) is also very similar .",
    "this value significantly underestimates the electronic gap of  2.8ev determined by more sophisticated quasi - particle ( gw ) calculations @xcite .",
    "interestingly , calculations with the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite or with another exchange - correlation functional ( pw91 ) within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) lead to slightly ( @xmath39ev ) larger values @xcite than the 1.58  ev calculated here .",
    "band gap underestimation is a well - known shortcoming of the lda and gga approaches , which can be partially remedied by including a fraction of hartree - fock exchange , leading to the so - called hybrid functional formalism .",
    "indeed , calculations with such functionals yield improved band gaps of  2.05ev @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , studying the mos@xmath0/au(111 ) with standard dft methods provides valuable insight into the effect of the substrate on the band structure despite the gap underestimation .",
    "+    for the on - top matched model , the adsorption of the mos@xmath0 layer on au(111 ) leads to pronounced changes in its band structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , second panel ) but , surprisingly , the fundamental gap near @xmath1 ( 1.58ev ) is only 0.02ev lower than for the free - standing layer .",
    "moreover , the bands forming the vbm and cbm of the layer remain well - defined , something that is ascribed to their greater contribution from mo orbitals ( which do not directly bond to the au substrate ) , to the in - plane nature of such states for the vbm and , most importantly , to their position in a projected gap of the au(111 ) band structure .",
    "the binding energies of the occupied bands for the matched model are generally in good agreement with the experimental values from arpes , and the position in the projected band gap is consistent with the vbm states being very sharp in arpes .",
    "however , the exact energy of the bands for the matched model is affected by the artificial strain induced in the au(111 ) slab , as described above , and should thus not be directly compared to the arpes values",
    ". the unchanged size of the band gap with respect to the free - standing sl mos@xmath0 , on the other hand , is a common feature of all models , and the same was found for other mismatched models with compressed au(111 ) surfaces when studied with similar levels of theory  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the situation around the fundamental gap , the upper valence band near @xmath2 is strongly affected by the adsorption on au(111 ) . the band is still well - defined as it enters the bulk continuum and its spin - splitting is lost . however , very close to @xmath2 it strongly merges with the bulk bands .",
    "the band maximum at @xmath2 is very diffuse but significantly lower ( by @xmath220.4ev ) than at the @xmath1 point .",
    "these observations are in excellent agreement with the experiment where a similar energy shift and a strong broadening , indicative of mos@xmath0-substrate interaction , is observed .",
    "in fact , this band structure change is consistent with the simple expectation that the adsorbate - substrate interaction should mainly affect the boundary condition for the quantization of the out - of - plane states in the sl .",
    "note that the mos@xmath0 character is retained for higher energy states near @xmath2 and the resulting dispersion of these states is very similar to the arpes results in fig .  [",
    "fig:2](a ) .    the band structure can be further explored by decomposing the states of the sl mos@xmath0/au(111 ) model into the contribution from the mo atoms and from the lower ( in contact with au ) and upper ( in contact with the vacuum ) layer of s atoms .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows such weighted band structures , separated into out - of - plane orbitals and in - plane orbitals .",
    "the vbm of the mos@xmath0 layer is mostly formed from in - plane mo 4@xmath19 states at the @xmath1 point ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) which , together with their position in the projected band gap , explains why it remains relatively unaffected by the interaction with the au(111 ) surface .",
    "the cbm at the @xmath1 point , on the other hand , is formed by out - of - plane mo 4@xmath19 states , which are expected to be distorted by out - of plane interactions . considering this and the low gap measured by sts ,",
    "a gap variation upon interaction with the au substrate is expected .",
    "nevertheless , the size of the fundamental gap at @xmath1 calculated here is unaffected by the interaction with the metallic substrate .",
    "this points to the inefficiency of the semi - local lda or gga approaches in capturing subtle effects of out - of - plane interactions in band gaps involving correlated states .",
    "these methods suffer from an inherent self - interaction error and only partially account for electronic correlation , neglecting long - range exchange . in contrast , gw calculations account for long - range coulomb interaction and are able to predict subtle screening effects . for sl mose@xmath0 ( which has a very similar electronic structure to mos@xmath0 )",
    "a small direct gap reduction is calculated upon interaction with a support @xcite , and lower @xmath1-@xmath1 gaps are predicted when increasing the number of layers or decreasing the interlayer distance in mos@xmath40@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the situation at @xmath1 , the vbm at @xmath2 contains significant contributions from the sulphur @xmath41 states ( as well as some contribution for out - of - plane mo 4@xmath42 and 4@xmath43 orbitals ) and here we observe a strong asymmetry for the top and bottom sulphur atoms . while the top - atoms still participate in the formation of the upper valence band states at @xmath2 , the contribution of the @xmath41 orbitals of the bottom sulphur atoms is completely hybridized and merged with the au(111 ) states . as one might have expected , this is an indication of a strong au - s bonding in the system .",
    "this strong bond will presumably limit the possibilities to modify the electronic properties of epitaxial mos@xmath0 on au(111 ) compared to the case of graphene on transition metal surfaces , where a large number of atomic species can be intercalated between the graphene and the surface in order to change the graphene s electronic properties @xcite .",
    "the strong interaction with the bulk state continuum can also explain the failure to observe the expected spin - degenerate upper valence band at @xmath3 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](second panel ) , the upper valence band mixes so strongly with the au states that it does not exist as a well - defined state at @xmath3 .",
    "this is in contrast to exfoliated sl mos@xmath0 deposited on sio@xmath0 where the upper valence band can be observed in the entire 2d bz , albeit without a well - resolved spin - orbit splitting @xcite .    4 au(111 ) surface and ( b ) the mismatched model consisting of a @xmath12 r13.9@xmath9 cell of mos@xmath0 on a 4@xmath114 cell of au(111 ) .",
    "the position of relevant mos@xmath0 bands ( vb1 , vb2 , and cb1 ) has been indicated according to the labels in figs .  [ fig:3](a ) and [ fig:4](c).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    let us now compare these results to the band structure of the mismatched model . as mentioned in the introduction , the band structure of such a supercell is folded into its smaller bz . in order to recover the primitive cell picture of the band structure of au - supported mos@xmath0",
    ", we have calculated the so - called effective band structure ( ebs ) for this system . to help differentiate between mos@xmath0 and au bands , fig .",
    "[ fig:6](a ) shows the band structure for the au(111 ) slab ( without the mos@xmath0 layer ) unfolded on the primitive cell of mos@xmath0(0001).the intensity in the ebs plots for an energy interval @xmath44 and a @xmath15-vector of the primitive cell depends on the number of states of the supercell that have the same character as the primitive cell k - vector in that energy interval , i.e. that are related by the unfolding operator @xcite .",
    "unfolding the band structure of the au(111 ) supercell on the primitive cell of mos@xmath0(0001 ) results in an ebs with several bands , which shows that despite the mismatch , there are states of the au(111 ) slab that have a similar character as the primitive cell of mos@xmath0(0001 )",
    ". in particular , the @xmath19-band continuum of au appears diffuse below @xmath22 - 2.0ev and several bands cross the fermi level , some of which have minima at @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that one of these bands - probably the one with the minima closest to the fermi level - corresponds to the surface state of au(111 ) .",
    "however , the energy of the surface state of au(111 ) is not well - reproduced and this is due to the model used . for this mismatched model , the au(111 ) surface",
    "is represented by just four atomic layers whose structure is fixed to their truncated bulk positions . using a much thicker au(111 ) slab model and relaxing its structure would correctly reproduce the surface state , but such calculations would be too computationally demanding .",
    "in addition , it should be noted again that the unfolding is done on the unit cell of mos@xmath0(0001 ) and this means that the unfolded band structure does not exactly correspond to that of the au(111 ) primitive cell .",
    "the ebs for the mos@xmath0/au(111 ) mismatched model in fig .",
    "[ fig:6](b ) shares most of the vbm features of the band structure of the on - top matched model .",
    "the position of relevant mos@xmath0 bands has been indicated in fig  [ fig:6](b ) by using the same labels ( vb1 , vb2 , and cb1 ) as in in figs .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) and [ fig:4](c ) , to help differentiating between au and mos@xmath0 states .",
    "the characteristic spin - split ( by 151mev ) bands at @xmath1 ( vb1 ) are clearly visible , whereas bands with lower energy ( vb2 ) merge with the au @xmath19-band , becoming more diffuse closer to @xmath2 and practically disappear .",
    "the same states found crossing the fermi level in the ebs of the bare au(111 ) can also be recognized in the presence of the mos@xmath0 layer , but shifted towards higher energies .",
    "this is not surprising given the n - doping of the mos@xmath0 layer , which leads to a concomitant p - doping of au .",
    "interestingly , the interaction of vb2 with one of the au bands not only shifts the latter towards higher energies but also leads to avoided crossings between these bands near @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the mixing of vb2 with au states at @xmath2 destroys the local maximum of vb2 at @xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that the interaction with the au substrate leads to vb2 having two local maxima near @xmath2 instead of just the maximum right at @xmath2 characteristic of free - standing sl mos@xmath0 .",
    "this is consistent with the arpes spectra , where the vbm is hardly discernible at @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the band gap at @xmath1 from the ebs is 1.61ev , which is very similar to those calculated for the free - standing monolayer ( 1.60ev ) or for the on - top matched mos@xmath0/au(111 ) model ( 1.58ev ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that the choice of model does not affect the fundamental band gap at @xmath1 .",
    "in summary , arpes and sts and first principles calculations have been used to study the electronic structure of epitaxial single - layer mos@xmath0 on au(111 ) .",
    "we find that the interaction with a metallic support strongly distorts the vbm at @xmath2 and reduces the fundamental band gap at @xmath1 with respect to a free - standing layer .",
    "the resulting band gap is measured by sts to be ( @xmath45)ev , which is in relatively good agreement with the ( @xmath46)ev determined by time - resolved arpes @xcite .",
    "our dft calculations yield a smaller band gap of 1.61  ev and reveal that the mo 4@xmath19 states forming the vbm at @xmath1 of the single layer do not hybridize with the au(111 ) substrate .",
    "this is due to the position of the mos@xmath0 vbm which does not overlap with the au bands , and the central position of the mo atoms in the mos@xmath0 layer . in turn",
    ", the formation of au - s bonds leads to a strong hybridization of the s 3@xmath47 orbitals with the @xmath19 band of au , which causes a distortion of the mos@xmath0 vbm at @xmath2 .",
