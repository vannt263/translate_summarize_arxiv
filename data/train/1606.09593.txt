    "invigorated by @xcite , the methods from the conformal bootstrap have led , over recent years , to significative progress in the understanding of conformal field theories in dimensions higher than two .",
    "the conformal bootstrap program consists in the study of conformal field theory from consistency conditions , namely , the structure of the operator algebra and crossing symmetry , unitarity and symmetries of the theory .",
    "this has led to a wide spectrum of results for the cft data , both numeric as well as analytic .",
    "an interesting question is which conformal field theories admit a holographic dual , and for those who do , how does the geometry emerge from the cft .",
    "conformal bootstrap methods where used in @xcite in order to argue that any conformal field theory with a large @xmath7 expansion and a parametrically large gap in the spectrum of anomalous dimensions admits a dual local bulk theory .",
    "this was further developed in @xcite . in the simplest",
    "set - up it is assumed that the spectrum at @xmath8 contains a single - trace scalar operator of dimension @xmath9 , and double trace operators of dimension @xmath10 , while any other single trace operators have a parametrically large dimension @xmath11 .",
    "the authors then consider the four point correlator of the single trace operator and construct solutions consistent with crossing symmetry and the structure of the ope to order @xmath12 .",
    "these solutions are then shown to be in one to one correspondence with local interactions in a scalar effective field theory in the bulk .",
    "a cft that satisfies the conditions above is @xmath0 sym . in @xmath0",
    "scft the stress energy tensor sits in a half - bps multiplet , whose superconformal primary is a single trace operator @xmath13 of dimension two .",
    "the crossing relation for the four - point correlator can be expressed as a relation for the intermediate _ unprotected _ operators present in the ope @xmath14 , see @xcite . at @xmath8",
    "the spectrum of unprotected operators contains towers of double trace operators as described above .",
    "furthermore at large @xmath15 all unprotected single trace operators acquire a large scaling dimension .",
    "while this theory has a well known gravity dual , it is an interesting question how much of the structure of this dual theory can be recovered purely from cft considerations . in @xcite",
    "we applied the ideas of @xcite to @xmath0 sym and constructed four - point correlators consistent with crossing symmetry and the structure of the ope at order @xmath12 . in this case",
    ", the solutions must contain the _ supergravity _ term .",
    "in addition , crossing allows for a tower of solutions again in one to one correspondence with interactions in a bulk effective field theory .",
    "consider a generic bulk effective field theory of a massless scalar field in @xmath16    @xmath17    as already mentioned , each interaction term corresponds to a solution to the crossing conditions of the cft at order @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , each term will lead to a contribution , proportional to @xmath18 , etc , to the anomalous dimensions of double trace operators :    @xmath19    from the point of view of an @xmath4 effective field theory the coefficients @xmath18 , etc are not unconstrained . on one hand ,",
    "non - renormalizable interactions are expected to be suppressed by an extra scale , which should correspond to @xmath20 , and the precise power of @xmath20 should follow from dimensional analysis , see @xcite . on the other hand causality constraints enforce a specific sign for some of the couplings .",
    "for instance , unless @xmath21 the effective theory can not be uv - completed , see @xcite .",
    "this constraint will then lead to a corresponding constraint for the _ sign _ of the contribution to the anomalous dimension @xmath22 proportional to @xmath23 .    from the point of view of the cft , however , the coefficient in front of each solution to the crossing equations ( and its sign ) , is unconstrained . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the constraints arising from the point of view of effective field theory , together with the constraints from causality obtained in @xcite , lead to either a negative or suppressed correction to the anomalous dimension of twist four operators , in the regime of large @xmath24 .",
    "this is consistent with the numeric bounds found in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was also seen that the constraints arising from causality alone did not necessarily imply a negative contribution to the anomalous dimension of all twist four operators .    at any extent , a purely cft handle of the coefficients @xmath25 etc ,",
    "is hard to achieve .",
    "part of the problem is that in the approaches of @xcite and @xcite the constraints of crossing symmetry are implemented , but the constraints of unitarity are lost at order @xmath12 . in a beautiful paper , hartman and collaborators have analysed causality constraints in conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "in particular , they have shown that @xmath21 also follows from cft considerations .",
    "this in turn leads to the correct sign for the anomalous dimensions of twist four , spin two , double trace operators .    in this paper",
    "we make the following simple observation . in the treatment @xcite",
    ", it was assumed that the dimension of all unprotected single trace operators was very large . in @xmath0 sym",
    "this will happen for large @xmath24 .",
    "in the present paper we relax this assumption and assume that single trace operators arise in the ope @xmath14 at order @xmath12 .",
    "due to unitarity such new contributions appear with a definite positive sign .",
    "we find it convenient to work in mellin space @xcite , with the correlator given by    @xmath26    the presence of a new intermediate operator of twist @xmath27 in the direct channel leads to extra single - poles in the mellin expression for the correlator @xmath28 we consider non - polynomial solutions consistent with crossing symmetry and the correct analytic structure of the mellin representation .",
    "we then study the contribution from such solutions to the anomalous dimensions of double trace twist four operators .",
    "we show that for intermediate twist higher than four , @xmath29 , the contribution is always negative .",
    "the basic reason behind this is certain positivity condition for mack polynomials .",
    "this in turn leads to a positivity condition for a slice of the mellin amplitude , in the regime in which the twist of all unprotected single trace operators is higher than four : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are continuous hahn polynomials . in constructing the non - polynomial solutions for higher spin exchange",
    "there is always the ambiguity of adding regular polynomial terms .",
    "these ambiguous terms may in principle spoil the positivity condition , however we show that the same positivity condition follows if we assume the mellin amplitude has the correct regge behaviour .",
    "this condition implies the anomalous dimension of double trace twist four operators is always negative and explains the numeric results observed in @xcite .",
    "we then consider the limit of very large @xmath27 .",
    "we show that in this limit the solutions corresponding to the exchange of single trace scalar operators give rise to the tower of polynomial solutions considered in @xcite , with higher and higher order terms suppressed by powers of @xmath27 .",
    "the structure of this expansion exactly agrees with the structure proposed in @xcite based on effective field theory .",
    "in addition , the overall signs are fixed , such that the contribution to the dimension of twist - four double trace operators is negative .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for the exchange of operators with spin , assuming the polynomial ambiguities do not spoil the large twist limit .",
    "it is instructive to consider the flat space limit of the mellin amplitude .",
    "causality constraints impose certain positivity conditions for the forward limit of the flat space s - matrix @xcite .",
    "these constraints have a very similar form to the positivity constraints for the mellin amplitude mentioned above . finally , we consider the large @xmath32 behaviour of @xmath22 .",
    "the spectrum of operators should be such that in the flat space limit the virasoro - shapiro amplitude is recovered .",
    "this result can be used to write down the leading large @xmath32 behaviour of @xmath22 to all orders in @xmath33 .",
    "a generic growth in @xmath22 leads to a divergence in the lorentzian correlator .",
    "this divergence signals the locality of the bulk theory . by using the above behaviour for @xmath22 a leading order expression for such divergence",
    "is given .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section two",
    "we consider a family of solutions consistent with crossing symmetry and the exchange of single trace operators .",
    "we show that these solutions lead to a negative contribution to the anomalous dimension of twist four operators in a specific regime .",
    "the reason behind this is certain positivity property for mack polynomials that lead to a positivity condition for a slice of the mellin amplitude .",
    "we then show that the same condition follows from requiring the correct regge behaviour . in section three",
    "we consider several instructive limits of the mellin amplitude and the solutions of section two .",
    "namely , the large twist limit of the non - polynomial solutions and the flat space limit of the mellin amplitude .",
    "moreover , we study the large @xmath32 behaviour of the anomalous dimensions of double trace operators and the lorentzian singularities this leads to .",
    "we end with some conclusions and open problems .",
    "we defer some technical details to the appendices .",
    "in this paper we will consider a specific correlator in four - dimensional @xmath0 sym . in this theory",
    "the stress tensor sits in a half - bps multiplet , whose superconformal primary @xmath13 is a scalar operator of protected dimension two , which transforms in the @xmath34 of the @xmath35 @xmath36symmetry group .",
    "conformal invariance implies    @xmath37    where the sum runs over the six representations present in the tensor product @xmath38 and we have introduced the standard cross ratios @xmath39 superconformal ward identities relate the contributions from different representations @xmath40 and allow us to write all contributions in terms of a single function @xmath41 .",
    "the ope @xmath14 contains both , operators in long multiplets as well as operators in ( semi-)short multiplets @xcite .",
    "consequently @xmath41 admits the decomposition    @xmath42    where @xmath43 the sum runs over unprotected superconformal primary operators , singlet of @xmath35 , with even lorentz spin @xmath44 and scaling dimension @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath45 denotes the square of the ope coefficients .",
    "the contribution from superconformal descendants is taken into account by the superconformal blocks @xmath46 , with @xmath47 where we have introduced @xmath48 .",
    "it is furthermore convenient to decompose @xmath49 into its born approximation ( free theory ) , which we denote by @xmath50 , plus a quantum contribution .",
    "the born expression does not depend on the coupling , is explicitly known and it admits an expansion around @xmath8 :    @xmath51    while the quantum correction vanishes in the limit @xmath8 and starts at order @xmath12 .",
    "hence we write @xmath52 invariance of the full correlator under the exchange of any two operators leads to crossing symmetry relations . @xmath50 mixes with @xmath53 while @xmath54 satisfies crossing relations by itself : @xmath55 at @xmath8 the space of intermediate states is spanned by double trace operators of the schematic form @xmath56 , of spin @xmath44 and dimension @xmath57 . the leading term @xmath58 fixes the ope coefficients at leading order :    @xmath59    next we would like to consider the correlator in a large @xmath7 expansion and look for solutions consistent with crossing symmetry and the ope expansion to order @xmath12 .",
    "the dimensions and ope coefficients of double trace operators admit an expansion @xmath60 the @xmath12 term @xmath61 has a contribution which for small @xmath62 behaves as @xmath63 however , for @xmath64 the cpw decomposition ( [ gloncpw ] ) does not contain operators of twist two .",
    "hence , there should be a corresponding term in @xmath54 which cancels this contribution .",
    "this is given by the supergravity result @xmath65 , where the @xmath66-functions are defined for instance in @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following anomalous dimension and correction to the ope coefficients of the double trace operators    @xmath67    in addition we can add any solution to the homogeneous crossing relations consistent with the structure of the cpw decomposition . in order to proceed , we will assume that the correlator at order @xmath12 admits a mellin representation @xcite    @xmath68    where the integration contours are over the imaginary axis shifted by a small positive real part .",
    "the crossing relations in mellin space simply read    @xmath69    it is convenient to introduce an extra variable @xmath70 , such that @xmath71 . crossing symmetry",
    "then implies that the mellin expression is completely symmetric under permutation in the variables @xmath72 . in this language",
    "the supergravity solution corresponds to @xmath73 the extra tower of solutions considered in @xcite is simply given by completely symmetric polynomials in the variables @xmath74 .",
    "note that the prefactor in the definition of the mellin expression contains poles at @xmath75 , which correspond to the twist of double trace operators . a polynomial solution @xmath76 will not add new poles but it will change the residues of the poles corresponding to double twist operators , giving a contribution to their anomalous dimension and ope coefficients .      when considering @xmath12 corrections to a four - point correlator , two things can happen .",
    "1.- the dimension and the ope coefficients of the double trace operators acquire a correction of order @xmath12 ; 2.- new , single trace , operators may appear in the ope .",
    "the new operators will enter with their classical dimension at leading order , since their ope coefficient is already of order @xmath12 .",
    "in @xmath0 sym at large @xmath7 and finite @xmath24 , both things happen .",
    "let us assume that at order @xmath12 a new operator , of twist @xmath27 and spin @xmath44 , arises in the ope of the two external operators , with corresponding ope coefficient @xmath77 .",
    "an important point is that due to unitarity    @xmath78    @xmath54 should contain a term corresponding to the exchange of the new operator : @xmath79 while the expression in mellin space should possess a corresponding pole    @xmath80    as shown in appendix [ singlepoleunitarity ] having a single pole ( or a finite number of them ) for generic , not even integer @xmath27 , is not consistent with unitarity .",
    "more precisely , one needs to include the tower of poles corresponding to the descendants of the new operator . at these poles    @xmath81",
    "the residues at the poles are fixed by the proper expression for the super conformal blocks in mellin space , given by    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is a symmetric polynomial of degree @xmath44 , defined in appendix [ mack ] , and essentially coincides with the mack polynomial . note that the second gamma function in the numerator has poles at the locations    @xmath84    corresponding to the primary operator plus all its descendants . given ( [ cbmellin ] ) we find :    @xmath85      let us start with the simplest example of a scalar primary operator of dimension @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding mellin representation contains a pole :    @xmath87    the minimal solution consistent with crossing symmetry and the pole structure is @xmath88 where recall @xmath71 .",
    "we are interested in computing the contribution from such a solution to the anomalous dimension of twist four operators . here",
    "we will follow a brute force approach : we will compute the corresponding solution in space - time and then perform a cpw expansion .",
    "let us call the space time expression @xmath89 .",
    "we are interested in the terms proportional to @xmath90 in a small @xmath62 expansion :    @xmath91    plugging @xmath92 into the mellin integral we can express @xmath93 as a sum over residues . for a function @xmath94 without extra poles    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the digamma function . in this case",
    "@xmath97 so that we need to add the contribution from the pole at @xmath98 .",
    "the relevant sums can be performed with some effort .",
    "the final answer is a complicated expression , involving lerch transcendents , but it admits an expansions around @xmath99 : @xmath100 where the general coefficient can be written as follows : @xmath101 with @xmath102 a polynomial in @xmath86 such that @xmath103 for large @xmath86 .",
    "note that this fixes the polynomial uniquely .",
    "having computed the solution in space time we can perform the cpw decomposition :    @xmath104    where the collinear conformal block @xmath105 is the small @xmath62 limit of the full block .",
    "for instance , for spin zero we find :    @xmath106    where we have rewritten the coefficient @xmath107 in terms of the ope coefficient @xmath108 .",
    "it is instructive to study @xmath109 as a function of @xmath86 , see figure [ gamma00 ] .     from the symmetric exchange of a scalar primary , in units of @xmath108 .",
    "[ gamma00],width=336 ]    we observe something very interesting . while the contribution to @xmath109 can be positive for @xmath110 , it is always negative for @xmath111 . in order to draw this conclusion we used the fact that @xmath108 is positive due to unitarity .",
    "one can also compute the contributions to @xmath112 for @xmath113 , although the results are very lengthy to be reproduced here , and we have not managed to find a closed form expression . from the explicit results",
    "one observes that the correction to @xmath112 for @xmath114 is always negative .",
    "an interesting limit is that of large spin . the simplest way to compute it is along the lines of @xcite .",
    "given the analytic structure of the mellin amplitude the space time expression contains a term    @xmath115    for @xmath110 this gives a divergence , which can be reproduced only with the correct behaviour for @xmath112 at large @xmath44 .",
    "we obtain    @xmath116    this precisely agrees with the results of @xcite , upon specific shifts corresponding to the fact that we are dealing with superconformal blocks .    as already mentioned , a mellin amplitude with a finite number of generic poles is not consistent with unitarity .",
    "hence , it is important to extend the computation above in order to include the whole tower of descendants .      in the following we will generalise the previous computation to intermediate operators with spin , and including the whole tower of descendants . as a consequence of unitarity",
    ", we will see that the sign of the contributions to the anomalous dimensions of twist four operators has a definite sign , as for the simple model above .",
    "we propose the following mellin representation given the exchange of an operator of spin @xmath44 and twist @xmath27 :    @xmath117    where @xmath118 must be adjusted such as to obtain the correct contribution in space - time :    @xmath119    and @xmath120 is the positive ope coefficient of the single trace operator .",
    "@xmath121 is a completely symmetric polynomial of degree @xmath122 which can not be fixed simply by requiring the correct analytic structure .",
    "note that each of the three pieces in parentheses has the same poles and residues as the conformal block but differs by regular terms.this operation was also considered in @xcite , it corresponds to the exchange of a particle in @xmath4 and it leads to a polynomially bounded mellin expression ( while the conformal block is not ) .",
    "in addition , we have the ambiguity of adding a symmetric polynomial @xmath121 of degree @xmath122 . in the following discussion",
    "we will set this polynomial to zero .",
    "we will come back to this issue later , but note that in the case of a scalar exchange there is no such ambiguity .",
    "the solution can be written as the sum of three pieces ( corresponding to exchanges in the @xmath123 channels ) .",
    "@xmath124    for each spin , the above sum can be performed explicitly .",
    "for instance , for the exchange of a scalar operator plus all its tower of descendants we obtain    @xmath125    and similar expressions for operators with higher spin .",
    "we would like to compute the contribution from such a solution to the anomalous dimension of twist four operators .",
    "finding analytic expressions in this case is harder than before , so that we find it convenient to follow an alternative route .",
    "it can be shown , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , that given a mellin amplitude @xmath76 , without poles at @xmath126 , the contribution to the anomalous dimension of twist four operators is given by    @xmath127    where the contour of integration runs along the imaginary axis and @xmath128 is a special case of the continuous hahn polynomial , see @xcite .",
    "we can then plug the solutions in mellin space and compute , numerically , the corresponding contribution to the anomalous dimension of twist four operators of different spin .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the results for intermediate single trace operators of spin zero and two .     and",
    "@xmath129 from the exchange of an intermediate operator of spin zero , in units of the positive ope coefficient .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath112 with @xmath130 is very similar to @xmath129 .",
    "[ spin0],width=624 ]    , @xmath129 and @xmath131 from the exchange of an intermediate operator of spin two , in units of the positive ope coefficient .",
    "[ spin2],width=624 ]    the results can be summarised as follows .",
    "a new single - trace operator of twist higher than four always leads to a _ negative _ contribution to the anomalous dimension of twist - four operators .",
    "when exchanging an operator of spin @xmath132 only the contribution to @xmath133 can be positive , provided the twist of the operator is smaller than four .",
    "as we have seen above , when considering a new single - trace operator entering at order @xmath12 in the cpw decomposition , the contribution to the anomalous dimensions of double trace operators of leading twist has a definite sign .",
    "this is related to certain positivity properties of mack polynomials @xmath134 .",
    "it is simpler to consider the @xmath135channel contribution from the exchange of an operator of twist @xmath27 and spin @xmath44 . in this case , the relevant polynomial is @xmath136 , since only the pole at @xmath126 contributes .",
    "the contribution to the anomalous dimension @xmath133 is proportional to    @xmath137    where the polynomials",
    "@xmath138 have been introduced in ( [ hans ] ) .",
    "it can be explicitly checked that for @xmath139 the mack polynomials @xmath140 reduce precisely to @xmath138 , up to a proportionality factor . for @xmath141",
    "the following positivity condition can be verified :    @xmath142    while the equality is satisfied for @xmath139 and @xmath143 . on the other hand ,",
    "the above integral is identically zero for @xmath144 .",
    "an equivalent formulation of the above positivity condition is the statement that mack polynomials @xmath140 admit a decomposition :    @xmath145    where @xmath146 for @xmath141 .",
    "let us assume we are in a regime in which the twist of all single trace unprotected operators is higher than four .",
    "the mellin expression is a meromorphic function with single poles corresponding to exchanged operators .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the mellin transform admits an analogous decomposition .",
    "more precisely :    @xmath147    where @xmath148 .",
    "this would lead to a negative anomalous dimension for all twist four double trace operators .",
    "since the mellin amplitude is symmetric under exchange of the mellin variables , this can also be written as    @xmath149    for instance , one can explicitly check that this holds for the supergravity term .",
    "an important comment is in order .",
    "the relations that have led to ( [ positivity ] ) have been shown for the case of a scalar exchange . in the case of intermediate operators with spin",
    "we have set certain ambiguous polynomial to zero , which could , in principle spoil the positivity properties .. assuming this does not happen , we can propose a slightly stronger result .",
    "let us call @xmath150 the minimum twist for single - trace operators of spin @xmath44 .",
    "if we are in a regime in which @xmath151 for all @xmath152 , then ( [ positivity ] ) holds with @xmath153 positive .",
    "this will lead to negative @xmath154 for @xmath152 . in the following",
    "we will argue that the same positivity condition ( [ positivity ] ) , together with its stronger version , follows from different considerations .",
    "in all the examples studied so far we have verified the positivity condition ( [ positivity ] ) for the mellin amplitude .",
    "let us see how this condition arises under general mild assumptions .",
    "assume the mellin amplitude @xmath155 displays regge behaviour for fixed @xmath156 and large @xmath157 .",
    "more precisely , let us assume that for a fixed large enough @xmath156 , @xmath155 goes to zero for large @xmath157 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath155 for that value of @xmath156 is given by a sum over poles with the correct residues .    @xmath158    where the sum runs over intermediate single - trace operators ( we have subtracted the supergravity contribution ) , with positive ope coefficients @xmath120 .",
    "note that this expression does not have any ambiguities .",
    "next , we ask how large does @xmath156 have to be . from the discussion above , it follows that the first pole for @xmath156 is at @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the twist of the single - trace operator with minimal twist .",
    "let us first assume we are in a regime in which @xmath161 . then ( [ regge ] )",
    "should also hold for @xmath162 .",
    ", so that this behaviour holds for @xmath163 in our conventions .",
    "] in this case we can write    @xmath164    one can explicitly check that the combination @xmath165 is non - negative .",
    "furthermore , the coefficients @xmath120 are positive due to unitarity . finally , the combination    @xmath166    admits a decomposition in terms of continuous hahn polynomials with positive coefficients . assuming that the spectrum is such that the sum over @xmath27 and @xmath44 converges , the positivity condition ( [ positivity ] ) then follows . the stronger version of the positivity condition can be understood as follows .",
    "let us assume we are in a regime in which @xmath167 for @xmath113 but @xmath168 . in this case , the mellin amplitude at @xmath162 will not fall at infinity , but tend to a constant .",
    "this extra constant term may affect the sign of @xmath169 in ( [ positivity ] ) , but it will not affect the others . if we now assume that also @xmath170 , then we will have an extra constant plus a quadratic term in @xmath157 at infinity .",
    "this may affect the sign of @xmath171 but not the others .",
    "and so on .      let us focus our attention in twist four double trace operators .",
    "their scaling dimension at order @xmath12 is given by    @xmath172    where we have included the supergravity result and @xmath154 corresponds to the contribution from the rest of the solution to the crossing relations .",
    "in a regime in which the twist of all single - trace operators is higher than four , we obtained the positivity condition ( [ positivity ] ) .",

    "what are the consequences for the spectrum of leading twist operators ?",
    "let us focus in a given spin .",
    "if @xmath150 is smaller than four , then this will be the minimal twist for that spin . if , on the other hand , @xmath151 , then the minimal twist will be given by @xmath173 , with @xmath174 given above .",
    "since we have argued that @xmath154 is always negative , then @xmath175 provides an upper bound for the minimal twist .",
    "this exactly agrees with the numerical bounds observed in @xcite .",
    "in order to make contact with the results of @xcite we would like to consider a limit in which the dimension of the unprotected single trace operators becomes very large . in @xmath0 sym",
    "this happens for large @xmath24 .",
    "hence , we would like to consider the solutions constructed in the previous section , and study them as @xmath27 becomes very large , for finite values of the mellin variables @xmath72 .",
    "this limit is very similar to the flat space limit studied in @xcite , although in that limit the mellin variables are also large . as in that case",

    "let us make the following interesting remark .",
