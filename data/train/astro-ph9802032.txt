    "old neutron stars ( onss ) , i.e. neutron stars which have evolved beyond the pulsar phase , are expected to be quite a large galactic population counting as many as @xmath2 objects .",
    "ostriker , rees , & silk ( 1970 ) were the first to suggest that accretion of the interstellar medium ( ism ) may produce enough luminosity to make the closest stars observable and that onss may contribute to the soft x  ray background .",
    "more recently , treves , & colpi ( 1991 ) and blaes , & madau ( 1993 ) have shown that several thousands onss should be present in the rosat all sky survey .",
    "rather optimistic predictions for the number of detectable sources were also presented by madau , & blaes ( 1994 ) and colpi , campana , & treves ( 1993 ) for onss embedded in giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) and by zane _",
    "( 1996 ) for onss in the solar proximity .",
    "however , despite the intense observational efforts , the search for onss produced , up to now , just a handful of candidates , out of which only two , rx j18653.5 - 3754 ( walter , wolk , & neuhuser 1996 ) and rx j0720.4 - 3125 ( haberl _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , 1997 ) , seem indeed promising .",
    "moreover , recent analyses of rosat fields in the direction of gmcs ( belloni , zampieri , & campana 1996 ; motch _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) placed rather stringent upper limits on the number of onss in rosat images . in all these cases , the predicted number of onss turns out to be too close to the observed number of non optically identified sources ( noids ) which should comprise many other types of objects , like white dwarfs , active coronae and agns . in the field investigated by motch _",
    ", for example , @xmath0 sources should be detectable above 0.02 count@xmath3 ( zane _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) while the number of noids , at the same limiting flux , is 8 .",
    "since these are sites where accretion should be the most effective , observations seem to suggest that current theoretical predictions are in excess of at least a factor @xmath4 510 .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out by zane _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) that most optimistic models produce a source density of @xmath5 deg@xmath6 in rosat pspc pointings at the limiting flux of @xmath7 count @xmath3 , embarrassingly close to the average density of noids , @xmath8 deg@xmath6 .",
    "a even more dramatic reduction of the number of onss could follow from the recent investigation of rosat sources in dark clouds and high latitude molecular clouds by danner ( 1996 ) .",
    "for these fields predictions seem to be in excess by a factor @xmath9    although the paucity of onss may be partly related to the heating of the ism by the source itself ( blaes , warren , & madau 1995 ) , it could be also closely connected to the properties of nss at birth and/or to the long term evolution of their physical parameters .",
    "present estimates on the observability of onss rely on a number of physical hypotheses concerning the velocity distribution of pulsars at birth and the evolution of the magnetic field ( e.g. treves , & colpi 1991 ; blaes , & madau 1993 ; colpi , campana , & treves 1993 ; zane _ et al .",
    "the velocity distribution of onss was derived from the evolution , over the lifetime of the galaxy , of the pulsar velocity distribution of narayan , & ostriker ( 1990 , see also paczyski 1990 ) while a relic magnetic field @xmath10 g was assumed a priori .",
    "disappointingly , both the velocity distribution of nss and the long  term evolution of the magnetic field are still affected by large uncertainties which make them highly controversial issues .",
    "the actual number of detectable onss depends crucially on the number of low velocity neutron stars , which are those accreting at the highest rate .",
    "this , in turn , is directly related to the ns velocity distribution at birth .",
    "lyne , & lorimer ( 1994 ) and hansen , & phinney ( 1998 ) derived a pulsar velocity distribution containing fewer slow objects than in narayan , & ostriker ( 1990 ) , but this result is in contrast with other recent investigations by hartman ( 1997 ) and hartman _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) , which indicate that the number of pulsars with @xmath11 kms@xmath12 is the same as in narayan & ostriker or even higher .",
    "observations show that neutron stars with magnetic fields @xmath13 g , possibly @xmath14 g , are definitely present in lmxbs and in millisecond pulsars , suggesting that the magnetic field have decayed in these systems . instead",
    ", no firm conclusions have been reached yet for isolated objects ( see e.g. srinivasan 1997 ; wang 1997 ) .",
    "theoretical results are far from being univocal and predict either exponential / power  law field decay ( ostriker & gunn 1969 ; sang & chanmugam 1987 ; goldreich & reisenegger 1992 ; urpin , chanmugam & sang 1994 ; miri 1996 ; urpin , & muslimov 1992 ) or little or no decay at all within the age of the galaxy ( romani 1990 ; srinivasan _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ; goldreich & reisenegger 1992 ; pethick , & sahrling 1995 ; see also lamb 1991 for a revue ) .",
    "statistical analyses based on observations of isolated radio pulsars give equally ambiguous results ( narayan & ostriker 1990 ; sang & chanmugam 1990 ; bhattacharya _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , owing in part to the difficulty of treating selection effects ( lamb 1992 ) . at the present",
    ", there is no clear evidence of field decay during the pulsar phase , but this does not preclude the possibility of field decay over longer timescales .",
    "different approaches to pulsar statistics led , independently , to the conclusion that , if the magnetic field decays , then it probably does so over a timescale @xmath15 myr , well above the characteristic pulsar lifetime ( srinivasan 1997 , hartman _",
    "_ 1997 ; lorimer , bailes , & harrison 1997 ) .    very recently , however , wang ( 1997 ) and konenkov , & popov ( 1997 ) noticed that a substantial decay of the magnetic field should have occured precisely in the ons candidate rx j0720.4 - 3125 .",
    "this object may have nevertheless a different origin resulting from common envelope evolution in a binary system . in the last hypothesis the decay of the @xmath16field may have been induced by accretion ( see e.g.",
    "shibazaki _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; romani 1990 ) .    keeping in mind these uncertainties ,",
    "the case of rx j0720.4 - 3125 may provide , for the first time , evidence for a decay of the magnetic field in aging , isolated nss .",
    "if evolution leaves a relic field @xmath17 g a large fraction of the entire ns population is expected to accrete the ism , since major spin  down by propeller occured over the lifetime of the stars , as pointed out by blaes , & madau ( 1993 ) .",
    "actually , previous investigations assumed that _",
    "nearly all _ onss accrete from the ism ( see again treves , & colpi 1991 ; blaes , & madau 1993 ) . at the low rates typical of onss embedded in the ism , however , the conditions under which accretion is possible are rather stringent , since the inflowing gas may or may not penetrate inside the accretion and the alfven radii according to the star velocity , spin period and magnetic field . as a consequence",
    "the number of onss accreting today may depend sensibly on the distribution of the stellar parameters at birth but , even more , on the long  term variation of the spin and magnetic field .",
    "the aim of this investigation is to explore the role of the magnetic field evolution in affecting theoretical predictions for onss observability . in order to do this",
    ", we relax the assumption of a constant , relic magnetic field and consider a model in which spin evolution causes the core field to migrate to the crust where dissipation processes ( such as electron  phonon scatterings and scatterings on impurities ) drive the field decay ( see e.g. srinivasan _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ; urpin , & muslimov 1992 ) .",
    "several evolutionary tracks have been computed and the properties of the ons candidate rx j0720.4 - 3125 are easily recovered .",
    "we show that the paucity of onss detections can be accounted for if the magnetic field decays on a characteristic timescale @xmath18 yr .",
    "the approach presented here suggests that , in close analogy with what is done for pulsars , the study of onss statistics may reveal a promising probe for constraining the spin and magnetic field evolution of neutron stars .",
    "nss are widely believed to be borne with high magnetic fields , @xmath19 g , and very short rotational periods @xmath20 s. during the early phase of the evolution , magnetic dipole losses spin down the star at a rate which , in vacuo , is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the surface dipole field in units of 10@xmath23 g. the ns mass and radius have been assumed to be @xmath24 and @xmath25 km throughout .",
    "actually , isolated nss are surrounded by the diffuse interstellar medium , so the pulsar relativistic wind continues until the ram pressure of the infalling material exceeds the outflowing momentum flux at the accretion radius ( e.g. blaes , & madau 1993 ; treves , colpi , & lipunov 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "this occurs when the period exceeds a critical value @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the ons velocity in units of 10 km s@xmath12 , @xmath29 is the ism sound speed and @xmath30 the ism number density in @xmath31 . here and in the following the bondi formula for the accretion rate @xmath32 is used . for @xmath33",
    "the incoming gas can penetrate down to the alfven radius @xmath34 the interaction of matter with the magnetosphere prevents , however , accretion to go any further , because , for typical onss parameters , the alfven radius exceeds the corotation radius @xmath35 . since the flow is forced into superkeplerian rotation , angular momentum will be extracted and spin  down proceeds at a rate ( the propeller phase , illarionov , & sunyaev 1975 )    @xmath36    only when the period exceeds @xmath37 steady accretion onto the star surface can set in .",
    "> from equations ( [ dipoler ] ) , ( [ pcr ] ) , ( [ propeller ] ) and ( [ pac ] ) both the critical periods , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , as well as the spin  down rates , depend on the magnetic field .",
    "hence the overall picture of the ns evolution would change significantly if the magnetic field is itself evolving in time . in this paper",
    "we consider a simple decay model , in which the magnetic field is anchored to both the superfluid core and the crust , so that its evolution is primarily controlled by the star rotation ( see e.g. ding , cheng , & chau 1993 ; miri , & bhattacharya 1994 ) . a different model , in which the field is confined in the star crust will be briefly discussed in section 5 . in the present picture , the neutron vortices , carrying the angular momentum ,",
    "are pinned to the proton fluxoids .",
    "the radial drift of the vortices , induced by spin ",
    "down , causes the magnetic flux to migrate to the crust where ohmic dissipation occurs ( srinivasan 1990 ; srinivasan 1997 ) .",
    "the physics of the interaction between vortices and fluxoids is still uncertain , but , as shown by ding , cheng , & chau ( 1993 ) ( see also miri , & bhattacharya 1994 ) , the decay rate of the core field @xmath40 turns out to be approximately equal to the spin  down rate @xmath41 yielding @xmath42 .",
    "ohmic dissipation takes place in the crust inducing the decay of currents on a characteristic timescale @xmath43 ( see again ding , cheng , & chau 1993 ; miri , & bhattacharya 1994 ) .",
    "this results in the evolution equation for the surface magnetic field",
    "@xmath16 @xmath44 the crustal timescale @xmath43 depends on the mechanism responsible for ohmic dissipation and is , in general , a function of time . however , in the spirit of the simple model used here and because of the still poorly known details of the microphysics , we found more convenient to view @xmath43 as a constant which we vary to bracket uncertainties . from equation ( [ bsur ] )",
    "one can see that the core and surface fields evolve on the same timescale if @xmath43 is shorter than the spin  down time ( controlling the evolution of @xmath40 ) . in the opposite case ,",
    "the core field decays faster while the surface field relaxes to @xmath40 on the scale @xmath43 .",
    "in this section we follow the evolution of the spin and the surface field integrating numerically equations ( [ dipoler ] ) , ( [ propeller ] ) and ( [ bsur ] ) . at the onset of evolution , at @xmath45 yr , the neutron star is assumed to spin rapidly with a period @xmath46 s , while the initial value of the surface field is taken to be consistent with the narrow gaussian distribution ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) inferred from pulsar observations ( see e.g. bhattacharya _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) . accordingly , we restrict our analysis to values of @xmath49 in the range @xmath50 g. the initial core field @xmath51 is taken to be always equal to @xmath52 ( ding , cheng , & chau 1993 ) .",
    "the evolution is divided into three phases ( see e.g. blaes , & madau 1993 ; treves , colpi , & lipunov 1993 ; wang 1997 ) . as long as @xmath53 , rotational energy losses are due to magnetic dipole radiation and the behaviour of @xmath16 and @xmath54 is governed by equations ( [ dipoler ] ) and ( [ bsur ] ) . for @xmath55 , equation ( [ dipoler ] )",
    "is replaced with ( [ propeller ] ) to account for spin  down by propeller .",
    "since the latter depends on the accretion rate , we vary the star velocity @xmath56 and keep the ism density constant ( @xmath57 ) , in exploring different evolutionary tracks .",
    "the numerical integration is halted either when the period @xmath54 becomes equal to @xmath39 ( calculated with the current value of @xmath16 ) after a time @xmath58 or when @xmath59 yr , the age of the galaxy . as discussed by wang ( 1997 ) , during the accretion phase the mass loading of the field lines could become important in spinning down the star , because it increases the moment of inertia of the star / magnetosphere system . however , in the case of rx j0720.4 - 3125 and exponential decay , it only produces a small variation ( from 7.86 s to 8.39 s ) in the value of @xmath54 .",
    "since here we focus on the average properties of the ons population , we neglect this further source of spin  down , assuming that @xmath54 ( and , accordingly , @xmath40 ) is a constant for @xmath60 .",
    "the surface magnetic field , however , continues to decay and equation ( [ bsur ] ) gives @xmath61\\exp { \\left ( - { t - t_a    \\over \\tau_c } \\right ) } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath62 . in the following we consider different values of the decay time @xmath43 and discuss the ensuing evolutionary scenarios .",
    "although statistical studies of isolated radio pulsars indicate that little or no field decay occurs over the pulsar lifetime ( bhattacharya _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; lorimer , bailes , & harrison 1997 ) , values of @xmath63 yr can not be completely ruled out .",
    "anyhow , we find that rapid crustal field decay inhibits angular momentum losses to such an extent that virtually no ons would be accreting today , all of them would either be dead pulsars or stay forever in the propeller phase .",
    "quite the opposite happens if @xmath64 yr , a value large enough to mimic the case of no field decay in the population of onss . in this case",
    "most neutron stars enter the accretion stage remaining highly magnetized and rotating very slowly , with periods up to few days .",
    "we start our discussion examining in some detail the evolution of @xmath54 and @xmath16 for @xmath65 yr .",
    "figure 1a , b illustrates the history of a low velocity neutron star with @xmath66 and @xmath67 g. the endpoint of the evolution has properties similar to those of the neutron star in rx j0720.4 - 3125 ( wang 1997 )",
    ". as it can be seen , during the lifetime of the galaxy the star goes through all the three phases , pulsar , propeller and accretor , and may be visible at present as an accreting source .",
    "the situation is entirely different for a ns with higher speed , @xmath68 . in this case , after the initial loss of rotational energy by magnetic dipole radiation , the star enters the propeller phase , but has no time to spin down sufficiently to become an accretion  powered x  ray source because @xmath69 is too small to make braking effective .",
    "this means that nss borne with high kick velocities may undergo only the pulsar and propeller phases over their entire lifetime .",
    "neutron stars which become accretors arrive at the end of the propeller phase with a period @xmath70 and a surface field @xmath71 which depend on the accretion rate , and hence on the star velocity , once @xmath30 , @xmath49 and @xmath43 are fixed .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath71 and @xmath70 as functions of @xmath56 is shown in figures 2a , b where each curve corresponds to a different value of @xmath49 . in figure 2a",
    "triangles and squares mark the loci where @xmath72 and @xmath73 yr , respectively .",
    "as it can be seen , for each values of @xmath49 there exists a limiting velocity , @xmath74 , above which the time required to reach @xmath39 exceeds the age of the galaxy .",
    "clearly @xmath74 depends on @xmath49 : nss with large fields at birth can reach the accretion phase even if they move with comparatively large speed , while for weak initial fields rapidly moving objects remain in the propeller stage .",
    "we notice ( see figure 2a ) that as @xmath56 increases toward @xmath74 substantial field decay has occured before the accretion phase begins , and @xmath75 approaches @xmath76 g , irrespective of @xmath49 . for @xmath77 , @xmath75 represents the relic field , since @xmath78 the distribution of the periods is rather wide and ranges from few seconds to several minutes ( see figure 2b ) . for low values of @xmath49 ( bottom curve of figure 2b )",
    "@xmath39 monotonically increases with @xmath56 , while at larger @xmath79 @xmath80 exhibits a maximum .",
    "this is a not in contrast with equation ( [ pac ] ) because @xmath39 depends also on @xmath75 which , in turn , is a function of @xmath56 .    in our model the periods at @xmath81 coincide with those at @xmath82 , while this is not the case for the surface field because of further ohmic dissipation for @xmath83 .",
    "the distribution of the surface field at present , @xmath84 , is plotted together with the core field in figure 3a .",
    "as it appears from figure 3a , decay is fast enough to freeze the surface fields to the core field at @xmath81 .",
    "onss with spin periods @xmath85 minutes and low magnetic field ( @xmath86 g ) can be easily accommodated by the model for @xmath65 yr ( see figure 3b ) .",
    "ohmic dissipation of the crustal field on a scale @xmath87 yr speeds up the evolution to the final state of accretor .",
    "both losses by magnetic dipole braking and propeller slow down the ns effectively .",
    "consequently , @xmath74 takes higher values and also nss with large enough velocities can enter the accretion stage .",
    "spin periods vary between few seconds and several hours and , despite the longer crustal decay time , @xmath88 may be lower than for @xmath65 yr .",
    "this is because the larger spin  down rate produces a significant decay of the core field and there is enough time after the onset of accretion for the surface field to approach the core field .",
    "typical values of @xmath88 are between @xmath89 and @xmath14 g ( see figure 4a ) .",
    "we notice that for @xmath90 yr the period of rx j0720.4 - 3125 can not be reproduced along any of the evolutionary tracks ( see figure 4b ) .",
    "within our spin  induced field decay model , we now estimate the fraction of nss ( relative to the total number ) that are presently in the propeller , @xmath91 , and in the accretor phase , @xmath92 . to this end , we recall that only those stars having @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) are in the propeller ( accretor ) phase . @xmath91 and @xmath92 depend on the velocity distribution of onss @xmath95 , which changes during the evolution of the galaxy . starting from the pulsar distribution of narayan , & ostriker ( 1990 ) , blaes , & madau ( 1993 ) and zane _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) derived the present distribution function following the evolution of a large number of stars moving in the galactic potential .",
    "the current cumulative velocity distribution may be conveniently approximated as @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 gives the fraction of stars with @xmath100 .",
    "the stars enter the propeller phase at @xmath101 yr , so there have been time enough for their velocity distribution to evolve . in sections 2 and 3 , we neglected this effect and assumed that @xmath56 is constant in time .",
    "we judged this to be a minor flaw with respect to other sources of uncertainty present in our model , including the decay model itself .",
    "table 1 contains @xmath92 and @xmath91 for different @xmath43 and for @xmath67 .",
    "previous models relied on the hypothesis that _ all _ onss are currently accreting , i.e. @xmath102 . here",
    "we find that only for @xmath103 yr , most ( @xmath104 ) of the nss are now accreting .",
    "this figure drops significantly to @xmath105 if we allow for crustal field decay on a timescale @xmath106 yr .",
    "however , the fraction of potentially observable nss is not @xmath107 , but depends on the characteristics of the detector .",
    "here we refer to rosat , and the fourth column of table 1 gives the fraction @xmath108 of accreting nss with emission falling in the t  band ( 0.12.4 kev ) .",
    "the energy at which a blackbody spectrum peaks was taken as representative of the mean photon energy and the effective temperature of radiation was estimated considering polar cap emission ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "it is of interest to notice that , although the fraction of accreting nss increases with @xmath43 , the relative number of sources in band is smaller for @xmath90 yr .",
    "the reason is that the surface field has decayed more ( see figure 4a ) than in the case @xmath109 yr , so the emitted spectra are softer .",
    "we find that , for @xmath110 yr , @xmath108 clusters around @xmath111 .",
    "yet , this number can not be compared with previous figures on the number of detectable onss ( see treves , & colpi 1991 ; zane _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) since they evaluated the number of sources with a flux above the sensitivity threshold of rosat . in order to obtain a meaningful comparison ,",
    "we have computed the fraction @xmath112 of onss in the t  band , assuming a magnetic field of @xmath14 g , @xmath113 @xmath31 and blackbody polar cap emission .",
    "@xmath114 gives precisely the number of sources in the t  band in the spirit of previous models and @xmath115 is the ratio between the present and past predicted numbers .",
    "the values of @xmath116 are given in table 1 and indicate that the expected number is reduced by a factor @xmath117 for @xmath65 yr .",
    "@xmath116 is even smaller for @xmath90 yr owing to the more severe decay of the core field . for @xmath63",
    "yr , @xmath116 is as low as @xmath118 ; by contrast , @xmath116 exceeds unity for @xmath64 yr . we note that @xmath91 and @xmath107 are only very weakly dependent on the initial value of the period : models with larger values of @xmath119 give essentially the same figures .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the expected number of onss observable with rosat can be sensibly reduced if the star magnetic field decays on timescales @xmath17 yr . this is primarily due to the lower fraction of nss which are in the accretion phase now , but also to a softening of the spectra which may bring the peak of the emission outside rosat t ",
    "band if @xmath90 yr .",
    "it follows that , if the paucity of detected onss is to be explained in terms of a global reduction in the number of accretion  powered sources , decay times @xmath120 yr , should be invoked . for intermediate values of @xmath43 ,",
    "@xmath76 yr , the fraction of accreting onss is @xmath121 , too large to match observational limits , but only @xmath122 of the sources falls in the rosat t  band , yielding again an acceptable number of _ detectable _ objects .",
    "this last figure should be regarded as indicative , being based on the assumption that all sources emit a blackbody spectrum from the polar caps . if the decay time is @xmath123 yr or larger , spin  down by propeller is so effective that nearly all onss are accreting today . in this case",
    "the surface magnetic field is close to the initial value , @xmath124 g , and deviations from a pure blackbody spectrum are to be expected .",
    "unfortunately , no detailed radiative transfer calculations are available for accretion atmospheres onto magnetized nss , at least to our present knowledge .",
    "some hints may be , nevertheless , derived from the analysis of radiative transfer in cooling neutron stars atmospheres ( shibanov _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , since the input physics of the two model is quite similar .",
    "the emerging picture indicates that magnetic effects tend , somehow , to balance the hardening found by zampieri _",
    "( 1995 ) in the case of unmagnetized accretion atmospheres , so that , for @xmath124 g , spectra are , globally , not too different from a blackbody emitted by the polar caps . with this proviso , figures in table 1",
    "tell us that all accreting sources should be indeed within rosat t  bandpass and show that decay times @xmath125 yr provide a fraction of potentially detectable onss equal to that derived in previous investigations .",
    "our main conclusion is that models of spin  induced magnetic field decay with a crustal dissipation time shorter than the age of the galaxy are able to bring theoretical predictions of onss detectability closer to present observational limits .",
    "it is interesting to note that ohmic diffusion times between @xmath126 and @xmath14 yr can also explain the low values of @xmath16 observed in millisecond pulsars , which experienced spin induced field decay during binary evolution in wide low ",
    "mass systems ( miri , & bhattacharya 1994 ) .",
    "although our present results seem indeed to point to a decay of magnetic field in onss , a firmer conclusion may be reached once the number of sources actually present in rosat fields is computed evolving the onss distribution function together with the spin and the magnetic field .",
    "two other issues deserve further discussion . in computing the spin ",
    "down rate in the propeller phase the original expression of illarionov , & sunyaev ( 1975 ) was used .",
    "it should be noticed that the physics governing the propeller is rather complex and still far from a complete understanding .",
    "it has been shown ( see e.g. ghosh 1995 ) that the characteristic time for angular momentum losses strongly depends on the details of the accretion process and can be longer than what is assumed here .",
    "if the propeller is less efficient in braking the star , the number of accreting onss reduces further . on the other hand numerical simulations ( wang , & robertson 1985 ) seem to indicate that propeller spin  down can go even faster that in equation ( [ propeller ] ) .",
    "the second point concerns the field decay model . if the field is confined only in the stellar crust ( see e.g. urpin , & muslimov 1992 ) the emerging picture may change since the magnetic field is not coupled to the period . in the model of urpin , & muslimov @xmath43 is computed from the microphysics and varies in time , depending on the thermal evolution of the stellar crust .",
    "we have repeated the calculation using equation ( [ bsur ] ) with @xmath127 and @xmath43 estimated from figure 5 of urpin , & muslimov , and found that the number of accreting onss again reduces . even if the initial surface field is as large as @xmath128 g only @xmath129 of the ns population",
    "is the accretion phase now . on the opposite , an exponential decay of the surface field with @xmath130 yr , as inferred by pethick , & sahrling ( 1995 ) in the case of a non  vanishing core field ,",
    "do not seem to solve the problem of the excess of potentially visible onss .",
    "the conclusion that many onss should be in the propeller stage seem rather robust if the magnetic field decays over a characteristic @xmath131 yr , irrespective of the details of the model .",
    "is there a way to observe directly these objects ?",
    "the power associated to the propeller derives ultimately from the rotational energy , and therefore one can deduce that it should be smaller than that released by accretion of matter onto the star surface typically by a factor @xmath15 ( see e.g. treves , colpi , & lipunov 1993 ) .",
    "the accreted mass , however , could accumulate at the alfven radius until the pressure required to overcome the centrifugal barrier is built up , giving raise to recurrent episodes of accretion .",
    "if this is the case , onss in the propeller phase could be observed as transient sources ( treves , colpi , & lipunov 1993 ) .",
    "more definite predictions about the observational appearance of these sources , including spectral properties , luminosity , recurrence times , demand , however , for a more realistic modelling of the physics governing the propeller .",

    "<S> old neutron stars ( onss ) which have radiated away their internal and rotational energy may still shine if accreting the interstellar medium . despite their large number </S>",
    "<S> , only two promising candidates have been detected so far and rather stringent limits on their observability follow from the analysis of rosat surveys . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with optimistic theoretical estimates that predicted a large number of sources in rosat fields . </S>",
    "<S> we have reconsidered the issue of onss observability , accounting for the spin and magnetic field evolution over the neutron star lifetime . in the framework of a spin  induced field decay model , we show that the total number of onss which are , at present , in the accretion stage is reduced by a factor @xmath0 over previous figures if the characteristic timescale for crustal current dissipation is @xmath1 yr . </S>",
    "<S> this brings theoretical predictions much closer to observational limits . </S>",
    "<S> most onss should be at present in the propeller phase and , if subject to episodic flaring , they could be observable . </S>"
