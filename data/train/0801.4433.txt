    "reduction in the spatial dimensions in nanoparticles results in a number of interesting properties such as , for example , the widening of the band gap , reduction in melting temperature , increased magnetic moments etc .",
    "the fundamental understanding of the size dependence of properties of nanoparticles , i.e. at what size the quantum size effects set in , is important for tailoring these systems for possible nanotechnological applications .",
    "studies along these lines continue to be frontline research in nanoscience@xcite .",
    "fullerenes are hollow cages formed by sp@xmath8 bonded carbon atoms .",
    "they are finite analogues of graphene with 12 pentagonal defects that introduce curvature and make them closed structures .",
    "unlike the most nanoparticles however , fullerenes are distinctly different in that they have all the atoms on the surface whereas solid spherical nanoparticles have roughly n@xmath9 atoms on the surface .",
    "this feature results in rapid increase in their volume as the number of atoms ( i.e. its size ) increases . as dipole polarizability is proportional to volume",
    ", fullerenes are most suitable for investigating quantum size effects manifested in polarizability .",
    "the large dipole polarizability of carbon fullerenes compared to that of metallic or dielectric spheres of same size have been previously interpreted as quantum size effect @xcite .",
    "a number of studies on the polarizability of fullerenes have been devoted to understanding its size dependence@xcite .",
    "these studies have been mainly based on classical models or have employed drastic approximations to simplify the polarizability calculations . unfortunately , the predictions of these models are not consistent with each other and show rather large variance . for example , the various predictions of the polarizability of the c@xmath7 ( see table [ table : pol ] ) are : 7100 ( pariser - parr - pople model@xcite ) , 2726 ( bond - order - bond polarizability@xcite ) , 9548 ( penn model - linear response theory@xcite ) , 17817 ( tight binding@xcite ) . the predictions from different models of fullerene polarizabilities and associated quantum size effects differ by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "the most reliable methods to determine electronic structure are the first - principles - based quantum - chemical methods . in the preset work ,",
    "we use the first - principles density - functional methods to accurately determine the first order electric response of carbon fullerenes of sizes from c@xmath0 to c@xmath7 by computing their static dipole polarizabilities .",
    "these calculations provide the most accurate prediction of the dielectric response of fullerenes in the size range c@xmath0-c@xmath7 and show substantial quenching of quantum size effects by c@xmath5 in contrast to current understanding .",
    "moreover , the fullerene polarizabilities computed herein also provide an accurate input to the models used in determination of the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum for possible detection of of hyper - fullerene particles in space@xcite .",
    "the first essential step in obtaining an accurate estimate of polarizability of fullerene involves accurate determination of the fullerene structure .",
    "we optimized the geometry of carbon fullerenes using recent fully analytic and variational formulation of density functional ( adft ) theory@xcite .",
    "being free of numerical grids , the adft implementation is computationally very efficient and allows calculations of matrix elements and energies accurate to machine precision .",
    "its functional form is restricted but its space of atomic parameters is rich .",
    "it has been successfully used to study electronic properties of boron nitrides , aluminum nitride tubes@xcite , and provides dipole moments , total and atomization energies that are comparable to those obtained using some of the most sophisticated density functional models . in this work , we optimized the geometries of c@xmath0 , c@xmath2 , c@xmath3 , c@xmath5 , c@xmath6 , and c@xmath7 fullerenes from the 60@xmath10 family of icosahedral fullerenes .",
    "additionally , two fullerenes ( c@xmath1 and c@xmath4 ) from the 180@xmath10 family are also optimized .",
    "the structures ( cf . [ fig : str ] ) are optimized at the _ all _ electron level using the triple - zeta - quality ( 6 - 311 g * * ) orbital basis@xcite and an exchange - correlation basis set that includes @xmath11 functions , and the exchange - correlation parametrization that gives an exact c@xmath0 geometry@xcite .",
    "these approximations give accurate geometries in a very efficient manner , which we verified by reoptimizing the larger c@xmath2 fullerene using even larger nrlmol basis ( 35 basis functions per atom ) and using the more complex and popular perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "both models give identical c@xmath2 geometries within a root - mean - square value of 10@xmath12 a.u .",
    "for the forces .    for the polarizability calculations",
    "the fullerenes structures are held rigid i.e. , the ionic ( vibronic ) contribution to dipole polarizabilities is ignored .",
    "this is a tenable assumption as our earlier studies on c@xmath0 and c@xmath13 show that in fullerenes electronic part determines the total polarizability with negligible contributions from the ionic vibrations @xcite ."
