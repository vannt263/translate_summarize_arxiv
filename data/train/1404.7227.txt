    "buildings across the world contribute significantly to total energy usage .",
    "figure  [ fig : country_proportion ] shows the contribution of buildings to energy consumption in india , usa , china , korea and australia  @xcite .",
    "rapid rate construction of buildings presses the need to look into improving energy efficiency in buildings with a goal of decreasing overall energy footprint .",
    "thus , towards the vision of sustainability in the age of dwindling natural resources , buildings need to be made more energy efficient .",
    " measure twice and cut once\"- so goes the old adage . with this adage in mind and",
    "the goal of understanding building energy efficiency , collecting building energy data assumes prime importance .",
    "traditionally , building energy data included * monthly * electricity bills collected * manually * by the utility companies and other * sporadic * data such as energy audits .",
    "owing to the manual and sporadic nature of this collected data , the available data is very sparse and provides limited insights into building energy efficiency .",
    "buoyed by the success of data sets such as mnist  @xcite in instigating machine vision research , previous study  @xcite suggests that research in building energy domain can be spurred by availability of data sets . while previously deemed improbable , collection of such data sets has become increasingly common due to low cost sensing devices enabling * high resolution * and * automated * data collection .",
    "furthermore , governments and utilities across the world have started rolling out smart meters with an aim of developing a smart grid . beyond the envisioned applications by the government and the utilities ,",
    "this data can also be used for developing an understanding into building energy .",
    "smart meters typically report electricity consumption to the utility and to the end consumer at rates ranging from a reading every second to a reading every hour .",
    "commercial buildings are also increasingly managed with building management systems ( bms ) which control different sub - systems such as lighting and hvac .",
    "bms are computer based control systems for controlling and monitoring various building systems such as hvac and lighting and are typically used to manage commercial buildings .",
    "bms sense several spatially distributed points across the building to monitor parameters required for control action .",
    "buildings are also commonly equipped with ambient sensors for monitoring parameters such as light , temperature and humidity .",
    "these ambient sensors are often coupled with security systems to raise intruder alarm or to maintain healthy ambient conditions via thermostat or bms control . with the advent of smart meters , increased usage of bms and ease of availability and installation of ambient sensors , there is a now a deluge of building energy data .",
    "while collecting building energy data is easier than before , deployments can get increasingly hard to manage , especially when large number of sensors are deployed .",
    "however , previous research  @xcite has highlighted that building energy data can be obtained at different spatio - temporal granularities .",
    "this highlights the need for * optimal instrumentation * that can have different connotations for spatial and temporal domain . for spatial domain ,",
    "optimal instrumentation involves monitoring at a subset of locations while still being able to accurately predict at all the desired locations .",
    "for the temporal dimension , optimal instrumentation involves sampling at a lower resolution while still being able to predict at a higher temporal resolution .",
    "desired application may choose the optimal set of sensors considering cost - accuracy tradeoffs across these different granularities .",
    "traditionally , there exist multiple building subsystems such as security , networking , hvac and lighting , each performing their own operations in isolation .",
    "however , buildings are a unified ecosystem and optimal operations would require * interconnecting * these * sub - systems*. the combined information from the different sub - systems is greater than sum of individual information from each of the systems .",
    "once the systems are interconnected , data coming from diverse systems can be used to improve upon the decision making for optimal building operations . *",
    "inferred decision making * can help in identifying inefficiencies , raising alerts and suggest optimizations .",
    "traditionally data from within the system has been used for simple decision making e.g. motion sensor based lighting control .",
    "furthermore , utility companies previously relied on customers phone calls to detect power outages . however , utility companies can now leverage smart meter data from different homes to quickly detect power outages and plan accordingly .",
    "temporal patterns in the electricity consumption data  @xcite can be used to detect faulty operations , predict load profiles and optimize operations accordingly .",
    "spatial patterns in the electricity consumption can identify different electrical sub - systems and study their effect on aggregate consumption .",
    "the vast set of analysis possible further necessitates the importance of data sets collected from the real world which can be to used to simulate the effect of inferred decisions before performing optimizations .",
    "buildings constitute ecosystems involving interactions between the occupants , the physical and the cyber world  @xcite . the presence of occupants , each with their individual preferences makes the ecosystem even more complex .",
    "traditionally , the control decisions for building operation are taken at a central facility level assuming certain desired operating conditions without involving the occupants in decisions regarding desired conditions .",
    "such policies are bound to be energy inefficient and may cause occupant discomfort at times  @xcite . moreover",
    ", previous literature  @xcite suggests that energy unaware occupant behavior can add upto one - third to a building s energy performance .",
    "however , when empowered with actionable feedback , occupants may save upto 15% energy  @xcite .",
    "building occupants can also provide useful data such as comfortable temperature and light intensity levels , which can be used to optimally schedule the hvac systems .",
    "thus , various optimizations in the building energy ecosystem can be enabled by * involving occupants*.    all of optimal sensing from interconnected subsystems , resulting in decisions inferred from the rich dataset while involving the occupants will overall result in * intelligent operations*. such intelligent operations already exist but miss out one or more aspects discussed previously i.e. either they do not involve the occupants or are taken at a subsystem level without accounting for data from other subsystems in operation .",
    "thus , based on literature in building energy domain , we have identified these five crust areas also called five is which are as follows : i ) instrument optimally ; ii ) interconnect sub - systems ; iii ) inferred decision making ; iv ) involve occupants and v ) intelligent operations .",
    "figure  [ fig : building_energy ] summarizes the relationship amongst the 5 is of building energy which span across broad fields such as sensor networks , behavioral sciences , data science and control science",
    ". the interconnected nature of these 5 is makes the overall optimization of building energy efficiency a complex problem .",
    "for solving such a complex problem of intelligent building operations , rich data from across the diverse systems , together with smart algorithms for data inference and participatory engagement of occupants is critical .",
    "such rich datasets are now becoming a reality  @xcite .",
    "further , rich research exists in from recent times that address algorithms for data inference and understanding behavioral aspects of occupants feedback  @xcite .",
    "this work bring together these different aspects into a survey while pointing out the big opportunities that exist along each of the 5 is together with those existing at the system level .",
    "having briefly discussed the various facets of data driven energy efficient buildings , we now discuss an example scenario covering all of these aspects .",
    "we base our theme around the classic paper on pervasive computing  @xcite .",
    "john goes to bed at 11 pm in the night .",
    "he sets the alarm on his smartphone at 5 am when he intends to go for a jog .",
    "however , his health has not been at the best since the last few days affecting his sleep .",
    "he decides to inform his alarm clock that it should wake him up at 5 am if he is able to sleep by 11:30 , else wake him up after he has completed 6 hours of his sleep .",
    "john s smart surround sensors capture his sleep patterns and communicate to the alarm to ring at 6 am .",
    "his sleep disturbances , coughing are also captured , archived and emailed to john for sending to his doctor .",
    "john goes to the refrigerator to grab some cold water .",
    "the refrigerator understands that the person who has come to pick up water is john .",
    "john s heath system reminded his refrigerator that john has been advised to refrain from cold water .",
    "john gets ready and leaves home for office at 9 am .",
    "the security system , door and motion sensor register this movement .",
    "this information is communicated to john s thermostat which starts ramping down .",
    "his lights also turn off automatically sensing his absence .",
    "john has a meeting at 10 am and thus he would only go to his cabinet to keep his bag .",
    "based on the number of expected attendees , the thermostat in the meeting room starts ramping up , in order to achieve the desired temperature in time for the meeting .",
    "john s washing machine at his home is scheduled to run for 1 hour before john returns in the evening .",
    "his washing machine interacts with the grid and predicts the best time to run when the load on the grid is low is noon time when the electricity prices are low . around 3 pm",
    ", winds carry away the clouds and there is bright sunshine .",
    "john s solar system starts producing electricity .",
    "part of this dc produce is directly fed to dc appliances in john s home and the surplus is stored in a battery .",
    "john figured that he can save more money by locally consuming his generated solar energy as opposed to selling it to the grid . in the meanwhile , some of the artificial lights in john s office turn off in lieu of the sunlight available .",
    "john gets an email from the nilm system installed at his home about his disaggregated monthly consumption .",
    "the system recommends that the tungsten based lighting in his home is very inefficient and eating up 30% of his bill .",
    "if john would replace the same with more efficient led based lighting , his overall bill would go down by 15% .",
    "considering the cost of replacement , his roi period would be less than 6 months , after which he would be able to save 10 usd a month .",
    "we now analyse the above scenario and see how each small piece in this giant picture is a reality today .",
    "systems such as isleep  @xcite have explored using smartphones and motion sensors for sleep quantity and quality detection . in order to wake up john after he has completed 6 hours of sleep",
    ", his smartphone detects his sleep pattern .",
    "his smartphone contains an app which detects his cough patterns  @xcite and uploads the most critical data to his doctor .",
    "when john wakes up and goes to the refrigerator , systems for energy apportionment  @xcite ascertain that it is john and not someone else who is trying to draw cold water .",
    "the refrigerator is connected to john s smartphone over ip and informs him that cold water could be injurious to his health .",
    "several years of research in occupancy detection using variety of sensing modalities  @xcite are able to detect that john s home is unoccupied when john leaves for his office .",
    "smarter occupancy driven thermostats have been proposed in recent literature  @xcite which control and save energy based on occupancy prediction and external temperature , when john leaves for his office . by interconnecting soft sensors  @xcite such as office chat client and meeting software , the thermostat in john s personal cabinet does not ramp up since he has a meeting in the board room .",
    "conference room management sensor system  @xcite in the boardroom is alert to the number of occupants and drives the hvac accordingly .",
    "meanwhile in john s home his washing machine turns on at 1 pm .",
    "since this is an off - peak period , electricity is available at much cheaper rates at this time in comparison to the rest of the day .",
    "john scheduled his washing machine to run for one hour when the electricity would be cheap , which was enabled by demand response strategy  @xcite . due to availability of sunlight after 3 pm , dc appliances in john s home switch from the utility and consume raw dc power from the solar panel  @xcite .",
    "the lighting control system  @xcite in john s office also senses the bright sunshine and saves power while maintaining comfortable lighting levels inside the office .",
    "the smart meter installed at john s home is regularly collecting his electricity data and periodically sends john the disaggregated breakdown of power by appliances  @xcite .",
    "while many of these individual systems have been explored in the past in isolation and often in research settings , their application to the real world and their interconnection to complete the picture remains largely untested .",
    "the stepping stone to making such complex scenario a reality is the high resolution multimodal data collected from each of these subsystems , interconnected together , with algorithms that can do efficient operations while accounting for john s preferences .",
    " data is the new oil \" .",
    "data science has brought about a paradigm shift in the way problems are solved in myriad applications . from social networks to astronomy and subatomic physics , data has brought a new revolution enabling answering important questions .",
    "we now briefly discuss how data can play a pivotal role towards the development of energy efficient building .",
    "traditionally , building energy data was collected only for billing purposes .",
    "figure  [ fig : bill ] shows the electricity bills of residential apartments in london , uk and delhi , india .",
    "usually , data for such bills is collected once a month manually by the utility companies .",
    "the bill shown in figure  [ fig : delhi ] only provides the units of energy consumed during the billing period .",
    "commercial entities owing to their heavy consumption are often priced on a time of day based pricing .",
    "thus , in addition to the total units consumed , commercial entities are also provided with units consumed in peak and non - peak hours . in both of these cases ,",
    "the consumption information is coarse and provides limited actionable insights .    with the advent of the smart meter and",
    "some of the other sensors discussed in section  [ sec : introduction ] , more building energy data is now available than ever before .",
    "while the conventional process followed by utilities would generate a single reading per home per month , smart meters collecting data once every 15 minutes would be collecting 3000 times more data  @xcite .",
    "smart meters are often capable of collecting data at higher rates of once every minute which can amount to 240 tb of data collected from 5 million homes a month  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : big_data ] contrasts the volume of this smart meter data collected with other applications which have greatly benefited by the data deluge .",
    "the availability of such building energy data enables one to answer several important questions , some of which are presented below :    * consumers can be informed in real time about their consumption .",
    "this may be seen analogous to the cell phone alerts we get after every data transaction or call made .",
    "this may greatly help the end users to not only understand their usage but also act on it to conserve energy .",
    "* utilities earlier used to rely on receiving phone calls from aggrieved customers for detecting outages . however , with smart meter data readily available , utilities can leverage it for speedier outage detection and allocate resources efficiently to reduce downtime .",
    "* figure  [ fig : bill_tod ] shows the time of day energy consumption of a building in iiit delhi campus .",
    "when such detailed information is made available to the end users , they can take initiatives towards shifting their loads to normal or off - peak hours , when electricity is cheaper .",
    "such measures also benefit the utility as the peak demand is reduced . *",
    "figure  [ fig : historical_bill ] shows the trend in energy consumption from a home in new delhi  @xcite .",
    "this decreasing energy usage can be attributed to decreasing temperatures and hence decreasing use of air conditioners .",
    "developing an understanding into the correlations between weather and energy usage can allow better hvac control .",
    "such information is present in the uk bill ( figure  [ fig : london ] ) .",
    "however , without detailed analysis the same does not translate into actionable savings .            towards the realization of many of the above mentioned questions , building energy data requirements need to be categorized as per the application scenario .",
    "we firstly discuss the different temporal and spatial resolutions at which such data can be collected .",
    "* temporal resolution : * in accordance with the intended application , building energy data is collected at different temporal resolutions .",
    "energy audits are performed once every few years  @xcite and provide key insights into several aspects of buildings including energy efficiency and comfort levels .",
    "such audits are costly and require significant instrumentation . at a lower resolution of once a month",
    "utility companies collect total energy consumption .",
    "as discussed previously this provides limited insights to the end user .",
    "commercial entities often monitor their power factor daily as they are liable to be penalized if the power factor drops below a certain threshold .",
    "most of the above considered data collection is largely manual and sporadic .",
    "monitoring at higher resolutions of 1 hour or lesser requires automated mechanisms such as installation of smart meters . with the national smart meter roll outs across many countries as discussed in section  [ sec : introduction ] and initiatives such as greenbutton , collecting and accessing electricity data",
    "has become much easier for the end consumers .",
    "certain applications such as non - intrusive load monitoring ( nilm )  @xcite may require high frequency data with sampling rates of more than a thousand samples every second  @xcite .",
    "we summarize the temporal variations in building energy data collection in table  [ tab : temporal ] .",
    ".temporal variations in building energy data collection [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we specifically discuss in detail about the well studied problem of non - intrusive load monitoring ( nilm ) and discuss how it spans across the 5 is .          non - intrusive load monitoring ( nilm ) or energy disaggregation is the process of breaking down the energy measurement observed at a single point of sensing into constituent loads  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : nilm ] shows disaggregated consumption across a day for different appliances from the iawe  @xcite data set . in 2006 , darby et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that providing detailed electricity information feedback to end users can lead to 5 - 15% electricity usage reduction by behavioral change .",
    "recently , chakravarty et al .",
    "@xcite performed a study across more than 300 users in california and observed mean reduction of approx .",
    "15% when disaggregated information and real time electricity information is provided to end users .    with the advent of smart metering infrastructure ,",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : introduction ] , nilm has had a lot of renewed interest .",
    "a number of startups which provide itemized electrical usage to households over cloud based services have emerged recently .",
    "the recent interest has also led to the release of data sets meant to aid nilm research . of these redd  @xcite ,",
    "blued  @xcite , ampds  @xcite , uk - dale  @xcite , eco  @xcite , sust - data  @xcite , greend  @xcite , combed  @xcite , berds  @xcite and pecan  @xcite have been specifically released for nilm like applications .",
    "apart from these data sets , other data sets such as tracebase  @xcite , he s  @xcite , smart *  @xcite and iawe  @xcite can be used for several other building applications , including nilm .",
    "we now discuss the nilm problem across the five is .",
    "* instrument optimally : * nilm involves breaking down the aggregate meter data measured at a single point into constituent appliances or sub - meters lower in the electrical tree .",
    "thus , instrumentation for nilm involves measuring electrical parameters at both the aggregate and the sub - metered level ( desired for ground truth ) .",
    "the aggregate power readings are typically measured using smart meters . in special cases , when high frequency data ( more than 1 khz ) is required , sophisticated data acquisition systems ( daqs )",
    "sub - metered power data is typically measured either at the circuit level using current transformer ( ct ) based sensors or at appliance level using appliance sensors .",
    "* interconnect sub - systems : * while in the classic nilm problem , interconnection across different data streams is not studied , some studies use the extra information from other modalities to improve disaggregation .",
    "previous work  @xcite indicate the correlation between energy usage and external temperature .",
    "berges et al .",
    "@xcite correlate occupancy sensors with electrical data to identify potential savings in unoccupied rooms .",
    "similarly , other ambient sensors can also be interconnected with electrical sensors to obtain additional insights into the disaggregation problem  @xcite .",
    "* inferred decision making : * the vanilla use case of the nilm implementation provides an itemized breakdown of the electrical load .",
    "this inference problem can be viewed as an inverse classification problem .",
    "previous work has related this problem to source separation which is a well studied problem in sound processing .",
    "hart et al .",
    "@xcite , in their seminal work on nilm , proposed a simplistic combinatorial based and a simple edge detection based nilm algorithm .",
    "both these algorithms form the foundation behind many of the state - of - the - art algorithms .",
    "markovian analogues of combinatorial optimization formulation led to factorial hidden markov  @xcite among other hidden markov models .",
    "several nilm approaches have been proposed in the recent past  @xcite and a rich overview has been captured in several recent work as well  @xcite .",
    "it must be pointed that most of the prior research includes * supervised * methods in a * centralized * * offline * setup .",
    "* involve occupants : * as discussed earlier in this section , providing itemized feedback to end users has shown to reduce their end consumption .",
    "thus , the occupants can be involved by not only providing them with itemized billing , but also providing actionable suggestions on top .",
    "another interesting occupant involvement may arise from devising novel techniques for ground truth collection , which eliminates the need for appliance metering .",
    "* intelligent operations : * real time control actions to save electricity based on disaggregated information require complicated interactions with the control systems .",
    "current literature is thin on the aspect of automated control beyond the usual feedback that nilm systems provide .      in this section",
    "we briefly mention some of the challenges and opportunities in nilm research .    * * need for extensive deployment : * for certifying an algorithm on a previously unseen home , appliance level data must be collected from that home .",
    "* * computationally expensive approaches : * many approaches are computationally expensive and thus model only the high energy consuming appliances . owing to this , detailed information about low energy consuming appliances is often not made available .",
    "the computationally intractable approaches also limit the application in the real world setting . *",
    "* supervised methods require sub - metered data : * supervised nilm approaches train on the sub - metered data and create a model for each appliance .",
    "this requires ground truth instrumentation , motivating the need for development of novel unsupervised learning mechanisms .",
    "optimizing building energy usage remains an area of concern in light of dwindling natural resources . due to this concern , efforts are being concentrated to develop an understanding into buildings .",
