    "the existence of a multifractal measure for any system most often indicates an underlying process generating it , be it multiplicative or dynamic . in the context of chaotic attractors arising from dynamical systems , their multifractal measure result from a time ordered process , which may be an iterative scheme or a continuous flow @xcite .",
    "the description of the invariant measures in terms of @xmath1 @xcite or @xmath0 @xcite , however , provides only a characterisation of their geometric complexity .",
    "feigenbaum et.al @xcite and amritkar and gupte @xcite have shown that it is also possible to get the dynamical information in some specific cases by inverting the information contained in a multifractal measure using a thermodynamic formalism .    in this paper , we seek to get a characterisation of a chaotic attractor in terms of the underlying process that generates it .",
    "it appears that the process of generation of a multifractal chaotic attractor is similar to that of a typical cantor set ( where measure reduces after each step ) , with the _ dissipation _ in the system playing a major role .",
    "we show this specifically below using the example of cat map which is area preserving .",
    "but a key difference is that , for chaotic attractors , the nature of this reduction is governed by the dynamics of the system .",
    "this implies that if the @xmath1 and @xmath0 curves of a chaotic attractor are mapped onto that of a model multiplicative process , one can derive information about the underlying process that generates the strange attractor , provided the mapping is correct .",
    "here we try to implement this idea using an algorithmic scheme and show that this gives a set of parameters that can be used to characterise a given attractor .",
    "a similar idea to extract the underlying multiplicative process from a multifractal has been applied earlier by chhabra et.al @xcite . in order to make this inversion process successful",
    ", one needs to take into account two aspects , namely , the type of process @xcite ( whether l process , p process or lp process ) and the number of scales involved ( whether two scale or multi scale ) .",
    "chhabra et.al @xcite have shown that different multiplicative processes with only three independant parameters produce good fits to many of the observed @xmath1 curves .",
    "thus the extraction of underlying multiplicative process , based solely on the information of @xmath1 curve , is nonunique and additional thermodynamic information is needed for the inversion process .",
    "but the problem that we address here is slightly different . in our case ,",
    "the model multiplicative process is fixed as a general two scale cantor set which is the simplest nontrivial process giving rise to a multifractal measure .",
    "we then scan the whole set of parameters possible for this process ( which include the l process , p process and lp process ) and choose the statistically best fit @xmath1 curve to the @xmath1 spectrum computed for the attractor from the time series , which is then used to compute the final @xmath0 spectrum . in this way",
    ", the @xmath0 spectrum of a chaotic attractor gets mapped onto that of a general two scale cantor set .",
    "we show that the mapping can be done for a large number of standard chaotic attractors .",
    "the resulting parameters can be considered to be unique to the underlying process that generates the attractor , upto an ambiguity regarding the number of scales involved .",
    "the success of this procedure also implies that the @xmath1 and @xmath0 spectrum of a multiplicative process involving more than two scales also can be mapped onto that of a two scale cantor set .",
    "we prove this theoretically as well as numerically in sec.iv , by taking cantor sets with more than two scales .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that though the @xmath0 spectrum has contributions from all the scales involved in the generation of a multifractal , the information contained in an @xmath0 spectrum is limited only upto two scales .",
    "in other words , given an @xmath0 spectrum , one can retrieve only the equivalent two scales which are different from the actual scales .",
    "thus , while chhabra et.al @xcite argues that additional information is needed to extract the underlying multiplicative process , our result indicate that the @xmath0 formalism itself is unable to extract more than two scales .",
    "the motivation for using a cantor set to characterise the multifractal structure of a chaotic attractor comes from the fact that some well known chaotic attractors are believed to have underlying cantor set structure .",
    "for example , it has been shown @xcite that in the @xmath2 plane corresponding to @xmath3 of the lorenz attractor , a transverse cut gives a multi fractal with cantor set structure .",
    "even the chaotic attractor resulting from the experimental rayleigh - bernard convection holds a support whose transverse structure is a cantor set @xcite .",
    "these cantor sets are known to be characteristic of the underlying dynamics that generate the attractor .",
    "a more general arguement to support the above statement is by using the concept of kolmogorov entropy .",
    "kolmogorov entropy can be obtained by a successively fine partition of the attractor in a hierarchical fashion .",
    "going from one partition to the next gives one set of scales as shown in @xcite .",
    "these can be treated as scales of higher dimensional cantor sets .",
    "in general , there can be several scales .",
    "but the @xmath0 curve appears to be determined by only two scales .    in order to implement our idea ,",
    "the first step is to compute the @xmath1 spectrum of the chaotic attractor from its time series .",
    "this is done by the standard delay embedding technique @xcite , but by extending the nonsubjective scheme recently proposed by us @xcite for computing @xmath4 . the @xmath1 spectrum",
    "is then fitted by a smooth @xmath1 curve obtained by inverse legendre transformation equations @xcite of the @xmath0 curve for a general two scale cantor set .",
    "the statistically best fit curve is chosen by changing the parameters of the fit from which , the @xmath0 curve for the time series is evaluated along with a set of independant parameters characteristic of the cantor set .",
    "this procedure also gives a couple of other interesting results .",
    "for example , we are able to propose a generalisation of the standard equations of two scale cantor set for higher dimensions",
    ". moreover , we explicitely derive the equations for @xmath1 and @xmath0 spectrum of a three scale cantor set and show that they can be exactly mapped onto that of a two scale cantor set .    our paper is organised as follows :",
    "the details of our computational scheme are presented in sec.ii and it is tested using time series from the logistic map and different cantor sets with known parameters in sec.iii . in sec.iv , the @xmath0 spectrum of cantor sets with more than two scales",
    "is considered both theoretically and numerically .",
    "sec.v is concerned with the application of the scheme to standard chaotic attractors in higher dimensions .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec.vi .",
    "as the first step , the spectrum of generalised dimensions @xmath1 are computed from the time series using the delay embedding technique @xcite . for a given embedding dimension @xmath5 , the @xmath1 spectrum are given by the standard equation    @xmath6    where @xmath7 represents the generalised correlation sum .",
    "in practical considerations , @xmath1 is computed by taking the slope of @xmath8 versus @xmath9 over a scaling region . in our scheme , the scaling region",
    "is computed algorithmically @xcite for each @xmath1 using conditions for @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the spectrum of @xmath1 for @xmath12 in the range @xmath13 $ ] is evaluated with an error bar .",
    "assuming that the corresponding @xmath0 curve is a smooth convex function , we seek to represent it using the standard equations @xcite of @xmath14 and @xmath0 for the general two scale cantor set @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the rescaling parameters and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the probability measures with @xmath21 .",
    "thus there are three independent parameters which are characteristic of the multiplicative process generating a given @xmath0 curve . here",
    "@xmath22 is a variable in the range @xmath23 $ ] , with @xmath24 corresponding to one extreme of scaling and @xmath25 corresponding to the other extreme .",
    "taking @xmath26 , as @xmath24 , we get @xmath27 and as @xmath25 @xmath28 by inverting eqs .",
    "( [ e.2 ] ) and  ( [ e.3 ] ) and using the standard legendre transformation equations @xcite connecting @xmath14 and @xmath0 with @xmath12 and @xmath1 , we get @xmath29 @xmath30 changing the variable @xmath31 ,  ( [ e.2 ] ) and  ( [ e.3 ] ) reduce to @xmath32 @xmath33 differentiating  ( [ e.8 ] ) and  ( [ e.9 ] ) with respect to @xmath34 and combining @xmath35 using eq .",

    "( [ e.11 ] ) and  ( [ e.7 ] ) give both @xmath12 and @xmath1 as functions of the three independent parameters @xmath37 and @xmath19 .    for a given set of parameters ,",
    "the @xmath1 curve is determined by varying @xmath22 in the range @xmath23 $ ] and fitted with the computed @xmath1 values from the time series .",
    "the procedure is repeated by changing the values of @xmath19 in the range @xmath23 $ ] and for each @xmath19 , scanning the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the condition that both @xmath38 .",
    "a statistical @xmath39 fitting is undertaken and the best fit curve given by the @xmath39 minimum is chosen .",
    "the complete @xmath0 curve is derived from it along with the complete set of parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for a particular time series .",
    "in order to illustrate our scheme , we first apply it on standard multifractals where the @xmath0 curve and the associated parameters are known exactly . in all the examples discussed in this paper , @xmath42",
    "data points are used for the analysis .",
    "the first one is the time series from the logistic map at the period doubling accumulation point .",
    "the @xmath1 spectrum is first computed using eq .",
    "( [ e.1 ] ) ( with @xmath43 ) , for @xmath12 values in the range @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the computation is done taking a step width of @xmath45 .",
    "choosing @xmath46 and @xmath47 as input parameters , the @xmath1 curve is computed from the above set of equations and fitted with the @xmath1 values .",
    "the procedure is repeated by scanning @xmath19 in the range @xmath23 $ ] in steps of @xmath48 . for each @xmath19 , @xmath49 and @xmath41 ( which in turn determine @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are also varied independantly over a small range .",
    "the best fit @xmath1 curve is chosen as indicated by the @xmath39 minimum .",
    "since the error in @xmath1 generally bulges as @xmath50 , the error bar is also taken care of in the fitting process .",
    "the @xmath1 values computed from the time series and its best fit curve are shown in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] .",
    "the complete @xmath0 spectrum for the time series is computed from the best fit @xmath1 curve . to make a comparison ,",
    "the spectrum is also determined from eqs .",
    "( [ e.2 ] ) and  ( [ e.3 ] ) using the known values of @xmath51 and @xmath18 for the logistic map , namely , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is feigenbaum s universal number .",
    "both the curves are also shown in fig .",
    "the three parameters derived using our scheme are @xmath56 and @xmath57 which are reasonably accurate considering the finiteness of the data set .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]             we now check these results using the time series from a standard chaotic attractor , namely the rossler attractor for parameter values @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath42 data points . fig .",
    "[ f.8 ] shows the @xmath1 spectrum computed from the time series taking @xmath60 , along with the best fit curve applying our scheme .",
    "the fit is found to be very good for the whole range of @xmath12 values . the complete @xmath0 spectrum computed from the best fit @xmath1 curve",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the scheme also calculates the three parameters as @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 so that @xmath64 .",
    "thus one can say that if the @xmath0 spectrum of the rossler attractor is made equivalent to a two scale cantor set in three dimension , the resulting probability measures are @xmath65 and @xmath66 and rescaling parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "interestingly , it appears that the rossler attractor is generated by a p process rather than a lp process .",
    "the scheme has also been applied to several standard chaotic attractors in two and three dimensions .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum are shown in fig .",
    "[ f.10 ] for four of them , while the complete set of parameters for six standard chaotic attractors are given in table  [ t.2 ] .",
    "the error bars given for @xmath69 and @xmath70 are those reflected from the computed @xmath1 values . in a way , the two sets of parameters given above , that is @xmath71 and @xmath72 , can be considered as complementary to each other . while the former contain the finger prints of the underlying process that generate the strange attractor ( the extent of stretching and folding and redistribution of measures at each time step ) , the latter characterises the geometric complexity of the attractor once it is formed .",
    "both can be independantly used to differentiate between chaotic attractors formed from different systems or from the same system for different parameter values .",
    "the former may be more relevant in the case of chaotic attractors obtained from experimental systems .",
    "finally , we wish to point out that dissipation is a key factor leading to the multifractal nature of a chaotic attractor . to show this",
    ", we consider a counter example , namely , that of cat map which is area preserving .",
    "the fixed points of the cat map are _ hyperbolic _ , which are neither attractors nor repellers and the trajectories uniformly fill the phase space as time @xmath73 .",
    "its @xmath1 spectrum computed from the time series is found to be a straight line as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.11 ] , just like that of a white noise .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 curve is a @xmath74 function , also shown in fig .",
    "[ f.11 ] . since @xmath75",
    ", a two scale fit gives the parameters as @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus the cat map attractor turns out to be a simple fractal rather than a multifractal .",
    "in this paper , we show that a chaotic attractor can be characterised using a set of three independant parameters which are specific to the underlying process generating it .",
    "the method relies on a scheme that maps the @xmath0 spectrum of a chaotic attractor onto that of a general two scale cantor set .",
    "the scheme is first tested using one dimensional chaotic attractors and cantor sets whose @xmath0 curves and parameters are known and subsequently applied to higher dimensional cases .    in the scheme , the @xmath1 spectrum of a chaotic attractor is compared with the @xmath1 curve computed from a model multiplicative process . similar idea has also been used to deduce certain statistical characteristics of a system and infer features of the dynamical processes leading to the observed macroscopic parameters .",
    "one such example has been provided earlier by meneveau and sreenivasan @xcite in the study of energy dissipation rate in fully developed turbulent flows . by comparing the experimental @xmath1 data with that of a two scale cantor measure",
    ", they have shown that the dynamics leading to the observed multifractal distributions of the energy dissipation rate can be well approximated by a single multi step process involving unequal energy distribution in the ratio @xmath78 .",
    "usually , a multifractal is characterised only by the range of scaling involved @xmath79 $ ] , which roughly represents the inhomogeinity of the attractor .",
    "so the set of parameters computed here seems to give alternative way of characterising them .",
    "but we wish to emphasize that the information contained in these parameters is more subtle .",
    "for example , once these prameters are known , @xmath49 and @xmath41 can be determined using eqs .",
    "( [ e.27 ] ) and  ( [ e.28 ] ) .",
    "thus by evaluating @xmath19 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we get additional information regarding the dynamic process leading to the generation of the strange attractor .",
    "moreover , these parameters can also give indication as to _ why _ the degree of inhomogeinity varies between different chaotic attractors . as is well known from the srudy of cantor sets , the primary reason for the increased inhomogeinity is the wide difference between the rescaling measures @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "looking at the parameter values , rescaling measures @xmath80 and @xmath81 are very close for rossler and ueda attractors which appear less inhomogeneous , while that for lorenz and duffing are widely different making them more inhomogeneous with two clear scrolls .",
    "another novel aspect of the scheme worth commenting is the use of two scale cantor measures in higher dimension as analogues of chaotic attractors .",
    "eventhough such objects are not much discussed in the literature , one can envisage them , for example , as generalisation of the well known sierpinsky carpets in two dimension or the menger sponge in three dimension .",
    "but a key difference between these and a chaotic attractor is that the rescaled measures are not regular in the generation of the latter .",
    "recently , perfect et .",
    "al @xcite present a general theoretical framework for generating geometrical multifractal sierpinsky carpets using a generator with variable mass fractions determined by the truncated binomial probability distribution and to compute their generalised dimensions .",
    "it turns out that the chaotic attractors are more similar to multifractals generated in higher dimensional support , such as , fractal growth patterns and since the rescaled measures are irregular , a one dimensional measure such as @xmath82 need not have any physical significance .",
    "finally , for a complex chaotic attractor in general , the redistribution of the measures as it evolves in time can take place in more than two scales .",
    "thus it appears that a characterisation based on only two scales is rather approximate as we tend to lose some information regarding the other scales involved .",
    "but we have found that the @xmath1 and @xmath0 curves of a multi scale cantor set can be mapped onto that of an equivalent two scale cantor set .",
    "these two scales may be functions of the actual scales involved and may contain the missing information in an implicit way .",
    "thus , an important outcome of the present analysis is the realisation that the dynamical information that can be retrieved from the @xmath0 spectrum is limited to only two scales . in this sense",
    ", a two scale cantor measure can be considered as a good approximation to describe the multifractal properties of natural systems ."
