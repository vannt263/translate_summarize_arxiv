    "gravitational lensing effects are the only ways to directly measure the distribution of dark matter in the universe ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "2006 ) . because of their dependence on the formation of structures as well as on the geometry of the universe ,",
    "lensing effects are sensitive to the nature of dark energy , and therefore are highly promising in dark energy studies ( e.g. , knox et al .",
    "2006 ; munshi et al .",
    "weak gravitational lensing effects are mostly extracted from image distortions of background galaxies ( e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies therefore present themselves as important errors in lensing observations ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 1993 ; schneider 1996 ) .",
    "it has been commonly assumed that the intrinsic ellipticities of different background galaxies are statistically uncorrelated , and thus the average shear measured over a large enough number of galaxies gives an unbiased estimate on the lensing effects ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 1993 ) . however ,",
    "the formation of galaxies is highly affected by their environment , and the shapes of galaxies can well be correlated if they are close enough . with the assumption that the shapes of galaxies are well represented by the shapes of their host dark matter halos , numerical simulations indicate that the shape correlations range from @xmath26 to @xmath27 on angular scales of a few arcminutes depending on halos masses and redshift distributions of source galaxies ( e.g. , heavens et al . 2000 ; croft & metzler 2000 ; jing 2002 ; porciani et al .",
    "2002 ; heymans et al .",
    "the existence of such correlations can contaminate lensing signals significantly .",
    "weak lensing effects are directly related to lensing potentials , and thus only the gradient modes , i.e. , @xmath28-modes , are expected ( e.g. , crittenden et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath29-modes can therefore be used to reveal the existence of different systematics including the intrinsic alignments , but the correction to the @xmath28-mode amplitude can not be done in a straightforward way ( e.g. , heymans et al .",
    "down - weighting or removing physically closed pairs of background galaxies in lensing analyses reduces the contamination of intrinsic alignments at the expense of increasing shot noises if the alignments extend to relatively large scales ( e.g. , heymans et al .",
    "because of the different redshift - dependence for lensing signals and for intrinsic alignments , the tomographic method based on template fitting has been proposed to isolate different components assuming the availability of photometric redshifts for background galaxies ( king & schneider 2003 ) .",
    "this method has also been extended to include shear - ellipticity cross correlations in the analyses ( e.g. , hirata & seljak 2004 ; king 2006 ) .",
    "the intrinsic alignments of galaxies have been searched observationally .",
    "the supercosmos data on nearby galaxies ( with median redshift @xmath30 ) reveal a level of @xmath26 to @xmath31 on the correlation of intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies over the angular scales of a few tens of arcminutes ( brown et al .",
    "analyses on close pairs of galaxies from combo-17 data ( with @xmath32 ) find the intrinsic alignments to be consistent with zero but with uncertainties on the order of @xmath33 on scales of a few arcminutes ( heymans et al .",
    "investigations on sdss main sample with @xmath30 and its subsamples with @xmath34 to @xmath35 conclude that no significant intrinsic alignments are detected ( mandelbaum et al .",
    "the observational results on the intrinsic alignments are close to the lower limits given by different numerical simulations on dark matter halos ( e.g. , heymans et al .",
    "it has been pointed out that the existence of misalignment between baryonic matter and dark matter can significantly reduce the intrinsic alignment of background galaxies in comparison with that of dark matter halos and may explain the low observational results found in different surveys ( heymans et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this paper , we study the effects of the intrinsic alignment on finding mass concentrations through weak lensing effects . being the largest virialized objects in the universe , clusters of galaxies are important cosmological probes because their formation and evolution depend sensitively on cosmologies ( e.g. , borgani 2006 ; fan & chiueth 2001 ) . however , large uncertainties exist in linking cluster observables , such as galaxy richness , x - ray brightness and sunyaev - zeldovich effect , to their mass , the important quantity in cosmological analyses ( e.g. , bode et al .",
    "2006 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "lensing effects are generated through gravitation , and depend on the total mass distribution .",
    "thus it is expected that a cluster sample detected through weak lensing effects is better suited for cosmological studies in comparison with those selected by other probes ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "2002 ; hamana et al .",
    "2004 ; tang & fan 2005 ; fang & haiman 2006 ) . without involving complicated gas physics , weak lensing cluster detections , however , have their own shortcomings .",
    "besides observational errors , physical systematics , such as projection effects and complex mass distributions of clusters of galaxies , affect the selection function of weak lensing clusters considerably .",
    "thus weak lensing cluster samples are not truly mass - selected ( tang & fan 2005 ) .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies result false peaks in lensing maps and reduce the efficiency of cluster detections significantly ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "2002 ) . the false peaks could also be misinterpreted as dark clumps , which might lead to a faulty conclusion regarding the validity of a cosmological model . here",
    "we explore how the existence of the intrinsic alignment of background galaxies affects the number of false peaks in lensing convergence maps .",
    "we further propose that the number of false peaks can be used to constrain sensitively the level of the intrinsic alignment if one can separate true and false peaks observationally .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we discuss the correlations of galaxy ellipticities based on the model proposed by heymans et al .",
    "( 2004 ; heymans et al . 2006 ) . in  3",
    ", we study the dependence of the number of false peaks on the intrinsic alignment of background galaxies . in  4 , we analyze the constraints on the intrinsic alignment from the results of cfhtls deep on the number of false peaks given by gavazzi and soucail ( 2007 ) .",
    "discussions are presented in  5 .",
    "galaxies do not form in isolated ways .",
    "environmental effects play important roles in shaping galaxies",
    ". therefore correlations of ellipticities of galaxies are expected if they are close enough .",
    "the ellipticity of a galaxy is defined through the second moments of its surface brightness profile @xmath36 .",
    "specifically , we adopt the following definitions @xmath37 where ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 have similar forms ) @xmath40 here @xmath41 are the coordinates of the center of the galaxy image . concerning two - point correlations @xmath42 , it is convenient to choose @xmath43-axis and @xmath44-axis to be parallel and perpendicular to the line joining the two considered galaxies in the projected plane .",
    "numerical simulations show that @xmath45 ( e.g. , jing 2002 ; heymans et al .",
    "2004 ; heymans et al . 2006 ) . for @xmath46 ( @xmath47 )",
    ", we use the fitting formula provided by heymans et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which is @xmath48 our following analyses primarily concern @xmath49 , which can also be written as @xmath50 incorporating different galaxy models in numerical simulations , the fitting values of @xmath51 and @xmath29 are obtained for each model by heymans et al .",

    "( 2006 ) present their fitting results with @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ( see also heymans et al .",
    "2006 ) .    to investigate their influence on weak lensing effects , we need to analyze the angular correlation of intrinsic ellipticities , which is related to the three dimensional correlation @xmath54 through the following equation @xmath55c_{ij}(r_p,\\pi )   \\over \\int r_1 ^ 2\\phi(r_1)r_2 ^ 2\\phi(r_2)dr_1 dr_2[1+\\xi(r_{12})]},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the selection function and the two - point correlation function for background galaxies , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the comoving separations of two galaxies perpendicular and along the line of sight , respectively .",

    "observationally , the shear @xmath62 can be estimated from the ellipticities of galaxy images . in the weak lensing limit",
    ", we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 is defined in eq.(1 ) , and the superscripts o and s denote observed image and source , respectively .",
    "then the noisy convergence @xmath72 including the contamination from source ellipticities follows @xmath73 = \\tilde \\kappa(\\vec k)+c_{\\alpha}(k)[\\tilde e^{(s)}_{\\alpha}(\\vec k)].\\ ] ] considering smoothed quantities , we have ( e.g. , van waerbeke 2000 ) @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are the smoothed @xmath79 , @xmath62 and @xmath72 , respectively , @xmath80 is the smoothing function , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are , respectively , the surface number density and the number of source galaxies in the field .",
    "the noise part of @xmath83 due to the intrinsic ellipticities is then @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the fourier transformation of the smoothing function with the form @xmath86 following van waerbeke ( 2000 ) , the correlation of @xmath87 is calculated by averaging over both the ellipticities and the positions of source galaxies . without intrinsic alignments ,",
    "the correlation of @xmath87 arises only from the smoothing operations , and by ignoring the non - uniform sampling of source galaxies , we have ( van waerbeke 2000 ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the intrinsic dispersion of @xmath90 , and the factor @xmath91 comes in to be in accord with the definition of @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( 15 ) .    including the alignment ,",
    "the operation by averaging over the ellipticities of source galaxies , denoted by @xmath92 following van waerbeke ( 2000 ) , is @xmath93={\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\over 2 } \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}\\delta(\\vec \\theta_i-\\vec \\theta_j)+\\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}c_{\\alpha \\beta } ( \\vec \\theta_i-\\vec \\theta_j),\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is given in eq .

    "the corresponding median redshifts for the four distributions are @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .    in figure 2",
    ", we show the results of @xmath3 . for the intrinsic alignment ,",
    "we take @xmath125 , the value from sdss , in eq . ( 4 ) ( e.g. , heymans et al .",

    "we see that the result with @xmath130 and @xmath131 is an order of magnitude larger than that with @xmath132 and @xmath133 , demonstrating clearly the sensitive dependence of @xmath134 on the redshift distribution of background galaxies .",
    "therefore for tomographic analyses of weak lensing effects with source galaxies distributed in narrow redshift bins , the effects of intrinsic alignments can be significant .",
    "the angular dependence of @xmath3 is shallower than @xmath2 , and the ratio of @xmath9 increases with the increase of smoothing scales .    in table 1 , we list @xmath9 for various cases . with the upper limit @xmath135 from sdss",
    ", the ratio can reach as high as about @xmath136 for @xmath130 at @xmath137 .",
    "notice that @xmath2 and @xmath3 depend differently on the distribution of source galaxies . while @xmath3 depends mainly on the form of the redshift distribution , @xmath138 .",
    "thus for surveys with higher surface number density of source galaxies than what we consider here , the ratio @xmath9 can increase considerably .",
    "results expected for some surveys are presented in table 2 .",
    "the survey parameters for cosmos are taken from massey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . for snap",
    ", we adopt the parameters used in semboloni et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . for deep surveys with large @xmath81 , tomographic analyses with source galaxies distributed in narrow redshift",
    "ranges become possible .",
    "for example , with total @xmath139 as expected from surveys similar to snap , the background galaxies can be divided into three bins each with @xmath140 .",
    "the effect of intrinsic alignments can be significantly stronger within each bin than that in total . if we regard the narrow redshift distribution with @xmath130 as one of the bins , it is seen from table 1 that the respective values of @xmath9 for @xmath141 are about @xmath142 and @xmath143 with @xmath125 , in comparison with @xmath144 and @xmath142 expected for the full sample of galaxies from snap as seen in table 2 .    in next section ,",
    "we show that the number of false peaks in lensing @xmath0-maps is very sensitive to the ratio of @xmath9 .",
    "even a relatively low value of @xmath3 can result a considerable increase of the number of false peaks , and therefore reduce the efficiency of cluster detections significantly .",
    "weak lensing cluster detections associate high peaks in @xmath0-maps reconstructed from shear measurements with clusters of galaxies .",
    "intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies can produce false peaks , and therefore affect the efficiency of cluster detections .",
    "it is thus important to understand the statistics of false peaks thoroughly in order to extract reliable cluster samples from weak lensing surveys .",
    "van waerbeke ( 2000 ) studies the number of false peaks assuming no intrinsic alignments for source galaxies . in this case , the smoothed quantity @xmath87 defined in eq .",
    "( 14 ) is approximately a gaussian random field because of the central limit theorem . including the correlations of the intrinsic ellipticities",
    ", the statistics of the noise field @xmath87 can be complicated .",
    "relating the intrinsic ellipticities linearly with the tidal field predicts gaussian statistics . assuming that they are associated with galaxy spins gives rise to non - gaussian statistics for the intrinsic ellipticities . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath87 is related to the sum of the intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies in the smoothing window .",
    "since the intrinsic alignments are relatively weak ( on the order of @xmath145 to @xmath26 at @xmath146 ) , according to the central limit theorem we do not expect a highly non - gaussian field for @xmath87 if the number of galaxies within the smoothing window is large enough . in our following analyses",
    ", we assume the gaussianity for @xmath87 .",
    "detailed studies on its statistics will be carried out in our future investigations .",
    "for a two dimensional gaussian random field @xmath147 , the differential number density of peaks can be written explicitly in the following form ( bond & efstathiou 1987 ; van waerbeke 2000 ) @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the significance of a peak with @xmath147 being the value of the considered quantity at the peak position , @xmath150 , and @xmath151\\hbox { erfc}\\bigg ( -{{\\hat x}\\over b\\sqrt{1+b^2}}\\bigg ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is seen that @xmath152 is fully characterized by @xmath153 and @xmath154 , which are respectively defined as @xmath155 where @xmath156 considering the noise field @xmath157 defined in eq . ( 14 ) , with gaussian smoothings we have @xmath158 and @xmath159 in the case without intrinsic alignments ( van waerbeke 2000 ) .",
    "thus the average cumulative number density of peaks @xmath160 is independent of @xmath4 and scales with the smoothing angle as @xmath161 . in this case , given a survey area and a smoothing angle @xmath108 , the average number of false peaks in terms of the significance @xmath5 is fixed regardless of the specific value of @xmath4 .",
    "note that the existence of false peaks is the result of chance alignments of background galaxies .",
    "given @xmath162 for a false peak , its strength @xmath147 is proportional to @xmath4 which is in turn determined by @xmath81 and @xmath89 .",
    "thus the number of false peaks measured by their strength @xmath147 depends on @xmath81 and @xmath89 .",
    "smaller @xmath81 or larger @xmath89 gives rise to larger @xmath4 and leads to higher probabilities in forming false peaks with large @xmath147 by chance alignments .    including the intrinsic alignments , both @xmath163 and @xmath154 , and thus the number density of false peaks in terms of the true significance @xmath6 ,",
    "depend on the correlation level .",
    "it is noted from figure 2 that the level of intrinsic alignments from current observations is low comparing with @xmath4 .",
    "therefore @xmath163 , @xmath154 , and @xmath152 change only slightly with respect to the case without intrinsic alignments .",
    "the number of false peaks discussed above is given in terms of the true significance @xmath149 , i.e. , the peak height is measured relative to the full noise variance @xmath164 including @xmath134 .",
    "observationally however , it is difficult to obtain @xmath134 , and thus usually only @xmath4 is estimated and used in measuring the significance of a peak .",
    "the true significance of the peak corresponding to the observed significance @xmath162 is then @xmath8 . given a threshold on @xmath5 , the average number of peaks is @xmath165 . because @xmath166 for non - zero @xmath134 , @xmath167 increases with the increase of @xmath134 .    in figure 3 , we show @xmath168 , the number of false peaks resulting from intrinsic alignments , with respect to the detection threshold @xmath5 , where @xmath167 and @xmath169 are the cumulative numbers of false peaks in @xmath170 with and without intrinsic alignments . for comparison , we also plot @xmath169 ( thick lines ) in each panel .",
    "the left and right panels are respectively for @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",

    "it is seen that @xmath168 can be comparable to @xmath169 . for @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 at @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath14 , respectively .",

    "the efficiency measures how efficient we can find true clusters from lensing maps .",
    "assuming the nfw profile ( navarro , frenk and white 1996 ) for the mass distribution of clusters of galaxies , it is found that the number of peaks resulting from true clusters in lensing @xmath0-maps is about @xmath218 , and @xmath219 for significance larger than @xmath195 and @xmath181 , respectively , where @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath171 are used ( hamana et al . 2004 ) . as we show previously ,",

    "the lack of lensing detections in the medium bin and the low significance of the peak from hst observations raise questions on the lensing origin of the peak .",

    "focusing on the convergence @xmath0-maps , we analyze the number of false peaks due to the intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies taking into account their intrinsic alignments . under the assumption of gaussianity for the noise field ,",
    "the number of false peaks in @xmath0 maps depends on two characteristic parameters @xmath163 and @xmath331 , which are in turn determined by the two - point correlations of the field . without intrinsic alignments , @xmath158 and @xmath332 for a gaussian window .",

    "because @xmath336 drops steeply at large @xmath6 , the cumulative number of false peaks given a threshold on @xmath5 increases sensitively as @xmath134 increases .",
    "this can result a large reduction of the efficiency of weak lensing cluster detections .",
    "if a @xmath221 efficiency is expected in the case @xmath337 for a survey at a detection threshold @xmath180 , this number goes down to @xmath223 with @xmath338 .",
    "the increase of the number of false peaks with intrinsic alignments can also affect the statistical likelihood in judging whether a dark peak truly corresponds to a dark clump or is a false one from intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the number of false peaks can be a sensitive probe to the intrinsic alignments of background galaxies .",

    "the studies of cfhtls deep cluster survey find that @xmath14 out of @xmath15 peaks with @xmath263 in the area of @xmath13 are possibly false ones .",
    "we then obtain a constraint @xmath341 ( @xmath18 ) , which corresponds to the constraint on @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) with @xmath342 , fully consistent with the limit from sdss observations .",
    "future large surveys can generate samples containing many lensing detected candidates . if one can find @xmath343 false peaks , the quantity @xmath9 can be constrained to @xmath344 . with @xmath345 , we then have @xmath325 and @xmath346 .",
    "the intrinsic alignments of galaxies carry important information of galaxy formation , especially the environmental effects .",
    "previous observational studies show that the intrinsic alignments of galaxies are at the lower end of the theoretical predictions for dark matter halos , indicating the possible existence of misalignment between galaxies and their host halos ( e.g. , heymans et al .",
    "the method proposed in this paper allows us to constrain the intrinsic alignments of galaxies to a very high precision , and therefore is very promising in detailed studies on the formation of galaxies .    in our analysis",
    ", we assume a gaussian statistics for the noise in smoothed @xmath0 fields for both cases with or without intrinsic alignments .",
    "although we do not expect a highly non - gaussian smoothed noise field because of the central limit theorem , its detailed statistical properties deserve thorough investigations .",
    "the existence of intrinsic ellipticities as well as their alignments not only produces false peaks in @xmath0 maps , but also affects the height of the true peaks that are associated with clusters of galaxies . from previous discussions",
    ", we have @xmath347 for smoothed @xmath0 fields . assuming that @xmath348 and @xmath147 are independent of each other , we can write the distribution of @xmath83 in the form @xmath349dk_n$ ] .",

    "thus detailed analyses on the statistical properties of @xmath348 and @xmath147 are crucial in order to understand how the true peaks are influenced by the noise .",
    "further complications arise due to the shear - ellipticity correlations ( e.g. , hirata & seljak 2004 ; mandelbaum et al .",
    "2006 ) . because the ellipticities of galaxies are associated with the properties of their host halos , correlations between the ellipticities of foreground galaxies and the shears generated by their host halos on background galaxies are expected",
    ". then @xmath348 and @xmath147 are not independent quantities anymore .",
    "the effects of intrinsic alignments and shear - ellipticity correlations on lensing analyses depend differently on the redshift distribution of background galaxies .",

    "the effects are stronger for broader distributions . for tomographic lensing studies ,",
    "the intrinsic alignments are important for galaxies within the same redshift bins , while the shear - ellipticity correlations are significant in considering the cross correlations between different bins .",
    "extensive investigations on these problems and their effects on weak lensing cluster surveys will be pursued in our future research .",
    "weak lensing cluster studies together with other lensing analyses are sensitive probes of the dark matter distribution as well as the nature of dark energy ( e.g. , fang & haiman 2006 ) . with fast observational advances and thorough theoretical understandings of different systematics , cosmological applications of weak lensing effects",

    "<S> if one can observationally distinguish false peaks and peaks associated with real mass concentrations , e.g. , using lensing tomography and follow up observations , the number of false peaks can be used to constrain tightly the level of intrinsic alignments of source galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the cfhtls deep @xmath13 lensing observations and follow up studies find that @xmath14 out of the @xmath15 peaks with @xmath16 are likely to be false peaks , giving rise to a constraint @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) at the angular scale of @xmath19 for galaxies at redshift @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , the angular correlations of intrinsic ellipticities @xmath24 and @xmath25 of background galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this result is fully consistent with the limits on the intrinsic alignment derived directly from observations of sloan digtal sky servey . </S>"
