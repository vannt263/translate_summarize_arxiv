    "a main issue in glassy systems is the analogy between glass - forming liquids and discontinuous spin - glasses , first pointed out in the pioneering works by kirkpatrick , thirumalai and wolynes @xcite . in both cases",
    "the thermodynamical properties can be indeed related to the dynamical evolution in an energy landscape .",
    "in liquid theory one can define the notion of _ inherent structures _",
    "@xcite ( local minima of the potential energy , each one surronded by its attraction basin or valley ) and _ configurational entropy _ , i.e. the logarithm of the number of these minima divided by the number of particles in the system .",
    "then the low - temperature dynamical evolution can be described as a superposition of an intra - basin `` fast '' motion and a `` slow '' crossing of energy barriers .",
    "if the temperature of the system is small enough , namely less than the mode coupling critical temperature @xmath0 , the system gets trapped in one of the basins . since",
    "the number of energy minima diverges exponentially with the size of the system , a thermodynamic transition can be associated with an entropy crisis : the kauzmann temperature @xmath1 of the glassy transition corresponds to the vanishing of the configurational entropy .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an overview on equilibrium thermodynamics of glasses .",
    "consider now the class of discontinuous spin glasses , i.e. the mean - field models involving a random @xmath2-spin interaction .",
    "also these models show a dynamical transition at a temperature @xmath3 ( corresponding to @xmath0 ) where dynamical ergodicity breaks down ; a thermodynamic entropy - driven transition takes place at a lower temperature @xmath4 ( corresponding to @xmath5 ) , at which replica symmetry breaks down with a `` one step '' pattern . here",
    "the local minima of the free energy correspond to the solutions of the mean field tap equations .",
    "anyway at temperature @xmath6 metastable states with respect to any dynamics reduce to @xmath7-spin - flip stable states .",
    "the main gap in the analogy between structural glasses and discontinuous spin - glasses is that in the latter models , unlike the former , the couplings between spins are quenched random variables .",
    "a significant , recent step in filling this gap has been made by the introduction of the _ deterministic _ ,",
    "i.e. non - random , spin models which show a dynamical phase transition with a discontinuous order parameter and an equilibrium phase transition at a lower temperature associated with the vanishing of the high - temperature entropy .",
    "it is the high degree of frustation among the couplings , not the disorder , to generate a huge number of metastable states and thus the glassy behaviour .",
    "the discovery of these models proved that disorder is not necessary to reproduce a complex free energy landscape .",
    "metastables states in infinite - range disordered spin - glasses have been extensively studied , both in the sk model where the number of @xmath7-spin - flip stable states scales like @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the size of the system ( number of spins in the one - dimensional case ) , and in @xmath2-spin interaction spin - glasses @xcite .    here",
    "we deal with the same question in deterministic models . by probabilistic arguments",
    "we will obtain , for the models introduced in @xcite , a lower bound on the number of @xmath7-spin - flip stable states , which increases exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "hence this deterministic model exhibits the main feature of glassy behaviour .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the basic properties of the model we consider , the _ sine model _ of @xcite , a deterministic , one dimensional chain of @xmath9 spins with long - range oscillating interaction . in section 3",
    "we study the limiting distribution of the rescaled energy density , showing that it gets @xmath10-distributed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this property , which holds for the curie - weiss case , is an indication of the mean - field nature of the model . in section 4",
    "we deal with the state space of the system , computing explicitly ( for @xmath9 prime analytically , for other values of @xmath9 numerically ) the distribution of the energy levels by flipping one spin at a time ; among other things we show that there can be a large number of states with almost zero overlap with the ground state but very close in energy to it .",
    "finally , in section 5 we derive the main result of the paper , that is a lower exponential bound for the number of metastable states at temperature @xmath6",

    ". this model has been introduced by marinari , parisi and ritort as a deterministic system with high frustration ( competiting interactions with different signs and strengths ) able to reproduce the complex thermodynamical behaviour typical of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "it has been investigated analytically in the high - temperature regime , ( through an high - temperature expansion ) , and numerically also in the low - temperature phase ( using montecarlo annealing ) .",
    "the analytical study revealed the existence of a static phase transition at a temperature @xmath26 where the high - temperature entropy vanishes , while evidence of the existence of a higher temperature @xmath27 where the system undergoes a dynamical transition of second order ( i.e. with a jump in the specific heat ) with a discontinuous order parameter has been put forward by numerical analysis . it has also been shown , using the replica formalism , that most of the thermodynamical properties of this model are the same as those of a generic symmetric orthogonal matrix ( the static transition corresponding to rsb while the dynamical transition being given by the so - called `` marginality condition '' ) .",
    "the knowledge of the eigenvalues of @xmath28 imposes simple bounds on the energy of any spin configuration .",

    "here , due to orthogonality , the possible eigenvalues are @xmath30 so that - h ( ) .",

    "we point out that this property can be immediately proved for the curie - weiss model , thus indicating a mean field behaviour of the present model in the thermodynamic limit . to this end consider the partition function @xmath36 at inverse temperature @xmath37 : [ partitionfct ] z_n ( ) = _  _ n = 2^n_n ( e^-h ) , where @xmath38 denotes the expectation wrt @xmath18 , and note that the characteristic function of @xmath34 can be written as [ nrelazione ] _",
    "n(e^-h ) = e^-/2 z_n(/n)2^n .",
    "this expression will prove useful to compute the limiting expression of the characteristic function of the energy density @xmath34 without knowing the expression of all its moments . to see this ,",
    "we first decouple the spins as follows : let @xmath39 be an orthogonal matrix such that @xmath40 with @xmath41 . since @xmath42 we have @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 be such that @xmath47 .",
    "we have @xmath48 , and thus @xmath49 which , together with ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , ( [ partitionfct ] ) and ( [ nrelazione ] ) yields _ n(e^-h ) = e^-/2 det j^-12(2)^n/2_^n ( -12<y , j^-1y>+ _ i ) dy ( as usual , the square roots appearing in the above formulas are only apparently ill defined : they disappear in the expansion because it contains only the even terms ) .",
    "the above integral can be evaluated by means of standard high - temperature expansion techniques which turn out to be considerably simpler if one assumes that @xmath50 ( see @xcite ) . as we have already noted",
    ", this assumption amounts to fix at zero the mean value of the energy .",
    "also , the division by @xmath9 of the argument of the partition function leads to a convergence domain which is increasing as @xmath9 itself . in this way",
    ", the asymptotic expression ( for @xmath33 ) of @xmath51 can be written in the form _",
    "n(e^-h)=e^-/ 2 e^ng(/n ) ( 1+o ( n^-1 ) ) where the function @xmath52 is an effective specific free energy . for the orthogonal interaction matrix ( [ sine ] )",
    "one finds @xcite : g(x ) = 14 .",
    "it has the following expansion in the vicinity of @xmath53 : g(x ) = x^24 + o(x^3 ) , which , by the way , coincides with what one obtains for the sk model .",
    "this yields e^ng(/n ) = 1+^24 n+o ( ^3n^2 ) . summarizing",
    ", we have found that for any fixed @xmath54 , _",
    "n(e^-h)= e^-/2,n .",
    "using a well known theorem of probability theory @xcite which says that a distribution function @xmath55 converges weakly to @xmath56 if and only if @xmath57 for any @xmath54 ( where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the characteristic fcts of @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively ) and noting that @xmath60 is the characteristic function of the distribution fct @xmath61 , we then conclude that the distribution of @xmath34 tends to @xmath62 .",
    "as already noted in @xcite , for special values of @xmath9 the ground state , i.e. the configuration @xmath63 which minimizes the energy , can be explicitly constructed .",
    "indeed , for @xmath9 odd such that @xmath64 is prime of the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is an integer , let @xmath67 be the state given by the sequence of legendre symbols , i.e. ^0_x = ( ) = \\ {    ll + 1 , & , + -1 , & ,    . with @xmath68 .",
    "then ( see the appendix ) : [ gs ] h(^0)=-n2a typical ground state for @xmath2 prime of the form @xmath65 reflects the well known random distribution of the legendre symbols ( see fig .",
    "[ ground1 ] , where a pair of ground states are shown for two different @xmath9 values ) .",
    "no structure is present at any scale . nevertheless , denoting by @xmath69 the _ specific magnetization _ of the ground state , i.e. m^0=_x=1^n^0_x = _ x=1^n ( )",
    ", one observes that it tends to be a positive function of @xmath9 , fluctuating around the value @xmath70 . to let the reader better",

    "[ ground1 ]        [ magn1 ]    for the remaining part of the paper we will restrict to @xmath72 prime , with @xmath73 .",
    "we point out that this set has measure zero as a subset of the natural numbers .",
    "however , we have strong numerical evidence that some relevant properties that we are going to discuss hereafter , such as the behaviour of @xmath74 , the statistics of energy levels and the number of metastable states ( see below ) are somehow generic in @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath75 be the subspace consisting of the @xmath76 configurations obtained by starting from the ground state @xmath67 described above and flipping exactly @xmath77 different spins .",
    "each point of @xmath78 can thus be identified with a @xmath77-dimensional vector @xmath79 of the form @xmath80 , with @xmath81 for @xmath82 , which specifies the positions of the flipped spins along the chain of length @xmath9 .",
    "we then define the ` flipping ' map @xmath83 as : ( l_)_x = \\ {    ll-_x , & x , + _ x , & x .    .",
    "in this way we can write _",
    "s = \\{l_^0}_. the correspondence @xmath84 given by @xmath85 is plainly one - to - one .",
    "therefore in the sequel we shall freely identify a state @xmath85 with the vector @xmath86 .",
    "alternatively , we can proceed as follows .",

    "it is now possible to study the distribution of the energy levels on the individual subspaces @xmath78 , where @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 be the probability distribution restricted on @xmath78 , i.e. [ ps ] p_s(c)=n s^-1 _ c _ s 1 , and let @xmath95 denote the expectation wrt @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath97-th moment of the energy @xmath98 on the subspace @xmath78 is given by _",
    "_ _ sh^n ( ) dp_s ( ) = n s^-1 _ _ sh^n(l_^0 ) , so that the @xmath97-th moment @xmath99 of the energy on the whole configuration space @xmath100 is _ n(h^n)__nh^n ( ) d_n()=12^n_s=0^nn s_s ( h^n ) . a tedious but straightforward calculation ( see appendix ) yields the following expressions for the first two @xmath77-moments : [ moment1 ] _ s ( h)= -n2(1 - 2sn)^2 , [ moment2 ] _",
    "s^2(h ) _ s ( h^2 ) - ( _ s ( h))^2 = and consequently _ n ( h ) = -12,_n ( h^2 ) - ( _ n ( h))^2= n-12 .",
    "these results indicate that , at variance with the ferromagnetic case where the energy is constant on each subspace @xmath78 , here there is a significant overlap between the distributions ( for different @xmath77 values ) of the energy when restricted to @xmath78 . in particular , from the espression of @xmath101 we see that there can be a large number of states having small overlap with the ground state but nevertheless with energy very close to @xmath102 .",
    "for example we have @xmath103 , indicating that the energy restricted to the subspace @xmath104 may fluctuate over the whole energy range .",

    "to understand the discrepacy between the estimated exponent and the one measured numerically one should note that the nature of the interaction makes the conditional probabilities play a major role in the asymptotics of the number of metastable states . to be more precise , our approximation which assumes mutually independent individual @xmath204-stability events , i.e. @xmath205 , is actually reasonable only for small value of @xmath206 ( this can be checked , for example , calculating the correlation functions ) .",
    "as numerical results shows , for large values of @xmath206 the specific form of the interactions make these events strongly dependent . in fig . [ conditional ]",
    "we show the function @xmath207 providing the average of @xmath208 over a large sample of different permutations @xmath209 of the lattice points .",
    "the conditional probabilities @xmath207 grow monotonically , almost linearly , from the initial ( unconditioned ) value up to a number close to @xmath7 . in other words , requiring that a large number @xmath206 of spins produce an @xmath204-stable state increases substantially the probability of doing the same for the remaining spins .",
    "0.2 cm    [ conditional ]    another way of understanding the constructive effect of the correlations is the following .",
    "consider again the function @xmath152 .",
    "having fixed @xmath173 , we have already noticed that for @xmath77 and @xmath9 large enough the values of @xmath210 with @xmath211 are approximately distributed according to a gaussian probability density with mean @xmath212 and variance @xmath213 , regardless of the particular value of @xmath173 .",
    "thus , in particular , the same distribution are expected to arise if one considers the values of @xmath210 constrained to the subsets of configurations such that @xmath214 , or @xmath215 . on the other hand , if one picks @xmath216 with @xmath217 , @xmath175 , and computes numerically the two conditional distributions of the values of @xmath210 given @xmath218-stability , ... ,",
    "@xmath170-stablity ( again with the constraints @xmath214 or @xmath215 ) , one finds that their means move to opposite directions , thus increasing the probability of @xmath173-stability ( see ( [ totalprob ] ) ) .",

    "the two central distributions correspond to the unconditioned cases , namely the values of @xmath153 for @xmath221 with the only constraints @xmath148 or @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "considering instead the values taken by @xmath34 on the states @xmath86 which , besides the constraints specified above , are stable with respect the first @xmath222 spins , one finds two distributions whose mean values have moved towards opposite directions .",
    "an averaged over @xmath137 has been performed .",
    "we have investigated the statistical properties of energy levels and metastables states for a class of deterministic models , the most representative being the _ sine _",
    "model@xcite , which have attracted much attention in recent years for their glassy behaviour despite the non - random nature of the interaction .",
    "we have pushed further on the analogy with glassy systems , proving a number of properties typical of disordered spin models . in particular , using number theoretic methods , we have described the energy ( equivalently , free energy at @xmath223 ) landscape as a function of configurations with a fixed overlap with the ground state .",
    "the analysis revealed the existence of states very different from the ground state but with energy arbitrarily close to it : this corresponds to the `` chaoticity '' property of spin - glasses systems , well established in long range models .",
    "more importantly , some of these states can be local energy minima ( equivalently , @xmath7-flip stable at @xmath223 ) .",
    "they are expected to have a significant weight on the partition function in the low - temperature region , giving rise to the non - equibrium behaviour observed in annealing montecarlo experiments .",
    "we have been able to estimate the approximate number of these energy minima .",
    "the analytic computations , combined with the numerical findings , strongly support the conclusion that the bound ( [ nestimate ] ) estimates from below the number of metastable states @xmath140 , proving their exponential increase with the size of the system .",
    "a number of basic questions about metastability arises now in a natural way , such as computing the energy density distributions of metastables states , studying energy barriers among them and their attraction basins .",
    "stability of configurations with respect to the flip of an arbitrary number of spins is an interesting question as well .",
