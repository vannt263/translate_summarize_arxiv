    "the photoresist was exposed to uv light ( 365 nm ) on a tabletop mask aligner ( oai model 100 ) through a photomask ( microtronics inc . , fine line imaging ) .",
    "the samples then were heated using uv light to cure the polymer .",
    "finally , the microdisks were released from the wafer via sonication .",
    "+ microdisks make only weak interface distortions on planar interfaces .",
    "thus , when placed on planar interfaces , these particles fail to interact unless they are within @xmath6 radii of contact .",
    "we confirm that the disks have pinned contact lines by imaging the underside of a particle trapped in an interface ( fig .",
    "the image is acquired using a gel - trapping technique by placing a microparticle in the air - aqueous interface of a warm ( @xmath7 ) gellan solution which is then cooled to form a gel .",

    "+        to study particle migration , a host interface is formed with a well - defined curvature field using a technique reported previously @xcite which we recapitulate briefly here .",
    "a curved oil - water interface is formed around a micropost of height @xmath9 and radius @xmath10 centered within a confining ring located several capillary lengths from the micropost .",
    "this structure is filled with water so that the contact line pins at the top of the micropost and the slope of the interface is @xmath11 , as measured using a goniometer ( see fig .",
    "the shape of the oil - water interface for distances from the micropost small compared to the capillary length obeys @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radial distance measured from the micropost center .",
    "this interface ( shown schematically , fig .",
    "3(b ) ) has zero mean curvature @xmath14 , and deviatoric curvature @xmath15 which is finite and position dependent .",
    "the deviatoric curvature is greatest in magnitude close to the post , and decrease monotonically with distance from the post .",
    "+    disks are submerged in the oil phase , and allowed to sediment and attach to the interface .",
    "particles , once attached , migrate up the curvature gradient along radial trajectories toward the micropost if they are isolated ( fig .  4(a ) ) .",
    "deviations from radial trajectories occur only for particles close to neighboring particles ( within @xmath16 radii ) or close to disks that are already anchored on the micropost ( fig .",
    "trajectories of isolated particles superpose when graphed in terms of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes time to contact defined as @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the time when the disk reaches the edge of the post ( fig .",
    "the more complex trajectories owing to interaction with neighboring elements or floating aggregates are evident as deviations from the master @xmath13 vs. @xmath18 curve ( see fig .",
    "+ since the particle migrates in creeping flow , the capillary force on the particle is balanced by a drag force according to @xmath21 where we adopt for @xmath22 lamb s drag coefficient for a disk on an interface @xcite and the average viscosity of the two surrounding fluids @xmath23 , is used .",
    "the capillary energy @xmath24 is balanced by viscous dissipation , which is found by integrating the velocity of migration over the particle position for each particle trajectory . in fig .",
    "5 capillary energies extracted from these trajectories for isolated disks are plotted against @xmath25 . in this figure",
    "we report only regions of the trajectory far enough from the micropost to neglect hydrodynamic interactions @xcite .",
    "the capillary energy plotted against @xmath25 is linear ; the root mean squared error of the linear fit is approximately is @xmath26 for each trajectory .",
    "this migration is in agreement with a simple functional form which we have derived previously for migration of cylindrical microparticles migrating in curvature fields @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the amplitude of a quadrupolar distortion made by the particles . in our prior work on cylindrical microparticles ,",
    "quadrupolar distortions were bounded by the equilibrium wetting configuration around the particles and thus could be associated with the particle shape . for the present case , we hypothesize that quadrupolar distortions are excited in the fluid interface owing to uncontrolled roughness of the particle , as suggested by stamou _",
    "_ in their analysis of particles at planar interfaces @xcite . the data in fig",
    ".  5 are consistent with particles with quadrupolar modes of @xmath29 , a magnitude similar to the roughness of the particles , suggesting that particle roughness sets the scale for disturbances sourced by the particle into the interface .",
    "the curvature capillary energy associated with this weak distortion is appreciable ; @xmath30 , explaining the non - brownian , deterministic paths observed for the disks .",
    "+ in the experiments , the curvature of the host interface decreases monotonically with distance from the center of the micropost . for very small curvature , the capillary force driving upward migration is too small to overcome the downward pull of gravity , as reported by blanc _",
    "_ ; if a particle attaches to an interface far away from the micropost the particle should not migrate @xcite .",
    "we predict this threshold in our experiments by equating the gravitational force on the particle to the upward capillary force , @xmath31 and find that particles should fail to migrate for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this compares well to our experimental observation @xmath34 .",
    "+        confronted by the observed linear dependence of the curvature capillary energy on @xmath25 , we derive the capillary energy in detail .",

    "below , we show that , while , in principle , such a term might occur , its pre - factors is identically zero .",
    "to do so , we present a detailed discussion of capillary energy for weakly non - circular pinned contact lines on curved interfaces .",
