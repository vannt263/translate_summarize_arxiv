    "the extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( eis ) instrument on hinode @xcite covers the two wavelength bands 170211 and 246292    that are dominated by coronal emission lines mainly from the iron ions .",
    "the majority of strong transition region lines in the solar spectrum are found at longer uv wavelengths , and all of the transition region lines found in the eis bands are weak in normal conditions .",
    "@xcite however identified two types of active region features that were found from soho / cds observations to yield significantly enhanced transition region emission lines : coronal loop footpoints and active region blinkers .",
    "he suggested that in such events the weak eis lines would become significant , and so yield useful science . an eis observation from 2007 january 20",

    "this study uses the 2  slit to raster over an area of 100@xmath9216  with 30 second exposure times , giving a total duration of 26  minutes .",
    "the 2  slit was used to both increase the counts for weak lines , and allow a larger spatial area to be covered more rapidly ; the disadvantages are a degradation of the spatial ( in the x - direction ) and spectral resolution over the 1  slit . due to on board data storage restrictions , only a fraction of the total eis wavelength range",
    "could be downloaded , and so 20 wavelength windows were chosen to observe the transition region lines as well as a number of coronal lines .",
