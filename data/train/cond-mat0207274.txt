    "it is always amusing to recognize that the concepts of equilibrium statistical physics , and hence of thermodynamics , can be applied in ( at first sight ) unexpected branches of physics .",
    "for example , it has long been known that several features of multiparticle production in high - energy hadronic collisions are well described by thermostatistical models @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that a simple thermal description of particle abundances works quite well for the hadrons produced in elementary electron - positron collisions @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the hadronic system reaches statistical equilibrium , at least for some observables .",
    "one might try to justify this in terms of the large number of degrees of freedom in the final state .",
    "thermostatistics is also an important issue in relativistic heavy ion physics .",
    "the main focus of recent investigations in this field is the production and identification of the quark - gluon plasma , a phase of nuclear matter consisting of unconfined quarks and gluons .",
    "thermostatistical aspects play a central role in these investigations , as it is expect that some form of statistical equilibrium is attained in high - energy collisions of two heavy nuclei , at least in the central region @xcite .",
    "one of the signatures of `` thermal '' multiparticle production is the exponential form of the transverse energy distribution of the produced hadrons .",
    "we are tempted to interpret the slope parameter of this distribution in terms of a temperature of the final state .",
    "in fact , up to the isr energy region , the transverse energy distribution is consistent with such an interpretation .",
    "the same happens to the observed hadron abundances",
    ".    however , at higher energies , the thermal interpretation of the transverse energy spectra should be modified .",
    "the sps experiments revealed a significant deviation from the exponential transverse energy distribution , together with the violation of several scaling laws .",
    "usually , these aspects are understood in terms of the onset of hard qcd processes such as the formation of mini - jets .",
    "furthermore , even if local thermal equilibrium is attained , dynamical effects such as collective flow may entangle with the thermal transverse spectra .",
    "consequently , for these energies , a pure statistical description to the overall system can not be applied .",
    "recently , it was pointed out @xcite that the nonexponential behavior of the transverse energy distribution in high - energy multiparticle production processes ( including electron - positron annihilation ) can be described rather well by the nonextensive thermostatistics of tsallis @xcite .",
    "in addition to the excellent quality of the fit to transverse energy spectra , an interesting point of the extended statistical approach to multiparticle production is that the `` temperature '' stays almost constant , independent of the incident energy , conveniently recovering the classical hagedorn scenario @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility of reviving the statistical description of the complex dynamics of hadronic collisions in a unified way , including the onset of semi - hard qcd processes , provided that we generalize the concept of statistical equilibrium . differently from the standard statistical mechanics of boltzmann and gibbs ,",
    "the tsallis nonextensive thermostatistics contains one extra parameter , the `` entropic index '' @xmath1 , originated in the definition of the entropy . the physical origin of this parameter",
    "is not yet completely understood and a lot of discussions are in course .",
    "it can be attributed to various factors , like the dynamical suppression of certain domain of the phase space ( multifractal structure near the critical point ) , the presence of long range forces , or fluctuations in a small system @xcite . for an entropic index @xmath2 tsallis statistics",
    "reduces to the boltzmann - gibbs theory . if @xmath0 , rare events are enhanced relative to the boltzmann - gibbs case . if @xmath3 , frequent events are privileged .",
    "so far , all phenomenological applications of tsallis statistics to high - energy collisions have found @xmath0 in these processes .",
    "some discussion on the possible origin of nonextensive behavior in hadronic systems can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the transverse energy distribution is not the only probe of the formation of a locally thermalized source of particles in high - energy collisions .",
    "another important observable is the multiplicity distribution of the produced hadrons .",
    "the negative binomial distribution @xcite @xmath4 is often used to express hadron abundances in high - energy processes , where @xmath5 is the number of particles and @xmath6 the average multiplicity .",
    "the @xmath7 parameter is related to the variance @xmath8 of the distribution by @xmath9 although the negative binomial distribution is known to arise from some specific processes , such as bose - einstein particles with different sources @xcite , its use in high - energy multiparticle production is rather phenomenological .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss how the generalized statistical mechanics of tsallis ( with @xmath0 ) affects the multiplicity distribution in hadronic collisions .",
    "we show that for @xmath1 close to unity the distribution of particle numbers in a high - energy gas is approximately negative binomial .",
    "the boltzmann - gibbs and tsallis statistics are applied to a simple meson gas model , and the results are compared to experimental data .",
    "first , let us review briefly tsallis statistics and derive some formulas necessary for our discussion .",

    "the @xmath1-average also reduces to the usual one .",
    "the equilibrium probabilities @xmath11 are determined by maximizing the entropy under appropriate constraints .",
    "these are the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) , and the fixed ( average ) value of the energy @xmath18 and of any other relevant conserved quantity .",
    "we assume for simplicity that there is only one such quantity , a conserved charge @xmath19 .",

    "this point has been investigated recently @xcite , and it was shown that the quantity @xmath42 sometimes called the `` physical '' temperature , can provide a better characterization of thermal equilibrium .    instead of using the chemical potential @xmath29 to control the average charge @xmath19 , as in the grand canonical approach outlined above",
