    "a large number of studies of planet - hosting stars ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * etc ) have been carried out over recent decades with the aim of increasing our understanding of the processes involved in the formation of planets .",
    "the earliest studies of the metallicity of planet - hosting stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as subsequent ones ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) indicated that most of these stars are rich in metals .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the excess metallicity observed .",
    "the first is the infall of metal - rich ( planetary ) material into the stellar envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the second is related to the prestellar enrichment of interstellar matter ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . the issue has not yet been finally resolved ; however , the second assumption is to be preferred , as the infall of matter can not provide an appreciable increase in the metal abundance .",
    "the high metallicity of planet - hosting stars is well - established for stars with massive planets ( jupiter - like ones ) @xcite , while it is not for stars with less massive planets , namely those with planets the size of neptune or earth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that terrestrial planets have no special requirement for enhanced metallicity for their formation , and they support the hypothesis that stars hosting terrestrial planets have a metallicity similar to stars with no known transiting planets @xcite . @xcite and @xcite drew attention to the possibility of planet formation for metallicities lower than solar .",
    "it was shown that there is an excess of @xmath5-elements , especially magnesium , in the stars with low - mass planets , which is more pronounced in the thick - disc population than in the thin disc for metallicities below 0.3 dex @xcite .",
    "this implies that metals other than iron may noticeably contribute to planetary formation if the iron abundance is low .",
    "lithium plays a unique role in the study of planet - hosting stars .",
    "its abundance is apparently lower in the stars with planetary systems than in those without @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite found that there is some evidence that lithium depletion in planet - hosting solar - type stars is higher when their planets are more massive than jupiter .",
    "hot stars that host jupiter - like planets and have effective temperature  in the range of 5900 - 6300 k show lithium abundances that are 0.14 dex lower than those in stars without detected planets @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that lithium depletion is usually associated with stellar evolution @xcite , a phenomenon that is confirmed by the dependence of lithium abundances on age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the lithium abundances of solar twin stars are a function of stellar age , while there is no indication of any relationship between planet - hosting stars and enhanced lithium depletion .    in order to identify either the presence or the absence of a possible relation between chemical abundances and mechanisms of planetary formation",
    ", various studies have been performed to examine the chemical peculiarities of planet - hosting stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the main properties of planets and their hosts ( e.g. mass ) @xcite , their position in the galaxy @xcite , and galactic evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "studies of the chemical composition of the sun , solar twins and solar analogues that have highly accurate abundance determinations ( @xmath0 0.01 dex ) , @xcite shown a decrease in the relative content of refractory elements in the sun , namely one that is by 20@xmath6 lower than those of solar - analogue stars and solar twins with giant planets . because a correlation between the abundance differences and condensation temperature @xmath1 was found , these authors speculated that the decrease in the relative content was associated with the presence of earth - like planets . in the literature , there are several alternative explanations for the abundance trends with @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite found that chemical peculiarities ( i.e. small refractory - to - volatile ratio ) of planet - hosting stars are likely to reflect their older age and inner galactic origin ; hence , stellar age and , probably , galactic origin are the key factors to establish the abundances of some specific elements . it has also been suggested that the @xmath1 trend correlates strongly with stellar radius and mass @xcite .",
    "the trend may also depend on stellar environment @xcite , and internal processes , such as gas - dust segregation in the protostellar disc @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the @xmath1 trend may depend strongly on the spectra of the stars used .",
    "in particular , these authors observed significant differences in the abundances of the same star as derived from different high - quality spectra .",
    "previously , @xcite had suggested that the detectability of neptune - class planets may increase in stars with a low metallicity .",
    "@xcite also confirmed the presence of chemical abundance differences between stars with and without exoplanets , as well as the relationship between chemical abundances and planetary mass .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of stellar mass on the derived planetary mass and noted that the stellar mass estimates for giant stars should be employed with extreme caution when computing planetary masses .",
    "binary systems of stellar twins are important objects in this investigation , as the effects of stellar age ( chemical evolution ) or birthplace in the galaxy are similar for both components of the binary pair .",
    "@xcite showed that there are clear correlations between [ el / fe ] ratios and stellar ages in solar twins .",
    "@xcite found that both components in the binary system wasp 94 a and b are planet - hosting stars , and they differ in their chemical composition .",
    "the binary system hd 80606/hd80607 exhibits no remarkable differences in the abundances of its components , despite the fact that the star hd 80606 hosts a giant planet @xcite .",
    "however , abundance variations were found in the xo-2 planet - hosting binary from independent observations @xcite . as reported by @xcite",
    "the abundance ratios [ el / fe ] show signatures of both chemical evolution and planets .",
    "our group has investigated nearly 600 stars , dwarfs and giants over several years .",
    "we determined their atmospheric parameters and chemical composition in order to study the chemical and dynamical evolution of the galaxy and , primarily , the chemical enrichment of various galactic substructures @xcite .",
    "we detected 14 planet - hosting stars among the target ones .",
    "it would be interesting to examine the behaviour of the abundances of various elements , including lithium , refractory and volatile elements , as well as neutron - capture elements for the stars with and without planets that are present in our data base .",
    "such a study could enable an independent analysis of the correlation between the presence of planets and the chemical composition of stars , possibly shedding some light on the existing contradictions , as well as re - examining earlier determined constraints on the mechanisms of formation of planets and planetary systems .",
