    "a recent challenge in research on active matter systems has been understanding the basic principles of various self - organizations observed in the collections of self - propelled or self - driven elements  @xcite .",
    "representative examples include schools of fish , flocks of birds , swarms of animal , and crowds of humans . in these systems , all elements exhibit macroscopic and synchronized collective behavior in the same direction despite microscopic repulsive interactions . the self - driven force can lead to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the locomotion , which is significantly different from passive brownian motion .",
    "lane formation is a remarkable example of self - organization in many autonomous agent systems , and is associated with pedestrian counterflows  @xcite .",
    "specifically , when two groups of agents are driven and move in opposite directions , the agents of the same species tend to move collectively and eventually form a lane in the driven direction .",
    "such segregation of the different lanes is closely related to how efficiently the pedestrians can flow toward the desired direction in various crowded environments , such as evacuation in the event of a disaster  @xcite .    the social force model was proposed to obtain the underlying mechanism of a pedestrian flow from the microscopic level  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "each pedestrian is modeled as a particle with a finite excluded volume that interacts via repulsion to avoid collisions .",
    "additionally , the self - driven force acts on each particle in order to adjust the instantaneous velocity to the preassigned desired direction and magnitude . a large number of simulation studies have been carried out to optimize realistic pedestrian behavior  @xcite .",
    "a similar lane - formation phenomenon has also been demonstrated in simulations of binary oppositely charged particles  @xcite as well as experiments  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the lane formation has been examined for various combinations of the external force and the density under the periodic boundary condition  @xcite or with confined geometry  @xcite .",
    "the finite size effect has also been investigated  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the critical force that generates lane formation exhibits a logarithmic increase , which implies that global phase segregation can not occur in a finite amount of time  @xcite .",
    "recently , the observed system size dependence has been interpreted through an analogy with the driven lattice gas model  @xcite .",
    "that is , the lane formation in the driven system is basically governed by the phase separation . however , global lane formation extending to the system size from the disordered and random configuration would occur with infinite time .    with regard to the oppositely self - driven particles ,",
    "recent advances have been seen in simulations for the phase diagram of lane formation with square system geometry under the periodic boundary condition has been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the anisotropic friction perpendicular to the driven direction has been introduced , which mimics the anisotropic response of pedestrians after collisions . however , the information regarding the density and finite size effects is still limited , in contrast to the data obtained in the above simulation studies on driven systems under an external field .    in this study",
    ", we examined the lane formation dynamics of oppositely self - driven binary particles by simulating langevin molecular dynamics of a two - dimensional system .",
    "in particular , we systematically examined the effects of the density and the finite size on lane formation .",
    "various order parameters regarding the lane structure were quantified : the degree of lane formation , velocity fluctuation , transport efficiency , characteristic time scale of lane formation , lane number , lane width , and lane thickness .",
    "such comprehensive quantitative analysis allowed us to clarify both the similarity and differences between self - driven and externally - driven lane formations .",

    "half of the particles has @xmath1 , and the other half has @xmath3 .",
    "this variable @xmath4 characterizes the driven direction ( along the @xmath5-axis ) when a self - driven force is applied to the particle , which is explained below .",
    "the number density is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the linear dimension of the system .",
    "the periodic boundary condition is used in both the @xmath5- and @xmath8-directions .",

    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the magnitude of the potential energy and particle diameter , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 stands for the zero mean random force acting on the @xmath11-th particle .",
    "the variance of @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , which is characterized by the thermal energy @xmath23 and friction coefficient @xmath24 that should be associated with the collisions with the solvent .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the two cartesian components .",
    "the self - driven force acting on particle @xmath11 is given by @xmath27 here , the first term denotes helbing s proposed social force model related to pedestrian phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 component of the @xmath11-th particle velocity tends to attain the desired velocity @xmath28 in the driven @xmath5-direction , which is determined by the variable @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding pclet number @xmath30 is then described by @xmath31 .",
    "this model includes the relaxation time due to the friction @xmath32 in the @xmath5-direction . for the @xmath8-direction",
    ", on the other hand , the @xmath8-component of the velocity decays to zero because of the friction @xmath33 perpendicular to the driven direction . here",
    ", the friction coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 are chosen independently to imitate the anisotropic effect of the momentum exchange with the substrate  @xcite .",
    "the drift velocity of the single particle in the stationary state is described by @xmath34 .",
    "if the random force @xmath21 and associated friction force @xmath35 are not taken into account , our model equation reduces to that used in the previous study  @xcite . in addition , if the frictions @xmath32 and @xmath33 become zero , the considered equation of motion reduces to the usual langevin equation of the many - particle system .",
    "hereafter , the units of length , temperature , and time are represented as @xmath20 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively . in all simulations , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 were fixed values , and a time step of @xmath41 was used . in this study ,",
    "the dependence of the number density @xmath42 on the lane formation for various @xmath28 and @xmath33 was first intensively investigated at the fixed particle number @xmath43 .",
    "the examined densities were @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "next , we focused on the finite size effect on lane formation by changing the particle number as @xmath43 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 at the fixed number density @xmath58 .",
    "after equilibration with the thermal energy @xmath59 using the langevin equation , the self - driven force @xmath60 was applied to the particles . measurements in this paper were averaged over ten independent simulation runs .",
    "to characterize the degree of lane formation , some order parameters were proposed for evaluating the number of particles of the same species along the driven direction . as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simulation system can be virtually divided into identical rectangular strips along the driven @xmath5-direction .",
    "the number of strips is given by @xmath61 + 1 $ ] , where @xmath62 $ ] denotes the gauss symbol .",
    "thus , the width of each strip along the @xmath8-direction is described by @xmath63 , which is closer to the particle diameter @xmath20 .",
    "the order parameter for the lane formation in the @xmath64-th rectangular strip is defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 represents the number of @xmath67 species particles in the @xmath64-th rectangular strip .",
    "this signed variable @xmath68 is determined by the difference in numbers between the positively and negatively driven particles @xmath69 , which is normalized by the total particle number @xmath70 in the @xmath64-th strip .",
    "thus , the range of @xmath68 is from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , and @xmath68 becomes positive if the @xmath1 particles becomes dominant in the strip and negative if the @xmath3 particles becomes dominant .",
    "the order parameter @xmath73 for the total system is then defined by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the ensemble and time average .",
    "the order parameter @xmath73 begins with zero at the initial state and finally reaches 1 when the system exhibits the lane formation in the steady state .",
    "the former corresponds to the randomly mixed state , whereas the latter corresponds to the lane formation structure by the particles of the same species along the driven direction .",
    "the transport property is depicted by the driven efficiency in the @xmath5-direction , _ i.e. _ , the average drift velocity normalized by the single particle @xmath76 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the average magnitude of the particle velocity in each driven direction .",
    "the velocity fluctuation in the @xmath5-direction is calculated from @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the velocity variance in each driven direction .    the number of lanes @xmath81 was also evaluated . for this",
    ", the order parameter of each strip @xmath68 was first discretized with respect to the threshold values @xmath82 to @xmath83 @xmath84 , @xmath85 @xmath86 , and @xmath71 @xmath87 .",

    "in addition , the periodic boundary condition @xmath93 was utilized . because the number of lanes @xmath81 is equal to that of the interface between the oppositely driven lanes , the following equation can be obtained : @xmath94 the average thickness of the interface @xmath95 is estimated by @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "correspondingly , the average lane width along the @xmath8-direction @xmath98 can be evaluated from the following relation : @xmath99 thus , the average length scale per lane @xmath100 can be evaluated from the combination of the lane width @xmath98 and interface thickness @xmath95 .",

    "first , we show the results of various observables in the system with @xmath43 . in particular , the density dependence is systematically discussed in this subsection .",

    "these figures indicate that both large @xmath28 and @xmath33 led to lane formation . with increasing @xmath28 ,",
    "the collision between oppositely driven particles was enhanced .",
    "in addition , increasing @xmath33 reduced the mobility in the @xmath8-direction perpendicular to the driven direction .",
    "these two effects resulted in a bundle of particles in the same direction and generated the interface between oppositely driven particles , as seen in the snapshots of fig .",
    "[ fig_op_lane ] .",
    "this was the main mechanism for the lane formation , which is in accord with the previous study using newtonian dynamics  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_efficiency ] plots a contour map of the transport efficiency @xmath102 .",
    "this indicates that the overall behaviors of @xmath73 and @xmath102 were well correlated .",
    "namely , higher lane formation provided more efficient transportation .    both figs .",
    "[ fig_op_lane ] and [ fig_efficiency ] demonstrate that the region of the lane formation states became smaller as the density increased .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the mean free path of the particle decreased with increasing the density .",
    "accordingly , a position exchange after a collision between oppositely driven particles is unlikely to occur in such dense states .",
    "in addition , the transition line between non - lane and lane states showed non - monotonic and reentrant features , particularly at higher densities .",
    "that is , the lane state reentered the no - lane state when @xmath28 was greatly increased at a fixed @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_op_lane](i)-(iii ) ) . to visualize the details of the reentrance ,",
    "the corresponding velocity fluctuation in the driven @xmath5-direction @xmath104 was analyzed , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_velocity_variance ] .",
    "the no - lane states with larger @xmath28 exhibited markedly larger velocity fluctuations at all densities .",
    "figure  [ fig_op_lane ] shows a typical snapshot at @xmath58 as state ( iii ) .",
    "the interface between opposite lanes became unstable , and the same species tended to aggregate to form a cluster .",
    "finally , the lane structure became a clustered structure , where collisions of oppositely driven clusters frequently occurred .",
    "note that the observed reentrance is not equivalent to similar phenomena observed in the lane formation of externally driven particles  @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the reentrant behavior between the no - lane and lane structures demonstrated dependency on the density at some fixed external force . specifically , lane formation was unlikely because the thermal fluctuation became dominant at low densities even with a large external force .",
    "in contrast , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig_op_lane ] and [ fig_efficiency ] , the transition line of the present self - driven system monotonically changed as a function of the density .",
    "this was due to the anisotropic friction @xmath33 , which reduced the fluctuation of the mobility in the @xmath8-direction even at low densities .         with the particle number @xmath43 ( red ) , @xmath55 ( blue ) , and @xmath57 ( green ) .",

    "the snapshots of stales ( iv)-(vi ) in fig .  [ fig_op_lane ] show that the number of lanes @xmath81 apparently depended on the density @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ fig_lane_number_108 ] presents a scatter plot of @xmath81 with various @xmath28 and @xmath33 as a function of the density @xmath42 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath81 gradually decreased with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "as mentioned above , lane formation is caused by the collision between oppositely driven particles . at high densities , where the mean free path becomes smaller , the collisions of oppositely driven particles are correlated to one another ; then , the aftereffects are plausibly widespread to some extent to make a wider bundle of same - species particles .",
    "this leads to a smaller number of lanes at higher densities .",
    "the range of @xmath81 was observed to become progressively wider when the density decreased .",
    "the snapshots of states ( vii)-(ix ) ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_op_lane ] show the strong dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath28 with a fixed @xmath108 at the density @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , the fluctuation of the mobility in the @xmath8-direction became smaller with a larger @xmath33 .",
    "this resulted in a larger @xmath81 because the collisions were less correlated than those at higher densities .",
    "in contrast , both larger @xmath28 and smaller @xmath33 reduced @xmath81 even at low densities , for which the mechanism was similar to that at higher densities .",
    "an analogous density dependence of the lane number has previously been reported for the external - field driven systems  @xcite . in this study , however , the particle number was controlled to change the density in the fixed simulation area .",
    "this means that the system size effect has not been adequately investigated in a systematic manner . in order to overcome this issue",

    "this implies that the macroscopic lane formation occurs at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a comparable system size dependence has been reported for the lane formation caused by the external field  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , analogous scaling has been demonstrated in the coarsening dynamics of the driven lattice - gas model  @xcite .",
