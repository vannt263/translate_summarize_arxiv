    "in two dimensional space , quantum particle , can exhibit a continuous range of statistics interpolating between bosons and fermions @xcite .",
    "such exotic particles are called anyons and they are believed to play a role in the fractional quantum hall effect and , perhaps , even in high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "wilczek @xcite showed that , each anyon is taken to be a boson carrying a unit statistical magnetic flux , @xmath3 , concentrated at its location .",
    "when one anyon circles once around another in an anti - clockwise sense ; the wavefunction picks up a aharanov - bohm phase : @xmath4 \\equiv \\exp ( 2i\\theta ) .$ ] the cases @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to the particles being bosons , semions and fermions respectively @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we can take the anyons to be fermions carrying a statistical flux 2@xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath8 and @xmath6 correspond to fermions , semions and bosons .",
    "the purpose of this note is to present that electron itself may be considered as an anyon .",
    "namely it carries a charge and a magnetic flux associated with its spin .",
    "we calculate the magnetic flux associated with the electron s spin using by a semi - classical model which is based on the magnetic top model @xcite that can be made equivalent to a circular motion of a point charge in two dimensions .",
    "we show that the magnetic flux associated with electron spin is @xmath9 for spin down electron and -@xmath9 for spin up one .",
    "generally the lagrangian of a non - relativistic electron with mass m and electric charge ( -e ) moving in a uniform magnetic field in z direction ( @xmath10 ) is given by    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the position vector in 2d ( two dimensions ) , @xmath13 is the velocity vector and @xmath14 is the vector potantial ( @xmath15 ) . in the symmetric gauge",
    ", the vector potantial can be written as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the unit vectors along the x and y axis respectively .    to calculate the flux in terms of the radius and the magnetic field ;",
    "we write :    @xmath19    if the electron is rotating in x - y plane in the counter clockwise direction with the angular frequency @xmath20 .",
    "the position vector is    @xmath21    taking the time derivative of eq.(4 ) we get the velocity vector :    @xmath22    substitution of eqs.(4),(5 ) and @xmath23 in eq.(3 ) we get    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the cyclotron angular frequency .",
    "we note that the time integral in eq.(6 ) has to be taken over one cyclic period @xmath26 .",
    "this is the crucial point of our calculation .    by using eqs.(6 ) and",
    "( 2 ) the vector potantial , @xmath14  in the symmetric gauge can be related to the magnetic flux @xmath3 by    @xmath27    the canonical momentum @xmath28 can be derived from the lagrangian given in eq.(1 ) :    @xmath29    because of the  rotationally invariance of the lagrangian the canonical angular momentum , j@xmath30 is constant :    @xmath31    where j is the gauge invariant kinetic angular momentum .",
    "this conserved canonical angular momentum j@xmath30 has a conventional spectrum @xcite : its eigenvalues are always integers in units of @xmath32 . the difference between j@xmath30 and j is due to presence of the magnetic flux , and hence the magnetic field b. both in the absence and in the presence of the magnetic field b , the canonical angular momentum is always represented by the quantum mechanical operator :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the polar angle on x - y plane .",
    "the eigenvalues of j@xmath30 is m@xmath32 ( m@xmath35 ) when it acts on single valued wavefunctions with angular dependence @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the kinetic angular momentum operator can be written as    @xmath37    which when acting on single - valued wavefunctions with angular dependence @xmath38 becomes :    @xmath39    which states that the spectrum of j consists of integers shifted by @xmath40 and is non - zero even for m=0 .",
    "we believe that this non - zero contributions to the kinetic angular momentum comes from spinning motion of the electron .",
    "in the following part we calculate the magnetic flux associated with the electron s spin using by a semi - classical model which is based on the magnetic top model @xcite that can be made equivalent to a circular current loop .",
    "our calculations gives that magnetic flux associated with electron spin is @xmath9 for a spin down electron and -@xmath9 for spin up one .",
    "as clearly stated by barut et al @xcite the magnetic top is an adequate model of quantum spin , because the magnetic moment performs a simple precession around the magnetic field although the top itself performs a complicated motion .",
    "it was also shown that by canonical and schrdinger quantization , pauli theory of spin was obtained . in the magnetic top model the electron",
    "is assumed to be  a small sphere with the radius r@xmath41 and the spin of the electron is assumed to be produced by the electron s rotation about itself with an angular frequency @xmath42 .",
    "our model @xcite is based on the magnetic top model which can be made equivalent to a circular current loop with the radius r in x - y plane .",
    "it will be shown that as far as the flux is concerned the radius r of this loop is a phenomenal concept and it gets eliminated in the end . in this model",
    "the electron motion is considered in two parts namely an ",
    "motion which can be interpreted as the motion of the center of mass ( and hence the central of charge ) and an  internal  one whose average disappears in the calssical limit .",
    "the latter is caused by the spin of the electron .",
    "the important thing is that although the average of the internal motion disappears the average of the flux associated with the internal motion does not . in accordance with the magnetic top model ,",
    "we assume that the spin angular momentum of the electron is produced by the fictitious point charge ( -e ) rotating in a circular orbit with radius r and with the same angular frequency @xmath42 .",
    "it can be shown that the present calculations can be generalized to any kind of spherical charge distribution for electron .",
    "the details of the charge distribution determines the relation between the radius r@xmath41 of the electron and the radius r of the current loop .",
    "further it is important to note that electron s spinning frequency @xmath42 is very high compared to the cyclotron frequency @xmath43 ( for b=5x10@xmath44 gauss , @xmath45 ) . as was shown in eq.(6 ) for calculation of the magnetic flux",
    "the cyclotron period @xmath46 is the important time interval . during the cyclotron period @xmath47",
    ", electron completes only one turn around its cyclotron orbit , but it spins ( @xmath48 ) times about itself .",
    "although the radius of the electron ( and hence the radius of the loop ) is very small , because of  the rapid spinning , the total flux during the cyclotron period , @xmath49 will be comperable with the flux quantum , @xmath50 .",
    "we will see that the total flux associated with the spin is exactly @xmath51 where ( + ) sign stands for spin down electron and ( - ) sign for spin up one .    in the above described model",
    "we define the vector going from origin to the fictitious point charge ( -e ) as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the vector going from origin to the centre of mass of the electron and @xmath54 is the vector going from the centre of mass to this fictitious point charge ( -e ) rotating in a circular orbit with a radius @xmath54 and an angular frequency @xmath42 .",
    "so the vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 for spin up and down electrons read :    @xmath57    @xmath58    from eqs.(4 ) and ( 14 ) the vector @xmath59 for spin up electron reads ,    @xmath60\\stackrel{\\wedge } { i } \\\\ & & + [ r\\sin \\omega _ { c}t - r\\sin \\omega _ { s}t]\\stackrel{\\wedge } { j }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the time derivation of eq.(16 ) gives    @xmath61\\stackrel{\\wedge } { i } \\\\ & & + [ r\\omega _ { c}\\cos \\omega _ { c}t - r\\omega _ { s}\\cos \\omega _ { s}t]\\stackrel{% \\wedge } { j }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    analogously to eq.(3 ) the total flux @xmath62 for spin up electron is    @xmath63=\\frac{\\stackrel{% \\rightarrow } { b}}{2}.\\oint\\limits_{0}^{t_{c}}\\stackrel{\\rightarrow } { % r^{\\prime } } ( \\uparrow ) \\times \\frac{\\stackrel{\\rightarrow } { dr^{\\prime } } } { dt% } dt\\ ] ]    substitution of eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) into eq.(18 ) gives :    @xmath64    where we used the identity : @xmath65 here the cross terms contain the product of different angular frequencies and phases , so the integral of these terms vanishes and eq.(19 ) reduces to    @xmath66    with a similar procedure the flux for spin down electron becomes    @xmath67    in eqs.(20 ) and ( 21 ) the first terms are the fluxes without the electron spin [ eq.(6 ) ] . while the second terms are the spin contributions .",
    "now we want to calculate the second terms in terms of the flux quantum @xmath68 : the spin magnetic moment @xmath69 of a free electron is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the spin angular momentum of the electron .",
    "when we introduce the magnetic field @xmath72 the z component of the magnetic moment becomes :    @xmath73    where we put g=2 for a free electron .",
    "as we stated earlier we assume that the spin angular momentum of the electron is produced by the fictitious point charge ( -e ) rotating in a circular orbit with the angular frequency @xmath42 and the radius r in x - y plane . in this case",
    "the z - component of this magnetic moment for spin down electron will be    @xmath74    where we put i=@xmath75 and a=@xmath76    if we compare eqs.(23 ) and ( 24 ) we find    @xmath77    which relates the spinning angular frequency @xmath42 to the radius r.    substitution of eq.(25 ) and @xmath20 in the second terms of eqs.(20 ) and ( 21 ) we find    @xmath78    eq.(26 ) states that the flux associated with the electron spin is independent of the radius of circular loop ( @xmath79 the radius of the electron ) and the mass of  the electron .",
    "the ( + ) sign stands for spin down electron and ( - ) sign for spin up one .",
    "next we want to calculate the first terms  of eq.(20 ) and ( 21 ) in terms of the flux quantum .",
    "to do so we look at the schrdinger equation for an electron in the presence of the uniform magnetic field @xmath80 .",
    "let the center of the electron s orbit be the center of a cylindirical coordinate system @xmath81 in which the z - axis is directed along the magnetic field @xmath82 . if we take the vector potantial described in eq.(2 ) namely@xmath83 , ie .",
    "@xmath84 ,  @xmath85 then the schrdinger equation in this gauge becomes :    @xmath86 -\\frac{ie\\hbar b}{2mc}\\frac{\\partial \\psi } { % \\partial \\phi } + \\frac{e^{2}b^{2}\\rho ^{2}}{8mc^{2}}\\psi = e\\psi\\ ] ]    because of the cylindirical symmetry all terms containing @xmath87 vanish and since the electron is assumed to be moving in x - y plane @xmath88 .",
    "so eq.(27 ) is reduced to a simpler equation of polar coordinates :    @xmath89 + \\frac{\\hbar ^{2}r^{2}}{% 8m\\lambda ^{4}}\\psi = e\\psi\\ ] ]    where    @xmath90    the solutions of eq.(28 ) has the form :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the n@xmath93 hermite polynomial .",
    "the eigenvalues corresponding to eq.(30 ) are    @xmath94    which are the well - known landau levels .",
    "the probability density p(r ) in polar coordinates is given by :    @xmath95    which has its maxima at    @xmath96    from eq.(33 ) the magnetic flux corresponding to these orbitals will be :    @xmath97    if we compare eqs.(31 ) and ( 34 ) we find that without spin , magnetic energy and the flux are proportional to each other :    @xmath98    it is tempting to think that this proportionality is valid even in the presence of spin ( ie . in the presence of zeeman term in the energy ) .",
    "so in the presence of spin the additional zeeman term ( @xmath99 ) in the energy should produce an additional flux term @xmath100 which is exactly what we derived in eq.(26 ) .",
    "another test of our model is that the definition of the spin of an anyon : generally the spin of an anyon is defined @xcite by    @xmath101    if we substitute the value of @xmath3 from eq.(26 ) , we find :    @xmath102    which is exactly equal to the electron spin .",
    "so far we have considered only the flux associated with the external magnetic field .",
    "however even in the absence of the external field , because of its spin , electron will create and carry a magnetic flux with itself . in accordance with the magnetic top model",
    ", we can assume that the spin angular momentum of the electron is produced by the fictitious point charge ( -e ) rotating in a circular orbit with radius r and angular frequency @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "if we take the spin vector in z direction then the magnetic field lines associated with the spin magnetic moment , @xmath104 will be as in fig.1a .    outside the current loop the magnetic vector potantial @xmath105 of the spin magnetic moment @xmath106",
    "is given by    @xmath107    the magnetic field @xmath108 of the electron is calculated through the relation :    @xmath109    in the x - y plane the x and y components of @xmath82 vanish and the z component takes the form    @xmath110    where @xmath111    we want to calculate the fluxes through the x - y plane outside and inside the current loop with radius r : the related fluxes will be defined as follows :    @xmath112 ( r)= the total flux through x - y plane outside the loop ( r @xmath113 r )    @xmath114(r ) = the total flux through x - y plane inside the loop ( r @xmath115 r )    the condition of no magnetic monopoles ( @xmath116 ) requires that the number of magnetic field lines inside the loop must be equal to the number of magnetic field lines outside the loop .",
    "therefore    @xmath117    @xmath118 can be calculated easily from eq.(40 ) :    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is used to be consistent with the previous area vectors.from eq.(41 ) @xmath114(r ) will be    @xmath121    in the present current loop model it can be shown that inside the loop the z - component of the magnetic field is the same at every point and is equal to the magnetic field at the center , ie . for @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath123    where we used @xmath124 and @xmath125 this can be proved just by calculating the flux of uniform field @xmath126 through the loop : @xmath127    substitution of eq.(14 ) and its derivative in eq.(45 ) gives    @xmath128    where we used eq.(44 ) and put @xmath129 therefore as far as the magnetic flux is concerned the field lines inside the loop can be replaced by the field lines of the uniform magnetic field @xmath130 .",
    "so in the equvalent picture of @xmath131 we have a uniform magnetic @xmath132 and a fictitious point charge ( -e ) rotating in the clockwise sense as in fig.1b .    from eq.(45 )",
    "we can state that the flux @xmath131 is the one that corresponds to spinning period @xmath129 on the other hand the uniform magnetic field @xmath132 inside the loop defines another period @xmath49 which is the cyclotron period :    @xmath133    we have seen that for flux quantization the cyclotron period @xmath49 of the magnetic field is the important time interval .",
    "therefore the total flux corresponding to @xmath49 is    @xmath134    substitution of eq.(25 ) and ( 47 ) gives    @xmath135    with a similar prosedure the flux associated with the spin down electron will be    @xmath136    therefore even in the absence of the external magnetic field the flux associated with electron spin will be @xmath0 .",
    "we have calculated the magnetic flux associated with the electron spin to show that electron itself can be treated as an anyon .",
    "our model is based on the magnetic top model which can be made equivalent to a circular current loop with radius r. as far as the flux is concerned the radius r of this loop is a phenomenal concept and is eliminated in the end .",
    "we distinguish the spin angular frequency , @xmath42 from the cyclotron angular frequency @xmath137 it is shown that the calculation of the flux is led to a time integral .",
    "the crucial point is that , the limits of time is taken from zero to cyclotron period , @xmath47 . during the cyclotron period @xmath49 , electron completes one turn around the cyclotron orbit , but it spins ( @xmath138 ) times about itself .",
    "although the radius of the electron is very small , because of the rapid spinning , the total flux associated with the electron spin is comparable with the flux quantum .",
    "as far as the flux is concerned the mass of the electron is a parameter which is eliminated in the end .",
    "therefore whether we take the relativistic mass or not the result does not change ( to go from eq.(22 ) to ( 26 ) we do not put any restriction on the electronic mass ) .",
    "namely the flux is @xmath139 .",
    "it can be shown that the present calculations can be generalize to any spherical charge distribution for electron .",
    "the details of the charge distribution determines the relation between the radius of the electron r@xmath140 and the radius r of the equivalent current loop . for a uniform charge distribution the magnetic moment of the spinning electron",
    "is found to be @xmath141 if we compare this with eq.(24 ) , the relation between r and r@xmath41 becomes : @xmath142 we believe that the present study will bring a new insight to understand the area of physics which concerns the magnetic flux .",
