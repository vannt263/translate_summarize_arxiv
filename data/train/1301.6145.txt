    "metric theories of gravity are based on the universal coupling of gravity to matter and energy , formalized in the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) .",
    "this principle states that gravitational acceleration is independent of composition ( the weak equivalence principle ) and that nongravitational measurements should be independent of the velocity of the freely - falling reference frame ( local lorentz invariance ) and of the location in spacetime ( local position invariance ; lpi ) where they are carried out .",
    "most efforts to unify general relativity , the widely accepted metric theory of gravity , with quantum field theory involve a breakdown of eep  @xcite .    according to conventional parametrizations ,",
    "the principle of lpi is the least - well tested tenet of eep  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , tests of lpi can be used to constrain the coupling of certain fundamental constants to gravitational potential and more generally to test for spatial dependence of the constants .",
    "a spatial dependence is allowed under a particular scenario in string theory  @xcite , and there have been published claims of a measured spatial variation of the fine structure constant from astronomical observations  @xcite .",
    "the traditional redshift for a clock with frequency @xmath5 depends only on the change in gravitational potential @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and should be independent of the clock composition , for example .",
    "violation of lpi may manifest itself in an anomalous gravitational redshift of an atomic clock , commonly parameterized with a clock - dependent term @xmath0 : @xmath8 measurements of gravitational redshift vs @xmath6 provide a test of the redshift formula and of lpi  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the relative redshift of two clocks of different composition can be used ; if the two clocks have lpi - violating parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the relative frequencies should vary with gravitational potential as @xmath11 this differential measurement can be made with a higher precision than a direct measurement of redshift vs @xmath6 at the possible expense of a reduction in the size of the effect if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are close in value .",
    "the gain in precision reported here compared to direct redshift measurements is about 200 , indicating that the two redshift anomalies must be the same to @xmath12 for the best lpi test by absolute measurement of the gravitational redshift to be comparable  @xcite .",
    "the possible range of values for @xmath13 is one reason why tests with many different pairs of clocks is valuable .",
    "a convenient gravitational potential to use for an lpi test is the solar potential experienced on earth ; due to the earth s elliptical orbit , this varies annually as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16  rad / day , and @xmath17 is the phase such that @xmath18 is a minimum at aphelion , such as modified julian day 55746 ( july 4 , 2011 ) .",
    "( the additional variation in potential due to the earth s rotation about its axis is @xmath19 for our latitude and is ignored here . )",
    "the difference in lpi - violating parameters for two atomic clocks of different composition can be measured by determining the size of the annual oscillation with the appropriate phase in the clocks relative frequency .    over the past decade measurements of this sort",
    "have been made using a variety of pairs of atomic species  @xcite , summarized in fig .",
    "[ f.past_measurements ] . in almost all previous measurements",
    "absolute frequencies of a certain type of atomic clock are compared to a cesium standard over many years , with typically several ( fractional ) frequency comparisons at the @xmath20 level per year .",
    "we implement a different approach , where each of the atomic clocks used is in continuous operation , providing a much higher rate of frequency comparisons and resulting in a more efficient lpi test .",
    "we measure the output frequencies of clocks based on hyperfine transitions in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 over 1.5 years .",
    "frequency comparisons between any two of the atomic species can be made with a statistical uncertainty of @xmath21 in a day or two , resulting in several hundred data points per year of precision comparable to previous tests .    .",
    "( a ) dark data points are previous measurements : ( i ) neutral strontium optical transition against cesium standard , carried out over 2.5  years  @xcite@xcite ; ( ii ) mercury ion optical transition against cesium standard , carried out over 5  years  @xcite ; ( iii ) hydrogen hyperfine transition against cesium standard , carried out over 7  years  @xcite ; and ( iv ) rubidium-87 hyperfine transition against cesium standard , carried out over 14  years  @xcite .",

    "because we do not evaluate absolute frequencies , we have to be confident that our clocks outputs are stable or change in knowable , predictable ways .",
    "this is accomplished by maintaining a continuous record of a clock s frequency against a variety of other clocks , enabling us to determine if discontinuous changes in frequency or drift rate occur .",
    "the us  naval observatory ( usno ) has a large ensemble of atomic clocks used for precise time  @xcite , including commercial cesium - beam clocks , hydrogen masers , and recently added rubidium - fountain clocks , which have been in operation for 1.5 years  @xcite .",
    "all clocks are measured regularly against a master reference , which enables a comparison between any two clocks .",
    "the collection of each type of clock can be used to generate one or more stationary outputs representing that ensemble .",
    "the rubidium frequency record used for lpi tests is an average of the frequencies of the two highest performing fountains over the past 1.5 years .",
    "comparisons among rubidium fountains demonstrate that these two clocks exhibit extremely stable frequencies with white - frequency noise levels below @xmath22 .",
    "the fountains show no indication of frequency drift at the level of @xmath23/day , as determined by using cesium - fountain primary standards that contribute to international atomic time as a reference . as a baseline",
    ", we look for an lpi - violating signal in the frequency comparison of the two rubidium fountains .",
    "the result is 0",
    "well within the error bar , indicating no bias in measurements using these clocks .",
    "about 70 commercial cesium clocks are intercompared to create a single output used for our lpi analysis  @xcite .",
    "the output of this cesium ensemble is characterized by a white - frequency noise level of @xmath24 and shows a drift in fractional frequency of @xmath25/day over the period in question .",
    "there is no long frequency record for an individual cesium clock without adjustments based on the performance of the ensemble , so there is no way to measure an lpi - violating baseline for the individual clocks .",
    "hydrogen masers generally exhibit complicated behavior over long averaging times ( months ) .",
    "they are known to be sensitive to environmental factors , which can cause frequency discontinuities in addition to less violent perturbations , and they exhibit significant frequency drifts , which may not be linear and which can change in time . of the @xmath26 hydrogen masers available to us",
    ", a subset is ruled out for these lpi tests because they exhibit discontinuous changes in frequency or drift rate during the interval of time that we are interested in .",
    "further assessing which masers to include requires careful analysis of the frequency records of different masers compared against each other as well as against the rubidium and cesium clocks used in the analysis , as discussed further below .",
    "the maser short - term frequency stability is better than that of either of the other types of clock used for these lpi tests .",
    "the white - frequency noise level of a maser - fountain comparison is typically of the order of @xmath27 , limited by noise in the frequency - counter measurement system .",
    "some masers are also measured with a dual - mixer measurement system , in which case a maser - fountain comparison exhibits a white - frequency noise level limited by fountain performance .    in order to measure @xmath28 for a pair of atomic species we need to examine the relative frequency record for an annual oscillation with phase @xmath17 in the presence of a drift .",
    "we limit our analysis to clocks that show a frequency drift that is linear , which , for a @xmath29-year interval , has little impact on the determination of the sinusoid amplitude . applying a least - squares fit using a function that is a combination of drift and oscillation gives results identical to fitting the frequency record to a line and then fitting those residuals to a sinusoid .",
    "we use the latter procedure for presenting data in the figures below .",
    "all relative frequency measurements participating in the fit derive from averaging intervals resulting in white frequency noise , consistent with application of least - squares curve fitting .",
    "application of this procedure to a rubidium - cesium lpi test is straightforward .",
    "figure  [ f.rb-cs](a ) shows the fractional frequency difference between the cesium ensemble and the average of rubidium fountains over 1.5 years .",
    "raw data are recorded at hourly intervals ; the plots in the figure show the frequency averaged over 2 days .",
    "the graph includes a fit indicating a relative drift of @xmath25/day . in fig .",
    "[ f.rb-cs](b ) , the residuals after removing the drift are fit to an lpi - violating signal , shown amplified in the graph .",
    "the amplitude for this fit is @xmath30 ( all uncertainties are 1 standard deviation ) .",
    "this translates to a difference in redshift anomalies of @xmath31    .",
    "mjd stands for modified julian day.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      from the subset of masers that exhibit no apparent discontinuities in frequency or drift over all or a large portion of the past 1.5 years , we need to establish which masers have frequency records that are truly linear , without higher order terms .",
    "some masers obviously exhibit frequencies that change in time in a nonlinear way and can be removed from consideration . to rule out masers with a more subtle nonlinear behavior , we rely on the quality of the least - squares fit to the relative frequency record of a maser and the rubidium average  @xcite . if the data do not fit well , as indicated by the reduced @xmath32 and a visual inspection of the residuals , the maser",
    "is not included in the analysis .",
    "we attribute a poor fit to unmodeled behavior in the maser ; this procedure leaves us with four masers in the lpi analysis .",
    "it is possible that these four masers still display unmodeled behavior , which mimics an lpi - violating signal . such unmodeled behavior would not be surprising since the phase of the lpi - violating signal is close to that of the seasonal cycle .",
    "we asses this by looking at all six possible pairs of the four masers for an lpi - violating signal .",
    "these measurements enable a @xmath0 to be determined for each maser that serves as a baseline for remaining unmodeled behavior .",
    "each @xmath0 value serves as a bias and is subtracted from the measured lpi - violating signal for each maser - rubidium or maser - cesium comparison .",
    "once this bias is included in a clock comparison using a given maser , the final uncertainty for that comparison is the combined statistical uncertainty from the lpi fit and the uncertainty associated with the bias .    in order to account for the different uncertainties associated with each maser ,",
    "the hydrogen results are determined by measuring lpi - violating amplitudes for each of the four masers against the cesium and rubidium clocks and combining them in a weighted average  @xcite .",

    "the limit on the precision of the rubidium - hydrogen test is a combination of white - frequency noise from the measurement system and uncertainty in the lpi - mimicking amplitude for each maser .",
    "while these uncertainties should also improve with longer fitting times , the unpredictable nature of masers makes this less certain .",
    "even now , with an uncertainty on the rubidium - hydrogen measurement in the mid @xmath49s , this very precise lpi test could remain competitive for the near - future .",
    "while relative frequency measurements of two optical clocks should yield much more stringent limits , many optical clock frequencies are measured against the cesium standard , limiting the precision to a level governed by a microwave transition .",
    "furthermore , our continuous clock measurements are competitive with lpi tests that could be implemented in near - term space missions .",
    "clock experiments intended for the international space station  @xcite could improve upon the precision of absolute redshift measurements but not differential measurements ; the driving term due to the solar potential is the same as on earth , and there is no driving term from the earth s potential due to the station s circular orbit . in terms of space clocks , improvements to differential redshift tests of lpi could result from proposed missions that would put clocks in a highly eccentric earth orbit  @xcite or a solar system escape trajectory  @xcite .    in summary",
