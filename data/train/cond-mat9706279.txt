    "for polar solids , careful treatment of the polarization is mandatory , even if no homogeneous electric field is present  @xcite .",
    "resta  @xcite tried to address the origin of these effects : he proposed that the polarization dependence should arise from the coulomb coupling between the electron , in the bulk , and part of its correlation hole delocalized at the surface . at variance , martin and ortiz  @xcite , pointed out that the shape of the xc hole may already depend on the surface charge , and we demonstrated  @xcite that a polarization - dependence is expected at the purely exchange level ( without correlation ) . in another paper , martin and ortiz  @xcite placed the new density - polarization functional theory in the perspective of important works of the seventies , and presented an alternative formulation of it .",

    "if the kohn - sham system is metallic to start with , @xmath82 has no divergence , and @xmath87 for short wavevectors will vanish .",
    "thus , the corrections needed to obtain an insulating - like polarizability while the kohn - sham system is metallic are entirely due to the correlation kernel . in the adiabatic coupling constant construction of the xc energy  @xcite ,",
