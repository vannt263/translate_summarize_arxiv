    "the formation and evolution of stars strongly affects the chemistry of their molecular environment .",
    "in particular , sulfur - bearing molecules show enhanced abundances in the hot molecular cores , the condensations associated with massive protostars .",
    "the most accepted idea is that during the collapse of a star forming cloud , a large fraction of the available sulfur freezes out by accretion onto grain mantles and hydrogenates in the form of h@xmath0s .",
    "the high temperatures and turbulent motions in these objects produced by the newly formed stars induce the evaporation and disruption of grain mantles , releasing the h@xmath0s into the gas phase . after evaporation , this molecule is believed to drive a fast high temperature gas - phase chemistry leading first to the formation of so and so@xmath0 and subsequently of other sulfur - bearing molecules such as cs and h@xmath0cs @xcite .",
    "it is still uncertain whether the release of h@xmath0s is caused exclusively by thermal evaporation or whether shocks play a role in the disruption of the grain mantles @xcite . in low mass star - forming regions , where the temperatures are not high enough to evaporate the grain mantles , there is evidence that shocks may be responsible for injecting the h@xmath0s from ices into the gas - phase @xcite .",
    "sulfur - bearing molecules are considered to be an important tool for studying the presence of shocks within massive star - forming regions .",
    "time - dependent chemical models have roughly succeeded to reproduce the observed abundances of the most common sulfur - bearing species both in high and low mass star - forming regions @xcite .    in starburst galaxies like ngc253 , only the most abundant sulfur - bearing molecules have been detected so far , namely cs , ocs , so @xcite , and recently also so@xmath0 and ns @xcite .",
    "extragalactic h@xmath0s has only been detected toward the large magellanic cloud , where h@xmath0cs is also tentatively detected @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the first detection of h@xmath0s and the tentative detection of h@xmath0cs in ngc253 , allowing us to investigate for the first time the sulfur chemistry in its nuclear region using a set of the most abundant sulfur - bearing species .",
    "most of the observations of the molecular species listed in table  [ tab : fits ] were carried out with the iram 30 m telescope on pico veleta ( spain ) .",
    "the measurements were made in symmetrical wobbler switching mode with a frequency of 0.5hz and a beamthrow of @xmath10 in azimuth . as spectrometers ,",
    "we used two @xmath11mhz filterbanks for the transitions at 2 mm and two @xmath12mhz filterbanks for those at 3 mm .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 transitions of cs were measured with the 15 m swedish - eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ) at la silla ( chile ) .",
    "observations were done in wide dual beam switch mode , with @xmath15 beam throw in azimuth .",
    "acousto optical spectrometers were used as backends with a resolution of 1.4mhz .",
    "beam sizes ranged from @xmath16 ( at 85ghz ) to @xmath17 ( at 196ghz ) for the 30 m telescope and from @xmath18 ( at 98ghz ) to @xmath19 ( at 244ghz ) for the sest . in both telescopes ,",
    "receivers were tuned to single side band with an image band rejection larger than 10db .",
    "the spectra were calibrated with a dual load system .",
    "[ fig : transitions ] shows the observed line profiles of cs and two of its isotopic substitutions ( @xmath9cs and c@xmath4s ) , h@xmath0s , so , h@xmath0cs , and ocs , as well as the corresponding gaussian fits .",
    "for most of the observed transitions , we identify two velocity components , which arise from molecular cloud complexes at two opposing sides of the nucleus @xcite , located at @xmath20 ne ( the 180kms@xmath21 component ) and @xmath22 sw ( the 280kms@xmath21 component ) as revealed by interferometric maps @xcite .",
    "the derived parameters from the gaussian fits to the observed profiles are shown in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "while most of the transitions of the main isotopic species of cs have already been reported @xcite , the improved signal - to - noise ratios of our data allow us for the first time to separate the two main velocity components in the line profiles .",
    "unfortunately , the 2 mm lines of h@xmath0cs appear to be blended with other lines .",
    "the @xmath23 transition is blended with the h@xmath24 recombination line and the @xmath25 transition is contaminated by a contribution of the cs @xmath26 line from the image band . in order to perform",
    "the gaussian fits to the h@xmath0cs lines , we have respectively subtracted a gaussian profile similar to that observed for the h@xmath27 line measured at 160ghz and the cs @xmath26 emission measured in the signal band corrected by the corresponding image gain . as seen in the lower panel of the h@xmath0cs lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitions ] , the cs and the h@xmath0cs lines do not fully account for the observed feature .",
    "the extra emission could be due to the presence of another unidentified line . in spite of the uncertainties due to the blending , both resulting h@xmath0cs profiles are self - consistent , since they are expected to have similar intensities .",
    "nevertheless , this detection must be regarded as tentative .",
    "similarly , the ocs @xmath28 transition appears blended with the @xmath29 line of hc@xmath30o@xmath31 .",
    "additional observation of the hc@xmath30o@xmath31 @xmath13 transition at 170ghz allowed us to estimate and subtract the contribution of this species to the observed feature , by assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) with an excitation temperature @xmath3212k .      in order to derive the physical properties of the molecular material we need to make an assumption on the total emission extent of the molecular emitting region . by smoothing the interferometric cs data from @xcite",
    ", @xcite derived the dependence of the observed line intensity on the beam size .",
    "this dependence indicates an equivalent source size of @xmath33 for the cs emitting region .",
    "the interferometer maps of cs only miss 36% of the flux @xcite suggesting that the extent of the cs emission is not much larger than this estimate . as we have no additional information on the extent of the emission of the other rarer species",
    ", we will assume them to be similar to that of cs .",
    "this assumption is supported by the comparison of the high angular resolution maps of the cs emission with those of species with a fairly different chemistry such as sio , h@xmath9co@xmath31 @xcite and nh@xmath34 ( m. lebron , private communication ) , where the morphology of the emission seems to be similar .",
    "we have derived source averaged column densities by correcting the measured line intensities for the estimated source size of @xmath35 assuming optically thin emission .",
    "the corresponding population diagrams for cs , so , and ocs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "for cs we show the population diagrams for the two velocity components at 180 and 280kms@xmath21 and we derive a rotational temperature @xmath36k for both components . in these diagrams , the population in the @xmath37 level , clearly above the linear fit , shows evidence for the presence of a lower excitation temperature component with @xmath38k which can be explained by the much larger region observed by the @xmath18 beam of the sest . as derived below , the cs emission is moderately optically thick .",
    "the effect of the opacity on the population diagram would result in a slight increase of the derived excitation temperatures .",
    "thus we would get temperatures of @xmath39k and @xmath40k for the two components .",
    "to derive the cs column density in table  [ tab : molecdensity ] we have used the optically thin emission of one of its isotopes , @xmath9cs . for ocs",
    "we derive a @xmath41k .",
    "our estimate of the ocs column density in table  [ tab : molecdensity ] is in agreement with that derived by @xcite when the differences in the assumed source size are taken into account . for the 180kms@xmath21 component of",
    "so we obtain a @xmath42k . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] , the 280kms@xmath21 component of the so @xmath43 transition ( e@xmath44k ) has a higher intensity than expected if we assume , from the cs results , both components to have a similar rotational temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] ) .",
    "this may be due to the contamimation of this component by the emission feature observed at a velocity of @xmath45 kms@xmath21 which we tentatively identify as the @xmath46 transition of nh@xmath0cn ( cyanamide ) .",
    "the measured integrated intensity has been then considered as an upper limit as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : diagrams ] . we have therefore assumed a similar excitation temperature of 23k for both velocity components to compute the column density of the 280kms@xmath21 component of so .",
    "since we have only one transition for h@xmath0s and the two observed lines of h@xmath0cs have the same upper level energy , we need to make an assumption on the excitation temperature of these species . as the einstein coefficients of these transitions are similar to those of cs and so@xmath0 , we will take an excitation temperature of 12k for both species according to that derived from cs in this work , and from so@xmath0 by @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : molecdensity ] shows the derived source averaged column densities , rotational temperatures and fractional abundances relative to h@xmath0 for all the sulfur bearing molecules detected towards the nucleus of ngc253 .",
    "the main sources of uncertainty in the derived abundances are those from the assumed extent of the emitting region and the h@xmath0 column density , which are assumed to be the same for all the species . assuming the extreme case in which the molecular emission is confined to a much smaller region of @xmath47 the derived source averaged column densities will be larger by less than a factor 2 .",
    "however , these uncertainties are expected to be even smaller when column density ratios between different species are considered .",
    "a similar argument also applies to the uncertainties in the derived fractional abundances introduced by the assumed h@xmath0 column density if , as already discussed , the spatial distribution among different species does not vary substantially . since we will focus our discussion on the molecular abundance ratios between different species",
    ", these uncertainties will not affect our conclusions .",
    "given that the @xmath26 transition of cs , @xmath9cs , and c@xmath4s were observed with the same telescope we can compare the observed @xmath48cs to @xmath9cs line intensity ratio of @xmath49 with the @xmath48c/@xmath9c ratio of @xmath50 estimated by @xcite .",
    "assuming that the @xmath48cs/@xmath9cs intensity ratio reflects the @xmath48c/@xmath9c abundance ratio , we derive an optical depth for the @xmath48cs@xmath26 transition of @xmath51 . therefore from the measured @xmath9cs / c@xmath4s line intensities and the @xmath48c/@xmath9c ratio mentioned above we derive a @xmath3s/@xmath4s abundance ratio of @xmath52 . from our non detection of the c@xmath7s line ,",
    "it is possible to give a @xmath53 lower limit to the @xmath4s/@xmath7s ratio of @xmath54 .",
    "the line intensities corrected for beam dilution of the four observed transitions of cs and the @xmath26 lines of @xmath9cs and c@xmath4s have been compared with the results of model calculations for the excitation of cs in which the large velocity gradient approximation has been used .",
    "a linewidth of 100kms@xmath21 and a kinetic temperature @xmath55=100k ( similar to the rotational temperature of 100142k derived from nh@xmath34 measurements by @xcite ) have been considered in these non - lte calculations .",
    "[ fig : cslvg ] shows the results of this model for the observed line intensities and line ratios .",
    "the grey region corresponds to the best fit to the observed cs main isotope line intensities , calculated by minimizing the reduced @xmath56 function as described by @xcite .",
    "the best fit gives a cs column density n(cs)=@xmath57@xmath58 and a molecular hydrogen density n(h@xmath0)=@xmath59@xmath60 for the velocity component at 180kms@xmath21 and n(cs)=@xmath57@xmath58 and n(h@xmath0)=@xmath61@xmath60 for that at 280kms@xmath21 .",
    "these column densities are a factor of two lower than those in table  [ tab : molecdensity ] derived from the isotopomer @xmath9cs assuming lte conditions .",
    "the h@xmath0 density derived from this analysis depends on the assumed kinetic temperature .",
    "therefore , a @xmath55 of 50k or 25k would lead to h@xmath0 densities a factor of 2 and 4 higher respectively .",
    "the choice of @xmath55 has , however , almost no effect on the column density determination .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cslvg ] shows , the best fit contour does not cover the @xmath13 data at a probability level of 99.5@xmath62 .",
    "this fact suggests that the cs emission is best explained if one consider several gas components in the region covered by the telescope beam .",
    "these components are related to the need of two different excitation temperatures to fit the population diagram .",
    "the @xmath13 to @xmath63 ratio of 1.5 derived by @xcite , also plotted in fig  [ fig : cslvg ] , supports this scenario .",
    "for the 180kms@xmath21 velocity component ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cslvg](a ) ) a higher density component ( n(h@xmath0)@xmath64 @xmath60 ) explains the @xmath65 transitions , and a lower density component ( n(h@xmath0)@xmath66 @xmath60 ) , with a 3 times higher column density , explains the lower @xmath67 transitions .",
    "similar results , within the errors , can be derived for the 280kms@xmath21 component .    from the non - lte calculations we derive c@xmath3s / c@xmath4s ratios of 49 and @xmath48cs/@xmath9cs ratios of 2235 for the 180 and 280kms@xmath21 velocity components respectively .",
    "the @xmath48cs/@xmath9cs intensity ratio obtained for the 180kms@xmath21 component is half the @xmath48c/@xmath9c ratio estimated by @xcite while that obtained for the 280kms@xmath21 component is closer to their value .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the @xmath9cs observation by @xcite where made towards a position @xmath68 closer to the emission peak of the 280kms@xmath21 component .",
    "we find that most of the sulfur - bearing species detected towards the nuclear region of ngc253 show similar fractional abundances of a few 10@xmath1 ( table  [ tab : molecdensity ] ) . only cs and ocs have abundances a factor of @xmath69 higher . in order to understand the mechanism that dominates the chemistry in the nuclear environment of ngc253 we summarize in table  [ tab : comparison ] the fractional abundances of all the sulfur - bearing molecules detected towards this starburst galaxy and those observed towards selected galactic sources ( hot cores , galactic center clouds , dark clouds , photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) and shocks driven by massive protostars ) which are dominated by different kinds of chemistry .",
    "the abundance ratios discussed on this section are also shown in table  [ tab : comparison ] .",
    "the so@xmath0 abundance in pdrs is much lower , by a factor of 40 , than that found in ngc253 .",
    "thus , abundance ratios such as h@xmath0s / so@xmath0 and cs / so@xmath0 can be used to establish the role of photodissociation in the chemistry of ngc253 .",
    "particularly instructive is the so / so@xmath0 abundance ratio .",
    "so / so@xmath0 @xmath70 towards pdrs is about two orders of magnitude larger than that in ngc253 which suggests that photodissociation does not play a major role in the chemistry of its nuclear region .",
    "a comparison with dark clouds shows a clearly lower abundance of ocs than that observed towards ngc253 .",
    "the ocs / so ratio is 0.1 and 0.4 in l134n and tmc-1 respectively , while we measure @xmath71 in ngc253 . the abundance ratios of so@xmath0/so and h@xmath0s / so of @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively measured towards these dark clouds are also much smaller than the corresponding ratios of @xmath74 observed towards ngc253 .",
    "therefore , dark molecular clouds like l134n and tmc-1 do not seem to dominate the molecular composition near the nucleus of ngc253 .",
    "chemistry driven by high velocity shocks in molecular outflows also differs significantly from the chemistry found in ngc253 .",
    "the ocs / so ratio measured towards these sources is two orders of magnitude smaller than that in ngc253 , while cs / h@xmath0s is three orders of magnitude lower .",
    "the large abundance of h@xmath0s , as well as the low abundance of molecules such as cs , ocs , and h@xmath0cs in local molecular outflows , is not observed in ngc253 .",
    "as far as the hot cores are concerned , the molecular abundances vary significantly between galactic sources .",
    "different evolutionary states may account for these observed differences .",
    "as seen in table  [ tab : comparison ] the abundance ratios in the orion hot core mostly disagree with those in ngc253 .",
    "the relative abundances of most of the species towards sgrb2(n ) are similar to what we find in ngc253 except for the underabundance of h@xmath0s and ocs with respect to the other molecules . the ratio ocs",
    "/ so is almost two orders of magnitude lower in both hot cores than in ngc253 .",
    "in addition , the low rotational temperatures ( @xmath75k ) derived for all the sulfur - bearing species in ngc253 suggest that the observed emission can not be due to hot cores where much higher rotational temperatures are expected ( @xmath76k ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the molecular abundances of so@xmath0 , no , and ns are similar to those found in the envelope of the sgrb2 molecular complex .",
    "table  [ tab : comparison ] also includes the comparison with two different clouds in the envelope of sgrb2 .",
    "the first position , labeled sgrb2(oh ) , is located @xmath77 south of sgrb2 m , and the second one @xmath78 north - east of sgrb2 m .",
    "so@xmath0 , so , and h@xmath0cs abundances in the galactic center clouds agree well with those observed towards ngc253 .",
    "ocs / so abundances ratios of 5 and 9 are similar to the ratio of @xmath71 found in ngc253 .",
    "our study of the sulfur chemistry towards the nuclear region of ngc253 seems to indicate a chemistry similar to that of the envelope of sgrb2 where low velocity shocks are thought to be the main heating mechanism of the molecular material @xcite .",
    "the low rotational temperatures derived for ngc253 are also in agreement with those derived by @xcite in the sgrb2 envelope .",
    "these results support the idea of large scale low velocity shocks driving the chemistry of the inner molecular material in the nucleus of ngc253 which is consistent with the high rotational temperatures derived from nh@xmath34 and the large observed sio abundances @xcite .      in order to get an insight into the dominant chemistry around the central region of ngc253",
    ", we compare our results with those available from chemical models @xcite .",
    "for this we will assume that the whole nuclear region of ngc253 can be described as a single molecular cloud .",
    "this is not likely as we are observing a 200pc region where a number of unresolved molecular complexes with different physical and chemical properties coexist .",
    "nevertheless , the dominant observed chemistry in the nuclear region of ngc253 could be characterized by a single giant cloud as observed for the envelope of sgrb2 which has a size of @xmath79pc .",
    "the sio mapping of the galactic center region show molecular cloud complexes extended over even larger scales @xcite .",
    "we have compared the observed molecular abundances in ngc253 with the time - dependent models used by @xcite and @xcite to describe the chemistry of hot cores and low mass protostars respectively .",
    "these models assume the release of h@xmath0s from grain mantles as the main precursor of the sulfur chemistry .",
    "models with @xmath80 and n(h@xmath0)@xmath81 seem to best reproduce the abundances measured for so@xmath0 , so , h@xmath0s , and h@xmath0cs shown in table  [ tab : comparison ] .",
    "this result is in agreement with the idea that the emission from the nuclear region of ngc253 is dominated by low excitation temperature and moderately dense molecular clouds similar to those found in the galactic center clouds .",
    "however current chemical models fall short of accounting for the observed abundances of ocs by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "it has been pointed out by @xcite and @xcite that ocs may play an important role in the chemistry of sulfur - bearing molecules .",
    "near - ir observations of massive protostars @xcite show that sulfur may freeze out onto grains not only in the form of h@xmath0s but also in the form of ocs .",
    "in fact ocs is the only sulfur bearing molecule detected so far in icy grain mantles .",
    "this would imply that ocs is also sputtered from grains by shocks . @xcite",
    "revised the chemical model by including an initial large abundance of ocs as well as reducing that of h@xmath0s , assuming these species are initially injected into the gas phase .",
    "these models , depending on the initially injected h@xmath0s and ocs @xcite , may account for the high ocs abundance observed in the nuclear region of ngc253 .",
    "the @xmath3s/@xmath4s abundance ratios of @xmath52 and @xmath82 observed towards the nuclear starburst environment of ngc253 ( sect .",
    "[ sect : results ] ) and ngc4945 @xcite respectively are similar to those found within the galactic inner 3kpc region , but considerably lower than the value of @xmath83 measured in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the estimated lower limit of the @xmath4s/@xmath7s ratio towards ngc253 is higher than the abundance of @xmath84 measured towards most of the galactic sources studied by @xcite .    massive stars , as well as type ib / c and ii supernovae , appear to slightly overproduce @xmath4s and underproduce @xmath7s compared to @xmath3s ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "thus , the compact stellar clusters observed near the center of ngc253 @xcite and the estimated overall star formation rate of 3.6m@xmath85yr@xmath21 @xcite and supernova rate ( snr ) of 0.050.3yr@xmath21 @xcite might account for the low @xmath3s/@xmath4s as well as the enhanced @xmath4s/@xmath7s ratios in ngc253 .",
    "this fact is supported by the high massive star formation rate of @xmath86m@xmath85yr@xmath21 estimated by @xcite for the inner @xmath87 of this starburst .",
    "uncertainties are large enough that the @xmath3s/@xmath4s ratio observed towards ngc253 may not significantly differ from that in ngc4945 , where slightly higher star formation and supernova rates @xcite might also have induced an overproduction of @xmath4s in its nuclear region .",
