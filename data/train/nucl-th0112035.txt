    "electromagnetic radiation constitutes a privileged probe of the properties of matter under extreme conditions .",

    "do not have this desired short lifetime , in the medium they might undergo sufficient broadening leading to a shorter lifetime @xcite .",
    "for the present purpose , however , we first mostly concentrate on the @xmath2 meson and we discuss the scalar - isovector sector later on .",
    "the in - medium properties of the @xmath2 meson have been estimated in variety of models ranging from qcd sum - rules @xcite to chiral models like nambu - jona lasinio , effective hadronic lagrangian approaches @xcite and mean - field models .",
    "it is fair to say that , at this point , a clear consensus is still lacking but that important progress has been realized over the past few years . for a review see @xcite .",
    "the angle of this work consists of uniting several physical aspects we find important but that had not been treated together in a unique approach .",
    "so here , the @xmath2 spectral density in dense nuclear matter is studied and the importance of the @xmath6(1520 ) and @xmath6(1720 ) is reiterated , but a relativistic calculation is performed and we go beyond the linear density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "a relativistic calculation has recently been presented in @xcite in the lda .",
    "we show that lda is a good approximation for densities below nuclear matter density , but for higher densities multiple scattering becomes important .",
    "we report a quantitative comparison of the results obtained in the linear approximation with a resummed one loop calculation .",
    "we also incorporate the effect of interacting nuclear matter through the scalar and vector meson mean fields , motivated by the walecka model . the role of resonances and",
    "that of the nucleon loops are examined separately .",
    "finally , we include the recently discussed mixing effects @xcite , and report on the spectral density of the @xmath3 for the first time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first the formalism is outlined followed by a discussion of the @xmath2 meson properties involving nucleons .",
    "then we consider the effect of the resonances on the in - medium spectral densities .",
    "later we discuss the effect of mixing .",
    "we also present the spectral density of the @xmath3 meson which supplements our understanding of the mixed propagator of the @xmath2 in nuclear matter .",
    "the calculations are done in a fully relativistic formalism including the effect of the mean field . at places the mathematical details",
    "are relegated to the appendix .",
    "finally we discuss the results and conclude .",
    "it is well known that the spectral density is actually the imaginary part of the propagator which in turn is related with the polarization functions of the meson .",
    "therefore , we first discuss the properties of the @xmath2 meson polarization function in dense nuclear matter .    essentially , the spectral density is related with the collective excitation induced by the @xmath2 meson by its propagation in nuclear matter .",
    "this is analogous to the photon propagation in qed plasma where the propagating particle picks up the collective modes from the system arising out of the density fluctuation .",
    "this is commonly known as plasma oscillation .",
    "even though in the present work the main focus is not to recover the characteristic features of the plasma oscillation induced by the @xmath2 meson , nevertheless , we outline the formalism _  la _",
    "chin@xcite in order to be able to discuss the spectral density in terms of the dielectric response function of the nuclear matter .",
    "this enables us to incorporate the effect of meson mixing in a straightforward manner @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 meson , being a massive spin one particle , can have both longitudinal and transverse excitations depending upon whether its momenta is perpendicular or parallel to the spin .",
    "furthermore , in matter the lorentz symmetry is broken and these two modes will have different characteristic features . these states are designated as @xmath7 , @xmath8 with l and t denoting longitudinal and transverse modes .    as already mentioned , we consider the coupling of @xmath2 meson with n",
    "- n , n - r and @xmath9-@xmath9 states and therefore what we have is the following ^l(t)= _ nn^l(t)+ _ rn^l(t)+ _ ^l(t ) , with @xmath10 .",
    "first we present a general formalism without the effect of mixing and later we shall address the issue of the possible mixing and of the corresponding modifications .    to describe the nuclear matter ground state we invoke the mean field approach of quantum hadrodynamics and consequently the effective nucleon mass is generated through the @xmath11 meson tadpole of scalar mean field potential @xcite .",
    "the nucleon mass is determined by solving the following equation self - consistently . m_n^",
    "* = m_n -4()^2_0^k_f .",
    "to study the collective excitation of the system , the relevant quantity is the dielectric function which actually characterizes the eigenvalue condition for the collective modes . in the language of field theory",
    "this is equivalent to solving the schwinger - dyson equation to determine the dressed propagator .",

    "@xcite .",

    "in the present work we present quantitative results of the in - medium meson properties . the meson spectral densities are evaluated for the first time in a fully relativistic mean field model which goes beyond linear density approximation and we discuss the limitation of the aplicability of lda . we find that meson spectral densities in matter are quite different than in free space .",
    "the difference stems partly from the lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "while in free space the transverse and longitudinal component of the @xmath2 spectral density are degenerate , in matter , they show different qualitative behaviour . furthermore",
    ", we include other purely in - medium effects , forbidden in vacuum on the account of lorentz symmetry , like meson mixing . in matter",
    "the @xmath2 can also be modified because of its mixing with a scalar ( isovector ) @xmath3 meson .",
    "this effect , as we have seen , modifies only the longitudinal component of the spectral density .",
    "in our model we observe that the @xmath2 meson spectral density gets flattened in nuclear matter with the incorporation of the resonant states like @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in fact in nuclear matter the original free space peak of the @xmath2 meson become so broadened that it is no longer possible to interpret that as a quasi - particle excitation .",
    "this was also observed in ref .",
    "it should also be noted that in presence of scalar mean field the @xmath2 meson mass goes down as a function of density .    this broadened of @xmath2",
    "spectral density shows an accumulation of strength towards lower invariant mass region .",
    "this would definitely imply that in more production of dilepton pairs with low invariant mass in access to what we might expect from the free @xmath2 spectral density .",
    "we plan to extend this work to the finite temperature region in the near future .",
    "furthermore , the broadened @xmath2 spectral density would also affect the width of the resonance states like @xmath0 or @xmath1 which probably would shed some light on the issue of mixing resonant states in the photoabsorption cross - sections .",
    "for the complete determination of the @xmath2 spectral density and the broadening of the resonant state , a self - consistent approach should be adopted @xcite .",
