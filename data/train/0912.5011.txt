    "physicists and mathematicians have different language and different logics .",
    "namely , a mathematician first formulates the conditions , then the theorem ( the formula ) , and only after this proves it .",
    "a physicist , conversely , first derives a formula , which he makes rather convincingly , but he often conceals the conditions assuming them to be obvious . as a rule , mathematicians prove theorems , which have already been `` known '' to physicists in the sense that the physicists have been using them explicitly or implicitly for a long time .",
    "there is a series of rather well - known theorems bearing the names of their authors , which were formulated in a different language and , in fact , had been already proved by the physicists .",
    "the results of mathematicians who are translators to the mathematical language were especially easily and rapidly understood by the mathematical community .    sometimes , a mathematician , who also obtained new results in physics and , in addition , tried to explain them in the physical language , was not taken as a mathematician by the mathematical community , and he had to prove this separately .    the author also happened to obtain several results concerning the area of interests of those who doubted , see  @xcite ,  @xcite , and the work  @xcite continued in  @xcite ( how levsha had to `` show a flea '' ) , in order to make the mathematical community to acknowledge him .",
    "similarly , it is difficult to make the physicists to believe that the mathematicians , who follow rigorous logics , can obtain results that are paradoxical from the point of view of customary understanding .",
    "physicists are not convinced even by the fact that the mathematical results correspond to well - known experiments and predict new experiments , which are in a rather good agreement with the theoretical calculations .",
    "one of my friends , a famous physicist , used to tell me : `` you do not convince me by your lemmas '' .    in the second part of the famous book of feynman and hibbs about continual integrals , the unrigorous logics of feynman continuous integrals ( which was useful for physicists ) led to the rigorous results obtained by norman wiener twenty years ago ( no reference was made ) .",
    "the author had to `` prove '' the semiclassical asymptotics of the feynman continuous integrals ( he proved it indirectly somewhat earlier ) according to the feynman logics ( v.  guillemin and s.  sternberg repeated the proof in  @xcite , but fairly quoted the word `` proof '' ) .",
    "the `` rules of the game '' developed by physicists are very useful , because they allow them to `` jump over '' the mathematical difficulties and hence to proceed significantly faster .",
    "their physical intuition developed in experiments in different areas of physics helps them to feel the result empirically , especially if the numerical data are known .",
    "the latter allows them to avoid complicated asymptotics in several small parameters and a nonstandard analysis . in the first aspect ( the intuition ) , i was always surprised by b.  l.  ginzburg ; in the second aspect ( the knowledge of numerical data ) , by ya .",
    "b.  zeldovich , who , even speaking over phone , could mentally calculate whether or not a given theorem corresponds to physics .",
    "if a mathematician does not have any physical intuition ( for example , just as the author ) , then he can be severely disappointed considering some well - known physical law as an axiom and obtaining an answer contradicting the experimental data .",
    "therefore , prior to presenting mathematically rigorous results , which correspond to the unsolved problems of chemistry ( and even of alchemy , because the term `` fluids '' was introduced by alchemists on the critical isotherm behaves as the 100% methanol in several extraction processes . in technology ,",
    "the supercritical water vapor is used in turbines in all thermal and nuclear power stations . ] ) , we show that some well - known , even `` eternal '' physical and mathematical `` verities '' turn out to be significantly refined in the case of rigorous mathematical verification .    to distinguish the classical theory in its modern understanding from the quantum theory , it is necessary somewhat to change the physicist s ideology that the classical theory is the theory that existed in the 19th century before the appearance of the quantum theory .",
    "but , in fact , the classical theory is the theory obtained from the quantum theory in the limit as @xmath0 .",
    "so feynman was right stating that spin is a phenomenon of classical mechanics .",
    "indeed , this is the case in rigorous passing to the limit from quantum to classical mechanics .",
    "similarly , the ray polarization does not disappear as the frequency increases and hence is a property of geometric rather than wave optics , as was used to think because the light polarization was discovered as a result of discovering the wave optics .",
    "we consider the `` lifshits well '' , i.e. , the one - dimensional schrdinger equation with potential symmetric with respect to the origin and having two wells .",
    "its eigenfunctions are symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the origin . as @xmath0 ,",
    "this symmetry remains unchanged , and since the squared modulus of the eigenfunction corresponds to the probability that a particle stays in the wells , it follows that , in the limit as @xmath1 , i.e. , `` in the classics '' , for energies less than the barrier height , the particle occurs between the wells , in the two wells at once , although the classical particle can not penetrate through the barrier .",
    "nevertheless , this simple example shows the variation in the ideology of the `` classical theory '' .    to understand this paradox , it is necessary to take into account that the symmetry must be very precise and the state stationarity means that this state appears in the limit of `` infinitely large '' time .",
    "as we show below , the same concerns the bose - distribution in the classical theory of gases .",
    "now we show how the existence of an additional parameter changes the representation in the classical limit .",
    "we dwell upon the notion , which is called `` collective oscillations '' in classical physics and  quaseparticles  in quantum physics . in classical physics , this is the vlasov equation of self - consistent ( or mean ) field , and in quantum physics , this is the hartree ( or hartree  fock ) equation .",
    "so we want to note the following point that seems to be paradoxical .",
    "the solutions of the equation in variations for the vlasov equation _ do not coincide _ with the classical limit for the equations in variations for the mean - field equation in the quantum theory .",
    "this is because of the fact that the variations are related to another small parameter , namely , the variation parameter . and",
    "this is already the field of nonstandard analysis .",
    "n.  n.  bogolyubov , for example , in @xcite , studied the problem without an external field , and the asymptotics thus obtained coincides with the semiclassical asymptotics in an external field @xcite ,  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "this is in fact the classical limit , because the parameter @xmath2 in this bogolyubov s paper can be compensated by a large parameter , namely , the wave number  @xmath3 .",
    "this becomes especially obvious if the interaction is assumed to be zero .",
    "then an ideal gas is obtained , which in this case can be considered as a classical gas .",
    "just therefore , the author proved that the classical fluids in nanotubes have superfluidity ( see @xcite ,  @xcite ) , which was confirmed by a series of experiments ( see the references in  @xcite ) .",
    "confusion is due to the fact that the constant  @xmath4 has dimension of action , and , rather often , in the classical limit , in order to keep the dimensions , it participates even in the maxwell distribution @xcite .",
    "for example , the thomas  fermi equations ( including the temperature equations ) are classical equations from the above point of view , but the fact that they contain the constant  @xmath4 leads to confusion .",
    "therefore , the van der waals law of corresponding states is very important , it allows us to consider the reduced temperatures @xmath5 and pressures @xmath6 as dimensionless quantities .",
    "now we consider the @xmath7-particle gibbs distribution @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hamiltonian .",
    "it is assumed that the level surfaces @xmath10 are simply connected .",
    "the theorem about this distribution was in fact proved in  @xcite .",
    "it must be considered in the sense of kolmogorov complexity .",
    "this distribution is the distribution over the number of different experiments whose number  @xmath11 is independent of  @xmath7 , over systems of @xmath7 particles at the same temperature ( the average distribution over the number of experiments ) , and it is the distribution over the energy surfaces @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are less than some average energy  @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the phase volume is @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "we divide the phase space @xmath22 into finitely many domains @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and , correspondingly , the phase space @xmath27 has coordinates @xmath28 .",
    "we perform ordered sampling with return @xmath29 from the partition of domains in the space @xmath27 into the `` box '' @xmath30 , under the condition that @xmath31    from the physical viewpoint , the ordered sampling means that  @xmath11 distinguishable @xmath32-dimensional particles are considered .",
    "let @xmath33 be the number of @xmath32-dimensional `` particles '' in the energy interval @xmath34 divided by  @xmath35 .",
    "assume that the above conditions on the function @xmath36 are satisfied .",
    "we determined @xmath11 from the condition is considered as average over the the number of particles , then @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the average energy over the number of experiments . ]",
    "@xmath39 where @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we determine @xmath18 in   as @xmath40 .",
    "then we have the following theorem .    [ theor2 ]",
    "the following relation holds : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is arbitrarily integer .",
    "here the probability @xmath43 is the lebesgue measure of the phase volume in parentheses in   with respect to the entire phase volume @xmath44 bounded by  .",
    "thus , the gibbs distribution is not a distribution over momenta and coordinates , but is a distribution over the energy levels .",
    "if the domain   is multiply connected , then the problem can be solved only by semiclassical transitions .",
    "if @xmath45 , then we formally obtain the maxwell  boltzmann distribution .",
    "but the latter is considered , as a rule , as the average distribution for @xmath7 particles .",
    "we discuss this treatment in remark  5 .",
    "boltzmann obtained his distribution integrating this distribution over  @xmath46 . but",
    "this can be done under the following conditions only .",
    "for a great many particles , their dependence on a common potential field must be assumed to be slowly varying as a rule . indeed ,",
    "if the particles are in a volume  @xmath47 ( or in an area  @xmath48 ) , then the thermodynamical asymptotics requires that the volume  @xmath47 ( the area  @xmath48 ) tend to infinity . but this means that the potential field varies very slowly , and it must be assumed that the function of the coordinates is of the form @xmath49{v}}).\\ ] ] otherwise , we have no rights to pass from the gibbs distribution from the maxwell  boltzmann distribution @xmath50 ( integrating it over the momenta ) to the boltzmann distribution of the form @xmath51 since the maxwell  boltzmann distribution is not a distribution of the density of the number of particles with respect to the momenta and coordinates",
    ". this distribution can give only the number of particles between energy levels of the form @xmath52 but if @xmath53 is of the form @xmath54{v}}),\\ ] ] then this integration can be done in the thermodynamical asymptotics as @xmath55 .",
    "one should not forget here that the boltzmann distribution is also far from being a distribution with respect to the coordinates  @xmath56 , and that it is a distribution with respect to level surfaces of the function @xmath53 only .",
    "there is a mathematical error in the very definition of thermodynamical limit as the limit as @xmath57 and @xmath55 such that @xmath58 , where @xmath59 ( the density ) is finite .",
    "let the pressure be @xmath60 .",
    "this pressure does not lead to a too rarified gas ( and is admitted by the knudsen criterion ) .    obviously , the above definition is incorrect because the number of particles is bounded by avogadro s number . as @xmath57",
    ", we have @xmath61 as well . but",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 is not large under the above pressure .",
    "it would be correct to pose the problem , as was said above , neglecting the inverse quantity @xmath64 . in this case",
    ", a mathematically rigorous asymptotics in statistical physics would be obtained .    the transfer of the bose distribution for photons to gas in the form of the bose ",
    "einstein distribution is incorrect . since @xmath65 , where @xmath66 stands for the number of particles at the energy level @xmath67 , can not vary up to infinity ( @xmath68 )",
    ", it follows that the chemical potential @xmath69 can take positive values , which must not be neglected @xcite .",
    "this restriction means that parastatistics must be considered .",
    "the most essential is the note that the distribution given in remark  4 with the property that @xmath7 and @xmath70 are finite permits preserving the parastatistics of the bose ",
    "einstein - type distribution as @xmath0 , and just this property will be used in what follows . the fact that it holds in the classical limit is especially unusual for the physicists ( cf .",
    "remark  1 . ) .",
    "therefore , in addition to references to exact theorems , i also present several other arguments .",
    "for example , the physicists completely accepted the financial considerations presented in  @xcite .    `` a general important property of money bills is that the change of one money bill by another of the same denomination does not play any role .",
    "this property , which can be called `` money do not smell '' , permits uniquely determining the formula for nonlinear addition .",
    "we assume that we want to deposit two copecks into two equivalent banks .",
    "how many possibilities do we have ?",
    "we can deposit both copecks into the first bank , or deposit both copecks into the second bank , or deposit per one copeck in each of the banks .",
    "thus , we have three possibilities .",
    "but if we want to deposit two diamonds , then we have four possibilities , because we can interchange the diamonds . at the same time",
    ", it does not make any sense to interchange the copecks .",
    "the identity property of money bills of the same denomination permits changing the number of versions .",
    "this statistics , just as the statistics of identical bose - particles is called the quantum statistics ( bose - statistics ) , and the statistics of diamonds ( provided that they are not absolutely identical ) is called the classical statistics .",
    "but as we see , the bose - statistics can be applied to money , more precisely , to money bills.''@xcite , p.  5 . and",
    "this is despite the fact that the copecks may have different years of their issue and the money bills have individual numbers .",
    "objectively , they are different , but for our problems , this difference is not essential , because only the quantity of money bills is important for us .",
    "further , the physicists did not protest , when schoenberg used the creation and annihilation operators in classical mechanics  @xcite . and",
    "this is possible only when considering the fock space of identical particles .",
    "we consider one more aspect of this problem in more detail , because the molecular dynamics of classical particles is nowadays commonly used .",
    "in the well - known textbook @xcite by landau and lifshits , the authors explain the identity principle for particles as follows : `` in classical mechanics , identical particles ( such as electrons ) do not lose their ` identity ' despite the identity of their physical properties .",
    "namely , we can visualize the particles constituting a given physical system at some instant of time as ` numbered ' and then observe the motion of each of them along its trajectory ; hence , at any instant of time , the particles can be identified . ... in quantum mechanics , it is not possible , in principle , to observe each of the identical particles and thus distinguish them .",
    "we can say that , in quantum mechanics , identical particles completely lose their ` identity ' ''  ( p.  252 ) .",
    "there are similar explanations of the identity principle for particles in other textbooks as well .",
    "but , as a matter of fact , if the initial data for the cauchy problem does not possess a symmetry property , then the situation in quantum mechanics does not differ from that in classical mechanics .",
    "indeed , suppose that the hamiltonian function @xmath71 is symmetric with respect to permutation of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 denote the self - adjoint operator in the space @xmath76 corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath77 ( weyl of jordan quantized ) .    consider the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath78 satisfying the initial conditions @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and we can assume that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is a bell - shaped function vanishing outside a neighborhood of the point @xmath84 , and the neighborhoods are small so that these functions do not intersect .",
    "returning in time to the initial point , we can number all the bell - shaped functions .",
    "but in the projection on the real space @xmath85 containing all  @xmath86 particles , the experimenter can not distinguish them without taking into account the full deterministic process with respect to time from zero to the given  @xmath87 .",
    "similarly , in classical mechanics , of two point particles have intersected and the experimenter has no knowledge of their velocities ( instant photo ) , then he also can not distinguish them .",
    "he must know their original velocities , i.e. , use slow - motion filming .",
    "this means that he has to look into their `` past '' .",
    "but if the experimenter must determine which of the original particles with a prescribed velocity arrived at the given point , then he must observe the whole process , up to the point @xmath88 .",
    "finally , let us consider the particle identity philosophically .    in statistical calculations of the number of inhabitants in a town , the permutation between a child and an old man does not change the total number of inhabitants .",
    "hence , from the point of view of the statistics of the given calculation , they are indistinguishable . from the point of view of the experimenters who observes the molecules of a homogeneous gas using an atomic microscope , they are indistinguishable .",
    "he counts the number of molecules ( monomers ) and , for example , of dimers in a given volume .",
    "dimers constitute 7% in the total volume of gas ( according to m.  h.  kalos ) .",
    "this means that the experimenter does not distinguish individual monomers , as well as dimers , from one another and counts their separate numbers .",
    "his answer does not depend on the method of numbering the molecules .",
    "these obvious considerations are given for the benefit of those physicists who relate the fact that quantum particles are indistinguishable with the impossibility of knowing the world .",
    "i do not intend to argue with this philosophical fact , but wish to dwell only on mathematics and statistics and distributions related to the number of objects .",
    "let us turn to the boltzmann statistics , as is described in `` mathematical encyclopedia '' @xcite . in his article on the boltzmann statistics , d.  zubarev , the well - known specialist in mathematical physics and the closest disciple of n.  n.  bogolyubov , writes that , in boltzmann statistics , `` particles ... are distinguishable '' .",
    "however , a few lines below , zubarev states that `` in the calculation of statistical weight , one takes into account the fact that the permutation of identical particles does not change the state , and hence the phase volume must be decreases by @xmath89 times '' .    of course , it is impossible to simultaneously take into account both remarks .",
    "but they are both needed to solve the gibbs paradox . as i pointed out on numerous occasions , from the mathematical point of view , the gibbs paradox is a counterexample to the maxwell  boltzmann distribution regarded as a statistical distribution for a gas in which the molecules can not be turned back , but not a counterexample to a dynamical distribution  @xcite .",
    "as for the famous discussion between boltzmann and some mathematicians  @xcite , of course , if the particles of the gas are distinguishable and can be numbered , then they can also be mentally turned back and returned to a state close to their initial state , as the poincare theorem states .    as an example we consider the last source of errors , because the computer has a finite memory",
    "how is the number of particles related to the computer error and the computer s ability to recover their initial data ?    by way of example",
    ", we consider a set of unnumbered billiard balls of unit mass and the same color .",
    "first , consider one billiard ball and launch it from some ( arbitrary ) point with velocity not exceeding a certain sufficiently large value  @xmath90 , i.e. , with energy not exceeding  @xmath91 .",
    "however , since the computer has certain accuracy , it follows that the energy of the ball will take a finite integer number , @xmath92 , of values in the interval of energies @xmath93 $ ] : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 corresponds to this accuracy .",
    "thus , we obtain a spectrum of energy values which can be regarded as a self - adjoint diagonal matrix of order  @xmath92,where @xmath97 . by assigning such a discrete set of energies to a ball",
    ", we obtain the wave  particle correspondence in classical mechanics , because the resulting matrix is unitary equivalent to any operator @xmath98 with such a spectrum in a hilbert space  @xmath99 .",
    "how many balls must be launched so that the computer will be unable to determine their initial data ?    the spectrum corresponding to  @xmath7 balls is obtained by considering the tensor product of  @xmath7 hilbert spaces : @xmath100 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this operator have the form @xmath101 if we only consider the eigenvalues symmetric with respect to the permutation of the particles of this operator , which corresponds to the identity of the balls , then the eigenvalue @xmath102 is of multiplicity equal to the number of all possible variants of the solution of the problem @xmath103    since the initial set of energies is `` without preferences , ''",
    "i.e. , is in general position , then all the multiplicities corresponding to   are equiprobable . the computer calculation time is related to the computer accuracy  @xmath96 with respect to energy .",
    "the problem is how to determined  @xmath7 for which , at a particular instant of time , the computer can not recover the initial data in view of the inaccuracy of the classical pattern or that of the quantum mechanical pattern ( which is more accurate , but more cumbersome ) ; the latter pattern , in turn , is not accurately described by an interaction of lennard - jones type .",
    "thus , we can draw the following conclusion .",
    "the initial data in the classical and quantum mechanical problems are forgotten because of external noise . as a result ,",
    "the problem is reduced to the distribution @xmath104 . in this problem",
    ", we assume _ a priori _ that the initial data are forgotten and , therefore , so is the numbering of classical particles .",
    "although the textbook  @xcite erroneously interprets the difference between the quantum mechanical pattern and the classical one , it , nevertheless , gives a valid interpretation of the numbering of identical balls .",
    "therefore , we can take symmetric eigenfunctions for  @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , it only remains to obtain the distribution of the number of particles  @xmath66 using relations  .",
    "if @xmath106 , then   can be expressed as @xmath107 these relations coincide with those in the classical number - theoretic problem under the condition that @xmath108 is integer , which , of course , is of no importance in the asymptotics as @xmath109 and @xmath57 .",
    "thus , since the noise component has prevented us to recover the initial data and the number of particles @xmath7 is preserved as well as the total energy  @xmath110 , without given any preference to any versions from  , we assume all the variants satisfying the relation @xmath111 to be equiprobable .    in this approach , we can also take into account the collision of billiard balls , the initial energy of all balls can only decrease due to friction and the passage of kinetic energy into thermal energy during collisions .",
    "the numb er of balls will remain the same and the total energy will not exceed the initial energy  @xmath110 .    this approach can also be applied to turbulence if we consider such a significant invariant as the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "note another highly important difference between the statistical and dynamical approaches .",
    "if the experimenter presents some data , then , as a rule , this means that he has carried out many experiments and presented the data consistent with all the experiments .",
    "in addition , these data can be verified by other experimenters and only after that they will be universally accepted .",
    "this means that all the variants of relations   are , in a sense , equiprobable .",
    "if inequality   is replaced by the corresponding equality , then we obtain the well - known microcanonical distribution . but as shown in  @xcite , the final results for the inequality and the equality coincide .",
    "therefore , we have finally derived the well - known microcanonical distribution for the number of particles , whose permutation does not affect the counting result .",
    "thus the notion of different ( distinguishable ) particles is incorrect if one speaks about their density . from the point of view of density of the set of objects under consideration , these objects are indistinguishable ,",
    "namely , any transportation of these objects does not influence the density .",
    "therefore , one must not apply the boltzmann distribution in thermodynamics .",
    "since  @xmath7 is a large number and the value @xmath70 is not large , one must use parastatistics ( see @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and formula   below ) .",
    "so we arrived at some inconsistencies in the main laws of thermodynamics and statistical physics .",
    "one of the most important distinctions between them is that there is a positive chemical potential in the distribution for the `` bose gas '' of finitely many particles  @xmath7 .",
    "of course , this is related to the famous notion of bose condensate .",
    "as was shown in  @xcite , there exists a degeneracy temperature such that for @xmath112 the number of particles is maximal , @xmath113 , and if @xmath114 , then @xmath115 of particles get into the bose condensate with energy zero ( or minimal ) .",
    "we present an example of such a condensate in number theory .    for this , we consider koroviev ",
    "fagot s trick , described by m.  a.  bulgakov in the novel `` master and margarita '' , which was already discussed in our preceding papers  @xcite . in a variety show , he scattered @xmath86 money bills of 1 tchervonets denomination among @xmath3 spectators .",
    "we assume that all versions of scattering of @xmath86 money bills over  @xmath3 spectators are equiprobable ( the chaotic condition ) .",
    "this is equivalent to decomposition of an integer  @xmath86 into  @xmath3 terms .",
    "the logarithm of the number of possible versions @xmath116 is the entropy .",
    "we consider two examples related to fagot trick .",
    "let @xmath86 money bills be distributed over @xmath117 spectators , where @xmath117 is such that @xmath118 ( clearly , for @xmath119 and @xmath120 , the number of versions is equal to  @xmath121 , and hence such a supremum exists . ) then , with a larger probability , @xmath117 spectators obtain a quantity of money bills .",
    "if for @xmath122 , the number of versions and hence the entropy decrease , then the entropy is maximal when the remaining spectators do not get any bill , i.e. , they get into the bose condensate .",
    "now we assume that the number of spectators is @xmath123 .",
    "then , roughly speaking , @xmath117 ( i.e. , a half ) spectators obtain several money bills , and @xmath117 spectators do not obtain anything . since @xmath117 spectators with a larger probability ( see  @xcite ) obtain zero of money bills , the number of versions of the distribution of money bills over spectators is also equal to @xmath124 .",
    "we couple the spectators under the following condition : if somebody in a pair does not obtain any money bill , then the sum obtained by the other is divided , for example , in half .",
    "therefore , we now have @xmath117 pairs , and the number of all versions is equal to the number of versions in the first example .",
    "therefore , the kolmogorov complexity ( entropy ) in both examples is the same and equal to @xmath125 , where @xmath117 is the number of pairs .",
    "thus either case is equiprobable , i.e. it there were @xmath123 spectators , then @xmath117 of them would not get anything and if the spectators coupled , then all the pairs would obtain some money bills , but the number of versions of the distribution still remains equal to @xmath124 , and none of the examples can be preferred .",
    "both of the realizations is equiprobable . in other words",
    ", it may be that the spectators coupled , and it may be that @xmath117 spectators remain without any money bills .    if we speak about the social economic efficiency , then it would be better if the spectators coupled .",
    "thus , it is a priori unknown what is the results of the phase transition of an ideal bose gas into condensate : pairs of particles or , as was previously assumed in physics , particles at the ground level .",
    "if we consider the repulsing potential , as n.  n.  bogolyubov did in his famous work in 1947 , then this problem remains unsolved .",
    "but if we consider the lennard ",
    "jones potential , then , as the author showed in  @xcite , there are arising pairs . in this case ,",
    "one significantly uses the pontryagin  andronov ",
    "vitt theorem  @xcite , which implies that the time of stay of a particle inside the barrier , which exists in the case of the lennard ",
    "jones potential , depends on the noise level or the gas temperature .",
    "it is clear that the transition into the condensate state must occur with a larger probability , which a mathematician must estimate .",
    "these estimates were first performed in  @xcite .",
    "if some particles form pairs ( dimers ) , then the free particles ( monomers ) occur in the fractal situation .",
    "this fractal dimension can in general be counted by the hausdorff formula .    as is known , as the temperature increases , the number of dimers decreases , and hence the fractal dimension increases . and this means that one more pair of quantities must be introduced in thermodynamics : the extensive ( dimension ) quantity and the intensive quantity corresponding to it , which we call the `` press '' .",
    "this can be done rather easily , because the thermodynamical potential @xmath126 is known for parastatistics of any dimension .",
    "its derivative with respect to the dimension is just the desired intensive quantity  @xcite .        as for the problem shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , it is clear that , for @xmath127 , there exist only monomers , and between @xmath128 and @xmath129 , i.e. , between the barrier bottom and height , there exist both monomers and dimers . hence the fractal dimension between @xmath128 and @xmath129 is less than  @xmath130 .",
    "let us consider the following natural variation of the notion of bose condensate for the classical parastatistical gas .",
    "since the parastatistical condensate results in the appearance of pairs ( dimers ) , the number of free degrees of freedom increases , and hence one can speak not about the energy disappearance in the parastatistical condensate but about the energy conservation by means of its redistribution .",
    "but if dimers , i.e. , molecule associations , appear , then rotational and oscillatory components are added .",
    "this decreases the total energy of monomers , and hence @xmath113 also decreases , which started an avalanche - like process until ( with a larger probability ) the translational energy of monomers disappears .",
    "and hence there is a phase transition in the energy redistribution and , naturally , a phase transition in the fractal dimension , which thus decreases .",
    "we must not seek a phase transition of such a type in the domain , where the gas  liquid transition occurs according to the van der waals ",
    "maxwell scheme , the scheme accepted by both the specialists in thermodynamics and the specialists in molecular physics of the old school .",
    "but the specialists in modern mathematical physics prefer to use the theory of percolation and renorm - group , as well as the possibilities due to computer computations .      both in the theory of percolation and in the theory of nucleation , as well as in the van der waals ",
    "maxwell theory , an important role is played by the surface tension , treated as an additional energy .",
    "if this additional component is not considered , then the just described purely mathematical approach and the phase transition must be sought in the domain of critical temperature , i.e. , in the domain , where the surface tension disappears .",
    "this structure , in which gas and liquid are indistinguishable , is called fluids from the time of alchemists .",
    "just as in remark  2 , we can write the microcanonical distribution , but under the condition that permutations in @xmath66 are forbidden .",
    "as a result , we obtain a parastatistical distribution that is very close to the bose distribution .      as a rule , in physics in this case ,",
    "the correct conditions of the sommerfeld radiation are posed , which turn the problem into a not self - adjoint problem .",
    "if we go out into the complex domain through the cut , then it is reduced to the problem of finding regge - type poles for a self - adjoint problem .",
    "the mathematicians considered , as an example , a potential on a finite interval in the half - plane for the one - dimensional wave equation with a finite well and with the radiation conditions on the boundary of the finite domain ( the domain where the potential takes the values @xmath131 $ ] ) .",
    "let @xmath132 be the value of @xmath133 on the barrier maximum .",
    "but the `` eigenfunctions '' corresponding to the regge poles ( the poled of the resolvent continued through the cut into the complex domain ) increase exponentially as @xmath134 . but",
    "the regge `` eigenfunctions '' for which the real parts of the poles are close to the quasilevels of the well are sufficiently large in the domain of the well .",
    "we prove that the solution of the cauchy problem for the wave equation whose initial conditions are consistent with the radiation conditions ( i.e. , the derivative with respect to  @xmath87 depends on the initial function for @xmath88 ) tends to zero at each point  @xmath133 of the support of the finite potential .      in the problem under study , there is addition energy equal to the average energy @xmath136 ( where @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath137 is the temperature ) multiplied by the number of particles  @xmath7 ( another large parameter ) .",
    "thus , we must compare the quantity @xmath138 with @xmath139 .",
    "in fact , there is one more dissipation in gas , namely , the viscosity , which also can not be neglected in mathematical computations and which ensures that the initial problem is not self - adjoint ( the parameter corresponding to friction ) .",
    "the problem of determining the limit situation becomes significantly simpler in the language of nonstandard analysis .",
    "the rigorous theorems even in the case of this simplification are very c cumbersome .",
    "we present the main ideas .    in the semiclassical limit",
    ", one can assume that the well up to the barrier maximum and the domain from this point to the boundary condition are in no way related to each other .",
    "only at the point @xmath18 equal to the barrier maximum in infinite time , the classical particle can `` creep '' over the barrier ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the mathematicians consider the one - dimensional wave equation @xmath140 in the half - space @xmath141 , @xmath142 for @xmath143 .",

    "now we consider the contrary problem , i.e. , the `` irradiation '' problem .",
    "in other words , we pose conditions that are complex conjugate to the sommerfeld conditions .",
    "this problem does not always has solutions .",
    "the well is being filled until @xmath157 if @xmath158 then the solutions do not exist , because the part @xmath159\\ ] ] reflects from the point @xmath160 , and the `` irradiation '' condition is not satisfied .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to the following one .",
    "assume that a negatively charged body is `` irradiated '' by positive ions . then after a certain number of ions sticks to the body ( fills the well ) and neutralizes it , the other freely flying ions reflect from the body and the `` irradiation '' process stops .",
    "the conditions dual to the sommerfeld condition are not satisfied any more , because the radiation process originates simultaneously . in our case ,",
    "the role of attracting charges is played by regge poles .",
    "the sommerfeld conditions are a specific case of the blackbody condition .",
    "this problem was posed even by frank and von mises in their survey as one of fundamental problems .",
    "the feynman integral does not contain any measure , because it is impossible to pose the boundary conditions for the feynman tube : the feynman tube boundary is a black body . by definition ,",
    "if the trajectory enters this boundary , it should not be considered any more ,    in the wiener integral of tunes , this is also a black body , but compared with the wave problem , the black body in the diffusion problem is understood as a situation in which the particles stick to the wall , and this means the zero boundary conditions for the heat conduction equation .",
    "after the transition to @xmath46-representations , as was shown in our work with a.  m.  chebotarev  @xcite , the zero boundary conditions give the feynman tube in the @xmath46-representation , and it is possible to determine the measure for the finite potential .    the temporary energy capture in the laser illumination and its subsequent transformation into a directed beam also characterize the absorption - type trap of `` irradiation '' that further turns into radiation .",
    "probably , the problem of black holes in astronomy is a problem of the same type . in the one - dimensional case , on a finite interval",
    ", the modern mathematical apparats can solve this problem completely . in this case , if @xmath161 , where @xmath7 is the number of particles , then with a large probability ) one can determine the number of particles inside the well and the number of particles outside it . by the way , this also readily follows from the concept of microcanonical distribution .",
    "indeed , the multiplicity ( or the `` cell '' as it is called in  @xcite ) of the eigenvalue @xmath162 is different inside and outside the well : it depends on the density of eigenvalues as @xmath0 on a small interval @xmath163 . obviously , this quantity is proportional to the width of each well on the interval @xmath147 $ ] , i.e. , to the length of @xmath164 $ ] and @xmath165 $ ] .",

    ", the author has rigorously proved that there exists a parastatistical condensate similar to the bose condensate in the one - dimensional and two - dimensional cases as well as in the case of fractal dimension greater than zero .",
    "this holds not only for identical objects ( particles ) , but for objects ( particles ) that are assumed indistinguishable , such as those in the calculation of the `` number '' of teenagers , the `` number '' of women , the `` number '' of men , the `` number '' of money bills of one denomination , the `` number '' of cites with population of over 1000 people , etc .",
    "this same applies when we speak about density . in the last case ,",
    "the difference with thermodynamics is in only that there can be no finite thermodynamic limit ( as stated in  @xcite ) , i.e. , the ratio @xmath174 , where @xmath7 is the number of objects , and  @xmath47 is their volume , area , or length , may tend to infinity .",
    "in addition , the author proved that the parastatistical condensate , which is close to the bose ",

    "since in the three - dimensional case ( the fractal dimension is  @xmath130 ) @xmath339 for @xmath343 is attained at the point @xmath344 , and above the point @xmath314 , the dimensions begin to increase up to the three - dimensional , i.e. , if there are no dimers at the boyle and higher temperatures , then , according to the above argument , the addition to the original number of particles  monomers is equal to @xmath345 with a certain constant , which we determine by the condition : for @xmath343 , the dimension must be equal to  @xmath130 , i.e. , @xmath346 .",
    "hence @xmath347 for the lennard - jones type potential  .",
    "we find @xmath267 from the condition @xmath348 now , in our case , @xmath267 varies from @xmath349 to @xmath350 and depends on  @xmath128 , i.e , on @xmath351 , where @xmath352 . but @xmath353 where @xmath354 is determined by the isochore @xmath355 continued above the point @xmath314 .",
    "now we have determined the dependence @xmath239 for the new isochore whose dimension varies from  @xmath236 to  @xmath130 and the volume remains unchanged .",
    "the quantity @xmath356 , as a function of temperature , increases almost exponentially approaching the boyle temperature . to retain this fast increasing number of monomers in the volume  @xmath235 ,",
    "it is necessary to increase the pressure at the same rate .",
    "therefore , the pressure increases much faster than  @xmath342 , and this results in elongation of the isochore for @xmath357 .",
    "the value of  @xmath342 increases by  @xmath358 units and attains @xmath359 , while the pressure increases more than twice .",
    "the other isochores are similar to those constructed above , because their abscissas and ordinates increase and decreases by the same factors .",
    "the angle at which they intersect the critical isotherm @xmath241 was calculated .",
    "to each point in the family of isochores there corresponds a pair of points @xmath244 and  @xmath255 .",
    "hence , for a given @xmath47 , the temperature  @xmath137 is determined and the locus of points corresponding to the isotherm @xmath253 is constructed .",
    "in conclusion , i note that the rigorous proof of all the above statements is very cumbersome .",
    "it is based on the use of the correction to variations in the self - consistent field in the scattering problem and the complex germ method ( in topology , the term `` maslov gerbe '' is used , in mathematical physics , the term `` complex germ '' ) , as well as the ultrasecond quantization , where the operators of couple creation are used .      the author wishes to express his deep gratitude to a.  r.  khokhlov , a.  a.  kulikovskii , a.  i.  osipov , i.  v.  melikhov , l.  r.  fokin , yu .",
