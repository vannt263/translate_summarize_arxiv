    "numerous astronomical observations have led to the conclusion that most of the matter in the universe is invisible , exotic , and nonrelativistic dark matter  @xcite . however , in spite of a considerable amount of experimental effort , the nature of the dark matter remains unknown . weakly interacting massive particles  ( wimps )",
    "are one of the most attractive candidates for dark matter particles  @xcite . in supersymmetric models for beyond the standard model physics ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a natural candidate for wimp - type dark matter .",
    "a number of experiments have made direct searches for a wimp component of our galaxy by looking for evidence for wimp - nucleus scattering by detecting the recoiling nucleus in ultra - sensitive low - background detectors  @xcite .",
    "the dama experiment searches for an annual modulation in the detection rate of nuclear recoils in an array of ultra - low - background nai(tl ) crystals caused by the earth s orbital motion through our galaxy s dark - matter halo  @xcite .",
    "this experiment , which has been operating for over 15 years , has consistently reported a positive signal for an annual modulation with a phase that is consistent with expectations for motion of the earth relative to the galactic rest frame .",
    "the statistical significance of the dama annual modulation signal has now reacehed @xmath1 .",
    "other experiments , including cogent  @xcite , cresst  @xcite , and cdms  @xcite , have also reported signals that could be interpreted as being possibly due to wimp interactions .",
    "however , these signals have marginal significance at the < 3@xmath0 confidence level and some inconsistencies with null results using similar detectors that were already reported  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these marginal signals have motivated the same experimental groups and , in some cases , independent groups to devise experiments to check these signals using similar techniques but with higher sensitivity .",
    "in contrast , to date , no independent verification of the dama signal in an experiment using the same technique has been done .",
    "the dama signal , in particular its interpretation as being due to wimp - nucleus scattering , has been the subject of a continuing debate that started with the first dama report 15 years ago .",
    "this is because the wimp - nucleon cross sections inferred from the dama modulation are in conflict with limits from other experiments that directly measure the total rate of nuclear recoils , such as xenon100  @xcite , lux  @xcite , and supercdms  @xcite .",
    "however , room remains for explaining all of these experimental results without conflict in terms of nontrivial systematic differences in detector responses  @xcite and the commonly used astronomical model for the wimp distribution  @xcite .",
    "an unambiguous verification of the dama signal by an independent experiment using similar nai(tl ) crystals is mandatory .",
    "reproducing the dama measurement requires the independent development of ultra - low - background nai(tl ) crystals .",
    "this is because the crystal - growing company that supplied the dama nai(tl ) crystals will not produce the same crystals for other experimental groups .",
    "recently , the anais group has been developing ultra - low - background nai(tl ) crystals with the goal of reproducing the dama result  @xcite and the dm - ice group reports background measurements of nai(tl ) crystals  @xcite .",
    "however , to date , no experimental group has produced nai(tl ) crystals with background levels at or below than those used in the dama experiment .    the korea invisible mass search ( kims ) collaboration has been performing direct wimp searches using ultra - low - background csi(tl ) crystal detectors , which are similar experimental devices to the nai(tl ) crystals used in the dama experiment .",
    "this implementation required extensive research and development aimed at identifying and reducing internal backgrounds in the csi crystals  @xcite .",
    "null results from kims reject wimp - iodine nuclei interactions as the source of the dama signal with very little model dependence  @xcite .",
    "however , because the dama results can be interpreted as being primarily due to wimp - sodium nuclei interactions , which , for example , would be the case for low - mass wimps , it remains necessary to confirm the dama observations with nai(tl ) crystal detectors .",
    "this motivated a program to develop ultra - low - background nai(tl ) crystal detectors with lower background levels and and higher light yields ( and , thus , a lower energy threshold ) than those of the dama experiment in order to identify unambiguously the origin of the dama modulation signature .",
    "to evaluate the nai(tl ) crystals , we use the experimental setup that was used for the kims csi(tl ) detector measurements at the yangyang underground laboratory ( y2l ) , which has a 700  m earth overburden ( 2400  m water equivalent ) . this includes a 12-module array of csi(tl ) detectors ( total mass of 103.4  kg ) inside a shield that consists , from inside out , of 10  cm of copper , 5  cm of polyethylene , 15  cm of lead , and 30  cm of liquid - scintillator - loaded mineral oil to stop external neutrons , gamma rays , and veto cosmic ray muons .",
    "each detection module consists of a low - background csi(tl ) crystal ( @xmath2 ) with a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) mounted at each end .",
    "two nai(tl ) crystals were mounted inside the csi(tl ) detector array as shown in fig .",
    "[ experimentalsetup ] . in november 2013 , we installed the first nai(tl ) crystal , nai-001 , in the csi array ; the second nai(tl ) crystal , nai-002 , was added in february 2014 , soon after that crystal was delivered and assembled .",
    "the two nai(tl ) crystals were produced by the alpha spectra company .",
    "the crystals were grown from nai powder that was not of the highest attainable purity ; the initial purification was carried out by alpha spectra .",
    "the crystals have a cylindrical shape and were cut from a 32  inch ingot that was grown by the kyropoulos method .",
    "the detailed sizes of the crystals are listed in table  [ crystalspec ] .",
    "after the crystal surfaces were polished they were wrapped with a teflon reflector and inserted into an oxigen - free electronic  ( ofe ) copper cylinder and encapsulated in a nitrogen gas environment .",
    "there is a 12.7-mm - thick quartz - plate window at each end of the cylinder , with optical grease between the crystal and the quartz windows .",
    "a 3@xmath3 pmt is mounted at each end of the cylinder .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the dama experiment has been consistently showing a significant annual modulation with two different experimental arrangements that has persisted over the past 15 years . to check these results",
    ", it is necessary to use the same target material and preferable to have a lower threshold and reduced background levels . achieving a software energy threshold of 1",
    "kev seems feasible because of the high crystal light output and the high quantum efficiency of the new pmts .",
    "background levels can be significantly improved from the current measured background level of @xmath43  counts / kev / kg / day  ( at 6  kev ) by growing the crystals from purer nai powder and in a rn - free environment . because the main internal backgrounds are due to  and , we are attempting to reduce these contaminations below the background level of 0.2  counts / kev / kg / day for each source , and the prospects of starting with purer powder from sigma aldrich are promising .",
    "in addition to the internal backgrounds , the external backgrounds need to be controlled well below 0.5  counts / kev / kg / day .",
    "low - background , metal - housed pmts with lower radioactivity specifications are commercially available and it is possible to use high efficiency sba photocathodes with these tubes .",
    "we are working closely with the hamamatsu company to develop a pmt that is better suited for a low - background nai(tl ) crystal detector module .",
    "further , we expect a significant reduction in the internal or external backgrounds by the immersion of the nai(tl ) crystal array inside a liquid scintillator box that provides an active veto capability .",
    "a naive simulation shows that @xmath470% of the pmt - initiated backgrounds below 10 kev can be vetoed .",
    "a performance test with a single nai crystal is in progress .",
    "we tested the performance of two large nai(tl ) crystals as part of a program to develop ultra - low - background nai crystals for wimp searches .",
    "we developed selection requirements that are effective for reducing pmt - noise induced background signals .",
    "based on this effort , we achieved a background level of @xmath43  counts / kev / kg / day at 6  kev and a < 2  kev energy threshold .",
    "a number of efforts are being pursued that are aimed at further reduction of these backgrounds .",
    "the successful development of ultra - low - background and low - energy - threshold nai crystals with much reduced pmt background will guarantee a definitive and unambiguous test of the dama experiment s annual modulation signal .",
    "we thank the korea hydro and nuclear power ( khnp ) company for providing the underground laboratory space at yangyang .",
