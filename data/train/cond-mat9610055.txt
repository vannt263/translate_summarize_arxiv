    "fermionic quantum spin glasses form a part of the overlap regime of interacting disordered fermion systems and spin glasses .",
    "understanding such systems with frustrated or with general random interactions between fermionic spins touches many currently active research fields .",
    "the wellknown transverse field ising spin glass can also be represented as a pseudofermionic quantum spin glass with imaginary chemical potential and thus be treated analogously to the ones discussed here which involve real fermion spins .",
    "one of the attractive features of fermionic spin glasses is the connection of spin and charge degrees of freedom . even in a strongly localized ising limit ( with all",
    "spin and charge variables commuting ) quantum statistics remains indispensable , since it governs the relative occupation of magnetic and nonmagnetic states .",
    "this provides a link between spin and charge correlations , exerting a major influence on magnetic phase diagrams for example .",
    "nonanalytic interplay is observed in the simplest fermionic spin glass , the sk  model extended to a four  state  per  site fermionic space ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this phenomenon occurs at a thermal tricritical point , separating continuous spin glass transitions around half  filling from discontinuous regimes at either strong or weak filling .",
    "this structure of the phase diagram is compared with a similar one of classical spin 1 models including the clean beg  model .",
    "furthermore , model definitions on fermionic space generate a large set of correlation functions which display ubiquitous quantum dynamics of these models on the fermionic level , ie beyond the one seen in spin and charge  correlations and caused by electronic transport .",
    "the fermionic green s function and its density of states content is one of those quantities which probe the commutation properties of single fermion operators with the hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath1 shows such quantum  dynamics .",
    "moreover , correlations of the statistical density of states fluctuations turn out to be related to the spin glass order parameter , which introduces parisi replica symmetry breaking into the charge sector . +",
    "in contrast to standard spin glass models like sk or transverse field models , the models of interacting true fermion spins are naturally described in the grand canonical ensemble . statistically fluctuating spin interactions",
    "leave only the choice between nonrandom local fermion concentration or nonrandom chemical potential . in any case",
    "however an effective spin dilution due to thermal redistribution among magnetic and nonmagnetic states is controlled by either @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "this form of thermal spin dilution comprises at a special point the case of nonanalytically communicating charge and spin  fluctuations .",
    "the simplest model displaying this type of behavior is the ising spin lass on a fermionic space ( @xmath1 ) with four states per site , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath4 with spins @xmath5 , particle number operator @xmath6 and gaussian distributed exchange integrals @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the fermionic field operators obey the usual commutator relations @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "expressing the partition function with the help of grassman integrals the disorder averaging of the free energy is performed by means of the replica trick @xmath10_{av}= [ \\log z]_{av}=\\lim_{n \\to 0}\\frac{1}{n } ( 1-[\\pi_{\\alpha = 1}^n z^{\\alpha}]_{av})$ ] . as a guide to the global phase diagram we study an exactly solvable infinite range version of the model but the formulae obtained in this subsection may equally well be considered as saddle point approximation for an interaction with finite range .",

    "the edwards - anderson order parameter @xmath14 describes the freezing of spins in the spin glass phase and is given by the plateau height @xmath15 of the order parameter function , whereas the replica diagonal @xmath16_{av}$ ] is related to the average filling factor @xmath17_{av } = \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_i [ n_i]_{av } $ ] by @xmath17_{av } = 1 + \\tanh(\\beta \\mu)(1 - \\tilde{q})$ ] .",
    "the last relation is exact even in the case of replica symmetry breaking . to obtain information about the phase diagram a replica symmetric approximation is sufficient , though .",
    "the symmetric saddle  point solutions are @xmath18}{{\\cal c}^{2}_{\\mu}(z)}$ ] and @xmath19 } { { \\cal c}_{\\mu}(z ) } $ ] with @xmath20 +    \\cosh(\\beta\\mu)\\exp[-1/2\\beta^2(\\tilde{q}- q)]$ ] .",
    "phase transitions are signalized by vanishing masses of the order parameter propagators which in the saddle point formalism are given by second derivatives of the free energy .",
    "hence a positive mass for @xmath13 and a negative one for @xmath21 guarantees stability .",
    "a similar system of coupled stability conditions was found for the beg - model @xcite and for a sk - model with crystal field @xcite . analyzing the stability limits one obtains curves of critical spin and charge fluctuations , respectively :    @xmath22 \\label{ten}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath23 \\label{eleven}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the two curves have a common tangent point at @xmath24=0.961056 , t_{c3}=1/3 $ ] . for smaller values of the chemical potential",
    "the paramagnetic solution becomes unstable to spin fluctuations first , at the common tangent point both types of fluctuations become critical simultaneously and tricritical behaviour results .",

    "however , if g is of order @xmath37 or larger the solution becomes to leading order @xmath38 and thus displays a nonanalytical dependence on temperature and / or chemical potential .",
    "this type of crossover can also be seen from the scaling form of the free energy @xmath39 which allows for the identification of the specific heat exponent @xmath40 and the crossover exponent @xmath41 .",
    "the crossover function @xmath42 is regular for small x and has the asymptotic form @xmath43regular corrections@xmath44 . in the tricritical region",
    "the leading singularity in the free energy is given by @xmath45 .",

    "we find @xmath50 which yields the tricritical order parameter exponent @xmath51 and suggests that @xmath21 and @xmath52 act as order parameters simultaneously . from the fluctuation lagrangian ( see section 3 ) one reads off mass squared proportional to @xmath37 and hence @xmath53 .",
    "we derived a fluctuation theory for the tricritical and finite range @xmath1 ; for @xmath54 a lagrangian of the same structure is obtained for models including transport mechanism by integrating out dynamical degrees of freedom @xmath55 , } \\label{eighteen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the bare coefficients at tricriticality .",

    "the @xmath60coupling is renormalization group generated as in the metallic quantum spin glass , its effects will be discussed in a subsequent section .    inserting the parisi ansatz for replica symmetrie breaking in the lagrangian ( [ eighteen ] ) the expansion of the replica symmetry broken saddle point free energy around the tricritical point reads @xmath61 + j\\{(\\frac{3}{2}r_g g - r_{\\tau}\\tau^2)\\delta\\tilde{q}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{3}{2}\\tau[(\\delta\\tilde{q})^2 -\\int^{1}_{0}dxq^2(x ) ] -\\frac{3}{2 } [ \\int^{1}_{0}dx[xq^3(x)+3q(x)\\int^{x}_{0}dyq^2(y)]\\nonumber\\\\ & -&3\\delta\\tilde{q}\\int^{1}_{0}dxq^2(x ) + \\frac{1}{4}(\\delta\\tilde{q})^3]-\\frac{y_4}{4}\\int^{1}_{0}dxq^4(x)\\ } , \\label{seventeen } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here variables and constants",

    " field exponents will be resolved below by the renormalization group analysis of the coupling @xmath63 of the _ finite  range and finite  dimensional @xmath1_.",
    "the fermionic ising spin glass allows for an exact evaluation of the bare fermion propagator @xmath85 at least in the disordered phase ; here @xmath86 denotes the usual effective field and the double average refers to the replica  local and the parisi block decoupling fields .",

    "statistical fluctuations @xmath94 of the density of states are for example observable in @xmath95 . taking parisi symmetry breaking into account , this correlation becomes a function of the parisi parameter x. picking the one with @xmath96 and @xmath97 we obtain the ( zero field ) result @xmath98 this result shows that the fermionic density fluctuations reflect the irreversible magnetic response introduced by the spin glass order .",
    "it is valid for all fillings , one only has to insert the appropriate parisi function and the filling ",
    "dependent value of the spin autocorrelation @xmath99 at the critical point ; this implies that the scaling of the density correlator with @xmath100 is different in the second order regime ( quadratic ) and at the tricritical point ( linear ) , while for the discontinuous regime a one  step rsb is expected .",
    "it is also clear that for models with transport mechanism the calculation of conductance fluctuations is of great interest .",
    "so far we have put aside the question of replica symmetry breaking of fermion propagators : by this we mean the possibility of a nonvanishing propagator between different replicas , ie @xmath101 . in the light of the mezard ",
    "parisi instability of the random field ising model we feel that this preferably would occur as a fluctuation effect , if at all .",
    "similarities between the phase diagrams of the clean beg  model and of the fermionic ising spin glass can be taken as indicative for the fact that rather spin dilution than disorder is the source of the tricritical crossover from continuous to discontinuous phase transitions . while it is complicated to solve 1d fermionic ising spin glasses exactly , the clean fermionic ising chain offers some simple exact solutions . here",
    "we shall provide insight into the role of the chemical potential and moreover generalize known results into the complex @xmath2plane .",
    "lee and yang @xcite derived the distribution of zeroes of the partition function of finite and infinite ising chains within the complex magnetic field plane .",

    "the complementary role of complex magnetic field and complex chemical potential can nicely be seen by recalling the exact solution for the 2d ising model @xmath131 .",

    "the field theory of such a qpt    shows surprising similarities with the thermal tricritical theory , above all the simultaneous occurence of critical charge and spin fluctuations @xcite .",

    "dependent fluctuations are treated on an equal footing with spatial fluctuations @xcite . while for the lagrangian ( [ seventeen ] ) it was sufficient to consider only the @xmath171 - component of the q - fields , in the quantum case all low energy fields must be kept as they are coupled via the quantum mechanical interaction @xmath172 .",
    "however , the value @xmath173 of the dynamical critical exponent renders the u - coupling dangerously irrelevant and allows for a perturbative mapping of the critical theory on a classical problem , the pseudo - yang - lee edge singularity .",

    "the comparison of the metallic quantum case with the thermal tricritical theory allows one to understand the nature of the strong coupling rg fixed point : whereas the spin fluctuations in the thermal second order regime are governed by a perturbatively accessible fixed point , the tcp and the quantum case are charcterized by the combination of charge and spin fluctuations and a corresponding strong coupling problem .",
