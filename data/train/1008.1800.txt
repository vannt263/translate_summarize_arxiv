    "as many as half of nearby galaxies may host liners , nuclei with distinctive low - ionization spectra that may be a distinct form of agn or an extraordinary starburst @xcite .",
    "many of these galaxies also contain intense starbursts in their cores .",
    "these ` composite ' galaxies have agn@xmath3starburst or liner@xmath3starburst nuclear spectra .",
    "how do the starburst and the active nucleus in these galaxies relate to one other ?",
    "does the agn trigger the starburst , or does the starburst pour fuel into the agn ?",
    "these sources are hard to observe ; high extinctions within galactic nuclei means that optical and near - infrared data can be unreliable .",
    "further , to distinguish between all the forms of activity that may occur in the small volume of a composite galaxy core requires high spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "we report here on high spectral resolution mid - infrared [ neii ] observations of ngc 4102 , a local composite galaxy that is close enough that we can potentially resolve structures within the nucleus .",
    "ngc  4102 is an sb galaxy in the ursa major group .",
    "its redshift is 849 @xmath0 , for a hubble distance of 14 mpc ; the best distance from the tully - fisher relation is 17 mpc @xcite , which we use .",
    "it has a 60/100  flux ratio of 0.71 , which is typical of spiral starbursts .",
    "co observations of ngc  4102 @xcite show that its center is rich in molecular gas , with a derived m@xmath4(r@xmath5300 pc)@xmath6 ( corrected to conversion factor @xmath7 and 17  mpc ) and a central star formation rate ( estimated from the nonthermal radio continuum ) of @xmath8",
    ". the optical spectrum of ngc 4102 resembles that of a giant hii region , but it is not a simple pure starburst source because it also contains low - ionization lines typical of a liner @xcite and it has a bright point source nucleus .",
    "near - infrared lines show a blue component at @xmath9 , relative to the galaxy , @xcite , which has been assumed to be a powerful outflow .",
    "it is therefore classed as a composite galaxy that hosts both a starburst and a mildly active nucleus of liner or sy2 type .",
    "ngc  4102 has often been observed in the near and middle infrared and radio , but mostly with relatively low spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "because it is composite , at least two distinct forms of nuclear activity ( starburst and whatever that point nucleus is ) will be blended in observations with worse than @xmath10 resolution .",
    "they have certainly been blended in the spitzer irs spectra , which have pixel sizes comparable to the entire nuclear region and slit sizes even larger .",
    "high spectral resolution can kinematically separate the different components of a galaxy , but the spectral resolution of the spitzer irs was not sufficient to distinguish the blue component or any smaller velocity offsets within the starburst region .",
    "this complex nature of galactic centers demand observations with high spectral and spatial resolution .",
    "we report here on mid - infrared observations with arcsecond spatial and @xmath11 spectral resolution of the central region of ngc 4102 .",
    "the fine - structure line of @xmath12 at @xmath13 m is usually one of the strongest mid - infrared emission lines in hii regions .",
    "[ neii ] is an excellent tracer of the ionized gas in hii regions because it is strong ( stronger even than the infrared hi recombination lines ) , at a wavelength which is little affected by extinction for @xmath14  mag , and has such high critical density ( @xmath15 ) that collisional de - excitation is unlikely to be significant in hii regions .",
    "it is also an excellent kinematic probe ; it is superior to the hi recombination lines for this purpose because the high atomic weight of neon makes the line less broadened by thermal motions .",
    "[ neii ] has been used to trace the kinematics and spatial distribution of ionized gas in galactic hii regions and in starburst galaxies ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein )    we observed [ neii ] in ngc  4102 with texes , the texas echelle crossed echelon spectrograph(@xcite ) on the nasa irtf on mauna kea , on the night of 1 june 2009 .",
    "texes is a sensitive spectrometer for the 525  region , with three resolution modes : these data were obtained in the medium resolution long - slit mode , which gives spectral resolving power @xmath16 .",
    "the slit was @xmath17 and the plate scale @xmath18 per pixel .",
    "the slit , which was oriented ns , was stepped across the galaxy in 1 increments , first west and then back east .",
    "there were no obvious inconsistencies between the two spectra at each position , giving us confidence in the telescope tracking .",
    "at each position the galaxy was nodded 20  along the slit .",
    "the beams were subtracted and the spectra were added together to create a data cube .",
    "velocities quoted are heliocentric .",
    "the total emission of the [ neii ] line at each position is found by collapsing the data cube to produce the map in figure  [ fig : intneii ] .",
    "the spectrum at each point on the sky is shown in figure  [ fig : cube ] , and the average spectrum over the entire emission region is in the upper right corner of figure  [ fig : cube ] .",
    "the rest frequency of [ neii ] is 780.42@xmath19 ( 12.81 , @xcite ) so the line frequency at the nominal velocity of ngc  4102 would be 778.23@xmath19 ( 12.85 ) .",
    "the [ neii ] emission extends over about 450 @xmath0 , fwzi , and is roughly centered on the nominal galactic velocity , although it is difficult to set the baseline because there are strong telluric features at 779.58 and 777.25 @xmath19 , the ends of the range , which cause very strong noise .",
    "the fwhm is @xmath20150 @xmath0 in the strongest position .",
    "we have obtained from the literature and data archives images of ngc 4102 at pa@xmath21 and the 1.6  j - band continuum from hst , and 3.6  cm radio continuum from the vla archival program aw416 .",
    "the radio and pa@xmath21 maps are shown in figure  [ fig : pa.radio ] and are quite different from each other .",
    "the radio shows two strong peaks against a background of extended emission .",
    "the extended emission has no obvious ring structure but is a smooth plateau .",
    "the near - infrared maps have a weak point source at the nucleus and an inclined ring of emission , which is bright on the sw end and weak to the point of incompleteness on the east .",
    "the only alignment of the maps that gets the bright sources to agree is to identify the northern radio source with the galactic nucleus and the southern radio source with the bright sw peak in the near - infrared maps .",
    "this requires a shift of about 1 in each direction , marginally consistent with the quoted astrometrical accuracy of nicmos .",
    "we compare our [ neii ] results to data taken with the sh module of the irs on the spitzer spacecraft , in pid 30745.the positions used for the irs slits agree with the radio maps and the entire radio emission region falls into the slit of the sh module in which the [ neii ] line is observed . if the nominal , unshifted coordinates are used for pa@xmath21 the galactic nuclear region is only half in the sh module slit .",
    "this further justifies the sizable shift we apply to the pa@xmath21 image .",
    "we recover a total flux of [ neii ] by summing the emission over the @xmath22 wavelength and @xmath23 spatial range in which the line was seen . the wavelength window",
    "included in this calculation corresponds to a full velocity extent of only 385  @xmath0 , typical of the velocity ranges in star forming galaxies and excluding the very high velocities associated with agn .",
    "the total emission is @xmath24 , with an estimated error , largely due to the weak and noisy continuum , of @xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to 7.3  jy at the @xmath26 resolution of the irs , in excellent agreement with the total 7.5  jy found for this line by spitzer .",
    "this shows that _ a )  the entire spitzer - observed emission is confined to the inner 5 ( about 2 pixels of the spitzer detector array ) _ , and _",
    "b )  the entire spitzer - observed emission is at low , star - burst like , velocity ; there is no agn contribution to the [ neii ] line . _    total [ neii ] flux depends on the abundance of neon and the fractional abundance of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath12 is created at the relatively low energy of 21.5  ev , and most of the neon in starbursts is in this ionization state .",
    "agn usually create more @xmath27 ; the ratio of [ neii ] to the higher - excitation lines can be used to separate starburst from non - stellar galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "spitzer irs spectra of ngc  4102 show a relatively weak [ neiii ] line of about 0.7  jy , which includes any contribution from the agn .",
    "we conclude that almost all the neon in this region is in the @xmath12 state .",
    "so the observed [ neii ] flux , the observed br@xmath28 flux of @xmath29 @xcite , and the total 3.6  cm flux of 34 mjy in a 3.75 box in the center of the galaxy are consistent with neon abundance of 0.4 solar and @xmath30 mag . ( neon parameters are discussed in * ? ? ?",
    ". this would imply @xmath31 of 0.6 mag and @xmath32 higher by about 0.5 magnitudes than the 2.4 magnitudes found by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is probably because the galactic nucleus is optically thick at the wavelengths they used .",
    "the line ratios would agree with a lower extinction and higher neon abundance if the radio flux contains a significant non - thermal component .",
    "the galactic nucleus , the nature of whose radio emission is unknown , does contribute about 10% of the total 3.6  cm emission and there may be other non - thermal sources in the region .",
    "the near - infrared and radio maps each show a peak at the nucleus and one in the sw .",
    "the sw is stronger than the nucleus in each case , although the contrast is less in the radio than in pa@xmath21 . in the radio map",
    "the sw source looks like an independent feature , perhaps a very bright star cluster , rather than the limb - brightened region of the annular emission its infrared appearance suggests .",
    "the total [ neii ] emission , shown in figure  [ fig : intneii ] , appears to be in a disk or ring with outer diameter about 4.3 , about 300  pc . unlike both the near - infrared and radio , the [ neii ]",
    "does not show the two distinct sources .",
    "the line emission is stronger in the southern part of the galaxy , but unlike the near - infrared the intensity varies smoothly ; this may be the effect of the lower spatial resolution in the mid - ir .",
    "we believe that the ring seen in the near - infrared ring does not appear in the [ neii ] map because the structure is on too small a scale ; the [ neii ] spatial resolution was seeing and diffraction limited to about @xmath33 .    the pa@xmath21 line , [ neii ] line , and 3.6  cm radio continuum all map ionized gas ; why are their distributions so different ?",
    "the disagreement between the [ neii ] and pa@xmath21 distribution probably shows the influence of extinction on the nir image ; extinction at pa@xmath21 is about 10 times higher than that at [ neii ] .",
    "but the extinction at [ neii ] is small , as shown above , so the difference between the mid - infrared and radio images is not likely to be due to obscuration . while the central agn source is presumably dominated by non - thermal emission , the extended 3.6  cm radio emission in the starburst should be mostly thermal and indeed it is extended and it resembles the [ neii ] .",
    "our high - resolution spectra are not well - suited for continuum measurements and we detect the 12.8  continuum only weakly .",
    "we can say , however , that the 12.8  continuum does not resemble the near - infrared continuum ; it is not noticeably stronger in the south , nor is there a strong mid - infrared continuum source associated with the sw radio source .",
    "this probably reflects the range of extinctions , dust abundances and temperatures in the hii regions around the starburst .",
    "the nature of the radio source at ra @xmath34 dec 52  42  39.1 , is not clear .",
    "it is strong at 3.6  cm and does not appear in 6  cm and 20  cm archival maps , which argues that it is mostly thermal .",
    "there is the possibility that the 6 and 20  cm maps do not show the sw source because it is too small and their beams were larger than 1.7 ; this could be confirmed or disproved with high - resolution observations at longer wavelengths . in the meantime , we will adopt the most straightforward conclusion that the sw source is mostly thermal : a bright giant hiiregion in the starburst ring .",
    "then its radio flux at 3.6  cm of 3  mjy requires , for standard assumptions of density and @xmath35 , an ionization of about @xmath36 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath37  equivalent o7 stars \" @xcite in a region no larger than @xmath38 , or around @xmath39 pc .",
    "if the source has a salpeter imf with @xmath40 lower mass cutoff , the total stellar mass would be around @xmath41 , and if the imf extends to lower masses , a kroupa imf would give @xmath42 . if this is a single super star cluster or young globular cluster recently formed in the starburst ring , it is the largest to be observed in a starburst ring @xcite and among the most massive and luminous anywhere in the local universe : it is very similar to the central source of ngc  5253 @xcite , the largest well - studied single embedded star cluster , and within factors of a few of the immense double cluster in the nearby lirg iras 04296 + 2923 @xcite .",
    "this source might , in another setting , be counted as a dwarf galaxy in its own right ; it is as large as many of the tidal dwarfs that form in the debris of strong interactions ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "that the ionized gas in ngc 4102 is rotating may be seen clearly in the spectra of figure  [ fig : cube ] as the line peak shifts from position to position .",
    "a position - velocity diagram of the [ neii ] emission along the major axis of the galaxy is shown in figure  [ fig : pv ] .",
    "it is consistent with rotation , with some evidence for non - circular motion that will be discussed in the next section . in spatial appearance",
    "the [ neii ] could be a disk or a ring .",
    "there are two reasons we think it is more likely to be a ring : 1 ) the near - infrared maps show clear gas depletion in the center , and 2 ) a rotating disk of gas would reach much higher velocities at small radii ( although possibly over an undetectably small area ) . so the [ neii ] observations indicate that ngc  4102 hosts a rotating nuclear starburst ring .",
    "the velocity gradient is @xmath43 , or @xmath44 , over the inner 3or 200 pc diameter , measured from figure  [ fig : pv ] .",
    "@xcite report co measurements with a 2  beam .",
    "ngc  4102 has a bar and lens , and gas motions in the nuclei of barred galaxies are often non - circular ; the co measurements clearly show a turnover in the rotation curve at radii greater than 3  , which @xcite attribute to gas streaming along a bar .",
    "the [ neii ] emission is more limited than that of the co , covering only @xmath45 of the co beams and not extending to the region where the co rotation curve turns over .",
    "the velocity gradient of the co is @xmath46 , or 1.2 km  s@xmath47 , over the inner 4.5(300 pc diameter ) measured from figure 1 of @xcite . that the [ neii ] emission has a greater velocity gradient than the co , but a very similar velocity range and even a similar distibution of brightness with velocity , indicates that the the co and [ ne ii ] emitting regions are not spatially identical and that the ionized gas , and thus the young stars , lie along the inner edge of the molecular gas ring",
    "this may be consistent with models for star formation in the presence of shear @xcite ; observations of the molecular gas with higher spatial resolution are needed to clarify the situation .",
    "assuming circular orbits and an inclination angle of @xmath48 @xcite , we calculate the total mass inside the full 135 pc of the [ neii ] ring to be @xmath49 .",
    "the co , which had a less steep slope over a larger distance , gives a dynamical mass of @xmath50 for a radius of @xmath20187 pc .",
    "our central mass for ngc  4102 is very similar to the masses inferred for the central @xmath20100  pc regions of nearby galaxies as diverse as m31 , ngc 4258 , and our own galactic center .",
    "the one velocity feature that does not fit the simple picture of a rotating ring is the weak feature at 781.0 @xmath19 ( 12.80 ) .",
    "this is blue - shifted @xmath51 from the rest velocity of [ neii ] and @xmath52 from the velocity of the galaxy .",
    "we believe it to be real because it appears in several positions and agrees in velocity with a blue - shifted feature in the near - infrared hi lines of pa@xmath21 and br@xmath28 @xcite ) .",
    "the blue component is an estimated one - third of the near - infrared pa@xmath53 and br@xmath28 fluxes , but this does not scale to the mid - infrared , where we estimate that the blue component is less than 10% of the peak of the [ ne ii ] line ( integrated over the same slit ) .",
    "when this feature was detected in the near - infrared @xcite called it an outflow , and assumed that the red side could not be seen because the extinction is higher to the red or far side of the system .",
    "that explanation is less satisfactory in light of the [ neii ] data .",
    "first , we see in the [ neii ] spectra that the blue feature is very narrow . its fwhm is hard to determine because of the low s / n but is clearly less than @xmath54 .",
    "agn outflows are usually broader by more than a factor of 10 . for an outflow to have such a narrow velocity spread",
    ", it must have a very narrow opening angle and be more like a jet than a cone .",
    "but there is no other evidence for a jet in ngc 4102 .",
    "second , if the absence of the redshifted feature in the near - infrared feature is in fact due to the higher extinction to the red or far side of the outflow , it may be expected to be detectable at @xmath13 m where the extinction is so much lower than at the near - infrared .",
    "there are @xmath55 wiggles around @xmath56 ( 12.88 ) , the wavelength equidistant to the red , but they are not convincing .",
    "we have at present no really satisfactory explanation of the blue - shifted feature .",
    "if it is an outflow , and the red side is not detected for extinction or another reason , it is a very unusual one .",
    "if it is due to the unlikely event of a foreground object , no such object appears at any wavelength yet observed and ngc  4102 is far out of the galactic plane .",
    "the blue feature is spatially extended and is detected at several positions north of the nucleus , so it can not be associated with the sw radio source .",
    "there are no features at that velocity ( or the red equivalent ) in the co position - velocity diagrams , and we know of no emission line near that wavelength .",
    "the high resolution [ neii ] observations of ngc  4102 have significantly clarified the starburst underway in that galaxy : it is located in a rotating ring , about 400  pc in diameter , consistent with the inner lindblad resonance .",
    "the starburst covers roughly the inner third of the rotating molecular disk observed in co. the entire [ neii ] flux observed by spitzer can be attributed to this starburst ring .",
    "the starburst produces a total ionization of @xmath57 , equal to @xmath58 standard o7 stars , and a mass in young stars of @xmath59 .",
    "the relative strengths of the near - infared continuum , radio continuum , and [ neii ] line vary around the ring , mostly due , we believe , to extinction effects .",
    "the most notable structure is a peak in the radio emission sw of the nucleus which , if it is a single embedded star cluster , is as bright as the largest and brightest known .",
    "observations with even higher resolution could perhaps resolve this and other structures in the ring .",
    "we obtain a dynamical mass of @xmath60 for the inner 164 pc radius , compared to @xmath61 found from the co results .",
    "the mass appears to grow with radius as @xmath62 .",
    "ngc 4102 contains a mild active nucleus as well as a starburst .",
    "when a nuclear starburst is found in the same galaxy with an agn , it raises the possibility that the agn has triggered the starburst somehow .",
    "but there is no evidence for agn influence on the ngc 4102 starburst .",
    "this star formation episode most likely reflects the secular evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the center of ngc 4102 is full of molecular gas streaming in ; enhanced star formation in such a region is  almost inevitable \" @xcite .",
    "the only possible sign of nuclear activity in the infrared is the high - velocity emission seen in the hydrogen lines and in [ neii ] .",
    "the cause of this velocity feature is still not known : if it is an agn outflow it is a very usual one , but if it is a foreground object it is no easier to explain .",
