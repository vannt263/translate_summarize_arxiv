    "in the pioneering paper @xcite shenvi , kempe and whaley demonstrated that a useful quantum algorithm can be designed based on quantum random - walks .",
    "this quantum random - walk search algorithm ( the skw algorithm ) can be used to find a vertex of a hypercube that is marked by an oracle .",
    "although the number of oracle calls needed by the skw algorithm scales with the size of the search space similarly to the grover search @xcite , its principle of operation is significantly different . since the pioneering work a variety of quantum algorithms",
    "have been proposed utilizing quantum random - walks , see for example @xcite .",
    "the skw algorithm may be divided into a quantum part , and a simple classical protocol in which the former is embedded .",
    "the quantum part is a perturbed grover walk on a hypercube started from an equally weighted superposition of initial states and iterated for a given number of steps , to be followed by a measurement on the output state to find the marked vertex .",
    "the perturbation of the grover coin is derived from the oracle , which is used to introduce position dependence into the coin operator . in this paper",
    ", we shall use the term skw quantum random - walk to refer to this special quantum random - walk . as it has been shown in @xcite the skw quantum random - walk yields the marked vertex with probability strictly less than @xmath2 ,",
    "therefore it is necessary to embed it into a classical protocol to find the marked vertex with certainty , or use an amplitude amplification scheme @xcite .",
    "the classical protocol of the skw algorithm is relatively simple : a measurement is made on the final state of the skw quantum random - walk , then its result is verified by querying the oracle directly . by repeating the algorithm and these two steps a sufficient number of times , we can make sure that the marked element is found with an arbitrary small failure probability .",
    "applying an amplitude amplification scheme would provide a more efficient way for increasing success probability , however , its use would mean departure from the quantum random walk paradigm .    the overhead caused by repeating the quantum random - walk several times ,",
    "although contributing only a constant factor to the time complexity , can be a considerable source of difficulties in certain experimental scenarios . in the present paper we present modifications to the skw algorithm which allow significant reduction of the number of necessary repetitions .",
    "we note that in 2 dimensions the spatial search algorithm by ambainis , kempe and rivosh @xcite also yields the target vertex after one run with probability less than one , i.e.  with only @xmath3 .",
    "recently , tulsi @xcite has proposed improvements to this algorithm , which allow the finding of the target vertex with probability @xmath4 after one run .",
    "the speedup in @xcite has been achieved by introducing an ancilla qubit into the computational space , which is similar in spirit to our improvement modification described in sec .",
    "[ sec : skw - optimal ] which uses an additional coin dimension .",
    "improvements of quantum walk - based searches have been studied also by other authors . in @xcite",
    "an optimization dedicated to the scattering random - walk implementation @xcite has been proposed , related to the findings we describe in section  [ sec : prob - neighbour ] . in @xcite",
    "the authors discussed the optimization of the quantum walk on a line by varying the coin operator parameters .",
    "in section  [ sec : prob - neighbour ] we prove that the final state of the skw quantum walk consists mainly of the target vertex and its next neighbours , and present modifications to the algorithm which exploit this property .",
    "these modifications can be used to reduce the number of repetitions of the skw quantum walk , and to reduce the number of independent verification queries to the oracle .",
    "we note that the task of verification may be problematic for certain implementations , e.g.in a spatial search implementation where a vertex being marked is a local property and not a property given by an oracle .",
    "such additional costs have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in connection with quantum walks .    based on the skw algorithm",
    "we develop an algorithm in section  [ sec : skw - optimal ] that displays query complexity @xmath5 of the original , thus the theoretically lowest for a search algorithm with a success probability close to 1 @xcite .",
    "our improvement is founded on the bipartite nature of the skw quantum random - walk , and we arrive at its final form after several steps .",
    "we note that some of these intermediate steps may be useful improvements on their own right , depending on the actual physical implementation .",
    "in section  [ sec : multiple - marked ] we outline the conditions under which the optimizations introduced in section  [ sec : skw - optimal ] can be used to find multiple marked vertices .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude our results .",
    "in this section we describe a property of the skw quantum walk that can be used to boost the probability of finding the marked vertex by doing a proper measurement on its final state .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the graph of the @xmath7 dimensional hypercube .",
    "the argumentation of the present paper relies heavily on the concept of the hamming weight and the parity of an integer , which can be easily related to each other .",
    "the hamming weight of an integer is the number of 1s in its binary string representation @xmath8 , and shall be denoted by @xmath9 in this paper .",
    "the parity of @xmath8 is then simply @xmath10 .",
    "a related concept is the hamming distance of two integers , say @xmath8 and @xmath11 , that is defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the bitwise addition modulo @xmath14 operator . following the notation of earlier work @xcite",
    ", the vertices @xmath15 of the hypercube are labelled by integers @xmath16 in such a way that the hamming distance between any two vertices connected by an edge is exactly 1 .",
    "the skw quantum walk takes place on the product hilbert space @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 dimensional hilbert space representing the vertices , and @xmath20 is the @xmath7 dimensional space associated with the quantum coin .",
    "the propagator of the skw quantum walk can therefore be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 correspond to the edges originating from the given vertex .",
    "if the target vertex marked by the oracle @xmath23 is denoted by @xmath24 , the perturbed coin operator can be written as @xmath25 for the skw quantum walk , @xmath26 is usually chosen to be the @xmath7 dimensional grover operator ( also known as the grover diffusion operator ) and @xmath27 is chosen to be @xmath28 .",
    "the results in this section , however , hold for any pair of inequivalent permutation invariant unitary coins . as it has been argued in @xcite , due to the symmetry of the hypercube graph the vertices can always be re - labelled in such a way that the marked vertex becomes @xmath29 .",
    "since with this choice the permutation invariance of the grover walk on the hypercube is conserved , the initial state @xmath30 allows the reduction to a walk on a line .",
    "the basis states for this collapsed quantum walk are defined as @xmath31 and the propagator becomes @xmath32 the coin operator of the walk on the line acquires a strong position dependence .",
    "for example when @xmath26 is the grover coin , in the collapsed basis it becomes @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the matrix is understood in the @xmath36 basis .",
    "the perturbed coin with @xmath37 can be written as @xmath38    it has been shown in @xcite that after an optimal number of iterations the probability @xmath39 of obtaining the target state @xmath40 in a measurement is close to @xmath2 , and that the optimal number of iterations is well estimated by the nearest integer to @xmath41 this means that the final state is composed mainly of the target state , and contains smaller contributions from its next and more distant neighbours @xcite . however",
    ", this statement can be refined by partitioning the skw quantum walk into two independent quantum walks .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the subspace spanned by states @xmath43 such that @xmath9 is even , and @xmath44 denote the subspace spanned by the states with @xmath9 being odd .",
    "the terms even and odd refer to a labelling where the target vertex is denoted by @xmath29 , therefore , in general , these subspaces must be defined according to the parity of @xmath45 .",
    "the two quantum walks are started in the hilbert spaces @xmath42 and @xmath44 , and evolve independently . in the following we shall term @xmath42 the _ even _ subspace , and @xmath44 the _ odd _ subspace of @xmath46 .",
    "it follows from the property of the parity function that this partitioning of @xmath46 is the same for all values of @xmath24 , however , the role of the two subspaces depends on the parity of @xmath24 .",
    "we can define the orthogonal projectors @xmath47 and @xmath48 that project to @xmath42 and @xmath44 , respectively . clearly , in the collapsed basis , the _ even _ subspace is spanned by the states ( [ eq : r - basis ] ) and ( [ eq : l - basis ] ) with @xmath49 being even , and the _ odd _ subspace is spanned by those with @xmath49 being odd . since @xmath50 = 0 $ ] and @xmath51 = 0 $ ] it follows from the definition of @xmath52 that    [ eq : u - ss - switch ] @xmath53    let us introduce the ( normalized ) states @xmath54 and express the initial state as @xmath55 .",
    "it can easily be seen that the action of @xmath56 on @xmath57 simplifies to @xmath58 by successive applications of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u - ss - switch ] ) and ( [ eq : u - oddpsi ] ) it can be shown that @xmath56 has the property    [ eq : even - odd - steps ] @xmath59    let us express the state of the walker after @xmath60 steps as @xmath61 and define @xmath62 , with setting @xmath63 for convenience .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath64 is clear from the definitions : @xmath65 is the probability of having the walker at the target vertex after @xmath60 iterations , and @xmath66 is the total probability of finding the walker at any of the nearest neighbours of the target node . using the above bipartition of the quantum walk it can be shown that the inequalities    [ eq : rel - p0-p1 ] @xmath67    hold for all @xmath68 .",
    "from which it follows that the probabilities @xmath69 satisfy the inequality @xmath70 for the details of the calculations see appendix  [ app : a ] .",
    "this property is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob - condense ] using a numerical simulation .     dimensions . in accordance with the analytic results ,",
    "the probability distribution has its maximum for the marked vertex @xmath29 reaching a value close to 1/2 .",
    "moreover , we observe that the nearest neighbours are also presented with high probability , and the sum of these probabilities is comparable to that of the marked vertex . ]    therefore , since we have @xmath71 , the total probability of measuring the target node or any of its direct neighbours is @xmath72 since @xmath73 is upper bounded by @xmath4 , for large @xmath7 the total probability must be approaching @xmath74 .",
    "naturally , the question arises : can eq .",
    "( [ eq : condensed - prob ] ) be turned to our advantage ? in the following we shall address this question , and answer positively .    first , let us analyze the most straight - forward way of taking advantage of eq .",
    "( [ eq : condensed - prob ] ) . according to the skw protocol",
    ", the validity of the measurement outcome @xmath75 after @xmath76 iterations is verified using the oracle .",
    "if the verification is positive the target node is found , otherwise the result is discarded and the skw quantum walk is repeated . however , this is unnecessary since from eq .",
    "( [ eq : condensed - prob ] ) we know that in case of a negative answer from the oracle , the probability that @xmath75 is a direct neighbour of @xmath24 is greater than @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to query the oracle with values from the set @xmath78 , from which the marked element can be extracted using the simplest classical protocol by an average of @xmath79 additional oracle queries .    in a scenario where the verification costs are dominating over all other cost",
    "it is crucial to perform the minimum number of necessary verification queries .",
    "one possibility could be to use amplitude amplification or another quantum based search , however , both these approaches mean a departure from the original hypercube quantum random - walk .    in the following",
    ", we propose an alternative approach to reduce the number of verification queries if the coin states can also be determined .",
    "let us set @xmath80 , and denote the outcome of the measurement on the coin state by @xmath81 . using the notations of ( [ eq : alpha - notation ] )",
    ", we can re - write eq .",
    "( [ eq : even - steps ] ) for the case @xmath82 , and obtain @xmath83 . from the unitarity of the coins , and the definition ( [ eq : s ] ) of @xmath52 it follows that we also have @xmath84 note , that this ensures also that he have @xmath85 , which is negligible for large @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the final state is composed mainly of the states @xmath86 and @xmath87 . thus ,",
    "if the measurement gives @xmath88 then the target vertex can be found with @xmath89 probability by taking @xmath90 .    in other words , if a complete measurement can be made on the coin state , the marked element can be determined with @xmath89 probability after a single execution of the skw algorithm and one verification query to the oracle .",
    "in the present section , based on the skw algorithm we develop a search algorithm which finds the marked vertex of a hypercube using the optimal number of oracle queries .",
    "in contrast to the modifications of [ sec : prob - neighbour ] which essentially affect only the classical processing part , the improvement proposed in the present section requires a modification of the quantum walk itself .",
    "the improvement is based on the bipartite nature of the skw quantum walk , which implies the invariance of the _ even _ and _ odd _ subspaces under two iterations of @xmath56 , @xmath91 = [ p_e , u^{\\prime 2r } ] = 0 , \\quad ( r = 0 , 1 ,    \\ldots ) , \\label{eq : e - o - invariance}\\ ] ] which follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u - ss - switch ] ) .",
    "first , consider the projection of the state of the walker after @xmath92 iterations onto the _ even _ subspace . in the spirit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e - o - invariance ] ) we can see that the projection of the final state corresponds to a similar projection of the initial state , which we can write as @xmath93 introducing @xmath94 we conclude that for the probability @xmath95 to find the marked node after @xmath96 iterations starting from the _ even _ initial state @xmath97 the relation @xmath98 holds .",
    "this is an encouraging result , since it suggests that the marked element can be directly found with high probability after a single execution of the skw algorithm without any verification queries .",
    "however , the choice @xmath29 is actually the result of the mapping @xmath99 , thus we do not know in general which is the _ even _ subspace and which is the _ odd _ subspace .",
    "the information about the parity of the marked vertex is clearly contained in the oracle . an efficient way of extracting this information is to repeat the quantum walk twice , once starting from the initial state @xmath97 and once starting from @xmath57 .",
    "note , that it is not necessary to know which one is which , since @xmath97 will yield @xmath100 with nearly unit probability .",
    "therefore , the target vertex can be identified by testing the two measurement outcomes @xmath101 and @xmath102 on the oracle .    instead of repeating the algorithm twice , it is possible to construct another skw quantum walk in which it is guaranteed that the marked element corresponds to a vertex with even parity .",
    "the principle of this modification is the mapping of all the vertices of the @xmath7 dimensional hypercube to the even parity vertices of an @xmath103 dimensional hypercube .",
    "since the number of even and odd vertices is equal for a hypercube in every dimension , the mapping between the original vertices and the even parity vertices of the larger hypercube can be made one - to - one .    in the following ,",
    "we assume that the oracle is given as an operator acting on the hilbert space @xmath18 associated to the @xmath7 dimensional hypercube , and we shall construct an skw quantum walk in @xmath103 dimensions using the extended oracle acting on the hilbert space @xmath104 .",
    "the vertices @xmath8 of the original hypercube are mapped to the even parity sites of the extended hypercube by the map @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the parity of @xmath8 .",
    "this mapping can be viewed as appending one bit to the bit string representation of the original vertex , the value of the bit being @xmath4 for odd parity vertices , and @xmath107 for even parity vertices .",
    "the reverse mapping simply drops the appended bit for even parity input , while the odd parity vertices of the extended hypercube do not correspond to any vertices of the original graph .",
    "dimensions to a hypercube in @xmath108 dimensions without distinguishing even and odd parity vertices .",
    "the operator @xmath109 denotes the application of the pauli @xmath110 operation to the last qubit .",
    "the effect of operator @xmath109 is switching between the image and the anti - image of a vertex . ]    in this way the marked vertex is known to be mapped to an even parity vertex on the extended hypercube .",
    "the modification of the oracle @xmath23 to return positive result only for the new marked vertex is straight forward .",
    "let the operators of the @xmath111 dimensional extended skw quantum walk be distinguished from the original @xmath7 dimensional one by adding a @xmath112 superscript .",
    "therefore , the coin operators acting on @xmath113 are denoted by @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and the propagator operator on @xmath116 by @xmath117 .",
    "similarly , the perturbed coin operator is denoted by @xmath118 . with this mapping ,",
    "the procedure described above can be applied very efficiently since the `` good '' initial state @xmath97 is prescribed by the construction .",
    "consequently , a single execution of the @xmath111 dimensional skw quantum walk is sufficient to find the marked vertex with a probability close to unity .",
    "note that the extension to @xmath103 dimensions changes the optimal number of iterations , which amounts to an increase of the query complexity by a factor of @xmath119 .",
    "the query complexity can be reduced by noting that at every second iteration , the coin operator @xmath120 could effectively be replaced by the unperturbed coin operator @xmath121 , thus the number of oracle queries can be reduced by @xmath2 . moreover , as shown in appendix  [ app : b ] , by forcing the coin operator to be @xmath121 for every second iteration , the equality @xmath122 holds , where @xmath109 denotes the quantum not gate , @xmath110 , acting on the last qubit .",
    "thus , an initial state of uniform superposition ( [ eq : psi0 ] ) can be used , yielding the image ( @xmath123 ) and the anti - image ( @xmath124 ) of the target vertex with a total probability close to one .",
    "therefore , by performing a measurement that ignores the last qubit we obtain the marked vertex @xmath24 with probability @xmath125 .    using the formula ( [ eq : tf ] ) to calculate the query complexity ,",
    "we find that the modified algorithm completes using @xmath126 oracle queries which is identical to what is needed by the grover search algorithm , and known to be the best achievable on a quantum computer for a success probability of one @xcite .    the storage complexity of the improved algorithm can be reduced by noting that the auxiliary qubit can be eliminated using the identities @xmath127 & = & [ x , u''{}^\\mathrm{(+ ) } ] = 0,\\\\    x { |\\psi_0\\rangle } & = & { |\\psi_0\\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , the reduction affects only the dimensionality of the position space , and leaves the coin space @xmath103 dimensional . with some algebra",
    ", we obtain the reduced propagator from @xmath128 as @xmath129 thus , the coin states @xmath130 with @xmath131 become the coin states of a quantum random - walk on the original @xmath7 dimensional hypercube , while the state @xmath132 corresponds to a coin state instructing the walker to remain at the same vertex at the next iteration .",
    "the propagator can equivalently be understood as describing a quantum random - walk on a regular graph consisting of an @xmath7 dimensional hypercube having a self loop edge attached to each of its vertices .",
    "the final version of the quantum walk for optimal search can therefore be expressed by the alternating sequence of the unitary operators @xmath133 acting on an @xmath19 dimensional vertex space , and an @xmath134 dimensional coin space .",
    "in the present section we consider the optimization problem when the number of marked vertices is more than one .",
    "although the skw algorithm is guaranteed to work only when the oracle marks a single vertex , numerical calculations suggest that it can also be used to find multiple marked vertices as long as the number of marked vertices is small compared to the size of the search space .    to answer the question whether the skw algorithm can be used to find multiple marked vertices is beyond the scope of the present paper . instead",
    ", here we focus on the question of applicability of the improvement described in sec .",
    "[ sec : skw - optimal ] . in the following",
    ", we shall show that the modified algorithm can be applied directly to the search for multiple marked vertices when the skw algorithm on the extended hypercube yields sufficient results . to formalize the task of finding multiple marked vertices ,",
    "let us denote the number of elements marked by the oracle by @xmath135 , and their labels by @xmath136 , such that @xmath137 .",
    "the coin operator of the skw quantum walk can therefore be written as @xmath138 and the unitary evolution operator as @xmath139 .",
    "this unitary operator is then iterated a given number of times to obtain a final state that is composed mainly of the states corresponding to the marked vertices .    for simplicity",
    ", here we consider the variant of the improvement using the walk on the extended @xmath103 dimensional hypercube using the even parity initial state .",
    "this is sufficient , since it is equivalent to those what we obtain by using the quantum walk with two coins , and after the reduction back to the @xmath7 dimensional hypercube .",
    "clearly , by defining the @xmath111 dimensional extension @xmath140 of @xmath141 we arrive at the unitary evolution operator @xmath142 which also obeys @xmath143 since all the marked vertices are mapped to the _ even _ subspace . for the same reason , we have for every @xmath144 , the relation @xmath145 according to the definition ( [ eq : psi - e0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if the total probability of finding any of the marked vertices in the final state of the extended skw algorithm is close to @xmath2 , the modified algorithm yields them with probability close to unity .",
    "we have proposed two alternative approaches for improving the skw quantum random - walk search algorithm .",
    "both improvements are centered around increasing the success probability after one run . in the first part of the paper we shown that the next neighbours of the target can be obtained with high probability , and that this can be exploited to reduce the number of repetitions or independent oracle queries to one or two .",
    "we note , that for certain implementations , a lower repetition count may have a serious impact on efficiency .",
    "in the second part of the paper we have developed a two - coin quantum random - walk search algorithm on a hypercube with self - loop edges .",
    "we have pointed out that the speedup over the original skw algorithm in terms of oracle queries is @xmath146 .",
    "this makes the algorithm equivalent to the grover search in terms of query complexity , therefore , present an optimal solution to the search problem if the success probability of 1 is required @xcite .",
    "we have also considered the optimization problem of finding multiple marked vertices .",
    "we have shown that if the skw quantum walk mapped to to an @xmath134 dimensional hypercube yields the marked vertices with probability close to 1/2 , the algorithm in [ sec : skw - optimal ] can be applied unmodified , resulting in the same improvement as for the case of a single marked vertex .      using the notation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha - notation ] ) , let us consider an arbitrary @xmath147 ( @xmath148 is set to 0 by definition ) . in one iteration , @xmath147 is first transformed to some @xmath149 and @xmath150 by the coin operator @xmath151 . upon inspecting the definition of @xmath86",
    "we find that due to the unitarity of the coin @xmath151 we have @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
