    "this can be used to explore the ability of the _ hyperz _ code of recovering redshifts and morphological types of galaxies , and judge whether or how the recovered parameters are affected by the input parameters ( including ultraviolet [ uv ] photometry , binary interactions and population synthesis models ) .",
    "the reasons of discussing the influence of uv photometry and binary interactions on the determinations of photo-@xmath0s and morphological types are as follows .    1 .    in those previous works using template fitting method to obtain photo-@xmath0s of galaxies ,",
    "the template spectra usually came from real objects or population synthesis models of single stellar populations ( ssps ) , rather than the population synthesis models including binary interactions .",
    "as for population synthesis models of binary stellar populations ( bsps ) , the yunnan group @xcite have considered various binary interactions in evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) models , and drawn the conclusion that the inclusion of binary interactions can affect the overall shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of population , in particular , the sed of population in the uv passbands is bluer by 2 - 3mag at @xmath26gyr if binary interactions are accounted for . above conclusion further has been confirmed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hpl07 ) , who included hot subdwarf b stars ( sdbs ) in population .",
    "the bluer sed in the uv passbands can be explained by that binary interactions can create some important classes of objects , such as sdbs for a population older than @xmath141gyr ( hpl07 ) and blue stragglers at 0.5@xmath141.5gyr .",
    "observations find that almost all elliptical galaxies have uv - upturn phenomenon , i.e. , the flux increases with the wavelength decreasing from 2000 to 1200@xmath27 ( hpl07 ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by the eps models of bsps ( hpl07 ) .",
    "thus , if only optical photometry and/or the eps models of ssps are used to obtain photo-@xmath0s and morphologies of elliptical galaxies , whether these results are reasonable or not ?",
    "another fact is that the photo-@xmath0s , which are derived by using the _ hyperz _ code under the condition of neglecting uv photometry , significantly deviate from the spectroscopic ones for some galaxies in the redshift range @xmath28 ( also see fig .",
    "[ fig : lowz - dia1 ] ) .     in this work ,",
    "we use two samples of galaxies : spectroscopic and morphological .",
    "the galaxies in the spectroscopic sample are selected randomly from the sdss dr7 and their spectroscopic redshifts are available .",
    "the galaxies in the morphological sample are from the catalogue of @xcite , which presented the morphological types of 2,253 bright galaxies in the sdss dr3 by using independent classification scheme ( visual classification ) .",
    "all galaxies in both samples have matched with the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) dr4 ( see section 3 for details ) .",
    "moreover , we not only use the population synthesis models of ssps but also those of bsps to construct theoretical template library ( see section 2 ) . @xcite",
    "have used the sdss and galex photometric data to study the redshifts of galaxies , but they used the population synthesis models of ssps .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we describe the method used to obtain photo-@xmath0 and the galaxy samples , respectively . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we obtain photo-@xmath0 estimates for the spectroscopic galaxy sample and morphologies for the morphological galaxy sample , and discuss the effects of uv photometry and binary interactions on them .",
    "finally we present a summary and conclusions in section 6 .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < , > , < \" , ]     [ tab : flts ]    to check the ability of recovering photo-@xmath0s and morphological types of galaxies , we need to collect the galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts and morphological classifications , and the redshift coverage of galaxies should be as wide as possible . but due to the limit of observations the galaxies with known classifications are relatively bright and their redshifts are low , two galaxy samples ( termed spectroscopic and morphological ) are used in this work , and they are used to study the ability of recovering photo-@xmath0s and galaxy types , respectively .    the galaxies in the spectroscopic sample are selected from the sdss dr7 . in order to ensure that the selected objects can be used in the studies of section 4 , we use the following criteria : the spectroscopic redshifts must be available ( from _ sdss.specobj_ ) , and galaxy must be defined as the object class by all of the following three methods : spectral classification ( _ sdss.specobj.specclass=2_ ) , plplugmap type ( _ sdss.specobj.objtype=0 _ ) and morphological classification ( _ sdss.galaxy.type=3_ ) . initially we obtain a sample of 773,126 galaxies from the sdss dr7 . to save the computational time we use one - seventy of this galaxy sample as the _ primitive _ spectroscopic sample , which totally comprises 11,043 galaxies and in which the galaxies are randomly selected .",
    "the galaxies in the morphological sample are from the catalogue of @xcite , which contains 2,253 galaxies with _ petrosian _ magnitude @xmath29 brighter than 16mag in the north equatorial stripe from the sdss dr3 .",
    "the morphological classification in the catalogue of @xcite is obtained by visual inspection of images in the @xmath30 band .",
    "removal the objects mismatched with the sdss dr7 ( the matching radius is 6arcsec ) produces a initial morphological sample of 1,792 galaxies .",
    "note that the redshifts of galaxies in this catalogue are low ( less than 0.2 ) .",
    "we adopt the matching method of @xcite and @xcite between the sdss dr7 and the galex dr4 , i.e. , the matching radius between sdss dr7 and galex dr4 is 6.0arcsec , the nearest neighbor is taken as a true associate if its distance is smaller than the matching radius .",
    "when the nearest object has no simultaneous @xmath1 and @xmath2 detections , the nearer object ( within the matching radius ) with simultaneous @xmath1 and @xmath2 detections will be taken as its associate ( 361 galaxies for spectroscopic sample ) .",
    "if all objects within the matching radius have no simultaneous @xmath1 and @xmath2 detections , the missing magnitude of the nearest object will be replaced by the corresponding one of the nearer objects ( within the matching radius ) .",
    "at last , we obtain a final spectroscopic sample of 6,531 galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowz - reg ] we give the spatial distribution of these matched ( i.e. , the spectroscopic sample ) and mismatched galaxies in the _ primitive _ spectroscopic sample , from it we see that the galaxies in the spectroscopic sample are indeed randomly distributed .",

    "the spectroscopic and morphological galaxy samples are used in the studies of sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "sdss dr7 provides the values of various magnitudes ( such as _ devmag , expmag , modelmag , petromag , psfmag , _ etc ) .",
    "we choose sdss _ modelmag _ ( exactly , the shorthand alias for _ modelmag _ ) of galaxies since the sdss _ c - model _ magnitude ( based on de vaucouleurs and exponential fitting ) is an adequate proxy to use as a universal magnitude for all types of objects and agrees with _ petrosian _ magnitude excellently for galaxies .",
    "moreover , the sdss _ c - model _ magnitude is a reliable estimate of galaxy flux and can account for the effects of local seeing and thus is less dependent on local seeing variations ( www.sdss.org/dr7/algorithms/photometry.html ) .",

    "that is to say , the inclusion of uv photometry would make the difference between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath49 ) smaller ( from 1.8 - 2.8 to less than 0.2 ) for these galaxies .",
    "when we only use optical data to obtain the photo-@xmath0 estimates of these galaxies , we must be cautious .",
    "then what are the characteristics of these galaxies ?      according to the results about @xmath34 and @xmath36 , we divide the spectroscopic galaxy sample into 4 subsamples for each model , the galaxies in the 1 - 4 subsamples satisfy the following conditions in turn :    1 .   both @xmath34 and @xmath36",

    "the secondary peak ( in the regime @xmath71 ) is explained by that the 4000@xmath27 break , which is the most commonly used spectral feature for optical photo-@xmath0 determination , is greatly reduced [ making it more difficult to use as a redshift indicator ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ] , and by that in the @xmath71 region the 4000@xmath27 break goes beyond the wavelength coverage of @xmath35 filters [ making it impossible to use as a redshift indicator ] . when uv data is combined , the lyman break , which is exhibited by all galaxies , would emerge in the uv ranges if @xmath71 , this would largely decrease the probability of the solution in the high redshift domain .",
