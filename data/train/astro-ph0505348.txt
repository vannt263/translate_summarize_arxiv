    "the process of galaxy formation and evolution is one of the most important unsolved problems in astrophysics .",
    "deep imaging of blank field is a vital method for studying the properties of galaxies in the distant universe @xcite .",
    "the hubble deep field ( hdf ) taken by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) had revealed deep images of the universe at optical wavelengths @xcite , and provided us with valuable information of the distant universe .",
    "however , for high - redshift galaxies at @xmath10 , the rest - frame optical light , that exhibits the fundamental structure of stellar component in galaxies , shifts into the infrared ( e.g. @xcite ) . therefore , the near infrared ( nir ) deep imaging becomes important to study the formation and evolution of galaxies at high - redshifts .",
    "moreover , the uncertainties due to the evolution of galaxies and extinction by interstellar dust are less significant in the longer wavelength .",
    "thus , deep imaging in the @xmath11 ( 2.2@xmath1 m ) band , that is the longest wavelength at which the high - sensitive observations can be carried out from the ground , is essential to study the fundamental properties of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "a number of @xmath11-band imaging surveys were carried out using ground - based large telescopes with different spatial coverages and limiting magnitudes ( e.g. @xcite ) . among these surveys ,",
    "the deep @xmath0 ( 2.12@xmath1 m ) imaging of the subaru deep field ( sdf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the subaru / cisco @xcite achieved a limiting magnitude of @xmath5 ( 5@xmath4 ) for point sources with integration time of 9.7 hours .",
    "@xcite studied the galaxy number counts in the sdf and suggested that a number evolution may occur or a new population may emerge in the faint end , while the number count at brighter magnitude range is consistent with the pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) without number evolution .",
    "@xcite derived the contributed flux of galaxies to the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) in the @xmath11 band using the sdf number count data .",
    "they concluded , from the observed flat slope of differential galaxy number count ( @xmath12 ) in the faint end and the theoretical estimate of the number of missed galaxies in the sdf survey , that more than 90% of the galaxies contributed to the ebl in the @xmath11 band has already been resolved into discrete sources of galaxies .",
    "however , the ebl flux derived in this way accounts only for less than a half of the ebl flux measured in the same @xmath11 band in the form of diffuse emission @xcite , indicating a problem of missing @xmath11 light in the universe , which can not be explained by normal galaxies .",
    "therefore , even deeper imaging is required to investigate the galaxy population in the faint end and the origin of missing @xmath11 light in the ebl .",
    "recently , a deep imaging of the hubble deep field south ( hdf - s ) was carried out in the @xmath13 band ( 2.16 @xmath1 m ) using the vlt / isaac ( fires , * ? ? ? * ) and reached a limiting magnitude of 23.8 mag ( 5@xmath4 ) with integration time of 35.6 hours . however , because unrealistically long integration time is required to increase the sensitivity further from this level , the sensitivity of deep imaging observations under usual seeing condition has almost reached the attainable limit .    to push the limit of deep nir imaging",
    ", we initiated a new deep imaging program in the @xmath0 band using the subaru adaptive optics ( ao ) system .",
    "ao compensates the disturbed wavefront by earth s atmosphere and provides nearly diffraction - limited spatial resolution .",
    "because the flux in the diffraction - limited core largely increases , it is expected to improve the sensitivity of detecting faint objects with ao .",
    "although the sensitivity gain with ao is known to be small for extended objects such as galaxies , we can improve the sensitivity of detecting high - redshift galaxies because they are expected to be compact according to the prediction of hierarchical cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "studies of high resolution deep imaging by the hst / nicmos have also shown that faint galaxies at high redshifts are quite compact in the @xmath14 ( 1.6@xmath1 m ) band @xcite .    first objective of this program is to investigate the galaxy population in the unprecedented faint end ( @xmath15 ) with high detection completeness .",
    "this may reveal a significant faint galaxy population that contributes to the ebl in the @xmath0 band .",
    "second objective is to study the morphology of high - redshift galaxies at _ rest - frame optical wavelengths _ with high - resolution ao image .",
    "formation of the hubble sequence is thought to have occurred at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "high - resolution deep @xmath0 imaging of galaxies in this redshift range may clearly reveal the process of morphology formation of galaxies .    in this paper , we report the first results of our deep @xmath0 imaging program with the subaru ao system .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "the field selection and observational strategy are summarized in  2 .",
    "the procedure of data reduction is described in  3 .",
    "the procedure of source detection and photometry is described in  4 .",
    "the analysis of reduced images and detected source counts is given in  5 .",
    "the quality of our ao deep @xmath0 imaging is examined in  6 .",
    "the results of the galaxy number counts , the contributed flux of galaxies to the ebl , and the size distribution of detected galaxies are discussed in  7 .",
    "finally , the summary is given in  8 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the magnitude system where vega is 0.0 mag , and the cosmological parameters of @xmath17=0.3 , @xmath18=0.7 , and @xmath19=70 km / s / mpc .",
    "our observed field is a part of the well - studied deep field called `` subaru deep field ( sdf ) '' , which is a blank sky region near the north galactic pole @xcite .",
    "this field has been observed extensively by the subaru telescope @xcite as an observatory project with a wide wavelength coverage from optical to nir @xcite .",
    "@xmath20-band images for a 2  @xmath2 2  area of the sdf were obtained with the subaru / cisco @xcite and @xmath21-band images for a 30  @xmath2 37  area , which includes the cisco field , were obtained by the subaru / suprime - cam @xcite .",
    "the sdf was originally chosen such that a reasonably bright star is located in the field as a wavefront guide star for ao observation .",
    "we placed this bright ( @xmath22 ) star near the center of our 1  @xmath2 1  ao field .",
    "the center coordinates of our ao field was set to be @xmath23=13@xmath2424@xmath25236 and @xmath26=+2730304 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we call this field `` subaru super deep field ( ssdf ) '' . the location of the ssdf relative to the sdf is shown in figure [ field ] . because very deep @xmath21 images of the sdf have already been obtained , it is possible to determine the photometric redshift of detected galaxies in the ssdf .",
    "seeing - limited infrared @xmath27 and @xmath0 images of the sdf have also been taken by @xcite and a part of this field is overlapped with our ao field ( see figure [ field ] ) .",
    "thus , the quality of our ao deep images can be directly compared to that of conventional seeing - limited deep images ( see  6 ) .",
    "our observations were carried out using the subaru ao system @xcite and the ircs ( infra - red camera and spectrograph , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) both mounted on the cassegrain focus of the subaru telescope . the ircs imager is equipped with a raytheon aladdin iii 1024@xmath21024 insb array , offering two pixel scales of 23 and 58 mas for imaging in a wavelength range of 0.9@xmath285.5 @xmath1 m . we used the pixel scale of 58 mas to cover a wider field of view with the @xmath0 filter ( 1.96@xmath282.30 @xmath1 m , @xmath29 wm@xmath30m@xmath31 , @xcite ) .",
    "the subaru ao system uses a curvature sensor with 36 control elements , which provides a stellar image of strehl ratio ( the ratio of the observed star peak to the peak value of a perfect telescope diffraction pattern ) of @xmath320.28 and full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath32007 in the @xmath11 band with an @xmath22 guide star under best observing condition .",
    "the improved image quality is expected to increase the detection sensitivity to a point source by @xmath32 1 mag . however , because ao correction performance degrades with increasing distance from a guide star ( see  6.3 for details ) , the strehl ratio at the area away from a guide star is lower than the best value . moreover , since the strehl ratio should vary with time depending on the observational condition , the resultant strehl ratio for long exposure time is averaged and lower than the best value . similarly , the fwhm for long - time exposure image could be broader than the best value at the area away from a guide star . for the present data , the achieved strehl ratio and the fwhm , which were measured from a point - like source located at 24 arcsec away from the guide star , are 0.1 and 018 on average , respectively . because the galaxies in our field of view are distributed within about 40 arcsec away from the guide star ,",
    "our measured strehl ratio and fwhm are typical for our observation .",
    "we carried out our observations for a total of nine nights with almost photometric condition .",
    "the observing log is given in table [ log ] . during the observations",
    ", we repeated the set of nine - position dithering with a 3@xmath23 grid of 20 separation .",
    "individual exposure time of 90 or 120 sec was adopted such that the sky background does not saturate the detector well .",
    "since a few bright stars reached saturation even with this short exposure time , residual images following the dithering pattern appeared around the stars due to the memory effect of the insb array ( see grid patterns around bright stars in figure [ ssdf_image ] ) .",

    "the sky variation corresponds to about @xmath330.1 mag in the limiting magnitude variation of each frame ( figure [ obs_condition]a ) , suggesting that the observing condition was almost stable throughout all observing nights .",
    "the correction performance of ao changes every moment depending largely on the observational condition .",
    "we monitored the variation of spatial resolution by measuring the fwhm of a point - like source which has the sharpest and nearly circular profile in our field of view ( marked `` s '' in figure [ ssdf_image ] ) except for the saturated bright stars .",
    "since this point - like source `` s '' is too faint to be detected in each single frame , we combined each set of nine - point dithering to measure the fwhm .",
    "the variation of fwhm after ao correction was found to be small for all frames ( figure [ obs_condition]b ) .",
    "thus , the correction performance of ao was stable and the point spread function ( psf ) remained to be constant for each night .",
    "we reduced the data with iraf software packages . before the data reduction , we checked all data frames visually and removed some low - signal frames due to cirrus as well as some frames with unusual dark patterns due to unstable detector temperature at the beginning of continuous exposures .",
    "we rejected these frames ( @xmath32 15% of all frames ) before the data reduction and the resultant total integration time of all used frames is about 26.8 hours .",
    "flat fielding was performed using the median combined sky flat frame .",
    "the sky flat frames were created for each night using the dark subtracted raw frames . in generating the sky flat frames , bright and extended objects in each raw frame were masked in order to reduce their contribution to the final flat frame .",
    "we made the position map of the bad pixels on the detector from the dark and flat frames , which were used for picking the pixels with extraordinarily high counts and the pixels with extremely low sensitivity , respectively .",
    "bad pixels on our observed frames were removed by interpolation using this position map .",
    "the nine frames of each dithering set were median - combined to create the sky frame for each set . before this process ,",
    "all of the discernible objects are removed with interpolation by adjacent sky counts to reduce the contribution of the individual objects to the resultant sky level .",
    "the sky subtraction was performed for each set of nine - point dithering ( every 810 or 1080 seconds ) to minimize the effect of time variation of the sky background .",
    "then , we shifted and combined all of the sky subtracted frames with exposure time weighting .",
    "the image offsets were determined at a sub - pixel level from the bright objects in each frame .",
    "the final @xmath0 image is shown in figure [ ssdf_image ] .",
    "the average fwhm of final image was about 018 for the relatively bright ( @xmath34 ) point - like source `` s '' . throughout this paper",
    ", we used the profile of this point - like source as the psf of our ao image .",
    "source detection and photometry were performed by the sextractor @xcite . before the source detection",
    ", the final image was smoothed by a gaussian filter ( @xmath4 = 1 pix ) to give an optimal source detection capability with less spurious detection .",
    "we defined the detection threshold as the 1.5@xmath4 level of the surface brightness fluctuation of the sky ( 23.64 mag / arcsec@xmath9 ) .",
    "if more than 19 contiguous pixels have larger counts than the threshold , we regarded it as a positively detected source . to reduce the risk of spurious detection , some areas near the bright stars and the known ghosts of bright stars are excluded from the detection area ( see figure [ ssdf_image ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the total number of detected sources is 236 within the net detection area of 0.9 arcmin@xmath9 , although some spurious detections due to statistical noise may be included in this number .",
    "we performed photometry of detected sources in terms of aperture magnitude , isophotal magnitude , and total magnitude ( see @xcite for further description of each magnitude ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we mostly use the total magnitude except for the discussion of size distribution in  7.2 , where we use the isophotal magnitude .",
    "the photometric calibration was carried out using the infrared faint standard star gspc p330-e @xcite .",
    "we took the image of this standard star at airmass @xmath35 1 in a photometric night and used it as the photometric reference for the object frames which were taken in the same night at the same airmass .",
    "then , a bright galaxy ( @xmath36 ) in the field was used as the photometric reference for the final image . the resultant zero point in the final combined image",
    "is @xmath37 mag / adu .    understanding the noise properties is crucial because the limiting magnitude and photometric uncertainty rely on them . the photometric uncertainty in typical near - infrared deep images is well described by the poisson noise of the background signal in each pixel .",
    "however , image processing , such as shift and combination , has introduced correlations between neighboring pixels .",
    "if the photometric uncertainty was estimated from linear scaling of the pixel - to - pixel variation , we would underestimate it . to estimate the true uncertainty of photometry , we measured the sky fluxes in several tens of circular apertures at random position in the final image and regarded the standard deviation @xmath4 of the measured fluxes as the photometric uncertainty .",
    "we changed the radius of circular apertures ranging from 1 to 40 pixels ( 0058@xmath2823 ) to cover all the photometric apertures of detected sources ( figure [ r_noise ] ) .",
    "we fitted @xmath4 with a two - dimensional function of the aperture radius , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the fitting parameters .",
    "we used this function for calculating the photometric uncertainty of each detected sources with various apertures .",
    "the measured uncertainty with this method largely exceeds the uncertainty expected from linear scaling of the pixel - to - pixel noise ( dashed line in figure [ r_noise ] ) .",
    "the large discrepancy at large aperture was also reported in @xcite .",
    "this could be caused by correlated fluctuations of the background on large spatial scale .",
    "we estimated the limiting magnitude for point sources using the point - like source `` s '' in the final image .",
    "the limiting magnitude was determined by using a diagram that shows signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the point - like - source `` s '' as a function of an aperture radius ( solid line in figure [ snr ] ) , that was represented as a ratio of flux to photometric uncertainty within an aperture .",
    "the achieved 5@xmath4 limiting magnitude for point sources is @xmath3 ( 5@xmath4 ) with an aperture diameter of 02 , where the aperture size was determined to have the maximum snr .",
    "this is the faintest @xmath11-band limiting magnitude for point sources achieved to date .",
    "because galaxies would have more extended profile than point sources , the limiting magnitude for galaxies should be brighter than that for point sources .",
    "thus , we also estimated a limiting magnitude for galaxies with the similar method as for point sources using a galaxy `` g1 '' ( see figure [ ssdf_image ] ) , that is a disk galaxy which has the typical effective radius ( @xmath41 ) in the ssdf ( see  6.2 for details ) .",
    "the achieved 5@xmath4 limiting magnitude for galaxies is @xmath5 ( 5@xmath4 ) for 06 aperture .",
    "the number of detected sources brighter than the limiting magnitude for point sources is 145 , while the total number of detected sources is 236 with the faintest magnitude of @xmath42 .",
    "at the fainter magnitude , the detection completeness decreases because of the statistical noise .",
    "we estimated the detection completeness for point sources by conducting the same source detection as described in  4 but with a large number of artificial point sources placed at random positions in the final image .",
    "the artificial point sources were created from the point - like source in the final image ( source `` s '' in figure [ ssdf_image ] ) by applying a flux scaling in the range of @xmath43 .",
    "thick solid line with filled circles in figure [ completeness_star ] shows the detection completeness curve for point sources in our final image as a function of @xmath0 magnitude .",
    "we estimated that 50% completeness for point sources is achieved at @xmath44 , which means a half of all galaxies can be detected at this magnitude , and it is about 0.6 magnitude deeper than previous deep imaging such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , our data should offer the most reliable source detection down to 25 mag .",
    "we also estimated the detection completeness for galaxies with artificial galaxies that have the typical size in the ssdf .",
    "the artificial galaxies were created to have the same surface brightness profile as the galaxy `` g1 '' , which was used in the limiting magnitude estimation in  4 .",
    "we placed them at random positions with varied flux in the range of @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ completeness_gal ] shows the estimated detection completeness curve for galaxies .",
    "the completeness curve for galaxies in our final image are shown as thick solid line with filled circles . for a comparison ,",
    "the completeness curve for extended source in the previous deep imaging by @xcite is also shown as thin dashed line with stellate symbols in the same diagram .",
    "we estimated that 50% completeness for extended source is achieved at @xmath45 , that is about 0.6 mag fainter than that of @xcite .",
    "this magnitude gain is same as for the gain for point source , suggesting that the ao system improves the efficiency of detecting high - redshift galaxies as well as that of point sources . in this paper ,",
    "the detection completeness for point source is used to correct the number counts .",
    "therefore , the detection completeness here should be considered upper limits and then the corrected counts should be considered lower limits .",
    "we detected the objects down to @xmath46 in our final image .",
    "based on the photometric measurements of these objects , we derived the number counts in the 0.5 magnitude bin ( table [ count ] ) . the number counts , in principle , contain not only the counts from galaxies , but also the counts from the galactic stars and spurious detections due to the effect of statistical noise",
    ". the contribution of the galactic stars to our number counts should be negligible , because the expected star counts toward the galactic pole are less than 0.2 mag@xmath31acrmin@xmath47 in all magnitude range @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the contribution of spurious detection is significant in the faint end , where the signal - to - noise ratio for the detection becomes lower .",
    "we estimated the number of spurious detections from an artificial noise frame which was created by combining the sky subtracted frames without adjusting the dithering offset .",
    "the combination was conducted with the options of exposure time weighting , which is similar to the combination of the final image . before the combination ,",
    "all discernible objects in each image were removed by interpolation and the estimated noise from the adjacent pixels was added on the interpolated pixels . even after removing the discernible objects ,",
    "even fainter objects could be remained in the noise in each single frame . in order to minimize the contribution of the light from such faint objects ,",
    "the sign of each image was reversed before the combination .",
    "we applied the same detection procedure to the artificial noise image as used for the source detection .",
    "the resultant number of spurious detections in each 0.5 magnitude bin is given in table [ count ] .",
    "we derived the galaxy number count in each magnitude bin by subtracting the number of spurious detection from the raw count .",
    "the estimated galaxy counts are listed in table [ count ] and shown in figure [ numcnt_ssdfraw ] .",

    "because a part of the sdf field of view is included in the ssdf ( see figure [ field ] ) , we can make a direct comparison between ao and seeing - limited data .",
    "figure [ encircle ] shows the encircled flux plot of the point sources detected in the ssdf and the sdf .",
    "the 50% of the total flux is contained within a radius of 018 for the ssdf , while 027 for the sdf .",
    "the higher flux concentration due to the ao correction resulted in much higher sensitivity . to estimate the sensitivity gain for our ao observation against seeing - limited observation , we derived the 5@xmath4 limiting magnitude for point sources in the ssdf and in the sdf with the same method as described in  4 .",
    "the 5@xmath4 limiting magnitude is about 22.9 ( 02 aperture ) for the ssdf and 22.4 ( 04 aperture ) for the sdf with an hour integration time .",
    "thus , the sensitivity gain due to ao correction is about 0.5 mag in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the improvement of spatial resolution with ao is also significant .",
    "figure [ radfit ] shows a model fit to the surface brightness profile of a @xmath82 galaxy at @xmath83 ( `` g2 '' in figure [ ssdf_image ] ) , using a psf - convolved de vaucouleurs profile @xcite for a bulge - dominated galaxy and an exponential profile @xcite for a disk - dominated galaxy .",
    "while it was difficult to distinguish these model profiles for the seeing - limited sdf data , this galaxy is evidently a disk dominated galaxy for our ssdf data .",
    "effective radii of local galaxies , except for compact dwarf galaxies , range from @xmath321.0 kpc to @xmath32 10 kpc depending on their luminosity @xcite .",
    "since our spatial resolution of 018 corresponds to about 1.4 kpc at @xmath84 , we can determine the size as well as the morphological type even at @xmath10 .",
    "thus , our ao morphology data should enable systematic and quantitative study of rest - frame optical morphology of galaxies at @xmath10 ( minowa et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "typical ao system operated with a guide star of moderate brightness can only partially correct for turbulence - induced distortions .",
    "the partially corrected psf consists of two components : a diffraction - limited core superimposed on a seeing halo .",
    "as the strehl ratio becomes lower , which means a decrease of the degree of correction , a greater proportion of energy in the diffraction - limited core is scattered into the surrounding halo and the peak of the diffraction - limited core becomes lower . as a result , the seeing halo becomes the dominant component in the psf .",
    "for the present ssdf data with the strehl ratio of about 0.1 , since about 90% of the energy is scattered into the surrounding halo , the fwhm of the observed psf ( @xmath85 ) is broader than the diffraction - limited core ( @xmath86 in the @xmath11-band ) and the wings extended out to the seeing size are seen around the edge of the psf ( see figure [ psf_prof ] ) .",
    "the surface brightness profile of galaxies detected in the ssdf may be distorted by the extended wings of the observed psf . to estimate the effect of the extended wings of the observed psf on the flux and size measurement of the galaxies in the ssdf image",
    ", we conducted a simulation using artificial galaxies that were convolved with a model psf profile .",
    "figure [ psf_prof ] shows the radial profile of the observed psf and the fitted lines with a moffat profile and a gaussian profile .",
    "these profiles are described as    @xmath87^{-\\beta}\\ \\ ( moffat ) , \\\\",
    "i(r ) & = & \\exp\\left [ -\\ln(2 ) \\left(2r / fwhm\\right)^2\\right]\\ \\ ( gaussian),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath88 is the distance from the center of the psf , @xmath89 is the full width at half maximum of the psf and @xmath90 is the constant related to the shape of the profile .",
    "as @xmath90 decreases , the moffat profile deviates from the gaussian profile and comes to show more extended wings . for the observed psf in the ssdf , best fit parameters of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are 018 and 1.73 , respectively .",
    "we found that the moffat profile represents well the observed psf , while the gaussian profile fails to represents the extended wings of the observed psf ( see figure [ psf_prof ] ) .",
    "thus , we used the fitted moffat profile to convolve the artificial galaxies in the simulation .",
    "the artificial galaxies are created to have the typical size in the ssdf image .",
    "figure [ mag_iso_obs ] shows an isophotal area of the observed galaxies , that means the area where the surface brightness of the galaxies is brighter than the detection threshold of 23.64 mag / arcsec@xmath9 , as a function of the isophotal magnitude .",
    "we also plotted the isophotal areas of the simulated disk galaxies with @xmath91 01 , 025 , and 05 .",
    "because the sizes of the observed galaxies are roughly distributed between the size distribution of the simulated disk galaxies with 01 and 05 , we used the disk galaxy with the intermediate size of @xmath41 as the artificial galaxy that models the typical galaxies in the ssdf image . the size and morphological type of the artificial galaxies",
    "are same as the galaxy `` g1 '' , which was used to estimate the limiting magnitude and the detection completeness for galaxies ( see  4 and  5.1 ) . after we placed the artificial galaxies at random positions in the ssdf image with varying their fluxes , we measured their magnitude and isophotal area with the same technique as used for the observed galaxies .",
    "figure [ mag_mag ] shows a comparison between the model magnitude and the measured magnitude ( total and isophotal ) of the artificial galaxies .",
    "the measured total and isophotal magnitudes are almost consistent with the model magnitude within the uncertainties , although the measured magnitude of the artificial galaxies at the faint end tend to be slightly fainter than the model magnitude .",
    "thus , the extended wings of the observed psf should not affect the measurement of the magnitude of the typical galaxies in the ssdf image .",
    "figure [ mag_iso_simul](a ) shows the isophotal area of the artificial galaxies with @xmath41 as a function of the isophotal magnitude .",
    "we also show the isophotal area versus isophotal magnitude diagram for small galaxies with @xmath92 in figure [ mag_iso_simul](b ) for a comparison .",
    "to estimate the effect of the extended wings of the observed psf on the galaxy size measurement , we compared the isophotal area of the artificial galaxies convolved with the moffat profile and that convolved with the gaussian profile .",
    "both of the profiles were fitted to the observed psf .",
    "the moffat profile represents well the observed psf that have extended wings , while the gaussian profile only represents the central part of the observed psf ( see figure [ psf_prof ] ) .",
    "the isophotal areas of the @xmath93 galaxies convolved with the moffat profile are almost consistent with those convolved with the gaussian profile at all magnitude range . on the other hand ,",
    "the isophotal areas of the @xmath94 galaxies convolved with the moffat profile are larger than that convolved with the gaussian profile .",
    "these implies that the extended wings of the observed psf should not affect the isophotal area of the typical galaxies in the ssdf image , while it may affect the isophotal area of small galaxies at the bright magnitude range .",
    "the performance of ao correction degrades gradually with increasing distance from a guide star .",
    "this is due to increased decorrelation of the turbulence - induced aberration away from the location of the guide star ( angular anisoplanatism , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , spatial resolution ( thus sensitivity ) is usually highest in the region close to the guide star and decreases gradually as we go farther away from it .",
    "the angular anisoplanatism in our imaging data was evaluated from some snapshots of globular cluster m13 using ao , in which a number of stars are distributed uniformly in our 1  @xmath2 1  field of view .",
    "the snapshots were taken just after the deep imaging so that the observational condition does not change significantly ( table [ log ] ) .",
    "the ao guide star for the snapshots was selected to have the same brightness as that of the deep imaging .",
    "figure [ aniso]a shows the variation of the stellar fwhm ( spatial resolution ) with respect to the distance from the guide star .",
    "similarly , figure [ aniso]b shows the variation of the 5@xmath4 limiting magnitude with an hour integration ( sensitivity ) in the field .",
    "the stellar fwhm and the limiting magnitude deteriorate with increasing distance from the guide star .    the stellar fwhm and the 5@xmath4 limiting magnitude in the ssdf are 018 and @xmath95 with an hour integration , respectively , for the point - like source located at the distance of 24  from the guide star ( dotted line in figure [ aniso ] ) .",
    "since more than 90% of the detected galaxies in the ssdf are distributed in a range of distance from 10  to 35 , the uncertainties in measurements of the stellar fwhm and the 5@xmath4 limiting magnitude due to anisoplanatism are about @xmath33003 and @xmath330.1 mag , respectively , which should be negligible for the following discussions .",
    "figure [ numcnt ] shows our differential number counts of galaxies in the reliable magnitude range of @xmath8 , where the signal - to - noise ratio for raw counts is greater than 3 and the detection completeness for point source is more than 50% .",

    "thereby , it provides a quantitative estimate of the baryonic mass that is a fundamental quantity for galaxy formation and cosmology .",

    "the faint - end slope @xmath23 of the hdf galaxy counts @xcite is flatter than the critical slope of 0.4 , with which the contributed flux from galaxies to the ebl is constant against magnitude .",

    "@xcite performed the same analysis as ours using the sdf data taken by the subaru / cisco .",

    "<S> we present a deep @xmath0-band ( 2.12@xmath1 m ) imaging of 1 @xmath2 1  subaru super deep field ( ssdf ) taken with the subaru adaptive optics ( ao ) system . </S>",
    "<S> total integration time of 26.8 hours results in the limiting magnitude of @xmath3 ( 5@xmath4 , 02 aperture ) for point sources and @xmath5 ( 5@xmath4 , 06 aperture ) for galaxies , which is the deepest limit ever achieved in the @xmath0 band . </S>",
    "<S> the average stellar fwhm of the co - added image is 018 . </S>",
    "<S> based on the photometric measurements of detected galaxies , we obtained the differential galaxy number counts , for the first time , down to @xmath6 , which is more than 0.5 mag deeper than the previous data . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the number count slope @xmath7 is about 0.15 at @xmath8 , which is flatter than the previous data . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , detected galaxies in the ssdf have only negligible contribution to the near - infrared extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , and the discrepancy claimed so far between the diffuse ebl measurements and the estimated ebl from galaxy count integration has become more serious . </S>",
    "<S> the size distribution of detected galaxies was obtained down to the area size of less than 0.1 arcsec@xmath9 , which is less than a half of the previous data in the @xmath0 band . </S>",
    "<S> we compared the observed size - magnitude relation with a simple pure luminosity evolution model allowing for intrinsic size evolution , and found that a model with no size evolution gives the best fit to the data . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the surface brightness of galaxies at high redshift is not much different from that expected from the size - luminosity relation of present - day galaxies . </S>"
