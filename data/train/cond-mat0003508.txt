    "the mode coupling theory ( mct ) for supercooled simple liquids proposed by bengtzelius , gtze and sjlander @xcite interprets the glass transition as a dynamical transition .",
    "this picture has been supported by many experiments on several glass formers ( see e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) and more recently by detailed analysis of computer simulations for lennard - jones systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . the signature of the dynamical transition , i.e. the asymptotical power laws , have been discovered also via neutron scattering , light scattering , dielectric relaxation and nmr in _ molecular _ glassformers ( see @xcite and references therein ) , stimulating the extension of mct to molecular liquids .",
    "two approaches for such an extension have been proposed recently for rigid molecules .",
    "chong and hirata @xcite introduced a theory based on a site - site description of the molecules .",
    "their approach offers the advantage to be closely related to neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the structural information  which is a necessary input of the theory  can be readily obtained from theories of molecular liquids able to predict partial structure factors , like the rism @xcite approximation .",
    "the second approach is based on the expansion of the orientational density into a complete set of functions , in analogy to the fourier expansion of the density related to the translational degrees of freedom . to distinguish the second approach from the site - site theory ,",
    "it is called molecular mode coupling theory ( mmct ) .",
    "mmct was derived for a single linear molecule in a simple liquid @xcite , for liquids of linear molecules @xcite(for some application see @xcite ) and for molecules of arbitrary shape @xcite .",
    "mmct allows to calculate the glassy dynamics for all orientational degrees of freedom , and it is closely connected to dielectric and nmr experiments . as reorientational motion is also very important in light scattering experiments @xcite it may also be helpful in their interpretation .",
    "the connection of mmct to neutron scattering experiments has been discussed recently @xcite .",
    "the fundamental mmct quantities are the time - dependent correlation functions @xmath6 of the tensorial density modes @xmath7 here it is @xmath8 and @xmath9 runs over all positive integers including zero , @xmath10 and @xmath11 take integer values between @xmath12 and @xmath9 , @xmath13 denotes the wigner functions @xcite . the reader should note that the correlators ( [ eq : sqt ] ) are diagonal in @xmath10 for @xmath8 .",
    "the mmct equations of motion for the laplace transform @xmath14 , @xmath15 have been presented in a preceding paper . here we focus on the _ unnormalized _ molecular nonergodicity parameters @xmath16 which we calculated using the following set of equations @xcite .",
    "@xmath17^{-1 } \\label{eq : nonerg1 } \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath18    the memory function matrix @xmath19 in eq.([eq : nonerg3 ] ) represent the mode coupling approximation for the correlation function of fluctuating forces .",
    "the index @xmath20 labels the translational ( @xmath21 ) and rotational ( @xmath22 ) currents , each of them consisting of three ( spherical ) vector components @xmath23 .",
    "the vertex functions @xmath24 are determined only by the matrix of the static molecular structure factors @xmath25 and the number density @xmath26 .",
    "their explicit form has been given in ref .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 appearing in eq.([eq : nonerg2 ] ) are @xmath28 since @xmath29 ( due to the choice of @xmath8 ) the transversal translational components ( @xmath30 ) of the memory functions enter only indirectly ( via the inversion of @xmath31 ) and thus shall be neglected in the following .",
    "the given set of equations ( [ eq : nonerg1])-([eq : nonerg3 ] ) includes all interactions between translational and rotational degrees of freedom in molecular liquids and thus this set is rather involved .",
    "obviously its numerical solution poses a formidable task .    as model system for our analysis we have chosen spc / e water @xcite .",
    "the water molecule possesses a twofold rotational symmetry ( @xmath32 ) around the axis given by its dipole moment which has been chosen as the z - axis of the body fixed frame .",
    ".comparison of the critical temperatures @xmath0 for the md - simulation and the theoretical calculations in diagonal - dipole approximation , dipole - approximation and for the `` full '' theory . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the z - axis and the x - axis define the plane which is spanned by the molecule . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath32-symmetry can be used to simplify the equations of motion by the restriction that @xmath11 and @xmath33 are even .",
    "preceeding publications on long time md ",
    "simulations @xcite for this strong glass former showed that the centre of mass dynamics is in good agreement with the predictions of the asymptotic laws of mct .",
    "recent work @xcite demonstrated that the signature of the dynamic transition can also be observed for the orientational degrees of freedom of the molecule .    a first approach to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nonerg1])-([eq : nonerg3 ] ) has been given in ref .",
    "apart from the necessary truncation of the range of @xmath9 by a cutoff @xmath34 for which we have chosen @xmath1 we introduced in @xcite two more approximations . in the _ dipole approximation _ , water was treated as a linear molecule oriented in the direction of its dipole moment .",
    "this approximation corresponds to set in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nonerg1])-([eq : nonerg3 ] ) the angular indices @xmath11 , @xmath33 and the corresponding summation indices @xmath35,@xmath36 to zero . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have also studied the stronger _ diagonal - dipole approximation _ , which makes the further assumption that structure factors , nonergodicity parameters and memory functions are diagonal with respect to the angular indices @xmath9 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is the main purpose of the present communication to present results obtained by solving the _ `` full '' _ set of mmct - equations up to @xmath1 without any further approximation .",
    "the main difference to the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite is that we take the nonlinear character of the water molecule serious . in particular",
    ", this means that the rotational motion of both protons around the dipolar axis is taken into account .",
    "therefore , we can study the influence of this degree of freedom on the ideal glass transition temperature @xmath0 and on the nonergodicity parameters @xmath38 obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition we also obtain the new parameters @xmath39 with @xmath11 and/or @xmath33 different from zero .",
    "we have solved eqs . ( [ eq : nonerg1])-([eq : nonerg3 ] ) iteratively on a grid of 100 equispaced wave - vectors , up to 110.7 @xmath40 .",
    "one complete iteration requires 4 days of cpu time on a 533 mhz alpha workstation .",
    "the entire calculation to locate the critical temperature and the corresponding nonergodicity parameter , with a tolerance of @xmath41 per point , requested more than 250 iterations . on a dedicated 4-nodes parallel machine it required about 250 days .",
    "the number of iteration at the critical temperature was @xmath42 .",
    "we found that at @xmath43 the mmct equations predict a liquid phase , while at @xmath44 unambiguously a glassy state is predicted . within the chosen tolerance ,",
    "we locate @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "table [ tab : tc ] summarizes the critical temperatures at which a transition from ergodic to nonergodic behavior is found . while @xmath0 is almost equal for both approximations used in ref .",
    "@xcite and quite close to the result of the md - simulation we find that the critical temperature is overestimated by almost 50% using the `` full '' theory .",
    "thus we confirm our supposition in @xcite that the agreement for @xmath0 between simulation and both approximation schemes was fortuitous .",
    "such finding could also be expected from the static structure factors used as input . besides the dominating diagonal structure factors @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "the most prominent peaks are displayed by @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( see figures in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which were neglected in @xcite .",
    "the overestimation of the critical temperature is common to the mct for simple liquids @xcite and seems to be a general deficiency of the mode coupling approximation .",
    "thus we see that  although the overestimation of the critical temperature is not desired  it is necessary to include all static structure factors with large amplitude to get a concise description in the mmct framework .",
    "figure [ fig : com ] shows the comparison of the _ unnormalized _ critical nonergodicity parameters @xmath51 for the centre of mass correlations .",
    "the oscillations of the md - result are captured well by all of our mmct - results . as for the critical temperature we can also observe for the critical nonergodicity parameters that the dipole approximation and the diagonal - dipole approximation lead to nearly the same result . in the vicinity of the maximum of the structure factor",
    "the agreement between theory and simulation is improved by removing the additional approximations but for the prepeak as well as for large @xmath52 both approximation schemes perform better than the `` full '' theory . in the region of the prepeak and especially for the minimum between prepeak and main peak we observe that the oscillations are less pronounced and the peak positions are slightly shifted .",
    "exactly the same behaviour can be found by a comparison of the static structure factors at the different critical temperatures .",
    "thus the worse performance of the `` full '' theory in comparison with the approximation schemes can be attributed at least partly to the overestimation of the critical temperature because of which the static input of the calculations does not reflect accurately the static structure at the `` true '' @xmath0 of the simulation .",
    "apart from that , it also has to be taken into account that in spite of the computational effort we have made , the fixed point of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonerg1])-([eq : nonerg3 ] ) can not be determined with very high precision .",
    "therefore , the result for the critical nonergodicity parameters after 54 iterations may overestimate the exact one by a few percent . the latter reason may also be responsible for the worse performance of the `` full '' theory at the minima of @xmath51 as nauroth @xcite found that the convergence of the iteration is extremely slow in these parts .",
    "finally we want to mention that the disagreement at large @xmath52 between simulation and _ all _ theoretical calculations was also found for simple liquids @xcite and was considered as a shortcoming of the mode coupling approximation .    as in the case of the centre of mass correlators the @xmath52-dependence of the nonergodicity parameters @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fmx10xp10 ] ) is reproduced well by the theory . here even in the vicinity of the maximum",
    "the approximations perform better than the `` full '' theory . figure [ fig : fmx20xp20 ] shows the comparison for the critical nonergodicity parameters @xmath54 .",
    "apart from the region of large wave vectors the `` full '' theory shows better agreement with the simulation than the two approximations .",
    "thus one observes that the approximations , which neglect terms with @xmath55 and consequently @xmath56 , have stronger effect on the @xmath57-correlators than on those for @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "further one observes that the agreement between theory and simulation is less good for the @xmath57correlators than for those with @xmath59 or @xmath58 .",
    "the reader should note that the good agreement at large @xmath52 for the @xmath57correlators must be considered as fortuitous because the overestimation of the nonergodicity parameters ( seen for @xmath60 ) is compensated by a generally too small amplitude of the @xmath57correlators .",
    "the reason for the worse agreement of the @xmath57correlators is their higher sensibility to the cutoff at @xmath1 which can be understood on a mathematical level by a closer examination of the vertices which have been given in ref .",
    "let us pick out one special example to illustrate this point .",
    "the vertex factor @xmath61 is responsible for the coupling of two correlators involving @xmath59 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "it is of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 contains clebsch - gordan coefficients of the form @xmath64 which enforces @xmath57 .",
    "therefore the contribution to the memory function matrix caused by the vertex factor in eq .",
    "( [ vert02 ] ) is exact even for @xmath1 .",
    "the vertex factor @xmath65 instead , which describes the coupling of two correlators involving @xmath57 and @xmath57 , respectively , has the form @xmath66 the corresponding clebsch - gordan coefficient @xmath67 allows @xmath68 .",
    "thus for @xmath1 this vertex is not entirely taken into acount , although it is responsible for the coupling of @xmath57-correlations . from this example",
    "we can see that the @xmath57-quantities are more sensitive to the cutoff than those for @xmath59 .",
    "the _ off diagonal _ critical nonergodicity parameters with @xmath3 shown in figure [ fig : fdipol ] are reproduced well by the theory .",
    "the difference between dipole - approximation and `` full '' theory are relatively small .",
    "figures [ fig : fn2diag ] and [ fig : fn2nondiag ] show the comparison between the new critical nonergodicity parameters with @xmath55 and/or @xmath69 and the simulation results .",
    "since those terms    are neglected by the approximations they can only be calculated using the `` full '' set of mmct - equations .",
    "the agreement between theory and simulation is satisfactory for almost all correlators . in the discussion of the _ unnormalized _ critical nonergodicity parameters",
    "we have seen that the worse performance of the `` full '' theory is partly due to the fact that the static input has to be taken at the `` wrong '' temperature .",
    "this influences the nonergodicity parameters in two ways : @xmath70 @xmath25 is the initial value of the correlation function @xmath71 whose limit for @xmath72 are the _",
    "unnormalized _ nonergodicity parameters @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath73 in the mode coupling approximation the static structure factors determine the vertices which describe the coupling between the tensorial density modes in the system .",
    "this influence can partly be eliminated by calculating the _ normalized _ critical nonergodicity parameters @xmath74    a selection of the normalized diagonal nonergodicity parameters is shown in fig.([fig : fm0x00xp00])-([fig : fmx20xp20 ] ) . due to the normalization",
    "the variation with @xmath52 is less pronounced .",
    "we observe that the difference in amplitude between the `` full '' theory and the approximations is reduced as the initial value @xmath75 of the time - dependent correlation functions is set to 1 at all wavevectors and all temperatures .",
    "nonetheless the dipole and diagonal - dipole approximation still provide the better description of the normalized critical nonergodicity parameter .    in part this may be explained by the better convergence of the iteration for the approximation schemes , but the wrong critical temperature also has its influence as can be seen from the fact that the peak positions for the `` full '' mmct results are still slightly shifted .",
    "from our analysis we can state the following conclusions : _ i ) _ the mode coupling theory for molecular liquids overestimates the critical temperature @xmath0 in the same fashion as its counterpart for simple liquids . _",
    "ii ) _ the @xmath52-dependence of the critical nonergodicity parameters is well reproduced in the vicinity of the main peaks .",
    "systematic differences exist for large wave vectors . _",
    "iii ) _ deviations between theory and simulation are partly due to the overestimation of the critical temperature .",
    "therfore the structural input of the theory does not reflect properly the structure of the liquid at the true glass transition temperature . these deviations still exist for the normalized nonergodicity parameters . _",
    "iv ) _ approximation schemes taking into account only part of the correlators like the dipole and the diagonal - dipole approximation can already give a reasonable description .",
    "_ v ) _ the essential correlation functions can be selected on the basis of the static structure factors .",
    "i.e. for supercooled water the most important static correlator are those with @xmath76 and/or @xmath77 and for @xmath3 those , which are diagonal in @xmath9 and @xmath37 .",
    "we think that in combination with suitable approximations for the static structure factors mmct will be a useful tool in the understanding of the glass transition in molecular liquids .",
    "the solution of the `` full '' set of mmct equations is still a formidable task with present day computers , but approximation schemes can be constructed on the basis of the importance of various static structure factors .",
    "a reduction to the most prominent correlators and @xmath52-vectors offers the possibility to construct _ microscopically based _",
    "schematic models for the description of molecular liquids .",
