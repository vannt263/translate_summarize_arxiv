    "for years , extensive studies have been carried out on the coronal heating problem .",
    "the hot corona lies above the cool photosphere @xcite , which can not be explained by thermal processes .",
    "instead the mechanical energy injection from the surface convection motion is expected to maintain the hot corona by means of magnetic field .",
    "the coupling between the convection and the magnetic field transports free magnetic energy that will be converted to thermal energy in the upper atmosphere . to resolve the coronal heating problem",
    ", we should specify the physics that are responsible for releasing the free magnetic energy .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the atmosphere above the solar pole where the fast solar wind emanates .",
    "the magnetic field lines above the solar pole open up to the interplanetary space .",
    "one of the most plausible carriers of the magnetic free energy in the open field region is alfvn waves , which was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "recent observations have been accumulating several pieces of evidence of the existence of the propagating alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere @xcite . propagation and",
    "dissipation of alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere is quite complicated since the gravity and the magnetic field make highly inhomogeneous atmospheres .",
    "for 1 dimensional configuration , nonlinear steepening of alfvn waves and the subsequent shock formation play an important role in wave dissipation @xcite .",
    "plenty of wave modes will emerge when we consider two dimensional configuration @xcite .",
    "all the above numerical simulations adopt simplified energy equation . in the coronal loop ,",
    "mechanical heating is balanced by the radiative cooling and thermal conduction .",
    "enthalpy flux due to the existence of the solar wind is also important when we consider the open field structure @xcite .",
    "therefore in order to obtain the atmospheric structure above the solar pole , we should treat the corona and the solar wind in a self - consistent way .",
    "one of the most important aspects of the self - consistent models is that these models can determine the mass loss rate from the sun given the boundary condition at the surface .",
    "if we can construct the appropriate mass loss model from the sun , the model could be very useful even for the stellar or the planetary atmospheres .",
    "pioneering works by @xcite treated the corona and the solar wind simultaneously in a self - consistent way . instead of using the artificial heating function , @xcite adopted the physically based heating model from phenomenological turbulent theories .",
    "heating models based on acoustic shocks @xcite and mhd shocks @xcite are also investigated .",
    "time steady condition is relaxed to demonstrate the self - consistent reproduction of the hot coronal wind with fully dynamical 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite ( hereafter referred to as ms12 ) mhd simulations .",
    "ms12 suggested that the shock heating is dominant heating mechanisms in the chromosphere and the coronal bottom while the turbulent heating is important in the solar wind acceleration region .",
    "however , there are two problems in the way how ms12 estimate the heating rate in their simulation .",
    "first , ms12 used dimensional analysis based on turbulent theory when they estimate the incompressible heating rate .",
    "this method can include large uncertainty , which allows ms12 only to estimate the order of magnitude of the heating rate .",
    "second , the dimensional analysis does not have ability to estimate the temporal and spatial variability of the heating rate . in order to overcome the problems in ms12 ,",
    "we have developed an alternative method to estimate the heating rate .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to describe more detailed features on heating mechanisms by using the new estimation method .",
    "moreover , we will describe detailed dynamic features which are not shown in ms12 .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : model ] by describing our numerical models and corresponding assumptions .",
    "the time - averaged quasi - steady solution is shown in section [ sec : solution ] while the dynamic features relating to the coupling between waves and the transition region shall be discussed in section [ sec : dynamics ] . then the basic idea to derive the heating rate as a function of space and time",
    "is given in section [ sec : data_analysis ] , although the detailed method for discretization and test simulations are explained in appendix [ app : method ] . in section [ sec : heating ] , we shall show the total amount and the spatial distribution of heating rate and discuss the possible mechanisms that actually happened in the numerical simulation .",
    "we continue in section [ sec : discussion ] by discussing the validity of the heating mechanisms found in our numerical simulation , while in section [ sec : summary ] we summarize .",
    "all the numerical methods to integrate the basic equations in this paper are the same as that used in ms12 .",
    "we will describe the method in more detailed way here . throughout the paper",
    ", we will assume single fluid mhd to describe a flux tube extended from the photosphere to the interplanetary space .",
    "although the photosphere and the chromosphere are partially ionized , the use of single fluid approximation can be justified by frequent collisions between protons and neutrals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "above the upper corona ( @xmath0 or 7.0@xmath110@xmath2 mm ) , proton and electron will decouple due to weak collisionality . even in that case",
    ", we continue to use single fluid mhd equations for simplicity .",
    "since we do not include any explicit dissipation terms in our equations , all the dissipations come from shocks and discretization errors .",
    "the method to estimate the heating rate shall be discussed in section [ sec : data_analysis ] .",
    "in addition to ideal mhd formulation , we include the gravity from the sun .",
    "the solar gravity produces a highly stratified atmosphere , which inevitably leads initially linear waves to nonlinear waves .",
    "we consider a flux tube at @xmath3 in the spherical coordinate .",
    "we rotate the axis of the spherical coordinate so that the pole of the spherical coordinate lies on the equator of the sun .",
    "this helps us to avoid the numerical difficulty in the polar region of the spherical coordinate when we treat polar region of the sun .",
    "we neglect rotation of the sun as well as macro - scale magnetic field in this study .",

    "the alfvn speed along the central axis of the flux tube is generally larger than its surroundings .",
    "even when the initial alfvn wave front is straight in @xmath7 direction , the central part of the wave front tends to propagate faster than the off axis part .",
    "this leads to the curved wedge or convex shape of the alfvn wave front , as was demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "this inhomogeneous alfvnic disturbance creates the radial velocity through the nonlinear mode conversion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , only the phase speed in alfvnic fluctuations increases just above the magnetic canopy .",
    "since the super radial decrease in the magnetic field strength is suppressed just above the canopy by the surrounding flux tubes , alfvn speed increases exponentially according to the decrease in the mass density .",

    "the injected alfvn wave has already been nonlinearly steepened into the fast shock to have small length scale in radial direction before they collide with the transition region .",

    "the shock front refracts significantly because of the huge difference in phase speed across the transition region .",
    "when the chromospheric fast shock hits the transition region , the chromospheric fast shock would split into an out - going fast / slow shock , a contact discontinuity ( can be seen as spicules ) and an in - going fast rarefaction wave . since the mach numbers of the fast shock are so small that we could not see the shocks clearly .",

    "the resultant alfvn wave has an elongated wedge shape structure shown in figure [ fig : heating_above_tr]c .",

    "the alfvn wave has large current density along the wave front that can be dissipated to heat the coronal bottom .",
    "the concave structure of the transition region can also be important because it produces the steep gradient of alfvn speed not only in vertical direction but also in horizontal direction .",
    "the strong inhomogeneity in horizontal direction can proceed the so called phase mixing of alfvn waves .",
    "we think the phase mixing just above the transition region stimulates the coronal heating in our simulation .",
    "the acoustic heating rate is also important at @xmath162 @xmath24 ( 30 mm ) the acoustic heating originates from the shock waves that are formed in the chromosphere and injected to the coronal bottom @xcite .          in the solar wind acceleration region ( @xmath163 or 7@xmath110@xmath2 mm ) , incompressible heating mechanisms are dominant .",

    "the rest of @xmath138 is referred to as the incompressible component .",
    "the incompressible component exceeds the compressible component above @xmath164 @xmath24 ( 21 mm )",
    ". therefore the plasma heating in the solar wind are dissipation of magnetic energy through incompressible process , although the heating is done through numerical dissipation .",
    "extension to 3d could be essential in terms of the property of mhd turbulence in the solar wind .",
    "reduced mhd that excludes the compressibility from the usual mhd is useful approach for mhd turbulence in the solar wind and extensive studies have been done in the reduced mhd formulation so far @xcite .",
    "although the compressibility turns out not to contribute the total heating rate directly , it produces large density fluctuations that could change the reflection rate of alfvn waves .",
    "since the efficiency of mhd turbulence depends on the amount of the reflection waves , the compressibility could affect the total heating rate indirectly .",
    "thanks to the new analysis method described in section [ sec : data_analysis ] and appendix [ app : method ] , we can derive more accurate profile of the heating rate than that was reported by ms12 . although the numerical simulation shown here is almost the same as that of ms12 , the new analysis method and higher numerical resolution lead us two different interpretations about heating mechanisms in the corona .",
    "first , ms12 suggested that the shock dissipation and mhd turbulence are the main heating mechanisms at the coronal bottom .",
    "we concluded that , instead of mhd turbulence , alfvn waves with curved wedge shape originate from the chromospheric fast shocks is main heating mechanisms at the coronal bottom .",
    "phase mixing due to the concave transition region may also stimulate the coronal heating .",
    "the heating rate derived in this paper is more reliable than that of ms12 .",
    "next , ms12 suggested that mhd turbulence is the dominant heating mechanisms in the solar wind .",
    "the finer radial resolution reveals that we do not achieve the shallower power spectrum like kolmogorov - type turbulence .",
    "we confirm that the magnetic energy are converted to the thermal energy through incompressible processes , although it is difficult to distinguish what kind of heating mechanisms operate in the solar wind .",
    "we derive heating rate in our numerical simulation that inevitably has numerical dissipation larger than that of the realistic solar atmosphere .",
    "therefore we should discuss the validity or the robustness of the heating mechanisms found in our simulations , although we do need further numerical experiments to investigate whether our results depend on numerical resolution .",
    "shock heating rate would not depend on the grid size and microscopic physics like viscosity or resistivity as far as rankine - hugoniot relations are satisfied .",
    "since our numerical scheme ( hlld scheme ) is conservative and meditated to capture mhd shocks , the shock heating in our numerical simulation should not be just a numerical heating but a physical one .",
    "heating events at the coronal bottom are associated with curved wedge shape structure described in section [ sec : heating ] .",
    "this structure would be alfvn wave front with large current density that was stored in the chromospheric fast shocks . whether this structure keeps large current density or not might depend on the numerical resolution .",
    "the dynamic simulations with high resolution are needed to justify this heating mechanism .",
    "the heating by phase mixing depends on viscosity or resistivity so that our results could be affected by numerical resolution .",
    "the phase mixing in our simulation turns on because of the horizontal phase speed difference that is created by the collision between the transition region and shock waves .",
    "then the duration that phase mixing operates is finite and determined by the alfvn crossing time between peaks and troughs of the transition region .",
    "the finite duration for phase mixing results in the finite thickness of the current density .",
    "therefore this will prevent phase mixing from cascading to the dissipation scale that is determined by microscopic physics , although , in our simulation , alfvn waves dissipate due to insufficient grid numbers in @xmath7 direction .",
    "therefore there is a possibility that the phase mixing discussed here may be weaken to operate if we increase grid numbers .",
    "extension to 3 dimensional simulation could stimulate phase mixing by increasing the effective viscosity or resistivity through instability due to velocity or magnetic field shear . or inhomogeneity in @xmath4 direction makes phase mixing less effective as was suggested by @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "we only consider shear alfvn fluctuations ( @xmath78 ) as the energy injection from the photosphere .",
    "however the realistic fluctuations would also be associated with kink and torsional types in the complex solar atmosphere without translational symmetry ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "torsional alfvn waves could be generated by the vortex flows observed in the photosphere @xcite , and the connection between the vortex flows and swirling motions in the upper atmosphere are observed recently @xcite . since the difference in nonlinear behaviors between torsional and shear mode",
    "is discussed by , dynamic behaviors could be affected if we include torsional alfvn waves .",
    "this aspect will be explored in future work by using axisymetric 2.5 dimensional simulations or full 3 dimensional simulations .",
    "since we only prescribe alfvnic fluctuations that can not be linearly converted into compressible mode , the nonlinear development of alfvn waves is important to heat the atmosphere .",
    "the wave nonlinearity @xmath165 is proportional to @xmath166 if we consider the wave energy flux conservation in an static atmosphere , @xmath167 const , where @xmath85 is the cross section of the flux tube .",
    "this means that not only the density structure but also the expansion rate of the magnetic field are important for the development of the wave nonlinearity .",
    "the previous 1 dimensional simulations artificially defined the cross section of flux tubes .",
    "the magnetic field in our model has nearly the potential field structure similar to that in @xcite , which makes our simulation more realistic than the 1 dimensional simulations . our model ,",
    "however , can not describe the non - magnetic atmosphere below the magnetic canopy , since potential field structure needs the surrounding magnetic pressure to support the strong magnetic flux tube . for more realistic simulation",
    ", we should implement the magnetohydrostatic atmosphere in the similar way @xcite did to investigate the compressible wave propagation .    from the chromospheric observations with hinode / sot , @xcite suggested that there are two types of spicules : type i spicules exhibit up - and - down motion and have relatively slow ascending speed while type ii spicules fade out and often have high speed upward motion larger than 100 km s@xmath60 .",
    "if we regard the up - and - down motion of the transition region as spicules , the radial velocity of our spicules is usually 60 km s@xmath60 at most .",
    "therefore the collision between shock waves and the transition region could not lift up the plasma so rapidly as type ii spicules do and other mechanisms will be needed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it should be noted however that the existence of the type ii spicules is still under debate so far @xcite .",
    "we have implemented a 2.5 dimensional mhd simulation that resolves the propagation and the dissipation of the alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the hot corona and the high speed solar wind are reproduced as a natural consequence of the alfvn wave injection from the photosphere , as was shown in ms12 . however , the detailed analysis of the heating rate leads us to the different interpletation as follows .    * alfvn waves with curved wedge shape generated by the chromospheric fast shocks heat the coronal bottom while ms12 suggested heating by mhd turbulence . *",
    "anisotropic turbulent cascade that was found in the simulation of ms12 turned out to disappear when increasing radial resolution .",
