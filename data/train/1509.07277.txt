    "it is known since the 80 s that vector fields defined on a vector space @xmath2 ( or more generally a riemannian manifold ) , which commute with the action of a group @xmath3 of isometries of @xmath2 , can possess invariant sets which are structurally stable ( within their @xmath3 symmetry class ) and which are composed of a sequence of saddle equilibria @xmath4 and a sequence of trajectories @xmath5 , such that @xmath5 belong to the unstable manifold of @xmath6 as well as to the stable manifold of @xmath7 for all @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "these objects are called _ robust heteroclinic cycles _ and under certain conditions they can be asymptotically attracting .",
    "robust heteroclinic cycles have been considerably studied in low - dimensional vector spaces @xcite .",
    "although their properties and classification are well established in @xmath10 , the case of @xmath0 appears to be much richer and yet not completely investigated . in @xcite",
    "the so - called _ simple _ robust heteroclinic cycles were introduced , which can be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the isotropy subgroup of an equilibrium @xmath12 .",
    "the heteroclinic cycle is simple if ( i ) the fixed point subspace of @xmath11 , denoted @xmath13 , is an axis ; ( ii ) for each @xmath14 , @xmath12 is a saddle and @xmath15 is a sink in an invariant plane @xmath16 ( hence @xmath17 ) ; ( iii ) the isotypic decomposition for the action of @xmath11 in the tangent space at @xmath12 only contains one - dimensional components . in @xcite",
    "we have found all finite groups @xmath18o(4 ) _ admitting _ simple heteroclinic cycles ( i.e. for which there exists an open set of @xmath3-equivariant vector fields possessing such an invariant set ) .",
    "we have also pointed out that the definition of a simple heteroclinic cycle in former works @xcite had omitted condition ( iii ) , which was implicitly assumed .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , then the behaviour of the heteroclinic cycle turns out to be more complex , because there exists at least one equilibrium @xmath6 at which the unstable manifold is two dimensional and , moreover , is invariant under a faithful action of the dihedral group @xmath19 for some @xmath20 .",
    "we called heteroclinic cycles satisfying ( i ) and ( ii ) but not ( iii ) _ pseudo - simple_.    the aim of the present work is to investigate the dynamical properties of pseudo - simple heteroclinic cycles in @xmath0 .",
    "we shall therefore consider equations of the form @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a smooth map in @xmath0 , and which possess a pseudo - simple cycle .",
    "our main result stated in theorem 1 , section [ sec : instabso(4 ) ] , is that if @xmath18 so(4 ) , then the pseudo - simple cycle is _",
    "completely unstable_. namely , there exists a neighborhood of the heteroclinic cycle such that any solution with initial condition in this neighborhood , except in a subset of zero measure , leaves it in a finite time @xcite .",
    "then we aim at analysing more deeply what the asymptotic dynamics can be in a neighbourhood of the heteroclinic cycle .",
    "we do this by focusing on specific examples . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we introduce a subgroup of so(4 ) which is algebraically elementary , however possessing enough structure to allow for the existence of pseudo - simple heteroclinic cycles .",
    "this group is a ( reducible ) representation of the dihedral group @xmath23 .",

    "we show that when the unstable double eigenvalue is small , an attracting periodic orbit can exist in the vicinity of the @xmath3-orbit of the heteroclinic cycle , the distance between the two invariant sets vanishes as the unstable eigenvalue tends to zero .",
    "this result is numerically illustrated by building an explicit third order system for which a pseudo - simple cycle exists . in the next section [ sec : nonso(4 ) ] we extend the group @xmath3 by adding a generator which is a reflection in @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting group is isomorphic to @xmath27 and possesses the same properties for the existence of a pseudo - simple cycle .",
    "we show that in this case the cycle is not completely unstable anymore , but _ asymptotically fragmentarily stable _",
    "@xcite instead .",
    "this means that the cycle is not asymptotically stable , however in its any small neighbourhood there exists a set of positive measure , such that any solution with initial condition in that set remains in this neighbourhood for all @xmath28 and converges to the cycle as @xmath29 .",
    "this result is then illustrated numerically .",
    "+ in section [ sec : otherexample ] we present another example of a group in so(4 ) admitting pseudo - simple cycles with a more complex group structure and acting irreducibly on @xmath0 .",
    "the theorem of existence of nearby stable periodic orbits proven in section [ sec4 ] holds true for the same reasons as in the @xmath23 case .",
