    "understanding the real - time dynamics of large strongly coupled quantum systems is a challenge that affects many areas of physics . in particular , simulations of the real - time path integral on classical computers suffer from severe complex action problems , which prevent the application of importance sampling underlying quantum monte carlo @xcite . since the unitary time evolution of large isolated quantum systems may lead into paradoxical schrdinger - cat - like states , it seems unlikely that their behavior can be captured by classical computation .",
    "quantum simulators , i.e.  special purpose digital @xcite or analog @xcite quantum computers , are emerging as promising new tools that , thanks to their quantum hardware , do not suffer from sign or complex action problems .",
    "they can thus be used to address systems for which no `` classical '' solution of the sign problem has been found .",
    "quantum simulators have been constructed in atomic and condensed matter physics @xcite , and more recently also in a particle physics context @xcite .",
    "since quantum simulators are not yet readily available for most systems , it is interesting to ask what aspects of real - time quantum dynamics can be captured by simulations using classical computers .",
    "first of all , a lot of progress has been made for gapped systems with moderate entanglement in one spatial dimension . in this case , the matrix product states underlying the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite provide a basis for simulating the real - time evolution over moderate time intervals @xcite . for large higher - dimensional quantum systems",
    ", on the other hand , no unbiased computational method exists for addressing real - time dynamics .",
    "purely dissipative dynamics driven by a lindblad process , in which the hamiltonian is discarded , plays an important role for state preparation of ultracold atom systems @xcite .",
    "dissipation can also serve as a resource for quantum computation @xcite and for entanglement generation @xcite . recently",
    ", some severe sign problems have been solved for strongly interacting 2-dimensional quantum spin systems that are entirely driven by their coupling to a dissipative environment @xcite .",
    "the lindblad processes simulated so far can also be interpreted as sporadic randomized measurement processes , for example , of the total spin of a nearest - neighbor spin pair .",
    "a lindblad dynamics with hermitean quantum jump operators , which is equivalent to a measurement process , ultimately leads to a featureless infinite temperature density matrix . in spite of this",
    ", the corresponding heating process leads far out of thermal equilibrium and is interesting to investigate .",
    "in particular , depending on the dissipative process , some physical quantities like the total magnetization or staggered magnetization may be conserved . in that case , the thermalization of certain magnetization fourier modes is slowed down @xcite , and the transport of the conserved quantity is governed by a diffusion process .",
    "the flow of magnetization or staggered magnetization between a ferro- and an antiferromagnetic reservoir , occupying two initially separated parts of the volume , has been studied in @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate lindblad processes for fermions , with linear or quadratic quantum jump operators .",
    "again , we study purely dissipative dynamics driven by the interaction with an environment , not by a hamiltonian . even in euclidean time , fermion simulations are often challenging . due to fermi statistics ,",
    "negative signs enter the fermion path integral and may prevent the application of importance sampling . in such cases ,",
    "a severe fermion sign problem arises . in specific cases , in particular at half - filling , integrating out the fermions",
    "may lead to a non - negative fermion determinant , such that monte carlo is applicable .",
    "in other cases , for example , in the repulsive hubbard model away from half - filling or in lattice qcd at non - zero baryon density , a severe sign problem prevents numerical investigations from first principles .",
    "still , in some interesting cases , severe fermion sign problems have been solved , for example , using the meron - cluster algorithm @xcite or the fermion bag approach @xcite .",
    "fermion simulations in real time are particularly challenging , because one encounters both the fermion sign problem and the complex weight problem characteristic for real - time processes .",
    "it is known that for some hermitean jump operators , analytic expressions for some correlations can be found in bosonic and fermionic systems and criteria for when this is possible have been developed @xcite .",
    "steady states for some of the correlations , specifically for dissipative one - dimensional noninteracting spin systems , have been found @xcite .",
    "here we identify specific fermionic lindblad processes , with linear or quadratic quantum jump operators , for which analytic expressions for the real - time evolution of certain observables may be obtained , and we analyze their behavior . as an example , we use the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model to generate a correlated initial fermion density matrix , but the results are more general and would be applicable to any pure state or a more general density matrix .    at low temperature , the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian leads to a staggered occupation of fermions on a bipartite lattice .",
    "the real - time process , which is driven entirely by the lindblad dynamics ( and not by the hamiltonian ) , leads to an exponentially fast destruction of the staggered occupation order . in the case of quadratic quantum jump operators ,",
    "we investigate the dependence of the exponential decay rate on the lattice geometry . as with the quantum spin systems studied in @xcite , the thermalization of some fourier modes of the fermion density",
    "is slowed down due to fermion number conservation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we set up the system of fermions , and in section 3 we analytically investigate dissipative fermion dynamics with linear quantum jump operators .",
    "processes driven by quadratic quantum jump operators are studied in section 3 .",
    "finally , section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "we begin with the lindblad equation , which describes the evolution of a density matrix in real - time , assuming the process is markovian : @xmath2 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon }     \\sum_{\\{\\nu , n\\ } } \\left(l_{\\nu , n } \\rho l_{\\nu , n}^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2 } l_{\\nu , n}^\\dagger l_{\\nu , n } \\rho - \\frac{1}{2 } \\rho l_{\\nu , n}^\\dagger l_{\\nu , n}\\right ) . \\label{lindbladeq}\\ ] ] the @xmath3 operators are _ lindblad operators _ , or quantum jump operators , which provide an effective description of how the external environment acts on the quantum system under study .",
    "this equation gives the time - evolution equation of the quantum system with the presence of the hamiltonian and the environment .",
    "this is the most general trace - preserving equation for the density matrix for the quantum system under study that excludes the back - reaction of the quantum system onto itself .",
    "there are @xmath4 types of lindblad operators in ( [ lindbladeq ] ) , and each type has @xmath5 possible degree of freedom labels . in our examples to come , each @xmath5 will be a spatial site label or a nearest neighbor pair label .",
    "in general the lindblad operators may be completely arbitrary , and thus would not be normalized , but in all of our examples they obey the relation @xmath6 the constant @xmath7 is the coefficient of the lindblad operators and has the physical significance of indicating the strength of the coupling of the environment to the system per unit time . in dimensionless units , it can be expressed as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is real time .",
    "the constant @xmath10 is the number of degree of freedom labels that the operators have , and @xmath11 is an arbitrary step in real time  it is possible to take the limit @xmath12 smoothly , and define everything in in continuous real time .",
    "we normalize the lindblad operators according to ( [ nor ] ) because doing so simplifies the expressions we will be using below . for this analysis",
    ", we will consider purely dissipative systems , i.e. , the hamiltonian will be switched off , @xmath13 , for the real - time part of the evolution .",
    "we will at times assume an initial correlated density matrix for a bipartite lattice , formed using the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian , @xmath14,\\ ] ] at low temperature . other times we will use a completely staggered pure state as the initial state , consisting of particles on the even sites and holes on the odd sites .",
    ".observables referenced in this paper .",
    "@xmath15 , where @xmath16 give the number of lattice points in directions @xmath17 respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we may measure the amount of order present in the system using the observable @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is @xmath20 for one sublattice and @xmath21 for the other . other useful observables that will be referenced in this paper are given in table [ table : tab ] .",
    "to represent the real time , we use the variable @xmath9 ( not to be confused with the tight - binding constant @xmath0 ) . introducing an operator @xmath22 , for a chain of lindblad operators , @xmath23 the average observable as a function of real - time",
    "is then given by @xmath24 here the sum over @xmath25 indicates a summation over all possible @xmath26 combinations , as well as a sum over all possible @xmath27 combinations for ( all possible ) @xmath28 insertions .",
    "the last line in ( [ obs ] ) defines @xmath29 .",
    "the simplified denominator may be obtained using the identity @xmath30 .",
    "we see that indeed the real - time part of the denominator will simplify in the following way : @xmath31 here we note that ( [ obs ] ) holds only if the normalization condition ( [ nor ] ) for the lindblad operators is met .",
    "otherwise we would need one additional type of insertion , the krauss operator @xmath32 to ensure full normalization .",
    "we note in passing that our integral approach is more suited to simulations .",
    "analytical results may also be obtained by solving the equivalent differential equation for the real - time evolution for the operators in real - time , given by @xmath33 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\nu , n } { \\rm tr}\\left[\\left(l^\\dagger_{\\nu , n } \\left[o , l_{\\nu , n}\\right ] + \\left[l^\\dagger_{\\nu , n } , o\\right ] l_{\\nu , n}\\right ) \\rho\\right]$ ] , which holds for any set of lindblad operators , normalized or not",
    ".    we will now consider several sets of lindblad operators for which the numerator may also be summed analytically .",
    "the first set of linear quantum jump operators will be limited to one site for each operator , and the second set involves nearest neighbor pairs on the lattice .",
    "we also note that according to @xcite it is possible to find analytic solutions for linear fermionic lindblad operators .",
    "this knowledge , however does not tell us what to expect in particular for the steady state behavior at large times for each linear lindblad system .",
    "we consider the following two types of operators : @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the lattice site index .",
    "the operators obey the relation @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of sites and @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath37 plays the part of @xmath10 in equations ( [ obs ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath39 is the probability per unit time for each jump that these operators initiate .",
    "the surprising result is that for some observables the real - time portion of the numerator may also be summed analytically .",
    "we let @xmath40 and consider @xmath41 when @xmath42 , @xmath43 commutes with the lindblad operators and the result is clearly @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 from here we can see that @xmath47 and thus the sum in the numerator of ( [ obs ] ) is @xmath48 therefore , we see that the following holds : @xmath49 we conclude that the speed of the decay for the order parameter in the system is exponential in time .",
    "the lattice size and geometry are irrelevant to the speed of the decay , with only the @xmath39 constant determining it . using the same techniques",
    ", we can find an analytic value for the real - time evolution of another average observable , the staggered susceptibility @xmath50 , defined in table [ table : tab ] . in real - time",
    ", we can write @xmath51 , where @xmath52 from here we can see that the dominant behavior is a decay at twice the rate of that for the staggered magnetization , as expected .",
    "finally , we can also get an analytic expression for the evolution of the fourier modes , @xmath53 and structure factors @xmath54 . from the previous proof , it follows directly that @xmath55 and so the decay rates are independent of mode .",
    "the second set of linear lindblad operators consists of , @xmath56 here @xmath35 and @xmath57 are nearest neighbors , the index @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is counted as a separate operator from @xmath60",
    ". there are @xmath37 sites total in the lattice , and we use @xmath61 to denote the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "the lindblad condition holds : @xmath62 = \\mu^2 \\frac{nm}{2}\\cdot \\mathbbm{1 } .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are @xmath63 nearest neighbor pairs , so the @xmath10 constant in equation ( [ obs ] ) is @xmath64 . using @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", we find @xmath67 where again the @xmath4 variable runs over @xmath68 . with this result",
    ", we may now calculate the more comprehensive sum , @xmath69 = \\mu^2 \\left(\\frac{m n}{2 } - m\\right ) o_k .\\ ] ] and so there is an analytic expression for the real - time evolution of @xmath70 , given by @xmath71 the rate of decay is proportional to the number of nearest neighbors per site in the lattice geometry .",
    "similarly , we can show that the staggered susceptibility goes as @xmath72 finally , the more general fourier modes and structure factors for the square lattice evolve in a straightforward generalized way of how the staggered magnetization and staggered susceptibility evolve , as @xmath73 and @xmath74 as in the last set of linear lindblad operators , there is no special @xmath75-dependence in the decay rate of these fourier modes .",
    "we now turn to a set of quadratic lindblad operators , @xmath76 here @xmath35 and @xmath57 are nearest neighbors , and this time @xmath60 is counted as the same operator as @xmath59 . again the lattice has @xmath37 sites and there are @xmath61 nearest neighbors per site . there are thus @xmath77 unique site labels total .",
    "these operators satisfy the condition : @xmath78 for this set of operators , there is the following interesting result : @xmath79 from here , we may sum over all @xmath80 to find that @xmath81 from here again it is possible to extract the real - time evolution of @xmath70 , as @xmath82 and the rate of decay is proportional to the number of nearest neighbors in the lattice .",
    "this result is similar to that for the nearest neighbor linear operators , but we encounter more complexity in the fourier modes , the susceptibility , and the structure factors .",
    "the fourier modes still are described by a simple expression and are given ( for @xmath83 ) by @xmath84 on the other hand , finding the staggered susceptibility is more complicated . in the previous examples of linear operators ,",
    "@xmath85 would remain proportional to itself once we summed over all the sites for the three possible lindblad insertions , but for the quadratic operators , there is mixing between @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 connects a site to one of its nearest neighbors .",
    "the way forward is to find a way to write the susceptibility in terms of operators that remain proportional to themselves when the three possible lindblad insertions are summed over .",
    "we define a coefficient vector @xmath88 with entries @xmath89 , where each @xmath89 represents the coefficient of a particular @xmath85 term .",
    "we could start then with a vector consisting of all ones , and this would represent the uniform susceptibility observable @xmath90 .",
    "we then construct a matrix @xmath91 such that @xmath92 is a new vector resulting from the action of @xmath93 .",
    "each entry of @xmath94 now has a new coefficient that comes from the action of the lindblad operators .",
    "the matrix @xmath91 is symmetric , and so may be diagonalized .",
    "the eigenvectors of this matrix are useful because they can be interpreted as lists of coefficients for new @xmath95 `` eigen - operators . ''",
    "we find that @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the corresponding eigenvalue for the particular eigenvector , and thus for the operator @xmath95 , we can easily find the time evolution , @xmath98 we see now that if we can write the @xmath50 operator in terms of these conserved operators @xmath95 , we obtain an exact expression for the time evolution of the system .",
    "a special case is the uniform susceptibility , @xmath90 , which commutes with the lindblad insertions , and thus will always be a conserved operator . because of the commutation",
    ", its corresponding coefficient eigenvector will always have an eigenvalue of @xmath99 , resulting in no decay for the observable in time .",
    "because @xmath91 is symmetric , we will get a set of eigenvectors that fully span their space , and so we can always form @xmath50 out of some linear combination of the operators @xmath95 . if we represent the coefficients of this linear combination of operators as @xmath100 , we have @xmath101 the real - time evolution of the staggered susceptibility operator is then @xmath102 thus we have proven that the behavior of the staggered susceptibility in time will always be described exactly as a sum of exponentially decaying functions .",
    "figure [ imag ] shows the real - time evolution of the quantity @xmath103 in time , for a linear system whose initial state was prepared using the @xmath0-@xmath1 model . for high values of @xmath104",
    ", we see high initial values of the staggered susceptibility , showing that the initial state is highly ordered .     for a one - dimensional eight site system .",
    "the initial state is prepared using the @xmath0-@xmath1 model with parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath104 values are @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the temperature of the system .",
    "we set @xmath109 and use @xmath9 to represent the real time .",
    "the line for @xmath110 is almost directly on top of the line for @xmath111 .",
    "this is why only two curves are visible . ]",
    "while the evolution for this system is more complicated than for previous systems , we do find for each lattice size there is one particular operator component ( which we will set as @xmath112 ) which obeys a staggered ordering and makes a larger contribution to @xmath50 than any of the other components .",
    "the dominant operator s contribution is made more dominant the more highly ordered the system is , and we find that as the lattice size increases , the eigenvalue @xmath113 for this dominant operator approaches @xmath114 , resulting in a decay rate for the dominant observable approaching @xmath115 .",
    "this is consistent with what we would expect because the susceptibility is the square of the magnetization , which had a decay rate of @xmath116 .",
    "the plot to the left in figure [ compare ] shows this approach as the lattice size increases .",
    "as we see from equations ( [ linchis1 ] ) and ( [ linchis2 ] ) , for both sets of linear lindblad operators the staggered susceptibility decays to the constant @xmath117 .",
    "however , for the quadratic lindblad operators the constant term reaches n/4 only in the large n limit . in the right plot of figure",
    "[ compare ] , we show the @xmath37-dependence of this constant term for quadratic lindblad operators .",
    "interestingly , these finite - volume effects occur in the quadratic case but not in the linear cases",

    "the left figure shows how the dominant operator approaches a real - time decay rate of @xmath118 as lattice size increases .",

    "figure [ structure ] shows the real - time evolution of these structure factors .",
    "we now clearly see a difference in time - dependence for different values of @xmath75 .",
    "low - momentum fourier modes are slowed down , due to the fact that the zero - mode , i.e. the total particle number , is conserved .",

    "square lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   square lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    finally , we compare the decay rates of the susceptibilities for all three types of lindblad operators in figure [ approach ] .",
    "we use two different lattice geometries : a @xmath125 site linear lattice and a @xmath126 square lattice , to capture the full comparison of their time evolution . in the linear case ,",
    "the @xmath127 for the first two linear lindblad operator sets exhibit the same decay behavior , with the quadratic operators causing a faster decay and a different limiting value @xmath128 . in the @xmath126 square lattice",
    ", we then see the difference between the first two lindblad operators manifest itself , since the second lindblad set has a decay rate that grows with the number of nearest neighbors , while the first lindblad set has a constant decay rate . as for the third set",
    ", it again has the fastest decaying @xmath103 and interestingly has the same limiting @xmath128 value whether the sixteen lattice sites are arranged in a line or a square .",
    "in this work we have shown that it is possible to find the real - time evolution of the staggered order parameter analytically for several fermionic systems , both for linear and quadratic jump operators .",
    "we note that there are other processes higher than quadratic for which this method will also work .",
    "for example , @xmath129 which has a magnetization which remains constant in time , but a susceptibility that will contain some decaying modes .",
    "another process that can be studied is @xmath130 which will have a decaying magnetization with decay rate @xmath131 , and also has a simple susceptibility decay rate of @xmath132 .",
    "all the processes involving nearest neighbor pairs caused dynamics that were dependent on the lattice geometry ( specifically number of nearest neighbors ) , while the process involving individual sites was independent of lattice geometry .",
    "additionally , the considered lindblad processes all involved the same number of creation and annihilation operators acting with the same strength , though this is not necessarily a requirement . finally , the key characteristic of our order parameter @xmath133 was that @xmath134 for any other operator which satisfies ( [ cond ] ) , the results of this paper also hold .",
    "we stress that these results are applicable to describe the time evolution of the order parameter regardless of the initial state of the density matrix .",
