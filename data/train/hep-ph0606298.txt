    "lately , electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg )  @xcite has again attracted more attention , not least because new collider data will hopefully provide information about the relevant ( supersymmetric ? ) physical parameters in the next years .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis relies on a strong first - order electroweak phase transition as the source of out - of - equilibrium effects . during a first - order phase transition",
    ", bubbles of the low - temperature ( broken ) phase nucleate and expand to fill all space .",
    "an important aspect in the determination of the baryon asymmetry is the impact of transport phenomena  @xcite . without transport ,",
    "cp - violating currents would only be generated near the bubble wall profile of the higgs vevs .",
    "close to the wall , sphaleron transitions are already strongly suppressed by the mass of the w - bosons , so that b - violating processes are inefficient in producing the observed baryon asymmetry ( bau ) .",
    "early works that incorporated transport effects into the ewbg calculus were based on the wkb approach  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "a cp - violating shift in the dispersion relation induces a force of second order in the gradient expansion in the boltzmann equation and leads to cp - violating fermion densities in the symmetric phase .",
    "later on , this formalism was applied to the mssm , where cp violation results from mixing effects in the chargino sector @xcite . in this context , the formalism had to be extended to the case of mixing fermions . in the mssm ,",
    "the second - order source is too weak to yield a successful baryogenesis  @xcite",
    ".    one disadvantage of the wkb method is the neglect of dynamical flavor mixing effects .",
    "while the shift in the dispersion relation is due to mixing of left- and right - handed components of the fermions and already present in the one - flavor case , flavor mixing contributions have been completely neglected after a flavor basis transformation to the mass eigenbasis .",
    "a series of papers  @xcite aimed at improving on this point by including flavor mixing by using a perturbative expansion of the kadanoff  baym equations . here ,",
    "the deviations of the green function have been interpreted as sources in the diffusion equation .",
    "this approach  like the wkb - approach  has the weakness that the transport equations only describe the dynamics of two classical quasi - particles in the chargino sector .",
    "cp violation is communicated from the charginos to the sm particles by their interactions .",
    "therefore , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite used the winos and higgsinos as quasi - particles in the interaction basis , where the interactions take a particularly simple form . in the wkb - approach",
    "the natural choice is the mass eigenbasis .",
    "this dependence on a flavor basis is unsatisfactory , especially since the flavor mixing cp - violating source vanishes in the mass eigenbasis completely . a numerical analysis , making use of the first - order source in the interaction basis in refs .",
    "@xcite , leads to successful electroweak baryogenesis for a certain range in the parameter space , even though at least some fine - tuning is required to fulfill the electron electric dipole moment ( edm ) constraints .",
    "recently , some of the authors have derived semiclassical transport equations for the chargino sector from first principles  @xcite .",
    "the derivation is based on the kadanoff - baym equations and does not depend on classical reasoning to fill the gap between cp violation and transport effects .",
    "technically , the two main improvements on the resulting transport equations are independence of the flavor basis and the absence of the source strength ambiguities .",
    "first , since the semiclassical transport equations describe the dynamics of a @xmath0 matrix in flavor space , the transformation properties of the transport equations under flavor basis changes are explicit , and no restriction to quasi - particles has to be used . secondly , because the cp - violating sources appear naturally and uniquely as higher order terms in the gradient expansion of the mass background fields , there are no ambiguities in the source strength .",
    "the mixing effects lead to an additional force of first order of the gradient expansion in the transport equations .",
    "in contrast , in the work reported on in @xcite , for dimensional reasons , the sources had to be multiplied by a typical thermalization time @xmath1 , while in  @xcite the removal of the ambiguity in the source strength was based on the ( classical ) fick s law . in the case of second - order effects ,",
    "the first principle derivation confirms the wkb approach if the latter is handled carefully  @xcite .",
    "applying this advanced transport theory to the mssm  @xcite , the quantitative analysis shows two distinct features , which are less definitive in the results of the former approach @xcite : first , mixing effects are strongly suppressed away from mass degeneracy in the chargino sector , @xmath2 .",
    "so mixing in that sector is only effective if the _ a priori _ unrelated wino mass parameter @xmath3 and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath4 are tied together .",
    "secondly , the produced bau suffers from an exponential boltzmann suppression in the case of heavy charginos . in this formalism",
    ", successful electroweak baryogenesis requires rather large cp violation in the chargino sector , @xmath5 , even for the most favorable choice of the other model parameters . in comparison ,",
    "the approach followed in refs .",
    "@xcite leads to viable baryogenesis for less constrained chargino masses and cp violation of order @xmath6 . hence ,",
    "if the advanced transport theory is used , not only the parameter space of viable baryogenesis is much more restricted , but also the maximally achievable bau is smaller . because of the necessity of large cp - violating phases , additional arguments ( cancellations , or a large value of the cp - odd higgs mass parameter ) are required to suppress the electron edm by a _ factor 5 - 6_. on top of this , a light right - handed stop and a light higgs are needed to allow for a strong first - order phase transition  @xcite ( light stop scenario ) .",
    "thus , electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm is severely constrained .    in this paper",
    "we study electroweak baryogenesis in a singlet extension of the mssm , where the divergences of the singlet tadpole are tamed by a discrete r - symmetry @xcite .",
    "the r - symmetry is violated by the supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "a singlet tadpole is then induced at some high loop order , which is too small to destabilize the weak scale , but large enough to evade the cosmological domain wall problem @xcite .",
    "our analysis supports the result of ref .",
    "@xcite that a strong first - order phase transition is quite generic , once experimental constraints on the higgs and sparticle spectrum are taken into account .",
    "the phase transition is induced by tree - level terms in the higgs potential without the need of a light stop .",
    "going beyond ref .",
    "@xcite , we actually compute the baryon asymmetry and the bubble wall properties .",
    "we find that the observed baryon asymmetry can be produced with mild tuning of the model parameters .",
    "the first and second generation squarks and sleptons have to be heavy ( a few tev ) to suppress the one - loop contributions to the edms .",
    "in contrast to the mssm , there are no strong constraints from the two - loop edms , since @xmath7 is usually small  @xcite .",
    "several variants of mssm singlet extensions have been studied in the literature with respect to their impact on electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the most detailed of these studies is ref .",
    "@xcite , where a general singlet model without discrete symmetries was considered .",
    "this general model supports electroweak baryogenesis in a large part of its parameter space . in the current work ,",
    "the r - symmetry forbids a self coupling of the singlet , leading to a quite constrained higgs and neutralino phenomenology .",
    "still , it is encouraging to see that even this restricted framework allows for successful electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] we will present the model and clarify notation . in sections  [ ewbg ] and [ ewpt ] , we will discuss the mechanism that drives baryogenesis in the nmssm and the dynamics of the phase transition . in section  [ numana ] ,",
    "numerical results will be presented before we conclude in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the notation in this section follows refs .",
    "@xcite , including , however , a generalization to an additional cp - violating phase in the singlet sector .",
    "the superpotential , including the multi - loop generated tadpole term is w_nmssm = s h_1 h_2 - s + y_t q h_2 u^c + , [ w_nmssm ] where the dots denote the remaining terms in the mssm superpotential , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the singlet superfield and , @xmath11 .",
