    ", the distribution @xmath12 is not assumed to be integrable .",
    "we recall that @xmath12 is integrable in the sense of frobenius ( i.e.  stable under the lie bracket operation ) if and only if the fibers @xmath15 are the tangent spaces to leaves of a holomorphic foliation .",
    "more precisely , @xmath12 is integrable if and only if the torsion operator @xmath19 of  @xmath12 , defined  by @xmath20~\\mod~\\mathcal{d}\\ ] ] vanishes identically .",
    "as is well known , @xmath19 is skew symmetric in @xmath21 and can be viewed as a holomorphic section of the bundle @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 be a real submanifold of @xmath9 of class @xmath24 and of real dimension @xmath4 with @xmath25 .",
    "we say that @xmath23 is _ transverse to @xmath12 _ if for every @xmath26 we have @xmath27 we could in fact assume more generally that the distribution @xmath12 is singular , i.e.  given by a certain saturated subsheaf @xmath28 of @xmath29 ( `` saturated '' means that the quotient sheaf @xmath30 has no torsion ) .",
    "then @xmath28 is actually a subbundle of @xmath13 outside an analytic subset @xmath31 of codimension@xmath32 , and we further assume in this case that @xmath33 .",

    "indeed , such a foliation is realized near any regular point @xmath40 as the set of fibers of a certain submersion : there exists an open neighborhood @xmath41 of @xmath40 in @xmath9 and a holomorphic submersion @xmath42 to an open subset @xmath43 such that the fibers of @xmath44 are the leaves of @xmath12 in  @xmath41",

    "the restriction @xmath49 provides @xmath23 with holomorphic coordinates on  @xmath50 , and it is clear that any other local trivialization of the foliation on a different chart @xmath51 would give coordinates that are changed by local biholomorphisms @xmath52 in the intersection @xmath53 , thanks to the holomorphic character of  @xmath12 .",
