    "the electron tunneling in metal  insulator",
    " semiconductor ( mis ) structures is a useful tool for studying the energy spectrum of two- and three - dimensional states , the interaction of carriers with the semiconductor - insulator boundary , the interaction with elementary excitations such as optical phonons , magnons , etc.@xcite the tunneling in mis structures based on wide - gap semiconductors , for example gaas has been studied in detail.@xcite in these semiconductors the electron effective @xmath2-factor is small and spin - dependent effects in tunneling do not manifest themselves .",
    "the opposite situation is observed in hgte - type semiconductors with an inverted energy spectrum , where the electrons are the carriers of the fourfold degenerate ( at @xmath3 ) band .",
    "the difference of contributions by different electron spin states to various phenomena for such materials was discussed by a number of authors.@xcite it has been found experimentally that with the magnetic field parallel to the current , the amplitudes of shubnikov - de - haas oscillations connected with the different spin states differ largely.@xcite an analogous difference in tunneling conductivity in structures based on inverted - spectrum semiconductors has been observed with magnetic field perpendicular to the normal to the plane of a tunneling structure ( @xmath4).@xcite with this magnetic field orientation , the energy of the states depends not only on the quantum number , @xmath5 , and the quasimomentum in the direction of the magnetic field , @xmath6 , but also oscillation center ",
    "bounadry distance , @xmath7 , and this @xmath7 dependence of the energy is essential for oscillation amplitudes of the tunneling conductivity in the magnetic field .",
    "it is well known that for a twofold degenerate parabolic band the energy of an electron increases monotonically with decreasing @xmath7 .",
    "this @xmath8-@xmath7 relation is the same for both spin states .",
    "consequently , the contributions to the tunneling conductivity , that come from tunneling into different spin states , should be close in magnitude in mis structures based on such materials . in terms of the one - band energy spectrum model ,",
    "magnetotunneling under an in - plane magnetic field was considered in refs . .",
    "in semiconductors with a complex spectrum , the behavior of the different spin states near the boundary may differ significantly and it should lead to a distinction in tunneling into different spin states .",
    "thus the behavior of the landau levels in the vicinity of the boundary in the semiconductors with the energy spectrum described by the dirac hamiltonian was calculated in ref . .",
    "it was shown that in a symmetric band - inverted junction the landau eigenenergies vary nonmonotonically with the orbit center  structure interface distance and this behavior various for different spin states .",
    "the same problem was considered also for semiconductors with the inverted spectrum , described by the luttinger hamiltonian.@xcite the behavior of the landau levels near the boundary is different for different spin states in this case , too , and this fact was drawn on to explain the significant difference of the tunneling conductivity oscillation amplitudes associated with tunneling into different spin states in inverted semiconductor @xmath9-insulator - metal tunneling structures at @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that the electrons in inverted semiconductors were the carriers of the fourfold degenerate @xmath11 band was essential to the explanation of the observed peculiarities .",
    "surprisingly , the similar peculiarities of the tunneling conductivity into different spin states at @xmath4 are observed for some tunneling structures based on narrow - gap semiconductors , where the electrons are the carriers of the twofold degenerate @xmath12 band .",
    "however , the ratio of the tunneling conductivity oscillation amplitudes associated with tunneling into different spin states varies widely for various tunnel structures .",
    "one possibility is that the surface potential at the semiconductor - insulator boundary is different in these tunneling structures .",
    "such peculiarities of the tunneling into different spin states are the subject of the present paper .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ two ] presents and analyzes an experimental data for tunneling conductivity oscillations with various magnetic field orientations .",
    "section [ three ] is devoted to the calculation of the behavior of the landau levels near the surface of a kane spectrum semiconductor .",
    "the basic equations and formalism are spelled out .",
    "results of the calculation of tunneling conductivity oscillations and a comparison with experimental data are presented in section [ four ] .",
    "we have investigated the tunneling conductivity @xmath13 and its derivative @xmath14 as functions of bias @xmath15 and magnetic field in p-@xmath16-oxide - al ( @xmath17 ) structures with @xmath18 mev in magnetic fields up to 6 t at a temperature of 4.2 k. tunnel structures were fabricated on single - crystal p-@xmath19 with uncompensated acceptor concentration @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "the doping level was determined from an analysis of galvanomagnetic phenomena in the temperature range 4.2 - 80 k. the procedure for the fabrication of tunneling structures was described in our previous papers.@xcite the resistance of our structures was @xmath22 kohm .",
    "several tunnel structures prepared on each sample were investigated .",
    "the energy diagram of the tunneling contact is shown in fig .",
    "the bias shifts the fermi level of the metal relative to that of the semiconductor ( @xmath23 ) and the tunneling conductivity is proportional to the density of states in the semiconductor at energy @xmath24 .",
    "the magnetic field quantizes the energy spectrum of the semiconductor and the tunneling conductivity becomes an oscillatory function of magnetic field and bias .",
    "typical oscillation pictures of the tunneling conductivity in a magnetic field at a fixed bias for two different structures are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "it is seen that ( i ) for both structures the oscillation maxima are split , and at @xmath25 the amplitudes of the components are comparable in magnitude ; ( ii ) the amplitudes of the maxima and magnetic field positions exhibit a rather complicated behavior in tilted magnetic field ; ( iii ) at @xmath4 the ratio of the amplitudes of the components are close in magnitude for structure i and they differ significantly for structure ii , so that high - field components are hard to resolve at this magnetic field orientation .",
    "similar peculiarities of oscillation maxima amplitudes are observed in the bias dependences of @xmath26 at a fixed magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a fourier analysis of the oscillations shows that the @xmath27 vs @xmath28 curves have two fundamental fields , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the values of fundamental fields do not vary with angle between @xmath31 and @xmath5 , only the amplitude of fourier component @xmath32 decreases when @xmath33 so that it practically disappears for structure ii .",
    "thus , this behavior of the oscillation provides evidence that the tunneling conductivity oscillations for both structures are due to tunneling into bulk landau levels , splitting of the oscillation maxima corresponds to the spin splitting of the landau levels , and the probability of tunneling into spin - up and spin - down states for structure ii is remarkably different at @xmath34 .    the fundamental field @xmath29 at bias @xmath15 is determined by the value of quasimomentum at the energy @xmath24 , @xmath35 , so that measurements at various biases make it possible to obtain the dispersion law @xmath36 for a wide energy range .",
    "@xcite for the structures investigated , the experimental data are in good agreement with the @xmath36 curve calculated in terms of the kane model with parameters @xmath37 ev cm , @xmath38 mev , @xmath39 .",
    "it is well known that the phenomena occurring in a tilted magnetic field are a very complicated problem .",
    "we will therefore restrict our attention to the results at @xmath25 and @xmath34 , namely , the ratio between the oscillation amplitudes for tunneling into different spin states and the relationship of this ratio to the structure parameters .",
    "let us consider the tunneling current and tunneling conductivity at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "for a metal - insulator - semiconductor structure , the fermi energy of the metal is much greater than that of the semiconductor ; therefore , upon summation over all metal states , the tunneling current for a structure with low barrier transparency can be written in the form @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the barrier transparency , @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the electron velocity operator and the wave function in the semiconductor , and @xmath46 is the coordinate of the boundary .",
    "the summation runs over all states in the semiconductor , from energy @xmath23 to @xmath47 .    in a magnetic field ,",
    "the semiconductor s states are defined by three quantum numbers : landau level number @xmath5 , oscillator center position , and the quasimomentum component in the direction of the magnetic field . at @xmath40 @xmath48",
    "the quantity @xmath49 depends on @xmath50 only , and going to integration over energy we obtain @xmath51 @xmath52    in the magnetic field @xmath53 .",
    "the landau eigenenergies are a function of the orbit center - barrier distance @xmath7 and @xmath6 , so the square of the velocity at the boundary is also a function of @xmath7 and @xmath6 , @xmath54 @xmath55    thus , to calculate the tunneling conductivity at @xmath4 , one needs to calculate the distance dependencies of the velocity and energy near the boundary .",
    "this problem for a semiconductor with a kane spectrum is considered in the next section .",
    "to calculate the behavior of the landau levels near the boundary at @xmath34 and the tunneling current for this magnetic field orientation , let us consider an insulator - semiconductor structure with an abrupt interface ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the insulator has the same energy structure as the semiconductor with the same momentum matrix element @xmath57 but with an energy gap value much greater than that for a semiconductor .",
    "@xcite the parameters @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the conduction and valence band offsets , respectively .",
    "for such a structure we can solve the schrdinger equation for @xmath60 ( i.e. , for an insulator ) and @xmath61 ( i.e. , for a semiconductor ) independently . matching these solutions at @xmath46 in the required way",
    ", we find the solution for entire structure .",
    "we use the kane energy spectrum model for a semiconductor and an insulator .",
    "the interaction with remote and spin - orbit split @xmath62 bands is neglected .",
    "we choose the direction @xmath63 to be to normal to the interface and @xmath64 to be aligned with the magnetic field(@xmath65 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath66 is chosen as @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the components of the momentum operator are @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 is the magnetic length . to start with",
    "we wish to consider this problem for @xmath72 . in this case",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath73 splits up into two independent equations corresponding to the landau spin sublevels , designated as _ a_- and _ b_-sets . for the _ a_-set these equations",
    "read as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and for the _ b_-set , @xmath76 where    @xmath77    here @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are dimensionless coordinates , energies @xmath8 and @xmath80 are measured from the top of the semiconductor valence band .",
    "we seek solutions of ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) in the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is a confluent hypergeometric function.@xcite using the properties of the confluent hypergeometric function , one can write the particular solutions for the _ a_-set @xmath84 where @xmath85 and for the _ b_-set , @xmath86 where @xmath87 the solutions for the insulator that correspond to the same energy as the solution for semiconductor are given by ( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq10 ] ) , where @xmath8 and @xmath80 are changed to @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .    the general solution for @xmath61 @xmath90 and @xmath60 @xmath91 for the _ a_-set is @xmath92_{r , l}&=&a^{r , l}\\left[\\psi_{a}^{+}\\right]_{r , l}\\nonumber \\\\ & & + b^{r , l}\\left[\\psi_{a}^{-}\\right]_{r , l } \\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the general solution for the _ b_-set is similar in form .",
    "the quantity @xmath93 has to converge at @xmath94 and @xmath95 has to converge at @xmath96 , so we must set @xmath97 .",
    "matching conditions are obtained by integrating the schrdinger equation across the boundary .",
    "for the _ a_-set these conditions are :    [ eq12 ] @xmath98_{l}=\\left[\\psi^{1}_{a}(0)\\right]_{r}\\ ] ] @xmath99_{l}= \\left[\\psi^{2}_{a}(0)+\\sqrt{3}\\psi^{3}_{a}(0)\\right]_{r}\\ ] ]    and for the _ b_-set ,    [ eq13 ] @xmath100_{l}=\\left[\\psi^{1}_{b}(0)\\right]_{r}\\ ] ] @xmath101_{l}= \\left[\\sqrt{3}\\psi^{2}_{b}(0)+\\psi^{3}_{b}(0)\\right]_{r}\\ ] ]    these matching conditions give the secular equation for calculating the @xmath7 dependence of energy .",
    "this problem was solved numerically with parameters corresponding to the samples investigated ( @xmath38 mev , @xmath37 ev cm ) and @xmath102 ev , @xmath103 ev.@xcite such curves for the _ a_- and _ b_-sets are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] in dimensionless coordinates ( @xmath104,@xmath105 ) , where @xmath106 , and @xmath107 is the electron effective mass at the conduction band bottom .",
    "a pronounced difference between the spin sublevels is seen .",
    "this is the result of the spin - orbit interaction with the boundary .",
    "it is evident from eq.([eq5 ] ) that to calculate the tunneling conductivity , we need the @xmath7 dependence of the velocity squared at the boundary . with the definition of the velocity operator",
    "@xmath108 $ ] we have calculated @xmath109 for the levels presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , and as an illustration these results for sublevels @xmath110 , and @xmath111 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in calculating the tunneling conductivity ,",
    "we have assumed that the @xmath7 dependencies of energy and @xmath109 have the same form at any @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the contributions that the tunneling into different landau sublevels makes to the tunneling conductivity as calculated from eq.([eq5 ] ) .",
    "note that tunneling into _ b_-levels is more effective in consequence of differences in the @xmath8 vs @xmath7 and @xmath109 vs @xmath7 curves for _ a _ and _ b _ sublevels .",
    "the model discussed here has only two parameters , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , and the results have only a weak dependence on these parameters . finally ,",
    "summing the contributions to the tunneling conductivity by the different landau sublevels and subtracting the monotone component , we obtain the oscillatory part of the tunneling conductivity presented in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . for comparison ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] also the oscillations of the tunneling conductivity of the same structure at @xmath112 , which are calculated in the same way as in ref . .",
    "it is seen that at @xmath112 the amplitudes of the tunneling maxima connected with tunneling into _ a _ and _ b _ sublevels are close in magnitude .",
    "inspection of the experimental and calculated results ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig8 ] ) shows that the relationship among the oscillation amplitudes at @xmath112 agree well with experimental data for both structures . whereas at @xmath4 the ratio of the _ a_-maximum amplitude to the _ b_-maximum amplitude is appreciably greater than the calculated value for structure i , but much less for structure ii .",
    "one conceivable reason for this discrepancy is the presence of an attractive or a repulsive potential in the semiconductor near the semiconductor - insulator interface . in order to verify this assumption",
    "the above calculation was carried out for structures with a model potential which we suppose as a rectangular well ( or a barrier ) of width @xmath113 and value @xmath114 . in this case",
    "the wave functions in three regions , @xmath60 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , have the same form ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "it is essential that for @xmath115 both terms in eq.([eq11 ] ) should be taken into account .",
    "the requirement that the boundary conditions ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) be fulfilled at @xmath46 and at @xmath117 gives a secular equation for calculating the @xmath7 dependence of energy .",
    "the results of calculations for the surface well ( @xmath118 mev , @xmath119  ) and the barrier ( @xmath120 mev , @xmath119  ) are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] , and [ fig10 ] .",
    "the parameters of the potential are so adjusted that the well can not hold the 2d states .",
    "it is seen that the effect of the surface potential is different for the _ a_- and _ b_-sublevels . as a result ,",
    "the ratio between amplitudes of tunneling conductivity maxima associated with tunneling into _ a_- and _ b_-sublevels is strongly dependent on the surface potential . for the repulsive potential the amplitudes of _ a_- and _ b_-maxima can be close in magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig10]c ) , as is experimentally observed for structure i ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) , while for a sufficiently large attractive potential only _",
    "b_-maxima are visible ( fig .",
    "[ fig10]a ) , as is experimentally observed for structure ii ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "note that for @xmath112 , the calculated and experimentally observed amplitudes of the tunneling conductivity maxima associated with tunneling into _ a_- and _ b_-sublevels are close in magnitude , for both the attractive and the repulsive potential .",
    "thus , the ratio of amplitudes of maxima due to tunneling into _ a _ and _ b _ sublevels at @xmath34 depends on the surface potential and provides a way for estimating the value of the surface potential under conditions where the surface potential is small and can not localize the 2d states .    as mentioned above ( ii ) , the amplitudes of the maxima and the magnetic field positions in a tilted magnetic field exhibit a rather complicated behavior ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is clearly seen for maxima observed in a high magnetic field .",
    "the positions of the maxima vary nonmonotonically with angle and with @xmath121 their amplitudes decrease drastically .",
    "basically , the same behavior has been observed for all the structures investigated .",
    "in addition , we would like to point out one further peculiarity of tunneling conductivity in a tilted magnetic field .",
    "it is most pronounced in bias dependencies of @xmath14 in the structures based on narrower - gap @xmath122 ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) . a fine structure of maxima associated with tunneling into _",
    "b_-sublevels arises with magnetic field orientations close to @xmath4 ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "b_-maxima have a similar fine structure .",
    "the calculations of the energy spectrum and tunneling in a tilted magnetic field are essential to understanding of peculiarities observed . to the authors knowledge ,",
    "such calculations for structures based on kane semiconductors are not available .",
    "tunneling conductivity oscillations in a magnetic field have been investigated for structures based on narrow - gap @xmath124 .",
    "these oscillations in the structure investigated are shown to arise from tunneling into bulk landau levels . rather remarkably , at @xmath4 the relationship of the amplitudes of the maxima associated with tunneling into different spin states varies significantly for the structures investigated , so that only tunneling into one - spin sublevels is observed in some structures .    to understand the causer of this distinction",
    ", we have calculated the behavior of the landau levels near the surface and the tunneling conductivity oscillation at @xmath4 .",
    "the relationship of the amplitudes of the maxima associated with tunneling into different spin states is shown to depend dramatically on the surface potential .",
    "thus the investigations of the tunneling conductivity at @xmath4 provide a way to estimate the value of the surface potential when this is small and can not localize the 2d states .",
