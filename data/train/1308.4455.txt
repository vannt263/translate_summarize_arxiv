    "meson decay constants provide essential information on the qcd interaction between a quark and an antiquark .",
    "they are the lowest moments of the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( das ) for a quark and an antiquark inside a meson .",
    "they are also important ingredients in studying the cp violation in leptonic or nonleptonic weak decays of mesons .",
    "many theoretical works have been devoted to predict these fundamental constants of mesons , e.g. the lattice qcd  @xcite , the qcd sum rules  @xcite and the light - front quark model  ( lfqm )  @xcite based on the lf quantization  @xcite of qcd . among various theoretical approaches ,",
    "the lfqm has been successful in computing not only the meson mass spectra  @xcite but also the decay constants and weak transition form factors of mesons  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the light - front dynamics ( lfd ) carries the maximum number   ( seven ) of the kinetic ( or interaction independent ) generators and thus the less effort in dynamics is necessary in order to get the qcd solutions that reflect the full poincar@xmath1 symmetries .",
    "also , the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation of lfd yields the sign correlation between the lf energy @xmath2 and the lf longitudinal momentum @xmath3 and leads to the suppression of vacuum fluctuations .    despite these advantages in lfd ,",
    "the zero - mode  ( @xmath4 )  @xcite complication in the matrix element has been noticed for the vector meson decay constant @xmath0  @xcite as well as some electroweak form factors involving a spin-1 particle  @xcite .",
    "for the case of @xmath0 , there has been a debate about the zero - mode contribution to the matrix element of the plus component of the weak current @xmath5 . unlike the electroweak form factor described by a three - point function involving an external probe ,",
    "the meson decay amplitude is described by a two - point function and may be regarded as one of the simplest possible physical observables .",
    "it is interesting that this apparently simple amplitude bears abundant fundamental information on qcd vacuum dynamics and chiral symmetry . in this respect ,",
    "the zero - mode issue of @xmath0 in lfd is highly non - trivial and deserves careful analyses .",
    "indeed , we found  @xcite that the existence or absence of the zero mode may depend on the model , especially on the form of vector meson vertex operator @xmath6 , while jaus  @xcite claimed that there exists zero - mode contribution to @xmath0 even for the case of the good current @xmath7 .",
    "the purpose of this work is not just to clarify this zero - mode issue in the @xmath0 prediction from lfqm but to discuss this topic in relation to the vacuum fluctuation consistent with the chiral symmetry of qcd . with this aim ,",
    "we attempt to extend our previous analysis  @xcite from the exactly solvable manifestly covariant bethe - salpeter ( bs ) model to the more phenomenologically accessible realistic lfqm  @xcite and discuss a self - consistent covariant description of the vector meson decay constant in view of the link between qcd and lfqm .",
    "a systematic study of twist-3 light - cone das of vector mesons in qcd was presented in refs .",
    "it was based on the conformal expansion taking into account meson and quark mass corrections .",
    "two - particle das of vector mesons were classified in the same way as the more familiar nucleon structure functions , i.e. parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which correspond to the independent tensor structures in nonlocal matrix elements .",
    "nowadays , we know that there are twelve independent generalized parton distributions in deeply virtual compton scattering  @xcite . for the forward case with zero skewness , however , nine independent pdfs are found and classified by twist , spin and chirality  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the analysis of vector meson das revealed an analogous pattern as the operator structures are the same with the case of pdfs and the @xmath8 meson polarization vector formally substitutes the nucleon spin vector in the lorentz structures  @xcite .",
    "eight independent two - particle das were found with the classification due to twist , spin and chirality  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we focus on the chirality even distributions up to twist 3 .",
    "the light - cone das of a vector meson are defined in terms of the following matrix elements of quark - antiquark non - local gauge invariant operators at light - like separation  @xcite : [ daap1 ] 0||q(0)[0,z]^q(z)|v(p , h)= f_v m ^1_0 dx e^-ixpz \\ { p^ ^||_2;v(x ) + ( ^_h - p^ ) ^_3;v(x ) + ( ) z^ } , where @xmath9 and the path - ordered gauge factor [ daap2 ] [ 0 , z ] = pensures the gauge invariance of the matrix elements and is equal to unity in the lf gauge @xmath10 . according to the classification of ball and braun  @xcite , @xmath11 and @xmath12",

    "it is a common practice to utilize an exactly solvable manifestly covariant model to check the existence ( or absence ) of the zero - mode and substitute the radial and spin - orbit wave functions of the exactly solvable model with the more phenomenologically accessible model wave functions that can be provided by lfqm . to discuss the nature of the lf zero - mode in meson decay amplitude",
    ", we may denote the total lf longitudinal momentum of the meson , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the individual quark and antiquark lf longitudinal momenta , respectively .",
    "similarly , the lf energy @xmath24 is shared by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "the lf energy integration is done typically by using the cauchy s theorem for a contour integration . for the lf energy integration of the two - point function to compute the meson decay amplitude",

    "however , it is crucial to note that the poles move to infinity ( or fly away in the complex plane ) as the lf longitudinal momentum , either @xmath22 or @xmath23 , goes to zero  @xcite .",
    "unless the contribution from the pole flown into infinity vanishes , it must be kept in computing the physical observable . since such contribution , if it exists , appears either from @xmath30 and @xmath31 or from @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we call it as the zero - mode contribution . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we discussed the power - counting method which can reveal the existence or absence of the zero - mode contribution by analyzing the power behavior of the integration variable such as @xmath22 or @xmath23 and presented an effective method of identifying the corresponding zero mode operators . if the zero - mode exists , it is critical to take into account its contribution in order to get the identical result to the one obtained by manifestly covariant calculation .    as discussed above , in the case of two - point function for the computation of the meson decay constant ,",
    "the zero - mode contribution is locked into a single point of the lf longitudinal momentum , i.e. either @xmath30 where @xmath31 or @xmath32 where @xmath33 . since",
    "one of the constituents of the meson carries the entire momentum @xmath34 of the meson , the other constituent carries the zero lf longitudinal momentum and thus can be regarded as the zero - mode quantum fluctuation linked to the vacuum .",
    "this link is due to a pair creation of particles with zero lf longitudinal momenta from the vacuum .",
    "it is important to capture the vacuum effect for the consistency with the chiral symmetry properties of the strong interactions  @xcite . with this link ,",
    "the zero - mode contribution in the meson decay process can be considered effectively as the effect of vacuum fluctuation consistent with the chiral symmetry of the strong interactions . in this respect ,",
    "the lfqm with effective degrees of freedom represented by the constituent quark and antiquark may be linked to the qcd .",
    "the zero - mode link to the qcd vacuum may provide the view of effective zero - mode cloud around the quark and antiquark inside the meson and the constituents dressed by the zero - mode cloud may satisfy the chiral symmetry consistent with the qcd .",
    "since the constituent quark and antiquark used in the lfqm have already absorbed the zero - mode cloud , the zero - mode contribution in the lfqm may not be as explicit as in the manifestly covariant model calculation but provide effectively the consistency with the chiral symmetry .    in the lfqm presented in  @xcite , the constituent quark and antiquark in a bound state",
    "are required to be on - mass - shell , which is different from the covariant formalism in which the constituents are off - mass - shell .",
    "the spin - orbit wave function in the lfqm is obtained by the interaction - independent melosh transformation  @xcite from the ordinary equal - time static spin - orbit wave function assigned by the quantum number @xmath35 .",
    "the common feature of the lfqm presented in  @xcite is to use the sum of the light - front energy of the constituent quark and antiquark for the meson mass in the spin - orbit wave function . in the standard light - front ( slf )",
    "approach used in the lfqm  @xcite , the vector meson decay constant @xmath36 is obtained by the matrix element of the plus component of the currents in 3-dimensional lf momentum space .",
    "as the constituent quark and antiquark in lfqm are the dressed constituents including the zero - mode effect , the slf approach within the phenomenological lfqm  @xcite is not amenable to determine the zero - mode contribution by itself .",
    "we thus utilize a manifestly covariant model to check the existence ( or absence ) of the zero - mode and substitute the radial and spin - orbit wave functions with the phenomenologically accessible model wave functions provided by the lfqm analysis of meson mass spectra .",
    "if the on - mass - shell spin structure of the matrix element in slf approach is not exactly reproducible from the manifestly covariant model , the slf result is identified to be necessary to take into account the zero - mode .",
    "we discuss the zero - mode operator necessary for the slf analysis of the meson decay process .",
    "to further clarify the zero - mode issue regarding on @xmath0 , we analyze the twist-2 and twist-3 two - particle das and examine a fundamental constraint anticipated from the lfqm  @xcite : i.e. symmetric quark - antiquark das for the equal quark and antiquark bound state mesons such as @xmath8 .",
    "as we shall show in this work , the existence of zero - mode contribution to @xmath0 claimed by jaus  @xcite and subsequently advocated by other authors  @xcite contradicts with this anticipated constraint .",
    "we also note that the two equivalent decay constants obtained from @xmath37 and @xmath38 are related to the twist-2 and twist-3 two - particle das of a vector meson  @xcite , respectively .",
