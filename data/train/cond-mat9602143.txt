    "there has been a great deal of recent interest in ultranarrow confined semiconductor systems , called quantum wire structures , where the motion of the electrons is essentially restricted to be one dimensional ( 1d ) because of their potential , both , in basic physics and for applications to novel device concepts@xcite .",
    "thus , both from the fundamental and applied physics viewpoints , there is interest in understanding the electronic properties of quasi - one - dimensional quantum wires .",
    "the quantum wire structures are usually fabricated by lithographic techniques@xcite , epitaxial growth on tilted superlattices@xcite , overgrowth of preetched v - groove patterns@xcite , stress patterning@xcite , and cleaved edge overgrowth method@xcite which has been used to produce narrow quantum wires with atomic scale definition .    in a doped polar semiconductor ( in which most of the quantum wire structures are fabricated ) free carriers couple to the longitudinal optical ( lo)-phonons of the underlying lattice through the long - range polar frhlich coupling .",
    "the carrier - lo phonon interaction leads to polaronic many - body renormalization of the single particle free carrier properties , e.g. , polaronic effective mass renormalization , lowering of the effective band edge , inelastic scattering , broadening of the quasiparticle spectral function , etc .",
    "even though the weakly polar iii - v materials have rather small frhlich coupling constants , the electronic properties can still be substantially modified by the frhlich interaction , and , conversely , the phonon properties are affected by the coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "coulomb and frhlich interactions can not be disentangled in experimental situations , because many - body renormalization effects due to electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions in such a coupled system are fundamentally nonmultiplicative in nature ( as well as being nonadditive ) .",
    "our goal is to study a coupled 1d electron - phonon many - body system treating electrons and phonons on an equal footing .",
    "direct interaction between electrons via the coulomb interaction and polar electron lo - phonon interaction ( which is fundamentally coulombic in origin , arising from the dynamical interaction between charge carriers and lattice ions ) via the frhlich coupling are among the most extensively studied many - body interactions in solid - state physics . in a two - dimensional electron gas , quasiparticle properties of a polar electron gas have been extensively studied by treating the electron  electron and electron  phonon interactions on an equal footing@xcite . in ref .",
    ", jalabert and das sarma find that the coulomb and frhlich interaction effects are nonmultiplicative , and the actual many - body correction for a 2d electron gas is substantially different from the one - polaron result ( i.e. a single electron coupled to an lo - phonon system ) .",
    "in spite of substantial current interest in the properties of a polar quasi - one dimensional electron gas ( 1d eg ) existing in gaas quantum wires , there has been no detailed quantitative study of 1d quasiparticle properties including both the electron  electron and electron  phonon interactions . in a gaas ( or , other iii - v materials ) quantum wire , the electronic energy scales ( fermi and plasmon energies ) can be comparable to the lo - phonon energy , which produces strong mode coupling between plasmons and lo - phonon modes@xcite .",
    "thus , a complete many - body analysis based on treating electrons , phonons , and plasmons equivalently within the same approximation scheme is needed .",
    "we provide such an analysis in this article based on the leading - order many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the frhlich electron - lo phonon coupling constant in gaas is small , making a weak coupling diagrammatic expansion for calculating quasiparticle properties a meaningful approximation .",
    "well - established theoretical results@xcite ( tomonaga - luttinger model ) predict unusual non - fermi liquid - like properties for an interacting 1d system .",
    "no matter how weak the electron - electron interaction the non - interacting fermi surface is nonperturbatively unstable in the presence of interaction . while the instability of a noninteracting 1d fermi gas to an interacting 1d tomonaga - luttinger liquid is a well - established theoretical concept , the actual quantitative effect associated with the nonperturbative disappearance of the fermi surface is , in fact , rather small at finite temperatures in a weakly interacting 1d system such as a gaas quantum wire 1d eg .",
    "most of the experimentally observed electronic properties of semiconductor quantum wires have so far been interpreted in the literature as effective 1d fermi liquids , albeit at finite temperature and in the presence of impurity scattering induced collision broadening .",
    "indeed , based on a weak - coupling diagrammatic expansion in dynamically screened coulomb interaction , it has recently been argued@xcite that 1d electrons in gaas quantum wires behaves for most practical purposes as a thermally broadened fermi liquid at finite temperatures and , most importantly , in the presence of impurity scattering effects which are invariably present in real semiconductor quantum wires .",
    "the physical reason behind this result is that impurity scattering cuts off the emission of arbitrarily low energy plasmons by overdamping them , and the instability of the fermi surface , arising from the decay of quasiparticles into low energy plasmons , is prevented .",
    "our approach in this paper is to include electron - lo phonon frhlich interaction in this theory by doing an expansion in leading order dynamically screened coulomb plus frhlich interactions , both in the presence and absence of impurity scattering effects for the purpose of comparison .",
    "we note in this context that ( 1 ) the leading order calculation@xcite , in the absence of impurity scattering , is consistent with the nonperturbative tomonaga - luttinger result in the sense that it indicates a non - fermi liquid type behavior ( with different analytic properties , however ) ; ( 2 ) the nonperturbative tomonaga - luttinger liquid type calculations have only been carried out for the point contact model electron - electron interaction whereas our work uses the true long range coulomb ( and frhlich ) interaction as the bare interaction .",
    "usually the quantum wire confinement in the @xmath0-direction ( taken to be the growth direction ) is much stronger than the confinement in the @xmath1 direction in real systems ( assuming the 2d eg to be confined in the @xmath2 plane ) . the electron is typically confined in the @xmath0-direction on the order of less than @xmath3 , whereas currently the best confinement in the @xmath1 direction is approximately @xmath4 , leading to at least an order of magnitude difference in the energy - level spacings of the @xmath1 ( a few mev ) and the @xmath0 ( the order of tens of mev ) direction . in this paper",
    "we therefore assume for the sake of simplicity that the electron gas has zero thickness in the @xmath0 direction , but has a finite width in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "this , in fact , is one of the common models used in studying 1d quantum wire structures .",
    "confinement of the electrons in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 directions leads to the quantization of energy levels into different subbands .",
    "we assume the 1d quantum limit where the energy separation between the lowest - energy ( ground ) and higher - energy ( excited ) subbands is so much larger than all other energy scales in the problem that the higher subbands can be ignored . in this paper",
    "we calculate in the 1d quantum limit the zero temperature electron self - energy from the effective total dynamical electron  electron interaction , which is calculated by taking into account both the coulomb electron ",
    "electron interaction and the lo phonon - mediated frhlich interaction , within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "we treat electron  electron and electron  phonon interactions equally , and our only approximations are the use of the rpa and the neglect of vertex corrections , i.e. we keep the lowest order diagram in the total effective dynamically screened interaction . this approximation has long been employed successfully to calculate properties of three- and two - dimensional electron systems@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the rpa gives the _ exact _ low - energy screening properties of one - dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the self - energy and the effective interaction in these approximations are shown in fig .",
    "we ignore diagrams which are higher order in the screened interaction , such as the diagram shown in fig .",

    "our many - body theory includes the important physical effects of dynamical screening , phonon self - energy correction , plasmon - phonon mode coupling , fermi statistics , and landau damping .",
    "even though the problem is treated within the @xmath34 framework of the leading order effective interaction approximation ( i.e. rpa screening and neglect of vertex corrections ) , our results should be quite valid in gaas - based 1d eg .",
    "this is because gaas has a very weak frhlich coupling , which justifies the neglect of the electron - phonon vertex corrections , and its low effective mass and the large dielectric constants gives a small effective @xmath185 parameter , ( and in this limit generally rpa is valid ) , which makes direct electron - electron interaction also weak in the perturbative sense .",
    "the quasiparticle properties at @xmath186 are affected only by low energy processes and hence are not changed much by the inclusion of the optic - phonon coupling because the optic - phonon modes have a gap to excitation .",
    "the optic - phonon coupling does , however , shift some of the spectral weight to an extra undamped excitation at @xmath187 , which is the phonon analogy ( `` phononron '' ) to the plasmaron excitation , and it shifts the plasmaron energy up slightly , due to level repulsion between the plasmaron and the phonon excitation . as in the uncoupled system , inclusion of impurity scattering tends to smear out the above features .",
    "the properties at the fermi surface , such as the impurity - driven restoration of the discontinuity in the distribution function , are virtually the same for the coupled and uncoupled systems , again because of the gap of the optic - phonon mode . at higher energies ,",
    "the coupled system has an additional phonon - like mode @xmath177 which can scatter electrons .",
    "this leads to another divergence in the scattering rate @xmath79 ( i.e. , in addition to the one from plasmon emission ) .",
    "note that this purely many - body divergence occurs only when one couples the electron  electron and electron  phonon interactions together ; no such divergence is obtained for calculations in doped systems using only the frhlich interaction .",
