    "electron charge orderings phenomena are currently under intense investigations , because they are relevant to a broad range of important materials such as manganites , cuprates and organic conductors @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will discuss an effective model of charge ordered insulators .",
    "the hamiltonian considered has the following form : @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the creation operator of an electron with spin @xmath4 at the site  @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath0  is the on - site density interaction , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the intersite density - density interactions between nearest neighbours and next - nearest neighbours , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is the chemical potential , depending on the concentration of electrons : @xmath11 with and @xmath12 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be treated as the effective ones and will be assumed to include all the possible contributions and renormalizations like those coming from the strong electron - phonon coupling or from the coupling between electrons and other electronic subsystems in solid or chemical complexes .",
    "in such a general case arbitrary values and signs of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are important to consider .",
    "we have performed extensive study of the phase diagrams of the model ( [ row:1 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath13  @xcite . in the analysis we have adopted a variational approach ( va ) which treats the on - site interaction @xmath0 exactly and the intersite interactions ( @xmath1 ) within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) . within such an approach",
    "the phase diagrams of ( [ row:1 ] ) have been investigated till now for the special case only  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of repulsive and attractive .",
    "we consider only two - sublattice orderings on the lattice consisting of two interpenetrating sublattices such as for example sc or bcc lattices .        within the va",
    "the intersite interactions are decoupled within the mfa , what let us find a free energy per site @xmath14 . the condition ( [ row:2 ] ) for the electron concentration and a  minimization of @xmath14 with respect to the charge - order parameter lead to a set of two self - consistent equations ( for homogeneous phases ) , which are solved numerically .",
    "the charge - order parameter is defined as , where @xmath15 is the average electron density in a sublattice .",
    "if @xmath16 is non - zero the charge - ordered phase ( co ) is a solution , otherwise the non - ordered phase ( no ) occurs .    phase separation ( ps ) is a state in which two domains with different electron concentrations exist in the system ( coexistence of two homogeneous phases ) .",
    "the free energies of the ps states are calculated from the expression : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are values of a free energy at @xmath19 corresponding to the lowest energy homogeneous solutions and is a fraction of the system with a charge density @xmath20 .",
    "we find numerically the minimum of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath22 .    in the model considered only the following ps states can occur",
    ": ps2 is a coexistence of co and no phases and ps3 is a coexistence of two co phases with different concentrations ( and charge - order parameters ) .    in the paper",
    "we have used the following convention .",
    "a  second order transition is a  transition between homogeneous phases with a  continuous change of the order parameter at the transition temperature .",
    "a  transition between homogeneous phase and ps state is symbolically named as a  `` third order '' transition . during this transition a  size of one domain in the ps state decreases continuously to zero at the transition temperature .",
    "we also distinguished second order transition between two ps states , at which a continuous change of the order parameter in both domains takes place .",
    "second order transitions are denoted by solid lines on phase diagrams and dashed lines correspond to the `` third order '' transitions .",
    "we introduce also the following denotation : , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are numbers of nearest and next - nearest neighbours , respectively .",
    "obtained phase diagrams are symmetric with respect to half - filling ( ) because of the particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ row:1 ] ) , so the diagrams will be presented only in the range .",
    "examples of the @xmath25  vs.  @xmath13 phase diagrams evaluated for , and various ratios of are shown in fig .",
    "[ rys : um10 ] . if the co and no ( homogeneous ) states are separated by the second order transition line .    when a `` third order '' transition takes place at low temperatures , leading first to ps into two coexisting co phases ( ps3 ) , while at still lower temperatures co and no phases coexist ( ps2 ) .",
    "the critical point ( denoted as @xmath26 ) for this phase separation is located inside the co phase .",
    "the solid line is associated with continuous transition between two different ps states ( , the second order transition occurs in the domain with lower concentration ) .    for the transition between ps states does not occur",
    ", the area of ps3 stability vanishes and the critical point for the phase separation ( denoted as @xmath27 ) lies on the second order line . as occurs at and the homogeneous co",
    "phase does not exist beyond half - filling .",
    "when the lower branch of the `` third order '' curve approaches the critical point ( @xmath28 ) parabolically . is a higher order critical point and at this point the lines consisting of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath27 points connect together .    for sequences of transitions",
    "are similar to the previous case ( for corresponding values of @xmath31 ) , but now the phase diagrams are ( almost ) symmetric with respect to quarter - filling ( ) .",

    "in this paper we studied atomic limit of the extended hubbard model with intersite repulsion and next - nearest neighbour attraction .",
    "we considered two qualitatively different regimes of the on - site interaction : strong attraction and ( relatively ) strong repulsion .",
    "our analyses show that for attractive @xmath42 and the states with phase separation have the lowest free energy at sufficiently low temperatures , whereas for only homogeneous phases exist on the phase diagrams which have the form presented in ref .",

    "one should notice that a change of the strength of the next - nearest attraction can modify a type of the critical point for separation ( which can be @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28-point ) .",
