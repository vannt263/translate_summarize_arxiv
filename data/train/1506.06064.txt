    "recently , the atlas collaboration @xcite reported an experimental anomaly in diboson production with apparent excesses in boosted jets of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath2 channels at around 2 tev invariant mass of the boson pair . , @xmath7 , and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "] it is intriguing because the excesses are all around 2 tev .",
    "the local excesses are at @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xmath11 levels for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 channels , respectively ( though the global significance of the discrepancy in the @xmath0 channel is only @xmath12 . )",
    "the experiment used the method of jet substructure to discriminate the hadronic decays of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bosons from the usual qcd dijets .",
    "the advantage is that the hadronic decays of @xmath13 and @xmath14 afford much larger branching ratios for more events .",
    "however , the jet masses of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bosons have large overlaps such that the @xmath14 boson may be misinterpreted as a @xmath13 boson , and vice versa . nevertheless , we attempt to provide a logical explanation for the anomaly .",
    "the anomaly leads to a logical explanation that there exist some exotic particles in some forms of multiplets or under some symmetries ( because they have similar masses ) with relatively narrow widths decaying into diboson channels . in this note",
    ", we propose a phenomenological left - right model that consists of an extra @xmath15 gauge group with @xmath16 bosons .",
    "initially , we first perform phenomenological studies of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 boson with respect to the data separately . at the end , we shall give a more unified picture of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons coming from a single @xmath15 group .",
    "the @xmath3 boson couples to the right - handed fermions with a strength @xmath17 , which need not be the same as the weak coupling @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath3 boson can then be produced via @xmath19 annihilation .",
    "since the @xmath3 boson is at 2 tev , the production is mainly via valence quarks and so we anticipate the production cross section of @xmath20 is roughly two times as large as the @xmath21 cross section at the lhc",
    ". the @xmath3 boson can mix with the sm @xmath13 boson via a mixing angle , say , @xmath22 so that the @xmath3 boson can decay into @xmath0 with a mixing - angle suppression and right - handed fermions .",
    "we shall show that the @xmath3 decay into @xmath0 dominates if the mixing angle is larger than @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , it can explain the excess in the @xmath0 channel without violating the leptonic cross sections @xcite and the dijet - mass search at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the @xmath4 boson follows closely that of the @xmath3 boson .",
    "it is produced via @xmath24 annihilation with a coupling strength @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath4 boson mixes with the sm @xmath14 boson via another mixing angle @xmath25 , and then decays into @xmath1 to explain the excess in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "we adopt a simplified form that the @xmath4 only couples to the right - handed fermions , though in general it couples to both left- and right - handed fermions .",
    "there are , in general , a few important constraints that restrict the form the @xmath3 and @xmath4 models : ( i ) electroweak ( ew ) precision measurements , ( ii ) leptonic decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and ( iii ) dijet production cross sections , plus @xmath26 and @xmath27 production that are specific to the current work .",
    "the ew precision constraints mainly come from the deviations in the properties of the observed @xmath13 and @xmath14 bosons through the mixings between @xmath13 and @xmath3 bosons , and between @xmath14 and @xmath4 bosons",
    ". the measured properties of the @xmath13 boson restrict the mixing angle between the @xmath13 and @xmath3 boson to be @xmath28 @xcite , which is the approximate size of the mixing that is required to explain the diboson anomaly . on the other hand , the constraint on the mixing angle between the @xmath14 and @xmath4 bosons is much stronger .",
    "the updated limits for various @xmath4 models , in which the @xmath4 boson has direct couplings to sm particles , are of order @xmath29 .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the values required to explain the diboson anomaly .",
    "one possibility to relax this constraint is to employ the leptophobic @xmath4 model , which is achievable in a number of gut models @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the constraint on the mixing angle can be relaxed to @xmath30 @xcite , which is close to the value required to explain the diboson anomaly .",
    "therefore , we shall employ the leptophobic @xmath4 model in this work .",
    "furthermore , in the leptonic decays of @xmath31 we assume the right - handed neutrinos are heavy enough that the leptonic decays of the @xmath3 boson are also closed .",
    "note that we take the excess in the @xmath2 channel as either a fluctuation or the mis - interpretation because of the overlap between the @xmath13 and @xmath14 dijets .",
    "on the theory side , it is very difficult to have a spin-1 particle to decay significantly into @xmath2 , e.g. , the @xmath4 boson @xcite or a techni - rho meson .",
    "it is possible to have a spin-0 higgs - like boson to decay into @xmath2 .",
    "however , we found that the production cross section for a 2 tev higgs - like boson via gluon fusion is too small to explain the excess in the @xmath2 channel . therefore , we take the liberty to ignore the excess in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "the organization of this note is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the interactions of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons , and mixing with the sm @xmath13 and @xmath14 bosons . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the dijet cross sections to compare with the most updated limits from atlas @xcite and cms @xcite . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the cross sections of @xmath32 and @xmath33 and compare to the atlas data . in sec .",

    "the extra @xmath35 boson arises from the right - hand @xmath15 .",
    "the right - handed fermions are arranged in isospin doublet , e.g , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the right - handed neutrino .",
    "the interactions of the @xmath35 with fermions are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath17 is the coupling strength , which need not be the same as the left - handed coupling @xmath18 but should be of a similar size .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath35 denote the interaction eigenstates , which rotate into the mass eigenstates @xmath13 and @xmath3 via a mixing angle @xmath41 ( @xmath13 then represents the observed @xmath13 boson at @xmath42 gev and the @xmath3 is the hypothetical 2 tev boson ) : @xmath43 current ew constraints on the @xmath13-@xmath3 mixing angle mainly come from modifying the properties of the observed @xmath13 boson .",
    "the measurements put a limit about @xmath44 @xcite on the mixing angle @xmath41 , which is more or less consistent with the values that we use in this study ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - para - w ] ) .",
    "we shall show that such a small mixing angle of order @xmath45 is enough to explain the narrow width of the @xmath3 bump and the excess in the @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "on the other hand , due to the mixing with the sm @xmath13 boson , the heavy @xmath3 couples to @xmath0 with a coupling strength @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the usual coupling constant in the @xmath48 vertex .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath3 couples to @xmath26 with a full tree - level strength @xmath49 . between the @xmath13 and @xmath3 originates from the off - diagonal mass matrix entry , which also gives the tree - level unsuppressed coupling for @xmath3-@xmath13-@xmath50 .",

    "the assignment of @xmath167 and @xmath168 for the right - handed fermions are @xmath169    the first step of symmetry breaking at tev scale can occur via a higgs doublet @xmath170 under @xmath157 : @xmath171 the gauge field @xmath172 of the @xmath173 and the @xmath174 of the @xmath165 are rotated by angle @xmath175 into the @xmath176 of the @xmath177 and the @xmath4 boson : @xmath178 while the second step is the usual breaking of the ew symmetry by another higgs doublet with a vev @xmath179 . in order to obtain the coupling of the @xmath176 the same as the sm hypercharge @xmath180 in the first step of symmetry breaking , we require @xmath181 the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons obtain masses as @xmath182 where @xmath183 is very large .",
    "therefore , in leading order @xmath184 if @xmath185 .",
    "this is exactly the limit that we want to pursue , and we shall show that the couplings of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 to fermions will approach the values that we used in the analysis .",
    "note that @xmath186 .",
    "the size of @xmath187 can not be much smaller than @xmath188 given @xmath189 . in the limit of @xmath190 being large , the left - handed and right - handed couplings of the @xmath3 boson to sm fermions become @xcite @xmath191 which is exactly the same as the @xmath3 interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath192 .",
    "similarly , in the limit of large @xmath190 and small @xmath187 , the left - handed and right - handed couplings of the @xmath4 boson to sm fermions become @xcite @xmath193 note that the leptonic couplings @xmath194 are suppressed by @xmath195 and also because its @xmath196 .",
    "the left - handed couplings @xmath197 of quarks are also suppressed by @xmath195 .",
    "therefore , only the right - handed couplings of quarks are left unsuppressed , which is close to what we used in the analysis of @xmath4 with @xmath192 in previous sections . therefore , in the limit of large @xmath190 we have more or less achieved the leptophobic scenario with @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons having a similar mass at 2 tev and couplings to right - handed quarks only .",
    "we have considered a phenomenological @xmath15 model that contains extra @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons , which mix with the sm @xmath13 and @xmath14 bosons , respectively .",
    "thus , it can induce the decays of @xmath198 and @xmath199 to explain the atlas anomaly in the diboson channels , while we interpreted the excess in @xmath2 as a fluctuation or a substantial overlap with @xmath200 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is very difficult for a spin-1 boson to decay significantly into @xmath2 .",
    "we have applied the constraints of the total width of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons , dijet cross sections , @xmath0 and @xmath200 cross sections , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 cross sections for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons , respectively , as well as qualitatively the ew precision constraints on the parameter space of @xmath17 and the mixing angles @xmath41 and @xmath25 .",
    "we have found a sweet spot that satisfies all the constraints , and there exists a viable region that can explain the excess in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels , respectively .",
    "the size of the mixing angle is @xmath201 and the size of the coupling @xmath202 .",
    "we offer comments on our findings and other possibilities as follows .    1 .",
    "the production of @xmath0 and @xmath200 via @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons receives a large enhancement due to the longitudinal polarization of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 boson ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "if each boson - jet system ( which contains 2 closely separated jets ) is boosted back to the rest frame of the @xmath113 boson and the angle made by the jet is measured , one may be able to tell the polarization of the @xmath113 boson .",
    "another important channel to check is the semileptonic decays of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bosons , i.e. , one boson decays leptonically while the other hadronically .",
    "though the event rates will be lowered , the @xmath13 or @xmath14 peak can be easier distinguished .",
    "3 .   as we have mentioned that it is very difficult to have a spin-1 boson to decay into @xmath2 at tree level .",
    "there are only two effective operators describing such vertex @xcite , one of which may be induced by anomaly associated with the extra @xmath204 while the other must be cp violating .",
    "the logical choice is spin-0 or spin-2 .",
    "however , the production of spin-0 boson , just like the sm higgs boson , has to go through @xmath205 fusion or @xmath200 fusion .",
    "the production cross sections are too small or the total decay width of the boson is too broad .",
    "the spin-2 boson , e.g , the graviton kaluza - klein state of the randall - sundrum model , can decay into @xmath200 and @xmath2 , but in the atlas report @xcite it was shown that the production rate of the spin-2 graviton is somewhat too small to explain the anomaly .",
    "another possibility is an extended higgs sector .",
    "it is well - known that in models with extra higgs doublets the charged higgs can not couple to @xmath0 at tree - level .",
    "it has to go beyond the doublet to e.g. triplet models .",
    "one viable triplet model is the georgi - machacek model @xcite that contains neutral , singly - charged , and doubly - charged higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "the excess in @xmath200 channel did not distinguish between @xmath1 and @xmath206 .",
    "in particular , the doubly and singly charged @xmath207 and @xmath208 can be copiously produced via vector - boson fusion for higgs - boson mass at 2 tev , but however the width of the bosons are too broad to be consistent @xcite . 5 .",
    "another alternative is the strong dynamics @xcite , e.g. , technicolor models .",
    "for example , a neutral @xmath209 of 2 tev can decay into @xmath1 while a charged @xmath210 of 2 tev can decay into @xmath7 .",
