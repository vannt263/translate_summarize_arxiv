    "the recent dasi power spectrum is measured from the single pointing observation without platform rotation ( halverson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the dasi band powers have the resolution of @xmath377 ( with 18  28% anti - correlations ) , which is broader than the resolution limit @xmath378 where @xmath379 .",
    "we expect that the dasi single pointing observation with dense rotation of platform will allow higher resolution of about @xmath380 at the similar level of anti - correlations . since the mosaicking is the most efficient method for increasing the resolution of the power spectrum , the combination of mosaicking and dense rotation of the platform followed by the @xmath4-pixelization is thought to be the most ideal observational strategy for dasi- and cbi - type cmb interferometers .    for each observational strategy ,",
    "optimal parameter choices for the amiba experiment are discussed in @xmath18 , and summarized in table 3 .",
    "the 7-element amiba is expected to detect cmb polarization power spectrum near @xmath381 at @xmath269 level within 20 days by observing 43 fields . in amiba mosaicking with @xmath302 months , the optimal parameter sets are ( @xmath382 , @xmath383 ) or ( @xmath384 , @xmath305 ) for a minimum uncertainty of the @xmath9-polarization power spectrum .",
    "in fact , the optimal parameters strongly depend on the characteristics of the interferometer ( e.g. , @xmath385 , @xmath386 , and @xmath98 ) and on the @xmath9-polarization power spectrum @xmath132 .",
    "since we are considering the shortest baselines in deriving the parameters , the optimization is only for the sensitivity range of the shortest baselines ( @xmath222 ) . at higher",
    "@xmath0-range ( @xmath387 ) where the 7-element amiba has only a few baselines , the cmb polarized signal is expected to be very low .",
    "therefore , we have chosen a wider band width for the last band for the @xmath303 mosaicking and drift - scanning observations ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . to obtain a meaningful polarization power spectrum at high @xmath0 region with narrow band widths",
    ", we need to increase the integration time or the number of baselines .",
    "this can be seen in the simulation of the 19-pointing mosaicking by amiba where the integration time per pointing is almost one day ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "although the band widths are quite wide in the temperature power spectra in figure 6 , we can measure temperature band powers independently with narrower band width because the signal - to - noise ratios of the @xmath11 visibilities are very high , compared with those of polarization ( @xmath388 , see open circles in fig .",
    "6@xmath328 ) .    among the three observational strategies that we have studied",
    ", the single pointing is useful for a detection of the cmb polarized signal while the mosaicking or the drift - scanning of a large area of the sky is essential for measuring the polarization power spectrum with high @xmath209-resolution .",
    "the drift - scanning strategy is efficient for removing the ground contamination .",
    "it can also save half of the integration time when compared to the method of differencing two fields in the removal of the ground spillover adopted by the cbi experiment ( padin et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the drift - scanning",
    ", the survey region can have a shape for which the flat - sky approximation is inapplicable .",
    "since the survey area drift - scanned by the amiba interferometer will be over 100 deg@xmath333 , it is necessary to take into account the curvature of the sky . our future work will deal with important issues such as the removal of galactic foreground emission , the identification of radio point sources , and the subtraction of unresolved point sources .",
    "it is also important to study the topology of the cmb temperature and polarization fields to test the primordial fluctuations for gaussianity ( see , e.g. , park & park 2002 ) .",
