    "granular size separation is one of the most prominent phenomena in granular physics @xcite",
    ". when a granular mixture is agitated via an external driving force , grains of different sizes separate into distinct regions of the container .",
    "this behavior sets granular materials apart from ordinary fluids which typically mix to increase entropy .",
    "a key reason is that granular media are far from thermal equilibrium , and that therefore the dynamics set up by the driving force govern their behavior .",
    "the phenomenon of granular size separation is well known .",
    "it manifests itself in a wide array of granular systems such as chute flows , avalanches and rotating drums @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on a vertically vibrated bed in which a large spherical object , the `` intruder '' , is embedded .",
    "the excitation typically causes the intruder to rise to the top of the bed , which is commonly referred to as the brazil nut effect @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed behavior is more complex . in particular the rate of rising is strongly density dependent and in some experiments light intruders have been found to sink @xcite .",
    "efforts to identify the underlying mechanism for the intruder motion have been stymied by the need to account for this wide variety of behaviors @xcite .",

    "a vacuum gauge measures the background air pressure inside the cylinder.,width=192 ]    until recently , the rising or sinking of an intruder has been treated as distinct phenomena .",
    "although the interstitial fluid , typically air , has been shown to strongly influence this density dependent behavior of the intruder @xcite , the details of how it acts and whether it is the cause of this behavior have only been resolved recently @xcite . while some reports have suggested that air is unimportant @xcite , others acknowledged its role in determining the intruder motion @xcite , but gave conflicting explanations .",
    "there have also been studies of closely related systems with multiple intruder , quasi 2d and bi - disperse systems @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a systematic study of the effect of air on size separation in a three - dimensional , single intruder system and expands on a letter published earlier @xcite . in general ,",
    "size separation is caused by a variety of mechanisms ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "our system was chosen such that convection is the dominant transport mechanism in the absence of air .",
    "the separation mechanism is identified by employing magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and high speed video .",
    "this allows us to map out in detail the dependence on system parameters and to establish a phase diagram that delineates the rising and sinking regimes .",
    "we then develop a model that can explain the key features of our results and also provides a unifying framework for seemingly conflicting or unconnected observations made in the literature .",
    "in particular , it shows the sinking and rising to originate from the same mechanism .",

    "the frequency of the excitations was typically fixed at @xmath7 hz although we explored ranges between 10 and 30 hz with no qualitative change in the results .",
    "we used different types of media to study the effect of density : glass ( @xmath8 g / ml , mosci corp . ) , zirconium oxide ( @xmath9 g / ml , glen mills ) , dvb resin ( @xmath10 g / ml , supelco ) , tapioca pearls ( @xmath11 g / ml ) , poppy and rajagara seeds ( @xmath10 and @xmath12 g / ml , respectively ) . here , @xmath13 is the density of the bed particle _ material_. the range of sizes we used as our bed medium was between @xmath14 and @xmath15 mm .",
    "the intruder particles were @xmath16 mm hollow polypropylene spheres ( euro - matic plastics inc . ) filled with varying amounts of material such as lead shot to tune the density .",
    "the intruder was placed along the cylinder axis at height @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) . after each run ,",
    "the cell was emptied and refilled to avoid compaction effects .",
    "two different cells were used : one had a smooth inner wall , the other was roughened by gluing glass beads to its surface , thus allowing us to study the effect of wall - driven convection on the intruder motion @xcite . during the experiments",
    "the cylinder was closed with a lid that had a pressure gauge and quick release valve mounted on it .",
    "the cell could be evacuated to pressures between @xmath17 and @xmath18 kpa .",
    "the vacuum pump was then disconnected via the valve to avoid vibrations caused by dangling tubes .",
    "a thin plastic straw attached to the intruder that extended above the bed surface enabled us to track the intruder motion inside the bed .",
    "we recorded the motion of the straw with a high - speed video camera to measure the intruder trajectory during the shaking cycle as well as the net displacement of the intruder after each tap .",
    "measurements of the rise time with and without the straw did not show any difference within experimental accuracy ..    two different techniques were employed to probe the interior of the three - dimensional particle bed .",
    "one of them involved non - invasive magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .",

    "once the system has settled we take a mri snapshot , imaging a vertical slice through the center . from the displacement of the bands between taps",
    "we can then deduce the flow field .",
    "while the size and density differences between the two types of seeds is small , it is not clear a priori that they do not matter .",
    "the poppy seeds are kidney shaped whereas the rajagara ones are more spherical , although both are of comparable size ( @xmath19 mm ) . in order to ensure that our mri results are unaffected by these differences and hold for media other than seeds",

    "the flow field at later times was obtained by carefully backfilling the cell with water , freezing it and then cutting it along the central axis .",
    "_ convective flow patterns_. since convection plays an important role in granular size separation in systems such as ours @xcite , we first investigated the convective flow .",
    "there are two types of convection patterns we observe - one is symmetric and the other asymmetric ( fig . [ convection ] ) . for glass media the symmetric roll is observed with @xmath20 mm in the smooth cell and @xmath21 mm in the rough cell .",
    "this is the well known wall - driven convection roll @xcite that has a thin downstream region near the walls and a large upstream flow in the center of the bed [ fig .",
    "[ convection](a ) ] .",
    "small background media , in which air effects are more pronounced due to the lower bed permeability , undergo the asymmetric convection despite careful leveling procedures .",
    "we found this asymmetric behavior for all glass media with diameters @xmath22 mm in the smooth and @xmath23 mm in the rough cell . in this case",
    "a surface instability caused by air flow dominates the wall - driven convection and a large convection roll spanning the entire diameter of the cell sits on top of a small one [ fig .",

    "@xcite proposed a different model for the formation of the peak in the rise time versus @xmath24 .",
    "they suggest that the peak results from a competition between convection and inertia effects , both of which should also occur in vacuum . however , in our experiments the density dependence always vanished at low pressures .",

    "the reason why air is still important for these relatively large and porous media is that tapioca is a very light material ( @xmath157 g / ml ) and much more susceptible to drag forces than glass beads ( @xmath158 g / ml ) of comparable size .",
    "the literature on granular size separation mainly deals with two systems : the single intruder on one hand and binary mixtures which separate into two phases on the other hand . in the former system",
    "the interaction is only between the intruder and the bed , while in binary mixtures the interactions between the particles that make up one species need to be taken into account as well . in a model proposed by hong and coworkers @xcite the separation of binary mixtures",
    "depends on the granular temperatures of each species .",
    "the species with the larger diameter condenses at the bottom of the container - the so - called reverse brazil nut effect - if @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the densities of the small and large species , respectively .",
    "this model was shown to be in agreement with a recent experiment on separating binary mixtures @xcite with particle diameters in the range @xmath162 mm .    in order to test for the onset of interactions between multiple intruders in our system we investigated cases of up to nine intruders in a variety of initial geometrical arrangements .",

    "moreover , the intruders moved as a compound with rise times that did not show any appreciable difference to our single intruder experiment .",
    "this held independently of the initial spatial arrangement of multiple intruders .",
    "this result has two implications : if the model proposed by hong et al .",
    "@xcite were applicable , then many more intruders are needed to establish a granular temperature that gives rise to condensation at the bottom . secondly ,",
    "in the regime of our experiment the size ratio @xmath105 is not the only relevant parameter and air effects clearly can not be neglected .",
    "the experimentally established connection between the density dependent rise times and the presence of pressure gradients during shaking can be understood using a simple model that we develop in this section .",
    "this model takes into account the interactions between the bed , the intruder and the air flow during each shaking cycle and enables us to deduce the net displacement of the intruder after each tap . in the next section",
    "we will incorporate the model into a simulation to provide a more quantitative comparison to our experimental results .",
    "each shaking cycle is divided into two parts : during part i , the bed lifts off the bottom of the cell and a gap beneath opens up .",
    "the low - pressure region formed at the bottom causes air to flow down . as a result",
    "the bed and the intruder experience a downward force .",
    "smaller media with lower permeability increase that air drag . the second part of the cycle starts when the gap starts to close again , the pressure gradient reverses sign and air flows upwards until the bed hits the bottom of the cell @xcite .",
    "let us now make some simplifying assumptions : we treat the bed as a porous solid with a constant packing fraction @xmath166 ; any gap caused by relative motion between intruder and bed is immediately filled up ; the pressure gradients created during the shaking cycle do not depend on the position within the bed ; horizontal pressure dependence due to the presence of walls is negligibly small ; finally , we do not consider convection .    within this model the vertical pressure gradient across the bed",
    "is governed by darcy s law @xmath167 where @xmath97 is the permeability of the bed , @xmath168 the viscosity of the interstitial fluid and @xmath169 the fluid velocity outside the bed .",
    "the pressure @xmath170 is a function of time and the vertical coordinate @xmath171 only . using eq.([darcy ] )",
    "we find the drag force on the bed medium @xmath172 and intruder @xmath173 : @xmath174 @xmath175 in the last integral we used the assumption that @xmath176 is a function of time only .",
    "this drag term , @xmath173 , has been used before to describe the effect of air on a particle in a vibrated bed @xcite . comparing @xmath172 and @xmath173 ,",
    "it is clear that the bed and the intruder experience the same acceleration when @xmath177 .",
    "we now compare this drag force and the viscous drag acting on the intruder . the viscous drag in laminar flow",
    "is given by stokes formula : @xmath178 in our setup , @xmath179 m , @xmath180 m / s and @xmath181 ranges from @xmath54 to @xmath182 g , so @xmath183 ranges from @xmath184 to @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , we can safely ignore simple stokes drag on the intruder .",
    "the viscous drag on the bed has been accounted for in darcy s law , where the bed is treated as a continuous porous block .",
    "the intruder is also subject to the force due to pressure gradients as shown in equation ( [ fint ] ) .",
    "the typical gradients in our bed with @xmath54 mm glass bead during the shaking cycle can be estimated from darcy s law ( [ darcy ] ) : @xmath186 pa / m using @xmath187 pa s for air and the carman - kozeny relation for the permeability of a random packed bed of spheres @xcite @xmath188 therefore @xmath189 is between @xmath190 to @xmath191 .",
    "even though stokes drag does not influence the intruder appreciably , the forces due to pressure gradients are substantial .",
    "it is useful to estimate the effective acceleration acting on the bed in part i. the apex of an object s trajectory on which a constant drag force @xmath192 acts and an initial velocity @xmath193 is given by @xmath194 , where @xmath195 after substituting ( [ fdb ] ) .    substituting @xmath196 kg/@xmath197 for glass , a typical packing fraction @xmath198 and @xmath199 m / s we obtain @xmath200 m/@xmath201 , close to the acceleration of the light intruder in figs .",

    "we expect the intruder at density @xmath44 to have the same acceleration as well in part i , since it moves with the bed .",
    "this is indeed the case as shown in fig .",
    "[ velocities](a ) .",
    "the intruder has the same acceleration before it slows down in part ii .",
    "the slow down is not as abrupt as for the light intruder .    at density @xmath202",
    "the accelerations of the intruder and the bed are the same , so there will be no relative motion . in order to illustrate the consequences of air drag on different density intruders it is instructive to look at the two parts of the cycle for an extremely light and heavy intruder .",
    "part i : if @xmath154 , the downward acceleration on the bed is greater than for the intruder as shown by naylor et al . @xcite .",
    "the intruder will push the bed above it .",
    "the closer the intruder is to the surface the less material it has to displace . if @xmath148 , the intruder will be pushed against the bed below it .",
    "two things can now happen : if the intruder is near the bottom of the bed , less material has to be displaced and the intruder can sink with respect to the bed . if the intruder is located close to the surface , the material below will block the downward motion of the intruder and it moves with the bed .",
    "part ii : for intruders with @xmath154 the time of flight is longer than for the bed .",
    "while the bed collapses the intruder is still in the upward motion with respect to the bed .",
    "the escaping air has little effect on the intruder and the void below it is filled up with bed material . by the time the trajectory of the intruder has passed its apex",
    "the bed has almost collapsed and it will have a soft landing on the bed resulting in a net upward displacement . the light intruder with @xmath148 will be accelerated upwards with respect to the bed due to its low inertia . if it is near the bottom , it can not displace much of the material above it .",
    "above the crossover height , however , it has enough inertia to displace the material above and therefore will rise with respect to the bed .",
    "the net displacement of the intruder after one shaking cycle is the sum of displacements in part i and ii .",
    "therefore , intruders with densities different than @xmath44 rise faster than convection or , for the case of light intruders started initially below a crossover height , will sink . in summary our model",
    "makes the following predictions :    * at density @xmath202 the intruder does not move with respect to the bed . in our simplified model without convection it would stay put . in reality",
    ", however , there is always some convection and the intruder will follow whatever background flow there is in the system .",
    "if the flow is symmetric wall - driven convection , then the intruder will surface in the middle of the cylinder . in the case of the asymmetric convection",
    ", the intruder will be driven to the side of the container .",
    "* at all the other densities , the intruder will experience relative motion with respect to the bed due to air drag .",
    "the intruder will push the bed above or below , depending on the relative accelerations during the cycle .",
    "the dynamics between the intruder and the bed caused by air drag enable light and heavy intruders to move faster through the bed than those at @xmath44 .",
    "* there exists a crossover height below which light intruders with @xmath203 sink .",
    "* the density dependence should vanish when the relative size @xmath105 becomes small . even though the acceleration due to the drag force on the intruder @xmath204 is independent of @xmath104 , the absolute value of its inertia decreases with @xmath205 .",
    "therefore smaller intruders displace less bed than larger ones with the same acceleration .",
    "intruders with small size ratio @xmath105 rise with convection as is evident in fig .",
    "[ diffsize](a ) .",
    "this is also the reason why knight et al .",
    "@xcite did not observe any deviation from convection when they measured intruder rise times .",
    "all their intruders had a relative size @xmath206 . *",
    "the validity of this model is independent of the phase of the sine wave excitation . in general , this is true for any excitation in which the acceleration exceeds @xmath152 and therefore causes the bed to lift off .",
    "whenever a gap opens up , the air flows downward , independent of whether the cell moves up or down at that point .",
    "consequently , any excitation can be delineated into two phases in which the air flows down first and then up .",
    "a consequence of these considerations is the existence of a crossover height . from symmetry arguments",
    "one would naively expect it to be in the middle of the bed . however , convection and fluidization of the upper layers cause an upwards bias in the intruder motion . moreover , the inertia of the intruder breaks the symmetry . despite the total impulse during the cycle due to drag being close to zero",
    ", there will still be a net movement . even if the intruder did not collide with the bed during flight it would not return to its initial position .",
    "this is due to the different initial velocities at the beginning of part i and part ii of the cycle .",
    "these factors explain why the crossover height is usually not in the middle of the bed .    despite explaining main features of the separation mechanism the model fails to account for some of our observations .",
    "one is the decrease of @xmath44 with decreasing pressure ( figs .",
    "[ roughpeaknphase ] and [ smoothpeaknphase ] ) .",
    "even though @xmath207 , it is unlikely that @xmath166 would decrease to below @xmath33 .",
    "one possible explanation is that the pressure gradients are not spatially uniform at lower pressures . in this case equation ( [ fint ] ) would no longer hold .",
    "another feature of the data the model does not capture is the non - monotonic behavior of the crossover height @xmath91 as a function of pressure ( insets of figs .",
    "[ roughpeaknphase ] and [ smoothpeaknphase ] ) .",
    "in order to test key aspects of our model we performed a numerical simulation .",
    "in particular the computation of the pressure distribution in the bed during one shaking cycle sheds light on one main assumption in the model : the linear change of pressure with depth at all times .    the starting point is the gutman model @xcite for the motion of a vibrated porous bed .",

    "light intruders , on the other hand , are more easily buffeted by the air currents flowing through the bed ; if placed initially near the bottom , this can push the intruder downward , whereas if placed near the top the intruder can get driven toward the upper surface .",
    "however , we can not explain the decrease of @xmath44 as the pressure is lowered in the framework of our model .",
    "this might be due to simplifying assumptions , such as constant packing fraction , lack of fluidization and intruder penetration . despite the fact that our model can not account for all the rich details this experiment yields",
    ", it does unify previously disjointed pieces of data , mainly the rising and sinking of light intruders .",
    "the air driven size separation is a non - equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "the different dynamics during the two parts of the shaking cycle explain the observed results .",
    "even though our studies concentrated on the single intruder situation , similar considerations can be made for multi intruders and binary mixtures where the size difference is large and the bed permeability is small .",
