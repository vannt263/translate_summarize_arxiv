    "granular dampers ( or particle dampers , pds ) are devices aimed at the attenuation of mechanical vibrations by exploiting the dissipative character of the interaction between macroscopic particles .",
    "a pd consists in a number of particles ( grains ) enclosed in a receptacle that is attached or embedded in a vibrating structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the motion of the grains inside the enclosure , as the structure vibrates , is able to dissipate part of the energy through the non - conservative collisions , so reducing the vibration amplitude .",
    "this emerging technology can replace the widely used viscous and viscoelastic dampers in particular applications where extreme temperatures ( either low or high ) are involved or where low maintenance is required .",
    "the leading sector in this regard is the aerospace industry @xcite .",
    "however , the automotive @xcite and oil and gas @xcite industries are catching up in recent years .",
    "pds are the descendant of the older impact dampers designed to operate by the use of a single body inside an enclosure @xcite .",
    "pds are now preferred over impact dampers due to the lower noise level they produce .",
    "the performance of a pd depends on a number of design characteristics such as the relative size and shape of the particles and the enclosure , the total weight @xmath0 of the particles , the number @xmath1 of grains , the working vibration intensity and frequency , etc .",
    "these have been studied to some extent in the last two decades @xcite . however",
    ", less attention has been paid to the role that the grain - grain interaction plays in these systems .    in this paper , we show that the response of a pd is independent of the particle - particle interaction to the extent that even friction or inelastic collisions can be suppressed without altering the vibration attenuation .",
    "this effect is explained in terms of the effective zero restitution of the granular system caused by the effective _ inelastic collapse _ @xcite",
    ". the inelastic collapse in dense granular materials refers to the effect by which the system can dissipate its entire kinetic energy in a short finite time even if collisions have a very high restitution coefficient . in dense systems",
    ", the number of collisions grows so rapidly that even a minute dissipation in each collision suffices to make the system as a whole fully dissipative .",

    "as it is to be expected , eliminating both , the normal and tangential dissipative part of the interaction converts the system into a conservative molecular - like system which yields no attenuation of the response [ see diamonds in fig . [ fig3](a ) ] . in this case",

    "[ fig3](c ) , where the response of the system with @xmath46 at the resonant frequency is considered , increasing @xmath48 at constant @xmath49 leads to an increase in the energy dissipated though the collisional mode .",
    "the converse is true if the frictional parameter @xmath49 is increased [ see fig . [ fig3](d ) ] .",
    "however , the total dissipated energy remains constant even if @xmath48 or @xmath49 drops to zero .",
    "hence , the system is able to dissipate the same amount of energy irrespective of the dissipation modes available to the particles .",
    "we speculate that this universal response is found whenever a large number of particles is used and the motion of the granular bed is set into a more or less dense lumped mass , as oppose to a gas - like state . for a dense granular layer , the number of collisions per unit time as the bed collides with the boundaries increases dramatically due to an effective inelastic collapse @xcite .",
    "although _ inelastic collapse",
    "_ refers to a mathematical divergence of the number of collisions per unit time when instantaneous interactions are considered , real systems do also exhibit a remarkable increases in the collision rate @xcite .",
    "the behavior of such granular systems has been recently proven to be well modeled by a single mass @xmath51 with an effective zero restitution coefficient and no frictional properties @xcite . also , recent simulations with no frictional components where able to fit experimental data on pds in microgravity @xcite .",
    "this fact that friction can be neglected is evidenced in fig . [ fig3](d ) .",
    "however , according to fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , restitution can also be set to unity and any non - vanishing friction will suffice to render the universal frf shown in fig . [",
    "fig3](a ) .",
    "this indicates that a much wider set of interactions can lead to the effective inelastic collapse than previously shown .",
    "we have solved a simple one - dimensional model where a single particle of mass @xmath0 and zero restitution coefficient moves between the floor an ceiling .",
    "the model is adapted from @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figs . [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) with black solid lines .",
    "it is clear that such simple model provides the essence to describe the pd .",
    "hence , design can be based in this simple model without worrying about a careful selection of the particle properties .",
    "previous workers have used slightly more complicated models where the restitution coefficient was used as a fitting parameter @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that this complication may be unnecessary .",
    "we now turn into surveying the limits of this universal response .",
    "inelastic collapse is known to take place only if a large number of grains at high densities are considered .",
    "therefore , we can set the system into a regime where this universal response does not apply by reducing @xmath1 or by promoting a diluted granular state in the enclosure .     at resonance as a function of the collisional dissipation @xmath48 for @xmath41 kgm@xmath30s@xmath14 for different number @xmath1 of grains in the enclosure ( see legend ) .",

    "[ fig4 ] , we present the variation of the amplitude of vibration @xmath53 at the resonant frequency as a function of the normal [ fig . [ fig4](a ) ] and tangential [ fig . [ fig4](b ) ] dissipative parameters for different @xmath1 . for these simulations , we have changed the diameter of the particles in order to keep the total mass @xmath0 of the grains constant as @xmath1 is changed . for @xmath54 , a constant ( _ universal _ ) response",
    "is recovered , whereas smaller systems present a better attenuation as any of the two dissipative properties ( @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) is increased , in accord with intuition .",
    "these results confirm the speculation that the universal response only applies if a relatively large number of particles is involved .",
    "of course , the values of @xmath1 at which this universal response is reached will depend on the horizontal size of the enclosure .",
    "we estimate from our simulations that whenever the enclosure is filled with three or more layers of particles the system response near resonance becomes independent of the particle  particle interaction .    a way to induce a gas - like behavior of the granular sample in the enclosure so as to create a dilute regime where an effective inelastic collapse is not expected is to increase the height of the cavity . in fig . [ fig5](a ) and ( b ) we plot the energy dissipated per cycle as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath49 for an enclosure with @xmath55 m . for this large @xmath10 ,",
    "the granular sample expands significantly and does not move as a lumped mass , so reducing dramatically the number of collisions per unit time .",
    "the final results is an effective dissipation that depends on the particle  particle dissipative interaction .",
    "interestingly , in this regime , increasing @xmath48 or @xmath49 leads to a decrease of the total energy dissipated .",
    "since pds are designed to optimize attenuation in a number of applications , the size of the enclosure generally promotes the dense lumped mass motion of the grains inside @xcite .",
    "therefore , in many working conditions of interest , the system will be in a regime where the universal frf is obtained .",

    "we have shown that a basic phenomenon ( inelastic collapse ) leads to a universal response of a pd in the sense that the particle  particle interaction becomes irrelevant .",
    "this allowed us to determine the limits of this universality : relatively large numbers of particles must be used and the system has to be set in a state of dense lumped mass .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the particular contact force model used for the simulations is of little relevance to the results presented here .",
    "we have shown that a much simplistic model ( the zero - restitution - single - particle model ) also shows the same response .",
    "indeed , the proposed universality implies that details of the interactions are not relevant .",
    "moreover , despite our studies being done on a system vibrating in the direction of gravity , we expect results will apply to horizontally vibrating pds .    this universal response is consistent with some observations in experiments and simulations where a few values of the material properties where tested @xcite and can explain the unexpected agreement between simplified models and complex experiments @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that powders , as opposed to granulars , may not follow this universal response even at resonance .",
    "powders are fine graded particles and the effects of the hydrodynamics of the surrounding air affects the motion of the particles to a large extent .",
    "fine powders will expand due to air - particle interactions and the inelastic collapse will be unlikely . some preliminary experiments with pds using fine powders seem to confirm this @xcite .",
    "the suitability of pds to work in harsh environments can be understood as a consequence of this phenomenon .",
    "extreme temperatures and pressures may induce mild changes in frictional properties , but these will not alter the pd response . more importantly ,",
    "degradation of the particles during operation due to wear , deformation and fragmentation are not likely to compromise the pd performance .",
    "changes in friction or restitution are unimportant .",
    "although we have not studied particles of different shapes , we speculate that fragments of particles may be as effective as the original particles as long as they are not fine graded .",
    "moreover , fragmentation can only increase @xmath1 , which should not take the system out of the universal frf .",
    "this is the underlying phenomenon that explains the characteristic low maintenance required for this devices .",
    "notice however that very high temperatures may weld particles together inducing an effective reduction of @xmath1 which can reduce vibration attenuation .",
    "design of pds can be greatly simplified by choosing to work with large @xmath1 and using a simple model such as the zero restitution single mass used here . under these conditions ,",
