    "neutral helium has interesting atomic structure that makes it a useful astrophysical tool .",
    "the 2s level of the triplet state is metastable with a lifetime of 2.2 hours , and it acts as a second ground state .",
    "the 2s level lies 19.75  ev above the ground state , so it is populated by recombination .",
    "it is depopulated predominantly by collisions in photoionized gas .",
    "this means that he  i * absorption measures the he@xmath3 column , and hei * absorption occurs along with other high - ionization absorption lines including c  iv , si  iv , and p  v.    it has been known for @xmath415 years that many quasar absorption lines are saturated but not black because the absorber only partially covers the continuum source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "so , to estimate column densities , one needs absorption lines that are not easily saturated , i.e. , from rare ions .",
    "then , two or more transitions from the same lower level have ratios fixed by atomic physics , and measurements of optical depths of lines from such transitions can be used to solve for the covering fraction .",
    "phosphorus is a low - abundance element ( 765 times less abundant than carbon ) .",
    "the pv resonance doublet at 1118 and 1128 is a good probe of high - column outflows @xcite .",
    "although helium is abundant in astronomical gas , he  i * is rare .",
    "one of every @xmath4175,000 he@xmath3 atoms is he  i * in a typical plasma @xcite .",
    "the he  i*@xmath510830 ( 2s@xmath62p ) and he  i*@xmath53889 ( 2s@xmath63p ) lines are suitable for measuring the he@xmath3 covering fraction and column density . as shown in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , he  i * has very similar opacity as p   v. but he  i * has the added advantage that it is observable from the ground in the optical and ir in low redshift objects .",
    "he  i * has another important advantage over other lines .",
    "a line s opacity is proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the oscillator strength .",
    "so the optical depth ratio of two transitions from the same level is equal to the @xmath7 ratio .",
    "this ratio is @xmath42 for hydrogen - like resonance doublets ( including p  v ) .",
    "in contrast , the ratio of @xmath7 for he  i*@xmath510830 to he  i*@xmath53889 is 23.3 .",
    "this means that these two lines provide a large dynamic range for measuring the spatially - averaged optical depth . specifically , he  i*@xmath0 is sensitive to lower column densities , and he  i*@xmath9 takes over at higher column densities .",
    "simulations show that the average column density can be accurately recovered over almost 2.5 orders of magnitude ( * ? ? ?",
    "we observed fbqs  j1151@xmath103822 ( z=0.3344 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) in march 2008 using spex on the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) as part of another project .",

    "absorption from he  i * at 3889 is not obvious in fbqs  j1151@xmath103822 because of strong fe  ii emission .",

    "high densities violate the balmer absorption upper limit .",
    "the column densities estimated for fbqs  j1151@xmath103822 are comparable to or larger than those from several objects presented by @xcite ( also obtained using partial covering analysis ) .",
    "this demonstrates the sensitivity of he  i * to high column densities .",
    "we observed fbqs  j1151@xmath103822 in may 2011 at the kpno 4-meter telescope using the rc spectrograph .",
    "we detected , for the first time , a broad absorption feature shortward of the mg  ii emission line ( fig .",
    "[ mgii ] ; lucy et al . in prep . ) .",
    "clearly , mg  ii absorption is present in the spectrum .",
    "we conclude that absorption from fe  ii and excited state fe  ii is also present .",
    "we construct absorption profiles for mg  ii and fe   ii using the he  i*@xmath510830 profile , thereby assuming that all of these lines are produced in the same gas ( the justification for this assumption will be discussed in lucy et al .  in prep .",
    "the fe  ii divides nicely into ground state and low ionization lines ( @xmath18 ) , and higher ionization lines ( 26002750 ) .",
    "we fit the spectrum with these profiles ( fig .",
    "[ mgii ] ) . integrating over the resulting apparent optical depths yields apparent log column densities of 15.0 , 14.6 and 13.7 [ @xmath14 for mg  ii , ground and low - excitation fe  ii , and high excitation fe  ii , respectively . for shallow features like the fe  ii features , @xcite",
    "show that the spatially - averaged column is approximately equal to the column obtained from the apparent optical depth .    our measurements of mg  ii and fe  ii place new strong constraints on the ionization parameter and therefore the column density .",
    "[ cloudy ] shows _ cloudy _ simulations of column densities of he  i * , mg@xmath3 and fe@xmath3 .",
    "we find that sufficient mg  ii is produced for @xmath19 .",
    "however , sufficient fe@xmath3 is attained only at @xmath20 , where he  i * is ionization bounded ( i.e. , the he  i * predicted in a semi - infinite slab is equal to the measured value ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the atomic properties of mg and fe . in the h  ii region , mg@xmath3 and fe@xmath3",
    "are produced by recombination .",
    "the + 2@xmath6 + 3 ionization potential for mg is high , 80.1  ev , which means that there is plenty of mg@xmath21 , and therefore mg@xmath22 in the h  ii region , more than enough to create the observed broad absorption line .",
    "but the similar ionization potential for fe is 30.7  ev , implying that iron is distributed among many ionization states in the h  ii region .",
    "this means that a much higher column is needed to observe fe  ii compared with mg  ii .",
    "therefore , the difference between lobals ( objects with only mg  ii ) and felobals ( objects that also have fe  ii ) may be simply a difference in column density along the line of sight .",
    "the strongly - constrained ionization parameter provides strong constraints for the column density as well .",
    "for example , for log gas density @xmath23 [ @xmath24 , _ cloudy",
    "_ models for he   i * and fe  ii match the measured values of those components where @xmath25 [ @xmath14 . mg  ii far exceeds the measured value at this column density , implying that the mg  ii line is saturated .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is constrained to be between 5.0 and 7.5 by the lack of balmer absorption and the presence of excited state fe  ii .",
    "if we assume that the outflow is accelerated by radiative line driving , @xcite show that @xmath27 .",
    "this constrains @xmath28 [ @xmath14 , the absorption - line gas radius of 1221  pc , mass flux between 18 and 31 solar masses / yr , log kinetic luminosity between 44.2 and 44.45 [ @xmath29 , and ratio of kinetic to bolometric luminosity to between 0.3 and 0.5% .",
    "@xcite postulate that a ratio of kinetic to bolometric luminosity as low as 0.5% may be sufficient to truncate star formation in agn host galaxies . in that case , the outflow displayed in fbqs 1151 + 3822 may be just sufficient .",
    "he  i * has been shown to be a powerful probe of high - column - density outflows in low redshift quasars .",
    "high column outflows are interesting because they may carry the most kinetic energy , and they potentially provide the greatest challenges to acceleration models .",
    "low redshift objects are interesting since they provide potentially valuable targets for imaging .",
    "furthermore , he  i * lines can be observed from the ground , which means that uniform samples can be identified and studied .",
    "we have several followup projects in progress .",
    "using irtf , we observed a small sample of low - redshift quasars known to be balqsos . some , like mrk  231 , have he  i*@xmath0 absorption , and others do not .",
    "we identified 18 low - redshift quasars that have identifiable he  i*@xmath9 in their sdss spectra , and we have observed them using lbt luci and/or gemini gnirs .",
    "this sample will allow a systematic investigation of covering fraction and column density as a function of other outflow parameters ."
