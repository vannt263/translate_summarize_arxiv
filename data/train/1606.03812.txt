    "in the spin hall effect ( she ) @xcite , the passage of an in - plane electric field in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with spin orbit interactions ( sois ) leads to the appearance of an out of plane spin accumulation .",
    "murakami @xcite and fujita @xcite , and their respective coauthors , had independently studied the she .",
    "they showed that the out of plane spin accumulation can be understood as the response of the charge carriers as their spins align adiabatically with the momentum dependent soi field .",
    "the direction of the soi field changes in time due to the change in the momentum of the charge carriers as they accelerate under the electric field .",
    "mathematically , the electric field gives to an effective magnetization term in the hamiltonian which we shall , for short , call the murakami - fujita ( mf ) potential .",
    "many emerging material systems in interest in spintronics , for example silicene @xcite and @xcite , possess discrete degrees of freedom ( dofs ) such as the pseudospin and / or valley degrees of freedom , in addition to their real spins . in this work ,",
    "we show in the following sections that the mf potential can be readily extended to incorporate these additional degrees of freedom ( dof ) which we shall for simplicity refer to collectively as pseudospin . to first order in the electric field , the mf potential accounts for the effects of a constant , in - plane electric field for the purposes of calculating spin / charge currents and spin accumulations to first order in the electric field .",
    "we illustrate the application of the mf potential on a system with a spin@xmath0pseudospin degrees of freedom through the example of the topological insulator ( ti ) thin film system @xcite . unlike a semi - infinite ti slab ,",
    "a ti thin film has both a top and a bottom surface which , due t the finite thickness , couple to each other .",
    "the low energy effective hamiltonian for can be written as @xmath1 besides the real spin denoted as @xmath2 of the charge carriers there is another discrete degree of freedom @xmath3 associated with whether the charge carriers are localized nearer the upper ( @xmath4 ) or lower ( @xmath5 ) surface of the film .",
    "the @xmath6 term then represents the coupling between the two surfaces of the film due to the finite thickness .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first revisit the emergence of the mf potential in a spin 1/2 soi system .",
    "we then generalize the mf potential to include other discrete dofs , and provide three evidences to support our claim that the mf potential accounts for the effects of the electric field in the sense that an effective hamiltonian can be constructed by replacing the @xmath7 term in the original hamiltonian can be replaced by the position-_independent _ mf potential .",
    "we first show that taking the momentum derivative of the effective hamiltonian in the heisenberg equation of motion for the position operator reproduces the usual berry curvature expression for the anomalous hall velocity . as part of their paper on the microscopic origin of spin torque @xcite , cheng ran and niu qian had extended the original sundaram - niu wavepacket formalism @xcite , which gave only the time variation of the position and momentum expectation values , to now include the time variation of the spin expectation values .",
    "we show that ran and niu s expressions for the time evolution of the spin expectation values can be readily extended to incorporate the other discrete degrees of freedom present , and that the time evolution of these operators can be derived from applying the heisenberg equation of motion to the mf potential .",
    "finally , we show that the kubo expression for non equilibrium expectation of spin@xmath0pseudospin quantities can be interpreted as the first order time independent perturbation theory response to the mf potential .",
    "we then move on to apply the mf potential formalism to study the emergence of a ti thin film system subjected to an in - plane magnetization and electric field .",
    "we first illustrate the effects of the interlayer coupling on the in - plane magnetization and the dispersion relations .",
    "we then show that the direction of the out of plane spin accumulation resulting from an in - plane electric field can be explained in terms of how the direction of the momentum dependent in - plane soi field rotates with the change in momentum direction resulting from the electric field .",
    "the anti - symmetry of the out of plane spin accumulation in @xmath8 space can be broken with the application of an out of plane electric field in order to yield a finite spin accumulation after integrating over the fermi surface .",
    "to familarize the reader with the mf potential , we first review its appearance in spin 1/2 soi systems without any additional discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "the hamiltonian for a homogenous 2deg with soi and an electric field @xmath9 in the @xmath10 direction can be generically written as @xmath11 where the @xmath12 represents a momentum dependent spin orbit interaction .",
    "we define a unitary transformation @xmath13 which diagonalizes @xmath14 in spin space so that after the unitary transformation , we have @xmath15    mathematically , the effect of @xmath16 can be interpreted as rotating the spin space coordinates so that in the rotated frame , the spin @xmath17 axis points in the direction of the soi field @xmath12 .",
    "the non commutation between @xmath10 and the momentum dependent @xmath16 results in the appearance of the @xmath18 term which acts as an effective magnetization @xmath19 in the rotated frame where the tilde on the @xmath20 indicates that the index @xmath21 refers to the @xmath21th spin direction in the rotated frame . to determine what _ lab _ frame direction this effective magnetization points in",
    ", we perform the inverse unitary transformation @xmath22 .",
    "this expression can be evaluated without an explicit form for @xmath16 . to do this , we first note that by definition @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath25   = \\partial_{k_x}\\hat{b}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in going from the first to second line , we differentiated the first line with respect to @xmath26 and then inserted @xmath27 in the appropriate places . from the last line , we use the fact that @xmath28 = i ( \\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b})\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}$ ] to conclude that @xmath29    this is the mf potential for a spin 1/2 system with an electric field in the @xmath10 direction .",
    "notice that although @xmath16 is not unique , the lab frame direction of @xmath30 is independent of the specific choice of @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath31 can then be thought as as an electric field dependent effective magnetization which confers a spin accumulation in the @xmath32 direction .",
    "taking the specific example of the rashba soi where @xmath33 both @xmath34 and @xmath35 lie on the @xmath36 plane .",
    "@xmath37 thus points in the out of plane spin direction , and confers an out of plane spin accumulation to the charge carriers    physically , the origin of the @xmath38 term can be explained by assuming that the spins of the charge carriers adiabatically follow the direction of the soi field . as shown in fig .",
    "[ ga2soifield ] , @xmath39 associates each point in @xmath8 space with a soi field pointing in the @xmath40 direction .",
    "assume that the electric field is initially switched off and consider a carrier with a definite @xmath41 .",
    "as the electric field is switched on , the field causes the charge carrier to accelerate in the direction of the field so that the momentum changes and the carrier traces out a trajectory along @xmath8 space .",
    "we assume that the electric field is weak enough so that the spin of the carrier rotates along with the direction of the soi field as it successively moves through different @xmath8 points .",
    "the resulting rotation of the spin can be thought of as being due to an effective magnetic field pointing along the @xmath42 direction which both provides the torque necessary to rotate the spin as well as confers a spin accumulation in the direction of the torque .",
    "space indicate the direction of the rashba soi field there .",
    "the application of the electric field causes the momentum of the charge carrier to trace out the trajectory in @xmath8 space indicated by the dotted line .",
    "the spin of the charge carrier adiabatically follows the direction of the soi field at each point in @xmath8 space .",
    "the rotation of the spin can be thought of as being due to an effective magnetization which both creates the torque necessary to rotate the spin as shown in the inset , as well as confers an out of plane spin accumulation . ]",
    "we now proceed to a general description of the mf potential generalized to include other discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "consider now a generic hamiltonian @xmath43 where the @xmath44s are finite sized matrices representing the discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , in a spin 1/2 system with soc , the 4 @xmath44s are the pauli matrices and the identity matrix . in the ti thin film hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ tiham1 ] the @xmath44s represent the 16 @xmath45 matrices .    in order to write the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ h0 ] as a numerical matrix , we need to express the matrix elements in terms of basis .",
    "for example , for spin 1/2 system it is common to adopt the usual representation of the pauli matrices so that , for instance @xmath46 .",
    "the numerical matrix on the rightmost side of the equal sign is written in the @xmath47 basis .",
    "we refer to the basis which @xmath48 as a ` numerical matrix ' is in as the ` laboratory frame ' with basis states @xmath49 ( @xmath50 for _ _ l__aboratory . )",
    "label now the @xmath21th eigenstates of @xmath48 by @xmath51 .",
    "we assume that the laboratory basis is fixed , i.e. it has no dependence on any parameter in the hamiltonian so that , for instance @xmath52 . instead of using the laboratory basis , we can also expand our states and operators in terms of the eigenbasis , and convert between the two basis through the unitary transformation @xmath16 . defining the @xmath16s so that @xmath53 is diagonal in the eigenbasis representation , we have @xmath54 , i.e. the matrix @xmath55th elements in the numerical representation of @xmath16 is @xmath56 .",
    "notice that since the phase factor @xmath57 can be introduced to @xmath58 arbitrarily the values of the matrix elements @xmath59 will vary with the phase of @xmath51s .",
    "now consider adding a perturbative electric field .",
    "the hamiltonian then becomes @xmath60 , and we have @xmath61 where , in this rotated frame , @xmath48 is diagonal , and we have an additional @xmath62 . in order to figure out the lab frame spin@xmath0pseudospin ` direction ' where this contribution points to , we transform the @xmath62 piece _ without the diagonal elements",
    "_ back to the laboratory frame . the reason for the removal of the diagonal elements will become apparent later . with the diagonal elements in place , we have @xmath63 .",

    "in the first half of this work , we introduced the murakami - fujita potential firstly for a spin half system and then more generally for systems with real spin coupled to other discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "we argued that the effects of a constant electric field can , to first order in the field , be modeled by replacing the electric potential @xmath7 by the murakami - fujita potential .",
    "we showed that the anomalous velocity and cheng s extension of the sundaram - niu formalism can be recovered from the heisenberg equation of motion on the mf potential , and that the result of the kubo equation for the non - equilibrium distribution of an observable be recovered by treating the mf potential as a perturbation and then using standard time - independent non - degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "this formalism can be readily applied to emerging material systems of interest to spintronics with pseudospin and / or valley degrees of freedom . as an example",
    ", we applied our formalism to study the exemplary system of a three - dimensional topological insulator thin film system where the coupling between the top and bottom surfaces presents an additional discrete degree of freedom in addition to the real spin .",
    "we showed similar to the case where the inter - layer coupling is absent , that the direction of the out of plane spin accumulation due to the application of an in - plane electric field can be predicted from the direction of the torque needed to change the direction of the spin accumulation which depends on the momentum - dependent soi field .",
    "the application of an out of plane electric field is necessary in order to break the antisymmetry of the spin accumulation .",
