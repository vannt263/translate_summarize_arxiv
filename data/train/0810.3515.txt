    "the mtcc  @xcite took place in the second half of 2006 .",
    "it was a first and successful major performance test of a small fraction of the cms detector  @xcite , including the magnet , using cosmic - ray muons as a particle beam , before it was lowered to the experimental cavern .",
    "the detector elements participating in the mtcc are shown in figure  [ setup - f1 ]  ( left ) . a cosmic muon detected in cms during the mtcc",
    "is displayed in figure  [ setup - f1 ]  ( right ) .",
    "the analysis is performed with the dts alone ( sector 10 of wheels yb+1 , yb+2 ) .",
    "the runs used in the analysis ( 5 in total ) were taken at b @xmath0 4 t , all with similar dt trigger conditions ( at least mb2+mb3 stations ) . a control sample taken at 0",
    "t is used to make detailed checks of detector performance .",
    "simulated samples ( b = 0 t and b = 4 t )  @xcite are used for cross - checks and minor corrections .",
    "the events are reconstructed using the standard reconstruction software of the cms experiment .",
    "the so - called _ standalone muon reconstruction _ was adapted for dealing with the specific spatial configurations of cosmic muons  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction procedure uses special dt calibration constants  @xcite , in order to account for the random arrival time of cosmic muons .",
    "alignment corrections  @xcite , calculated from survey data  @xcite , are applied to the measured hits before the track reconstruction .",
    "the analysis strategy is selecting a sample of high quality muons , obtaining the momentum spectra as a function of the muon charge and calculating the charge ratio as a function of the momentum .    in order to select well - reconstructed muons and avoid bias in the relative acceptance for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , caused by trigger configuration ( mb2+mb3 ) , momentum resolution and asymmetric geometrical acceptance due to magnetic field",
    ", muons are required to leave hits in at least 3 stations ( triplets / quadruplets ) , and to be fully contained in a left - right symmetric region in sector 10 of wheels yb+1 and yb+2 .",
    "figure  [ geometry - f2 ] helps understanding the influence of the geometric acceptance in the relative efficiency for @xmath1 and @xmath2 with the same momentum , entering the detector in symmetric points , and with the same angle , with respect to the vertical axis .",
    "the distributions of the momentum of the muon tracks and their azimuthal angle are shown in figure  [ selection_plots - f3 ] for quadruplet muons in the selected sample .",
    "good agreement between different runs and simulation is observed .",
    "the global cms coordinate system is used , in which the @xmath3 axis goes along the beam - line , that is , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for vertical muons .",
    "the charge ratio is computed as the ratio of the @xmath6 spectrum of @xmath1 to that of @xmath2 , as a function of the measured muon momentum ( @xmath6 ) , for all runs and their combination . a correction due to charge confusion and the estimation of systematic uncertainties",
    "are performed .",
    "the measured muon charge ratio and its statistical uncertainty is displayed in figure  [ charge_ratio_all - f4 ]  ( left ) , for quadruplets , for the individual runs analyzed .",
    "the deviations observed among different runs are consistent with statistical fluctuations .",
    "the individual systematic uncertainties on the charge ratio measurement are summarized in figure  [ charge_ratio_all - f4 ]  ( right ) , as a function of the measured muon momentum , together with the statistical error .",
    "the measurement of the charge ratio using cms data is depicted in figure  [ results - f5 ] as function of the measured muon momentum , together with the results from other experiments  @xcite .",
    "given the experimental accuracy , the charge ratio is consistent with being independent of the muon momentum in the range of study . under this assumption ,",
    "the mean value of the charge ratio , integrated over the muon momentum , is @xmath7 .",
    "good agreement with previous measurements within the experimental accuracy is observed .",

    "<S> while the mtcc itself was a crucial milestone in the cms detector construction , not having physics studies among its primary goals , it provided the first opportunity to obtain physics results and test the full analysis chain using real data in cms before the lhc startup , together with a complementary check of the detector performance . </S>"
