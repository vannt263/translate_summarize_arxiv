    "population dynamics models are useful when one tries to understand , describe or predict the behavior of a wide range of time dependent processes in several disciplines . to easily formulate and write the solutions of the population dynamics model , we present a one - parameter generalization of the logarithmic and exponential functions .",
    "this generalization has been first introduced in the context of non - extensive statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the generalized logarithm or the so - called @xmath0-_logarithm function _ is defined as : @xmath1 the natural logarithm function is retrieved for @xmath2 .",
    "the inverse of the @xmath0-logarithm function is the @xmath0-_exponential function _",
    "@xmath3 so that for @xmath4 , one retrieves the usual exponential function .",
    "the use of these functions is convenient since it has allowed us to find and simplify ( using their properties ) the solution of the models with time - dependent intrinsic and extrinsic growth rates .",
    "the simplest way to deal with population growth is to consider _ one - species models_. in these models , individuals do not explicitly interact with the external ones and , at time @xmath5 , the number of individuals is @xmath6 , with initial condition @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters are the intrinsic growth rate @xmath8 and the environment carrying capacity @xmath9 , which takes into account all possible interactions among individuals and resources  @xcite . if @xmath10 , a general model is the _",
    "von foerster et al . _",
    "model  @xcite , where the per capita growth rate is @xmath11 . considering @xmath12 as a dimensionless time unity ,",
    "the model solution is : @xmath13 $ ] , with @xmath14 and produces a population size divergence at a finite time @xmath15 , obtained from the @xmath0-exponential @xmath16  @xcite . as @xmath17 , the exponential population growth ( _ malthus _ model ) @xmath18 , with divergence at an infinite time , is obtained .",
    "the population size divergence can be dismantled considering a finite carrying capacity .",
    "the richness ecological community can not be properly described only by the one - species models .",
    "the interactions between species becomes better formalized with the ( malthus - like ) lotka - volterra equations  @xcite , which only explains prey - predator behavior in its original formulation and presents stability problems .",
    "besides the predation interaction , there are many other different kinds of interaction taking place between two biological species .",
    "for instance , if species negatively affects each other , when they occupy the same ecological niche and use the same resources , there is _",
    "competition_. if species favor each other , there is _ mutualism _ or _ symbiosis_.",
    "these ecological richness is partially appreciated in the competitive ( verhulst - like ) lotka - volterra model studied in ref .",
    "this model presents complete analytical solutions .",
    "it has a non - trivial phase diagram and solves the stability problem of the malthus - like two species model .    here",
    ", we consider a generalized two - species population dynamic model and analytically solve it for particular ecological interactions .",
    "these two - species models can be simplified to a one - species model , with a time dependent extrinsic growth factor . with a one - species model with an effective carrying capacity ,",
    "one is able to retrieve the steady state solutions of the previous one - species model .",
    "the equivalence obtained between the effective carrying capacity and the extrinsic growth factor is complete only for the gompertz model .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows : in the sec .  [ gen1 ] , the richards model is presented in terms of the generalized functions , which has the verhulst and gompertz models as particular cases .",
    "we show that the steady state solution of the richards model with extrinsic growth rate is the same for the richards model without extrinsic growth rate , but with a modified carrying capacity .",
    "also , for a particular case of the richards model ( @xmath2 ) , that is the gompertz model , not only the steady state is the same but also the whole system evolution ( transient ) . in the sec .",
    "[ gen2 ] , we present a generalized model of two interacting species . we show that the interaction between species can also be interpreted as an extrinsic growth factor .",
    "this allows one to represent a two - species system by a one - species model with a modified carrying capacity . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] , we present our final remarks .",
    "the growth of individual organisms  @xcite , tumors  @xcite and other biological systems  @xcite are well described by mathematical models considering a finite carrying capacity @xmath19 , which lead to sigmoid growth curves  @xcite . in this context , it is convenient to express the population size @xmath20 with respect to its equilibrium value , i.e. @xmath21 . the _ richards _ model  @xcite @xmath22 binds the",

    "( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and the _ verhulst _ ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) models through the @xmath0 parameter , which microscopic interpretation is given in refs .",
    "this parameter is related to the range of interaction between the individuals that compose the population and the fractal pattern of the population structure .",
    "this generalization is corroborated by several different approaches in terms of tsallis statistics @xcite and logistic equations of arbitrary order @xcite for the classical verhulst and malthus models .",

    "the richards model solution is retrieved for @xmath33 . the parameter @xmath30 plays the role of an external factor that removes or insert individuals in the population .",
    "for instance , it can be an interaction factor between different species , or the effect of the cancer treatment when one deals with tumor cells population .",
    "survival of the species is obtained when @xmath34 , and extinction occurs otherwise . the critical value @xmath35 separates the extinction from the survival phase , which behaves as @xmath36^{1/\\tilde{q}}$ ] near the critical point .",
    "this transition occurs for @xmath37 , so that only the gompertz model does not present the extinction - survival transition .    from the analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ transient_ii ] ) , we show that the insertion ( @xmath38 ) or removal ( @xmath39 ) of individuals from the population modifies the steady state solution . instead of considering the population size with respect to the medium ( bare ) carrying capacity",
    ", we propose to consider the population size with respect to a rescaled carrying capacity @xmath40 .",
    "it means that the @xmath20 population individuals live in an environmental with an effective carrying capacity @xmath41 , but now without insertion or removal of individuals .",

    "p'(\\tau ) & = & \\frac{p(\\tau)}{e_{\\tilde{q}}(\\epsilon ) } = \\frac{1}{e_{\\tilde{q}}[\\ln_{\\tilde{q}}(1/p_0')e^{-\\tau } ] } \\ ; \\label{transient3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with steady state : @xmath44 , which of course leads to : @xmath45 in the original variable .",
    "observe that the eq .",
    "( [ steady_state_iii ] ) is valid only for the survival phase , i.e. @xmath34 , otherwise @xmath41 vanishes .    comparing the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ transient_ii ] ) and  ( [ transient3 ] ) , one sees that the considered models present the same steady state solutions .",
    "nevertheless , they have different transient behavior , except for gompertz model ( @xmath46 ) , where the equivalence between the original and rescaled models is complete .",
    "the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : equivalence ] illustrate this behavior .",
    "in fact , this property comes from the argument of the exponential function : while in eq ,  ( [ transient_ii ] ) this argument is @xmath47 , in eq .",
    "( [ transient3 ] ) the argument is @xmath48 .",
    "thus the evolution of the two systems become identical only if @xmath49 . as we are dealing with @xmath50 ,",
    "the evolution of the two model is the same only when @xmath2 i.e. the gompertz model .",
    "[ transient_ii ] and  [ transient3 ] ] as a function of @xmath51 , with : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath2 ( gompertz model ) and @xmath55 ( verhulst model ) .",
    "the full equivalence of the models with extrinsic growth factor and modified carrying capacity is only obtained for the steady state solutions . nevertheless , for @xmath2 , the transient solution is also equivalent . ]",
    "here , we introduce a generalization of the verhulst - like two species model , considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we call the _ richards - like two - species model_. we consider the richards term instead of the malthus one in the original lotka - volterra equations . in this type of model ,",
    "the two species interact according to the lotka - volterra equation , however the species also suffer from inter - species competition . as in ref .",

    "the carrying capacity @xmath63 represents the restriction on resources that comes from any kind of external factors that do not have to do with species 2 and similarly for @xmath64 .",
    "time is measured with respect to the net reproductive rate of species 1 , @xmath65 .",
    "the scaled time is positive since we take the initial condition at @xmath66 .",
