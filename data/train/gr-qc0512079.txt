    "we review how , from solutions to the ` good - cut equation'@xcite for any asymptotically flat einstein or einstein - maxwell space - time , one defines the three - complex dimensional asymptotic projective twistor space@xcite , @xmath5 and its restriction to the real five - dimensional subspace of null projective twistors p@xmath6 p@xmath7 which possesses a cr structure , can then be realized as null infinity , @xmath0 with the sphere of past null directions , @xmath8 attached to each point of @xmath0 i.e. , as the sphere bundle over @xmath9 by choosing an arbitrary holomorphic curve@xcite in the solution space of the good cut equation , i.e. , in h - space , an _ asymptotically _ shear - free null geodesic congruence can be constructed . using this construction ,",
    "we show that there is an asymptotic version of the kerr theorem .",
    "this version of the theorem says that a holomorphic surface in @xmath10 that intersects with p@xmath11 produces a _",
    "regular asymptotically _ shear free null geodesic congruence in a space - time neighborhood of @xmath12 by using this version of the kerr theorem , for each choice of the arbitrary holomorphic curve , a three - dimensional cr structure is induced on @xmath12    this work can be considered as giving a generalization , to arbitrary asymptotically flat einstein - maxwell space - times , of the work of nurowski and trautman@xcite on the robinson - structures that are associated with certain specific space - times .",
    "in addition it generalizes ideas of penrose and rindler that are associated with flat twistor theory and it gives a concrete description of penrose s hypersurface twistor version of the kerr theorem@xcite but now applied to @xmath2 .",
    "we begin with an asymptotically flat , einstein or einstein - maxwell space - time @xmath13 and its associated future null infinity , @xmath14 with bondi coordinates @xmath15,@xmath16 ) and a given ( complex ) bondi shear    @xmath17    which we assume is an analytic function in its three arguments .",
    "we then consider the complexification of @xmath2 , to @xmath18 with the three independent complex coordinates @xmath15,@xmath19 with @xmath20 and the analytic extension of the shear to @xmath21 in a small neighborhood around the real @xmath12    the h - space associated with @xmath13 is the four complex dimensional solution space ( with local coordinates @xmath22 ) to the so - called ` good - cut equation'@xcite ,    @xmath23    the solutions , which can be written as @xmath24 define , for each fixed value of @xmath25 a four parameter set of complex surfaces in @xmath26 for the moment , rather than considering the solutions as surfaces in @xmath18 we consider them at a _ fixed value _ of @xmath27 and then interpret them as complex curves in the complex @xmath28 space that satisfy the second order differential equation , eq.([good cut ] ) .",
    "the solutions are defined by two initial conditions , the value of z and its first @xmath29 derivative at some _ arbitrary initial value _ of @xmath30 we take this initial value to be the complex conjugate of the value of @xmath31 i.e. , we take z and its first @xmath29 derivative at @xmath32 as the @xmath33 conditions .",
    "the initial conditions then are written as @xmath34    penrose@xcite defines projective asymptotic twistor space , @xmath35 ( a three complex ( six real ) dimensional space ) as the set of curves in @xmath36 obtained from the triple ( @xmath37 ) _ without the restriction _ of the initial @xmath29 being the complex conjugate of @xmath38 arbitrary choices of @xmath39 simply lead to arbitrary choices of coordinates for the description of @xmath40 we chose this initial value , @xmath41 for its use in the definition that penrose gives for _ null _ asymptotic twistors@xcite .    in order to define null projective twistors",
    "we point out that there are a set of dual curves ( projective dual asymptotic twistors ) defined from solutions of the complex conjugate good cut equation , namely from @xmath42 with its own set of initial conditions analogous to eqs.([u0 ] ) and ( [ l0 ] ) .",
    "one can convert the _ projective asymptotic twistors _ to _",
    "asymptotic twistors@xcite _ by introducing a rescaling parameter .",
    "we will not discuss this issue since it is not needed here .",
    "a _ null _ projective asymptotic twistor is a curve given so that the complex conjugate dual curve ( given by complex conjugate initial conditions ) has a real value for @xmath43 at @xmath44 we thus have , for a null twistor , that @xmath45 with @xmath46 at @xmath47 the space of null projective asymptotic twistors is referred to as @xmath48 this definition comes from the vanishing of a scalar product@xcite on asymptotic twistor space whose details are also not needed here .    in order to make these definitions of asymptotic twistors and asymptotic dual twistors closer to the usual definitions ,",
    "we define the asymptotic projective twistor coordinates @xmath49 from @xmath50 so that    @xmath51    the special case of flat space twistors arises when the bondi shear vanishes , i.e. when the good cut equation is @xmath52 with projective twistor curves given by the solutions , with fixed values ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 for this flat case , note that both @xmath55and @xmath56 are _ independent _ of @xmath57 so that we need not require that @xmath58    since in all that follows we will use the restricted initial point , @xmath59 we can safely drop the use of the subscript index ` 0 ' and simply write @xmath60 also since no use will made of the rescaling of the projective twistors to twistors , we will drop the adjective ` projective ' .",
    "returning to eq.([dt3 ] ) and from the definition of null asymptotic twistors , we can define the real five dimensional cr manifold , @xmath61 ( the real subspace of null twistors ) in the following fashion .",
    "@xmath62 is explicitly given parametrically in terms of the five real parameters ( @xmath63 the real and imaginary parts of @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) by    @xmath66    a representative element of the equivalence class that defines the cr structure of @xmath62 is given by the exterior derivatives of eq.([n1]),([n3 ] ) and ( [ n5 ] ) , @xmath67 which , by manipulation within the equivalence class , can be converted to @xmath68 the form @xmath69 , is real while @xmath70 and @xmath71 are complex .",
    "@xmath62 can thus be realized as the ( real ) three - dimensional @xmath72 , ( @xmath4 ) , with the two - sphere , ( @xmath73 ) , of past light - cone directions attached to each point of @xmath2 , i.e. , as the sphere bundle over real @xmath2 .",
    "a further question arises : is there a generalization of the kerr theorem from flat twistor theory to asymptotic twistor theory . for unity of presentation",
    "we first describe , in our language , the flat - space kerr theorem@xcite followed by a special case , the _ restricted _ flat - space kerr theorem .",
    "this restricted class produces regular families of asymptotically shear - free null geodesics ..    any analytic function on projective twistor space generates a shear - free null geodesic congruence in minkowski space , i.e. , from @xmath74 one can construct a shear - free null geodesic congruence in minkowski space .    geometrically , this relationship defines a function @xmath75 = @xmath76 ( a null direction field on @xmath77 which when extended into the interior of minkowski space forms a shear - free null geodesic congruence@xmath1    we consider the following special or restricted case of the kerr theorem for our later generalization . restricting ourselves to the regular solutions ( on real @xmath2 ) of the flat - space good cut equation , eq.([flatgoodcut ] ) , which are obtained by the restriction of the ( @xmath78 ) in ( [ flatsolution ] ) to be linear functions of @xmath79(see remark 2 )",
    ", we obtain the four complex parameter solution eq.([flatgoodcut ] ) @xmath80 we now chose the four parameters @xmath81 to be arbitrary complex analytic functions of a ` complex - time ' parameter , @xmath82 i.e. , @xmath83 from this it follows that both @xmath84 are functions _ only _ of ( @xmath85 ) so that by eliminating @xmath86 between them , we define , _ implicitly _ , a complex analytic function @xmath87 we refer to this class of functions as yielding the restricted kerr theorem .",
    "we thus have    every complex analytic curve , @xmath88 on the four - complex dimensional parameter space of solutions to the flat good - cut equation , eq.([flatgoodcut ] ) , determines a shear - free null geodesic congruence in minkowski space .",
    "this is accomplished by the elimination of @xmath89 between the two equations @xmath90 and @xmath91 note that these relations have a simple geometric meaning : for each point on @xmath0 i.e. , at ( @xmath92,@xmath16 ) , there is a direction on its past light - cone given by @xmath64(@xmath92,@xmath16 ) that yield the initial conditions for a null geodesic going backwards into the flat space - time producing a shear - free null geodesic congruence .",
    "the generalization of this result to asymptotic twistor theory is simple .",
    "it is known@xcite that complex analytic curves on the solution space to the good - cut equation , i.e. , on h - space , determine _",
    "asymptotically shear free null geodesic congruences _ in the neighborhood of @xmath2 of asymptotically flat space - times .",
    "in other words , given a bondi shear and the solution @xmath93 to the good - cut equation , with the arbitrary choice of the complex world - line @xmath88 the pair @xmath94 or equivalently from @xmath95 determines an asymptotically shear free null geodesic congruence .",
    "the single function , defined implicitly by the elimination of @xmath89 from this pair , ( the _ generalized restricted kerr theorem ) _ is the analogue of the restricted kerr theorem but now it determines _ asymptotically shear - free congruences_.    again , there is the same simple geometric meaning for this pair as in the corollary .    in penrose and rindler , volume ii@xcite ,",
    "there is a rather abstract discussion of hypersurface twistors and a generalized version of the kerr theorem to that situation .",
    "they remark that their version can be extended to @xmath12 it appears almost certain that our version is a restriction or subset of theirs when applied to @xmath2 .",
    "we have seen that given an arbitrary asymptotically flat einstein or einstein - maxwell space - time , we can define both a projective asymptotic twistor space and its dual space . from this pair",
    "a scalar product can be defined which allows the restriction to the five dimensional @xmath96 of projective twistors with a vanishing scalar product , i.e. , to the null twistor space @xmath97 further we saw that this restriction allows a cr structure to be defined on @xmath62 which we can identify with the sphere bundle over @xmath2 with the local ` real ' coordinates @xmath15,@xmath98 ) .    by choosing a curve , @xmath99 in h - space ,",
    "our version of the kerr theorem allows us , by choosing a cross - section of the sphere - bundle , to map the five dimensional cr manifold @xmath62 into @xmath2 . from this , @xmath2 inherits three - dimensional cr structures that are associated with each choice of h - space curve . to see this all we must do",
    "is choose @xmath75 as the function on @xmath2 given by the pair , eqs.([pair1 ] ) and ( [ pair2 ] ) , with the @xmath89 eliminated .",
    "this yields , in principle , @xmath100 with    @xmath101 the cr structure of @xmath61 i.e. , eqs.([cr1]),([cr2 ] ) and ( [ cr3 ] ) , reduces to    @xmath102    with ( @xmath73 ) given by ( [ l * ] ) .",
    "the third one - form , @xmath70 , now is a combination of @xmath69 and @xmath103 for each choice of the curve , @xmath104 we have different cr structure on @xmath12    in addition , the complex parameter @xmath89 has the meaning of a cr function and in fact the pair , ( @xmath85 ) , form the local @xmath105 whose real three - dimensional subspace is @xmath12 we thus have that @xmath106 is a locally embeddable cr manifold .",
    "the parametric form of the mapping is given by ( @xmath107 ) with @xmath108 given by the inversion of the function eq.([pair1 ] ) , i.e. , from @xmath109 by taking the exterior derivatives of ( @xmath110 one can easily reconstruct the forms ( [ cr1])-([cr2 ] ) .",
    "\\{see newman and nurowski@xcite for details . }    strictly speaking , for the complex equation , @xmath111 to make sense , it should first be defined on @xmath112 and then restricted to @xmath2    recently@xcite it was shown , for all asymptotically flat einstein space - times , that there is a canonical choice of the h - space curve and hence a unique cr structure on @xmath12 the uniqueness arises from certain properties of the weyl tensor . for asymptotically flat einstein - maxwell space - times",
    "there are two canonical choices for the curve and the cr structure .",
    "one choice comes from the weyl tensor s properties , the other from those of the maxwell tensor .",
    "these unique curves appear to have a considerable physical meaning@xcite but a discussion here would be too far afield .",

    "the work described here can be considered as generalizing to arbitrary asymptotically flat einstein or einstein - maxwell space - times the work done by many authors@xcite on structures that exist on or are associated with _",
    "special space - times _ , specifically , minkowski space and the algebraically special space - times .",
    "these structures , which included twistor and projective twistor spaces with several of their three and five dimensional real subspaces which come with cr structures , show the rich mathematical structures contained in large families of solutions to the einstein equations .",
    "it also underlines the deep connection that shear - free and asymptotically shear - free null geodesic congruences play in these structures and in the very basic structure of the einstein equations .",
    "though it is not at all clear what are the physical meanings and consequences of the existence of these structures , there have been strong suggestions of possible physical significance@xcite that must be further explored .",
