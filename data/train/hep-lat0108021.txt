    "in this paper we calculate the critical value of the hopping parameter @xmath0 in lattice qcd , to two loops in perturbation theory .",
    "we employ the @xmath1 improved sheikholeslami - wohlert  @xcite ( clover ) action for wilson fermions ; this action is widely used nowadays in monte carlo simulations , as a means of reducing finite lattice spacing effects , leading to a faster approach to the continuum .",
    "the wilson fermionic action is a standard implementation of fermions on the lattice .",
    "it circumvents the notorious doubling problem by means of a higher derivative term , which removes unphysical propagator poles and has a vanishing classical continuum limit ; at the same time , the action is strictly local , which is very advantageous for numerical simulation .",
    "the price one pays for strict locality and absence of doublers is , of course , well known : the higher derivative term breaks chiral invariance explicitly .",
    "thus , merely setting the bare fermionic mass to zero is not sufficient to ensure chiral symmetry in the quantum continuum limit ; quantum corrections introduce an additive renormalization to the fermionic mass , which must then be fine tuned to have a vanishing renormalized value .",
    "consequently , the hopping parameter @xmath5 , which is very simply related to the fermion mass , must be appropriately shifted from its naive value , in order to recover chiral invariance .    by dimensional power counting",
    ", the additive mass renormalization is seen to be linearly divergent with the lattice spacing .",
    "this adverse feature of wilson fermions , typical of vacuum expectation values of local objects , poses an additional problem to a perturbative treatment , aside from the usual issues related to lack of borel summability .",
    "indeed , our calculation serves as a check on the limits of applicability of perturbation theory , by comparison with non perturbative results coming from monte carlo simulations .    in the present work we will follow the procedure and notation of ref .",

    "the critical fermionic mass and hopping parameter will now depend not only on the number of colors @xmath2 and of fermionic flavours @xmath3 , but also on the free parameter @xmath4 which appears in the clover action ( see next section ) ; we will keep this dependence explicit in our results .    in sec .",

    "they vanish in the classical continuum limit ; at the quantum level , they induce nonvanishing , flavor - independent corrections to the fermion masses . numerical simulation algorithms usually employ the hopping parameter , @xmath30 as an adjustable quantity .",
    "its critical value , at which chiral symmetry is restored , is thus @xmath31 classically , but gets shifted by quantum effects .",
    "the renormalized mass can be calculated in textbook fashion from the fermion self  energy .",

    "fortunately , this part ( we shall denote it by @xmath84 ) is easy to identify , as it necessarily includes all of the @xmath85 part in diagrams 7 , 14 , and the @xmath85 part of diagram 4 involving a clover 5-point vertex .",
