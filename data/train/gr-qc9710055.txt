    "in a recent paper @xcite , we derived a general form of the quantum inequality ( qi ) for quantized scalar fields in static curved spacetimes .",
    "the quantum inequalities are uncertainty type relations which constrain the magnitude and duration of negative energy that may be present in a spacetime .",
    "this was an extension of the previous work carried out by ford and roman which dealt with the quantum inequalities for scalar fields in two- and four - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "in curved spacetimes , it was found that the quantum inequality could be written in terms of a sum of mode functions for the scalar field . with the general form of the quantum inequality in hand ,",
    "we then proceeded to look at the static cases of the three - dimensional closed universe and the four - dimensional robertson - walker spacetimes .",
    "exact functional forms for the quantum inequalities were developed in these spacetimes .",
    "it was found that the curved space quantum inequalities could be written as the flat space quantum inequalities multiplied by a `` scale '' function which detailed the behavior of the inequalities at various ratios of the sampling time to the radius of curvature of the spacetime . in the long sampling time limit ,",
    "the quantum inequality was substantially modified by the scale function . however , in the short sampling time limit , the scale functions tend to 1 , yielding the flat space quantum inequality . this behavior had first been predicted to exist by ford and roman in a paper dealing with negative energy around wormholes . it was argued that by making the sampling time of the quantum inequality much shorter than a minimum characteristic curvature scale , then the spacetime could be considered locally flat and the minkowski space quantum inequality should hold .",
    "this method has since been applied to the alcubierre `` warp drive '' metric @xcite to show that the negative energy that makes up the walls of the warp bubble has to be constrained to exceptionally thin walls , usually on the order of hundreds , or perhaps thousands of planck lengths at most .",
    "similar results were found for the krasnikov metric , where the negative energy that is needed must also be confined to exceptionally thin walls .    in our earlier work @xcite ,",
    "the quantum inequality was derived for stationary observers in static spactimes where the magnitude of the @xmath0 component of the metric was 1 . in this paper",
    "we will extend the derivation of the quantum inequalities to the entire class of static spacetime metrics of the form @xmath1 in sec .",
    "[ sec : qi ] we will derive the general form of the quantum inequality for static observers in such spacetimes , and show that it may be written in terms of a euclidean green s ( two - point ) function .",
    "we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : qawec ] that in the infinite sampling time limit the quantum inequality reduces to the `` quantum averaged weak energy condition '' ( qawec ) which can be written in the form @xmath2 the quantum averaged weak energy condition says that along the entire world - line of a static observer , the sampled energy density can never be more negative than the vacuum energy , @xmath3 . here",
    "the vacuum energy is obtained using the timelike killing vector to define positive frequency .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : expans ] we will perform a short time expansion of the two - point function .",
    "it is found that the leading term of the expansion of the curved space quantum inequality is indeed of the flat space form .",
    "in addition , the first two corrections to the leading order term will be explored .",
    "we will show that they depend only on the geometric properties of the spacetime such as the metric , scalar curvature , etc .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : planar ] we will look at the exact form of the quantum inequality developed for a half infinite flat spacetime .",
    "we will see that the presence of a perfectly reflecting , infinite planar mirror modifies the flat space quantum inequality .",
    "in addition we will look at the case of the quantum inequality between two parallel mirrors .",
    "both of these cases will be developed by first determining the feynman green s function by the method of images , and then using the formalism developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : qi ] to find the respective quantum inequalities .",
    "finally , we will look at the quantum inequalities in spacetimes in which there exist horizons .",
    "we will begin with the two - dimensional rindler coordinates and then move on to the static coordinate representation of de  sitter spacetime . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : black_holes ] we will look at the case of two- and four - dimensional black holes . in two - dimensions , we will find the exact form of the quantum inequality for static observers sitting at fixed radii outside of the black hole . in the case of the four dimensional black hole , because there is no known analytic solution for the mode functions of the scalar field , we find the quantum inequality in the limits @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the limit of long sampling time , the qawec is recovered for these spacetimes .",
    "because this derivation closely resembles that developed earlier @xcite , we will only highlight the necessary steps to replicate the proof for the metric in eq .",

    "on such a fixed background , the wave equation @xmath6 becomes @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the covariant derivative in the spacelike hypersurfaces orthogonal to the killing vector , and @xmath10 is the mass of the field .",

    "the positive frequency mode function solutions can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the solution to the helmholtz equation @xmath14 the label @xmath15 represents the set of quantum numbers necessary to specify the mode .",
    "additionally , the mode functions are defined to have unit klein - gordon norm . a general solution of the scalar field @xmath16",
    "can then be expanded in terms of creation and annihilation operators as @xmath17 where quantization is carried out over a finite box or universe .",
    "if the spacetime has infinite spatial extent , then we replace the summation by an integral over all of the possible modes .    in the development of the quantum inequality",
    ", we will concern ourselves only with static observers , whose four - velocity , @xmath18 , is parallel to the direction of the timelike killing vector .",
    "these are geodesic observers in the case that @xmath0 is a constant , but otherwise are non - geodesic . the energy density ( for minimal coupling ) that such an observer measures is given by @xmath19\\ , .",

    "( [ eq : rho ] ) , one finds that there exists a vacuum energy term which is divergent upon summation .",
    "a regularization and renormalization scheme is needed to define the physical energy density .",
    "this may be side - stepped by concentrating attention upon the difference between the energy density in an arbitrary state and that in the vacuum state , as was done in ref .  .",
    "we will therefore concern ourselves primarily with the normal ordered quantity @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the fock vacuum state defined by the global timelike killing vector . in cases where the renormalized value of @xmath22 is known",
    ", we can convert the difference inequality into an inequality on the renormalized energy density in an arbitrary state .",
    "the energy density as defined above is valid along the entire worldline of the observer .",
    "however , let us sample the energy density only along some finite interval of the geodesic",
    ". this may be accomplished by means of a weighting function which has a characteristic time @xmath23 , such as the lorentzian function , @xmath24 the integral over all time of @xmath25 is equal to one and the width of the lorentzian is characterized by @xmath23 .",

    "the euclidean two - point function is the counterpart of the feynman green s function for the lorentzian metric .",
    "the two are related by @xmath33 this allows us to write the quantum inequality in any static curved spacetime as @xmath34 we see that once we are given a metric which admits a timelike killing vector , we can calculate the limitations on the negative energy densities by either of two methods .",
    "if we know the solutions to the wave equation , then we may construct the inequality from the summation of the mode functions .",
    "more elegantly , if the feynman two - point function is known in the spacetime , then we may immediately calculate the inequality by first euclideanizing and then taking the appropriate derivatives .",
