    "the phenomenon of wave localization has been intensively studied since its prediction in 1958 @xcite , where complete localization was proved in the case of a one - dimensional ( 1-d ) chain defined over a random potential . moreover",
    ", it was shown that the 3-d case allows for an energy - dependent transition from localized to delocalized eigenstates .",
    "the transition has been since coined metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "the critical energy @xmath0 is called a mobility edge ; in general , it depends on and varies upon changes of the control parameters of the given model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , an mit can also be realized in one - dimensional settings with sufficiently correlated disorder potentials @xcite .    in 1980 ,",
    "aubry and andr proved the existence of the mit for a 1-d chain defined over a specific quasiperiodic potential @xcite .",
    "this mit occurs at a critical value ( @xmath1 ) of the onsite potential s strength @xmath2 , and separates the metallic phase @xmath30,2[$ ] from an insulating phase @xmath32,+\\infty[$ ] .",
    "this remarkable result was fully understood via the principle of duality , in which a particular fourier transformation relating eigenmodes and energy spectra allows for a direct functional equivalency between momentum space and its transform counterpart .",
    "this equivalency is energy - independent : upon crossing the critical value @xmath4 all eigenstates turn from localized to extended , regardless of their eigenenergy . the appearance of a mobility edge is thus avoided .",
    "analytic results have been discovered in the last decade regarding the topological cantor structure of the spectrum @xcite and its lebesgue measure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for each different regime ( insulating , metallic and critical ) different spectral decompositions have been found @xcite .",
    "model generalizations were reported , e.g. quasiperiodic systems constantly maintained at criticality @xcite , bichromatic quasiperiodic lattices displaying mobility edges @xcite , and completely localized quasiperiodic models @xcite .",
    "correlated metallic states have also been observed in the insulating regime , for the case of two interacting particles within a 1-d aubry - andr chain @xcite . in another recent work @xcite",
    ", a suitably modified quasiperiodic potential was shown to produce a mobility edge expressable in an analytic form - a property which we will take to new limits using flatband topologies .",
    "wave propagation on lattices with flatband topologies is characterized by the existence of horizontal ( flat ) bands in their band structure .",
    "known in condensed matter , this model class has gained great interest in the scientific community , due in part to experimental realizations in optical lattices and paraxially approximate light propagations @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical discoveries have also considered the presence of a disordered potential @xcite and nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "an innovative procedure detangles flatband states from dispersive ones @xcite .",
    "this allows one to inspect specific features of the models as they relate to the choice of the onsite perturbations , and also suggests specific potential correlations . in the present work , this detangling technique of local rotations @xcite",
    "is applied as an extension of @xcite ; in particular , regarding the preliminary finding of a mit occurring in a flatband lattice under quasiperiodic aubry - andr perturbation .    the present paper has the following structure : in sec.[sec : topos ] the general features of flatband topologies are introduced that define two particular models ( cross - stitch and diamond lattices ) , a quasiperiodic aubry - andr onsite perturbation is defined , and the coordinate transformation that allows rotation into fano defect lattices @xcite . in sec.[sec : cross]-[sec : diamond ] , our findings for the cross - stitch and diamond lattices are respectively presented : for both , two distinct chain correlations are discussed .",
