    "spectra with at least 2000 counts were extracted in circular annuli centered on the x - ray centroid of the cluster .",
    "response files were made using the ciao tools _ mkrmf _ and _ mkwarf_. we attempted to correct the resulting arfs for the quantum efficiency degradation problem using the _ corrarf _ tool .",

    "this scenario is favored in the computational modeling of @xcite , in which the bubble is produced by a high - momentum jet from the agn instead of rising buoyantly .",
    "second , the age was calculated as the time required for the cavity to rise buoyantly ( bubble - like ) at its terminal velocity @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the volume of the bubble , @xmath134 is the cross section of the bubble , and @xmath135 is the drag coefficient @xcite .",
    "the gravitational acceleration was calculated using the stellar velocity dispersion of the central galaxy , under the approximation that the galaxy is an isothermal sphere , as @xmath136 @xcite . published values of the velocity dispersion were used when available ( see table  [ tbl - cluster - radio ] ) ; otherwise , the average value ( @xmath137 ) was adopted .",
    "the cavity age is then given by @xmath138 finally , the age was calculated as the time required to refill the displaced volume as the bubble rises upward @xcite : @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the radius of the cavity [ for ellipsoidal cavities , @xmath141 .    in general",
    ", the ages calculated using the speed of sound are the shortest , those based on the refilling time scale are the greatest , and those calculated using the terminal velocity lie in between .",
    "the instantaneous mechanical luminosity per cavity or cavity pair is then @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the age of the bubble .",
    "this approximation to the mechanical luminosity of the rising bubbles is highly uncertain . in calculating @xmath144 , a measurement of the average timescale for the radio source to replenish itself",
    "is required .",
    "this timescale is unknown for each source , but perhaps this can best be measured in objects with clearly defined ghost cavities and a detached central source , where the duty cycle is clearly evident .",
    "this situation has been noted in two objects , perseus @xcite and a2597 @xcite whose ghost cavities range in age between @xmath145 , with a likely age of @xmath146 when projection is taken into account . furthermore , of the 80 or so clusters we searched for cavities , 16 were found to have them .",
    "if one assumes , for the moment , that all central cluster galaxies produce bubbles at a similar rate , then we are seeing clusters in an on state only @xmath147 of the time .",
    "therefore , the average time elapsed between the production of bubble pairs could be as large as @xmath148 yr , at least in some clusters .",
    "our search did not discriminate between cooling and noncooling clusters , and it is likely , although it has not been proved , that bubbles are produced preferentially in cooling flows .",
    "if true , our estimate of @xmath146 between outbursts is probably closer to the truth for most cooling flow clusters .",
    "then the time averaged mechanical luminosity discussed below has been overestimated in most objects by factors of @xmath149 . on the other hand ,",
    "the 333 mhz radio map of hydra  a @xcite shows 2 plumes extending several times further from the agn than the x - ray cavities ( and the 4  ghz radio image ) .",
    "it also shows an outer radio lobe 4 north of the agn that coincides with a feature in the x - ray image that hints of a distant cavity .",
    "interpreted as above , the outer feature would give a very long interval ( @xmath150  yr ) between bubbles , but the plume indicates that such an outer bubble has been followed ( perhaps some time later ) by an extended period of continuous radio activity . in that case the cavities may just be the latest in a series , but we are failing to detect most of the remnants . this would make our estimate of @xmath151 closer to the truth .",
    "in figure  [ fig - lr_lm ] , we present two plots showing the mechanical luminosity versus the total radio luminosity ( _ left _ ) and the total radio luminosity versus the ratio of the mechanical luminosity to the monochromatic , 1.4  ghz radio luminosity ( _ right _ ) . in each plot",
    "we distinguish between radio - filled and ghost cavities , shown with filled symbols and empty symbols respectively .",
    "the `` error bars '' for each point reflect the range of instantaneous mechanical luminosity implied by the range in possible ages .",
    "the data are taken or are derived from tables  [ tbl - cluster - radio ] and [ tbl - bubbles ] .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig - lr_lm ] shows a trend between the radio luminosity and mechanical luminosity , with the sense that more luminous radio sources tend toward larger mechanical luminosities .",
    "this trend seems to be shared by both the radio - filled cavities and the ghost cavities , in spite of the use of the current central radio power for both the filled cavities and the ghosts , to which the current central source may be unrelated .",
    "no segregation by fom is seen .",
    "the relation between the two luminosities appears to be roughly a power law . to quantify this relation , we used a linear least - squares fit to the logarithms of the data , with errors in mechanical luminosity given by the extreme values for each system .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig - lr_lm ] the best - fit line for the entire sample ( _ dashed line _ ) , given by @xmath152 and for the radio - filled cavities only ( _ dotted line _ ) , given by @xmath153 in both cases , the mechanical luminosity scales as the radio luminosity to approximately the one - half power over six decades of radio power , albeit with large scatter .",
    "the relative contribution of cosmic scatter and observational uncertainty is hard to judge without precision radio data at a variety of wavelengths and without a better understanding of the bubble production timescale .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of this trend demonstrates quantitatively that the radio sources are indeed creating the cavities .",
    "the radio sources are not simply filling preexisting voids in the intracluster medium ( icm ) created by other processes .",
    "furthermore , the synchrotron luminosity and mechanical luminosity do not scale in direct proportion to each other .",
    "this relationship implies that the synchrotron luminosity can not be used to infer the mechanical power of a radio jet in a simple fashion .",
    "an important and poorly understood aspect of radio source physics is the degree of coupling between the mechanical ( kinetic ) luminosity of radio sources and their synchrotron luminosity .",
    "this coupling is theoretically tied to the magnetic field strength and age of the source ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , neither of which can be measured reliably from radio data alone .",
    "radio sources are inefficient radiators .",
    "the ratio of mechanical power to radio power is typically assumed to range between 10 and 100 , almost entirely on theoretical considerations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "measurements of the the x - ray cavity sizes and surrounding gas pressures provide unique estimates of their ages and mechanical luminosities , independently of the radio properties themselves .",
    "we evaluate the ratio of mechanical energy to radio power by plotting the ratio of mechanical power in the bubbles to monochromatic , 1.4  ghz synchrotron luminosity , assuming @xmath154 of energy per radio lobe , against the radio luminosity in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig - lr_lm ] .",
    "this ratio ranges from a few to a few hundred for the powerful sources , which is broadly consistent with theoretical estimates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , abell  478 has a ratio exceeding a few thousand .",
    "to the extent that x - ray cavities provide a good measure of the mechanical energy of radio sources , the large variation in this ratio indicates that radio luminosity is not necessarily a reliable probe of the available mechanical energy .",
    "there are several factors that can introduce scatter into our estimate of the ratio of radio to kinetic power .",
    "the most important is probably intrinsic differences between the radio sources themselves , a consequence of dramatic changes in radio luminosity with time .",
    "certainly , if radio outbursts are to compensate for radiative losses in cooling flows , then the absence of radio emission from some systems requires large variations of radio luminosity with time . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath155 energy of the bubbles alone would tend to underestimate the the mechanical luminosity of radio sources by factors of several if energy dissipating shocks are generated , or if the bubbles expand non - adiabiatically ( they leak ) , or if the internal energy of the bubbles is boosted with a relativistic plasma .",
    "@xcite noted the conversion of enthalpy of the rising bubble into other forms of energy in the cluster atmosphere .",
    "here it is shown that , for an adiabatic bubble , this energy is dissipated in its wake .",
    "if the mass in the bubble is negligible compared to the mass of the gas it displaces , then a bubble rises , because the gas falls in around it to fill the space it occupied .",
    "this process is driven by the potential energy released as the surrounding gas moves inward .",
    "the energy is first converted to gas kinetic energy , then dissipated in the wake of the rising bubble . in the notation of ",
    "[ sec - cavage ] , the potential energy released when the bubble rises a small distance , @xmath156 , is @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the gas density , and we have used the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to replace @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the gas pressure .",
    "this gives a differential equation for the energy dissipated in the bubble wake @xmath161 if the bubble is adiabatic , with ratio of specific heats @xmath162 , then @xmath163 constant and this equation can be integrated to give the energy dissipated as the bubble rises over a large distance , from @xmath164 to @xmath165 , @xmath166 here , subscripts 0 and 1 label quantities at the corresponding radii , and the enthalpy of the bubble is @xmath167 .",
    "note that the bubble is assumed to be small compared to @xmath131 ( otherwise there can be a significant change in the density of the gas as it falls in around the bubble )",
    ". this would rarely be significant in a cluster , but when it is , then some of the potential energy goes into readjustment of the atmosphere as the bubble moves .    for a relativistic gas , @xmath168 , so that the enthalpy is @xmath169 .",
    "the region where this is dissipated by an adiabatic bubble is determined by the pressure distribution of the atmosphere . for clusters such as hydra",
    "a and perseus , roughly half of this energy would be dissipated inside the cooling radius .",
    "it is likely that the bubbles are not entirely adiabatic . on the basis of our numbers , radio losses are generally negligible , but pieces may be broken away from bubbles , and the relativistic particles may leak .",
    "such effects will generally lead to a greater proportion of the bubble energy being deposited within the cooling radius .",
    "it is important to note that our estimate of the mechanical luminosity relies critically on the assumption that the bubbles are close to local pressure equilibrium .",
    "this is at least approximately true for the hydra  a cluster @xcite .",
    "however , according to the standard view of radio sources , bubbles may have been significantly overpressured while being formed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that case",
    ", the expanding bubble drives a shock , and the energy deposited by the expansion can be substantially larger than @xmath155",
    ".    there may be additional heat input from the agns associated with radio outbursts .",
    "this could take the form of spherical shocks ( driven by poorly collimated outflows ) , direct injection of relativistic particles , inverse compton heating @xcite , or other processes .",
    "very substantial additional heat inputs would drive convection , leading to an isentropic core and mixing out of abundance gradients @xcite , but this is not a very strong constraint .",
    "if such energy injection is significantly more than the bubble energy input , then it is inappropriate to associate it directly with the bubbles , but the mean heating power may be correlated with bubble mechanical power .    finally , it should be noted that even for adiabatic bubbles , the free energy of a bubble decreases with time , and bubbles may even break up quickly , so that they disappear as x - ray cavities .",
    "this means that the instantaneous estimate of bubble mechanical power that we have used varies with time , and may vary dramatically .",
    "a much better controlled sample is needed to investigate such issues .",
    "we now turn to the question of whether radio sources deposit enough energy into the icm to quench cooling .",
    "we use @xmath43 , the total luminosity of the x - ray  emitting gas from within the cooling radius , as an estimate of the classical , or morphological , cooling luminosity in the absence of heating and @xmath44 , the spectral estimate of the cooling luminosity within the cooling radius , as the luminosity of the gas cooling to low temperatures .",
    "the cooling luminosity , @xmath170 , must be offset by heating in order to prevent the gas from cooling to low temperatures .",
    "we note that this quantity ignores non  x - ray cooling , such as ultraviolet and optical emission , predicted to result from cooling by thermal conduction inside magnetic flux loops @xcite , or along reconnected magnetic field lines between cold clouds and the icm @xcite .",
    "any such emission would lower the cooling luminosity which must be balanced by heating .",
    "figure  [ fig - lx_lm ] shows the mechanical luminosity plotted against @xmath170 for our sample .",
    "the diagonal lines represent equality between cooling and heating , assuming energy inputs of @xmath171 @xmath172 and @xmath173 per cavity .",
    "the data are derived from tables  [ tbl - cluster - xray ] and [ tbl - bubbles ] .",
    "for rbs  797 , an upper limit is shown .",
    "the cooling luminosity for rbs  797 is poorly constrained by the spectrum , which consists of only @xmath174 counts after cleanin .",
    "rbs  797 , while very luminous , is the most distant cluster in our sample and has the shortest exposure time ( see section  [ sec - sample ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - lx_lm ] shows several objects , such as hydra  a , cygnus  a , and m84 , whose cavities can contain enough energy to balance radiative losses , at least temporarily , with nearly @xmath154 of heat input per cavity .",
    "the remaining objects , which require between a few and @xmath175 per cavity to balance cooling , would do so with varying degrees of difficulty . as discussed above ,",
    "@xmath176 would be deposited within the cooling radius by an adiabatic bubble containing relativistic plasma . up to @xmath177",
    "is available if the cavities are relativistic and nonadiabatic , and there may be further energy input if they are overpressured or produce a shock when they are formed .",
    "therefore , the objects that require @xmath178 or less may reasonably be supplied with enough energy in the cavities to balance cooling , depending on the detailed dynamics ( the heat also needs to be distributed inside the cooling radius to match the distribution of radiative losses ) .",
    "provided that the true radio cycling timescale ranges between @xmath179 and @xmath180 , the cavities in one quarter to one - half of the objects in our sample contain enough energy to offset radiation losses .",
    "this would be true of the cavities in the remaining objects only if they are significantly nonadiabatic , as outlined in ",
    "[ sec - quenching ] .",
    "bear in mind that our conclusions depend on the adopted cooling radius ( see  3.2 ) , measurement uncertainties in the cavity sizes , and the cavity production timescale .",
    "nevertheless , we can safely conclude that cooling can plausibly be balanced by bubble heating in some , but not all , systems .",
    "it is unnecessary to balance the entire luminosity , @xmath181 by bubble heating alone if there are other forms of heating present .",
    "a possible source of heating is thermal conduction , which , as demonstrated by @xcite , could supply a significant amount of heat . using a sample similar to our own , voigt & fabian found that thermal conduction can reduce the cooling luminosity by factors of @xmath182 in some objects .",
    "although they are difficult to find in x - ray images , shocks associated with the expanding cavities can deposit additional energy into the icm .",
    "chandra _ images of a growing number of objects , including cygnus  a @xcite , ngc 4636 @xcite , m87 @xcite , and perseus @xcite , show surface brightness discontinuities that may be associated with weak shocks . in cygnus",
    "a and m87 , the shocks imply that the radio source may provide several times the upper limit of the luminosity seen in the bubbles , under the assumption of @xmath169 of energy per bubble @xcite .",
    "it may therefore be a combination of heating mechanisms that leads to quenched cooling , as suggested by several authors @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that that our sample is biased toward systems with visible evidence for x - ray cavities , and does not represent clusters as a whole .",
    "many clusters , including some with large cooling flows , do not contain cavities ( e.g.  abell 1068 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these objects may have very different reheating histories than the objects discussed here . in this sense , the objects presented here represent the best - case examples for reheating the icm by energetic bubbles .",
    "our analysis does not imply that all cooling flows can be quenched in this fashion .",
    "figure  [ fig - lx_lm ] shows a trend between the x - ray luminosity and bubble mechanical luminosity , with the sense that systems with larger x - ray luminosities also have larger mechanical luminosities .",
    "this trend extends over a dynamic range of @xmath183 in both x - ray and mechanical luminosity .",
    "just such a trend would be expected were the cooling and heating of the icm coupled in some fashion .",
    "several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have proposed that cooling is balanced by heating in a self - regulated feedback loop .",
    "the feedback loop is driven by episodic radio activity fueled by cooling and accretion onto a central black hole .",
    "the accretion energy is then returned to the icm through an agn outburst , including the action of the radio cavities , which temporarily arrests cooling . at later times ,",
    "the center of the system settles down and the cooling flow is reestablished . during the cooling cycle , molecular gas @xcite accumulates and star formation ensues @xcite , albeit at substantially lower levels than expected in steady - cooling models @xcite .",
    "even if the radio bubbles are not the main source of heat , figure  [ fig - lx_lm ] suggests that agn feedback is intimately involved in the process that prevents a large cooling flow from forming .    the apparent correlation in figure  [ fig - lx_lm ]",
    "should be treated with caution .",
    "as noted earlier , our sample was selected from clusters in the _ chandra _ archive with fairly obvious cavities in their cores , and neglects those without obvious cavities .",
    "other clusters are known to have substantial cooling luminosities commensurate with the observed levels of cold gas and star formation , yet contain no cavities and have low radio power .",
    "a prime example is a1068 @xcite .",
    "similar objects would appear in the lower right of this diagram , tending to weaken the correlation .",
    "on the other hand , it is unlikely that we would have missed objects with powerful cavities , which would lie in the upper part of this diagram .",
    "therefore , the distribution of points may represent an upper envelope in mechanical luminosity as a function of x - ray luminosity .",
    "such a distribution would be consistent with the feedback hypothesis , if objects like a1068 are in an extended cooling phase in which the central galaxies have experienced substantial levels of accretion in the past 100  myr or so , when the radio source has not had a chance to create cavities capable of reducing or quenching cooling .",
    "we have investigated the degree to which other systematic effects may lead to an unphysical luminosity - luminosity correlation .",
    "for example , @xcite pointed out that a sample of objects with a small range of fluxes and a large range of distances will show a correlation in a luminosity - versus - luminosity plot , even if there is no intrinsic correlation in the sample . our sample , however , has a large range of radio fluxes ( from @xmath184  mjy to @xmath185  mjy ) .",
    "the cavities in our sample also cover a large range of projected angular sizes ( from @xmath186 `` to @xmath187 '' ) .",
    "we believe , then , that these potential effects are unlikely to account entirely for the trends seen in figures  [ fig - lr_lm ] and [ fig - lx_lm ] .",
    "selection bias may also contribute to the correlations .",
    "small cavities are easily overlooked in distant objects , since cavities of a given linear size become more difficult to detect as their angular sizes decrease with increasing distance .",
    "conversely , in very nearby objects , such as m87 , we may miss larger bubbles that lie outside the detector .",
    "furthermore , other considerations , such as the bubble position , affect the detectability @xcite .",
    "the consequences of these and other effects on our selection function will be addressed in the future using a larger and better - defined sample of clusters , including a more sophisticated approach to placing limits on cavities that may exist in clusters but were missed by the observations .",
    "we have presented an analysis of 18 systems taken from the _ chandra _ archive having clear evidence for cavities in their x - ray emission .",
    "we find that the energy associated with the cavities is sufficient to substantially reduce or quench cooling in nearly half of the objects in our sample .",
    "however , this mechanism alone probably does not provide a general solution to the cooling problem , unless x - ray cavities probe only a small fraction of the total kinetic luminosity of radio sources .",
    "in addition , we have discovered a trend between the cooling x - ray luminosity and the mechanical energy of the cavities , with the sense that more luminous systems produce larger and more energetic cavities .",
    "the trend , or envelope , may have been established by a self - regulated cooling and feedback mechanism acting in many systems .",
    "the existence of such a mechanism in relatively nearby clusters , where the detailed physics can be examined , may provide significant insight on the process of galaxy formation that prevails at large redshifts ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "a similar mechanism may regulate the growth of galaxy halos during the dissipative stages of their development @xcite and may be an agent responsible for the detailed correlation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion of spheroids @xcite .",
    "we have measured for the first time the distribution of the ratio of kinetic luminosity to monochromatic radio luminosity for a sample of radio sources .",
    "the ratio varies widely , with most objects ranging between few and a few hundred , assuming @xmath154 of energy per cavity .",
    "x - ray cavities provide a unique probe of the mechanical power of radio jets , independently of the radio properties themselves .",
    "our future plans include expanding the sample size and acquiring better and more uniform radio data .",
    "in addition , we plan to extend our understanding of the detectability function of bubbles , using simulations of images with a wide range of exposure and signal - to - noise ratios .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of sixteen galaxy clusters , one group and one galaxy drawn from the _ chandra _ x - ray data archive . </S>",
    "<S> these systems possess prominent x - ray surface brightness depressions associated with cavities or bubbles that were created by interactions between powerful radio sources and the surrounding hot gas . </S>",
    "<S> the central galaxies in these systems harbor radio sources with luminosities ranging between @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the cavities have an average radius of @xmath1 , and they lie at an average projected distance of @xmath2 from the central galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum energy associated with the cavities ranges from @xmath3 in galaxies , groups , and poor clusters to @xmath4 in rich clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the hypothesis that cooling in the hot gas can be quenched by energy injected into the surrounding gas by the rising bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the instantaneous mechanical luminosities required to offset cooling range between @xmath5 and @xmath6 per cavity . </S>",
    "<S> nearly half of the systems in this study may have instantaneous mechanical luminosities large enough to balance cooling , at least for a short period of time , if the cavities are filled with a relativistic gas . </S>",
    "<S> we find a trend or upper envelope in the distribution of central x - ray luminosity versus instantaneous mechanical luminosity with the sense that the most powerful cavities are found in the most x - ray  luminous systems . </S>",
    "<S> such a trend would be expected if many of these systems produce bubbles at a rate that scales in proportion to the cooling rate of the surrounding gas . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the x - ray cavities to measure the mechanical power of radio sources over six decades of radio luminosity , independently of the radio properties themselves . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ratio of the instantaneous mechanical ( kinetic ) luminosity to the 1.4  ghz synchrotron luminosity ranges from a few to roughly a thousand . </S>",
    "<S> this wide range implies that the 1.4 ghz synchrotron luminosity is an unreliable gauge of the mechanical power of radio sources . </S>"
