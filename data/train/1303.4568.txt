    "a wave length of a particle of a momentum @xmath0 is given by planck constant @xmath1 as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and is of microscopic size .",
    "the momentum eigenstate is a plane wave of uniform density and many free waves of a constant kinetic - energy are also uniform in space and are like free particles . a system of many waves of varying kinetic energy shows non - uniform behavior called diffraction .",
    "a diffraction pattern has a spatial scale of the wave length normally but can become much longer in a system of a space - time symmetry . the diffraction of this kind that depends on space - time position in many - body scatterings is studied .",
    "the diffraction gives corrections to transition probabilities computed by fermi s golden rule .",
    "these corrections are connected with calibrations of detectors and might be known partly to experimentalists .",
    "even so , it is important and useful to many physicists to clarify them .    in diffraction of light , electron , or others ,",
    "a potential energy transforms an in - coming wave to a sum of waves of different kinetic energies .",
    "now , a many - body interaction transforms a many - body state to a sum of the same kinetic energy , and the waves behave like free particles and do not show the diffraction at the asymptotic region , @xmath4 . in non - asymptotic region of a finite @xmath5 , however , the kinetic energy is not constant and takes broad values .",
    "so the state reveals the diffraction .",
    "since this diffraction is caused by a many - body interaction , the pattern has universal properties and appears even in vacuum . the diffraction , furthermore",
    ", gives peculiar corrections to decay rates that depend on the time interval between those of the initial and final states , which we call a finite - size correction .",
    "scattering processes are defined with the initial states prepared at @xmath6 and the final states measured at @xmath7 , where they do not interact with others and have no interaction energy .",
    "the initial and final states have the constant kinetic energy and reveal the particle nature .",
    "amplitudes and probabilities in the asymptotic region have been studied well @xcite .",
    "now near the scattering center , the states overlap and have finite interaction energy .",
    "thus they retain wave natures .",
    "we call the former region a particle zone , the latter region a wave zone , and a length of boundary a coherence length",
    ". fig.([fig : wave - zone ] ) shows them in a two - body scattering . in the particle zone , even at a finite @xmath5 , the states behave like particles . in the wave zone",
    ", however , the state reveals the wave phenomenon that depends on the position and can not be described with only the momentum dependent distribution function @xcite .",
    "[ fig : wave - zone ]    the coherence length has been considered microscopic in size of the order of de broglie wave length , which may be true for most cases .",
    "then the phenomena in the wave zone may be irrelevant to physics and unimportant .",
    "however , there has been no serious investigation on this length .",
    "we study problems connected ed with the wave zone and find that a new length @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are a particle s mass and energy , appears for the coherence length and becomes much longer than de broglie wave length in relativistically invariant systems .",
    "a space - time dependent phase of a relativistic wave packet @xmath11 becomes @xmath12 of the angular velocity , @xmath13 at a position moving with the velocity , @xmath14 , as @xmath15 .",
    "the angular velocity becomes small for a light particle or at high energy and its inverse gives a new scale of length .",
    "the length becomes even macroscopic for an extremely light particle such as neutrino .",
    "then the wave zone has a macroscopic size , and physical phenomena unique to the quantum mechanical waves occur in the macroscopic region .",
    "they are natural consequences of schrdinger equations .",
    "the physics in this region has not been studied except for neutrino and is the subject of the present work .",
    "ordinarily , scattering amplitude is defined in the particle zone and is rigorously formulated with wave packets @xcite , and in practical situations , they are approximated well with plane waves . for scattering processes at a finite - time interval , t , in the wave zone , probabilities to detect them vary with t and deviates from that of the infinite - time interval .",
    "we call the deviation a finite - size correction and we study them in various processes involving light particles in this paper .",
    "the finite - size corrections of the scattering amplitude and probability have been considered irrelevant to experiments in high - energy regions .",
    "plane waves with a damping factor @xmath16 with a positive and infinitesimal @xmath17 in an interaction hamiltonian employed often for practical calculations are invariant under translations and are extended in space .",
    "this method is powerful for computing the asymptotic values but does not supply the finite - size corrections . because the amplitude in the wave zone is sensitive to the boundary conditions of the initial and final state , that has a dependence on the distance between them .",
    "hence , the probability has a finite - size correction which has an origin in the boundary conditions .",
    "the correction must be included for making a comparison of a theory with an experiment then .",
    "an amplitude constructed with wave packets implements manifestly the boundary conditions and supplies the finite - size correction .",
    "previous studies of decay processes at finite - time intervals in the particle zone using an interaction hamiltonian of the damping factor @xmath16 @xcite showed that time dependences of decay law of unstable particles are modified from simple exponential behaviors due to higher - order effects .",
    "these analysis and others of computing the decay rates are applicable to kinematical regions where the wave functions of the parent and daughters do not overlap .",
    "as was pointed out in ref.@xcite correctly , the standard method can not be applied in kinematical regions where they overlap .",
    "the states have the wave natures , and the decay rate and other physical quantities in this region have been thought neither meaningful nor computable since then .",
    "this is the region , in fact , where the probability to detect the decay product has a large finite - size correction .",
    "it is a main subject of the present work to develop a theory of s - matrix that satisfies the boundary conditions of the measuring processes and to find formulas of the physical quantities in this region .",
    "one of our results for decay rate @xmath18 at the large distance @xmath19 is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the asymptotic value , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the mean - life time , wave packet size , energy , and mass of the detected particle , and the mass of daughter and parent , respectively .",
    "@xmath26 is a numerical constant and @xmath27 is the form factor .",
    "the second term in the right - hand side of eq.@xmath28 is inversely proportional to @xmath29 and vanishes at @xmath30 .",
    "so this is the finite - size correction . from its form ,",
    "the correction becomes significant in small @xmath9 , large @xmath23 and @xmath10 , and become macroscopic in their sizes for light particles such as photon or neutrino .",
    "this shows @xmath31 in eq.@xmath32 , the rate becomes the asymptotic value , whereas in eq.@xmath33 , the rate diverges .",
    "the energy distribution reveals also unusual properties even at @xmath30 , if particles of large and small sizes are involved in one process .",
    "they should appear in various situations such as an interface of two phases , and interesting physics is expected .",
    "implications on particle decays are studied .",
    "the transition probability @xmath34 composed of many processes in the particle zone are factorized to that of each microscopic process , @xmath35 , as @xmath36 now , the probability for transition processes in the wave zone is not factorized due to the finite - size corrections , but the whole process is described by the product of wave functions of each microscopic process @xmath37 because the probability of the whole processes is not factorized , markov nature of the multiple processes is lost .",
    "the non - markov nature is related with a epr correlation @xcite and may give various implications .",
    "the decay rates are studied in the present paper and the scattering cross sections are studied in a subsequent paper .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner . in section 2 , a wave function and s - matrix at a finite - time interval",
    "are shown to be different from those of the infinite - time interval .",
    "particles described by wave packets and their interactions caused by a local hamiltonian are summarized in section 3 .",
    "two - body decays are studied in section 4 , and radiative decays of atoms , nuclears , and particles are studied in section 5 . in section 6",
