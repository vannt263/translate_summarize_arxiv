    "this is the latest in a series of papers in which we compare theoretical emission - line intensity ratios , generated using accurate atomic physics data for energy levels , radiative rates , and electron impact excitation cross sections , with high resolution spectra from the solar extreme - ultraviolet research telescope and spectrograph ( serts ) .",
    "the major aim of our work is to investigate the importance of blending in the solar extreme - ultraviolet spectral regions covered by serts ( 170225 ; 235450 ) , and hence determine which emission lines provide the most reliable diagnostics , and also where possible to identify new emission features . to date , we have studied the serts spectra of civ ( keenan et al .",

    "2005a ) , fexii ( keenan et al .",
    "1996 ) and fexv ( keenan et al .",
    "2005b ) .",
    "our work is currently of particular relevance due to the recent launch of the _ hinode _ mission .",
    "this has on board the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) , which obtains high spectral resolution observations over wavelength ranges similar to those covered by serts , specifically 170210  and 250290  ( culhane et al .",
    "2005 ) . clearly , it is important that the emission lines observed by the eis are investigated in detail and the best diagnostics identified , with serts providing the ideal testbed for this . in the present paper we undertake a study of fexiii , which as noted by young , landi & thomas ( 1998 ) is the species with the most emission lines detected in the serts spectral range .",
    "it has also long been known that fexiii emission lines provide very useful electron density diagnostics for solar plasmas ( flower & nussbaumer 1974 ) .",
    "the most detailed investigation to date of the fexiii solar extreme - ultraviolet spectrum , which also employs serts observations , is probably that by landi ( 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , his paper contains an excellent review of previous work on fexiii .",
    "landi undertook two separate calculations of theoretical line ratios for fe  xiii , with the most reliable consisting of a 27 fine - structure level model ion , comprising the 3s@xmath03p@xmath0 , 3s3p@xmath1 and 3s@xmath03p3d configurations , with radiative rates being taken from the superstructure calculations of young ( 2004 ) , and electron impact excitation cross sections from the r - matrix results of gupta & tayal ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , landi found that some of the fe  xiii line intensities showed large discrepancies between theory and observation , which could not be explained by blending , and was therefore most likely due to errors in the adopted atomic data ( see also young et al .",
    "1998 and landi & landini 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , aggarwal & keenan ( 2004 , 2005 ) have employed the relativistic grasp and dirac r - matrix codes to calculate radiative rates and electron impact excitation cross sections , respectively , for all transitions among the energetically lowest 97 fine - structure levels of fexiii . in this paper",
    "we use these data to generate theoretical emission - line ratios for fexiii , and compare these with serts observations , to ( i ) investigate if previous discrepancies between theory and observation may be resolved , ( ii ) assess the importance of blending in the serts observations , ( iii ) detect new fexiii emission lines , and finally ( iv ) identify the best fexiii line pairs for use as electron density diagnostics .",
    "the first fully successful serts flight was on 1989 may 5 ( neupert et al . 1992 ; thomas & neupert 1994 ) , and carried a standard gold - coated toroidal diffraction grating .",
    "it observed active region noaa 5464 and detected hundreds of first - order emission lines in the 235450  wavelength range , as well as dozens of features spanning 170225 , which appeared in second - order among the 340450  first - order lines .",
    "the spectrum was recorded on kodak 10107 emulsion , at a spectral resolution of 5080m  ( fwhm ) in first - order , and a spatial resolution of approximately 7 arcsec ( fwhm ) .",
    "serts had additional technology - demonstration flights in 1991 and 1993 ( brosius et al .",
    "1996 ) , carrying a multilayer - coated diffraction grating that enhanced the instrumental sensitivity over a limited range of its first - order bandpass .",
    "however , over much of the range , these observations are actually at a somewhat reduced sensitivity compared to the 1989 data . as a result",
    ", fewer emission lines were detected , and many of those that were measured had larger uncertainities ( see , for example , the comparison of serts 1989 , 1991 and 1993 measurements in keenan et al .",
    "2003a , b and keenan et al .",
    "consequently , the 1989 observations ( henceforth referred to as serts89 ) provide the best serts spectrum for investigating emission features in the first - order wavelength range 235450 , and are hence employed in the present analysis .    during a rocket flight on 1995",
    "may 15 , serts observed active region noaa 7870 , once again recording the spectrum on kodak 10107 emulsion at a spatial resolution of approximately 5 arcsec ( brosius , davila & thomas 1998 ) .",
    "however , this version of the instrument incorporated a multilayer - coated toroidal diffraction grating that enhanced its sensivitity to second - order features in the 170225  wavelength range .",
    "this led to the detection of many second - order emission lines not seen on previous serts flights ( thomas & neupert 1994 ; brosius et al .",
    "1996 ) , and furthermore provided the highest spectral resolution ( 0.03 ) ever achieved for spatially resolved active region spectra in this wavelength range . the serts 1995 active region spectrum ( henceforth serts95 )",
    "therefore provides the best observations for investigating emission lines in the 170225  region , and is employed in the present paper .",
    "further details of the observations , and the wavelength and absolute flux calibration procedures employed in the data reduction , may be found in brosius et al .",
    "similar information for the serts89 spectrum is available from thomas & neupert ( 1994 ) .",
    "we note that the serts spectra have been calibrated using temperature and density insensitive emission line ratios , including those from fexiii . as the relevant line ratio calculations may have changed since these calibrations were performed , and indeed several have ( see , for example , keenan et al .",
    "2005b ) , any comparison of theoretical and observed fexiii line ratios must be treated with some caution . however , even if the calibration were to change , this would be unlikely to significantly affect line pairs which are close in wavelength .",
    "we have searched for fexiii emission lines in the serts89 and serts95 spectra using the identifications of thomas & neupert ( 1994 ) and brosius et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , as well as other sources including the nist database , physics.nist.gov@xmath8physrefdata@xmath8 ] the latest version ( v5.2 ) of the chianti database ( dere et al . 1997 ; landi et al . 2006 ) , and previous solar detections where available ( for example , those of dere 1978 ) . in tables 1 and 2",
    "we list the fexiii transitions found in the serts95 and serts89 spectra , respectively , along with the measured wavelengths .",
    "we also indicate possible blending lines or alternative identifications as suggested by brosius et al . or thomas & neupert in their original line lists for these observations .",
    "note that we list two measured wavelengths for the same 3s@xmath03p@xmath0 @xmath1p@xmath103s@xmath03p3d @xmath1p@xmath11 transition in the serts95 spectrum , namely 202.43 and 203.17 .",
    "brosius et al .",
    "identify fe  xiii lines at 202.42 and 203.16  in the serts95 data , but landi ( 2002 ) only lists the 203.16  emission feature ( as does chianti ) .",
    "we return to the identification of this line in section 4.1 .    [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath12determined from present line ratio calculations at t@xmath4 = 10@xmath13k ; n@xmath4 in @xmath7 .",
    "+ @xmath14factor by which the theoretical line ratio varies between n@xmath4 = 10@xmath5 and 10@xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "+ @xmath15factor by which the theoretical line ratio varies between n@xmath4 = 10@xmath16 and 10@xmath6@xmath7 only ( see fig .",
    "as expected , for the serts95 active region , the most consistent and reliable results in table 9 come from the problem - free lines , with 196.53/202.04 , 200.03/202.04 , 201.13/203.79 and 203.17/202.04 all yielding log @xmath17 = 9.1@xmath180.1 .",
    "our recommendation is that 200.03/202.04 and 203.17/202.04 are preferentially employed as diagnostics , due to the wavelength proximity of the transitions involved and the n@xmath4sensitivity of the ratios .",
    "although 196.53/202.04 is very density sensitive , the transitions involved are further apart and the ratio is hence more susceptible to possible errors in the instrumental intensity calibration .",
    "we note that the average electron density found for the serts95 active region in the present work using the subset of line ratios involving problem - free transitions , log n@xmath4 = 9.1@xmath180.1 , is very similar to that derived by landi ( 2002 ) from the atomic data of gupta & tayal ( 1998 ) using the same set of diagnostics , namely log n@xmath4 = 9.2@xmath180.1 .",
    "unfortunately , many of the density diagnostics in the serts89 wavelength range are not particularly n@xmath4sensitive , as may be seen from table 10 . as a result ,",
    "most of the derived values of n@xmath4 have very large error bars .",
    "however , the best diagnostics in terms of n@xmath4sensitivity , wavelength proximity of line pairs , and avoiding problem lines , are judged to be 348.18/320.80 , 348.18/368.16 , 359.64/348.18 and 359.83/368.16 .",
    "these imply an average of log n@xmath4 = 9.1@xmath180.2 , compared to log n@xmath4 = 9.3@xmath180.2 derived by landi ( 2002 ) from the same set of diagnostics .",
    "our comparison of theoretical fexiii emission - line intensity ratios with high resolution solar active region spectra from serts reveals generally good agreement between theory and experiment , and has led to the identification of several new fexiii emission features at 203.79 , 259.94 , 288.56 and 290.81 .",
    "however , problems with several fexiii transitions , first noted by landi ( 2002 ) and young et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , remain outstanding , and can not be explained by blending .",
    "errors in the adopted atomic data appear to be the most likely explanation , especially for transitions which have 3s@xmath03p3d @xmath2d@xmath3 as their upper level , and further calculations are urgently required .    for the serts95 wavelength region ( 170225 ) , we find that the ratios 200.03/202.04 and 203.17/202.04 provide the best fexiii density diagnostics , as they involve line pairs which appear to be problem - free , are close in wavelength and are highly n@xmath4sensitive .",
    "similarly , for the serts89 range ( 235450 ) we recommend the use of 348.18/320.80 , 348.18/368.16 , 359.64/348.18 and 359.83/368.16 to derive values of n@xmath4 for the fexiii emitting region of the plasma .",
