    "by the @xmath1-dimensional @xmath0 milnor fibre , we mean the complex hypersurface @xmath2 defined by the equation @xmath3 the topology of these manifolds is described by classical singularity theory ( see for instance @xcite or the more recent @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath4 is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of @xmath5 spheres of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the intersection pairing on @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 if @xmath1 is even , respectively @xmath8 if @xmath1 is odd .",
    "now let s turn @xmath4 into a ( real ) symplectic @xmath9-manifold in the standard way , by using the restriction of the constant khler form on @xmath10 .",
    "these manifolds have become a test case for general techniques in symplectic topology .",
    "we will not consider the results that have been obtained specifically for @xmath11 , since those belongs to the context of cotangent bundles , @xmath12 . with that excluded ,",
    "relevant papers are @xcite .",
    "continuing that tradition , we will derive a topological restriction on lagrangian submanifolds :    [ th : primitive ] let @xmath13 , @xmath14 , be a lagrangian submanifold which is a rational homology sphere and _ spin_. then its homology class @xmath15 \\in h_n(q_m^n;{\\mathbb{z } } ) { \\cong}{\\mathbb{z}}^m$ ] is primitive ( nonzero and not a multiple ) .",
    "we also have an intersection statement , like a form of the arnold conjecture but with very weak assumptions :    [ th : arnold ] let @xmath16 be lagrangian submanifolds as in theorem [ th : primitive ] . if @xmath17 = [ l_1]$ ] mod @xmath18 , then necessarily @xmath19 .",
    "this yields an upper bound ( depending on @xmath5 ) for the number of pairwise disjoint lagrangian submanifolds of the relevant type",
    ". note that for even @xmath1 , both statements have elementary proofs .",
    "the first one holds because then , @xmath15 \\cdot [ l ] = ( -1)^{n/2 } \\chi(l ) = ( -1)^{n/2 } 2 $ ] . for the second one , note that is even",
    "hence , if @xmath20 = [ l_0]$ ] mod @xmath18 , then @xmath21 - [ l_0 ] ) \\cdot ( [ l_1 ] - [ l_0 ] ) = ( -1)^{n/2 } 4 - 2 [ l_0 ] \\cdot [ l_1 ] \\text { mod } 8,\\ ] ] which implies that @xmath17 \\cdot [ l_1 ] = 2 $ ] mod @xmath22 .",
    "one can use the definiteness of to analyze the possible homology classes in more detail , but that is not required for our purpose .",
    "more importantly , for @xmath23 and any @xmath14 , theorem [ th : primitive ] is a consequence of the following stronger result of abouzaid - smith ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1.5 ) :    [ th : abouzaid - smith ] any closed lagrangian submanifold @xmath24 , @xmath14 , whose maslov class vanishes is an integral homology sphere , and has primitive homology class .",
    "abouzaid - smith s results are actually even sharper , and also imply the @xmath23 case of theorem [ th : arnold ] .",
    "we should say that our point of view is fundamentally similar to theirs , in that we approach the problem via fukaya categories ( in other respects , our argument is quite different ) .",
    "one useful feature of the fukaya category is that it admits objects which are lagrangian submanifolds equipped with flat complex vector bundles . by applying the same ideas to those , one obtains the following :    [ th : abelian ]",
    "let @xmath13 , @xmath14 , be a lagrangian rational homology sphere which is _",
    "spin_. then there is no homomorphism @xmath25 such that the associated twisted cohomology is acyclic , @xmath26 .",
    "[ th : nonabelian ] let @xmath13 , @xmath14 , be a closed lagrangian submanifold which is _",
    "spin_. then there is no homomorphism @xmath27 , @xmath28 , such that @xmath29    both statements are empty for even @xmath1 , because the conditions imposed ca nt be satisfied for euler characteristic reasons . also , even though we have not stated that explicitly , theorem [ th : nonabelian ] is again only a statement about rational homology spheres , since @xmath30 always contains @xmath31 as a direct summand .",
    "consider the lowest nontrivial dimension @xmath32 .",
    "there , theorems [ th : abelian ] and [ th : nonabelian ] together say that @xmath33 ca nt be a spherical space form , which means @xmath34 for finite @xmath35 acting freely ( the _ spin _ assumption being automatically true in this dimension ) .",
    "namely , if @xmath36 is abelian then @xmath33 would be a lens space , to which theorem [ th : abelian ] applies ; and if @xmath36 is nonabelian , it has an irreducible representation of rank @xmath37 , to which theorem [ th : nonabelian ] applies .    continuing the previous discussion , theorem [ th : nonabelian ]",
    "also rules out all rational homology @xmath38-spheres which are hyperbolic . to see that , recall that the hyperbolic structure on a closed three - manifold @xmath33 gives rise to a map @xmath39 which can be lifted to @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath41 , and the second summand vanishes by weil s infinitesimal precursor of mostow rigidity ( see for instance @xcite for a statement and further references ) .",
    "however , this particular consequence is not new : since the complex three - dimensional @xmath0 milnor fibre admits a dilation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 7.4 ) , it ca nt contain any closed lagrangian submanifold which is a @xmath42 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.3 ) .",
    "we will now explain the overall nature of our argument .",
    "let @xmath43 be the fukaya category .",
    "it is known ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 20 ) , which is largely based on @xcite ) that a certain formal enlargement , the split - closed derived category , which we here denote by @xmath44 , can be explicitly described , as the derived category @xmath45 of perfect dg modules over a certain finite - dimensional algebra @xmath46 .",
    "problems about lagrangian spheres can therefore be approached in a purely algebraic way by looking at spherical objects in @xmath45 . for @xmath47",
    ", those objects have been completely classified by ishii , ueda and uehara @xcite ( for another application of this classification in symplectic topology , see the very recent @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no straightforward relation between the categories @xmath45 for different @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , if one considers the derived categories @xmath48 of _ complexes of graded modules _ over @xmath46 , and appropriate subcategories @xmath49 of perfect objects inside those ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath1 is minimal .",
    "finally , concerning the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath45 , it is an elementary algebraic observation that the first category can be viewed as `` bigraded '' or `` equivariant '' ( for a certain action of @xmath50 ) refinement of the second one .",
    "given that , the missing ingredient is a way of making objects equivariant , and we will now turn to that question in a fairly general context .",
    "as motivation , consider the following situation",
    ". let @xmath51 be a smooth projective variety over @xmath52 , carrying an action of @xmath50 .",
    "we denote by @xmath53 the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves , and by @xmath54 its equivariant analogue ( for consistency with the rest of the paper , we actually want to consider the underlying dg categories , but still use the classical notation ) . in (",
    "* lemma 2.2 ) , it was pointed out that the existence of moduli stacks for a suitable class of objects in @xmath53 @xcite together with a gluing theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2.4 ) implies the following :    [ th : polishchuk ] let @xmath55 be an object of @xmath53 which is rigid and simple , meaning that @xmath56 suppose in addition that @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "then @xmath55 is quasi - isomorphic to an object coming from @xmath54 .    what is surprising , at least at first glance ,",
    "is that there is a single overall condition which then implies , a fortiori , equivariance for all the cohomology sheaves @xmath59 ( if one restricts to sheaves , which means objects of the abelian category rather than its derived category , the result is easier and more classical ; see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ( in the preprint version only ) ) , or the case of bundles on homogeneous spaces mentioned in @xcite ) . as pointed out to the author by ton , the condition on the negative degree endomorphisms in theorem [ th : polishchuk ] can be removed by using the more powerful methods of homotopical algebraic geometry .",
    "this leads to the following result ( unpublished , but follows from techniques in @xcite ) :    [ th : toen ] let @xmath60 be a differential graded algebra over @xmath52 which is proper ( has finite - dimensional cohomology ) and smooth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 8.1.2 ) .",
    "suppose that it carries an action of @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath61 be the derived category of perfect dg modules ( in this case , that is the same as the derived category of dg modules with finite - dimensional cohomology ) .",
    "let @xmath62 be a rigid and simple object of @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath62 is quasi - isomorphic to a @xmath50-equivariant dg module .    to be precise , by an action of @xmath50 we meant a linear action which is rational ( a direct sum of finite - dimensional representations ) .",
    "similarly , by an equivariant dg - module we mean one which carries a rational action of @xmath50 compatible with the other structures ( later , we will call this a `` naive @xmath50-action '' , to distinguish it from other related concepts ) .",
    "the smoothness assumption on @xmath60 is required in order to construct finite - dimensional ( derived ) stacks parametrizing modules .",
    "however , one can argue that the structure of general modules should not be relevant for the argument , which only involves @xmath62 and its pullbacks by the @xmath50-action . with that in mind",
    ", we will prove :    [ th : main4 ] let @xmath60 be a dg algebra over @xmath52 which is proper .",
    "suppose that it carries an action of @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a perfect dg module over @xmath60 which is rigid and simple .",
    "then @xmath62 is quasi - isomorphic to a @xmath50-equivariant dg module .",
    "the proof follows the same overall strategy as in @xcite while remaining elementary throughout .",
    "we first show that @xmath62 can carry a `` weak @xmath50-action '' .",
    "this is done by considering the pullbacks of @xmath62 as a family of modules over @xmath50 .",
    "next , there is an obstruction theory which equips @xmath62 with a series of higher homotopies added to the weak action , corresponding to the use of simplicial methods in @xcite .",
    "finally , there is an explicit `` gluing '' step which constructs the desired quasi - isomorphic module .",
    "ton informs me that his methods can also be adapted to give a proof of theorem [ th : main4 ] .    finally , to return to symplectic topology , note that our previous results about @xmath0 milnor fibres represent just one application of theorem [ th : main4 ] .",
    "there are more situations in which one expects fukaya categories of noncompact symplectic manifolds to have @xmath50-actions , such as the double suspensions considered in @xcite , and where the same algebraic ideas may be useful ( with this in mind , section [ sec : alternative ] takes a look at the results one can get for the @xmath0 milnor fibres _ without _ appealing to @xcite ) .",

    "_ this work answers a question posed to me by ivan smith , who also provided the basic idea of using group actions to attack it ( i ve probably interpreted that suggestion in a more algebraic way than he would have liked ) .",
    "a conversation with bertrand ton helped me greatly to understand the obstruction theory involved . during the preparation of the paper ,",
    "i was partially supported by nsf grant dms-1005288 .",
    "we recall some elements of the theory of @xmath63-structures ( not new of course , see for instance keller s papers @xcite ) .",
    "we consider @xmath63-algebras @xmath60 over @xmath52 , assuming for now that they are strictly unital .",
    "our sign conventions follow @xcite . in particular ,",

    "note that conversely , if @xmath60 is a general @xmath63-algebra , the cohomology @xmath66 becomes a graded associative algebra by applying the same sign change as in ( similar conventions apply to dg categories and @xmath63-categories ) .",
