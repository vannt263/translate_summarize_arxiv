    "despite the full understanding of the fundamental theory of weak interactions , the non - leptonic decay of hadrons still remains to be the least understood weak process , the most notable problems being @xmath12 rule and the calculation of @xmath13 .",
    "the predicament originates from the difficulty of evaluating the hadronic matrix element of the product of currents .",
    "much work has already been done to attack this problem using lattice qcd simulations@xcite , but they have not yielded satisfactory results .",
    "difficulties have proven to be especially severe for the the @xmath12 amplitudes@xcite . from the computational point of view",
    "the problem lies in a calculation of the so - called eye diagram , which suffers from extremely large statistical fluctuations@xcite .",
    "theoretically , this may be related to mixing of the dimension six weak operator responsible for the decay with operators of lower dimensions whose coefficients diverge linearly in the continuum limit . at a more fundamental level",
    ", there is the difficulty @xcite that the @xmath2 3-point function evaluated in euclidean space - time does not yield information on the phase of the decay amplitude .",
    "calculation of the @xmath14 process is known to be easier than that of the @xmath12 process . for this case mixing of lower dimension operators",
    "is absent , and the so - called figure - eight diagrams which represent the @xmath14 amplitude , have clear signals in numerical simulations .",
    "indeed lattice calculations have been reported by several groups@xcite quite a long time ago .",
    "the problem , however , was that the results turned out to be inconsistent with experiment : lattice calculations have given the amplitude roughly a factor of two larger than experiment .",
    "two potential origins are suspected to give this discrepancy .",
    "one is an issue in the matching of the lattice and continuum operators .",
    "early studies employed the factor @xmath15 for the quark wave function normalization and the bare lattice coupling constant for estimating the renormalization factor of the four - quark weak operator .",
    "it is by now well known that the klm factor @xmath16@xcite and tadpole - improved perturbation theory@xcite are more adequate for the operator matching .",
    "another problem concerns the use of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) to convert lattice results into the physical amplitude .",
    "only the tree - level formula was known and used in the previous work .",
    "the meson mass dependence of lattice calculations appeared consistent with the prediction of the tree - level formula , allowing , however , for large statistical errors .",
    "it was probably necessary to use the formula including higher order chpt effects , but its necessity was not manifest . an interesting development in this connection is a recent calculation of one - loop corrections to the @xmath11 amplitude in chpt by golterman and leung@xcite .",
    "applying their results to the old data obtained by bernard and soni@xcite , they found that one - loop effects decrease the physical amplitude by about 30% .    with the hope to improve the problems posed here , we have carried out a high statistics simulation of the @xmath11 amplitude in quenched lattice qcd , incorporating various theoretical and technical developments made in recent years . in particular , we discuss in detail how one - loop corrections of chpt affect physical predictions for the decay amplitude from lattice qcd simulations .",

    "in this article we have reported results of a study of the @xmath0 decay amplitude in quenched lattice qcd . with a set of high statistics simulations",
    "we have found that the results show sizable finite - size effects , which , however , are consistent with those predicted by a recent one - loop calculation of chpt .",
    "we have furthermore seen that a meson mass dependence which remains after inclusion of the one - loop corrections of chpt in the prediction for the decay amplitude is due to effects of the @xmath194 contact terms in the quenched theory . making an extrapolation to the chiral limit to remove these effects ,",
    "we have found @xmath251 for the physical value of the decay amplitude , depending on the choice of the cutoff parameter of chpt .",
    "these values are consistent with experiment ( @xmath233 ) .    the present result may be compared to those of the previous studies@xcite which gave decay amplitudes roughly twice larger than experiment .",
    "our smaller value originates from the two effects , one - loop corrections as also noted by golterman and leung in their reanalysis of the old results , and a decrease of the amplitude toward smaller values of @xmath171 .    as a further application of the one - loop formula",
    ", we have calculated the @xmath10 parameter , and found that it is consistent with a recent direct calculation for @xmath249 mixing .",
    "the encouraging results we have obtained , however , should be taken with several reservations .",
    "the value of the @xmath0 decay amplitude estimated in the chiral limit suffers from uncertainties of 1020% due to the @xmath194 contact terms of the full theory , because the phenomenological estimate available is not very accurate . a sizable finite - size correction of @xmath213% , while consistent with the one - loop prediction of chpt , raises the question whether ignoring higher order corrections can be justified .",
    "furthermore , various constants of chpt , in particular the coefficient @xmath172 , may differ between the quenched and full theories , and we have no way of estimating or correcting the difference .",
    "reliability of chpt for calculating unphysical amplitudes could also be an issue . reducing these sources of uncertainties , especially those related to quenching and better controlling finite - size effects would require a difficult task of carrying out simulations in full qcd on a physically large lattice .",
    "we thank maarten golterman for informative correspondence on his results for the decay amplitude from chiral perturbation theory .",
