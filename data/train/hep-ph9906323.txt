    "the bfkl equation [ 3 ] makes it possible to take account of the most leading @xmath4 terms at each order in @xmath5 , since it is the four - point gluon green s function containing all the information about the most important small-@xmath1 behaviour . at leading order , with fixed @xmath5 ,",
    "the bfkl equation is scale invariant , and has simple eigenfunction @xmath6 , with eigenvalues @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the mellin transformation of the kernel . transforming back to @xmath1 and @xmath8 space the leading small @xmath1 behaviour is driven by the saddle - point at @xmath9 , leading to small-@xmath1 behaviour of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , i.e. if @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "however , this result is potentially subject to large corrections . in particular",
    "the equation predicts large diffusion  within the gluon green s function the average virtuality @xmath15 but the spread of important values has a width @xmath16 .",
    "hence , there is considerable influence from both the infrared and ultraviolet regions of virtuality at small @xmath1 .",
    "if the coupling is allowed to run this will clearly be very important .",
    "recently the nlo bfkl equation became available [ 4,5 ] .",
    "not only does this provide information about the scale - invariant nlo corrections , but the running of the qcd coupling now becomes impossible to ignore  the nlo part of the kernel contains a term @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the renormalization scale , and this is absorbed into the renormalization group improved coupling , @xmath19 . having done this , a simple way to consider the effect of the nlo corrections to the bfkl kernel is to consider its action on the lo eigenfunctions @xmath20 .",
    "this results in a nlo _ eigenvalue _ of the form @xmath21 , which for @xmath9 leads to an intercept of @xmath22 .",
    "this is clearly a disaster , implying a very unconvergent expansion for the intercept .",
    "however , this simple approach requires modification .",
    "eigenvalue _ is not a real eigenvalue since it depends on @xmath8  the running coupling has broken scale invariance , changing the whole form of the bfkl equation . even for the lo bfkl equation ,",
    "the @xmath23 associated with a running coupling turns the @xmath24-space bfkl equation into a differential equation .",
    "this can formally be solved , and then inverted back to @xmath8-space . at leading twist",
    ", the solution factorizes into a @xmath8-dependent part @xmath25 and a @xmath26-dependent part [ 6 ] .",
    "the latter is ambiguous since the @xmath24-dependent integrand has a cut along the contour of integration of the inverse transformation .",
    "this is because the growth of the coupling in the infrared coupled with the strong infrared diffusion leads to an infrared divergence in the bfkl equation , and hence a renormalon contribution .",
    "therefore the running coupling equation has no prediction for the input for the gluon , this being sensitive to nonperturbative physics .",
    "conversely , @xmath25 is completely well - defined , being insensitive to infrared diffusion .",
    "however , it is influenced the ultraviolet diffusion , and hence by scales greater than @xmath8 , where the coupling is weak .",
    "calculating @xmath27 one extracts an unambiguous anomalous dimension @xmath28 governing the evolution of the gluon . considering for the moment the use of just the lo kernel",
    ", @xmath29 turns out to be the usual lo bfkl anomalous dimension @xmath30 , with @xmath5 evaluated at @xmath8 , plus an infinite series of corrections which are a power series in @xmath31 compared to the lo . transforming to @xmath1 space",
    "one finds that each term in the series behaves like @xmath32 as @xmath33 , but with accompanying powers of @xmath34 which grow as the power of @xmath35 grows .",
    "hence a resummation of running coupling dependent terms is necessary .",
    "the series is too complicated to sum exactly , so some prescription must be used .",
    "i choose the blm prescription [ 7 ] , which adjusts the scale of the coupling in the lo expression to @xmath36 so that using @xmath37 in the lo splitting function one generates precisely the nlo @xmath38-dependent correction to the splitting function . choosing @xmath36 in this manner one can find an exact expression for the scale choice in the effective coupling , and in the small @xmath1 limit it is @xmath39 , ( see [ 8 ] for details ) , which is entirely consistent with influence from the diffusion into the ultraviolet . the effective coupling is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "it is possible to check whether this prescription is sensible .",
    "if the summation of the complete series is generated by this effective scale then the whole series is given by using @xmath40 in the lo splitting function .",
    "this can be checked explicitly for the @xmath41 term .",
    "the agreement between the term generated in this manner and that calculated explicitly is excellent until very small @xmath1 indeed , i.e. , the @xmath41 term leads to a modification to the scale of @xmath42 .",
    "checks at higher order in @xmath31 give similar results .",
    "-0.1 in    ( 120,85)(-15,8 )    -0.1 in    -0.2 in    one can also solve for @xmath29 numerically and compare with the transformed splitting function using the effective scale . due to a zero in @xmath43 ( first noticed in the context of a resummed kernel in [ 9 ] )",
    ", the anomalous dimension has a leading pole for @xmath44 , which for @xmath45 is at @xmath46 , leading to a splitting function @xmath47 .",
    "however , the numerical @xmath28 is in very good agreement with the transformation of @xmath48 until one gets extremely near the pole ",
    "the replacement @xmath49 is extremely effective until very small @xmath1 indeed ( see [ 10 ] for details ) . at @xmath50 the corrections from @xmath51 and beyond act to stop the decrease of the coupling at even smaller @xmath1 and freeze it at @xmath52 .",
    "the validity of using the effective coupling can also be checked by solving the nlo bfkl equation with running coupling , first defined in [ 11 ] .",
    "now , as well as @xmath38-dependent corrections to the naive lo result there is also an @xmath53 correction not involved with the running of the coupling , and ignoring @xmath38-dependent effects the nlo correction to the intercept of the splitting function is indeed @xmath54 the lo .",
    "however , one may use the same type of prescription for fixing the scale in the nlo contribution to the splitting function as at lo , finding that , although it is not necessary , the @xmath55 appropriate for this nlo correction is the same as at lo [ 8 ] .",
    "this is both for the @xmath39 behaviour for @xmath56 and the freezing below this ",
    "the @xmath33 nlo corrected splitting function does not behave like the naive @xmath57 , but like @xmath58 for @xmath59 [ 10 ] .",
    "hence , the perturbative expansion is more stable .",
    "exact calculations at finite @xmath1 show that the nlo correction to the splitting function leads to fairly small corrections to the evolution [ 8 ] .",
    "i note that other authors have considered partial resummations of the bfkl kernel which provide improved stability besides that associated with the running coupling [ 12,11,9 ] .",
    "these are necessary for single - scale processes , but i feel they are less important for structure functions than running coupling effects .",
    "in order to apply these results to a study of structure functions it is necessary to calculate the small @xmath1 expansions for the physical splitting functions [ 13 ] which give the evolution of @xmath60 and @xmath61 in terms of each other , in order to avoid factorization scheme ambiguities .",
    "this results in @xmath55 of exactly the same form as above . in order to compare with data one",
    "can then combine these small @xmath1 expansions with the normal expansions in powers of @xmath5 in the manner in [ 14 ] . at present",
    "there is only sufficient information to work at lo in this combined expansion .",
    "however , it is possible to use effective scales at large @xmath1 using similar considerations as above , finding a coupling which grows as @xmath62 .",
    "a global analysis of structure function data can be performed ( with constraints applied for other data , e.g. prompt photon , high @xmath63 jets ) , and the results are very good .",
    "the @xmath64 for 1330 data points is 1339 compared to 1511 for the standard nlo in @xmath5 mrst fit [ 15 ] .",
    "not only is the fit improved but , whereas the input gluon ( and therefore input @xmath61 ) in the conventional approach is valencelike at @xmath65 , @xmath61 in this approach is the same general shape as @xmath60 at this low @xmath66 .",
    "the prediction for @xmath61 in the hera range is smaller than that using the conventional approach , being similar to [ 14 ] .",
    "hence , i believe that the correct way to take account of the @xmath4 terms in the calculation of structure functions is to use the combined expansion for physical splitting functions , and the @xmath67 given by resumming @xmath38-dependent terms .",
    "this is preferred by current @xmath60 data , and predictions for other quantities are different from the conventional approach .",
