    "low - dimensional electron gas systems confined in semiconductor heterostructures provide ideal systems for the study of electron - electron interactions , providing a high degree of structural quality and control .",
    "the usual theoretical approach adopted for the description of the collective excitation spectra of such systems is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "however , the rpa does not include the effects of exchange and correlation , which are expected to be much more important in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems than in 3d , and to increase in importance as the number density of the system decreases.@xcite to account for these effects , many authors have gone beyond the rpa for a description of the excitation spectra of such systems,@xcite by adopting the local field theories of hubbard@xcite and singwi , tosi , land and sjlander ( stls),@xcite which include corrections for exchange and correlation in a simple , physically motivated manner;@xcite the success of these approaches can be seen by comparing their results against monte carlo calculations.@xcite there have also been reports of a number of alternative approaches for including exchange - correlation effects in the excitation spectra of two - dimensional electron systems by adopting : ( i ) a non - local approach within a hartree - fock approximation for the evaluation of the irreducible polarisability ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs . and",
    "for the case of intersubband excitations in quantum wells ) ; ( ii ) alternative static local field approaches such as the quasi - localized charge method;@xcite ( iii ) a dynamic local field approach within the quantum stls theory.@xcite however , the static local field stls approach has remained a firm favourite in the published literature .",
    "tests of local field theories for three - dimensional systems have been reported for , _",
    "e.g. _ , aluminium@xcite but there are relatively few reliable experimental tests of these widely used theories in the density range applicable to semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "we report here such an experimental test and demonstrate that static local field corrections are unable to provide an accurate description of exchange correlation behaviour in low dimensional electron gases .",
    "indeed we will argue that our results point to the need to examine _ dynamical _ local field theories , embodied by a _ complex _ local field factor to achieve a more accurate description of our experimental results .",
    "electron bilayers ( two parallel 2degs in close proximity , produced by mbe - growth of a gaas / algaas modulation - doped double quantum well heterostructure ) have been identified as useful systems for the study of electron correlations in low - dimensional electron systems because the inter - layer coulomb interaction can effectively counterbalance the kinetic energy of the electrons , allowing many body effects to dominate .",
    "such a system supports two plasmon modes corresponding to the in - phase ( optic plasmon , op ) and out - of - phase ( acoustic plasmon , ap ) intra - sub - band oscillations of the charge densities in each layer.@xcite liu _",
    "et al . _ have shown that electron correlations can push the acoustic plasmon curve completely into the single - particle excitation ( spe ) spectrum , resulting in landau damping of the mode at much smaller wavevectors than predicted by the rpa.@xcite the acoustic plasmon may therefore be used as a probe of exchange - correlation effects in 2deg systems , and of landau damping effects .",
    "raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the study of the electronic excitation spectra of low - dimensional semiconductor systems.@xcite for example , measurements of intersubband excitations in quantum wells have indicated the importance of exchange - correlation in these systems.@xcite applying angle resolved raman techniques to electron bilayers , we have recently determined the dispersion of the acoustic plasmon of a double quantum well structure.@xcite however , the in - plane wavevectors @xmath3 accessible ( @xmath4 [ the fermi wavevector ] , for 2deg areal densities @xmath5 ) , determined by the wavelength of the incident light , are too small to probe exchange - correlation corrections to the ap dispersion , as predicted in ref . . attempts to extend the wavevector range by overlaying a grating to couple in higher wavevector transfers@xcite did not provide significantly clear results for any conclusions to be drawn ; the superposition of the folded ap and op branches in the reduced brillouin zone of the grating leads to ambiguities in any analysis of the form of the plasmon dispersions.@xcite however , substantial overlap between the spe continuum and the ap can be obtained by increasing the electron temperature , resulting in the landau damping of the plasmon , as we have demonstrated recently.@xcite    in this earlier work we characterised the dependence of the landau damping of the ap mode in a bilayer system on electron temperature @xmath0 by comparing the ap peak widths measured using raman spectroscopy with those calculated using the rpa and the rpa including a hubbard ( static , zero-@xmath0 ) local field correction ( h - rpa ) to account for exchange - correlation effects.@xcite the h - rpa agreed better with the data for low temperatures ( @xmath6 , the fermi temperature ) than did the rpa , suggesting that exchange - correlation effects are important even for the comparatively high 2deg densities used ; but for higher @xmath0 , the rpa gave a better fit , suggesting that at higher temperatures ( @xmath7 ) exchange - correlation effects become less significant and the rpa the more appropriate approach .",
    "the temperature dependence of the coulomb drag between two 2degs has also been employed recently to study the effects of electron correlations in bilayer systems.@xcite the drag mechanism was attributed to landau damping of the ap,@xcite but although inclusion of a 0  k hubbard local field correction provided a better description of the data than that given by the rpa,@xcite overall agreement between experiment and theory was not achieved . in both these raman and coulomb drag studies@xcite it was suggested that using a static local field correction which was @xmath0-dependent might be important , and the present work addresses this point in detail by comparing experimental data with corresponding calculations .",
    "we present here raman scattering measurements of the landau damping induced width of the ap as a function of @xmath0 , and hence obtain a measure of the overlap of the ap with the spe continuum and of the importance of exchange and correlation in these systems .",
    "the data are modelled using calculations ( taking full account of the finite thickness of the quasi-2degs , and of phenomenological damping ) in : ( i ) the rpa , which is expected to provide a good description when exchange and correlation are not important ; ( ii ) the rpa with a 0 k hubbard local field correction to account for exchange - correlation effects ( h - rpa ) ; ( iii ) the self - consistent stls approach , _ modified to include non - zero @xmath0_. most previous theoretical work on exchange - correlation effects in electron bilayers has assumed @xmath8  k ( _ e_.g . refs . to ) , but a key feature of our experimental work is that we have raised @xmath0 substantially ( @xmath9 ) , and it is important to account for these observations .",
    "the capacity of the stls approach to include exchange - correlation effects more reliably that the h - rpa at low @xmath0 is not especially relevant here ; indeed , at the relatively high 2deg densities and momentum range considered here , the rpa and the stls approach should produce similar results.@xcite what is important is that the stls can be readily modified to account for the effects of non - zero @xmath0 on the static local field corrections .",
    "as will be shown , there remain discrepancies between our experimental results and those predicted by these theoretical descriptions of electron fluids at non - zero @xmath0 , and this is one of the central conclusions of this work . in particular , the static stls and more generally _ all _ static local field factors fail to describe effectively the effects of exchange and correlation in a non - degenerate 2deg .",
    "however , our results do suggest that a _ dynamic _ local field correction could provide an effective description .",
    "the theoretical approaches employed are considered in section [ theorysec ] and appendix [ stlsapp ] , in which we also provide an overview of the rpa , h - rpa and stls approximations for electron bilayers .",

    "details of the experimental measurements are provided in section [ expt ] and in section [ res ] we present the results of our raman scattering measurements and discuss them in terms of the theoretical models .",
    "our starting point for a theoretical description of the excitation spectrum of a double quantum well system is the rpa , which has been used extensively for the study of the collective excitations in low - dimensional electron systems,@xcite including electron bilayers.@xcite throughout , we will be concerned with excitations of angular frequency @xmath10 and wavevector ( parallel to the planes of the 2degs ) @xmath11 .",

    "[ densdep ] and [ unequal ] ) also indicate that changes in background screening ( from , _",
    "e.g. _ , un - ionised donors in the doped algaas layers ) are not responsible for the reduction in @xmath187 from the theoretical values .",
    "if this were the case , we would expect @xmath190 to be affected to a much greater extent , as seen in the widths of the two plasmon peaks ( see section [ res1 ] and fig . [ tdepstack ] ) .",
    "in addition , although increased screening would reduce @xmath187 , the spe continuum would be unaffected , resulting in increased landau damping , contrary to observation .",
    "therefore it appears that the inability of our calculations to model our experimental results for the energy and damping of the ap can not be simply attributed to an experimental artifact , such as a decrease in 2deg density with temperature .",

    "nevertheless , it is significant that the only way in which we have been able to obtain agreement between experiment and theory is through the incorporation of a complex local field correction .",
    "finally , we observe that our conclusions are consistent with the results of measurements of the ap - mediated coulomb drag between two electron layers in samples similar to that studied here.@xcite in particular , in such experiments the onset temperature for plasmon enhancement of the drag rate is determined by the energies of the acoustic plasmons .",
    "a suppression of the ap energies from that expected within the rpa , as observed in our raman measurements , should lead to the plasmon enhancement in the coulomb drag rate occurring at a lower temperature than that predicted by the rpa ; this is indeed observed in refs . and .",

    "further , the behaviour of the ap energy and damping can not be reconciled to the calculations by a reduction with @xmath0 of the 2deg density , or a redistribution of electrons between the two quantum wells .",

    "<S> we report angle - resolved raman scattering observations of the temperature dependent landau damping of the acoustic plasmon in an electron bilayer system realised in a gaas double quantum well structure . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding calculations of the charge - density excitation spectrum of the electron bilayer using forms of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , and the static local field formalism of singwi , tosi , land and sjlander ( stls ) extended to incorporate non - zero electron temperature @xmath0 and phenomenological damping , are also presented . </S>",
    "<S> the stls calculations include details of the temperature dependence of the intra- and inter - layer local field factors and pair - correlation functions . good agreement between experiment and the various theories is obtained for the acoustic plasmon energy and damping for @xmath1 , the fermi temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , contrary to current expectations , all of the calculations show significant departures from our experimental data for @xmath2 . from this , we go on to demonstrate unambiguously that real local field factors fail to provide a physically accurate description of exchange correlation behaviour in low dimensional electron gases . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest instead that one must resort to a _ </S>",
    "<S> dynamical _ local field theory , characterised by a _ complex _ field factor to provide a more accurate description . </S>"
