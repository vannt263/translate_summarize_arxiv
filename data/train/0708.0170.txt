    "when einstein was asked about the meaning of time he used to say : `` time is the reading of a clock '' . taking this answer seriously ,",
    "one is forced to accept that time is directly defined only at the position of a clock ; if one wants to assign a time to events at some distance from the clock one needs an additional prescription . as such prescription ,",
    "einstein suggested the radar method with light rays .",
    "although originally designed for special relativity , the radar method works equally well in general relativity .",
    "what one needs is a clock in an arbitrary general - relativistic spacetime . here and in the following , our terminology is as follows .",
    "general - relativistic spacetime _ is a 4-dimensional manifold @xmath0 with a smooth metric tensor field @xmath1 of lorentzian signature and a time orientation ; the latter means that a globally consistent distinction between future and past has been made .",
    "a _ clock _ is a smooth embedding @xmath2 from a real interval into @xmath0 such that the tangent vector @xmath3 is everywhere timelike with respect to @xmath1 and future - pointing .",
    "this terminology is justified because we can interpret the value of the parameter @xmath4 as the reading of a clock .",
    "note that our definition of a clock does not demand that `` its ticking be uniform '' in any sense . only smoothness and monotonicity is required .",
    "the radar method assigns a time and a distance to an event @xmath5 in the following way .",
    "one has to send a light ray from an event on the curve @xmath6 , say @xmath7 , to @xmath5 and receive the reflected light ray at another event on @xmath6 , say @xmath8 , see figure [ fig : radneigh ] . the _ radar time _ @xmath9 and the _ radar distance _ @xmath10 of the event @xmath5 with respect to @xmath6",
    "are then defined by @xmath11 @xmath12 here and in the following , `` light ray '' tacitly means `` freely propagating light ray '' , i.e. , it is understood that there is no optical medium and that mirrors or other appliances that deviate a light ray are not used . adopting the standard formalism of general relativity , `` light ray '' is then just another word for `` lightlike geodesic of the spacetime metric @xmath1 '' .    in the following",
    "we discuss the radar method from a geometrical point of view , reviewing some known results and formulating a few new ones .",
    "the radar method has obvious relevance for the communication with satellites in the solar system , because all such communication is made with the help of electromagnetic radiation that can be modeled , in almost all cases , in terms of light rays . by sending a light ray to a satellite and receiving the reflected signal",
    "the radar time @xmath9 and the radar distance @xmath10 of events at the satellite are directly measurable quantities .",
    "note that we do not need an experimentalist at the event @xmath5 where the light ray is reflected ; a passive reflecting body , such as the lageos satellites , would do .",
    "the radar time @xmath9 and the radar distance @xmath10 of an event @xmath5 with respect to a clock @xmath6 are well - defined if there is precisely one future - pointing and precisely one past - pointing light ray from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "neither existence nor uniqueness of such light rays is guaranteed .",
    "it is possible that an event @xmath5 can not be connected to @xmath6 by any future - pointing ( or any past - pointing ) light ray .",
    "there are two physically different situations in which this occurs : first , @xmath5 may be in a `` shadow '' of some obstacle that lies in the direction to @xmath6 ; second , @xmath5 may be behind an `` event horizon '' of @xmath6 , see figure [ fig : shadhor ] .",
    "it is also possible that an event @xmath5 can be connected to @xmath6 by two or more future - pointing ( or past - pointing ) light rays .",
    "whenever the future light cone ( or the past light cone ) of @xmath5 has a caustic or a transverse self - intersection , it meets some timelike curves at least twice , see @xcite or @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "if the past light cone of @xmath5 intersects @xmath6 at least twice , an observer at @xmath5 sees two or more images of @xmath6 , i.e. , we are in a gravitational lensing situation .",
    "figure [ fig : cone ] shows an example of a past light cone that has two intersections with appropriately chosen timelike curves , as is geometrically evident from the picture .",
    "these observations clearly show that , in an arbitrary general - relativistic spacetime , the radar method does not work globally .",
    "however , it always works locally .",
    "this is demonstrated by the following simple proposition .",
    "[ prop : radneigh ] let @xmath6 be a clock in an arbitrary general - relativistic spacetime and @xmath13 some point on @xmath6",
    ". then there are open subsets @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the spacetime with @xmath16 such that every point @xmath5 in @xmath17 can be connected to the worldline of @xmath6 by precisely one future - pointing and precisely one past - pointing light ray that stays within @xmath15 , see figure @xmath18 . in this case",
    ", @xmath14 is called a _ radar neighborhood _ of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath6 .    to prove this , we just have to recall that every point in a general - relativistic spacetime admits a convex normal neighborhood , i.e. , a neighborhood @xmath15 such that any two points in @xmath15 can be connected by precisely one geodesic that stays within @xmath15 .",
    "having chosen such a @xmath15 , it is easy to verify that every sufficiently small neighborhood @xmath14 of @xmath19 satisfies the desired property .",
    "as an aside , we mention that the existence of radar neighborhoods , in the sense of proposition [ prop : radneigh ] , was chosen as one of the axioms in the axiomatic approach to spacetime theory by ehlers , pirani and schild @xcite .",
    "if @xmath14 is a radar neighborhood , the radar time @xmath9 and the radar distance @xmath10 are well - defined functions on @xmath17 . by continuous extension onto the image of @xmath6",
    "one gets smooth hypersurfaces @xmath20 that intersect @xmath6 orthogonally ; hence , they are spacelike near @xmath6 .",
    "note , however , that they need not be spacelike on the whole radar neighborhood .",
    "the hypersurfaces @xmath21 have a cylindrical topology , see figure [ fig : radco ] .",
    "incidentally , if one replaces ( [ eq : deft ] ) by @xmath22 with any number @xmath19 between 0 and 1 , each hypersurface @xmath20 gets a conic singularity at the intersection point with @xmath6 .",
    "this clearly shows that the choice of the factor 1/2 is the most natural and the most convenient one .",
    "( if one allows for _ direction - dependent _ factors , one can get smooth hypersurfaces with factors other than 1/2 .",
    "this idea , which however seems a little bit contrived , was worked out by havas @xcite where the reader can find more on the `` conventionalism debate '' around the factor 1/2 . )    by covering @xmath6 with radar neighborhoods @xmath14 ( and the pertaining convex normal neighborhoods @xmath15 ) , it is easy to verify that @xmath9 and @xmath10 coincide on the intersection of any two radar neighborhoods . hence , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are well - defined on some tubular neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "we will now investigate how large this neighborhood can be for the case of a clock moving in the solar system , the latter being modeled by the schwarzschild spacetime around the sun .    to that end",
    "we consider the schwarzschild spacetime around a non - transparent spherical body of radius @xmath23 and mass @xmath24 .",
    "( the radius is measured in terms of the radial schwarzschild coordinate and for the mass we use geometrical units , i.e. , the schwarzschild radius is @xmath25 . ) using the standard deflection formula for light rays in the schwarzschild spacetime , the following result can be easily verified .",
    "if a bundle of light rays comes in initially parallel from infinity , the rays that graze the surface of the central body will meet the axis of symmetry of the bundle at radius @xmath26 see figure [ fig : rf ] .",
    "this radius @xmath27 is sometimes called the _ focal length _ of a non - transparent body of radius @xmath23 and mass @xmath24 .",
    "if we insert the values of our sun we find @xmath28 where 1 a.u .",
    "= 1 astronomical unit is the average distance from the earth to the sun . from any event at @xmath29 ,",
    "the future - pointing and past - pointing light rays spread out without intersecting each other .",
    "they cover the whole space @xmath30 with the exception of those points that lie in the `` shadow '' cast by the central body , see figure [ fig : rf ] .",
    "by contrast , light rays from an event at @xmath31 do intersect ; the past light cone of such an event is shown in figure [ fig : cone ] .    as a consequence , for a clock @xmath6 moving arbitrarily in the region @xmath30 , an event @xmath5 at a radius @xmath32 with @xmath33 can be connected to the worldline of @xmath6 by at most one future - pointing and at most one past - pointing light ray .",
    "we shall make the additional assumption that @xmath6 is inextendible and approaches neither the surface of the central body nor infinity in the future or in the past .",
    "this assures that there are no event horizons for @xmath6 . as a consequence ,",
    "any event @xmath5 at radius @xmath32 with @xmath34 can be connected to @xmath6 by precisely one future - pointing and precisely one past - pointing light ray unless @xmath6 moves through the shadow cast by the central body for light rays issuing from @xmath5 .",
    "an event @xmath5 at radius @xmath31 , on the other hand , may be connected to the worldline of a clock by several future - pointing ( or past - pointing ) light rays .",
    "this is geometrically evident from figure [ fig : cone ] .",
    "so for any clock in the solar system the radar method assigns a unique time @xmath9 and a unique distance @xmath10 to any event at radius @xmath29 , with the exception of those events for which the clock lies in the shadow of the central body .",
    "note that for all existing spacecraft the distance from the sun is considerably smaller than @xmath35 a.u .",
    "( in october 2005 , the spacecraft farthest away from the sun was pioneer 10 with a distance of 89 a.u . )",
    "the idea of sending a spacecraft to @xmath36 a.u . was brought forward by eshleman @xcite in 1979 .",
    "what makes this idea attractive is the possibility of observing distant light sources strongly magnified by the focusing effect of the gravitational field of the sun , see again figure [ fig : rf ] . for a detailed discussion of the perspectives of such a mission see turyshev and andersson @xcite",
    "it should be emphasized that our consideration applies only to a non - transparent body .",
    "if the central body is transparent , light rays passing through the central region of the body are focussed at a radius that is much smaller than the @xmath27 given above .",
    "if the interior is modeled by a perfect fluid with constant density , one finds for the sun a focal length of 30 a.u .",
    ", in comparison to the 550 a.u . for the non - tranparent case , see nemiroff and ftaclas @xcite .",
    "a transparent sun is a reasonable model for neutrino radiation ( which travels approximately , though not precisely , on lightlike geodesics ) and for gravitational radiation ( which travels along lightlike geodesics if modeled as a linear perturbation of the schwarzschild background ) .",
    "so , the focusing at 30 a.u . might have some futuristic perspective in view of neutrino astronomy and gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "if we reparametrize the curve @xmath6 , the hypersurfaces @xmath37 and @xmath38 change . therefore , the radar method can be used to characterize distinguished parametrizations of worldlines , i.e. , distinguished clocks . in a general - relativistic spacetime",
    ", the standard clock parametrization is defined by the condition @xmath39 where @xmath1 is the spacetime metric .",
    "this defines a parametrization along any timelike curve that is unique up to affine transformations , @xmath40 with real constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "as we restrict to future - pointing parametrizations , @xmath41 must be positive .",
    "then the choice of @xmath41 determines the unit and the choice of @xmath42 determines the zero on the dial . by choosing @xmath41 appropriately , we can fix the unit of a standard clock such that @xmath43 .",
    "then the parameter of the clock is called _ proper time_. note that under an affine reparametrization @xmath44 the radar time and the radar distance transform according to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , i.e. , the hypersurfaces @xmath37 and @xmath38 are relabeled but remain unchanged .    with the help of the radar method one can formulate an operational prescription that allows to test whether a clock is a standard clock .",
    "this prescription is now briefly reviewed , for details and proofs see @xcite .",
    "here we assume that the test is made in a general - relativistic spacetime ; in @xcite the more general case of a weylian spacetime is considered .    to test whether a clock @xmath6 behaves like a standard clock in a particular event @xmath47 , we emit at this event two freely falling particles in spatially opposite directions .",
    "these two freely falling particles are mathematically modeled by timelike geodesics @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the condition that they are emitted in spatially opposite directions means that the future - oriented tangent vector to @xmath6 is a convex linear combination of the future - oriented tangent vectors to @xmath48 and @xmath49 . if we restrict to a radar neighborhood of @xmath47 , the radar method assigns a time @xmath9 and a distance @xmath10 to each event on @xmath48 , and a time @xmath50 and a distance @xmath51 to each event on @xmath49 , see figure [ fig : standard ] .",
    "these quantities can be actually measured provided that the two freely falling particles are reflecting objects . from these measured quantities",
    "we can calculate the differential quotients @xmath52 and @xmath53 along @xmath48 and the differential quotients @xmath54 and @xmath55 along @xmath49 , i.e. , the _ radar velocity _ and the _ radar acceleration _ of the two freely falling particles .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the standard clock condition ( [ eq : standard ] ) holds at @xmath56 ( which corresponds to @xmath57 ) if and only if @xmath58 this prescription can be used , in particular , to directly test whether atomic clocks are standard clocks .",
    "all experiments so far are in agreement with this hypothesis , but a direct test has not been made .",
    "there are alternative characterizations of standard clocks by marzke and wheeler @xcite and kundt and hoffman @xcite which also work with light rays and freely falling particles .",
    "the advantages of the method reviewed here in comparison to these two older methods are outlined in @xcite .",
    "given any clock @xmath6 in any general - relativistic spacetime , the radar method assigns , as outlined above , to each event @xmath5 in some tubular neighborhood of @xmath6 a radar time @xmath9 and a radar distance @xmath10 . in order to get a coordinate system ( _",
    "radar coordinates _ ) on this tubular neighborhood , we may add two angular coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the following way .",
    "choose at each point @xmath61 an orthonormal tetrad @xmath62 , smoothly dependent on @xmath4 , such that @xmath63 is future - pointing and tangent to @xmath6 .",
    "to each event @xmath5 consider the past - oriented light ray , in the notation of figure [ fig : radneigh ] , from @xmath8 to @xmath5 .",
    "the tangent vector to this light ray at @xmath8 must be proportional to a vector of the form @xmath64 which defines @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "thus , @xmath59 and @xmath60 indicate at which point on the sky of @xmath6 the event @xmath5 is seen .",
    "just as with ordinary spherical coordinates , there are coordinate singularities at @xmath65 and at @xmath66 , and @xmath60 has to be identified with @xmath67 . apart from these obvious pathologies , the radar coordinates @xmath68 form a well - defined coordinate system on some tubular neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "there are two possibilities of modifying the radar coordinates without changing the information contained in them .",
    "first , one may replace @xmath9 and @xmath10 by @xmath69 and @xmath70 , according to ( [ eq : deft ] ) and ( [ eq : defr ] ) , and use the modified radar coordinates @xmath71 .",
    "second , one may switch to cartesian - like coordinates @xmath72 by introducing @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 in order to remove the coordinate singularities at @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "radar coordinates have been used as a tool , e.g. , in the axiomatic approach to spacetime theory of schrter and schelb @xcite .",
    "we will now compare radar coordinates with two other kinds of coordinate systems that can be introduced near the worldline of any clock @xmath78 : `` optical coordinates '' and `` fermi coordinates '' .",
    "we will see that there are some similarities but also major differences between these three types of coordinate systems . for an alternative discussion of optical coordinates and fermi",
    "coordinates see synge @xcite .    _",
    "optical coordinates _ were introduced by temple @xcite . the alternative name _",
    "observational coordinates _ is also common , see ellis et al .",
    "they assign to the event @xmath5 the four - tuple @xmath79 , where @xmath70 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 have the same meaning as above and @xmath80 is the `` affine length '' ( or `` projected length '' ) along the past - oriented light ray from @xmath8 to @xmath5 . using the exponential map @xmath81 determined by the spacetime metric",
    ", @xmath80 can be defined by the equation @xmath82 just as radar coordinates , optical coordinates are well - defined , apart from the obvious coordinate singularities at @xmath83 and @xmath66 on some tubular neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "the boundary of this neighborhood is reached when the past light cone of an event on @xmath6 develops a caustic or a transverse self - intersection .",
    "( beyond such points , the optical coordinates are multi - valued .",
    "this does not mean that they are useless there ; however , they do not define a coordinate system in the usual sense . ) as radar coordinates require a similar condition not only on past light cones but also on future light cones , the domain of radar coordinates is always contained in the domain of optical coordinates .",
    "also , there is an important advantage of optical coordinates in view of calculations : optical coordinates only require to calculate the past - pointing lightlike geodesics issuing from points on @xmath6 ; radar coordinates require to calculate past - pointing and future - pointing lightlike geodesics from points on @xmath6 , and to determine their intersections .",
    "nonetheless , for applications in the solar system radar coordinates are advantageous because they have an operational meaning . in principle",
    ", optical coordinates also have an operational meaning : @xmath84 are the same as in radar coordinates , and for the affine ( or projected ) length @xmath80 a prescription of measurement was worked out by ruse @xcite after this length measure had been introduced mathematically by kermack , mccrea and whittaker @xcite .",
    "however , this prescription requires the distribution of assistants with rigid rods along each light ray issuing from @xmath6 into the past which is , of course , totally unrealistic in an astronomical situation . in this sense ,",
    "optical coordinates have an operational meaning only in principle but not in practice , whereas radar coordinates have an operational meaning both in principle and in practice , at least in the solar system .",
    "in cosmology , however , this is no longer true .",
    "then the radar coordinates , just as the optical coordinates , have an operational meaning only in principle but not in practice : sending a light ray to a distant galaxy and waiting for the reflected ray is a ridiculous idea . as a matter of fact ,",
    "optical coordinates are much more useful in cosmology than radar coordinates .",
    "although @xmath80 is not directly measurable , it is related in some classes of spacetimes to other distance measures , such as the redshift or the angular diameter distance , which can be used to replace @xmath80 . for applications of optical coordinates in cosmology see @xcite . as the simplest example , one may consider optical coordinates and radar coordinates in robertson - walker spacetimes , cf .",
    "jennison and mcvittie @xcite and fletcher @xcite .",
    "we now turn to _ fermi coordinates _ which were introduced by enrico fermi @xcite .",
    "let us recall how they are defined .",
    "as above , we have to choose along @xmath6 an orthonormal tetrad @xmath62 with @xmath85 tangent to @xmath6 .",
    "following fermi , we require that the covariant derivative of each spatial axis @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) is parallel to the tangent of @xmath6",
    "fermi transport _ law can be operationally realized by means of gyroscope axes @xcite or synge s _ bouncing photon _",
    "method @xcite .",
    "( actually , the construction below can be carried through equally well if the spatial axes are not fermi parallel .",
    "what is needed is only smooth dependence on the foot - point , just as with radar coordinates and optical coordinates . )",
    "then every event @xmath5 in a sufficiently small tubular neighborhood of @xmath6 can be written in the form @xmath88 the fermi coordinates of the point @xmath5 are the four numbers @xmath89 .",
    "thus , each surface @xmath90 is generated by the geodesics issuing orthogonally from the point @xmath91 .",
    "the distance @xmath92 is defined analogously to the affine length in the optical coordinates , but now along spacelike rather than lightlike geodesics .",
    "also , the angular coordinates @xmath93 and @xmath94 are analogous to the angular coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the radar and optical coordinates , but now they indicate the direction of a spacelike vector , rather than the direction of the spatial part of a lightlike vector . just as the other two coordinate systems , fermi coordinates",
    "are well - defined only on some tubular neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "there are two reasons that limit this neighborhood .",
    "first , a hypersurface @xmath90 might develop caustics or self - intersections .",
    "second , two hypersurfaces @xmath90 might intersect .",
    "in contrast to radar coordinates , fermi coordinates are insensitive to reparametrizations of @xmath6 ( apart from the fact that the surfaces @xmath90 are relabeled ) .",
    "the difficulty involved in their calculation is the same as for optical coordinates which is considerably less than for radar coordinates , as already mentioned above .",
    "the essential drawback of fermi coordinates is in the fact that they have absolutely no operational meaning : none of the four coordinates @xmath95 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 can be measured because there is no prescription for physically realizing a spacelike geodesic orthogonal to a worldline .    in spite of this fact ,",
    "fermi coordinates have found many applications because sometimes physically relevant effects can be conveniently calculated in terms of fermi coordinates . for a plea in favor of fermi coordinates , in comparison to radar coordinates , see bini , lusanna and mashhoon @xcite . in minkowski spacetime , e.g. , it is fairly difficult to calculate the radar time hypersurfaces @xmath96 for an accelerating clock .",
    "by contrast , the fermi time hypersurfaces @xmath90 are just the hyperplanes perpendicular to the worldline which are quite easy to determine .",
    "( of course , for an accelerating clock these hyperplanes necessarily intersect , so they can not form a smooth foliation on all of minkowski spacetime . )",
    "it is an interesting question to ask for which clocks the radar time hypersurfaces @xmath97 coincide with the fermi time hypersurfaces @xmath90 . for standard clocks ( recall section [ sec : standard ] ) in minkowski spacetime , dombrowski , kuhlmann and proff @xcite have found the following answer .    [",
    "prop : coin ] let @xmath6 be a standard clock in minkowski spacetime .",
    "then the following two statements are equivalent .    * the radar time hypersurfaces @xmath97 are hyperplanes , i.e. , they coincide with the fermi time hypersurfaces @xmath90 . *",
    "the @xmath98-acceleration of @xmath6 is constant @xmath99i.e . , a fermi - transported vector along @xmath100 .",
    "a worldline with constant 4-acceleration in minkowski spacetime is either a straight line ( `` inertial observer '' , for which the 4-acceleration is zero ) or a hyperbola ( `` rindler observer '' , for which the 4-acceleration is a non - zero fermi - transported vector , see figure [ fig : shadhor ] ) .",
    "it is easy to check that , indeed , in both cases the radar time hypersurfaces with respect to proper time parametrization are hyperplanes .",
    "the non - trivial statement of proposition [ prop : coin ] is in the fact that these are the _ only _ cases for which the radar time hypersurfaces are hyperplanes .",
    "we end this section with a remark on the fact that the term `` radar coordinates '' has been used in the literature also in another way . instead of supplementing the radar time @xmath9 and the radar distance @xmath10 with two angular coordinates , one could choose a second clock @xmath101 which defines a radar time @xmath102 and a radar distance @xmath103 .",
    "if the two clocks are sufficiently close , @xmath104 can be used as coordinates on some open subset which is not a tubular neighborhood of either clock . of course",
    ", one can replace @xmath105 by @xmath106 according to ( [ eq : deft ] ) and ( [ eq : defr ] ) , and analogously @xmath107 by @xmath108 . in the coordinates",
    "@xmath109 , which are used e.g. by ehlers , pirani and schild @xcite , the coordinate hypersurfaces are light cones .",
    "thus , the construction makes use of the fact that four light cones generically intersect in a point .",
    "( two light cones generically intersect in a 2-dimensional manifold , where `` generically '' means that we have to exclude points where one of the light cones fails to be a submanifold and points where the two light cones are tangent .",
    "similarly , three light cones generically intersect in a 1-dimensional manifold . ) in this sense the radar coordinates of ehlers , pirani and schild are similar to the gps type coordinates of blagojevi , garecki , hehl and obukhov @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that the latter characterize each point as intersection of four future light cones that issue from four given worldlines ( `` gps satellites '' ) , whereas the former characterize each point as intersection of two future and two past light cones that issue from two given worldlines .",
    "let @xmath6 be a clock in an arbitrary general - relativistic spacetime , and consider a second clock @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath101 is sufficiently close to @xmath6 , the radar method , carried through with respect to the clock @xmath6 , assigns a unique time @xmath110 and a unique distance @xmath111 to each event @xmath112 .",
    "we say that @xmath101 is _ synchroneous _ to @xmath6 if @xmath113 for all @xmath114 in the considered time interval .",
    "( instead of synchroneous one may say _ einstein synchroneous _ or _ radar synchroneous _ to be more specific . ) clearly , for every worldline sufficiently close to @xmath6 there is a unique parametrization that is synchroneous to @xmath6 . selecting this particular parametrization",
    "is called _ synchronization _ with @xmath6 .",
    "note that the relation of being synchroneous is not symmetric : @xmath101 may be synchroneous to @xmath6 without @xmath6 being synchroneous to @xmath101 . as an example",
    ", we may choose two affinely parametrized straight timelike lines @xmath6 and @xmath101 in minkowski spacetime that are not parallel . if we arrange the parameters such that @xmath101 is synchroneous to @xmath6 , the converse is not true . also , the relation of being synchroneous is not transitive : if @xmath115 is synchroneous to @xmath6 and @xmath116 is synchroneous to @xmath101 , it is not guaranteed that @xmath116 is synchroneous to @xmath6 .",
    "this non - transitivity is best illustrated with the _ sagnac effect _ : consider a family of clocks along the rim of a rotating circular platform in minkowski spacetime . starting with any one of these clocks ,",
    "synchronize each clock with its neighbor on the right .",
    "then there is a deficit time interval after completing the full circle .",
    "the following proposition characterizes the special situation that two clocks are mutually synchroneous .",

    "if , from the position of one clock in @xmath15 , two other clocks in @xmath15 are seen at the same spot in the sky ( i.e. , one behind the other ) , then this will be true for all times . in a more geometric wording , property c requires that the light rays issuing from any one integral curve of @xmath15 into the past together with the integral curves of @xmath15 are surface forming . in hasse and perlick @xcite , observer fields with this property",

    "clearly , property c refers only to the motion of the clocks , but not to their `` ticking '' ( i.e. , not to the parametrization ) .",
    "hence , it is irrelevant whether we consider standard observer fields or non - standard observer fields .",
    "finally we turn to property d which is a way of saying that light rays from @xmath160 to @xmath161 take the same spatial paths as light rays from @xmath161 to @xmath160 .",
    "if this property is satisfied , there is a timelike 2-surface between @xmath160 and @xmath161 that is ruled by two families of lightlike geodesics .",
    "note that _ any _ timelike 2-surface is ruled by two families of lightlike curves ; in general , however , these will not be geodesics .",
    "foertsch , hasse and perlick @xcite have shown that a timelike 2-surface is ruled by two families of lightlike geodesics if and only if its second fundamental form is a multiple of its first fundamental form . in the mathematical literature ,",
    "such surfaces are called _ totally umbilic_. some constrution methods and examples of timelike totally umbilic 2-surfaces are discussed in foertsch , hasse and perlick @xcite .",
    "note that in an arbitrary spacetime totally umbilic 2-surfaces need not exist .",
    "this shows that property d , which requires such a 2-surface between any two sufficiently close integral curves of some observer field , is quite restrictive .",
    "a criterion is given in the following proposition .",
    "the proof of the `` if '' part follows from foertsch , hasse and perlick @xcite , proposition 3 . to prove the `` only if '' part , fix any event @xmath19 and let @xmath6 be the clock in @xmath15 that passes through @xmath19 . on a neighborhhood of @xmath19 , with the worldline of @xmath6 omitted , consider two vector fields @xmath174 and @xmath175 such that the integral curves of @xmath174 are future - pointing light rays and the integral curves of @xmath175 are past - pointing light rays issuing from the worldline of @xmath6 .",
    "this condition fixes @xmath174 and @xmath175 uniquely up to nowhere vanishing scalar factors .",
    "property d requires @xmath174 and @xmath175 to be surface forming and @xmath15 to be tangent to these surfaces .",
    "the first condition is true , by the well - known frobenius theorem , if and only if the lie bracket of @xmath174 and @xmath175 is a linear combination of @xmath174 and @xmath175 , and the second condition is true if and only if @xmath15 is a linear combination of @xmath174 and @xmath175 . as a consequence ,",
    "the lie bracket of @xmath175 and @xmath15 must be a linear combination of @xmath175 and @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath175 and @xmath15 must be surface forming .",
    "this proves that @xmath15 must satisfy property c. hence , by proposition [ prop : parallax ] , @xmath15 must be proportional to a conformal killing vector field . what remains to be shown",
    "is that this conformal killing vector field is irrotational , i.e. , hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "to that end we come back to the observation that @xmath15 is a linear combination of @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "this means that , for any integral curve of @xmath15 in the considered neighborhood , light rays from @xmath6 are seen in the same spatial direction in which light rays to @xmath6 are emitted .",
    "this is true , in particular , for integral curves of @xmath15 that are infinitesimally close to @xmath6 .",
