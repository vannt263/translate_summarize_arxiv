    "the habitable zone is defined as the region around a star where a planet with co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o as its main greenhouse gases can support liquid water at its surface @xcite .",
    "the habitable zone is relatively wide because of the silicate - weathering feedback @xcite .",
    "silicate - weathering is a geological process that removes co@xmath0 from the atmosphere and a negative ( stabilizing ) feedback is possible because this process is believed to run faster at higher temperatures and higher co@xmath0 partial pressures @xcite .",
    "the inner edge of the habitable zone is set by the moist or runaway greenhouse @xcite , which should not be influenced by the details of the silicate - weathering feedback since the co@xmath0 should have been drawn down to low levels when they occur .",
    "on the other hand , calculations of the outer edge of the habitable zone generally assume that the silicate - weathering feedback can maintain co@xmath0 at arbitrarily high levels . the outer edge",
    "is then marked by some threshold where adding co@xmath0 to the atmosphere no longer provides additional warming , for example if additional co@xmath0 increases rayleigh scattering more than it increases greenhouse warming @xcite .",
    "this picture essentially considers the asymptotic limit of unlimited co@xmath0 outgassing capacity .",
    "more recently it has been recognized that for finite co@xmath0 outgassing rates the maximum co@xmath0 that a planet can achieve may be lower than the co@xmath0 needed to keep that planet habitable at the outer edge of the habitable zone @xcite .",
    "this leads to what i will call the `` effective outer edge of the habitable zone , '' which will depend on the co@xmath0 outgassing rate and the functioning of silicate weathering on the planet . beyond the effective outer edge of the habitable zone , a planet may experience cycles @xcite between a globally frozen , snowball earth climate @xcite and a habitable climate .",
    "understanding and constraining the effective outer edge of the habitable zone is critical because it determines our estimate of the fraction of stars that host an earth - like planet @xcite , which is essential for planning future telescopes that would observe such planets .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate what determines the position of the effective outer edge of the habitable zone and what happens beyond the effective outer edge .",
    "the behavior of a planet in this regime is largely determined by its uncertain silicate - weathering behavior . instead of viewing this an an obstacle",
    ", i will exploit it to make progress on the problem .",
    "the importance and uncertainty of weathering justifies the use of a simple climate model since the errors associated with making the grave assumptions that such a model entails pale in comparison to the uncertainty in weathering .",
    "it also allows me to use a relatively simple weathering parameterization that captures the expected qualitative behavior .",
    "i will use the simplifying assumptions to derive useful formulae .",
    "this will allow us to understand issues such as which processes determine whether the effective outer edge of the habitable zone is inside the traditional outer edge of the habitable zone and how much the parameters associated with these processes would need to be changed from our best estimates of their values to change the qualitative behavior of the system .",
    "moreover , i am able to determine the conditions for climate cycles to occur beyond the effective outer edge of the habitable zone , an analytical solution for these cycles , and a formula for the period of the cycles . using more complicated climate and weathering models will alter quantitative results , but is unlikely to alter the qualitative dependencies on parameters that my formulae give .",
    "this work therefore complements recent work by @xcite and @xcite , who used more complicated radiative and climate models , but only explored a few values of weathering parameters .",
    "i will neglect sophisticated radiative @xcite and 3d calculations @xcite and consider the following linearized , zero - dimensional model of planetary climate , similar to that used by @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constants , @xmath4 is the global mean temperature , @xmath5 is the temperature of the reference state , @xmath6 is the atmospheric partial pressure of co@xmath0 , @xmath7 is the atmospheric partial pressure of co@xmath0 in the reference state , @xmath8 is the stellar flux , @xmath9 is the stellar flux in the reference state , @xmath10 is the heat capacity in units of j m@xmath11",
    "@xmath12c@xmath13 , @xmath14 is the temperature - dependent planetary albedo ( reflectivity ) , and @xmath15 is the albedo of the reference state .",
    "table  [ tab : params ] contains a list model parameters and their standard values .",
    "the values i use here are drawn from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , but it is important to emphasize that the arguments in this paper do not depend on the exact values chosen .",
    "i will let the albedo be specified by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the albedo of the warm climate state ; @xmath18 is the albedo of the cold and icy , `` snowball '' climate state ; and @xmath19 is the temperature at which the planet transitions between the two climate states .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : albedo ] ) assumes a step - wise transition in albedo , which neglects the effects of spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it allows us to make easier analytical progress and does not alter the qualitative behavior of the system unless multiple snowball - like climate states possible @xcite , which is a possibility we will not consider here . as we will see below , introducing a smoothed albedo transition only introduces a repulsing fixed point in some situations that the climate could not exist stably in . finally , if we assume that the reference climate state is warm , then @xmath20 .",
    "the partial pressure of co@xmath0 is determined by outgassing and weathering @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the co@xmath0 outgassing rate , @xmath23 is the rate of removal of co@xmath0 from the atmosphere by silicate weathering in the reference climate state , @xmath24 is a rate constant for the increase in weathering with temperature , and @xmath25 is an exponent that determines how strongly weathering depends on atmospheric co@xmath0 partial pressure . @xcite used an analysis of river catchments to estimate that @xmath26  @xmath12c@xmath13 ( 1-@xmath27 error ) .",
    "based on that study , the plausible range for @xmath24 is roughly 00.2 .",
    "i will use a standard value of @xmath24=0.1 and vary @xmath24 over this range .",
    "@xmath25 could be zero if land plants concentrate co@xmath0 in the soil at the same level regardless of the atmospheric co@xmath0 concentration @xcite , and theoretical arguments suggest @xmath25 has a maximum of 1 @xcite .",
    "i will use a standard value of @xmath25=0.5 @xcite , but consider variations within the plausible range .",
    "depressurization caused by glacial unloading can cause temporary increases in the co@xmath0 outgassing rate @xcite .",
    "i neglect this affect and take the co@xmath0 outgassing rate to be independent climate state here , which is appropriate for longterm average behavior .",
    "note also that in section  [ sec : cycles ] we will consider @xmath23=0 when @xmath28 .    for the purposes of this paper",
    "i am assuming that weathering follows a similar parameterization on land and at the seafloor , but it should be understood that the weathering behavior of an ocean planet would likely be quite different from that of a planet with an earth - like land fraction @xcite .",
    "the weathering parameterization in equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) is similar to that used by other authors @xcite , but i have dropped the relatively weak dependence on temperature that is often included to represent changes in precipitation with temperature .",
    "the qualitative behavior of weathering as a function of temperature is captured by equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) without this additional complication .",
    "given the ad hoc nature of all weathering parameterizations , it is reasonable to choose the simplest parameterization that gives the expected qualitative behavior of weathering processes given the objectives of this paper .    equations  ( [ eq : climate_model])-([eq : co2_bal ] ) define the system .",
    "the plan for analyzing them is as follows .",
    "first we will consider the warm ( habitable ) state ( section [ sec : warm ] ) .",
    "i will set the albedo ( equation  ( [ eq : albedo ] ) ) to its warm state value , set the time derivatives in equations  ( [ eq : climate_model ] ) and ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) to zero , and solve the system for conditions when the temperature is high enough for the warm state to exist .",
    "this will allow us to put bounds on the existence of the warm state , that is , define an effective outer edge of the habitable zone that may be more restrictive than the traditional outer edge .",
    "next i will find nullclines of the system defined by equations  ( [ eq : climate_model ] ) and ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) ( that is , lines where the time derivatives equal zero ) , find their intersections ( fixed points , or solutions of the system ) , and determine the stability of these fixed points .",
    "physically , this will reveal that if equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) is followed as is , enough weathering occurs that the system settles into a stable snowball state when the warm climate state ceases to exist , rather than into climate cycles between snowball and warm conditions .",
    "i will then show that climate cycles do occur if we set weathering to zero in the snowball state in equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) ( section  [ sec : cycles ] ) .",
    "i will find analytical solutions for the components of these cycles and derive an analytical formula for their period that can predict well results from the more intricate model of @xcite .",
    "i will then discuss these results in section  [ sec : discussion ] and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    ".a list of the model parameters , their descriptions , and the standard values i use for them .",
    "the parameter values in this table are taken from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "note that , following @xcite , i use a value of @xmath23 ten times higher than @xcite .",
    "i perform sensitivity analyses where i vary @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "in this section we will consider the conditions that allow the carbon cycle to maintain a planet in the warm climate state , which is necessary for the planet to be considered habitable in the traditional sense .",
    "this requires a steady - state solution , so we can set the time derivatives in equations  ( [ eq : climate_model ] ) and ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) to zero .",
    "we can solve this system to find @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the warm state temperature .",
    "we could rewrite equation  ( [ eq : t_w ] ) in non - dimensional form , but i will leave it , and subsequent equations , in dimensionful form to make them more accessible physically . from equation  ( [ eq : t_w ] ) we can see that increasing the co@xmath0 outgassing rate logarithmically increases the warm state temperature , and that increased outgassing warms the warm state more if the climate is more sensitive to co@xmath0 ( higher @xmath3 ) , provided @xmath31 .",
    "we can also see that the influence of stellar flux on the warm state temperature depends on @xmath25 , the weathering - co@xmath0 power - law exponent . if @xmath32 , then changing the stellar flux has no effect on the warm state temperature as long as the stellar flux is high enough that @xmath33 , so that the warm state can exist .",
    "instead , the warm state temperature is determined by the outgassing rate . as @xmath25 increases",
    ", the warm climate state becomes increasingly sensitive to changes in stellar flux .",
    "we can solve for the warm state co@xmath0 partial pressure ( @xmath34 ) as follows @xmath35 the warm state co@xmath0 partial pressure has a power law dependence on the co@xmath0 outgassing rate .",
    "the exponent depends most strongly on @xmath2 , which determines the increase in outgoing longwave radiation with temperature .",
    "the more that increasing the warm state temperature by a given amount increases longwave cooling , the higher the warm state co@xmath0 must be to maintain that temperature at a given co@xmath0 outgassing rate . as expected , the warm state co@xmath0 partial pressure is exponentially lower if the stellar flux is higher .",
    "this effect is mediated mainly by @xmath24 , the parameter that determines the increase in weathering with temperature .",
    "if @xmath24 is higher , then a given warming from an increase in stellar flux causes the weathering to increase more , and draws down the co@xmath0 more .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : t_w ] ) , we can solve for the coldest possible warm state by setting @xmath36 .",
    "this is a very important condition because habitability would be lost if anything were to cool the climate when it is in the coldest possible warm state .",
    "we can solve for the stellar flux at which the coldest possible warm state exists ( @xmath37 ) , which we can think as the effective outer edge of the habitable zone , as follows @xmath38 a lower value of @xmath37 means that the stellar flux must be decreased more to reach the coldest possible warm state , which means that the warm climate state exists in more of the habitable zone .",
    "the ideal situation for habitability is when @xmath37 is decreased enough that it is smaller than the outer edge of the habitable zone , the point at which some other process , such as rayleigh scattering , prevents co@xmath0 from warming the planetary surface . if this is the case then the silicate - weathering feedback can keep a planet habitable throughout the entire habitable zone .",
    "the first thing we can note from equation  ( [ eq : s_star ] ) is that if the albedo of the warm state is smaller , the effective outer edge of the habitable zone will be further out .",
    "since absorption of stellar flux by atmospheric water vapor should be larger for planets orbiting smaller , redder stars @xcite , the effective outer edge of the habitable zone is less likely to restrict the traditional habitable zone for m - stars than for g - stars and more likely for f - stars , which is consistent with what has been recently found by @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : s_star ] ) also tells us that the effective outer edge of the habitable zone depends only logarithmically on the co@xmath0 outgassing rate .",
    "this is important because it tells us that large changes in the co@xmath0 outgassing rate are necessary to significantly change the effective outer edge .",
    "for example , increasing the co@xmath0 outgassing rate by a factor of ten only decreases the effective outer edge from 794  w  m@xmath11 to 530  w  m@xmath11 , for our standard parameters ( figure  [ fig : outer_outgassing2 ] ) .",
    "changing the weathering parameters can have a much larger effect , which we can investigate by doing a sensitivity analysis in which we vary them .",
    "for example , either increasing the weathering - temperature rate constant ( @xmath24 ) by a factor of two or decreasing the weathering - co@xmath0 power law exponent ( @xmath25 ) by a factor of two causes a similar reduction in the effective outer edge as increasing the co@xmath0 outgassing by a factor of ten ( figure  [ fig : outer_outgassing2 ] ) .    changing @xmath24 and changing @xmath25 have qualitatively different effects on the response of @xmath37 to changes in the co@xmath0 outgassing rate ( figure  [ fig : outer_outgassing2 ] ) . decreasing @xmath25 increases the slope of @xmath37 as a function of @xmath39 , which means that increasing the co@xmath0 outgassing rate by a given amount extends the effective habitable zone further ( equation  ( [ eq : s_star ] ) ) .",
    "this is because the temperature becomes more sensitive to the co@xmath0 outgassing rate when @xmath25 is smaller ( equation  ( [ eq : t_w ] ) ) . alternatively , changing @xmath24 changes the offset of the @xmath37 versus @xmath39 line , but not the slope .",
    "a higher value of @xmath24 means that the temperature has to change less to cause the same change in weathering rate .",
    "this allows the stellar flux to be dropped to a lower value before the warm state temperature reaches the temperature at which the warm state is lost ( @xmath36 ) .    for reference",
    "i have plotted the estimated positions of modern earth , earth 3.8  gyr ago , and mars 3.8  gyr on figure  [ fig : outer_outgassing2 ] .",
    "the simple model used here indicates that early and modern earth are safely inside the effective outer edge of the habitable zone , whereas early mars would have been beyond the effective outer edge of the habitable zone even if it were within the traditional habitable zone .",
    "this is consistent with the histories of the two planets if we assume that fluvial features on early mars were episodic @xcite .",
    "that said , it should be understood that specific conclusions like these depend on details of weathering parameterizations , and the purpose of this paper is to expose the qualitative effects of weathering , rather than to try to answer detailed questions .",
    "another way we can think about this is to consider the set of weathering parameters that would make the effective outer edge of the habitable zone correspond to the traditional outer edge of the habitable zone .",
    "if we denote the traditional outer edge of the habitable zone as @xmath40 , we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq : s_star ] ) as @xmath41 equation  ( [ eq : outer_edge ] ) represents a series of lines of @xmath24 as a function of @xmath25 for different values of the co@xmath0 outgassing rate .",
    "if @xmath24 is larger or @xmath25 is smaller than the line for a particular co@xmath0 outgassing rate , then the effective habitable zone is just as large as the traditional habitable zone for this co@xmath0 outgassing rate .",
    "figure  [ fig : outer_outgassing ] shows three such curves for different co@xmath0 outgassing rates . for the default values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , some of the habitable zone would be lost even if the co@xmath0 outgassing rate were ten times higher than modern earth s",
    "( @xmath42 would be required for the effective outer edge to equal the traditional outer edge ) . however , relatively small changes to @xmath24 , @xmath25 , or some combination of the two can save the habitable zone even for modern earth s co@xmath0 outgassing rate ( figure  [ fig : outer_outgassing ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are uncertain and may vary between planets , but the expressions in this section could be used for a probabilistic estimate of planetary habitability if appropriate priors are used for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if the stellar flux or co@xmath0 outgassing rate is lowered enough that the warm climate state no longer exists , the planet enters a snowball state and the albedo increases according to equation  ( [ eq : albedo ] ) .",
    "it is an open question how weathering would behave in a snowball state .",
    "@xcite assumed that weathering would go to zero due to lack of rain ( liquid water ) , and we will consider this case in section  [ sec : cycles ] .",
    "the possibility remains , however , that weathering could continue to occur under wet - based ice sheets or at the seafloor @xcite .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we will continue to use equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) to characterize weathering in the snowball state , but it should be understood that either subglacial or seafloor weathering could lead to different parameterizations .",
    "as we will see , however , the important point is that if some co@xmath0-dependent weathering can occur in the snowball state , and it causes weathering to increase enough to balance co@xmath0 outgassing before the snowball deglaciates , then it is possible for this state to be a stable solution of the system .",
    "we can solve for the temperature tendency nullcline ( the line on which @xmath43=0 in equation  ( [ eq : climate_model ] ) ) , which results in @xmath44 equation  ( [ eq : t_nullcline ] ) describes two lines of @xmath45 as a function of @xmath46 , each with a slope of @xmath47 .",
    "the colder solution has a larger vertical offset .",
    "this is because more co@xmath0 would be required to keep the cold state at a given temperature than the warm state because the albedo is higher in the cold state ( although they can never actually exist at the same temperature ) .",
    "similarly , we solve for the co@xmath0 partial pressure tendency nullcline ( the line on which @xmath48=0 in equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) ) to find @xmath49 equation  ( [ eq : p_nullcline ] ) describes a line of @xmath45 as a function of @xmath46 with a slope of @xmath50 .",
    "since the slope is negative , there will always be at least one intersection of the two nullclines , which will be a steady - state of the system .",
    "as the co@xmath0 outgassing rate ( @xmath22 ) increases , the intercept of equation  ( [ eq : p_nullcline ] ) is increased and the solution becomes warmer . for high values of @xmath22 only the warm state is a steady state , and for low values only the cold state is a steady state . for intermediate values of @xmath22",
    "it is possible to have both states to be a steady state of the system .",
    "we already solved for the warm state temperature and co@xmath0 in equations  ( [ eq : t_w ] ) and ( [ eq : p_w ] ) .",
    "we can now solve for the cold state temperature ( @xmath51 ) and co@xmath0 ( @xmath52 ) using the cold branch of equation  ( [ eq : t_nullcline ] ) @xmath53    the final point of interest is to determine the stability of the fixed points described by equations  ( [ eq : t_w ] ) , ( [ eq : p_w ] ) , ( [ eq : t_c ] ) , and ( [ eq : p_c ] ) .",
    "we can do this by evaluating the jacobian ( @xmath54 ) of the system at the fixed points @xmath55 for both the warm and cold states , the trace of the jacobian ( @xmath56 ) is less than zero and its determinant ( @xmath57 ) is greater than zero .",
    "this means that the warm and cold states are always attracting @xcite .",
    "@xmath58 is generally positive , which means that the fixed points will usually be stable nodes , although it is possible for them to be stable spirals for some parameter combinations .",
    "i have plotted what we have learned about the nullclines and their intersections for a representative set of parameters in figure  [ fig : nullclines ] .",
    "this plot shows how intersections of the nullclines lead to steady states , and how at least one intersection will always occur since the co@xmath0 partial pressure tendency nullcline has a negative slope and the two temperature tendency nullclines have a positive slope .",
    "note that although the simplicity of the model we are considering constrains the nullclines to be linear , we would expect similar , but potentially nonlinear , behavior from a more complicated model .",
    "for example , if we used a more sophisticated radiative transfer model for the climate calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it would lead to curvature in the temperature tendency nullclines , but no change in the topology of the system .    because we have assumed a discontinous albedo transition ( equation  ( [ eq : albedo ] ) ) stable fixed points appear and disappear in isolation in figure  [ fig : nullclines ] .",
    "if we had instead assumed a smoothed albedo transition , for example smoothed with a hyperbolic tangent function , the two temperature tendency nullclines would smoothly join together . in this case",
    ", there would always be an unstable saddle fixed point between the two attracting fixed points representing the warm and snowball climate states when both attracting states exist at the same co@xmath0 outgassing rate .",
    "if the co@xmath0 outgassing rate were changed sufficiently , the saddle fixed point would merge with either of the attracting fixed points in a saddle node bifurcation , rather than the attracting fixed point just disappearing as it does in the discontinous albedo system .",
    "alternatively , we can consider the situation where the weathering rate is smaller than the co@xmath0 outgassing rate for temperatures less than the temperature at which the planet transitions between the two climate states ( @xmath28 ) . for simplicity , i will set the weathering rate to zero for @xmath28 , following @xcite . in this case",
    "no snowball steady state is possible because there is no weathering term to balance co@xmath0 outgassing when the planet is experiencing a snowball ( equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) ) .",
    "instead co@xmath0 simply accumulates in the snowball state , warming it , until the temperature @xmath19 is reached .",
    "this causes the albedo to decrease ( physically the ice melts ) and the planet abruptly jumps into the warm climate state . if we assume that the co@xmath0 outgassing rate is low enough that no warm climate steady state exists , then the warm climate leads to the rapid removal of co@xmath0 by weathering until @xmath19 is again reached , then the climate abruptly jumps into the snowball state , and the cycle repeats",
    ". figure  [ fig : cycles ] shows a diagram of this cycle in phase space and figure  [ fig : cycles2 ] shows timeseries of co@xmath0 partial pressure and temperature through the cycle .",
    "the two transitions between the snowball and warm states occur on the timescale of relaxation back to the temperature tendency nullcline .",
    "this timescale is given by @xmath59 years , which is essentially instantaneous for our purposes ( the system is extremely stiff ) .",
    "this allows us to make the approximation that as the co@xmath0 changes in either the warm or snowball state , the climate exists along the temperature tendency nullcline ( @xmath43=0 in equation  ( [ eq : climate_model ] ) ) .",
    "the co@xmath0 partial pressure in the warm state ( @xmath60 ) as a function of the temperature in the warm state ( @xmath61 ) is therefore @xmath62 and the co@xmath0 partial pressure in the cold state ( @xmath63 ) as a function of the temperature in the cold state ( @xmath64 ) is @xmath65 i have used a tilde for the co@xmath0 partial pressure and temperature variables in these equations because they are not true solutions of the system , since weathering never balances co@xmath0 outgassing during the cycles .",
    "@xmath48 is constant during the snowball phase if the weathering rate is zero ( equal to @xmath22 ) , so it is easy to calculate the time spent in the snowball phase ( @xmath66 ) as @xmath67 where we have used the fact that in general @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , if we assume that silicate weathering is limited by the supply of silicate cations from erosion @xcite , then we can approximate the weathering rate as a constant during the warm phase . using similar logic as we used to get equation  ( [ eq : snow_time ] ) , we arrive at a first estimate for the time spent in the warm state ( @xmath69 ) of @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the factor by which the supply - limited maximum weathering rate exceeds modern earth s weathering rate ( @xmath722.5 is a good guess for an earth - like planet , * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath73 is the fractional reduction in warm state relative to cold state lifetime due to the fact that the weathering is higher in the warm state . using @xmath23=20@xmath22 , as in figure  [ fig : cycles ] , we get @xmath73=@xmath74 .",
    "this would indicate that a negligible amount of the time in the cycle is spent in the warm state relative to the cold state .",
    "it is more difficult to calculate the time spent in the warm climate state if we let @xmath48 vary .",
    "substituting into equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) we find the following differential equation for the co@xmath0 partial pressure in the warm state ( @xmath60 ) @xmath75 equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal2 ] ) has a simple analytical solution for @xmath76=1 , which happens to be the case for our default parameters ( table  [ tab : params ] ) .",
    "i will use this limit to illustrate the behavior of the warm state co@xmath0 drawdown .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath77 , so that equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal2 ] ) is solved by @xmath78 we are seeking the time , @xmath79 , such that @xmath80 , so plugging into equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal2_soln ] ) we find @xmath81 in general @xmath82 , as we would expect because the temperatures are high and the weathering is fast in the warm state ( leading to a low @xmath83 ) and we limit the weathering rate in our other warm state timescale estimate ( @xmath69 ) . for example , for the parameters used in figure  ( [ fig : cycles ] ) ,",
    "@xmath66=250  myr ( slow ) , the two estimates for the time spent in the warm state are @xmath69=5  myr and @xmath83=0.5  myr ( fast ) , and the time to transition between the warm and snowball states ( @xmath84 ) is about 3 years ( very fast ) .",
    "since the other components of the cycle take are short , @xmath66 ( equation  ( [ eq : snow_time ] ) ) yields a good approximation of the period of the total cycle , which we will call @xmath56 .",
    "we can drop the constants associated with the reference state in equation  ( [ eq : snow_time ] ) as follows to think about the variable dependencies of @xmath56 @xmath85 as one might expect , the period of the cycles is inversely proportional to the co@xmath0 outgassing rate .",
    "the more interesting aspect of equation  ( [ eq : snow_time2 ] ) is that it gives us a functional form for the dependence of the period of the cycle on the stellar flux and albedo of the cold state .",
    "if we start in the warm state and decrease the stellar flux ( say by moving the planet away from the star ) , a limit cycle will suddenly appear when the threshold for existence of the warm state is crossed ( equation  ( [ eq : s_star ] ) ) .",
    "if we continue to decrease the stellar flux , the period of this cycle will grow exponentially as the stellar flux is decreased .",
    "the exponential functional dependence ultimately derives from the logarithmic effect of co@xmath0 on infrared emission to space ( equation  ( [ eq : climate_model ] ) ) .",
    "this means that the period of the cycle for planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone will be very long , so the difference between having a permanent snowball state as in section  [ sec : stable_snow ] and having very slow cycles through the snowball and warm states as described in this section will be marginal",
    ". similarly , the timescales will be exponentially shorter as we decrease the snowball albedo .",
    "since ice and snow have a much lower albedo for an m - star spectrum @xcite , this implies that the climate cycles for planets in m - star systems would have much shorter periods .",
    "finally , increasing @xmath3 decreases the effect of changing the stellar flux and snowball albedo .",
    "it is important to note that since we have set the weathering rate to zero in the snowball , which is the part of the cycle that determines its period , none of the uncertain weathering parameters affect the period of the cycle .",
    "the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath19 ( equation  ( [ eq : snow_time2 ] ) can significantly affect the comparison of different models .",
    "for example , i implemented a smoothed version of the albedo transition ( equation  ( [ eq : albedo ] ) ) and integrated the system numerically .",
    "i found that the period of the cycle was strongly dependent on the temperature smoothing of the albedo parameterization because this affected the effective temperature at which the transition from the snowball to the warm climate occurred .",
    "using @xmath86 , a decrease in @xmath19 by about 10  k leads to a decrease in @xmath56 by about an order of magnitude .",
    "this sensitivity will affect the comparison of cycle periods between models , however , the dependencies shown in equation  ( [ eq : snow_time2 ] ) should hold within a given model .",
    "we can use equation  ( [ eq : snow_time2 ] ) to understand simulations in more complex models .",
    "for example , @xcite performed six different simulations of climate cycles for planets at different orbital distances ( corresponding to different stellar fluxes ) , co@xmath0 outgassing rates , and values of @xmath25 .",
    "two of these simulations have a co@xmath0 outgassing rate three times higher than the others , and , according to equation  ( [ eq : snow_time2 ] ) , i have adjusted their period by multiplying it by three .",
    "i have plotted the logarithm of the adjusted period as a function of stellar flux in figure  [ fig : menou ] .",
    "i have also plotted the time spent in the snowball state for each simulation , which we can calculate because @xcite gives the percentage of the cycle spent in the warm state .",
    "the first thing to note is that the logarithm of the period is fairly linear in stellar flux , consistent with equation  ( [ eq : snow_time2 ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the snowball albedo is 0.7 , the slope of the line corresponds to a value of @xmath3 of about 27  w  m@xmath11 , which is the right order of magnitude .",
    "two of the simulations have periods 1020% longer than expected .",
    "these simulations have a lower value of @xmath25 , and therefore spend a higher fraction of their cycle in the warm state @xcite .",
    "we should also note that even the time spent in the snowball state does not fall exactly on a straight line , and it is not a single - valued function of stellar flux .",
    "the reasons for this are : ( 1 ) @xcite uses a much more complex radiation model in which infrared emission to space is not simply a linear function of the logarithm of co@xmath0 , ( 2 ) @xcite calculates the snowball albedo including the effect of the amount of co@xmath0 , so it is not a constant , and ( 3 ) the weathering parameterization that @xcite uses allows some weathering for temperatures slightly below the snowball deglaciation temperature threshold , which can delay the deglaciation and causes different results for different values of @xmath25 . despite these differences ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : snow_time2 ] ) does an excellent job of describing the qualitative behavior of period of the cycles from the simulations of @xcite .",
    "a major advance of this paper is to derive an explicit formula for the effective outer edge of the habitable zone ( equation [ eq : s_star ] ) .",
    "although the weathering parameters in this formula are uncertain , it could be incorporated into future probabilistic estimates of habitability of discovered exoplanets , with appropriate prior distributions placed on weathering parameters . once a planet is beyond this limit , i have found that it will either experience a permanent snowball state or long cycles between a snowball and warm climate , depending on whether weathering goes completely to zero during the snowball or note . either way the habitability of the planet would be greatly reduced .",
    "also , the fact that the snowball episodes earth has experienced did end does not imply that the weathering was zero during them @xcite , since the stellar flux was relatively high during these episodes .",
    "@xcite found that the outer edge of the traditional habitable zone has only a small dependence on planet size , but the effective outer edge of the habitable zone could strongly depend on planet size .",
    "a larger planet will tend to have a higher rate of volcanism , and presumably co@xmath0 outgassing , yet it will also have a larger overburden pressure for a given volatile inventory @xcite . these competing effects will determine how planetary size affects co@xmath0 outgassing rate , and consequently susceptibility to loss of the warm climate state inside the traditional habitable zone .",
    "moreover , the co@xmath0 outgassing rate should decrease strongly with time @xcite , which indicates that planets near the outer edge of the traditional habitable zone are more likely to actually be habitable in younger systems .",
    "the albedo and thermal phase curve of an earth - like planet could be interrogated to determine whether it was in a snowball or warm climate state @xcite .",
    "this might be possible for a planet near the outer edge of the habitable zone with the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "@xcite , and would certainly be possible with a future mission such as the _ high definition space telescope _",
    "new geochronological data @xcite suggest that the sturtian and marinoan snowball earth episodes had a combined duration of about 80  myr , which is about 10% of the time since they occurred , implying that a roughly 10% snowball duty cycle could be realistic for an earth - like planet .",
    "planets near the outer edge of the traditional habitable zone that have a stable warm state but are perturbed away from it and into a snowball could take longer to warm up via co@xmath0 outgassing and will therefore spend a somewhat higher percentage of their time as a snowball .",
    "if these planets are anything like earth , however , they should still spend the vast majority of their time in the warm climate state .",
    "planets outside the effective outer edge of the habitable zone , on the other hand , should spend most of their time as a snowball . therefore a measurement of the fraction of earth - like planets in a warm state as a function of position in the habitable zone would tell us whether co@xmath0-outgassing limitations on the habitable zone are important .",
    "a large increase in the average number of earth - like planets in a snowball state near the outer edge of the habitable zone would indicate that co@xmath0-outgassing limitations are important on average . in this way",
    "astronomical measurements could increase our understanding of weathering . similarly , continued study of river catchments , paleoclimate , and laboratory weathering analogs should help improve our understanding of weathering , and therefore the effective outer edge of the habitable zone , which will inform the astronomical search for habitable exoplanets .",
    "in this paper i have not included the effect of co@xmath0 on planetary albedo .",
    "this means that if the weathering is set to zero in a snowball state , then the co@xmath0 can always build up to high enough values to cause deglaciation and lead to climate cycles if the warm state does not exist ( section [ sec : cycles ] ) . for snowball states that require tens of bars of co@xmath0 to deglaciate ,",
    "increased shortwave scattering by co@xmath0 could prevent deglaciation from ever occurring .",
    "if this were the case , the snowball state could be stable even if the co@xmath0 cycle is not balanced .",
    "if deglaciaton does occur at a very high co@xmath0 level , then the atmospheric albedo might be so high that the change in surface albedo has a minimal effect on the planetary albedo @xcite , so the warming associated with deglaciation is minimal . in this case co@xmath0",
    "could still be drawn down due to high co@xmath0 concentrations ( equation  ( [ eq : co2_bal ] ) ) , leading to a climate cycle , but the planet would likely spend more time in the warm state .    finally , we should note that even if the effective outer edge of the habitable zone occurs at a significantly higher stellar flux than the traditional outer edge , there should still be plenty of habitats for life in the universe . if the habitable zone were cut in half , the proportion of sun - like stars hosting earth - like potentially habitable planets would go from @xmath725% to @xmath722.5% @xcite , which might have been considered an optimistic estimate before the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "moreover , recent work on h@xmath0-greenhouse planets suggests that habitable planets can exist even outside of the traditional habitable zone @xcite .",
    "additionally , life , and maybe even animal life , seems to have survived the snowball earth episodes , and could potentially survive permanent or cyclical snowball climates near the outer edge of the habitable zone , although such conditions would certainly be less favorable to complex life than modern earth . finally , if simple life can exist in subglacial oceans on distant or unbound earth - like planets @xcite , then the snowball planets beyond the effective habitable zone would still be viable hosts for some sort of life .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper are :    1",
    ".   the stellar flux at the effective outer edge of the habitable zone can be approximated by the following formula : @xmath87 larger values of @xmath24 , the weathering - temperature rate constant , linearly decrease the stellar flux of the effective outer edge of the habitable zone , moving it farther from the star and providing more habitable space in the system .",
    "smaller values of @xmath25 , the weathering - co@xmath0 power law exponent , directly decrease the stellar flux of the effective outer edge of the habitable zone and also leverage the effect of increases in the co@xmath0 outgassing rate .",
    "if @xmath24 is increased by about a factor of two or @xmath25 is decreased by a factor of two , or some smaller combination of the two , then the effective outer edge of the habitable zone equals the traditional outer edge of the habitable zone even for modern earth s co@xmath0 outgassing rate , and none of the habitable zone would be lost .",
    "these changes are within the uncertainty in the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this equation also tells us that m - star planets should tend to have less of a reduction in their habitable zone due to limited co@xmath0 outgassing , since @xmath17 , the warm state albedo , will tend to be smaller for m - star planets ( making @xmath37 smaller ) .",
    "+ the formula for @xmath37 could be incorporated into probabilistic estimates of whether a discovered exoplanet is habitable , using appropriate priors on @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it could similarly be used to estimate the fraction of stars that host an earth - like planet given statistics of exoplanet occurrences .",
    "both of these uses would aid in the planning of telescopes that would observe earth - like planets and search for biosignatures .",
    "2 .   beyond the effective outer edge of the habitable zone ( but inside the traditional outer edge )",
    "cycles between a snowball and warm climate are possible if weathering is weak enough that the co@xmath0 needed to deglaciate a snowball is reached before weathering can balance co@xmath0 outgassing ( for example if the weathering rate is simply set to zero in a snowball climate ) . if weathering occurs either subglacially or at the seafloor , it is possible to have a stable , attracting snowball climate state .",
    "if climate cycles between a snowball and warm state occur , then the period of these cycles scales as @xmath88 this formula comes from the time spent in the snowball state , which dominates the total period and can be calculated by dividing the co@xmath0 needed to deglaciate the snowabll by the co@xmath0 outgassing rate ( which explains why the period of the cycles is inversely proportional to the co@xmath0 outgassing rate ) . the exponential dependence on the temperature at which the snowball state deglaciates and the negative exponential dependence on the stellar flux ultimately derive from the fact that co@xmath0 has a logarithmic effect on infrared emission to space and the greenhouse warming of a planet . the negative exponential dependence on stellar flux indicates that cycles near the outer edge of the habitable zone will have very long periods , and may be hard to distinguish from permanent snowball states .",
    "the exponential dependence on the planetary albedo of the cold state indicates that climate cycles will have a shorter period for planets orbiting m - stars because the albedo of ice and snow is lower for an m - star spectrum .",
    "finally , it is important to note that none of the uncertain weathering parameters appear in this scaling .",
