    "the threshold between the classical and quantum world has fascinated physicists since the discovery of quantum phenomena and realizing how different they are from our everyday experience .",
    "one of the prominent examples of quantum behavior is the nonlocality leading to violation of bell s inequalities @xcite . for two - level systems",
    "there is no nonlocality without quantum entanglement , but the opposite can be true @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement plays an important role in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "however , the entanglement is not the only type of non - classical correlations . as described by ollivier and zurek @xcite",
    "the nonclassical correlations can be associated with _",
    "quantum discord_. quantum discord ( qd ) is useful in many ways including quantum information processing or detection of quantum phase transitions , especially in the cases when the entanglement fails to grasp this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was demonstrated that only classical correlations can be broadcast locally @xcite .",
    "all of these features of quantum discord motivate the quest for developing tools for detecting and quantifying it .",
    "nevertheless , there were only a few experimental implementations of witnesses of nonclassical correlations , or _",
    "nonclassicality witnesses _ ( nws ) , in discrete - variable systems .",
    "two of them were implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance systems @xcite and one using linear optics @xcite , however these witnesses were not universal . at this point",
    ", we should stress that detecting purely classical correlations is a difficult problem since it involves solving optimization problem over a nonconvex set of classical states .",
    "thus , the problem of detecting classical correlations is harder that detection of entanglement .",
    "moreover , any nw should be nonlinear @xcite .",
    "for those reasons the nws @xcite are usually non - universal . however , zhang @xcite demonstrated that finding a universal nw is possible , but the established witness is not suitable for optical implementation . a better suited qd indicator ( qdi ) which overcomes the limitations of all the previously developed witnesses is a measure introduced by girolami and adesso @xcite .",
    "we call it an indicator instead of a witness since in contrast to a typical witness it is universal and on average its value provides a bound on qd .",
    "let us start with introducing some basic definitions used throughout our paper .",

    "the state @xmath0 is not entangled ( is separable ) when it has a positive partial transpose , i.e. , is a ppt state ( see peres - horodecki criterion @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of entanglement for a two - qubit system implies , e.g. , locality , in terms of violation of the bell - chsh inequality @xcite ( for quantitative study see @xcite ) , and thus it corresponds to classical situation where the measurement outcomes can be explained by a hidden - variable model . however , quantum entanglement is not responsible for all the nonclassical effects .",
    "one of the recently celebrated manifestation of quantumness is _ quantum discord _ @xcite .",
    "the qd is responsible for the difference in conditional quantum information calculated in two ways , where one of them uses the bayesian rule for calculating probabilities .",
    "therefore , qd quantifies how much conditional quantum probabilities differ from those calculated within classical theory .",
    "the qd vanishes if the state fulfills the strong ppt condition @xcite , i.e. , @xmath0 has to be ppt and its ppt must admit cholesky decomposition ( there are also other so - called nullity conditions  for review see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if there is no discord , there is no entanglement .",
    "however , the reverse does not have to be true .",
    "there are several ways of quantifying qd .",
    "the one for which an analytic formula is known @xcite is the so - called _ geometric quantum discord _ ( gqd ) quantifying hilbert - schmidt distance to the closest non - discordant state .",
    "the expression for the gqd reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 ) stand for eigenvalues of matrix @xmath14 or @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes transposition .",
    "the largest @xmath12 is denoted as @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath18 is asymmetric .",
    "thus , if @xmath19 the state is called classical quantum or if @xmath20 the state is quantum - classical .",
    "naturally , there have been attempts of finding an analytic formula for the symmetric gqd , which answers the question about the closest classical - classical state , however this is still an open problem @xcite .    if @xmath21 the state is classical - classical since it does not exhibit quantum correlations responsible for discord between conditional quantum information calculated in the two above - mentioned ways . in the following sections we show how to experimentally identify states of zero @xmath18 and",
    "describe how to perform the experiment within the framework of linear - optics by measuring @xmath22 introduced in in ref .",

    "our approach is less complex than full qt , since it only requires two measurements , if four copies of @xmath0 are available [ either spatially ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) or time separated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) ] , instead of 16 for the qt @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the proposed measurement setup is expected to be faster than the direct qt , since it would provide the outcome within a minute .",
    "let us note that if the one had access to six copies of @xmath0 , the qid could be estimated in a single measurement in contrast to the simpler experiment described in @xcite , where the nw was not universal and its estimation involved measuring three quantities .",
    "our approach can be extended ( by using larger number of copies ) to directly measure gqd as discussed in ref .",
    "moreover , our results can help to establish discord related nws based on matrices of moments for optical fields ( studied previously in the context of entanglement  @xcite and other nonclassical phenomena  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , let us note that the discussed setup can measure moments @xmath121 and @xmath122 which can constitute other qdis or nws ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , thus it can be used for investigating various quantum properties of light in a way that was previously available only for the nmr platform .",
