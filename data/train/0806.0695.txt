    "the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) is one of the largest ground - based astronomy projects of the next decade , which will revolutionize several fields of astronomy . a large community of scientists",
    "is expected to use alma to tackle several outstanding questions in astrophysics .",
    "however , mm / submm astronomy is often considered a field restricted to experts . in the case of students and young scientists in particular ,",
    "the limited familiarity with mm / submm facilities and observations may prevent them to fully exploit the alma capabilities in the future .",
    "these lecture notes are aimed at providing students and young researches some background on mm / submm extragalactic astronomy , with a focus on the investigation of agns .",
    "i will first provide a quick overview of the current results obtained through extragalactic mm / submm observations , by focusing on agns (  [ sec_mm_astronomy ] ) .",
    "i will then summarize the currently available ( and forthcoming ) mm - submm facilities (  [ sec_current_facilities ] ) . then i will shortly describe alma and summarize its observing capabilities (  [ sec_alma ] ) .",
    "finally , i will discuss some of the alma prospects for extragalactic studies , and in particular for agns , both in the local universe and at cosmological distances (  [ sec_alma_prospects ] ) .",
    "these lecture notes are far from being exhaustive ; several scientific cases will not be discussed at all ; the main goal of these notes is only to provide an introduction to mm / submm extragalactic astronomy and to highlight some scientific cases that alma will be able to tackle .",
    "this branch of astronomy includes observations at wavelengths between @xmath010  mm and @xmath0300  @xmath1 m .",
    "longer wavelengths are traditionally identified as radio - astronomy domain .",
    "shorter wavelengths , out to mid - ir wavelengths , are unobservable from ground because of the nearly complete atmospheric absorption ( although some sites , under exceptional conditions , allow observations out to @xmath2 m . ) . even within the mm - submm range not all wavelengths are equally easy to observe , since the sky transparency on average decreases rapidly at shorter wavelengths . at @xmath3",
    "only a few atmospheric windows are accessible , and only under optimal weather conditions .",
    "this issue is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_atm_transmission ] , which shows the atmospheric transmission at the alma site .",
    "the main source of opacity at these wavelengths is the water vapor .",
    "this is the reason for locating mm - submm observatories at dry and high altitude sites , where the amount of water vapor is much reduced .",
    "however , even at these optimal sites there are strong variations of the the water vapor , which make the atmospheric transmission change strongly ( fig .  [ fig_atm_transmission ] ) both on long ( seasonal ) and short ( day / night ) time scales .    given the difficulties of observing at these wavelengths",
    "one may wonder why international agencies are investing so much effort to develop facilities with enhanced observing capabilities in these bands .",
    "the mm - submm band contains a wealth of information that can not be inferred from any other band .",
    "most of the @xmath0150 molecules known so far in the _ cold _ interstellar medium ( see http://astrochemistry.net for an updated list ) emit their rotational transitions in the mm - submm bands , with a density of about 70  lines / ghz .",
    "all of these transitions are important diagnostics of the chemistry , of the physics and of the dynamics of the inter stellar medium ( ism ) from which stars form .",
    "some of these lines are so strong ( e.g. the co transitions ) to be powerful tools to trace the dynamics and the gas physics even in distant galaxies .",
    "furthermore , some of the strongest lines emitted by the ism of any galaxy , such as the [ cii]158@xmath1 m and the [ oi]63@xmath1 m fine structure lines ( the two main coolants of the ism ) , are redshifted into the mm - submm bands at z@xmath424 .    within the context of the continuum emission ,",
    "the mm - submm bands encompass the rayleigh - jeans region of the warm dust thermal emission ( which traces star formation and the dust mass ) , the high frequency tail of the synchrotron emission ( dominating the radio emission in most galaxies ) and of the free - free emission ( tracing hii regions ) . at high redshift",
    "the prominent ir dust thermal bump ( which dominates the spectral energy distribution sed in starburst galaxies ) is shifted into the submm band , therefore making this one of the best spectral regions to search and characterize high - z star forming galaxies .",
    "this was just a very quick glance at the scientific motivations behind the development of mm - submm facilities , and mostly limited to the extragalactic field .",
    "young stellar objects , protostars and proto - planetary systems are , for instance , additional fields where the mm - submm range is crucial for a thorough investigation .",
    "the importance of the mm - submm band within the extragalactic context will become more obvious in the following sections , where i will provide some ( shallow ) background on what we currently know of external galaxies based on mm - submm observations , and where some extragalactic alma science cases will be discussed .    on the technical side ,",
    "it is important to mention that the ( sub)mm is currently the shortest wavelength where sensitive , many - elements coherent detection interferometers are feasible from the ground",
    ". these can simultaneously provide high angular resolution , sensitivity , and image reconstruction fidelity .",
    "direct detection interferometers at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. mid / near - ir ) can achieve similar angular resolution , but are more severely constrained in terms of sensitivity and image fidelity .",
    "m ( _ right _ ) .",
    "note that most of the far - ir emission comes from a region that is heavily obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "credit of the space telescope science institute ( optical hst image ) and of c. dowell ( submm cso image ) . ]      the warm dust emitting at far ",
    "ir wavelengths is mostly heated by the uv radiation field of young massive stars in star forming regions .",
    "as a consequence , the far infrared luminosity @xmath5 and its submm rayleigh - jeans part are considered good tracers of star formation in galaxies . in particular , these bands are useful to trace obscured star formation , since they are virtually unaffected by dust extinction .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig_antennae ] , where the 350@xmath1 m map of the interacting galaxies `` antennae '' ( obtained at the cso telescope , c. dowell , priv .",
    "is compared with the optical hst 20@xmath6 ) .",
    "both these issues will no longer be a problem with alma , which will have sensitivities orders of magnitude better and an angular resolution similar to hst .",
    "as already mentioned , also most of the _ gas _ phase of the cold ism emits in the mm - submm range .",
    "more specifically , it is in this band that most of the molecular gas transitions are observed .",
    "however , _ cold _ molecular hydrogen h@xmath7 ( by far the most abundant molecule in the cold gas phase ) can not be detected directly , since it has no electric dipole moment ( therefore rotational transitions with @xmath8 are not allowed ) .",
    "carbon monoxide co is the second most abundant molecule : its rotational levels are excited by collisions with h@xmath7 , producing the brightest molecular lines in the spectrum of any galaxy .",
    "the luminosity of the co rotational transitions , and in particular the fundamental one j(1@xmath90 ) , are widely used as tracers of the molecular gas mass through a linear relation : @xmath10 .",
    "however , the conversion factor @xmath11 is found to depend on the gas metallicity as well as on its physical conditions ( temperature and density ) .",
    "the critical density of the co transitions is relatively low , at least for the low rotational levels .",
    "for instance , the critical density of co ( 10 ) ( at 115 ghz ) is about @xmath12 . as a consequence ,",
    "co is generally little effective in tracing the high density regions of molecular clouds .",
    "moreover , the large optical thickness the co lines ( at least for the low rational levels ) prevents us to penetrate dense molecular regions .",
    "dense regions are better traced by other species , such as hcn , hco@xmath13 and cs , which are characterized by higher critical densities for transitions in the same frequency bands as the co ones .",
    "for instance hcn ( 10 ) , hco@xmath13 ( 10 ) and cs ( 21 ) ( observable in the 3 mm band ) , have critical densities of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . however , these lines are typically one order of magnitude fainter than co.    , indicated by the solid line .",

    "both figures are from @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    there is a relationship between infrared luminosity and co luminosity , which is by itself not surprising ( as most luminosity - luminosity relations ) .",
    "more interesting is the fact that the relation is not linear , being @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_fir_co ] , from @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath5 is proportional to the star formation rate sfr , while @xmath21 is proportional to the molecular gas content m(h@xmath7 ) ( which is the fuel for star formation ) , the non linear relation implies that the star formation efficiency , defined as @xmath22 increases with the luminosity of the system .",
    "the inverse of the star formation efficiency is the gas exhaustion timescale , @xmath23 , i.e. the time required by the starburst to totally consume the available molecular gas , if the star formation proceeds at the rate currently observed .",
    "the non  linear relation between @xmath5 and @xmath21 implies that the gas exhaustion timescale decreases with luminosity , reaching values as low as @xmath24 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_fir_co ] .",
    "it is clear that the most powerful starbursts are also short lived .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that this picture may be biased , especially for what concerns high redshift sources , due to the incomplete census of galaxy populations .",
    "indeed , @xcite have recently identified some _ powerful _ starburst galaxies characterized by _",
    "low _ sfe at z@xmath02 .",
    "the far - ir luminosity appears to be _ linearly _ correlated with the luminosity of dense gas tracers , such as hcn .",
    "the relation is linear over a very broad luminosity range spanning from galactic star forming regions to powerful starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that star formation always occurs in dense molecular clouds , and that star formation in starburst systems may simply be a scaled up version of galactic star formation .",
    "however , also the linearity between @xmath5 and @xmath25 has been recently questioned through indications that the ratio between these two quantities increases with the luminosity @xcite . moreover",
    ", the presence of an agn may also affect the intensity of the hcn emission , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec_past_agn_local ] .",
    "interferometers allowed astronomers to map the molecular gas in large samples of galaxies , generally by exploiting the co lines , but more recently also through transitions of various other species .",
    "the co emission in galaxies show a variety of morphologies : spiral patterns , bars , rings , nuclear concentrations and irregular distributions @xcite .",
    "the co maps also reveal important kinematic information . in the case of disk or ring - like morphologies the gas kinematics",
    "is generally dominated by ( nearly ) regular rotation . in the case of barred galaxies , the molecular gas kinematics",
    "is often characterized by prominent streaming motions along the stellar bar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is regarded as direct evidence that the non - axisymmetric potential of a bar is effective in funneling gas into the central region ( which may eventually produce a central starburst , or be further driven into the nuclear region to fuel an agn ) .",
    "agns generally heat their circumnuclear dust to temperatures much higher than starburst galaxies .",
    "indeed , active nuclei are generally characterized by strong mid - ir and near - ir emission , indicating dust temperatures of several hundred degrees and reaching the dust sublimation temperature ( 15002000  k ) . at far - ir and submillimeter wavelengths the relative contribution of agn and star formation to the dust heating",
    "is debated .",
    "spectral decomposition techniques , as well as the correlation between far - ir emission and other tracers of star formation , suggest that the far - ir and submm emission is dominated by star formation in the host galaxies , even in powerful qsos @xcite . disentangling _ spatially _",
    "the far - ir / submm emission due to the agn from the host galaxy emission is very difficult , if not impossible , with current facilities due to the lack of angular resolution at these wavelengths .",
    "disentangling the two components is important not only to determine the contribution of agns to the far - ir / submm radiation , but also to constrain models of the obscuring dusty torus , as we shall see in  [ sec_alma_local ] .",
    "identifying the main mechanism responsible for fuelling agns has been one of the hottest topics in the last decade .",
    "non - axisymmetric potentials introduced by stellar bars and galaxy interactions were considered as promising mechanisms , but various studies failed in finding any excess of these morphologies in agns .",
    "co observations offer the possibility of directly witnessing the gas fuelling towards the nucleus .",
    "intensive campaigns have been performed with millimetric interferometers to investigate this issue by mapping the co emission in galaxies with different types of nuclear activity ( e.g. the nuga project , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main result is that there is no evidence for systematic differences , in terms of molecular gas distribution and kinematics , between galaxies hosting agns and quiescent ones . in particular ,",
    "seyfert galaxies appear characterized by a wide variety of molecular gas distributions : streaming motions along stellar bars , rings , nuclear concentrations , nuclear voids and irregular distributions .",
    "the lack of any relationship between the presence of an agn and the co morphology / dynamics , indicates that there is no ubiquitous evidence for current fuelling of the agn .",
    "one possibility , is that the large scale fuelling phase and the agn phase may not be simultaneous .",
    "another consideration is that local agns have low luminosities and do not require large fuelling rates from the host galaxies .",
    "more specifically , most local seyfert nuclei are characterized by black hole accretion rates of about @xmath26 ; at these rates even a single molecular cloud of @xmath27 can keep the nucleus active for about 1  gyr .",
    "the fuelling problem is more serious for powerful qsos , where the accretion rates may exceed @xmath28 . in qsos some mechanism capable of funneling molecular gas from the host galaxy into the nuclear region",
    "is actually required .",
    "however , qsos are much more distant than seyfert galaxies .",
    "the limited sensitivity and angular resolution of current mm interferometers hampers our capability of mapping the molecular gas distribution in qso hosts , which will instead be easy with alma .",
    "ngc  1068 is one of the best studied agns also at mm - submm wavelengths . at the highest resolution",
    "currently achievable the nuclear co distribution shows a broken ring - like structure , about 2@xmath6 in size ( corresponding to 140  pc ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_n1068 ] @xcite . at the specific location of the agn ( cross in fig .",
    "[ fig_n1068 ] ) little co emission is observed .",
    "does this mean that little or no molecular gas is present in the vicinity of the agn ?",
    "this is somewhat contrary to expectations , given the need of gas in the vicinity of the agn both to feed it and to provide the heavy obscuration characterizing ngc  1068 @xcite .",
    "actually , we know that in the vicinity of the agn , on scales of 110  pc , dense molecular gas and dust are present , based on radio and mid - ir interferometric observations @xcite .",
    "possibly most of the molecular gas in the nuclear region is dense and warm , and therefore not properly sampled by the co lines ( at least not by the low rotational transitions ) .",
    "maps of other lines tracing dense gas , such as hcn , have lower angular resolution @xcite , but do show a much higher concentration on the nucleus with respect to co. @xcite detected several molecular species in the nucleus of ngc  1068 tracing not only dense gas , but also a very complex chemistry .",
    "these findings indicate that the agn has created a giant `` x - ray dominated region '' ( xdr ) .",
    "hard x - ray photons emitted by the agn can penetrate deep into the circumnuclear molecular clouds and keep the temperature high over an extended region .",
    "the high gas temperature in xdr s favors the formation of various molecular species such as hcn @xcite .",
    "in contrast , photo dissociation regions ( pdr ) , which are generated by the uv photons of star forming regions , are characterized by a much narrower region with enhanced temperature , making the production of various molecular species much less efficient than in xdr .",
    "these fundamental differences between xdr s and pdr s suggest that xdr - enhanced species can be used to unveil the presence of heavily obscured agns that escaped detection at other wavelengths . within this context",
    "@xcite and @xcite developed a diagnostic diagram involving the line ratios hcn / hco@xmath13 versus hcn / co , where pure seyfert nuclei are clearly separated from starburst nuclei , in the sense that the former show enhanced hcn emission ( but see also caveats discussed in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this and other complementary diagnostic diagrams will be usable with alma to identify obscured agns even in distant galaxies .",
    "( scaled from the sed of m82 ) at different redshifts ( z@xmath292 , 5 , 7 and 10 , as labelled ) .",
    "note that the observed flux at @xmath30 changes very little .",
    "the thick blue and red lines show the alma and jwst sensitivities for continuum detection at 5@xmath31 with an integration of @xmath32 . ]    as the spectrum of a starburst galaxy moves in redshift , the global flux is reduced according to the 1/d@xmath33 cosmological dimming , but the intrinsic luminosity observed at a fixed mm - submm wavelength increases as a consequence of the steeply rising submm continuum . at z@xmath41 such strong negative k ",
    "correction counteracts completely the cosmological dimming , so that detecting a source at z@xmath2910 is as easy as detecting a source at z@xmath291 ( for a given intrinsic luminosity ) .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_sed_z ] , which shows the observed flux distribution of a star forming galaxy at different redshifts .",
    "the flux observed at @xmath34  mm is essentially unchanged within the redshift range @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig_kneg ] shows the same effect by plotting , for a given starburst template , the observed flux at various wavelengths ( and specifically in the alma bands ) as a function of redshift .",
    "the observed flux remains nearly constant in the redshift range 1@xmath36z@xmath3610 at wavelengths longer than about 800@xmath1 m . at wavelengths shorter than @xmath0500@xmath1",
    "correction is not strong enough to compensate for the cosmological dimming . at wavelengths",
    "longer than @xmath02  mm the k - correction is strong , but the observed flux is more than one order of magnitude fainter than observed at 1  mm ; moreover , at @xmath37 there is an increasing `` risk '' of contamination by non - thermal sources .",

    "note the nearly flat trend at 1@xmath36z@xmath3610 at wavelengths close to @xmath01  mm . the predicted flux density in the optical ( @xmath38 ) is also shown for comparison .",
    "]    an interesting consequence of the strongly negative k  correction at mm - submm wavelengths is that in any deep field one expects to see many more galaxies at z@xmath41.5 than at lower redshifts .",
    "this is just the opposite of what observed in the optical , where the distribution of observed fluxes is dominated by the cosmological dimming ( fig .  [ fig_kneg ] ) , which makes any optical deep field dominated by galaxies at z@xmath361.5 , and only a small fraction of galaxies at higher redshifts .    the negative k ",
    "correction allowed the discovery of a large number ( a few 100 ) of starburst galaxies at high - z , thanks to extensive surveys exploiting array of bolometers available on single dish telescopes ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "dusty starburst galaxies at high - z discovered through the detection of their submm continuum are often dubbed as sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "although , high - z dusty starbursts have been also discovered through observations in the mm band , for sake of simplicity we will refer to the whole population as `` smgs '' .",
    "much effort has been invested for several years in the identification of the optical ( or near - ir ) counterparts of smgs , mostly with the goal of determining their redshift through spectroscopic followup . however , as we will discuss in  [ sec_current_facilities ]",
    ", the angular resolution of single dish telescopes is so low ( 11@xmath618@xmath6 ) that several optical / near - ir candidate counterparts are found within the telescope beam .",
    "the optimal way to identify the true counterpart would be to obtain mm - submm observations at higher angular resolution with a mm - submm interferometer .",
    "however , as discussed in  [ sec_current_facilities ] , the sensitivity to continuum of current mm - submm interferometers is low , making this approach very expensive in terms of observing time , especially if a statistically meaningful sample is needed .",
    "@xcite employed the alternative strategy of exploiting deep radio vla observations . given the tight correlation between far - ir thermal emission and radio synchrotron emission observed in galaxies ,",
    "most smgs should be associated with a detectable radio source .",
    "the higher angular resolution achievable with the vla allowed @xcite to locate the position of the smgs with an accuracy high enough to position the slit for the spectroscopic identification .",
    "note also that the large vla primary beam , resulting into a large field of view , allowed the simultaneous radio detection of many smgs in each single pointing .",
    "the identification of a prominent ly@xmath11 in many of the deep spectra provided the redshift for several tens smgs .",
    "the smgs redshift distribution resulting from these surveys is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_smg_z ] ( left ) , and it is characterized by a median redshift @xmath39 .",
    "the redshift distribution is very similar to that of qsos , suggesting a link between the two populations of objects .",
    "the sample of smgs for which a redshift has been measured is limited to a submm flux of a few mjy .",
    "the inferred redshifts imply far - ir luminosities of several times @xmath40 , i.e. extreme ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( more luminous , on average , than local ulirg samples ) .",
    "therefore , currently identified smgs represent only the most luminous population of high - z dusty starbursts ( the tip of the iceberg ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_smg_z ] ( right ) the inferred contribution of smgs to the density of star formation ( sfrd ) is compared with those inferred by uv / optical surveys and radio / ir tracers @xcite .",
    "smgs are indicated with large squares , while small squares show an attempt to account for the incompleteness due to the fact that current surveys only sample the most luminous sources , as discussed above .",
    "clearly , once incompleteness is accounted for , smg contribute significantly to the history of star formation , especially at redshifts around two .",
    "again , their evolution appears very similar to that of qsos , suggesting a close link between smgs and the evolution of massive halos which hosts qsos .",
    "the redshift determination of smgs allowed also their millimetric spectroscopic followup with interferometers aimed at the detection of molecular transitions ( which requires an accurate knowledge of the redshift due to the limited bandwidth ) .",
    "intensive campaigns , especially with the iram pdb interferometer yielded the detection of co rotational transitions for several smgs @xcite , indicating that these galaxies also host huge amounts of molecular gas .",
    "the profile of the co lines is often double - peaked , indicative of a rotating disk or of a merging of two galaxies .",
    "followup interferometric observations at higher angular resolution have found that both the continuum and line emission are very compact in most smgs , a few kpc or even less @xcite .",
    "the compactness of the smgs provides constraints on the inferred central densities , which result much higher than in any other population of starburst galaxies , but comparable to those of compact passive galaxies found in the same redshift range .",
    "these findings , along with the huge inferred star formation rates , suggest that smgs are progenitors of local massive ellipticals , experiencing their main episode of star formation , but which must undergo further structural evolution in order to reach the sizes observed in local ellipticals .",

    "one of the most hotly debated issues on agns is the physics , structure and dynamics of the circumnuclear molecular medium , which is both responsible for the obscuration of agns and presumably related to their feeding .",
    "some models assume a uniform gas distribution in a toroidal geometry , whose thickness is supported by ir radiation pressure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "yet other models assume a clumpy distribution due to the effects of supernova explosions or stellar winds , which are also responsible for making the medium `` thick '' @xcite .",
    "the high angular resolution , along with its spectroscopic capabilities , will allow alma to clearly distinguish between these models , both through morphological analyses and by investigating the kinematics of the nuclear and circumnuclear medium .",
    "[ fig_wada ] shows the expected distribution of circumnuclear co emission according to the torus model in @xcite , and convolved with the angular resolution of alma projected at the distance of ngc  1068 ( panel _ c _ ) : the clumpy nature of the `` torus '' is clearly resolved .",
    "actually , the structure shown in fig .  [ fig_wada ] describes the extended component of the torus ( radius @xmath032  pc ) , which contains a large amount of gas , but accounts only for a small fraction of the nuclear obscuration .",
    "most of the obscuration is due to dense gas on the parsec scale @xcite , as also inferred by mid - ir interferometric observations @xcite . in clumpy models the dust within each individual cloud spans a wide range of temperatures and",
    "therefore emits strongly at all wavelengths , from mid - ir to submm . as a consequence ,",
    "an interesting prediction of clumpy models is that the nuclear `` torus '' , made of out of several clouds , should show the same morphology at all infrared wavelengths .",
    "in contrast , uniform `` torus '' models expect a strong radial temperature gradient and , therefore , the innermost warm dust should emit much more at mid - ir wavelengths , while submm radiation from cold dust should be observed mostly in the outer regions . at high frequencies alma",

    "the gas kinematics inferred from alma observations of the nuclear molecular emission lines will provide important information on the dynamical stability and origin of the circumnuclear medium . in the case of a simple uniform structure , supported by radiation pressure",
    ", we expect gas motions to be dominated mostly by rotation . in the case of a medium originated by the accretion disk wind @xcite",
    "we expect the molecular gas kinematics to also show a clear outflow component . in the case of a strong contribution by sn and stellar winds",
    "we also expect a strong turbulent component , hence a large width of the emission lines even within resolved regions . obviously investigating the molecular gas in the innermost regions will require the observation of species typically tracing dense and highly excited gas ( e.g. hcn , hco@xmath13 , ... ) , which are much fainter than co , but easy to detect with alma .",
    "a detailed modelling of the excitation and emissivity distribution of these high density tracers in agn torii has been recently performed by @xcite . according to these models the flux ratios between these molecular lines",
    "is expected to be spatially highly inhomogeneous , reflecting the inhomogeneous structure of the molecular torus .",

    "the dynamics and morphology of the molecular gas will also provide information on the agn fuelling mechanism . in  [ sec_past_agn_local ] we saw that local agns do not show obvious systematic signatures of nuclear fuelling from the host galaxy , but also that such low luminosity agns do not actually require large fuelling from the host galaxy to maintain their low accretion rates .",
    "the fuelling demand from the host galaxy is however much larger in powerful qsos , whose accretion rates may exceed a few @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , it is important to trace the dynamics of the molecular gas in the host of these powerful qsos , and investigate for instance whether in these systems gas funneled by bars or driven by galaxy merging is common .",
    "however , such luminous qsos are not found in the local universe , while are abundant at high redshift .",
    "current facilities are in general unable to resolve the molecular gas dynamics in such distant systems , with very few exceptions",
    ". alma will allow us to trace in detail the gas dynamics in a large number of qso hosts at high redshift and to statistically investigate the occurrence of various possible fuelling mechanisms .",
    "detailed simulations are already being performed to assess the detectability and capability of resolving molecular gas morphologies in high - z agns .",
    "@xcite showed that not only alma will be able to resolve and detect the molecular gas in the host galaxy , but also the 100  pc gaseous torii expected to surround most of the supermassive black holes at z@xmath02 .",
    "63@xmath1 m to [ cii]158@xmath1 m intensity ratio as a function of galaxy age , by assuming the chemical evolutionary model in @xcite .",
    "the model also assumes log(u)=-2.5 , @xmath83 and that the excitation conditions do not change over time .",
    "courtesy of m.  kaufman . ]",
    "the alma detection of multiple molecular and atomic lines in high - z galaxies and qsos will also provide precious information on the chemical evolutionary status of the galaxy .",
    "for instance , the ratio of [ oi]63@xmath1 m and [ cii]158@xmath1 m is sensitive to the relative abundance of oxygen and carbon c / o .",
    "since carbon is subject to a delayed enrichment with respect to oxygen ( by several 100  myr ) , the c / o abundance ratio is a sensitive tracer of the evolutionary stage of a galaxy . fig .",
    "[ fig_kauf ] shows the expected @xmath8463\\mu m}/l_{[cii]158\\mu m}$ ] ratio as a function of the age of a galaxy , by exploiting the chemical models in @xcite ( the model assumes the physical conditions derived for the qso at z=6.4 , as discussed in @xcite , and that the excitation conditions do not change over time ) .",
    "therefore , by measuring both these lines , alma will allow us to constrain the evolutionary stage of distant galaxies .",
    "in particular , it will be extremely interesting to investigate the c / o abundance ratio in agns and galaxies at z@xmath07 , close to the re - ionization epoch , where the age of the universe is close to the minimum enrichment timescale for carbon ; at these redshifts the c / o ratio is expected to be very low , and therefore the [ oi]/[cii ] ratio is expected to be very high .    in very luminous high - z sources , such as the qsos already detected with current facilities , alma will be able to easily detect several other molecular ( e.g. hcn , hco@xmath13 , ... ) and atomic ( e.g. [ nii]122@xmath1 m ) transitions , which will allow us to perform an accurate modelling of the physics of the ism and to infer accurate chemical abundances ( hence the evolutionary stage of the system ) . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig_wotten ] shows the simulated alma spectrum ( 24 hours of integration ) of a quasar with the same redshift ( z=6.4 ) and luminosity of the qso j1148 + 5251 , which is currently the most distant qso with a co detection . beside the co(65 ) transition , the 8  ghz alma band is expected to reveal several other molecular transitions with excellent signal - to - noise .",
    "finally , alma will allow us to investigate in detail the evolution of dust production in the early universe .",
    "the dust mass in galaxies can only be inferred by measuring the ( rest - frame ) infrared to submm sed .",
    "currently dust masses have been measured only for very powerful systems at high - z ( qsos and smgs ) , providing an incomplete and very biased view , not representative of the global evolution of dust through the cosmic epochs .",
    "alma will measure the dust mass in large samples of high - z systems , even in relatively quiescent ones ( sfr of a few @xmath82 ) .",
    "therefore , it will be possible to trace the evolution of dust mass as a function of redshift and for different classes of galaxies , which can be directly compared with models of dust evolution @xcite",
    ". in particular , it will be important to clarify whether dust produced by sne can actually be the main source of dust in the early universe , or whether other mechanisms of dust production are required @xcite .",
