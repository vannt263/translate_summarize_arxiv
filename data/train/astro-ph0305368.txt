    "it is now established that the universe is accelerating ( e.g. , @xcite ) : the next logical step is to unveil the nature of the accelerating force , for example , by determining its equation of state ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath3 need not to be constant and can vary with redshift .    during the past year",
    "we have seen a significant improvement in the accuracy of the equation of state , @xmath2 measurements ( assuming @xmath2 to be constant in time , e.g. @xcite and also verde and melchiorri articles in these proceedings ) .",
    "all these methods are sensitive to different systematics , yet the results are remarkably consistent : @xmath5 at 95% confidence @xcite .",
    "while this measurement will soon become even tighter with 2yr wmap data and sdss galaxy and ly@xmath6 forest power spectrum release , it still assumes @xmath2 to be constant in time . a significant challenge will be to accurately measure @xmath3 .",
    "there has been a number of papers discussing different methods to measure @xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ) while less attention has been devoted to the more challenging task of measuring @xmath3 without parameterizations .",
    "below , we describe two novel methods : a ) a measurement of @xmath2 that relies on the minimum number of model dependent parameters .",
    "this method uses the determination of the position of the first acoustic peak in the cmb angular power spectrum ( @xmath7 ) and the absolute ages of galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "b ) a non - parametric measurement of the time dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "this method is based on the _ relative _ ages of stellar populations .",
    "these techniques have been described in @xcite",
    "if the universe is assumed to be flat , the position of the first acoustic peak ( @xmath7 in the standard spherical harmonics notation ) depends primarily on the age of the universe and on the effective value to indicate when @xmath2 is allowed to vary over time . ] of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "as noted by these authors , for a fixed @xmath2 value , a change in the physical density parameter @xmath9 that keeps the characteristic angular scale of the first acoustic peak fixed will also leave the age approximately unchanged .",
    "thus an independent estimate of the absolute age of the universe at @xmath10 combined with a measurement of @xmath7 yields an estimate of @xmath2 largely independent of other cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "this can be better understood by considering that for a constant @xmath3 , the age of a flat universe is given by @xmath13^{-1/2 } dz\\;. \\label{eq : ageflatwconst}\\ ] ] the position of the first acoustic peak is fixed by the quantity @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the scale factor at decoupling , @xmath16 is the sound horizon at decoupling , and @xmath17 is the angular diameter distance at decoupling . for a flat universe , @xmath18^{-1/2}dx \\label{eq : rs}\\ ] ] and @xmath19^{-1/2}dx\\;. \\label{eq : da}\\ ] ] see @xcite for more details .",
    "we use equations [ eq : ageflatwconst ] to [ eq : da ] and fix @xmath20 to be consistent with the _ wmap _ determination ( @xmath21 ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  1 shows the allowed region in the age-@xmath2 plane obtained for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "it is clear from the plot that an independent and accurate age determination of the universe will provide a measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "thus by using only the _ wmap _ observation of @xmath7 and an independent estimate of the age of the universe , one can place constraints on @xmath2 , largely independent of other cosmological parameters .",
    "note that this method is sensitive to a different redshift weighting than supernova and cmb measurements .",
    "( which in turns fixes the position of the first cmb acoustic peak ) and @xmath25 , weakly constraining @xmath26 and @xmath24.,width=377 ]    the ages of the oldest globular clusters ( gcs ) provide a lower limit to the total age of the universe . since numerous star - forming galaxies have now been observed up to redshift @xmath27 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the oldest gcs contain the oldest stellar populations in galaxies , it is reasonable to assume that gcs too have formed at redshift @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite perform the most careful analysis to date of the effects of systematics in gc age determinations .",
    "they estimate the age of the oldest galactic gcs using the main - sequence turn - off luminosity and evaluate the errors with monte - carlo techniques , paying careful attention to uncertainties in the distance , to systematics , and to model uncertainties .",
    "they find a best - fit age for the oldest galactic gcs of @xmath29  gyr ( 95% confidence limits ) .",
    "we find that their probability distribution for the oldest gc age , can be accurately described by @xmath30 ^ 2}{2 \\sigma^2 } \\right ] \\label{eq : kraussagecorr}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the age of the oldest gcs , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "since the oldest gcs likely formed at @xmath36 , for all reasonable cosmologies we only need add about @xmath37 gyr to the gc ages to obtain an estimate of the age of the universe . only the oldest ( low metallicity ) gcs should be used in the age estimate , for which there is no age spread ( see e.g. @xcite , which finds no age spread for gcs with metallicities @xmath38 < -1.2 $ ] ) .    in order to constrain @xmath2 ,",
    "we can now assume a flat universe and monte carlo simulate the distribution of @xmath7 subject to only weak priors on the other cosmological parameters .",
    "for different values of @xmath2 , @xcite generated @xmath39 models , randomly sampling the cosmological parameters @xmath11 , @xmath40 and @xmath12 with uniform priors , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the next step is to impose an age of the universe constraint by randomly sampling these models so that the age of the universe has a probability distribution whose shape is given by equation [ eq : kraussagecorr ] , but offset by @xmath37 gyr .",
    "@xcite used the publicly available code cmbfast @xcite to compute the resulting distribution of @xmath7 .",
    "this is shown in figure  2 where the two solid lines are the 68% and 90% _ joint _ confidence levels .",
    "as expected , the age alone does not constrain @xmath2 ; there is a degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath7 . if we now use the _",
    "observed _ position of the first acoustic peak as recently measured , in a model independent way , from _ wmap _",
    "@xcite , we can constrain @xmath2 with high accuracy . the filled contours in figure  2",
    "are marginalized values for @xmath2 at the 68% and 90% confidence levels .",
    "thus we find @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) at the 68% ( 90% ) confidence level .",
    "this determination depends solely on the gc determination of the age of the universe and on the _ observed _ position of the first acoustic peak in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "this constraint is slightly less stringent than that obtained by @xcite from a joint likelihood analysis of _ wmap _ with six external data sets ( _ wmap _ + cbi + acbar + 2dfgrs + lyman@xmath46 forest power spectrum + type  ia supernovae + @xmath47 constraint from the _ hst _ key project ) , but is tighter than the cmb - only ( _ wmap _ + cbi + acbar ) determination and comparable to the _ wmap _ + acbar + cbi + _ hst _ constraint .",

    "note that the position of the first peak greatly constrains the value of @xmath2.,width=377 ]",
    "the popular approach for measuring @xmath3 uses its effect on the luminosity distance of sources .",
    "in particular , the proposal for the supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) mission suggests to monitor @xmath48 type ia supernovae across the sky per year and determine their luminosity distances up to a redshift @xmath49 with high precision .",
    "however , the sensitivity of the luminosity distance to the redshift evolution of @xmath3 is compromised by its integral nature ( maor et al .",
    "2001 ) , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the age of the universe at a redshift @xmath52 which depends on @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative method that offers a much better sensitivity to @xmath3 since it measures the integrand of equation  ( [ eq : d_l ] ) directly .",
    "any such method must rely on a clock that dates the variation in the age of the universe with redshift .",
    "the clock is provided by spectroscopic dating of galaxy ages . based on measurements of the age difference , @xmath53 , between two passively ",
    "evolving galaxies that formed at the same time but are separated by a small redshift interval @xmath54 , one can infer the derivative , @xmath55 , from the ratio @xmath56 .",
    "the statistical significance of the measurement can be improved by selecting fair samples of passively  evolving galaxies at the two redshifts and by comparing the upper cut - off in their age distributions .",
    "all selected galaxies need to have similar metallicities and low star formation rates ( i.e. a red color ) , so that the average age of their stars would far exceed the age difference between the two galaxy samples , @xmath53 .",
    "this _ differential age method _ is much more reliable than a method based on an absolute age determination for galaxies ( e.g. , dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ; alcaniz & lima 2001 ; stockton 2001 ) . as demonstrated in the case of globular clusters ,",
    "absolute stellar ages are more vulnerable to systematic uncertainties than relative ages ( stetson , vandenberg & bolte 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , absolute galaxy ages can only provide a lower limit to the age of the universe and only place weak constraints on the possible histories of @xmath3 .",

    "the subscripts @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 refer to the dark energy , the matter , or the total sum of the two , respectively .",

    "thus , @xmath64 is related to the equation of state of the dark energy through one integration only , while the luminosity distance in equation ( [ eq : d_l ] ) is given by an integral of the inverse of equation ( [ eq0 ] ) , namely through two integrations . by differentiating @xmath55 with respect to @xmath31",
    "we find , @xmath65 ^ 2}{(1+z)}\\left    [ \\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{3}{2}w(z )    \\right]-\\frac{3}{2}\\omega_m(0)(1+z)^4w(z ) , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] which depends _ explicitly _ on @xmath3 without any integrations .",
    "thus , the second derivative of redshift with respect to cosmic time measures @xmath3 directly .",
    "while it is possible to find significantly different redshift histories of @xmath3 for which the evolution of @xmath66 is similar , this can not be done for @xmath67 .    to obtain @xmath68 ,",
    "@xcite proposed to use the old envelope of the age ",
    "redshift relation of e / s0 galaxies .",
    "they assume that e / s0 at different redshifts are drawn from the same parent population with the bulk of their stellar populations formed at relatively high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". then , at relatively low redshift , they are evolving passively and may be used as `` cosmic chronometers '' .",
    "recently , @xcite applied this method using high - quality spectra of a sample of old stellar populations covering the largest possible range in redshift . to this aim",

    "redshift relation consistent with a model with widely different @xmath3 behavior , one would have to infer that early - type galaxies at different redshifts have very different formation epochs for their stellar populations .",

    ", we would have to conclude that the oldest galaxies at @xmath87 formed about 0.7 gyr after the big bang , but that the oldest galaxies at @xmath88 formed @xmath89 gyr after the big bang .",
    "since the oldest galaxies in the lrg sample are as old as the oldest gcs , we consider this to be an unlikely explanation .",
    "furthermore , not only would this scenario require that _ all _ local galaxies either formed their stars more recently than galaxies at high redshift or had recent episodes of star formation , but would also require a remarkable fine - tuning for them all to end up with exactly the same age .",
    "we therefore conclude that this extreme model for @xmath3 is unlikely given the data .",
    "unfortunately , the small number of galaxies in @xcite samples at @xmath90 did not allow them to compute @xmath68 with enough accuracy to constrain @xmath3 , and therefore this measurement will have to await better data .",
    "however , the @xmath91 region is well populated by lrg galaxies ( figure  3 ) and they determined @xmath92 at @xmath88 .",
    "this is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  3 by the clear shift in the upper envelope of the age histogram between the two redshift ranges @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this can be used to determine @xmath47 , which relies upon determining the `` edge '' of the galaxy age distribution in different redshift intervals .    if the ages of the galaxies were known with infinite accuracy , for each galaxy@xmath95 at redshift @xmath96 , one could associate an age @xmath97 .",
    "the probability for the age of the oldest stellar population in galaxy@xmath95 , @xmath98 , would be given by a step function which jumps from 0 to 1 at @xmath97 .",
