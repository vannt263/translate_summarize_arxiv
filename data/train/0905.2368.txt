    "bl  lac objects are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , characterized by strong and variable polarization , rapid variability in luminosity , a featureless spectrum and weak optical line emission .",
    "the radio emission associated with bl  lac objects is synchrotron emission , which can be linearly polarized up to about 75% in the optically thin ( jet ) region , and up to 1015% in the optically thick ( core ) region ( pacholczyk 1970 ) .",
    "vlbi polarization observations of bl  lac objects have shown a tendency for the polarization * e * vectors in the parsec - scale jets to be aligned with the local jet direction , which implies that the corresponding * b * field is transverse to the jet , because the jet is optically thin ( gabuzda , pushkarev & cawthorne 2000 ) .",
    "although in the past , the dominance of the transverse * b * field component was suggested to be the consequence of a ` shock model ' where a series of relativistic shocks compress and enhance the transverse * b * field component ( laing 1980 ; hughes , aller & aller 1989 ) , this seems an improbable explanation for the transverse fields detected in extended regions in the jets of some sources . instead , a helical * b * field associated with the jet , with the toroidal component dominating over the longitudinal component , would be a more plausible explanation ( lyutikov , pariev & gabuzda 2005 ) .",
    "in fact , systematic gradients in the faraday rotation have been observed across the parsec - scale jets of a number of agn , interpreted as reflecting the systematic change in the line - of - sight component of a toroidal or helical jet * b * field across the jet ( asada et al .",
    "2002 ; gabuzda , murray , cronin 2004 ; zavala & taylor 2005 ; gabuzda et al .",

    "2002 ) .",
    "faraday rotation studies are crucial in determining the intrinsic * b * field geometries associated with the jets .",
    "faraday rotation of the plane of linear polarization occurs during the passage of an electromagnetic wave through a region with free electrons and a magnetic field with a non - zero component along the line - of - sight .",
    "the amount of rotation is proportional to the integral of the density of free electrons @xmath0 multiplied by the line - of - sight b field @xmath1 , the square of the observing wavelength @xmath2 , and various physical constants ; the coefficient of @xmath2 is called the rotation measure ( rm ) : @xmath3 the intrinsic polarization angle can be obtained from the following equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the observed polarization angle and @xmath6 is the intrinsic polarization angle observed if no rotation occurred ( burn 1966 ) .",
    "simultaneous multifrequency observations thus allow the determination of the rm , as well as identifying the intrinsic polarization angles @xmath6 .",
    "b1803 + 784 has been studied using vlbi for nearly three decades .",
    "the predominant jet direction in centimetre - wavelength images is toward the west .",
    "the dominant jet * b * field is perpendicular to the local jet direction essentially throughout the jet , from distances of less than 1  mas from the vlbi core ( gabuzda 1999 , lister 2001 ) to tens of mas from the core ( gabuzda & chernetskii 2003 ; hallahan & gabuzda 2009 ) ; further , the * b * field remains orthogonal even in extended regions and in the presence of appreciable bending of the jet .",
    "therefore , it seems most likely that this transverse jet * b * field primarily represents the toroidal component of the intrinsic * b * field of the jet , rather than a series of transverse shocks ( of course , this does not rule out the possibility that some individual compact features may be shocks ) .",
    "we have detected a transverse rm gradient across the vlbi jet ; although it is difficult to prove conclusively , combined with the observation of orthogonal * b * fields throughout the jet , even in the presence of appreciable bending , this provides direct evidence that the jet has a helical * b * field .",
    "comparison of the gradients observed for several different epochs shows that the direction of the gradient changed sometime between june 2000 and august 2002 .",
    "we discuss the data demonstrating this unexpected change , as well as possible origins of the observed reversal of the rm gradient .",
    "we consider here polarization data for b1803 + 784 obtained using the ten 25-m radio telescopes of the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at four different epochs : 6 april 1997 ( gabuzda & chernetskii 2003 ) , 27 june 2000 ( zavala & taylor 2003 ) , 24 august 2002 and 22 august 2003 .",

    "the observations for 24 august 2002 and 22 august 2003 were obtained as part of a multi - frequency polarization study of about three dozen bl  lac objects . in all cases the sources",
    "were observed in a ` snap - shot ' mode with 810 scans of each object spread out over the time .",

    "note that gabuzda & chernetskii ( 2003 ) presented results at 22 ghz in addition to the 15 , 8.4 and 5 ghz results considered here ; we did not include the 22 ghz data in our faraday rotation analysis because this substantially restricted the region in the jet where polarization was reliably detected at all the frequencies used . in regions",
    "where polarization was detected at 22 , 15 , 8.4 and 5 ghz , the derived rotation measures are consistent with the three - frequency results presented here .",
    "the instrumental polarizations ( d - terms ) were determined using the aips task lpcal , solving simultaneously for the source polarization in individual vlbi components .",

    "calibration was done using integrated polarization observations of a bright , compact source , obtained with the very large array ( vla ) , by forcing the evpa for the total vlbi polarization of the source to match the evpa for the integrated polarization ( www.aoc.nrao.edu/  smyers / calibration/ ) .",
    "the sources used for the evpa calibration were 1749 + 096 ( observed with the vla on 10 august 2002 ) and 2200 + 420 ( observed with the vla on 18 august 2002 and 21 august 2003 ) .",

    "we refined the calibration by checking for self - consistency between the various frequencies , and also with the other evpa calibration results for vlba experiments before and after ours that were calibrated using the same reference antenna ( the evpa corrections for a given reference antenna are typically stable to within @xmath75@xmath8 over several years ; see reynolds et al .",

    "although system temperatures and gain curves were provided for all six frequencies observed at this epoch , there may be some concern that the accuracy of the overall flux calibration for these slightly ` non - standard ' frequencies could be slightly lower than for the standard vlba frequencies .",
    "accordingly , we determined the spectra of various optically thin regions in the jet , to verify that there was no evidence for any of the frequencies deviating from the behaviour shown by the others . before determining the spectra , we aligned the images at the various frequencies using the algorithm of croke & gabuzda ( 2008 ) . a typical example",

    "[ fig : aug2002jet ] ) .",
    "an important feature that emerges in a comparison of the various rm maps is the reversal in the direction of the rm gradient in the jet of b1803 + 784 between june 2000 and august 2002 .",

    "[ fig : apr1997jet ] , [ fig : aug2002jet ] and [ fig : aug2003jet ] , all of which are in the same direction ( i.e. , the `` flip '' of the gradient occurred only in the jet region ) .",
    "there are hints of a rm gradient with the same direction in the core in the map presented by zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) , but the range for the colour scale of that map makes it difficult to be sure of this .",
    "note that the observed `` core '' emission is actually a mixture of emission from the core and inner jet , so it is not surprising that transverse rm gradients should be detected in the core region , since the associated helical field is present on a wide range of scales , down to the accretion disk region .",
    "the origin for the observed `` flip '' in the direction of the transverse rm gradient in the jet of b1803 + 784 between june 2000 and august 2002 is not clear .",
    "no radical change in the intensity or polarization structure of the vlbi jet accompanied the observed rm - gradient flip .",
    "we qualitatively consider here several possible scenarios that could potentially give rise to this behaviour .",
    "although it is not possible at this stage to distinguish between these scenarios , our goal here is simply to point out possible explanations , which it may be possible to test with further observations or numerical simulations .    in this discussion",
    ", we will suppose that the rm gradient is associated with a helical jet * b * field that is due to the rotation of the central black hole . in this case , the direction of the observed transverse rm gradient is determined by the direction of rotation of the black hole and the `` polarity '' of the poloidal field component , i.e , north or south / outward or inward relative to the black hole .",
    "* reversal of the `` pole '' of the black hole facing the earth . *",
    "it is obviously not reasonable to suppose that the observed reversal in the rm gradient is due to a change in the direction of rotation of the central black hole .",
    "however , one way to retain a transverse rm gradient in a helical magnetic field model but reverse the direction of this gradient , is if the direction of rotation of the central black hole ( i.e.  the direction in which the field threading the accretion disc is `` wound up '' ) remains constant , but the `` pole '' of the black hole facing the earth changes from north to south , or vice versa ( fig .",
    "[ fig : north_south_rev ] ) . to our knowledge , it is currently not known whether such polarity reversals are possible for agn jets , or whether they could occur on a time scale as short as a few years .",
    "numerical simulations of the generation and propagation of helical magnetic fields for various initial seed - field configurations could potentially answer these questions .    * torsional oscillations of the jet . *",
    "another way in which the direction of the azimuthal component of a helical * b * field could change is as a result of torsional oscillations of the jet , such as those that have been proposed by bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2007 ) .",
    "these torsional oscillations , which may stabilize the jets , essentially correspond to a change in the direction of rotation of the jet , and could cause reversals of the azimuthal * b * field component from time to time , probably periodically or quasi - periodically .",
    "of course , we have only observed a single reversal in the direction of the rm gradient , and so have no information at this stage about whether this phenomena is periodic .",
    "therefore , this model remains a possible explanation for the observed rm - gradient reversal , but we currently have no firm evidence in support of this model .",
    "if future multi - frequency vlba polarization observations show the presence of periodic reversals of the direction of a transverse rm gradient across the jet , this will provide support for this type of model .",
    "* a `` nested - helix '' magnetic - field structure . * another intriguing possibility is related to magnetic - tower - type scenarios for the launching of jets ( lynden - bell 1996 ) . in this picture ,",
    "magnetic field lines anchored in the inner accretion disc are carried outward along with the jet flow and return in outer layers of the jet , closing through the outer part of the accretion disc .",
    "combined with the effect of the differential rotation of the accretion disc , this gives rise to a `` nested helical field '' structure , with an `` inner '' helical field displaying a helicity corresponding to the direction of rotation of the accretion disc and the magnetic polarity of the jet base and an `` outer '' helical field displaying the opposite helicity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nested_hlx ] ) .",
    "the pitch angles of the inner and outer helical fields may be different , most likely with the inner field having a lower pitch angle ( being more tightly wound ) .",
    "the net rm gradient we observe will include contributions from both of these fields , corresponding to the volumes of both of these regions that lie along the line of sight between the emission region and the observer .",
    "the directions of the rm gradients associated with each region will be opposite , and the net observed rm gradient will be determined by whether the inner or outer region makes the larger contribution to the net observed rm . in turn , this will be determined by the distribution of the electron density and magnetic field along the jet and with distance from the jet axis .",
    "the direction of the observed rm gradient could `` flip '' if , for example , the outer region of helical field usually dominates the observed rm distribution , but the inner region of helical field temporarily became dominant due to an increase in the electron density or magnetic - field strength in the inner region of helical field .",
    "such variations in electron density and/or magnetic - field strength could come about due to variations in activity of the central engine and the ejection of jet material . in this case , the resulting reversals in the direction of the net observed rm gradient would most likely not occur periodically , and may follow activity of the vlbi core .",
    "if future observations provide evidence for a connection between epochs when the direction of the transverse rm gradient reverses and periods of enhanced core activity , this will provide support for this type of scenario .    * changes in the distribution of thermal electrons surrounding the jet .",
    "* finally , we should consider whether the observed change in the direction of the transverse rm gradient could be due purely to changes in the distribution of thermal gas in the vicinity of the jet , unrelated to the presence of a helical jet magnetic field .",
    "could the transverse gradient in the rm be due , for example , to a gradient in the thermal electron density across the jet , with the change in the direction of the gradient corresponding to a change in the side of the jet where the electron density was highest ?",
    "in this scenario , the changes in the observed rm distribution would essentially be due to `` patchiness '' in a moving intervening faraday screen , and so would probably occur fairly randomly with time .",
    "we find this explanation unlikely for several reasons .",
    "the first is that our observations and the observations of zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) consistently show the presence of transverse rm gradients over roughly six years , whereas we would expect the rm pattern produced by a moving `` patchy '' screen not to be as consistent .",
    "further , in our 1997 rm map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : apr1997jet ] ) , the rm on the northern side of the jet is negative , whereas the rm on the southern side of the jet is positive : a change of the sign of the rm from one side of the jet to the other is difficult to explain as the result of a patchy thermal - electron distribution , but is quite natural if the observed rm gradient is due to a helical jet magnetic field . with regard to the observed changes in the rm distribution , a comparison of our 1997 and 2003 rm maps ( figs .",
    "[ fig : apr1997jet ] and [ fig : aug2003jet ] ) shows that the rm on the northern side of the jet is negative in 1997 , but positive in 2003 . here ,",
    "also , a change in the thermal - electron distribution is not sufficient to explain these observations : they require that the direction of the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field in the region of faraday rotation has changed between these two epochs .",
    "since a change in the line - of - sight magnetic field is required , this makes it natural to consider scenarios involving changes in a helical jet magnetic field structure .",
    "finally , we note that another possible way to explain time - variable faraday rotation is if compact jet components `` illuminate '' different regions in a static , inhomogeneous foreground faraday screen as they move behind it , as was suggested by zavala & taylor ( 2001 ) for the core rm variations in 3c279 .",
    "however , this is likewise an unlikely explanation for the rm changes observed for b1803 + 784 , because it is difficult to imagine how this effect could give rise to changes in the rm pattern _ across _ the jet .",
    "in addition , the apparent speeds of vlbi components near the region where we have detected the transverse rm gradients in b1803 + 784 are low : an essentially quasi - stationary component has been observed roughly 1.5  mas from the core for nearly three decades , and no features detected closer than a few mas from the core show clear motions ( kellermann et al .",
    "2004 ; gabuzda & chernetskii 2003 ; http://www.physics.purdue.edu/mojave/sepavstime/b1803 + 784_sepvstime.gif ) .",
    "this likewise appears to make it unlikely that the scenario envisaged for 3c279 is operating in this region of the b1803 + 784 jet , since none of the observed compact vlbi features display appreciable motions .",
    "it is interesting to consider the possible motion or propagation of the transverse rm gradient pattern . to compare the distances from the core where the transverse rm gradient is most clearly visible",
    ", we must construct rm maps for the different epochs using the same restoring beam .",
    "we have used the beam in fig .",
    "[ fig : apr1997jet ] for this purpose , and the rm maps for august 2002 and august 2003 constructed using this beam are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : same_beam ] .",
    "we first note that the transverse gradients we initially identified based on the images with their intrinsic beams are still visible in each of these matched - resolution maps .",
    "this is particularly important for the august 2002 rm image , which was made from data obtained at 1543  ghz , rather than 515  ghz , and so had an intrinsically appreciably higher resolution .    as in fig .",
    "[ fig : apr1997jet ] , the transverse rm gradient is visible essentially all along the vlbi structure , out to nearly 3  mas from the core .",
    "the distances from the core where the transverse rm gradient is most clearly visible in the remaining two matched resolution images are roughly @xmath25  mas in april 1997 and @xmath26  mas in august 2003 ; in the june 2000 rm map of zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) , the rm gradient is most prominent @xmath27  mas from the core .",
    "( note that we do not have access to the actual june 2000 rm map of zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) in electronic form , and so our ability to analyze this image and compare it with the other images considered is quite limited . )",
    "the april 1997 , june 2000 and august 2003 rm maps all have similar intrinsic resolutions , and so the positions where the transverse rm gradients are most clearly visible can be meaningfully compared .",
    "however , we see no clear evidence for systematic movement of the observed rm patterns either toward or away from the vlbi core over the time covered by these epochs : the distances from the core are @xmath25  mas in april 1997 , @xmath27  mas in june 2000 , and @xmath26  mas in august 2003 .",
    "this is not entirely surprising , since the separation between our epochs may not be well matched to the time scales on which the rm patterns evolve and/or propagate .",
    "for example , if the rm pattern moves with a proper motion of several tenths of a mas per year ( typical of superluminal motions in agn with redshifts similar to b1803 + 784 ) , it could move and evolve substantially over the three - year intervals from april 1997 to june 2000 and from june 2000 to august 2003 , making it difficult to track the pattern . at the same time , the general region of the transverse rm gradient is also near the location of a long - lived quasi - stationary feature in the jet of b1803 + 784 , approximately 1.5  mas from the vlbi core ( e.g. kellermann et al . 2004 ; gabuzda & chernetskii 2003 ) .",
    "depending on the origin of this quasi - stationary feature , it may be that rm patterns in this region will also display very low apparent speeds along the jet .",
    "more frequent multi - frequency monitoring of this agn with polarization vlbi could provide additional information about the evolution of the rm structure on parsec scales , which could potentially provide firmer constraints on possible models for the origin of the observed rm gradient and its evolution .",
    "we have detected transverse rm gradients across the vlbi jet of b1803 + 784 at three different epochs ; a transverse rm gradient is also visible in the rm distribution for this agn published by zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) .",
    "the presence of a transverse rm gradient across the jet at four different epochs spanning about 7 years provides firm evidence for a helical * b * field associated with this jet .",
    "unexpectedly , a comparison of the rm gradients for these 4 epochs shows a clear _ reversal _ of the direction of the gradient between june 2000 and august 2002 .",
    "this is not accompanied by any obvious change in the jet intensity or polarisation structure .",
    "the origin for this observed `` flip '' in the direction of the transverse rm gradient in the jet of b1803 + 784 is not clear .",
    "we have suggested several scenarios that could give potentially rise to this phenomenon : ( i ) a reversal of the direction of the poloidal component of the intrinsic magnetic field of the central black hole ; ( ii ) a reversal of the direction of the azimuthal field component associated with torsional oscillations of the jet ; and ( iii ) a change in whether the `` inner '' or `` outer '' region of helical magnetic field dominates the total observed rm in a magnetic - tower picture . although it is not possible at this stage to conclusively identify whether any of these scenarios is the origin of the observed rm - gradient reversal , we favour the last hypothesis , because it provides a relatively simple explanation for this seemingly strange event , since a `` nested helix '' structure for the jet magnetic field is a natural outcome of magnetic - tower models .",
    "further multi - frequency polarization studies of this source are clearly crucial for our understanding of how the transverse faraday rotation gradients evolve over time and with distance from the core .",
    "higher resolution multi - frequency vlbi polarization studies can be used to study transverse rm gradients within the observed vlbi core in more detail , as is demonstrated by our 1543  ghz rm image .",
    "we have recently obtained further vlba polarization observations of b1803 + 784 at 543  ghz , which we hope will enable us to trace the behaviour of the rm distribution over a wider range of distances along the jet , all at a single epoch .",
    "numerical studies to determine the feasibility of various scenarios for the reversal of the transverse rm gradient would also be of considerable interest , and are planned as part of our continuing work in this area .",

    "to illustrate why the presence of a rm gradient will not be affected by incorrect evpa calibration , we consider first the definition of the rm , measured by comparing the polarisation angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 measured at two wavelengths @xmath30 and @xmath31 :          we can see through the simple rearrangement in the second equation above that , although uncertainty in the absolute evpa calibration will contribute to the absolute uncertainties of the rm values , the effects of incorrect evpa calibration essentially cancel out when calculating the rm _ gradient _ , since they will appear in the same way in the polarisation angles measured at each point in the image at the wavelength in question , e.g. , in @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this fact must be taken into account when comparing rm values at different points in an image and their uncertainties in order to estimate the significance of observed rm gradients .",
    "for this reason , we have estimated the uncertainties in the rm values at a given location in the map in fig .  [",
    "fig : trans_dist ] purely from the rms deviation of the rm values in a @xmath24-pixel area surrounding this location , rather than using the formal uncertainties from the fits yielding the rm values , since the latter will be affected by possible inaccuracies in the evpa calibrations ."

    "<S> several multi - frequency polarization studies have shown the presence of systematic faraday rotation gradients across the parsec - scale jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , taken to be due to the systematic variation of the line - of - sight component of a helical magnetic ( * b * ) field across the jet . </S>",
    "<S> other studies have confirmed the presence and sense of these gradients in several sources , thus providing evidence that these gradients persist over time and over large distances from the core . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find surprising new evidence for a reversal in the direction of the faraday rotation gradient across the jet of b1803 + 784 , for which multi - frequency polarization observations are available at four epochs . at our three epochs and the epoch of zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) , </S>",
    "<S> we observe transverse rotation measure ( rm ) gradients across the jet , consistent with the presence of a helical magnetic field wrapped around the jet . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also observe a `` flip '' in the direction of the gradient between june 2000 and august 2002 . although the origins of this phenomena are not entirely clear , possibly explanations include ( i ) the sense of rotation of the central supermassive black hole and accretion disc has remained the same , but the dominant magnetic pole facing the earth has changed from north to south ; ( ii ) a change in the direction of the azimuthal * b * field component as a result of torsional oscillations of the jet ; and ( iii ) a change in the relative contributions to the observed rotation measures of the `` inner '' and `` outer '' helical fields in a magnetic - tower model . </S>",
    "<S> although we can not entirely rule out the possibility that the observed changes in the rm distribution are associated instead with changes in the thermal - electron distribution in the vicinity of the jet , we argue that this explanation is unlikely .    </S>",
