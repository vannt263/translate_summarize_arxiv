    "the observational results of the anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite , supernovae type ia ( snia ) @xcite and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite show that about seventy percent of the total energy in the universe should be hidden as dark energy which accelerates the expansion of the universe at present .",
    "several candidate to represent dark energy have been suggested and confronted with observations : cosmological constant , quintessence with a single field @xcite or with @xmath3 coupled fields @xcite , phantom field with canonical @xcite or born - infeld type lagrangian @xcite , k - essence @xcite and generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite which is stemmed from the chaplygin gas @xcite .    in the gcg approach , the conjecture that dark",
    "energy and dark matter can be unified by using an exotic equation of state has been investigated . within this framework ,",
    "the difficulties of gcg associated to unphysical oscillations or blow - up in the matter power spectrum can be circumvented @xcite . recently , hao and li @xcite extend the equation of state of gcg to @xmath4 regime .",
    "many phenomenological tests have been considered : high precision cmbr @xcite , snia data @xcite , and gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "gcg can be extended to modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) model @xcite which can also describe the current accelerating expansion of the universe .    in this paper",
    ", we study the cosmological constraints on the mcg model .",
    "the detailed structure of the anisotropies the cmbr depends upon two epochs in cosmology : the emission of the radiation , _ i.e. _ last scattering and today .",
    "therefore , the cmbr can serve as a test to distinguish models of dark energy .",
    "contrast to the calculation of cmbr spectra , the location of the peaks and troughs can be estimated with much less detailed calculation if we assume that there exist adiabatic initial conditions and the universe is flat @xcite .",
    "the energy density @xmath5 and pressure @xmath6 of mcg are related by the following equation of state @xmath7 where @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are three arbitrary constants .",
    "it is obvious that when @xmath1 is zero , the above equation corresponds to the equation of state of gcg , whereas when @xmath10 it reduces to the equation of state of barotropic fluid .    in the flat @xmath11-dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime with metric @xmath12 the equation of conservation",
    "can be written as @xmath13 where dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath14 . from eqs.([eqnstate ] ) and ( [ eqnconserv ] ) , the density @xmath5 can be expressed by @xmath15^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\ ] ] for @xmath16 , and when @xmath17 , @xmath18^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath19 denotes the energy density of mcg at @xmath20 and the integration constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined as @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . for the flat universe , the friedmann equation reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the energy density of baryons and radiation at @xmath20 , and @xmath28 is energy density of mcg represented in eq.([rho1 ] ) or eq.([rho2 ] ) .",
    "we do not include dark matter in that dark matter is accounted for by mcg .",
    "notice that @xmath22 must lie in the interval @xmath29 because otherwise @xmath28 would be undefined for some time in the past .",
    "therefore , we can find that at early epoch the energy density behaves as matter while at late time it behaves like a cosmological constant except the mcg models with @xmath17 . from eq.([rho2 ] ) , it is easy to find that @xmath30 is only well - defined in the regime @xmath31 for the case @xmath17 .",
    "it is not difficult to find that the mcg behaves as dust matter for @xmath32 and cosmological constant for @xmath33 . unlike the gcg model",
    ", the mcg model does not correspond to a @xmath34-cdm model when @xmath35 , but does when @xmath36 .",
    "define the new variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the critical density of the universe and @xmath40 is the hubble parameter at @xmath20 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath41 and taking scale factor @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 where    @xmath44^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha } } } , \\quad\\text{for } \\quad b\\neq -1,\\ ] ]    and @xmath45",
    "the cmbr peaks arise from acoustic oscillations of the primeval plasma just before the universe becomes transparent .",
    "the angular momentum scale of the oscillations is set by the acoustic scale @xmath46 which for a flat universe is given by @xmath47    here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the conformal time today and at last scattering which are equal to the particle horizons and @xmath50 with cosmological scale factor @xmath51 ; while @xmath52 is the average sound speed before decoupling , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is satisfied by @xmath55^{-1/2},\\ ] ] with @xmath56 the ratio of baryon to photon energy density .",
    "so that , @xmath57.\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the scale factor at the last scattering time , for which we use the fitting formula developed in ref.@xcite , @xmath59[1+g_1(\\omega_{m,0}h^2)^{g_2}],\\ ] ] where @xmath60^{-1}\\ ] ] @xmath61^{-1}.\\ ] ] the location of the @xmath62-th peak can be approximated by @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the @xmath62-th peak shift . the analytical relationships between the cosmological parameters and the peak shifts are not available , but one can use fitting formulae describing their dependence on these parameters @xcite .",
    "particularly , for the spectral index of scalar perturbations @xmath65 , the shifts of the first peak can be expressed approximately by @xmath66 where the ratio of radiation to matter at last scattering @xmath67 is fitted by @xmath68 according to the wmap measurements of the cmbr temperature angular power spectrum , the first peak is located at @xmath69 with @xmath70 uncertainty .    in fig.1 , we plot the constraint on the three parameters @xmath22 , @xmath9 and @xmath1 of the mcg model(@xmath16 ) corresponding to the bounds on the first peak of the cmbr power spectrum ( eq.([peak1 ] ) ) for spectral index @xmath65 .",
    "the constraint on the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath9 of the mcg model with @xmath71 are plotted in fig.2 corresponding to the same bounds as that of fig.1 .",
    "modified chaplygin gas model of unifying dark energy and dark matter with exotic equation of state can explain the current accelerating expansion of the universe . by investigating the constraint from the location of the peak of the cmbr spectrum , we find that the result of cmbr measurements does not exclude the nonzero value of parameter @xmath1 , but allows it in the range @xmath72 .",
    "it is worth noting that an interesting model that investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite is included in ( [ eqnstate ] ) . as a special case",
    ", it requires that @xmath1 is related to @xmath9 via @xmath73 . obviously , @xmath1 can not be equal to @xmath74 for finite value of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , it is available for this case to calculate the energy density by using eq.([rho1 ] ) . in fig.3",
    ", we plot the constraint on the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath9 of this kind of mcg model ( @xmath73 ) corresponding to the bounds on the first peak of the cmbr power spectrum for spectral index @xmath65 . from fig.3",
    ", it is easy to find that for reasonable value of @xmath22 , the value of @xmath9 is constrained in a range of @xmath75 .",
