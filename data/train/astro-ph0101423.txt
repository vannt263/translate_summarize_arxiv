    "about two thousand nearby stars are now being surveyed for periodic radial velocity variations which indicate the presence of extrasolar planets ( marcy , cochran & mayor 2000 ) .",
    "these search programs have been highly successful , and to date they have discovered almost sixty extrasolar planets .",
    "recently , systems with more than one planet have been found , and four ( @xmath1 andromedae , gj 876 , hd 83443 , and hd 168443 ) are now known .",
    "gj 876 ( marcy et al 2001 ) provides an especially interesting case . in this system , a combined , two - keplerian fit to the radial velocity data ( see table 1 ) , suggests that the star is accompanied by two planets on orbits having a nearly commensurate 2:1 period ratio .",
    "the amplitudes of the star s radial velocity variations suggest minimum masses of 0.56 @xmath2 for the inner planet , and 1.89 @xmath2 for the outer planet .",
    "gj 876 , an m dwarf star with an estimated mass of @xmath3 ( marcy et al 2001 ) , is the lowest mass star known to harbor planets .    for these orbital parameters ,",
    "the mutual perturbations of the two planets in the system are considerable . in the case of fixed keplerian ellipses , the orbital elements @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , are constant , and these , along with the mass of the star , serve to determine completely the positions and velocities of the planets at any time in the coplanar case . when the interactions between the planets are non - negligible , however , the orbital elements change continuously , and so one must also specify an initial epoch in order to determine the motion at future times .",
    "every starting epoch corresponds to a different resultant three - body motion .    in figure 1",
    ", we demonstrate this effect by comparing a synthetic radial velocity curve generated by the orbital elements given in marcy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) with one generated by an n - body integration using the same elements as an initial condition .",
    "we used an epoch of jd 2450106.2 , corresponding to the reported time of perihelion passage for the outer planet .",
    "the red line in figure  1 shows the radial velocity curve which results from the superposition of the two keplerian reflex motions .",
    "the black line shows the radial velocity curve resulting from the full three - body integration .",
    "after three orbits of the outer planet , the motion begins to deviate noticeably from the dual - keplerian approximation .",
    "after several years , the motions have diverged completely .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we show that self - consistent radial velocity curves are required for systems such as gj 876 . in  3 , we derive improved , fully self - consistent dynamical fits to the observed radial velocities of the gj 876 system . in  4 ,",
    "we show how dual - keplerian fits can be improved using an approximate analytic model for the interactions between two massive planets in resonant systems .",
    "further applications are discussed in  5 , which also serves as a conclusion .",
    "the orbital elements given in table 1 ( taken from marcy et al .",
    "2001 , based on 54 keck and 16 lick observations ) were derived under the assumption that they are constants of the motion . however , for a system such as gj 876 , where the mutual planetary interactions are strong , the elements will change quite rapidly on observable timescales .",
    "we can therefore regard the parameters in table 1 as a set of instantaneous `` osculating '' elements , which , given a particular starting epoch , correspond to a uniquely determined initial condition .    even with the assumption that @xmath9 for both planets , the orbital parameters in table 1 lead to a wide variety of evolutions depending on the choice of epoch .",
    "for some starting epochs , the planets are not in the 2:1 resonance , and the system experiences severe dynamical instabilities within five years . for other starting epochs ,",
    "the planets undergo librations about the resonance , and the system is stable over long timescales .",
    "one can thus ask : are there any starting epochs for which the osculating elements in table 1 generate an evolution which is consistent with the observed reflex velocity of the star ?    we have computed 10,000 synthetic radial velocity curves using n - body integrations of the osculating elements for the fit to the keck data .",
    "each integration used a different starting epoch spaced one day apart .",
    "the synthetic radial velocities were given a uniform offset in order to match the first keck velocity point obtained by marcy et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "we then compared each synthetic curve to the remaining 53 keck velocity observations , and computed a reduced @xmath10 statistic for the fit .",
    "the best fit occurred for an integration with a starting epoch of jd 2450722.82 .",
    "the reduced @xmath10 value for this fit is 12.14 , and the rms scatter of the velocities about the curve is 64 @xmath11 . given that the observational errors lie in the range 35 @xmath12 , this degree of scatter indicates that the best dual - keplerian fit is a poor match to the observed velocities when mutual planetary perturbations are taken into account .",
    "it is essential to include mutual planetary perturbations when making fits to velocity observations of planetary systems resembling gj 876 .",
    "one can make a fully self - consistent fit which employs n - body integrations to produce a synthetic reflex velocity curve for the central star . starting with the best dual - keplerian fit to the combined keck and lick radial velocity data sets , we have used a levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( press et al 1992 ) to iterate an improvement to the osculating orbital elements reported in table 1 .",
    "our algorithm examines how the @xmath10 value of the fit depends on variations of all 10 orbital elements , and then locates a set of elements for which the reduced @xmath10 fit is at a local minimum .",
    "we assume that the planets are in co - planar orbits , and we allow the overall inclination angle of the system to vary .",
    "we have found a self - consistent model for the radial velocity data which has a reduced @xmath10 value of 1.46 and an rms scatter of 13.95 @xmath11 .",
    "this fit is shown in figure 2 ( black curve ) , and represents a significant improvement to the best dual - keplerian fit reported by marcy et al ( 2001 ) which had @xmath10=1.88 .",
    "the osculating elements are given in table 2 .",
    "we note that the combined radial velocity data favors a co - planar inclination of @xmath13 for the system .",
    "there is , however , a broad minimum around this best - fit value . at @xmath14 , the @xmath10=1.47 , and",
    "the rms scatter is 14.69 @xmath12 . only for @xmath15",
    "does the fit begin to worsen significantly .",
    "the combined lick and keck data sets comprise our best overall view of the gj876 system .",
    "the 13.95 @xmath11 scatter of our best self - consistent fit to this data is due primarily to the large uncertainties in the lick velocities .",
    "it is therefore of interest to independantly examine self - consistent fits to the keck data only . applying our levenberg - marquardt code to the 54 keck velocities ,",
    "we obtain a best fit with an rms scatter of 6.86 @xmath11 , and @xmath10=1.59 . in this case",
    ", the minimum @xmath10 value occurs for an inclination @xmath14 , and the fit displays a stronger minimum at this particular value .",
    "the orbital elements are given in table 2 .",
    "the levenberg - marquardt minimization method rapidly locates a dynamical fit to the radial velocity data for which the @xmath10 value is at a local minimum .",
    "there is no guarantee , however , that this minimum is global .",
    "this has motivated us to develop an independant analytic model for fitting resonant systems .",
    "agreement between the two methods can thus increase our confidence that the true configuration of the system has been located .",
    "we start with a dual - keplerian model using jacobi coordinates , where the inner planet moves on an orbit about the star and the outer planet moves on an orbit around the center of mass of the inner two bodies .",
    "we assume that the planets are undergoing sinusoidal librations about the 2:1 mean motion resonance in antiphase to each other .",
    "the semi - major axes @xmath16 are thus given by : @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "a_2&=&\\bar{a}_2[1-\\delta_2\\cos{(n_{\\rm res}t+\\phi_{\\rm res})}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the amplitude @xmath18 , and initial phase @xmath19 are treated as model parameters , in addition to the mean semi - major axis @xmath20 of the outer planet .",
    "conservation of energy requires that @xmath21 while the resonance frequency , @xmath22 is given approximately by @xmath23 for the 2:1 resonance in the case where @xmath24 is significantly larger than @xmath25 ( murray and dermott 1999 , eqs .",
    "8.47 and 8.32 ) . here",
    "@xmath26 is a constant that depends only on the resonance involved .",
    "the average mean motions @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the planets are related by the condition that the rate of change of the resonance critical argument is zero at exact resonance .",
    "this implies that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the longitudes of periastron of each planet .",
    "the initial mean anomaly @xmath32 of the outer planet is treated as a model parameter , and the initial mean anomaly of the inner planet @xmath33 is then given by the critical argument for the resonance @xmath34 where the initial value of @xmath35 is constrained by the initial values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    at time @xmath38 , the mean anomaly of body @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 these integrals are straightforward to evaluate since for each planet @xmath16 , and hence @xmath41 , is an analytic function of time .    in this system ,",
    "the mutual planetary perturbations are sufficiently strong that the longitudes of periastron will precess rapidly .",
    "we model this by allowing each periastron longitude to vary linearly with time , where the precession rates @xmath42 and @xmath43 are additional free parameters . in practice , we checked that the precession rates derived by the model approximately matched those from an n - body integration using the same initial conditions .",
    "finally , the orbits of the planets are again assumed to be co - planar , but @xmath0 of this plane is included as a parameter .",
    "we used the analytic model to generate synthetic radial velocities for the central star and compared these with the keck and lick observations given in marcy et al .",
    "we initially generated a randomized population of sets of model parameters and then used a genetic algorithm to evolve promising sets towards an improved description of the system .",
    "at each generation , the genetic algorithm evaluates the degree of fit for each parameter set , and cross breeds the best members of the population to produce a new generation .",
    "figure 2 ( red curve ) and table 3 report an analytic model fit for the combined keck and lick data set generated by the genetic algorithm .",
    "the rms scatter in this case is 13.5 @xmath11 , with reduced @xmath44 of 1.47 .",
    "this represents a substantial improvement on the best dual - keplerian model in table  1 ( rms scatter of 21.9 @xmath45 ) .",
    "the fit is remarkably similar to that derived independently using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm .",
    "the osculating elements of a model fit generated by the genetic algorithm for the keck data alone are also given in table 3 .",
    "this fit has an rms scatter of 7.0 @xmath11 and a reduced @xmath44 of 1.67 , which is comparable to the fit obtained by the levenberg - marquardt n - body technique . as with the levenberg - marquardt scheme , values of @xmath0 ranging from 0.8 to 0.5 yield solutions that are similarly good fits to the data .",
    "the most important benefit of self - consistent dynamical fitting techniques for multi - planet systems is the ability to break the @xmath46 degeneracy and determine the true masses of the extrasolar planets . in a few systems ,",
    "the true masses can be found when a planet transits the parent star , but these cases will be rare and confined largely to planets with short periods .",
    "the techniques described in  3 and  4 can in principle be applied to any system containing more than one planet , given a sufficient baseline of observation .",
    "( for short baselines , our techniques are most applicable to systems having massive short - period planets . )",
    "fischer et al 2000 have shown that roughly half of the planetary systems found in the lick radial survey show evidence of a second companion .",
    "thus we expect that numerous additional multi - planet systems will be forthcoming . in the known cases , n - body integrations of the @xmath1 andromedae and hd 168443 systems",
    "indicate that planetary interactions are already producing observable deviations from the multiple keplerian fit .    peale ( 1994 ) has used a roughly similar analysis to the one described here to determine the true masses and inclinations of the planets orbiting pulsar psr b1257 + 12",
    ". however , in that case , a superposition of keplerian fits provides a good approximation to the observed reflex velocity of the pulsar .",
    "this stands in marked contrast to cases such as gj 876 , where the planetary interactions are an integral component of the overall motion of the star , and an analysis based on small perturbations to these keplerian fits may not necessarily succeed .",
    "direct integration shows that the systems represented by the orbital parameters in tables 2 and 3 are stable for at least @xmath47 years , despite the presence of strong planetary interactions .",
    "n - body integrations of the fits to the combined keck plus lick data show smooth librations about the 2:1 mean - motion resonance and also librations about a secular resonance in which the apses precess at the same rate ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "these resonances help to maintain stability by preventing close encounters between the planets .",
    "this long - term stability , combined with the remarkable similarity between the fits in tables 2 and 3 , derived using entirely indepedent methods , suggests that these orbital parameters are close to those of the real gj 876 system .",
    "the main uncertainty remains the precise value of @xmath0 , with our coplanar fits suggesting values in the range 0.5 to 0.8 .",
    "the planets may also possess a mutual inclination .",
    "we have not modeled this possibility .",
    "extending the baseline of observations will make it possible to further refine the orbital fit .",
    "this , however , may take some time .",
    "for example , figure 4 shows the extent to which different fits to the keck data produced by the levenberg - marquardt scheme will diverge in future .",
    "the black and red curves show the deviation of fits with @xmath48 and 0.7 from the best fit with @xmath14 .",
    "the differences between these fits will remain less than the @xmath49 ms@xmath50 observational errors for several years to come .      just prior to submitting this paper",
    "we became aware that eugenio rivera and jack lissauer are developing a scheme similar to the levenberg - marquardt procedure outlined above in order to model the effects of mutual planetary perturbations on the doppler velocity variations of gj 876 .",
    "we would like to thank fred adams , debra fischer , jack lissauer , geoff marcy , stan peale , eugenio rivera and adriane steinacker for useful discussions .",
