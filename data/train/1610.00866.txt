    "quantum dots ( qds ) , also known as artificial atoms , are solid - state devices that confine electrons and exhibit a wide range of interesting phenomena .",
    "for example , the single - impurity or multiple - impurity anderson models that map to qd systems have been extensively used to study kondo physics@xcite .",
    "various interference effects such as the aharonov - bohm effect@xcite and fano effect@xcite have also been observed in qd systems .",
    "they also form the building blocks of devices that exhibit negative differential resistance@xcite and enhanced thermoelectric properties@xcite .    the complete description of the qd system is encapsulated in the _ reduced _ density matrix ( rdm ) , i.e. , the density matrix with the lead degrees of freedom traced out .",
    "the task of evaluating the rdm in a nonequilibrium set - up is non - trivial due to the finite dissipative features of the system - lead coupling .",
    "the complexity further increases when the quantum dots are interacting via a nonlinear interaction like the coulomb force . out of the numerous methods",
    "proposed , it turns out that the quantum master equation ( qme ) approach is the most suitable and efficient method to handle nonlinear interactions in qd systems .",
    "a number of keystone qmes have been formulated with the nakajima - zwanzig master equation@xcite being the formally exact integro - differential equation governing the evolution of the rdm . despite its exactness ,",
    "the equation is impossible to solve for general systems and hence a common simplification is to perturbatively expand the dissipative kernel .",
    "one example of such perturbative master equations is the redfield master equation@xcite ( rme ) .",
    "the rme is a master equation formulated to incorporate effects of weak system - lead coupling and could lead to unphysical negative populations@xcite . in order to avoid this drawback ,",
    "one generally invokes a further secular approximation@xcite that leads to a completely positive master equation of the lindblad type@xcite .",
    "one of the key obstacles with such perturbative qmes is that they can accurately describe the steady - state rdm only when the system - lead coupling approaches zero@xcite .",
    "hence in order to study finite coupling effects in the steady state thingna _",
    "et  al . _",
    "proposed a method based on analytic continuation ( ac ) to capture effects at the second order in system - lead coupling .",
    "the approach was shown to be analytically valid for general system hamiltonians in equilibrium @xcite and numerically tested for harmonic and spin - bosonic systems in nonequilibrium @xcite .",
    "one of the key achievements of this approach is that it does not require the higher order dissipative tensors@xcite to obtain the enhanced accuracy and is computationally less cumbersome than the redfield equation .    in this work ,",
    "our first objective is to extend the analytic continuation technique to fermionic systems and test its validity . in order to achieve this objective",
    "we numerically corroborate the ac technique with the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) approach@xcite for the exactly solvable spinless double quantum dot system .",
    "the ac approach provides an exact solution in equilibrium and in nonequilibrium the ac is numerically exact in the linear response regime . despite its validity in the linear response , we show that the ac method surpasses the accuracy obtained by the redfield master equation ( rme ) and the secular redfield master equation ( srme ) .",
    "our next objective is to study the effect of finite system - lead interaction for nonlinearly interacting systems near equilibrium .",
    "we achieve this by introducing a coulomb interaction and show that in the interplay between system - lead coupling , inter - dot tunneling , and coulomb repulsion could lead to an enhancement or suppression of dot populations that can not be captured by the standard weak - coupling quantum master equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , we present the dqd model setup and discuss the motivation for the choice of the observable . in sec .  [ sec : iii ] , the basic formalism of analytic continuation technique for fermionic systems is outlined . in sec .",

    "is coupled to the left lead with temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1 and dot @xmath2 is connected to the right lead .",
    "electrons can hop between the two quantum dots with an inter - dot tunneling strength @xmath3 and there could be a presence of a nonlinear repulsive coulomb interaction denoted by @xmath4 . ]    the total hamiltonian for an open quantum system including the system of interest , leads , and system - lead coupling has the following generic form @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 describe the system , lead , and system - lead interaction hamiltonians respectively . in this work we focus on the spinless double quantum dot system",
    "whose hamiltonian reads @xmath9 with the two dots are labeled by sub - script @xmath10 and @xmath2 with energies @xmath11 and @xmath12 and number operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the inter - dot tunneling strength and coulomb interaction strengths are represented by @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we consider the leads to be an infinite collection of free fermions with the hamiltonian given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the dispersion relation for the leads .",
    "the system - lead coupling term @xmath17 with @xmath18 denoting the tunneling coefficients . in our nonequilibrium setup ,",
    "the system and leads are coupled in such a way that dot @xmath10 is coupled with the left lead and dot @xmath2 is coupled with the right .",
    "the above system - lead coupling can be cast into a more general form given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the type of the system operators and @xmath21 denotes the position of the lead , e.g. , @xmath22 symbolizes the lead positioned at the left .",
    "thus for the double quantum dot model the system operators @xmath23 take the form @xmath24 the corresponding lead operators are given by @xmath25    the tunneling coefficients @xmath18 can be characterized by the spectral density @xmath26 that describes the properties of the lead . throughout this work",
    "we will consider the spectral density to be a lorentzian , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the cut - off energy and @xmath29 is the overall effective system - lead coupling for the lead at position @xmath21 . in order to simplify our equations",
    "we will set @xmath30 and @xmath31 as @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamics of this model is studied via the numerically exact hierarchy equation of motion approach @xcite and pronounced effects of the inter - dot tunneling strength are observed .",
    "when the temperature or the chemical potential of the two leads are different the double quantum dot system @xmath32 will be in nonequilibrium .",
    "in this situation , one of the most commonly observed quantities is the particle or heat current .",
    "the currents at the lowest order in the system - lead coupling depend only on the off - diagonal elements of the eigenbasis rdm ( see appendix a ) . in the case of perturbative master equations",
    "since the steady - state off - diagonal elements are correct up to @xmath2nd order in system - lead coupling , the analytic continuation technique provides no added advantage . in other words , the currents evaluated via the analytic continuation and the redfield equation would yield the same result for the lowest order of the currents .",

    "thus , we restrict our discussion from hereon to the dot population in order to study the interplay between system - lead coupling , inter - dot tunneling , and coulomb interaction .",
    "the solution of a microscopic @xmath2nd - order perturbative quantum master equation is exact @xcite only in the limit when the system - lead coupling @xmath35 . in other words , even though the solution contains all orders of @xmath36 the correctness can be guaranteed only up to the @xmath37th - order coefficients .",
    "thus , to obtain any higher order effects one needs to rely on the non - trivial higher order quantum master equations @xcite . in order to circumvent this obstacle ,",
    "the analytic continuation technique was introduced that obtains the @xmath2nd - order populations from the @xmath2nd - order coherences@xcite .",

    "the lead correlators , when the leads are infinite free fermions , can be analytically evaluated for the lorentz - drude spectral density [ eq .  ( [ eq:9 ] ) ] as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] .    above since the four tensor only pertains to the left lead all the operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 contain information about the dot @xmath10 ( dot connected to the left lead ) and the left lead respectively .",
    "therefore , the elements represented in eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) would have a complete representation @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "since we assume that the left and right leads are uncorrelated the right lead four tensor @xmath53 will have a similar form with @xmath49 replaced by the dot @xmath2 operators [ eq .  ( [ eq:6 ] ) ] and",

    "the @xmath2nd order diagonal elements of the eigenbasis rdm require the @xmath60th order relaxation tensor@xcite , but in the analytic continuation method we try to obtain these elements via the @xmath2nd order off - diagonals described in eq .",

    "the proof follows exactly from the bosonic case@xcite , since the number operator @xmath73 commutes with the system - lead coupling @xmath8 . in nonequilibrium",
    "since there is no analytic form of the rdm it is impossible to obtain a proof of validity of the mrs . till date",

( [ eq:10 ] ) ] for weak ( left column ) and strong ( right column ) inter - dot tunneling strengths . in the weak inter - dot tunneling regime ( kondo impurity ) , the steady - state local population on each dot is low , due to the negligible exchange . in this regime",
    ", the mrs shows an increase in the local dot population as a function of the system - lead coupling strength .",
    "the rme captures dying remnants of this trend ( seen by carefully observing the gradient in the color ) , whereas the srme ( see appendix b ) , due to the omission of the fast rotating terms , completely fails to capture this behavior and remains constant with system - lead coupling .",
    "since the inter - dot tunneling strength between the dots is weak the dominant effect comes from the system - lead coupling .",
    "the lead can enhance or diminish the single and double occupation probabilities of the system .",
    "the rates at which the leads enhance these probabilities depend on the transition rates eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) , and hence the enhancement rates are always larger than the diminishing rates .",
    "thus , as the system - lead coupling increases the local populations ( @xmath106 as shown in fig .  [ fig:4 ] and",
    "@xmath105 not shown ) of both the dots increase .",
    "the same behavior is observed also within the exact negf approach ( zero coulomb interaction case @xmath111 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the local population is almost invariant with the coulomb interaction @xmath4 for all the three solutions .",
    "the invariance is mainly due to the presence of a small local population that effectively makes the repulsive coulomb interaction negligible .    when the inter - dot tunneling strength becomes comparable to the onsite energies the local population on each dot is higher as compared to the weak exchange regime . in this case",
    ", the coulomb strength plays a significant role as seen from the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the srme resembles exactly the same trends as for the weak exchange coupling scenario and remains invariant with a change in the system - lead coupling . the local population within the rme framework increases as a function of the system - lead coupling at low @xmath4 and shows a non - monotonic behavior for intermediate @xmath4 .",
    "at large repulsive strengths @xmath4 , the rme also shows an increasing trend of the local population with the system - lead coupling strength . on the other hand",
    ", the mrs reveals a definite transition between an increasing local population at low coulomb strengths @xmath4 to a strictly decreasing local population at high strengths @xmath4 .",
    "this feature is not captured by the weak - coupling theories ( srme or rme ) and shows a unique interplay between finite dissipation and repulsive coulomb strength .    at low coulomb interaction strengths @xmath4",
    ", the inter - dot tunneling strength dominates and enhances the single occupation probability that contributes positively to the local population ( see the color scale at low and small @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) . in this regime , as the system - lead coupling increases the leads overall increase the local dot populations similar to the weak exchange coupling case .",
    "thus , at low coulomb strengths we observe that the local population increases with the system - lead coupling strength .",
    "the repulsive coulomb interaction forbids the double occupation of the dots .",
    "hence at large repulsive strengths the lead can no longer enhance the double occupation probability , loosing an important channel for increasing the local population .",
    "but the reverse channel to diminish the double occupancy is still active .",
    "thus , as the system - lead interaction increases the reverse channel becomes appreciable causing an overall decrease in the local population .",
    "naturally , this effect can not be captured by the weak - coupling theories since they do nt fully account for the finiteness of the system - lead coupling , which is the major channel of diminishing the double occupation .     and @xmath105 with varying coulomb interaction @xmath4 and @xmath36 for the modified redfield solution .",
    "the parameter @xmath112 induces an asymmetry with respect to the system - lead coupling with @xmath113 .",
    "the inter - dot tunneling parameter @xmath114 and all other parameters are same as fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . ]",
    "to further strengthen our understanding we consider the double quantum dot system to be asymmetrically coupled to the two leads by setting a ratio @xmath115 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , we consider the case when the inter - dot tunneling strength @xmath114 . if the system is weakly coupled to the right lead @xmath116 , we obstruct the right channel that eliminates the double occupancy .",
    "thus , the local population @xmath106 only increases as a function of the system - lead coupling for all values of the coulomb strength . due to the weakening of the right - lead coupling , the enhancement for the single occupation of dot @xmath2",
    "is also weakened .",
    "this combined with the fact that the left - lead strongly reduces the double occupancy causes the overall local population @xmath105 to reduce as a function of the the system - lead coupling .",
    "it is important to note here that in the symmetric case @xmath105 resembled @xmath106 because the above processes due to the asymmetry were not present .",
    "clearly , as we increase @xmath112 the system smoothly transits to the fully symmetric case , wherein the local population increase as a function of system - lead coupling for small @xmath4 and vice - versa at large @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper , we extended the analytic continuation technique to the double quantum dot fermionic system .",
    "the accuracy of this approach was discussed by corroborating with the nonequilibrium green s function technique . the modified redfield solution ( mrs ) obtained via the analytic continuation method was numerically exact in the linear response regime . far from linear response , the accuracy surpassed standard techniques like the redfield or the secular - redfield approach .",
    "notably , the secular approximation , that is employed in several studies , failed to vary with the system - lead coupling strength wiping out all the finite coupling effects .    due to the accurate description provided by the mrs for exactly solvable double quantum dot system , we included the nonlinear effects of coulomb interaction . using the mrs we investigated the interplay between the coulomb interaction , inter - dot tunneling strength , and system - lead coupling strength .",
    "the local population evaluated via the mrs revealed a complex behavior of increasing ( decreasing ) as a function of the system - lead coupling for weak ( strong ) coulomb interactions .",
    "this switching behavior for weak and strong coulomb interaction only occurred for strong exchange interaction between the dots and could be well explained by carefully studying the effect of the three dominant interactions on the single and double occupancy .",
    "interestingly , the symmetric and asymmetric systems showed contrasting behaviors for the populations of the two dots elucidating the possible role of symmetry in the double quantum dot system .",
    "overall the mrs provided a stable tool in the linear response regime to study the effects of finite system - lead coupling strength in many body strongly - correlated systems .",
    "this opens a whole new arena wherein one moves away from weak - coupling theories and explores the finite dissipation effects with the same ease as that of the weak - coupling approaches .",
