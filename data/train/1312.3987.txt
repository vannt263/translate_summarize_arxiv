    "the quantum mechanical geometric phase was discovered by berry in 198384@xcite .",
    "the context was unitary evolution governed by the schrdinger equation in the adiabatic approximation , i.e. , with a hermitian hamiltonian possessing a ` gentle ' time - dependence . assuming that as an operator the hamiltonian is cyclic , i.e. , it returns to its original form after a certain interval of time ( during which there are no level crossings ) , the approximate solutions to the schrdinger equation are also cyclic .",
    "the geometric phase is then seen explicitly in these solutions at the end of the cycle .    immediately after berry s discovery , it was pointed out by barry simon@xcite that the geometric phase expresses the non - integrability , or anholonomy , of a natural ` rule of parallel transport ' ( a connection ) in a principal fibre bundle , with structure group @xmath0 , which occurs in the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "this was therefore a characterisation of this phase in the language of differential geometry .",
    "the ensuing years saw two streams of work relating to the geometric phase .",
    "one consisted of extensions of berry s original work , in the sense of relaxing the conditions under which the phase is definable . the other consisted of interesting earlier results which could be reinterpreted as instances of this phase , and so as precursors to it .",
    "we recall three significant efforts of the first kind .",
    "aharonov and anandan@xcite showed that the adiabatic condition is not necessary  given a cyclic solution to the schrdinger equation involving any ( time - dependent ) hamiltonian , one can reconstruct a corresponding geometric phase .",
    "this was followed by the work of samuel and bhandari@xcite , in which the cyclic condition on a solution was also dispensed with .",
    "given a solution of the schrdinger equation involving any ( time - dependent ) hamiltonian , over any stretch of time , one can in a simple way extend it to a closed or cyclic solution , then use the aharonov - anandan method to identify a geometric phase . both these extensions of berry s original framework used quantum mechanical notions , specifically the schrdinger equation .",
    "the third step in the direction of increasing generality was taken by mukunda and simon@xcite : the geometric phase is entirely kinematical in content , not requiring a hamiltonian operator and associated schrdinger equation .",
    "it is determined once one is given a ( sufficiently smooth ) curve of unit vectors in any complex hilbert space , without reference to any specifically quantum mechanical notions .",
    "( the relevant expressions and definitions are recalled below ) .    turning to the efforts of the second kind , within quantum mechanics we may cite the bohm - aharonov effect ( already dealt with by berry in his original work ) , and the clarification of the connection between bargmann invariants and geometric phases@xcite . beyond these , it is interesting that many instances of the geometric phase have been identified within classical ( wave ) optics  the gouy phase from 1890@xcite ; the work by rytov , and vladimirskii@xcite in 1938 and 1941 on the behavior of light polarisation in the short wavelength limit of wave optics ; and pancharatnam s studies in 1956@xcite on light polarisation and an associated phase .",
    "these classical optics examples will be reviewed briefly in the next section .",
    "it will be seen that even in these situations the basic idea of a complex linear vector space carrying a hermitian inner product , usually regarded as characteristic of quantum mechanics , is essential to be able to identify ` classical geometric phases ' . in this way , the deep link between bargmann invariants and geometric phases , and the connection to berry s original discovery , are always kept in evidence .    with this background ,",
    "we now describe briefly the kinematic approach to the geometric phase .",
    "let @xmath1 be a complex hilbert space of any dimension , with vectors @xmath2 and inner product @xmath3@xcite . in quantum mechanics @xmath4",
    "is related to a probability ; in classical wave optics @xmath5 generally stands for light intensity which can , but need not be , normalised .",
    "we next denote by @xmath6 the unit sphere in @xmath1 : @xmath7 the group @xmath0 of complex phase factors acts on @xmath6 ( also on @xmath1 ) in a natural way : @xmath8 the quotient @xmath9 , i.e. , collections or equivalence classes of vectors @xmath10 differing only by phases , forms the ` ray space ' @xmath11 : @xmath12 whereas @xmath6 is a subset of @xmath1 , _ the ray space @xmath13 is not _",
    ": the @xmath14 relationship is that there is a projection map @xmath15 from the former to the latter : @xmath16 referring to an earlier comment , @xmath6 is a @xmath0 principal fibre bundle over the base @xmath11 . in the quantum mechanics context , points in @xmath11 correspond one - to - one to physical pure states .    in this framework , given any continuous piecewise once differentiable parametrised curve @xmath17 in @xmath6 , @xmath18 with image @xmath19 in @xmath11 , @xmath20 \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\{\\rho(s ) = \\rho(\\psi(s ) ) = \\psi(s)\\psi(s)^\\dag\\,|\\ , s_1\\le s \\le s_2\\}\\subset\\mathcal{r}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the geometric phase @xmath21 $ ] is defined : @xmath22 & = \\varphi_{\\rm tot}[\\mathcal{c } ]         -\\varphi_{\\rm dyn}[\\mathcal{c}]\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ \\varphi_{\\rm tot}[\\mathcal{c } ] & = \\arg(\\psi(s_1),\\psi(s_2)),\\nonumber\\\\ \\varphi_{\\rm dyn}[\\mathcal{c } ] & = \\text{im } \\int_{s_1}^{s_2 } ds \\left(\\psi(s ) , \\frac{d\\psi(s ) } { ds}\\right)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as indicated , @xmath21 $ ] is a functional of @xmath23 , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 are both functionals of @xmath26 .",
    "an important consequence of this definition is a result involving the so - called bargmann invariants@xcite .",
    "the simplest such invariant involves three pairwise nonorthogonal vectors @xmath27 and is the expression @xmath28 which is in general complex . the fact that @xmath29 = @xmath30 for all real @xmath31 shows that @xmath32 lives in @xmath13 rather than in @xmath33 .",
    "indeed bargmann , during the course of his famous proof of wigner s theorem , introduced @xmath32 simply to point out this gauge - invariance property and to indicate that it could be used to distinguish between unitaries and antiunitaries : while @xmath32 is invariant under unitaries , its argument changes signature under antiunitaries .",
    "it is in @xcite that this object introduced by bargmann almost in passing was elevated to become the basis of a complete kinematic theory of geometric phase .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the framework described above , based on the triplet of spaces @xmath44 , supports the geometric phase concept in a simple and direct way .",
    "though suggested by the formal ( complex linear space ) structure of quantum mechanics , it can be used in other situations as well , such as classical wave optics .",
    "we adopt this viewpoint in trying to define geometric phases in various physical , particularly classical optical , situations .",
    "before we outline the organization of the material of this paper , it may be useful to add an extended remark by way of pointing to the precise context of this work .",
    "there has been considerable interest in recent times to understand the interplay between the spatial degree of freedom ( coherence ) and polarisation degree of _ electromagnetic _ beams [ see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "it is equally important to understand the behaviour of this interplay as the maxwell beam passes through an optical system .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the _ defining _ properties of the age old mueller matrix can not be correctly enumerated without consideration of this interplay or entanglement@xcite .",
    "a lens of focal length @xmath45 relates the output field amplitude @xmath46 ( just after the lens plane ) to the input @xmath47 ( just before the lens plane ) , @xmath48 being cartesian variables in the transverse plane , through @xmath49 but when it comes to vector waves , it is clear that the same transformation applied to every ( cartesian ) component of the electric field vector @xmath50 will not map solutions of maxwell equations at the input plane to solutions at the output , for such a democratic action on the electric field components _ does not _ respect the transversality condition @xmath51 . since this condition is a _ constraint _ connecting the spatial degrees of freedom to the polarization degree , it would be respected only if the spatial modulation @xmath52 is accompanied by ` appropriate ' _ local rotations _ of the electric field components ( local polarization)@xcite .",
    "let us arrange the components of the electric and magnetic field amplitude vectors @xmath50 , @xmath53 in a transverse plane @xmath54 = constant into a six - component electromagnetic vector @xmath55 the approach of@xcite rooted at the very poincar symmetry of the maxwell system of equations led to this fundamental result : if @xmath56 is the amplitude transmittance function of an optical system in scalar fourier optics [ a lens , for instance , has @xmath57 , then the action @xmath58 where @xmath59 are a pair of @xmath60 _ numerical _ matrices arising from the structure of the poincar group@xcite , _ does take _",
    "solutions @xmath61 of maxwell s equations to solutions @xmath62 .",
    "that is , the matrices @xmath59 effect on the components of @xmath63 the correct local rotations alluded to above@xcite .",
    "this result readily leads to fourier optics for maxwell beams@xcite and to electromagnetic gaussian beams@xcite , resulting in a straight forward description of not only the longitudinal component but also the cross - polarisation component@xcite .",
    "it is in respect of this result that the late henri bacry anticipated : `` it is highly probable that a rigorously gauge theory will be developed in a near future '' , the local rotations referred to above constituting `` an @xmath64 gauge group''@xcite .",
    "the work presented here is only the first step of an ambitious programme constituting our attempt towards a possible realization of this anticipation . while the earlier formulation of fourier optics for maxwell beams@xcite concentrated on paraxial propagation about a _",
    "fixed direction _",
    ", the present work aims at laying a global and structurally robust skeleton in the _ space of directions _ , handling satisfactorily the well known topological obstructions . in the sequel",
    ", we plan to adapt suitably the methods of @xcite in local patches of the space of directions , and then ` stitch ' together the patches in a smooth manner to arrive at the general case .",
    "the contents of this paper are organised as follows .",
    "section  ii gives brief accounts of three applications of the geometric phase concept to classical optical situations : the gouy phase in scalar paraxial wave optics ; the pancharatnam study of phases in pure polarization optics with fixed propagation direction ; and the behaviour of polarisation in the eikonal or ray limit of maxwell s equations in a transparent medium with given refractive index function .",
    "the pancharatnam case uses the poincar sphere @xmath65 of polarisation states , for a fixed direction of propagation , while the ray case uses the sphere of propagation directions @xmath66 . in all these cases ,",
    "the use of the basic quantum mechanical framework is highlighted .",
    "section  iii builds on the last example of section  ii in two ways  the generalisation from the unphysical case of a single ray to a physical beam of finite cross - sectional area made up of a narrow bundle of nearly parallel rays ; and the inclusion of polarization gadgets in the path of the beam .",
    "once again the quantum mechanical framework proves adequate , and now both spheres @xmath65 , @xmath66 come into the picture .",
    "section  iv takes up certain global features of the sphere of directions @xmath66 , and builds on a recent suggestion@xcite that passage to the complex extension of the tangent planes to @xmath66 removes an obstruction which exists in the real domain .",
    "( the work of@xcite was motivated in part by earlier works of@xcite . ) using elementary group theoretical arguments , based on the groups @xmath64 and @xmath67 , a particularly simple global basis of complex orthonormal vector fields tangent to @xmath66 is constructed .",
    "section  v uses the constructions of section  iv to study again the beams of section  iii and their geometric phases : in appropriate situations , the complete geometric phase separates into a contribution from @xmath65 and another from @xmath66 .",
    "the final section  vi contains some concluding remarks , while the appendix compares the present framework for handling geometric phases with that proposed in @xcite .",
    "in this section we review three situations in classical optics displaying geometric phases , presenting only the essential details .",
    "the first concerns scalar wave optics , the other two include polarisation .",
    "quantum mechanical notation is used when convenient@xcite .",
    "we deal with the scalar optical wave field in free space , with fixed ( angular ) frequency @xmath68 , wave number @xmath69 and wavelength @xmath70 . in the paraxial approximation to the helmholtz equation , with the positive @xmath54-axis as the propagation direction",
    ", we obtain the paraxial wave equation in two transverse dimensions : @xmath71 where @xmath72 , reminiscent of @xmath73 .",
    "( the exponential factor @xmath74 has been omitted in @xmath75 ) .",
    "this is formally similar to the schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics for a free nonrelativistic particle of unit mass in two dimensions , with @xmath76 in place of @xmath73 , and with the longitudinal variable z playing the role of ` time ' .",
    "the `` hamiltonian operator '' @xmath77 for eq.([eq2.1 ] ) is @xmath78 if we restrict to one transverse dimension , we have the simpler paraxial wave equation @xmath79    our focus is on ` centred ' gaussian solutions to this paraxial wave equation , and their phases . based on group theoretical considerations , it is convenient to parametrise normalised centred gaussians by a complex variable @xmath80 with negative imaginary part , i.e. , lying in the lower half complex plane : @xmath81 then the centred gaussian solution to eq.([eq2.3 ] ) , with width @xmath82 in the ` waist ' plane @xmath83 , is : @xmath84 here , @xmath85 is the evolving gouy phase .",
    "it is the argument of @xmath86 ( on - axis phase at the plane @xmath87 constant ) and ` jumps ' by @xmath88 ( by @xmath89 for @xmath90 transverse dimensions ) across the waist plane : @xmath91 that the parameter @xmath80 lives in the lower half plane is a consequence of our taking monochromatic time - dependence in the usual form @xmath92 .",
    "had it been taken in the form @xmath93 , as some authors do , then @xmath80 would live in the upper half plane .",
    "the evolution of gaussian beams through first order systems described by abcd - matrix is governed by the well known kogelnik abcd - law@xcite , @xmath94 of which the particular case @xmath95 , corresponding to free propagation from @xmath96 to @xmath97 [ i.e. , @xmath98 , is already quoted in eq .. it may be noted in passing that the abcd - law has been generalized to partially coherent gaussian beams , the so - called gaussian schell - model beams , in@xcite and to arbitrary beams in@xcite .",
    "the argument of @xmath129 on the right hand side in the result ( [ eq2.14 ] ) is a quadrilateral in the ` ray space ' @xmath11 , with geodesic sides , as it should be .",
    "the geodesics needed here are to be constructed in the manner of eq.([eq1.9 ] ) at the vector space or wave amplitude level , followed by projection @xmath15 to @xmath11 . a quite subtle analysis@xcite ( here omitted )",
    "shows that in the present instance ( and some others of interest ) we can use ` geodesics ' drawn within the manifold of centred gaussian amplitudes ( which may be called ` constrained geodesics ' ) , and the basic connection ( [ eq1.11 ] ) , ( [ eq2.7 ] ) between bargmann invariants and geometric phases continues to be valid .",
    "next , as the definition ( [ eq1.7 ] ) of geometric phases shows , for practical calculations one can choose any convenient ` lift ' @xmath17 of @xmath19 at the level of hilbert space vectors or wave amplitudes , obeying @xmath130 $ ] . in particular if @xmath17 is chosen to be a closed loop ( the quadrilateral @xmath131 in @xmath11 is of course closed ) the piece @xmath132 $ ] in eq.([eq1.7 ] ) vanishes and we are left with @xmath21=-\\varphi_{\\rm dyn}[\\mathcal{c}]$ ] . beyond this",
    ", one can use the phase freedom at each point along @xmath17 to assume , in the present case , that @xmath17 is a closed loop within the space of centred gaussian wave functions @xmath124 .",
    "it can then be pictured or drawn as a closed curve in the lower half of the complex @xmath80 plane .",
    "one must only ensure that the ` vertices ' are chosen properly , so as to project onto the vertices specified in @xmath11 in ( [ eq2.14 ] ) , and the connecting curves represent ` constrained geodesics ' properly . when all this is done , the result is as shown in fig.1 .",
    "alternatively , the line integral in eq .",
    "equals@xcite the negative of one - fourth of the ( hyberbolic ) area of the enclosed quadrilateral , the abcd - law being a signature of the natural lobachevskian hyperbolic geometry with metric @xmath147 underlying the manifold of gaussian states , the lower half @xmath80-plane .",
    "the area itself is given by the ` hyperbolic deficiency ' which , for a ( geodesic ) quadrilateral , equals @xmath148 minus sum of the interior angles .",
    "the interior angle vanishes at @xmath149 as well as at @xmath150 . for the other two angles @xmath151 we see from fig.1 that @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "thus the deficiency equals @xmath154 , leading to a geometric phase of @xmath155 .",
    "one thus recovers @xmath156 well known in the context of laser beams , now as a geometric phase .",
    "we appreciate that this demonstration of the link between gouy and geometric phases is fully within the @xmath157 framework of quantum mechanics used in the quantum kinematic approach@xcite to geometric phase , briefly recapitulated in section  1 .",
    "now we include the polarization degree of freedom , and to begin with consider the extreme case when it is the only variable .",
    "with given frequency @xmath68 and wave number @xmath69 , we _ fix also the direction of propagation _ to be the positive @xmath54-axis , and consider plane waves in various states of pure polarization .",
    "the analysis again falls perfectly into the quantum mechanical @xmath157 scheme .",
    "dropping the standard factor @xmath74 , at each @xmath54 the electric field is a complex two - component vector in the transverse x - y plane , @xmath158 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath1 for this case is then @xmath159 of dimension two .    as is well known , the spaces @xmath6 and @xmath11 are @xmath160 and @xmath65 respectively , unit spheres in real four and three - dimensional euclidean spaces , the latter being the poincar sphere of pure polarization states : @xmath161 given @xmath162 at some @xmath54 , the corresponding pure polarization state is represented by a point @xmath163 computed as follows : @xmath164 where the @xmath165 s are the standard quantum mechanical pauli matrices . under free propagation governed by the free maxwell equations , the amplitude @xmath162 and the polarization state @xmath166 are both constant : @xmath166 is stationary on @xmath65 .",
    "more generally , we imagine the plane wave passing through transparent linear intensity preserving polarization gadgets which act on @xmath162 and alter the polarization state @xmath166 .",

    "the effect of such gadgets on @xmath162 is again governed by maxwell s equations for propagation of the field through suitable transparent material media .",

    "then over such a stretch @xmath186 and as @xmath187 constant as well , we see that @xmath169 moves on a latitude circle in a plane perpendicular to @xmath181 . in case @xmath188 ,",
    "@xmath169 moves on the great circle perpendicular to @xmath184 , the equator with respect to @xmath184 ; and as then @xmath189 , _ such stretches contribute zero dynamical phases_.    a cyclic evolution in this pancharatnam situation carries the electric field over some curve @xmath190 ( assuming for simplicity @xmath191 ) , say from @xmath192 at @xmath96 to @xmath193 at @xmath97 .",
