    "thus , we do not impose the usual scalar version of quintessence suitable for the purposes of describing the rotation curves as caused by the dark matter .",

    "\\label{hatv''}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we emphasize that the extra dimensional positions of our 4d world , i.e. the functions @xmath86 , are twofold .",
    "the same note should be done on the factor @xmath87 ( twofold values of the square root ) .",
    "the sign of kinetic term for the scalar fields changes with the sign of @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , we deal with two branches of the field variation , representing the normal and ghost phases .",
    "nevertheless , the energy density remains finite .",
    "thus , we have just shown that the energy - momentum 4d tensor of quintessence responsible for the flat asymptotic form of rotation curves in spiral galaxies , i.e. the dark matter contribution , can be exactly imitated by the scalar fields with 2 extra dimensions .    in this paper",
    "we do not investigate the field equations in the extra dimensions .",
    "note , first , that the corresponding components of the tensor @xmath89 , and they do not contribute to the 4d einstein equations through the scalar curvature .",
    "second , in the extra dimensions we can easily find that @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is the energy - momentum tensor of scalar fields under consideration .",
    "of course , we can add two scalar fields @xmath94 and @xmath95 , so that they have appropriate potentials producing @xmath96 , if the field equations are satisfied , and hence , @xmath97 s do not contribute to the 4d einstein equations , while their derivatives are adjusted in order to make the einstein equations valid in the extra dimensions . in that case",
    "the extra - dimensional components of energy - momentum tensor are proportional to the metric , i.e. the situation in extra dimensions looks like the vacuum solution with the curvature depending on the 3d distance as a parameter .",
    "so , the scalar field equations are topics of separate investigations .",
    "thus , we claim only that the extra - dimensional scalar fields with appropriate exponential potentials simulate the quintessential solution for the rotation curves .    by the way ,",
    "once we have encountered the problem of ghosts in the treatment with extra dimensions , we have to note that equations equivalent to ( [ hatv])([hatv  ] ) can be replicated in the 4d space - time , so that the only difference is the overall negative sign of the lagrangian for the triplet field .",
    "the change of normal phase to the ghost for the scalar field is spectacular , since it is closely related to the variation of sign for the energy density .",
    "both these facts are irrelevant in the case of adiabatic growth of the parameter @xmath44 at @xmath98 .",
    "the ghost phase is essential in the asymptotic region of large distances , if we do believe in the constant velocity of rotation in infinity . on another side ,",
    "the negative value of kinetic energy is familiar from the quantum mechanics if the particle enters the classically forbidden region under the potential barrier .",
    "in this paper we have found a quintessential solution for the problem on the asymptotic behavior of the rotation curves in spiral galaxies in the region of dark - matter - halo dominance .",
    "the explanation is constructed on the base of new class of metrics , describing the perfect fluid with a negative pressure in the static spherically symmetric gravitational field .",
    "this class satisfies the principle of superposition for various kind of matter contributions , and , hence , it does not destroys the schwarzschild metric by adding some amount of exotic or ordinary matter .",
    "the quintessence with the state parameter @xmath58 exactly results in the flat limit of rotation curves .",
    "its energy - momentum tensor is simulated by scalar fields in extra dimensions with appropriate exponential potentials .",
