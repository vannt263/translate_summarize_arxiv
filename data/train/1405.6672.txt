    "quantization , also called lossy data compression in information theory , is the problem of replacing a probability distribution with an efficient and compact representation , that is a finite set of points . to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath2 denote a separable hilbert space , and let @xmath3 denote a probability distribution over @xmath4 .",
    "for a positive integer @xmath5 , a so - called @xmath5-points quantizer @xmath6 is a map from @xmath2 to @xmath2 , whose image set is made of exactly @xmath5 points , that is @xmath7 .",
    "for such a quantizer , every image point @xmath8 is called a code point , and the vector composed of the code points @xmath9 is called a codebook , denoted by @xmath10 . by considering the pre - images of its code points , a quantizer @xmath6 partitions the separable hilbert space @xmath2 into @xmath5 groups , and assigns each group a representative .",
    "general references on the subject are to be found in @xcite and @xcite among others .",
    "the quantization theory was originally developed as a way to answer signal compression issues in the late 1940s ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , unsupervised classification is also in the scope of its application .",
    "isolating meaningful groups from a cloud of data is a topic of interest in many fields , from social science to biology .",
    "classifying points into dissimilar groups of similar items is more interesting as the amount of accessible data is large . in many cases data",
    "need to be preprocessed through a quantization algorithm in order to be exploited .",
    "if the distribution @xmath3 has a finite second moment , the performance of a quantizer @xmath6 is measured by the risk , or distortion @xmath11 where @xmath12 means integration of the function @xmath13 with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "the choice of the squared norm is convenient , since it takes advantages of the hilbert space structure of @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth pointing out that several authors deal with more general distortion functions . for further information on this topic ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite or @xcite .    in order to minimize the distortion introduced above ,",
    "it is clear that only quantizers of the type @xmath14 are to be considered .",
    "such quantizers are called nearest - neighbor quantizers . with a slight abuse of notation",
    ", @xmath15 will denote the risk of the nearest - neighbor quantizer associated with a codebook @xmath10 .",
    "provided that @xmath3 has a bounded support , there exist optimal codebooks minimizing the risk @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , corollary 3.1 in @xcite or theorem  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the aim is to design a codebook @xmath17 , according to an @xmath1-sample drawn from @xmath3 , whose distortion is as close as possible to the optimal distortion @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes an optimal codebook .    to solve this problem , most approaches to date attempt to implement the principle of empirical risk minimization in the vector quantization context .",
    "let @xmath20 denote an independent and identically distributed sample with distribution @xmath3 . according to this principle , good code points can be found by searching for ones that minimize the empirical distortion over the training data , defined by @xmath21 if the training data represents the source well , then @xmath22 will hopefully also perform near optimally on the real source , that is , @xmath23 .",
    "the problem of quantifying how good empirically designed codebooks are , compared to the truly optimal ones , has been extensively studied , as , for instance , in @xcite in the finite - dimensional case .",
    "if @xmath24 , for some @xmath25 , it has been proved in @xcite that @xmath26 , provided that @xmath3 has a bounded support .",
    "this result has been extended to the case where @xmath2 is a separable hilbert space in @xcite . however",
    ", this upper bound has been tightened whenever the source distribution satisfies additional assumptions , in the finite - dimensional case only .    when @xmath24 , for the special case of finitely supported distributions , it is shown in @xcite that @xmath27 .",
    "there are much more results in the case where @xmath3 is not assumed to have a finite support .",
    "in fact , different sets of assumptions have been introduced in @xcite or @xcite , to derive fast convergence rates for the distortion in the finite - dimensional case . to be more precise ,",
    "it is proved in @xcite that , if @xmath3 has a support bounded by @xmath28 and satisfies a technical inequality , namely for some fixed @xmath29 , for every codebook  @xmath10 , there is a @xmath19 optimal codebook such that @xmath30 then @xmath31 , where @xmath32 depends on the natural parameters @xmath5 and @xmath33 , and also on @xmath3 , but only through @xmath28 and the technical parameter @xmath34 . however , in the continuous density and unique minimum case , it has been proved in @xcite , following the approach of @xcite , that provided the hessian matrix of @xmath35 is positive definite at the optimal codebook , @xmath36 converges in distribution to a law , depending on the hessian matrix . as proved in @xcite , the technique used in @xcite",
    "can be slightly modified to derive a nonasymptotic bound of the type @xmath37 in this case , for some unknown @xmath38 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , these different sets of assumptions turn out to be equivalent in the continuous density case to a technical condition , similar to that used in @xcite to derive fast rates of convergence in the statistical learning framework .",
    "thus , a question of interest is to know whether some margin type conditions can be derived for the source distribution to satisfy the technical condition mentioned above , as has been done in the statistical learning framework in @xcite .",
    "this paper provides a condition , which can clearly be thought of as a margin condition in the quantization framework , under which condition ( [ antoscondition ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the technical constant @xmath34 has then an explicit expression in terms of natural parameters of @xmath3 from the quantization point of view .",
    "this margin condition does not require @xmath2 to have a finite dimension , or @xmath3 to have a continuous density . in the finite - dimensional case",
    ", this condition does not demand either that there exists a unique optimal codebook , as required in @xcite , hence seems easier to check .",
    "moreover , a nonasymptotic bound of the type @xmath39 is derived for distributions satisfying this margin condition , where @xmath40 is explicitly given in terms of parameters of @xmath3",
    ". this bound is also valid if @xmath2 is infinite dimensional .",
    "this point may be of interest for curve quantization , as done in @xcite .",
    "in addition , a minimax lower bound is given which allows one to discuss the influence of the different parameters mentioned in the upper bound .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this lower bound is valid over a set of probability distributions with uniformly bounded continuous densities and unique optimal codebooks , such that the minimum eigenvalues of the second derivative matrices of the distortion , at the optimal codebooks , are uniformly lower bounded .",
    "this result generalizes the previous minimax bound obtained in theorem  4 of @xcite for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ notation ] , some notation and definitions are introduced , along with some basic results for quantization in a hilbert space . the so - called margin condition is then introduced , and the main results are exposed in section  [ results ] : first an oracle inequality on the loss is stated , along with a minimax result . then it is shown that gaussian mixtures are in the scope of the margin condition .",
    "finally , the main results are proved in section  [ proofs ] and the proofs of several supporting lemmas are deferred to the supplementary material @xcite .",

    "is said to be @xmath28-bounded if its support is included in @xmath49 . furthermore",
    ", it will also be assumed that the support of @xmath3 contains more than @xmath5 points .    to frame quantization as an empirical risk minimization issue , the following contrast function @xmath50 is introduced as @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes a codebook , that is a @xmath53-dimensional vector if . in this paper ,",
    "only the case @xmath54 will be considered .",
    "the risk @xmath15 then takes the form @xmath55 , where we recall that @xmath12 denotes the integration of the function @xmath13 with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , the empirical risk @xmath56 can be defined as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the empirical distribution associated with @xmath20 , in other words @xmath59 , for any measurable subset @xmath60 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , if @xmath3 is @xmath28-bounded , for some @xmath43 , then there exist such minimizers @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( see , e.g. , corollary 3.1 in @xcite ) . in the sequel , the set of minimizers of the risk @xmath16 will be denoted by @xmath63 . since every permutation of the labels of an optimal codebook provides an optimal codebook , @xmath63 contains more than @xmath64 elements . to address the issue of a large number of optimal codebooks , @xmath65 is introduced as a set of codebooks which satisfies @xmath66 in other words",
    ", @xmath67 is a subset of the set of optimal codebooks which contains every element of @xmath63 , up to a permutation of the labels , and in which two different codebooks have different sets of code points .",
    "it may be noticed that @xmath68 is not uniquely defined . however , when @xmath63 is finite , all the possible @xmath67 have the same cardinality .",
    "let @xmath69 be a sequence of code points .",
    "a central role is played by the set of points which are closer to @xmath70 than to any other @xmath71 s . to be more precise , the voronoi cell , or quantization cell associated with @xmath70 is the closed set defined by @xmath72 note that @xmath73 does not form a partition of @xmath2 , since @xmath74 may be nonempty . to address this issue , a voronoi partition associated with @xmath10",
    "is defined as a sequence of subsets @xmath75 which forms a partition of @xmath2 , and such that for every @xmath76 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the closure of the subset @xmath79 .",
    "the open voronoi cell is defined the same way by @xmath80 given a voronoi partition @xmath81 , the following inclusion holds , for @xmath82 in @xmath83 , @xmath84 and the risk @xmath15 takes the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the indicator function associated with @xmath46 . in the case where @xmath87 are fixed subsets such that @xmath88 , for every @xmath89 , it is clear that @xmath90 with equality only if @xmath91 , where @xmath92 denotes the conditional expectation of @xmath3 over the subset @xmath79 , that is , @xmath93 moreover , it is proved in proposition 1 of @xcite that , for every voronoi partition @xmath94 associated with an optimal codebook @xmath19 , and every @xmath89 , @xmath95 .",
    "consequently , any optimal codebook satisfies the so - called centroid condition ( see , e.g. , section  6.2 of @xcite ) , that is , @xmath96 as a remark , the centroid condition ensures that @xmath97 , and , for every @xmath19 in @xmath63 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 a proof of this statement can be found in proposition 1 of @xcite . according to this remark ,",
    "it is clear that , for every optimal voronoi partition @xmath100 , @xmath101 the following quantities are of importance in the bounds exposed in section  [ mainresult ] : @xmath102 it is worth noting here that @xmath103 whenever @xmath3 is @xmath28-bounded , and @xmath104 .",
    "if @xmath63 is finite , it is clear that @xmath105 and @xmath106 are positive .",
    "the following proposition ensures that this statement remains true when @xmath63 is not assumed to be finite .",
    "[ minorationbetpmin ] suppose that @xmath3 is @xmath28-bounded .",
    "then both @xmath106 and @xmath105 are positive .    a proof of proposition  [ minorationbetpmin ] is given in section  [ proofs ] .",
    "the role of the boundaries between optimal voronoi cells may be compared to the role played by the critical value @xmath107 for the regression function in the statistical learning framework ( for a comprehensive explanation of this statistical learning point of view , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . to draw this comparison , the following set is introduced , for any @xmath108 ,",
    "@xmath109 the region is of importance when considering the conditions under which the empirical risk minimization strategy for quantization achieves faster rates of convergence , as exposed in @xcite .",
    "however , to completely translate the margin conditions given in @xcite to the quantization framework , the neighborhood of this region has to be introduced . for this purpose ,",
    "the @xmath110-neighborhood of the region @xmath111 is defined by @xmath112 .",
    "the quantity of interest is the maximal weight of these @xmath110-neighborhoods over the set of optimal codebooks , defined by @xmath113 it is straightforward that @xmath114 .",
    "intuitively , if @xmath115 is small enough , then the source distribution @xmath3 is concentrated around its optimal codebook , and may be thought of as a slight modification of the probability distribution with finite support made of an optimal codebook @xmath19 . to be more precise ,",
    "let us introduce the following key assumption .",
    "[ margincondition ] a distribution @xmath3 satisfies a margin condition with radius @xmath116 if and only if :    @xmath3 is @xmath28-bounded ,    for all @xmath117 , @xmath118    note that , since @xmath119 , @xmath104 , @xmath54 and @xmath120 , ( [ majorationkappa ] ) implies that @xmath121 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that definition  [ margincondition ] does not require @xmath3 to have a density or a unique optimal codebook , up to relabeling , contrary to the conditions introduced in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the margin condition introduced here only requires a local control of the weight function @xmath115 .",
    "the parameter @xmath122 may be thought of as a gap size around every @xmath111 , as illustrated by the following example :    [ ex1 ] assume that there exists @xmath123 such that @xmath124 if @xmath125 ( e.g. , if @xmath3 is supported on @xmath5 points )",
    ". then @xmath3 satisfies ( [ majorationkappa ] ) , with radius @xmath126 .    note also that the condition mentioned in @xcite requires a control of the weight of the neighborhood of the critical value @xmath107 with a polynomial function with degree larger than @xmath127 . in the quantization framework , the special role played by the exponent @xmath127 leads to only consider linear controls of the weight function .",
    "this point is explained by the following example :    [ ex2 ] assume that @xmath3 is @xmath28-bounded , and that there exists @xmath128 and @xmath129 such that @xmath130",
    ". then @xmath3 satisfies ( [ majorationkappa ] ) , with @xmath131    in the case where @xmath3 has a density and @xmath24 , the condition ( [ majorationkappa ] ) may be considered as a generalization of the condition stated in theorem  3.2 of @xcite , which requires the density of the distribution to be small enough over every @xmath111 .",
    "in fact , provided that @xmath3 has a continuous density , a uniform bound on the density over every @xmath111 provides a local control of @xmath115 with a polynomial function of degree 1 .",
    "this idea is developed in the following example :    [ ex3 ] assume that @xmath24 , @xmath3 has a continuous density @xmath13 and is @xmath28-bounded , and that @xmath63 is finite . in this case , for every @xmath19 , @xmath132 is differentiable at @xmath133 , with derivative @xmath134 where @xmath135 denotes the @xmath136-dimensional lebesgue measure , considered over the @xmath136-dimensional space @xmath111 . therefore , if @xmath3 satisfies @xmath137 for every @xmath19 , then there exists @xmath116 such that @xmath3 satisfies ( [ majorationkappa ] ) .",
    "it can easily be deduced from ( [ continuousdensity ] ) that a uniform bound on the density located at @xmath138 can provide a sufficient condition for a distribution @xmath3 to satisfy a margin condition .",
    "such a result has to be compared to theorem  3.2 of @xcite , where it was required that , for every @xmath19 , @xmath139 where @xmath140 denotes the gamma function , and @xmath141 denotes the restriction of @xmath13 to the set @xmath111 .",
    "note however that the uniform bound mentioned above ensures that the hessian matrices of the risk function @xmath16 , at optimal codebooks , are positive definite .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that ( [ continuousdensity ] ) is satisfied .",
    "another interesting parameter of @xmath3 from the quantization viewpoint is the following separation factor .",
    "it quantifies the difference between optimal codebooks and local minimizers of the risk .",
    "[ epsilonseparation ] denote by @xmath142 the set of local minimizers of the map distortion @xmath143 .",
    "let @xmath144 , then @xmath3 is said to be @xmath145-separated if @xmath146    it may be noticed that local minimizers of the risk function satisfy the centroid condition , or have empty cells .",
    "whenever @xmath147 , @xmath3 has a density and @xmath148 , it can be proved that the set of minimizers of @xmath16 coincides with the set of codebooks satisfying the centroid condition , also called stationary points ( see , e.g. , lemma  a of @xcite ) .",
    "however , this result can not be extended to noncontinuous distributions , as proved in example 4.11 of @xcite .",
    "the main results of this paper are based on the following proposition , which connects the margin condition stated in definition  [ margincondition ] to the previous conditions in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "recall that @xmath149 .",
    "[ lienconditionmarge ] assume that @xmath3 satisfies a margin condition with radius @xmath122 , then the following properties hold .    for every @xmath19 in @xmath63 and @xmath10 in @xmath150 , if @xmath151 , then @xmath152    @xmath63 is finite .",
    "there exists @xmath144 such that @xmath3 is @xmath145-separated .    for all @xmath10 in @xmath153 , @xmath154 where @xmath155 , and @xmath156 .",
    "as a consequence , ( [ lienantos ] ) ensures that ( [ antoscondition ] ) is satisfied , with known constant , which is the condition required in theorem  2 of @xcite .",
    "moreover , if @xmath24 , @xmath3 has a unique optimal codebook up to relabeling , and has a continuous density , ( [ localconvexity ] ) ensures that the second derivative matrix of @xmath16 at the optimal codebook is positive definite , with minimum eigenvalue larger than @xmath157 .",
    "this is the condition required in @xcite for @xmath158 to converge in distribution .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the dependency of @xmath159 on different parameters of @xmath3 is known .",
    "this fact allows us to roughly discuss how @xmath159 should scale with the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath33 and @xmath28 , in the finite - dimensional case .",
    "according to theorem  6.2 of @xcite , @xmath18 scales like @xmath160 , when @xmath3 has a density .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that @xmath161 ( see , e.g. , the distributions exposed in section  [ minimaxsection ] ) . considering that @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 leads to @xmath165 at first sight ,",
    "@xmath159 does not scale with @xmath28 , and seems to decrease with the dimension , at least in the finite - dimensional case .",
    "however , there is no result on how @xmath159 should scale in the infinite - dimensional case .",
    "proposition  [ lienconditionmarge ] allows us to derive explicit upper bounds on the excess risk in the following section .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following .    [ mainresult ]",
    "assume that @xmath54 , and that @xmath3 satisfies a margin condition with radius @xmath122 .",
    "let @xmath159 be defined as @xmath166 if @xmath61 is an empirical risk minimizer , then , with probability larger than @xmath167 , @xmath168 where @xmath169 is an absolute constant .",
    "this result is in line with theorem  3.1 in @xcite or theorem  1 in @xcite , concerning the dependency on the sample size @xmath1 of the loss @xmath170 .",
    "the main advance lies in the detailed dependency on other parameters of the loss of @xmath61 .",
    "this provides a nonasymptotic bound for the excess risk .    to be more precise , theorem  3.1 in @xcite states that @xmath171 in the finite - dimensional case , for some unknown constant @xmath32",
    "in fact , this result relies on the application of dudley s entropy bound .",
    "this technique was already the main argument in @xcite or @xcite , and makes use of covering numbers of the @xmath33-dimensional euclidean unit ball .",
    "consequently , @xmath32 strongly depends on the dimension of the underlying euclidean space in these previous results . as suggested in @xcite or @xcite ,",
    "the use of metric entropy techniques to derive bounds on the convergence rate of the distortion may be suboptimal , as it does not take advantage of the hilbert space structure of the squared distance based quantization .",
    "this issue can be addressed by using a technique based on comparison with gaussian vectors , as done in @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ mainresult ] is derived that way , providing a dimension - free upper bound which is valid over separable hilbert spaces .",
    "it may be noticed that most of results providing slow convergence rates , such as theorem  2.1 in @xcite or corollary 1 in @xcite , give bounds on the distortion which do not depend on the number of optimal codebooks .",
    "theorem  [ mainresult ] confirms that @xmath172 is also likely to play a minor role on the convergence rate of the distortion in the fast rate case .",
    "another interesting point is that theorem  [ mainresult ] does not require that @xmath3 has a density or is distributed over points , contrary to the requirements of the previous bounds in @xcite or @xcite which achieved the optimal rate of @xmath0 . up to our knowledge , the more general result is to be found in theorem  2 of @xcite , which derives a convergence rate of @xmath173 without the requirement that @xmath3 has a density .",
    "it may also be noted that theorem  [ mainresult ] does not require that @xmath67 contains a single element , contrary to the results stated in @xcite .",
    "according to proposition 2.2 , only ( [ majorationkappa ] ) has to be proved for @xmath3 to satisfy the assumptions of theorem  [ mainresult ] . since proving that @xmath174 may be difficult , even for simple distributions , it seems easier to check the assumptions of theorem  [ mainresult ] than the assumptions required in @xcite .",
    "an illustration of this point is given in section  [ gaussianmixture ] .",
    "as will be shown in proposition  [ minimax ] , the dependency on @xmath145 turns out to be sharp when @xmath175 .",
    "in fact , tuning this separation factor is the core of the demonstration of the minimax results in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "this subsection is devoted to obtaining a minimax lower bound on the excess risk over a set of distributions with continuous densities , unique optimal codebook , and satisfying a margin condition , in which some parameters , such as @xmath105 are fixed or uniformly lower - bounded .",

    "this shows that a uniform separation assumption is needed to derive a sharp uniform convergence rate over a set of distributions .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , proposition  [ minimax ] also confirms that the minimax distortion rate over the set of distributions with continuous densities , unique optimal codebooks , and such that the minimum eigenvalues of the hessian matrices are uniformly lower bounded by @xmath192 , is still @xmath176 in the case where @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",

    "consequently , an open question is whether the upper bounds stated in theorem  [ mainresult ] remains accurate with respect to @xmath145 in this case .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to illustrate the results exposed in section  [ results ] with gaussian mixtures in dimension @xmath199 .",
    "the gaussian mixture model is a typical and well - defined clustering example .    in general , a gaussian mixture distribution @xmath200 is defined by its density @xmath201 where @xmath202 denotes the number of components of the mixture , and the @xmath203 s denote the weights of the mixture , which satisfy @xmath204 .",
