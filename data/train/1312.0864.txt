    "<S> the characterization and manipulation of deposited magnetic clusters or molecules on surfaces is a prerequisite for future utilization . for this purpose spin - flip inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy using a scanning tunneling microscope proved to be very precise in determining e.g. exchange constants in deposited finite spin chains in the mev range . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we provide numerical justification for the underlying assumptions made in such investigations . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we study the impurity magnetization of antiferromagnetic chains for varying couplings to a conduction electron band of a metal substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we show under which circumstances the screening of a part of the system enables one to deduce molecular parameters of the remainder from level crossings in an applied field .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction_the question whether and how deposited magnetic clusters or molecules change their magnetic properties when deposited on a metallic substrate is of fundamental importance especially in view of possible applications as next generation storage devices or magnetic logic circuits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one experimental method to investigate local magnetic properties is spin - flip inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy with a scanning tunneling microscope @xcite . in this method </S>",
    "<S> jumps of the differential conductivity signal transitions between magnetic levels of the deposited entity , of course under the assumption of a weak coupling to the substrate . following this philosophy the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite conjectured the strength of superexchange interactions in deposited molecular nanomagnets . </S>",
    "<S> the latter were constructed by depositing layers of cobalt phthalocyanine molecules which self - organized in a stacked manner so that the cobalt ions formed finite spin chains on the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this arrangement is scetched in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> is coupled to the metal surface with strength @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 and @xmath0 are unknown , @xmath1 shall be derived from experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) shows a triangular configuration discussed later in this letter.,width=207 ]    when interpreting the observed structure of magnetic levels in such measurements one has to conjecture whether and how much of the deposited magnetic moment is screened by the conduction electrons , since this has a great influence on the magnetic properties of the remainder . in ref . @xcite it was deduced that the co@xmath2 spin with @xmath3 closest to the surface was completely kondo - screened and therefore the observed magnetic levels should result from a practically uncoupled remainder of @xmath4 spins .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we investigate by means of the numerical renormalization group method ( nrg ) @xcite numerically exactly how the magnetic properties of deposited structures as those shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ molsurf - f - a ] depend on the exchange coupling @xmath0 to the substrate s conduction electrons , the internal exchange coupling @xmath1 , and the applied magnetic field @xmath5 at low temperature @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on @xmath0 the screening can vary between full screening and partial screening of the spin-1/2 closest to the surface . in the case of full screening the magnetic properties of the deposited entity are indeed identical to those of the remaining spin system without the screened spin .    for our investigations </S>",
    "<S> we employ a single - channel single - impurity kondo model as a minimal model to describe the correlations induced by the exchange interaction between the conduction electrons of the non - magnetic metal and one spin of the magnetic molecule @xcite . as already demonstrated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the magnetization steps due to ground state level crossings in an applied magnetic field can be used as fingerprints of the underlying spin model . </S>",
    "<S> this will be shown by investigating different sizes of chains as well as triangular arrangements of magnetic moments .    </S>",
    "<S> _ reminder on nrg_in order to model a molecule and its coupling to a surface we use the following hamiltonian which consists of three parts @xcite : @xmath7 the first part @xmath8 represents non - interacting electrons on a lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the hopping parameter @xmath9 is non - zero only if the lattice sites @xmath10 , @xmath11 are nearest neighbours . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are fermionic creation and annihilation operators for electrons with spin direction @xmath14 . the interaction with an external magnetic field @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> is given by the zeeman term with @xmath15 representing the effective electron spin at lattice site @xmath10 , @xmath16 the g - factor and @xmath17 the bohr magneton . </S>",
    "<S> the second part @xmath18 models the impurity , i.e. , the molecule or chain via an effective heisenberg model for all connected spins @xmath19 and a zeeman term . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is the interaction between spins @xmath10 and @xmath11 and antiferromagnetic for @xmath21 , @xmath22 the last part @xmath23 describes the kondo - like interaction of the molecule with the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constant @xmath0 is positive for antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath24 to calculate thermodynamic values within this modell we use wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) with the discretization scheme proposed by itko and pruschke @xcite and a @xmath25-averaging for 2 values </S>",
    "<S> . a constant density of states is assumed .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that in reality molecular orbitals of phthalocyanine molecules hybridize with surface states , compare e.g. @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach , like others @xcite , simplifies the situation to a point where the deposited molecule is reduced to its spin degrees of freedom which interact with the metal s conduction electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> _ results and interpretation_before we discuss our numerical results of a finite spin chain interacting with a metal substrate we would like to shortly look at a free three - site chain of spins @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> its levels split under the influence of an applied magnetic field as depicted on the l.h.s . of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ molsurf - f - c ] . at a certain magnetic field value @xmath26 the lowest @xmath27 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 levels cross . </S>",
    "<S> if the lowest spin of the trimer would be completely screened , the remaining dimer would possess a different level scheme with a different crossing field @xmath29 as depicted on the r.h.s . of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ molsurf - f - c ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , infering @xmath1 from spectroscopic data or equivalently from crossing fields strongly depends on the degree of screening .     </S>",
    "<S> ( l.h.s . ) and of a dimer of two spins @xmath3 ( r.h.s.).,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]   ( l.h.s . ) and of a dimer of two spins @xmath3 ( r.h.s.).,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    in the following we discuss the so - called impurity magnetization , i.e. the thermal expectation value of molecular magnetic moment @xmath30 as a function of the applied field for various couplings to the substrate . in order to work with reasonable numbers we set the intramolecular coupling to @xmath31  mev and the half - bandwidth of the metal to @xmath32 ev . as the temperature </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath33  k , which is lower than the intramolecular coupling , but not too low so that thermodynamic functions are still smooth .    after looking at the lowest zeeman levels of a free trimer we now consider the coupling of such a trimer to a surface as described by eq . </S>",

    "<S> . the strength of the coupling is parametrized by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity magnetization curves depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ trimer ] cover the whole range from the free ( @xmath34 ) or weakly coupled case to the strongly coupled case , which is reached for @xmath35 ev . while the case @xmath0 = 0 coincides with the discussed free trimer by construction , the strongly coupled case coincides with the magnetization curve of a free dimer .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) ; vertical lines mark the crossing fields for various scenarios ; @xmath36  k.,width=321 ]    additionally to the magnetization curves , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ trimer ] includes the crossing fields for various scenarios which can be derived from the magnetization curves . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical lines marking these fields shift from the analytical solution of a free trimer towards the analytical solution of a free dimer for increasing coupling to the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solutions thus are boundaries for the crossing field independent of the coupling @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> focusing on the strong coupling regime , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ trimer15 ] shows variations of the couplings @xmath1 and @xmath0 . within this regime , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. for strong enough @xmath0 , the magnetization curves are independent of @xmath0 and coincide with the solution for a free dimer and thus depend on the coupling @xmath1 in the same way the analytical solution does . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the crossing field is given by @xmath37 . given a strong enough coupling to reach the strong coupling regime it is therefore possible to derive @xmath1 from the crossing field . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation also shows that the maximum uncertainty in the determination of @xmath1 , in the case of unknown @xmath0 , is given by the difference between the ( analytical ) solutions for the crossing field of the unscreened system and the fully screened one .    </S>",
    "<S> k. the magnetization curve depends only on @xmath1 , not on @xmath0 in the strong coupling case.,width=321 ]    similiar results are obtained if a triangular structure is used , where all three spins couple to each other , but still only one couples to the substrate , compare fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ molsurf - f - a ]  ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of @xmath34 analytical results can be obtained for both trimer chain and triangle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these show that the magnetization curves and thus the crossing fields coincide for t @xmath38 0 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ trimertriangle ] shows the magnetization curves of triangle and trimer chain for finite temperature where the curves for @xmath34 feature small differences . </S>",
    "<S> for intermediate couplings to the substrate , @xmath39  ev , the differences are more pronounced .    </S>",
    "<S> k.,width=321 ]    figure [ trimertriangle ] furthermore shows the case of strong coupling to the substrate , again @xmath35  ev . in this case trimer chain and triangle </S>",
    "<S> are indistinguishable on the basis of their magnetization curves and thus their crossing fields , compare @xmath40-symbols and upright triangles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ trimertriangle ] .    after considering the triangle , and thus a slightly different structure of the impurity </S>",
    "<S> , we now come back to chain - like impurities and extend our original trimer chain to four and five spins analogous to the experiment in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ tetramer ] shows the magnetization curves of a tetramer chain for various couplings to the substrate .    </S>",
    "<S> k.,width=321 ]    the curves are affected by the coupling to the substrate in a similar way to those of the trimer chain with the crossing fields decreasing for stronger couplings . in the strong coupling regime </S>",
    "<S> the tetramer chain then shows the same magnetization curve and crossing field as the free trimer . </S>",
    "<S> analogously the magnetization curve and crossing fields of the pentamer chain , as depicted in fig .  [ pentamer ] , coincide with those of the free tetramer in the strong coupling limit .    </S>",
    "<S> k.,width=321 ]    unlike the other figures , figures [ tetramer ] and [ pentamer ] include vertical lines which confine areas of ( practically ) constant magnetization for the free and the strongly coupled chains at a now very low temperature of @xmath41  k. for those areas an arrow indicates whether the magnetization is increased ( green arrow ) or decreased ( red arrow ) due to the coupling to the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> for the tetramer chain with its ground state spin of @xmath42 the screening leads to an increased magnetization at ( and thus a responce to ) small magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast the magnetization for the pentamer chain with its ground state spin of @xmath43 is decreased at small magnetic fields and thus will not respond to small magnetic fields in the strong coupling regime .    summarizing , </S>",
    "<S> nrg calculations of the impurity magnetization provide a very valuable tool in order to rationalize experimental assumptions and results as for instance those of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> future investigations of more complicated impurities as for instance magnetic molecules with non - heisenberg terms in the hamiltonian pose no problem , but nrg is technically limited to single - channel ( or with massive super computing time to two - channel ) contacts . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the rapidly growing hilbert space dimension which is already for two channels the square of the dimension for one channel . </S>"
