    "fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic have been invented by lotfi ali asker zadeh .",
    "this is a theory that started from a generalization of the set concept and the notion of a truth value ( for an overview , for example , see  @xcite ) . in fuzzy set theory",
    ", an element of a fuzzy subset belongs to it to a degree , which is usually a number between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if we have a fuzzy subset of white colors , then all the gray - scale colors are white to a certain degree and , thus , belong to t his set with a degree .",
    "the following definition by zadeh himself explains what fuzzy logic is :    fuzzy logic is a precise system of reasoning , deduction and computation in which the objects of discourse and analysis are associated with information which is , or is allowed to be , imprecise , uncertain , incomplete , unreliable , partially true or partially possible .",
    "categories , which were invented by samuel eilenberg and saunders mac lane , form a very high - level abstract mathematical theory that unifies all branches of mathematics .",
    "category theory plays a central role in modern mathematics and theoretical computer science , and , in addition , it is used in mathematical physics , in software engineering , etc .",
    "categories have been used to model and study logical systems . in particular , the dialectica categories of de paiva  @xcite are categorical model of linear logic  @xcite .",
    "these categories have been used to model petri nets  @xcite , the lambek calculus  @xcite , state in programming  @xcite , and to define fuzzy petri nets  @xcite . using some of the ideas in our previous work on fuzzy petri nets",
    ", we wanted to develop the idea of fuzzy topological systems , that is , the fuzzy counterpart of vickers s  @xcite topological systems . in this note",
    ", we present fuzzy topological systems and discuss some of their properties .",
    "the dialectica categories construction ( see for example  @xcite ) can be instantiated using any lineale and the basic category @xmath4 . as discussed in  @xcite , the unit interval , since it is a heyting algebra , has all the properties of a lineale structure .",
    "recall that a lineale is a structure defined as follows :    the quintuple @xmath5 is a lineale if :    * @xmath6 is poset , * @xmath7 is an order - preserving multiplication , such that @xmath8 is a symmetric monoidal structure ( i.e. , for all @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) . *",
    "if for any @xmath11 exists a largest @xmath12 such that @xmath13 , then this element is denoted @xmath14 and is called the pseudo - complement of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "now , one can prove that the quintuple @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the unit interval , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , is a lineale .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be nonempty sets .",
    "a binary fuzzy relation @xmath24 in @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a fuzzy subset of @xmath25 , or @xmath26 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is interpreted as the _ degree _ of membership of the ordered pair @xmath28 in @xmath24 .",
    "let us now define a category of fuzzy relations .",
    "the category @xmath3 has as objects triples @xmath29 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are sets and @xmath30 is a map @xmath31 .",
    "thus , each object is a fuzzy relation .",
    "a map from @xmath32 to @xmath33 is a pair of @xmath4 maps @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 such that @xmath37 or in pictorial form :    uy & ^_ug & ux + ^f_y & & _ + vy & _ &    assume that @xmath34 and @xmath38 are the following arrows : @xmath39 then @xmath40 such that @xmath41    tensor products and the internal - hom in @xmath3 are given as in the girard - variant of the dialectica construction  @xcite . given objects @xmath29 and @xmath42 , the tensor product @xmath43 is @xmath44 , where the @xmath45 is the relation that , using the lineale structure of @xmath46 , takes the minimum of the membership degrees .",
    "the linear function - space or internal - hom is given by @xmath47 , where again the relation @xmath48 is given by the implication in the lineale .",
    "with this structure we obtain :    the category @xmath49 is a monoidal closed category with products and coproducts .",
    "products and coproducts are given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the fuzzy relation that is defined as follows @xmath53 similarly for the coproduct @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath29 be an object of @xmath3 , where @xmath23 is a frame , that is , a poset @xmath55 where    1 .",
    "every subset @xmath56 of @xmath23 has a join 2 .",
    "every finite subset @xmath56 of @xmath23 has a meet 3 .",
    "binary meets distribute over joins , if @xmath57 is a subset of @xmath23 : @xmath58    given such a triple , we can view @xmath59 as a _ fuzzy topological system _ , that is , the fuzzy counterpart of vickers s  @xcite _ topological systems_.    a _ topological system _ in vicker s monograph@xcite is a triple @xmath60 , where @xmath23 is a frame whose elements are called _ opens _ and @xmath22 is a set whose elements are called _ points_. also , the relation @xmath61 is a subset of @xmath25 , and when @xmath62 , we say that @xmath63 _ satisfies _ @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , the following must hold    * if @xmath56 is a finite subset of @xmath23 , then @xmath65 * if @xmath56 is any subset of @xmath23 , then @xmath66    given two topological systems @xmath67 and @xmath68 , a map from @xmath67 to @xmath68 consists of a function @xmath69 and a frame homomorphism @xmath70 , if @xmath71 .",
    "topological systems and continuous maps between them form a category , which we write as @xmath72 .    in order to fuzzify topological systems",
    ", we need to fuzzify the relation `` @xmath61 . ''",
    "however , the requirement imposed on the relation of satisfaction is too severe when dealing with fuzzy structures .",
    "indeed , in some reasonable categorical models of fuzzy structures ( see , for example  @xcite ) , the authors use a weaker condition where the e quivalence operator is replaced by an implication operator .",
    "thus we suggest that the corresponding condition for morphisms of fuzzy topological systems should become @xmath73 .",
    "a _ fuzzy topological system _ is a triple @xmath74 , where @xmath22 is a set , @xmath23 is a frame and @xmath75 a binary fuzzy relation such that :    * if @xmath56 is a finite subset of @xmath23 , then @xmath76 * if @xmath56 is any subset of @xmath23 , then @xmath77 * @xmath78 and @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .    to see that fuzzy topological systems also form a category we need to show that given morphisms @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the obvious composition @xmath83 is also a morphism of fuzzy topological systems .",
    "but we know @xmath3 is a category and conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) do not apply to morphisms .",
    "identities are given by @xmath84 .",
    "the collection of objects of @xmath3 that are fuzzy topological systems and the arrows between them , form the category @xmath85 , which is a subcategory of @xmath3 .",
    "any topological system @xmath67 is a fuzzy topological system @xmath86 , where @xmath87    consider the first property of the relation `` @xmath61 '' @xmath65 this will be translated to @xmath88 the inequality is in fact an equality since whenever @xmath62 , @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , we can transform this condition into the following one @xmath90 a similar argument holds true for the second property .",
    "the following result is based on the previous one :    the category of topological systems is a full subcategory of @xmath3 .    obviously , it is not enough to provide generalization of structures ",
    "one needs to demonstrate that these new structures have some usefulness .",
    "the following example gives an interpretation of these structures in a `` real - life '' situation .",
    "vickers  @xcite gives an interesting physical interpretation of topological systems .",
    "in particular , he considers the set @xmath22 to be a set of programs that generate bit streams and the opens to be assertions about bit streams . for exanple ,",
    "if @xmath63 is a program that generates the infinite bit stream 010101010101  and `` * * starts * * 01010 '' is an assertion that is satified if a bit stream starts with the digits `` 01010 '' , then this is expressed as follows : @xmath91 assume now that @xmath92 is a program that produces bit streams that look like the following one        the individuals bits are not identical to either `` 1 '' or `` 0 , '' but rather similar to these .",
    "one can speculate that these bits are the result of some interaction of @xmath92 with its environment and this is the reason they are not identical .",
    "then , we can say that @xmath92 satisfies the assertion `` * * starts * * 01010 '' to some degree , since the elements that make up the stream produced by @xmath92 are not identical , but rather similar .",
    "it is not difficult to map fuzzy topological systems to fuzzy topological spaces ( for an overview of the theory of fuzzy topologies see  @xcite ) .",
    "the following definition shows how to map an open to fuzzy set :    assume that @xmath93 , where @xmath74 is a fuzzy topological space .",
    "then the _ extent _ of an open @xmath64 is a function whose graph is given below : @xmath94    the collection of all fuzzy sets created by the extents of the members of @xmath59 correspond to a fuzzy topology on @xmath23 .",
    "assume that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are opens and let @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97",
    ". then @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "in different words , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which implies that @xmath102 that is @xmath103 . similarly , assume that @xmath104 is a collection of opens such that @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the fact that there is one @xmath107 , while for all other @xmath108 it holds that @xmath109 , implies that @xmath110 , that is , @xmath111 .",
    "finally , the last conditions generate the sets @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "so , the opens form a fuzzy topology on @xmath23 .",
    "in section  [ basic : notions ] we described the categorical products and coproducts of any two objects of @xmath3 . given two fuzzy topological systems @xmath114 and @xmath115 , their topological product is the space @xmath50 . since @xmath23 and @xmath57 are frames it is necessary to modify the definition of @xmath116 and , consequently , the definition of @xmath117 .",
    "assume that @xmath114 and @xmath115 are two fuzzy topological systems .",
    "then their topological product @xmath118 is the system @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the tensor product of the two frames @xmath23 and @xmath57 ( see  @xcite for details ) and @xmath117 is defined as follows : @xmath121    obviously , the topological product is not the same as the categorical product .",
    "the topological sum is more straigthtforward :    assume that @xmath114 and @xmath115 are two fuzzy topological systems .",
    "then their topological sum @xmath122 is the system @xmath123 , where @xmath117 is defined as follows : @xmath124    comparing the topological sum with the categorical sum reveals that they are identical .",
    "we have simply started thinking about the possibilities of using dialectica - like models in the context of fuzzy topological structures .",
    "much remains to be done , in particular we would like to see if a framework based on an implicational notion of morphism like ours can cope with embedding several of the other notions of fuzzy sets considered by rodabaugh  @xcite",
    ". also seems likely that we could extend the work of solovyov  @xcite on variable - basis topological spaces using similar ideas .",
