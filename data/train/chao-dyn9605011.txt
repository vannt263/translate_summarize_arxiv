    "the forecast of the behavior of a system when its evolution law is known , is a problem with an obvious interest in many fields of scientific research . roughly speaking , within this problem two main areas of investigation",
    "may be identified :    \\a ) the definition of the `` predictability time '' .",
    "if one knows the initial state of a system , with a precision @xmath0 , what is the maximum time @xmath1 within which one is able to know the system future state with a given tolerance @xmath2 ?",
    "\\b ) the understanding of the relaxation properties . what is the relation between the mean response of a system to an external perturbation and the features of its unperturbed state @xcite ? using the terminology of statistical mechanics , one wants to reduce `` non equilibrium '' properties , such as relaxation and responses , to `` equilibrium '' ones , such as correlation functions @xcite .    a remarkable example of type-@xmath3 problem is the weather forecasting , where one has to estimate the maximum time for which the prediction is enough accurate . as an example of type-@xmath4 problem , of geophysical interest , one can mention a volcanic eruption which induces a practically instantaneous change in the temperature . in this case",
    "it is relevant to understand how the difference between the atmospheric state after the eruption and the hypothetical unperturbed state without the eruption evolves in time . in practice one",
    "wants to understand how a system absorbs , on average , the perturbation @xmath5 of a certain quantity @xmath6  _",
    "e.g. _ the temperature  just looking at the statistical features , as correlations , of @xmath6 in the unperturbed regime .",
    "this is the so called fluctuation / relaxation problem @xcite .",
    "as far as problem-@xmath3 is concerned , in the presence of deterministic chaos , a rather common situation , the distance between two initially close trajectories diverges exponentially : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the maximum lyapunov exponent of the system @xcite . from ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "it follows : @xmath9 since the dependence on @xmath10 and @xmath11 is very weak , @xmath1 appears to be proportional to the inverse of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "we stress however that ( [ eq:2 ] ) is just a naive answer to the predictability problem , since it does not take into account the following relevant features of the chaotic systems :    \\i ) the lyapunov exponent is a global quantity , _",
    "i.e. _ it measures the average exponential rate of divergence of nearby trajectories .",
    "in general there are finite - time fluctuations of this rate , described by means of the so called _ effective _ lyapunov exponent @xmath12 .",
    "this quantity depends on both the time delay @xmath13 and the time @xmath14 at which the perturbation acted @xcite .",
    "therefore the predictability time @xmath1 fluctuates , following the @xmath15-variations @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) in systems with many degrees of freedom one has to understand how a perturbation grows and propagates trough the different degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can be interested in the prediction on certain variables , _",
    "e.g. _ , those associated with large scales in weather forecasting , while the perturbations act on a different set of variables , _",
    "e.g. _ , those associated to small scales .",
    "\\iii ) if one is interested into non - infinitesimal perturbations , and the system possess many characteristic times , such as the eddy turn - over times in fully developed turbulence , then @xmath1 is determined by the detailed mechanism of propagation of the perturbations through different degrees of freedom , due to nonlinear effects . in particular , @xmath1 may have no relation with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "in addition to these points , when the evolution of a system is ruled by a set of differential equations , @xmath16 which depend periodically on time , @xmath17 one can have a kind of `` seasonal '' effect , for which the system shows an alternation , roughly periodic , of low and high predictability",
    ". this happens , for example , in the recently studied case of stochastic resonance in a chaotic deterministic system , where one observes a roughly periodic sequence of chaotic and regular evolution intervals @xcite .",
    "as far as problem - b is concerned , it is possible to show that in a chaotic system with an invariant measure @xmath18 , there exists a relation between the mean response @xmath19 after a time @xmath13 from a perturbation @xmath20 , and a suitable correlation function @xcite .",
    "namely , one has the following equation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 equation ( [ eq : fluri ] ) ensures that the mean relaxation of the perturbed system is equal to some correlation of the unperturbed system .",
    "of course since , in general , one does not know @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluri ] ) provides only a qualitative information .    in this paper",
    "we discuss how one has to reformulate the predictability problem , both of type @xmath3 and of type @xmath4 , for systems where the `` seasonal '' effects are important , _",
    "i.e. _ , when some relevant characteristic times change , in a substantial way , periodically in time .    in section [ sec : frame ]",
    "we discuss how to approach the predictability problem in systems with time periodic evolution laws .",
    "section [ sec : toym ] is devoted to the study of a toy model whose behavior , in spite of the simplicity of the model , catches the basic features of a system with seasonal effects . in section [ sec : numsim ] we show the results of numerical experiments , that illustrate the relevance of the concepts introduced in section [ sec : frame ] .",
    "we consider systems in which one can identify two time - scales : the first , that we call @xmath23 , can be thought as due to the coupling with an external time - dependent driver ; the second , an `` internal '' time - scale @xmath24 , characterizes the system in the limit of a constant external coupling , that we call the `` stationary limit '' . in the following",
    ", the external time dependence will be assumed periodic with period @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 .",
    "if the system , in the stationary limit , is chaotic , one can take as the internal time - scale the lyapunov time , _",
    "i.e. _ , the inverse of the maximum lyapunov exponent , @xmath27 .    in the case",
    "@xmath28 one can assume that the system is adiabatically driven through different dynamical regions , so that on observation times short with respect to the long external time , it evolves on a local ( in time ) attractor .",
    "if during its tour across the slowly changing phase space the system visits regions where the effective lyapunov exponents are enough different , then the system shows up sensibly different predictability times , that may occur regularly when the driver is time - periodic .",
    "consider , for instance , a slight modification of the lorenz model @xcite , which is the first geophysical dynamical system where deterministic chaos has been observed : @xmath29 where the control parameter has a periodic time variation : @xmath30 since this model describes the convection of a fluid heated from below between two layers whose temperature difference is proportional to the rayleigh number @xmath31 , the periodic variations of @xmath31 roughly mimic the seasonal changing on the solar heat inputs .",
    "when @xmath32 is close to the threshold @xmath33 , where in the standard lorenz model a transition takes place from stable fixed points to a chaotic attractor , and the amplitude @xmath3 of the periodic forcing is such that @xmath34 oscillates below and above @xmath35 , a good approximation of the solution for very large @xmath25 , may be given by @xmath36 which is obtained from the fixed points of the standard lorenz model by replacing @xmath31 with @xmath34 .",
    "the stability of this solution is a rather complicated issue , which depends on the values of @xmath32 , @xmath3 , and @xmath25 .",
    "it is natural to expect that if @xmath32 is larger than @xmath35 the solution is unstable . in this case , for @xmath3 large enough ( at least @xmath37 ) one has a mechanism similar to stochastic resonance in bistable systems with random forcing @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath25 is crucial : for large @xmath25 the systems behaves as follows .",
    "if @xmath38 are the times at which @xmath39 , one can naively expect that for @xmath40  when @xmath34 is smaller than @xmath35  the system is stable and the trajectory is close to one of the two solutions ( [ eq : l5 ] ) , while for @xmath41  when @xmath42  both solutions ( [ eq : l5 ] ) are unstable and the trajectory relaxes toward a sort of `` adiabatic '' chaotic attractor .",
    "the chaotic attractor smoothly changes at varying of @xmath31 above the threshold @xmath35 , but if @xmath25 is large enough this dependence in first approximation can be neglected . when @xmath34 becomes again smaller than @xmath35 , the",
    "`` adiabatic '' attractor disappears and , in general , the system is far from the stable solutions ( [ eq : l5 ] ) ; but it relaxes toward them , being attractive . if the half - period is much larger than the relaxation time , in general , the system follows one of the two regular solutions ( [ eq : l5 ] ) for @xmath43 .",
    "however , there is a small but non - zero probability that the system has no enough time to relax to ( [ eq : l5 ] ) and its evolution remains chaotic .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the time evolution of the variable @xmath44 , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , in the cases @xmath47 ( a ) and @xmath48 ( b ) .",
    "they provide an unambiguous numerical evidence that the jumps from the chaotic to the regular behavior ( and the contrary ) are well synchronized with @xmath34 , with probability close to @xmath49 when the forcing period @xmath25 is very long ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]  b ) . on the other hand , for small value of @xmath25",
    "the system often does not perform the transition from the chaotic to the regular behavior , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]  a.    it is worth stressing that the system is chaotic . in both cases ,",
    "in fact the first lyapunov exponent is positive .",
    "it is rather clear from this example that the lyapunov exponent is not able to characterize the above behavior , since it just refers to a very long time property of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ , a property involving times longer than @xmath25",
    ". a more useful and detailed information can be obtained by computing a `` local '' average of the exponential rate of divergence for initially close trajectories . by this we mean an average which explicitly depends on the time @xmath50 , modulus the external period @xmath25 , to test the behavior of the system in the different states of the external driver . in this way",
    "one can make evident different behaviors , if any , of the system .",
    "we therefore define the mean effective lyapunov exponent , for the time @xmath51 $ ] and for a delay @xmath13 , as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the local expansion rate , and @xmath54 evolves according to the linear equation @xmath55 from this definition it is clear that @xmath56 measures the growth of the distance between two trajectories that differ by @xmath57 when the external driver passes through a fixed value ( or state ) .",
    "the maximum lyapunov exponent of the system gives the global average of @xmath56 : @xmath58 if one is interested on predictability for times much smaller then @xmath25 , @xmath56 is a more appropriate quantity than @xmath8 , since it distinguishes among different regimes .",
    "for example , in the system ( [ eq : l3 ] ) discussed above , for the given values of the parameters , one has @xmath59 , but @xmath60 when @xmath61 $ ] . in the case of weather forecasting ,",
    "different values of @xmath15 for different @xmath50 , correspond to different degree of predictability during the year .",
    "as far as the response properties are concerned , we expect that in a chaotic system the hypothesis of existence of `` adiabatic '' attractors implies that a fluctuation / relaxation relation holds also as a time - local property , provided one uses correlation and response functions computed according a local , not a global , average .",
    "so besides the usual correlation function between the variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 indicates the global average , @xmath66 we introduce their correlation on a delay @xmath13 after the time @xmath51 $ ] : @xmath67 where the local average is defined as in ( [ eq:5 ] ) @xmath68 in a similar way , one can consider two different kinds of mean response function of the variable @xmath62 to a small perturbation @xmath69 : the global average response , @xmath70 and the local average response for the time @xmath50 , @xmath71 the quantity ( [ eq:12 ] ) gives the mean response , after a delay @xmath13 , to a perturbation occurred at the time @xmath14 , chosen at random , _",
    "i.e. _ , with uniform distribution in @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "we shall see that @xmath73 can be rather different , even at a qualitative level , from @xmath74 .",
    "the ideas discussed in sec . [ sec : frame ] are illustrated here by means of a simple model .",
    "consider the langevin equation @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is @xmath77-correlated white noise , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath76 is a gaussian variable with @xmath78 and the coefficient @xmath79 is a periodic function of period @xmath25 : @xmath80 we require that @xmath81 to ensure a well defined asymptotic probability distribution for the stochastic process given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we assume a slow variation of @xmath79 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath82 so that , by making an adiabatic approximation , a `` local '' probability distribution exists at any time .    without the noise term , the process described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy1 ] ) is nonchaotic .",
    "therefore the model ( [ eq : toy1 ] ) can not exhibit the full rich behaviour of chaotic systems , nevertheless it catches some of the relevant features .",
    "it is easy to see that the characteristic decay time of the local correlation @xmath83 depends on @xmath50 .",
    "this can be easily computed by using the formal solution of ( [ eq : toy1 ] ) @xmath84\\ ] ] where @xmath85\\ ] ] a straightforward calculation leads to @xmath86 where the equal - time correlation is @xmath87\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : toyf1 ] we show @xmath88 as a function of @xmath13 for @xmath89 for two different values of @xmath50 , namely @xmath90 and @xmath91 , with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the different behaviour is evident . by defining a characteristic time as the time",
    "@xmath96 it takes to have @xmath97 , we get for this case @xmath98 and @xmath99 . when starting from @xmath91 the decay is almost a factor @xmath100 faster than starting from @xmath90 .",
    "the usual global average , @xmath101 gives an average correlation function , so its characteristic decay time is not able to distinguish different regimes .",
    "moreover , while @xmath102 does not depend on the noise strength @xmath103 , @xmath104 does . in fig .",
    "[ fig : toyf1 ] we used @xmath95 .",
    "we consider now how the system responds at time @xmath105 to a perturbation done at time @xmath50 .",
    "this is described by the mean response function @xmath106 , which can be computed as follows .",
    "one takes two trajectories differing at time @xmath50 by a quantity @xmath107 , i.e. , @xmath108 for any @xmath109 , and evolving with the _ same _ realization of noise .",
    "then the local response function is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the difference between the two trajectories at time @xmath112 . both times @xmath50 and @xmath13 run over a cycle , i.e. , in the interval @xmath113 $ ] .    by making use of ( [ eq : solu ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath114 by combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : cor1 ] ) and ( [ eq : clires1 ] ) we have the fluctuations / relaxation relation @xcite @xmath115    the scenario just described remains basically valid for non - linear langevin equation .",
    "consider for example the equation @xmath116 where @xmath117 is still given by ( [ eq : at ] ) .",

    "let us recall that @xmath8 changes very slowly for @xmath31 near @xmath33 , so that a periodic variation of @xmath31 in this region is not very interesting , at least if @xmath130 for any @xmath14 .",

    "however , the agreement between @xmath141 and @xmath142 is very poor for moderate delay .",
