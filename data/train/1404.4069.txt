    "recently , three independent surveys of stellar kinematics within @xmath1 of the sun detected spatially dependent bulk motions in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the bulk motions of stars , when plotted as a function of position @xmath2 relative to the galactic midplane , have characteristics of a breathing mode perturbation with a velocity gradient of @xmath3 .",
    "this result was based on a sample of 11k main sequence stars from the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) survey , which focused on intermediate latitudes above and below the galactic midplane and galactic longitudes in the range @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a sample of 72k red - clump stars from the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) survey @xcite to map out bulk motions as a function of galactocentric radius and @xmath2 and found evidence for compressional motion outside the solar circle and rarefaction inside with peak vertical bulk velocities of @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite found similar features in their analysis of 400k f - type stars with proper motions from the ppmxl catalog @xcite and spectroscopic radial velocities from the lamost / legue survey @xcite .",
    "as stressed by @xcite , the three surveys look in different parts of the extended solar neighborhood and consider different spatial projections of the data .",
    "@xcite also found a north - south asymmetry in the number counts when plotted against @xmath2 .",
    "the number count asymmetry was confirmed by @xcite who carried out a careful analysis of the uncertainties and potential systematic effects .",
    "the number counts show a 10% ( north - south)/(north + south ) deficit at @xmath6 and an excess of about the same magnitude at @xmath7 .",
    "it is possible that the north - south asymmetries in number counts and bulk vertical motions are the result of stellar debris from a tidally disrupted satellite galaxy that is mixing in with the disk stars . @xcite",
    "considered an alternative hypothesis in which the north - south asymmetries arise from coherent oscillations of the disk itself , which were excited by a passing satellite or dark matter subhalo .",
    "eventually , the oscillations die away due to phase mixing and landau damping .",
    "the disk settles into a new equilibrium state , albeit one with a higher velocity dispersion .",
    "thus , the bulk motions seen in the data may indicate an early phase of a disk heating event .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore this hypothesis in more detail through toy model calculations and numerical simulations .",
    "a similar question was posed by @xcite in the context of the stellar velocity distribution in the solar neighborhood .",
    "detailed analyses of _ hipparcos _ data @xcite have revealed rich substructure in the local velocity distribution .",
    "there are classical moving groups , which are thought to be the stellar streams from dissolved star clusters ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "velocity - space features may arise from dynamical effects of the bar @xcite or spiral structure @xcite or they may be due to streams of stars that were tidally stripped from accreted satellite galaxies @xcite . @xcite consider a different scenario in which the `` energy kick '' from a passing satellite leaves ripples in the ( disk - plane ) velocity distribution of stars .",
    "their conjecture is that velocity - space substructure in the solar neighborhood is a manifestation of these ripples .",
    "satellites , dark matter subhalos , and globular clusters for that matter , have long been recognized as possible culprits of disk heating and thickening . in general , a massive object that passes through the disk will transfer a fraction of its orbital energy to the disk stars @xcite .",
    "satellite interactions can also cause the disk to spread out radially and develop warps and flares @xcite    satellite encounters can excite various modes in the disk such as bending modes and breathing modes @xcite .",
    "it is the latter that corresponds most closely to the velocity perturbations seen in the segue , rave , and lamost surveys .",
    "we will show that a bending mode perturbation arises when the satellite s vertical velocity is less than that of the disk stars while breathing and higher - order modes are excited when the vertical velocity of the satellite exceeds that of the stars .",
    "satellites and subhalos can also excite spiral structure and bars in stellar disks .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent review of the stellar dynamics of disk galaxies . )",
    "the seminal work of @xcite showed that the tidal interaction between a stellar disk and a companion galaxy of comparable mass can generate grand design spiral structure similar to what is seen in m51 .",
    "alternatively , multi - armed and flocculent spiral structure can arise from the continual interactions between the disk and a system of satellite galaxies and dark matter subhalos .",
    "cosmological simulations of structure formation in a @xmath8cdm universe suggest that the halos of milky way size galaxies harbour a wealth of substructure in the form of subhalos @xcite .",
    "these results motivated @xcite and @xcite to explore satellite - disk interactions for an m31-like galaxy . for their particular m31 model ,",
    "when the halo is smooth the disk remains stable against bar formation for 10 gyr and relatively weak spiral structure develops , presumably seeded by the shot noise of the n - body realization .",
    "conversely , when @xmath9 of the halo mass initially resides in compact subhalos , the disk develops prominent spiral features and forms a strong bar .",
    "similar results were found in a series of simulations by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite considered a model milky way disk that was perturbed by a single satellite galaxy .",
    "the prototype for their perturber was the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite , which is believed to have survived several orbits about the galaxy . in the @xcite simulations spiral structure",
    "emerges that is similar to the spiral structure observed in the milky way .",
    "@xcite reanalysed these simulations and found that vertical perturbations in the number density of disk particles at roughly the sun s position from the galaxy s center were also generated and qualitatively similar to those seen in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is not at all surprising that a sagittarius - like dwarf produces vertical oscillations similar to what is found in the data .",
    "the solar neighborhood is characterized by a circular speed about the galactic center of @xmath10 ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) and a stellar surface density of @xmath11 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "stars in the disk have vertical velocities in the range of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a satellite with a comparable surface density to that of the solar neighborhood , with an orbit that is matched to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , and with a vertical velocity through the midplane in resonance with the vertical motions of disk stars will produce the strongest perturbations .    in section 2 , we review earlier discussions of disk heating and thickening and then present a simple toy - model calculation for the excitation of bending and breathing modes . in section 3 ,",
    "we present results from one - dimensional n - body simulations that support the toy - model calculation and also illustrate the potentially long - lived nature of the oscillations .",
    "we provide preliminary results from fully self - consistent 3d n - body simulations of satellite - disk encounters in section 4 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and give concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "this section focuses on the physics of bending and breathing mode perturbations of a stellar disk .",
    "we begin with a heuristic discussion that makes contact with the previous work of disk heating and thickening .      in an early paper on disk heating ,",
    "@xcite calculated the transfer of energy to a stellar disk from a passing satellite by treating the disk stars as free particles that are scattered in the keplerian potential of the satellite .",
    "the satellite loses energy via dynamical friction @xcite and it is this energy that heats the disk .    consider a satellite of mass @xmath13 that passes through the disk with speed @xmath14 at an angle @xmath15 relative to the disk normal as measured in the lsr . for illustrative purposes , we focus on stars initially in the plane that contains the satellite s orbit and the disk normal .",
    "following @xcite , we ignore the random motion of the stars with respect to the lsr .",
    "the impact parameter for a star - satellite scattering event is @xmath16 where the @xmath17 is the position of the star relative to the point at which the satellite passes through the galactic midplane .",
    "the change in the vertical component of the star s velocity is then @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the impact parameter that leads to scattering by @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath21 as a measure of bending and breathing mode perturbations we define @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the small and large impact parameter limits we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 thus , both breathing and bending modes are excited by a passing satellite .",
    "the previous calculations ignore the epicyclic motions of stars in the vertical direction .",
    "stars near the galactic midplane , where the gravitational potential @xmath26 is approximately quadratic in the vertical direction , oscillate about the midplane with frequency @xmath27 stars whose orbits take them further from the midplane oscillate with a frequency @xmath28 . @xcite calculated the change in vertical energy of a star due to the _ tidal field _ from the passing satellite in the _ impulse _ approximation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they averaged over satellite directions and found @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the characteristic vertical energy for stars in the disk , @xmath32 and the function @xmath33 is unity for @xmath34 and is exponentially small for @xmath35 .    by focusing on the tidal field ,",
    "@xcite pick out the breathing and higher order modes .",
    "when the satellite velocity is high , @xmath36 as in the free - particle approximation ( eq.[eq : breathelimit ] with @xmath37 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the time scale for a satellite to pass through the disk is long as compared to @xmath38 , then the interaction between the satellite and star will be adiabatic and the energy transfer will be exponentially small .",
    "the energy transfer peaks when @xmath39 ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) , that is , when the satellite is in resonance with the stellar orbit .",
    "note that the above equations ignore the finite size of the satellite in calculating the stellar orbits .",
    "the perturbing force due to a real satellite will be _ softened _ inside a characteristic scale radius @xmath40 . in general @xmath41 where @xmath42 is",
    "the central velocity dispersion of the satellite and @xmath43 is a constant of order unity",

    "whereas for a point mass perturber , @xmath47 is nonzero and constant for @xmath46 , as in eq.[eq : bendlimit ] .",
    "the change in vertical energy of a star due to a perturbing vertical force @xmath48 is @xmath49 in both @xcite and @xcite , the change in vertical energy of a star is approximated as @xmath50 . in other words , they assume that @xmath51 in eq.[eq : workenergy ] is generated entirely by @xmath48 .",
    "the function @xmath52 introduced by @xcite is a crude way of accounting for the orbital motion . if the time scale for the satellite to pass through the disk is long as compared to the orbital period , then the integral on the right hand side of eq.[eq : workenergy ] approaches zero .",
    "our interest here is in the details of the vertical perturbations that are excited by a passing satellite ; what modes are excited by a passing satellite and what is their subsequent evolution ? in the sections that follow , we address these questions numerically . here , we discuss the excitation of vertical perturbations under the assumption that the perturbations are small .",
    "we can then approximate eq.[eq : workenergy ] by substituting the unperturbed orbit for @xmath53 for @xmath54 inside the integral .",
    "this prescription resembles the born approximation that is used to calculate scattering amplitudes in quantum mechanics .",
    "the isothermal plane @xcite provides a simple equilibrium model for the vertical phase space structure of a stellar disk . in this model ,",

    "as discussed above , the coupling between a satellite and the vertical modes of the galactic disk in the solar neighborhood is governed by the relative in - plane motions of the satellite and the lsr , the match between the satellite s vertical velocity and the vertical epicyclic motions of solar neighborhood stars , and the mass and concentration of the satellite . @xcite",
    "used numerical simulations to show that the sagittarius dwarf galaxy could have induced wavelike perturbations as it plunged through the stellar disk .",

    "these perturbations are sheared by the differential rotation of the disk and continue to oscillate and reverberate for many 100 s of myr .",

    "@xcite followed the evolution of a disk - bulge - halo galaxy in which the halo comprises a smooth component with an nfw profile @xcite and a system of 100 subhalos .",
    "for the parent galaxy they used the self - consistent equilibrium model of m31 from @xcite labelled m31a .",

    "one of the most striking results from the @xcite simulation is the formation of a strong bar at about @xmath216 ( see , also @xcite ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : gauthier ] , we show the surface density and breathing mode strength at @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "the length of the bar is @xmath219 as can be seen in the upper right panel of figure [ fig : gauthier ] and figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "prominent spiral structure also develops and indeed , appears to be a precursor to the formation of the bar .",
    "though there is some disk heating during the first @xmath220 the most significant heating and thickening occurs after the bar forms ( see @xcite for a further discussion ) .",
    "by contrast , no bar and only weak spiral structure develops in the control experiment , which assumes a smooth halo .",
    "evidently , satellites and subhalos provoke spiral structure and bar formation ( see also @xcite ) .    , which is prior to the formation of the bar while the right panels show the galaxy at @xmath218 , which is well after the bar has formed .",
    "the top panels show the logarithmic grey - scale maps of the density .",
    "the middle panels show the bending mode strong in units of @xmath221 while the bottom panels show the breathing mode strength in units of @xmath193.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is not at all surprising that system of subhalos also excites vertical oscillations in the stellar disk . bending and breathing mode perturbations",
    "are found across the disk and throughout the simulation , as can be seen in the middle and lower panels of figure [ fig : gauthier ] .",
    "prior to bar formation there are strong large - scale bending modes across the disk with amplitudes on the order of @xmath222 .",
    "the breathing modes have a somewhat smaller amplitude ( @xmath223 ) and vary on smaller scales . at later times , after the bar has formed , the bending mode perturbations have diminished . moreover , in the inner parts of the galaxy , the breathing mode mirrors the bar .",
    "thus , while subhalos may have triggered the formation of the bar , it is the bar that generates and maintains compression and rarefaction motions in the inner galaxy .",
    "of course , the sun sits well beyond the region of the bar and it is therefore unlikely that the bar could cause the bulk motions seen in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the implications of spatially dependent bulk motions perpendicular to the galactic disk were highlighted by @xcite in his seminal work on the structure of the galactic disk .",
    "oort s aim was to determine the potential @xmath119 from the local stellar density and velocity distribution .",
    "he based his analysis on the assumption that the local distribution of stars is in equilibrium . to test the assumption",
    ", he computed the mean vertical velocity for stars in four separate bins : @xmath224 and @xmath225 but did not find evidence for systematic motions , a result that he notes `` lends some support to the assumption  that in the @xmath2-direction the stars are thoroughly mixed '' @xcite .",
    "turning oort s argument around , the detection of bulk vertical motions by the sdss / segue , rave , and lamost surveys suggests that the local galactic disk is not in equilibrium in the @xmath2-direction .    in this paper , we considered the hypothesis that the observed bulk vertical motions were generated by a passing satellite or dark matter subhalo .",
    "the idea that dark matter , in one form or another , might be responsible for heating and thickening the disk dates back to the 1980 s .",
    "@xcite calculated disk heating by a dark halo of supermassive black holes while @xcite considered dark matter in the form of @xmath226 dark clusters .",
    "in essence , our hypothesis is that the bulk motions seen in the data represent the early stages of a disk heating event .",
    "our focus has been to explore the theoretical aspects of disk - satellite interactions .",
    "we found that the nature of the perturbations is controlled largely by the satellite s vertical velocity relative to the disk .",
    "in particular , a slow moving ( as measured in the lsr ) satellite induces a bending mode perturbation . with a higher vertical velocity ,",
    "higher order modes , such as the breathing mode , are excited .",
    "thus , if a satellite is indeed responsible for the bulk vertical motions seen in the solar neighborhood , this its vertical velocity through the disk would likely have been @xmath227 .",
    "moreover , its surface density would have to be comparable to that of the disk in order to produce an appreciable perturbation .",
    "the model satellites considered by @xcite satisfy these conditions and so it is not surprising that they found vertical perturbations in the disk that were qualitatively similar to what was found in the data .",
    "single satellite simulations show that after a localized breathing mode perturbation is produced , it is sheared by the differential rotation of the disk .",
    "after several orbital periods of the disk , the perturbation assumes on a spiral - like pattern .",
    "the situation is more complicated with a population of satellites and it may be difficult to disentangle initial perturbations from the accumulated long - lived perturbations .    our analysis , and that of @xcite suggest that stars on the tail of the energy distribution are most responsive to a breathing mode perturbation .",
    "though our analyses focused on single - component disks , it may well be that the vertical motions is a property more of the thick disk stars , than the thin disk stars .",
    "it is well known that the vertical velocity dispersion and scale height are anti - correlated with metallicity ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the arguments presented in this paper suggest that bulk motions should be more prominent in the low metallicity / high @xmath65 populations .",
    "a related issue is radial migration .",
    "@xcite argued that spiral waves can change the angular momenta , and hence galactocentric radii , of individual stars by @xmath22850% . in analysing the cosmological simulations of disk formation by @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that satellite interactions can also drive radial migration .",
    "moreover , radial migration can bring high dispersion stars from the inner disk to the solar neighborhood , and , as discussed above , these are the stars most susceptible to a recent satellite interaction .",
    "there are twenty - five known satellites of the milky way . moreover , in a @xmath8cdm cosmology , the dark halo of a milky way - size galaxy is expected to harbour many more nonluminous subhalos @xcite .",
    "thus , it is likely that the galactic disk has been continually perturbed over its lifetime . in principle , observations of bulk motions in the stellar disk could provide a probe of the subhalo distribution . to do so will require a suite of simulations where the slope and amplitude of the subhalo mass function are varied .",
    "over the next few years , gaia will provide an unprecedented snapshot of the galaxy by making astrometric , spectral , and photometric observations of approximately one billion milky way stars ( see , for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this data set will yield a more accurate and complete map of bulk motions in the stellar disk . by bringing together these observations , theoretical analysis , and n - body simulations",
