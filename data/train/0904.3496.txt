    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) has opened a new era in the study of white dwarfs by making it possible to study these stars within globular clusters for the first time .",
    "early hst observations revealed handfuls of white dwarfs in several clusters ; since then , extensive cooling sequences comprising hundreds of white dwarfs have been observed in nearby clusters  e.g . , @xcite .",
    "the advantages of studying a population of stars all at the same , well - known distance can thus be brought to bear on the study of the final stage of evolution of low - mass stars .    as the second - nearest globular cluster to the sun , and",
    "one with a well - constrained reddening @xcite , ngc  6397 is particularly favorable for the study of white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "early hst wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) observations revealed a narrow sequence of stars whose position was consistent with carbon - oxygen wds ( co  wds ) of a single mass in the range 0.5 - 0.6  @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite have measured the distance and age of the cluster by detecting the bottom of the wd sequence , and @xcite have found evidence for natal kicks among co  wds in the cluster .",
    "both studies make use of deep hst / acs imaging of a field outside the half - mass radius @xcite .",
    "ngc  6397 is also the nearest apparently core - collapsed globular cluster @xcite .",
    "it has a small , resolved core of uncertain radius ( @xmath6  at 95% confidence@xcite ) surrounded by a power - law `` cusp '' region extending out to 100@xcite .",
    "a wide variety of objects whose origins are thought to be linked to its high central density and resulting high rate of stellar interactions have been discovered in this central cusp region .",
    "these include numerous blue stragglers @xcite , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) @xcite , a quiescent low - mass x - ray binary @xcite , and a millisecond pulsar ( msp ) @xcite .",
    "a recent addition to the growing list of stellar exotica in ngc  6397 is a set of faint blue stars thought to be low - mass white dwarfs with helium cores ( he  wds ) .",
    "the first three of these were found serendipitously in a search for cvs using hst / wfpc2 @xcite .",
    "dubbed `` non - flickerers , '' they showed neither the short - term variability nor the uv excess typical of cvs .",
    "three more candidates were found in a subsequent wfpc2 study that included  imaging ; all six candidates were found to be -faint , consistent with their proposed classification as he  wds @xcite .",
    "the one candidate for which a spectrum has been obtained ( nf2 ) revealed a broad line that confirmed its identity as a low - mass white dwarf @xcite .",
    "helium - core wds have the potential to provide new insight into a cluster s population of binary stars ",
    "stars that play a critical role in globular cluster dynamics @xcite .",
    "the six he  wd candidates identified in ngc  6397 as of 2001 are confined to the central 30  of the cluster , a distribution that strongly suggests the presence of unseen binary companions @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of nf2 , with its apparently doppler - shifted  line , also hints at the influence of a dark , compact companion @xcite .",
    "double - degenerate he wd binaries are of additional interest as potential progenitors of am  cvn stars @xcite and sources of gravitational radiation @xcite .    in the field , he  wds are commonly found in binary systems , typically in ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( ulxbs ; @xcite and references therein ) , as companions to msps @xcite or in double - wd systems @xcite . in globular clusters , eight he  wds have been identified other than those in ngc  6397 .",
    "three are in ultra - compact x - ray binaries  in ngc  6712 @xcite , ngc  6624 @xcite and m15 @xcite .",
    "three are companions to msps  in 47  tuc @xcite , ngc  6752 @xcite and m4 @xcite . in m4 a second he  wd has been found as the companion to a subdwarf b star @xcite , while in 47  tuc a second was identified recently in a spectroscopic study of blue stars @xcite .    from an evolutionary point of view",
    ", the connection to binarity follows from the need to prevent helium ignition at the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb)otherwise a co  wd will result , as for single stars . if a giant s envelope is removed before helium ignition , then the degenerate core will be exposed and produce a low - mass white dwarf with a helium core .",
    "removal of the envelope may be accomplished either via roche - lobe overflow onto a pre - existing close binary companion @xcite or a collision between an rgb star and a compact object , leading to a common envelope phase followed by envelope ejection @xcite .",
    "either way , the he  wd is left in a binary .",
    "he  wds can also form from single stars if they can somehow lose an unusually large amount of mass while on the rgb @xcite . however , as we will show , the radial distribution of the he  wds in ngc 6397 strongly suggests that they have binary companions , making such scenarios unlikely to apply in this case .    here",
    "we use the advanced camera for surveys wide field channel ( acs / wfc ) to study the central regions of ngc  6397 in more detail .",
    "our primary focus in the present paper is on the he  wds . with the wider field of view ,",
    "improved spatial resolution , and greater sensitivity of acs / wfc relative to wfpc2 , we probe a larger region of the cluster to fainter magnitudes , and uncover a much larger population of he  wds than was previously known .",
    "future papers will provide a complete analysis of the full data set and report on our search for optical counterparts of chandra x - ray sources in these data ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) .",
    "our use of the  and 625  filters also enables us to test for the presence or absence of an  absorption line in the atmospheres of the co  wds in the wfc field and thus to classify them as either of the da ( hydrogen atmosphere ) or non - da type .",
    "the relative numbers of da vs.  non - da wds in globular clusters is of significant interest in view of recent findings that the incidence of non - da stars appears to be much lower in open clusters than in the field @xcite , and outstanding questions about the mechanisms that give rise to these differences ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the possibility that the deficit of non - da stars in open clusters may be explained as a result of the larger masses of open - cluster wds @xcite can be tested by observing globular - cluster wds , whose masses are similar to those of field wds .",
    "all wds for which classifications have been made in globular clusters have been found to be das @xcite .",
    "however the number classified to date is small ( 4 - 5 in each of two clusters ) owing to the difficulty of spectroscopic observations of such faint stars in crowded fields .    finally , we determine a distance to ngc  6397 using 300 of the best - measured co  wds , together with a co  wd model cooling track kindly provided by and transformed to the hst / acs filter system by p.  bergeron @xcite .",
    "we describe the data set , together with the photometric analysis and calibration method , in  2 . in ",
    "3 we identify he  wd candidates using color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "we then consider other possible explanations for stars appearing in the parts of the cmds occupied by the he  wd candidates . in ",
    "4 we compare the co  wds to theoretical cooling tracks in a  vs.  625  cmd to distinguish da from non - da wds , and discuss the significance of our finding that most , and perhaps all , of the co  wds are of the da class . in  5 we present our distance determination . in ",
    "6 , we analyze the spatial , mass , and age distributions of the he  wds , and use the results to glean information about the nature of their binary companions , the orbital periods of their progenitor binaries , and the binary fraction in the cluster .",
    "we also compare our results to predictions made by @xcite regarding the he  wds in ngc  6397 .",
    "we summarize our results in  7 .",
    "we obtained images using the acs / wfc comprising a total of five short and five long exposures each in the f435w and f625w filters ( hereafter  and 625 ) and 40 long exposures in the f658n filter ( hereafter ) .",
    "ten single - orbit visits were made over the course of a year beginning 2004 july 16 . during each visit ,",
    "one short and one long exposure were taken in either  ( 13  s and 340  s ) or 625  ( 10  s and 340  s ) , followed by four 390  s or 395  s exposures in . due to the changing roll angle of the telescope over the course of the year , a mosaic constructed from all of the images in a given filter results in the pinwheel shape seen in figure 1 .",
    "the mosaic provides complete coverage out to a radius of 15 from the cluster center , partial coverage in two or more exposures out to 25 , and partial coverage in at least one exposure out to 29 . for comparison ,",
    "the half - mass radius of ngc  6397 is 233 @xcite .",
    "photometry was carried out using the techniques developed by j.  anderson that use an `` effective '' point - spread function ( psf ) approach to model how the psf varies with position on the acs / wfc detector .",
    "these methods are described by @xcite and applied to the wfc by @xcite .",
    "we constructed effective psfs for each of the three filters from the present data set using a subset of bright , well - measured stars in each filter .    to generate a star list that would be close to complete while also excluding most artifacts , we began by finding peaks in each individual flt - format image .",
    "we then transformed all coordinates to a common reference frame and looked for matches within 0.5 pixels . in  and",
    "625 , objects that created significant peaks in at least three of the five images were considered potential stars . in  a larger number of matches was required , depending on the number of images in which the star could potentially have appeared ( up to 40 ) .",
    "multiple passes of star - finding were made ; during each pass , the stars found in the previous pass were removed , and additional stars were searched for in the subtracted images . when finding fainter stars , we used the method described by @xcite to avoid false detections due to the ` knotty ' psfs and diffraction spikes associated with bright stars .",
    "the final collated list contained 25,004 stars .    for stars with 625  @xmath7 18.5",
    ", we measured magnitudes in each individual frame and then averaged together the results .",
    "this worked well for bright stars which make strong peaks in all images in which they appear . for stars bright enough to saturate in all the long exposures we adopted magnitudes derived from averages of the short exposures instead .",
    "so as to obtain a complete census of bright stars , magnitudes were measured even for stars that are saturated in the short exposures .",
    "saturation in the short exposures reduces the accuracy of the magnitudes measured for stars with 625  14 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "for stars with 625  @xmath8 18.5 , we combined the information from all available frames to measure a single magnitude for a given star .",
    "this produced noticeably better results for faint stars that do not necessarily produce strong peaks in every frame . by incorporating information from frames",
    "in which a given star would otherwise not have been measured , this method eliminates the bias toward brighter magnitudes that would otherwise occur for faint stars .    to calibrate the photometry we first selected one long - exposure flt image in each filter and performed pixel area map corrections .",
    "next we used daophot @xcite to measure magnitudes in 0@xmath95-radius apertures for 15 - 20 bright , unsaturated , relatively isolated stars in each filter .",
    "we converted the resulting aperture magnitudes to the vegamag system using the prescriptions provided by @xcite .",
    "we then found the offsets between these calibrated magnitudes and our instrumental magnitudes for the same stars .",
    "applying these offsets to all the instrumental magnitudes then yielded calibrated magnitudes for the entire data set on the vegamag system .",
    "in figure 2 , we show 625  vs.  and 625  vs.  color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the central regions of ngc  6397 . here",
    "we plot only stars that were detected in at least two frames in each filter ; 15,842 stars made this cut .",
    "we further required that , in each filter , a star s profile be reasonably well matched to the psf at its location using the `` @xmath10 '' quality - of - fit parameter described by @xcite ",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "this eliminated another 866 objects , leaving a final list of 14,976 stars that appear in these cmds .",
    "these are the stars that we analyze in the remainder of this paper . for stars brighter than 625  = 18.5 we plot averages of magnitudes measured in individual frames .",
    "for all fainter stars we plot magnitudes derived from simultaneous fitting .",
    "the most prominent features in these cmds are the main sequence ( ms ) and the rgb , both of which appear nearly vertical in .",
    "ngc 6397 s short blue horizontal branch , blue stragglers , and wd sequence can also be seen . in the right panel",
    ", these stars all appear to the right of the rgb or ms , consistent with the stronger  absorption lines associated with hotter stars . in  vs.  625 , the majority of the stars immediately to the left of the ms are likely to be from the halo / bulge background , while stars to the right of the ms include both foreground stars and ms - ms binaries ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    taking a closer look at the wds in the left panel , we see that they form a densely populated sequence running from 625  22 ,  0 down to 625  26 ,  1 .",
    "these are the carbon - oxygen ( co ) wds associated with single - star evolution in the cluster  stars that have turned off the main sequence within the past 2 gyr ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , one can see a group of objects that , for a given  color , lie 1 - 2 magnitudes above the co  wd sequence .",
    "these stars are well separated in color from the halo stars , most of which have  @xmath8 1 , and include the 6 stars previously identified as probable he  wds ( see fig .  3 ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "many more stars can now be seen in this region of the diagram .",
    "these stars are the primary focus of the remainder of this paper .",
    "to distinguish potential he  wds from probable co  wds we used the following procedure .",
    "we note at the outset that we do not expect to achieve a perfect separation between the two populations .",
    "our goal is to select a set of the best he  wd candidates to study in detail while also retaining for consideration marginal candidates that are less readily distinguished from the co  wds . to this end",
    "we began by interpolating a 0.53  co  wd cooling track from the @xcite models and fitting it to a subset of the wds chosen to be very likely co  wds .",
    "details of the fitting procedure are presented in  5 .",
    "a best fit was obtained for a distance of 2.34  kpc ; the resulting placement of the theoretical cooling curve is shown in the close - up of the wd region ( fig .",
    "next we selected all stars within @xmath4 0.8 magnitudes in  color of the theoretical co  wd cooling track , a region which should enclose all possible wds while excluding halo stars .",
    "for each star in this region we determined the offset between its  color and the color of the 0.53  cooling track at the same 625  magnitude .",
    "we then divided the stars into six bins : one bin for stars from 625= @xmath11 and five bins 0.5 magnitudes wide from 625  = 23.5 to 26.0 .",
    "this division produced bins with 70 - 100 stars each .",
    "next we computed the standard deviation of the color offsets within each bin . to minimize the impact of outliers ( e.g. , he  wds ) on our determination of  ( which we wished to represent  for the co  wds exclusively ) , we iterated 2 - 5 times ( until convergence ) , eliminating stars with color offsets greater than 2.5  at the end of each iteration . for a gaussian distribution of co  wd colors",
    ", this choice would eliminate 1 co  wd in each bin . finally , we defined a preliminary list of the best he  wd candidates to be stars that landed more than 3  away from the cooling track on the red side .",
    "two additional criteria were imposed before a star was put on the list of best he  wd candidates .",
    "first , we required that it be brighter than 625  = 24.5 , since measurement uncertainties increase rapidly for magnitudes fainter than this ; the possibility that additional he  wds may lie at fainter magnitudes is considered in detail below .",
    "second , we required that it be at least 0.75 mag brighter than the 0.53cooling sequence to eliminate possible double co - wds ; this last requirement eliminated two additional stars .",
    "the 24 stars that met all these criteria are marked with large open circles in fig .",
    "the six previously identified candidates @xcite are among these and are shaded grey .",
    "these 24 he  wd candidates are listed in order of increasing 625  magnitude in table  1 . for each star we provide , in columns 1 - 8 , an i d number , the x and y coordinate in our 625  mosaic , the r.a . and dec .",
    "in j2000 coordinates , the radial offset from the cluster center in arcseconds , the 625  magnitude , the  color , and the  color .    to identify probable co  wds , we followed the same procedure but used a more stringent requirement in doing the sigma clipping ( 2.25instead of 2.5 ) , which yielded slightly smaller final values of  for each bin .",
    "we then defined co  wds to be the 438 stars that lie within @xmath4 3  in any bin .",
    "these stars are marked as large black dots in fig .",
    "stars that lie between the co  wds and the best he  wd candidates or that failed to meet the two additional criteria described above were retained as marginal he  wd candidates .",
    "these 17 stars are marked with small open circles in fig .  3 and listed in the lower portion of table  1 .",
    "having defined regions in the cmd occupied primarily by co  wds vs.he  wd candidates , we wish to assess the extent to which poorly measured co  wds might be included among either the best 24 he  wd candidates or the 17 marginal ones .",
    "first we note that a close examination of the  vs.  625  cmd ( fig .",
    "3 , left panel ) reveals 6 stars in the range 625  @xmath12 that are offset to the left of the co  wd sequence by about the same amount that the marginal candidates are offset to the right of the sequence .",
    "thus it seems likely that the marginal group of 17 stars includes a few poorly measured co  wds .",
    "by contrast , the best 24 candidates have no such counterparts to the left of the sequence and are likely to be a much cleaner set .",
    "to more thoroughly assess the level of contamination among the he  wds we used artificial star tests in a manner similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "we added artificial stars into the individual images , and then reanalyzed the images using procedures identical to those used to analyze the data originally ( see  2 ) .",
    "a total of 100,000 artificial stars were introduced with magnitudes in the range 625  = @xmath13 and colors matching the 0.53  cooling sequence shown in the left panel of fig .  3 .",
    "we then used the artificial star results to construct 1000 simulated co  wd sequences by picking stars at random from the artificial stars that were recovered . for each simulated wd sequence , we extracted a number of stars equal to the number of observed co  wds and with the same luminosity function , i.e. , the same number of stars per 0.5 mag bin . in each realization",
    ", we counted how many of the artificial co  wds had landed in the regions of the cmd previously defined to contain the 24 best and 17 marginal he  wd candidates , respectively .    among the 24 best candidates ,",
    "we find that nearly all of the 18 stars with 625  @xmath7 23.5 are likely to be genuine he  wd candidates : the average number of co  wd interlopers in this region in the simulated cmds was only 0.8 @xmath4 0.8 .",
    "of the 6 stars with 625  = @xmath14 , about half may be interlopers , judging from the simulated cmds .",
    "thus roughly 20 of the 24 best candidates can not be explained as poorly measured stars ; this accords with the results of a visual inspection which revealed no sign that these stars were unusually crowded in the images . among the 17 marginal candidates ,",
    "the simulated cmds suggest that roughly half are likely to be poorly measured co  wds .",
    "we counted 2.8 @xmath4 1.7 interlopers among those with 625  @xmath7 23.5 ( vs.  9 observed ) and 1.6 @xmath4 1.2 interlopers in the range 625  = @xmath15 ( vs.  4 observed ) . for 625  @xmath8 24.5 , however , the artificial cmds produced interlopers in numbers comparable to the number of observed candidates .",
    "we conclude that few if any of the 4 faintest marginal candidates are likely to be genuine he  wd candidates .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we will focus primarily on the subset of the 24 best he  wd candidates , the vast majority of which are well - measured stars , while keeping in mind that perhaps half of the brighter marginal candidates could also be genuine he  wd candidates . before going on to analyze their properties ,",
    "however , we consider other possible explanations for the presence of stars in the region of the cmd that they occupy .",
    "we note that there is little question that they are cluster members : a uniform spatial distribution , as would be expected for a group of foreground or background objects , is definitively ruled out by their strong degree of concentration toward the cluster center ( see  6.1 ) .",
    "our preliminary look at the proper motions of these stars provides independent confirmation that nearly all are cluster members ; a full analysis of the proper motions is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we first consider the possibility that they may be cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , eleven of which are now known in ngc  6397 ( see triangles in fig .  3 ) .",
    "given that two of these cvs land in the region in the  cmd occupied by the he  wd candidates , it is natural to ask whether some of the he  wd candidates could instead be cvs ; this possibility was suggested by @xcite as a possible explanation for the three candidates identified by @xcite .",
    "one argument against this possibility is that while all the known cvs were found as counterparts to x - ray sources in chandra imaging @xcite , none of the 41 he  wd candidates identified here have x - ray counterparts down to the limit reached with existing chandra imaging (  3  @xmath16  erg  s@xmath17 ) @xcite . very few if any cvs in the field have luminosities below this limit ( @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .    a second argument against the he  wd candidates being cvs comes from comparing the locations of known cvs with the he  wd candidates in the  vs.  625  diagram ( fig .  3 , right panel )",
    "nine of the 11 cvs have  colors significantly to the left of the main sequence .",
    "this implies excess emission through the  filter , and in turn the likely presence of an  emission line ( see @xcite and @xcite for the efficacy of this method in picking out emission - line stars ) .",
    "even the two cvs that lie to the right of the ms in  are still significantly -bright compared to the wds ; comparison to the white dwarf sequence is appropriate for most of the fainter cvs , since their blue  colors imply that their broad - band spectra are dominated by the hot wd .",
    "thus all eleven of the cvs show strong evidence of having  emission lines , which is a key signature of accretion and nearly ubiquitous in cvs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , nearly all of the he  wd candidates have  colors consistent with strong  absorption lines , and very similar to those of the co  wds in the cluster . only one ( id=14 ) has an  color close to any of the known cvs .",
    "a second possibility to consider is that the he  wd candidates could instead be detached wd - ms binaries . like cvs",
    ", such binaries would naturally occupy the region between the ms and wd sequence @xcite . to explain the proximity of the candidates to the co  wd sequence in the  vs.  625  cmd , however , would require that the ms companions all have extremely low masses .",
    "combining the observed co  wd sequence with model ms stars from @xcite , we find that all but the brightest 4 he  wd candidates could be explained as co  wd / ms - star binaries only if the ms star had  0.15 .",
    "@xcite set a similar limit on the possible presence of ms companions for the three original bright candidates using multi - band wfpc2 data . that the  colors of the he  wd candidates closely resemble those of the co",
    "wds also implies that if any of the candidates were co  wds then the ms companions must contribute a small fraction of the total light of the system . as there is no reason to think that binaries in ngc  6397 should favor such low - mass companions",
    " and exchange interactions certainly would not  we conclude that it is unlikely that many of these stars are detached wd / ms binaries .",
    "use of the  filter enables us to determine whether hydrogen is present or absent in the atmospheres of both the co and he  wds we observe . in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted a db ( helium atmosphere ) cooling sequence ( thick solid line ) along with the da ( hydrogen atmosphere ) cooling sequence ( thick dash line ) .",
    "we interpolated these tracks for an assumed mass of 0.53  from the @xcite co  wd models . in the right panel ,",
    "the same two tracks are also shown shifted 0.07 magnitudes to the right ( thin lines ) for reasons that will be explained below .",
    "the da tracks span the entire range of observed magnitudes , while the db tracks begin at @xmath18k ( just below the so - called db gap@xcite ) . in",
    "( left panel ) , the da vs.  db tracks separate by at most 0.1 magnitude in color ( near 625  24)too small a separation to definitively distinguish da from db wds using the present measurements . in",
    "( right panel ) , the tracks are separated by 0.2 magnitudes in the range 625  = @xmath19 and as much as 0.4 magnitudes near 625  = 24 . thus da vs.db wds are more readily distinguished using this filter pair .",
    "note that the db tracks should be taken in this context to represent any non - da - type wds , i.e. , any wd with no  line , rather than dbs exclusively .",
    "we also note that the location of the db track to the right of the main sequence in the right panel of fig .",
    "3 is the result of these stars being significantly hotter than the stars on the lower main sequence .",
    "because the  filter is centered at @xmath20   ( i.e. , at a longer wavelength than the 625filter which is centered at @xmath21  ) , hotter stars will naturally produce lower ratios of  to 625  flux and correspondingly larger values of  even in the absence of any lines .    to determine which of the wds in ngc  6397 are likely to be da vs.non-da wds",
    ", we focused initially on the co  wds ( large solid dots in fig .",
    "3 ) and proceeded as follows .",
    "first we considered only stars brighter than 625  @xmath22 24.5 ; for these stars , the separation between the tracks in the  vs.  625  diagram is large enough relative to the spread in the measured colors of the co  wds that we can distinguish da from non - da wds ( fig .  3 , right panel ) .",
    "an inspection of this diagram reveals that nearly all of the co  wds follow the da cooling track , while there is no sign of any concentration of co  wds around the db track .",
    "this strongly suggests that the vast majority of co  wds in ngc  6397 are of the da type .",
    "we note that while the shape of the observed co  wd sequence in the  vs.  625  cmd is very similar to the shape of the theoretical co  wd track ( thick dashed line ) , there is an offset between the color of the track and the mean color of the co  wds .",
    "we estimate that the offset is 0.07 magnitudes , and surmise that it may be the result of calibration uncertainties ; shifted db and da tracks are shown as thin solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the existence of this small offset does not affect our conclusions below regarding the relative abundance of da vs.  non - da wds in the cluster . nor does it affect our measurement of the distance to the cluster ( see  5 ) which relies only on the  vs.  625  diagram .",
    "we can make a quantitative comparison between wds in ngc  6397 and those in the field by focusing on a portion of the cmd for which the da to non - da ratio in the field is known .",
    "@xcite find that in the range @xmath23 the ratio of da to non - da wds is about 4:1 .",
    "for the models we are using ( and at the distance we find  see  5 ) , this temperature range corresponds to a magnitude range of 625  @xmath24 . in this magnitude range",
    "we observe 126 co  wds , all but one of which lies closer to the da track than to the db track ; this number increases to four if we compare instead to the shifted tracks .",
    "if the da / non - da ratio matched that in the field we should have seen 25 non - da wds .",
    "the probability of finding 4 when 25 are expected is 2.310@xmath25 .",
    "thus it is clear that the ratio of da to non - da wds is considerably higher in ngc  6397 than in the field . given the likelihood of a few poor measurements among the 126 co  wds in the interval in question , it is possible that all the observed co  wds in ngc  6397 have hydrogen atmospheres .",
    "this conclusion does not depend on our assumption that the co  wd mass is 0.53 , as the position of the tracks in the  vs.  625diagram depends only very weakly on mass .",
    "for example , the 0.51cooling track lies much less than 0.01 magnitudes to the right of the 0.53  track in . because the tracks are nearly vertical in  vs.  625 , our conclusion is also largely independent of the adopted distance . changing the distance modulus by",
    "up to 0.2 magnitudes would change the  colors of the tracks by less than 0.01 magnitudes .",
    "these results demonstrate that the incidence of non - da  wds is much lower in at least one globular cluster than in the field .",
    "that more than 96% of the 126 co  wds we observe in ngc  6397 appear to have hydrogen atmospheres confirms and extends the findings of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a similar preponderance of da  wds in open clusters , and suggested that it could be the result of the higher masses of co  wds in open clusters vs.  the field . that the same phenomenon has now been seen to occur in a globular cluster , whose co  wds have masses quite comparable to those in the field ,",
    "makes it unlikely that mass could be the primary factor in determining the relative numbers of da vs.  non - da stars .",
    "our findings also illustrate the power of  imaging for efficiently classifying large numbers of wds .",
    "this is particularly valuable in globular clusters in which wds are faint and crowded by much brighter stars , making spectroscopic observations very challenging . in a single study",
    "we have increased the number of wd classifications in globular clusters by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "imaging has been validated in its ability to pick out emission - line stars ( e.g. , cvs ) through follow - up spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "further testing of the method , in the context of absorption - line stars , would be valuable to gain greater confidence that it reliably distinguishes da from non - da wds .    finally , we note that the he  wds also follow the da cooling track ( see fig .  3 , right panel ) , showing that they too have hydrogen atmospheres .",
    "independent of any comparison to theoretical tracks , their distribution is well - matched to those of the co  wds in , and like them shows no tendency to follow the db track .",
    "the only apparent difference is that the spread in  colors for the he  wd candidates seems to be somewhat larger than that for the co  wds . this could be due in part to their larger range in temperatures and masses at a given 625  magnitude relative to co  wds .",
    "we have explored the effect of these parameters , however , and find that they are unlikely to be able to fully explain the apparently larger spread ; it is unclear at present what the cause might be , if in fact it is significant .",
    "the distance to ngc 6397 has been subject to considerable uncertainty , with reported values ranging from 2.2 kpc @xcite to 2.8 kpc @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite have detected the bottom of the co  wd sequence in an off - center field in ngc  6397 and used it to determine a distance of 2.54  @xmath4  0.07  kpc ( converting from the quoted distance modulus ) and an age of 11.47@xmath40.47 gyr .",
    "here we use the @xcite theoretical wd cooling models to determine a distance by matching the models to the observed wd sequence in fig .  3 .",
    "we assume a wd mass in the range 0.53 @xmath4 0.02 , as suggested by @xcite based on the luminosities of the termination of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , the rgb tip , the horizontal branch , and post - agb stars .",
    "this mass range is also in accord with spectroscopic mass measurements of co  wds in ngc  6397 @xcite , and encompasses the mass of 0.51determined by @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "19 ) . in view of the good match between the da cooling sequence and the location of the co  wds in the  cmd ( see  4 ) , we also assume that all the co  wds are of the da type .",
    "starting with a 0.53  da wd model in the  diagram , we tested distances from @xmath26  kpc at 0.01  kpc intervals and found the best fit value as follows .",
    "first we determined extinction values in both filters assuming @xmath27 . for stars with colors of co  wds in ngc  6397 , and adopting the reddening law of @xcite , we obtained @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; these values are very weakly dependent on spectral type .",
    "we then shifted the theoretical cooling sequence to account for the distance and for the extinction in both filters .",
    "next we selected all stars within @xmath40.8 magnitudes in  color of the theoretical sequence and in the range 625  @xmath30 , excluding known cvs .",
    "we then computed the offset in  color between each of these stars and the theoretical sequence at the same 625  magnitude .",
    "to select stars likely to be co  wds , we computed the standard deviation of these color offsets ( using the bins described in  3 ) , iterating several times and removing stars with @xmath8  2  deviations at the end of each iteration .",
    "this fairly stringent requirement was imposed in order to reliably remove non - co  wds from consideration .",
    "the best fit distance was taken to be the distance that yielded a mean  color offset closest to zero .",
    "the best fit was achieved for a distance of 2.34  kpc , or an apparent distance modulus of @xmath31 ; the result is shown in both panels of fig .",
    "3 ( long - dash lines ) .",
    "the main contributions to the uncertainty in the distance come from uncertainties in the co  wd mass , the reddening , and the photometric calibration .",
    "examining the wd models , we find that a change of @xmath4 0.02  from a co  wd mass of 0.53  corresponds to a change of 0.05 in the 625  magnitude for the range of wd temperatures in question .",
    "this translates to a contribution to the uncertainty in the distance of 0.05  kpc .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath32 is 0.02 magnitudes @xcite , which translates to a uncertainties of 0.053 in @xmath33 and 0.03 in @xmath34 . rerunning the model - fitting algorithm described above using @xmath35",
    ", we find that the uncertainty in the reddening results in an uncertainty in the distance of 0.05 kpc .",
    "finally , a maximum uncertainty in the photometric calibration of up to 0.1 mag would correspond to a distance uncertainty of 0.11  kpc .    combining these contributions to the uncertainty in quadrature",
    "yields a final estimate for the uncertainty in the distance of 0.13  kpc .",
    "thus , with an assumed co  wd mass of 0.53 , we find a distance of 2.34  @xmath4  0.13  kpc .",
    "we note that our final result is in reasonable agreement with the distance determined by @xcite if we adopt their value of 0.51  for the mass of all but the very faintest co  wds ( see their fig .",
    "19 ) . in this case",
    "our distance increases to 2.39  @xmath4  0.13  kpc , which is to be compared with their value of 2.54  @xmath4  0.07  kpc .",
    "the sequence of 24 helium - core wd candidates identified here quadruples the number known in ngc  6397 .",
    "this is the first such extensive sequence of individually identified he  wds found in a globular cluster .",
    "their presence illustrates the complexity of wd sequences in gcs , which has been extensively explored by @xcite . a large population of he  wds has also been proposed to explain the total numbers and range of colors of wds observed in @xmath36 cen @xcite .",
    "our ability to identify individual he  wd candidates in ngc  6397 presents a unique opportunity to study a large group of these rare stellar remnants all at the same , well - known distance . given their connection to binary stars and/or stellar interactions , they provide a fresh window into the inner workings of a globular cluster .",
    "we begin by examining the location of the he  wd candidates in the vs.  625  cmd , comparing their magnitudes and colors to theoretical he  wd models .",
    "these he  wd models have been computed with the same code and input physics as described by @xcite , and their synthetic spectra according to @xcite .",
    "4 shows model sequences for masses ranging from 0.175 - 0.45  and z=0.0002 progenitors , a metallicity appropriate for ngc  6397 @xcite . because magnitudes ( and to a much lesser extent colors ) depend somewhat on the thickness of the remnant s hydrogen layer ( and cooling age much more so  see below ) , we have computed two sets of models characterized by different h - layer masses .",
    "models with `` thick '' envelopes ( left panel ) have h - layer masses ranging from @xmath37  for the least massive model down to @xmath38  for the 0.45  wd model .",
    "these models were obtained by assuming that binary evolution leads to stable mass transfer ; computational details can be found in @xcite . in this case",
    "mass loss from the wd progenitor ends when the envelope mass becomes small enough that an extended structure can not be supported any longer and then shrinks within the roche - lobe .",
    "models thus computed represent an upper limit to the possible h - layer thickness that a he - wd model of given mass can have . in these models , nuclear burning ( mostly through the p - p chain ) is a main source of energy along the wd cooling phase . on the other hand , `` thin '' envelope models ( fig",
    ".  4 right panel ) were obtained by modifying the envelope structure of pre - wd models in such a way as to render hydrogen nuclear burning at the base of the envelopes negligible , while keeping the total wd mass fixed . in our models , this translates into `` thin '' h - layers with masses between @xmath39  and @xmath40 .",
    "our sets of `` thick '' and `` thin '' models represent the two extremes in terms of cooling timescales for he - wd stars",
    ". they also bracket reality in terms of mass - radius relations for these stars .",
    "even thinner h - layers than those adopted in our models would not translate into noticeable smaller radii ( fainter magnitudes ) .",
    "comparison to either set of models shows that most of the 24 he  wd candidates ( large circles ) have magnitudes and colors consistent with masses in the range  0.2 - 0.3 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the mass of 0.25  determined for the one candidate for which a spectrum has been obtained ( id=2 in table 1 ; @xcite ) . comparing the two panels",
    ", we see that with thinner envelopes ( right panel ) the inferred masses shift to slightly lower values on average .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced at the bright end ( see also @xcite ) , such that the brightest candidate lands outside the region spanned by the thin - envelope models in the right panel . within the measurement uncertainties ,",
    "the remaining candidates are all within the region spanned by either set of models .",
    "this includes candidates 4 , 5 , and 6 , first identified by @xcite , whose  colors measured from wfpc2 images appeared noticeably redder than 0.2  models @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the discrepancy may be the result of a bias toward redder measured colors for stars near the detection limit in the wfpc2 observations . in both panels of fig .",
    "3 the marginal candidates ( small open circles ) lie along tracks predicted for 0.35 - 0.45  he  wds .",
    "an independent measure of the average mass of the he  wd candidates as a group can be obtained by examining their radial distribution within the cluster .",
    "the dynamical relaxation time at the half - mass radius (  = 233 ) is 3  @xmath41 years ; at the center it is less than @xmath42 years @xcite .",
    "as all the he  wd candidates are well inside the half - mass radius ( and half of the best 24 are less than 30  from the center ) , their radial distribution should reflect their masses .",
    "indeed , a high degree of mass segregation in the central regions of ngc  6397 has been well documented @xcite .    in fig .",
    "5 we plot the cumulative radial distribution of the 24 best he  wd candidates ( solid black line ) along with that of several other populations in the cluster : co  wds ( short - dash line ) , turnoff stars ( long - dash ) , blue stragglers ( dash - dot ) , and the 17 marginal he  wd candidates ( solid grey line ) .",
    "we also plot the cumulative distribution that would be expected for a spatially uniform distribution of objects ( dotted line ) . applying the kolmogorov - smirnov test to compare distributions",
    ", we find first of all that the 24 best he  wds have a 2@xmath43% chance of being drawn from a spatially uniform distribution , which definitively rules out a population of foreground or background interlopers .",
    "they are also significantly more centrally concentrated than the co  wds ( 0.02% probability of being drawn from the same population ) and main - sequence turnoff stars ( 0.2% probability ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that , on average , their masses are in excess of the turnoff mass of 0.8 .",
    "these comparisons do not take account of incompleteness , except that we excluded co  wds fainter than 625  = 24.5 ( the magnitude of faintest of the good he  wd candidates ) .",
    "the greater difficulty of detecting he  wds as compared to turnoff stars in the central regions would only make the difference in radial distribution more pronounced .",
    "of all the groups to which we compare the he  wds , they most closely resemble the blue stragglers ( 44.1% probability ) , which have a range of masses 0.8 - 2  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the 24 best he  wd candidates , the 17 marginal candidates are not nearly as concentrated to the center as the blue stragglers ( k - s probability = 0.16% of being drawn from the same population ; see fig .",
    "they most closely resemble the co  wds ( 94.3% ) , though are also compatible with turnoff stars ( 48.8% ) .",
    "the probability that these 17 stars are drawn from the same population as the 24 best candidates is only 1.0% .",
    "given the significant degree of contamination that we expect among these marginal candidates ( roughly half are likely to be poorly - measured co  wds  see  3 ) , the similarity of their radial distribution to that of the co  wds is perhaps not surprising .",
    "still , if the other half really were he  wds , and these had masses comparable to those of the 24 best candidates , one might expect a greater degree of central concentration .",
    "we conclude that either the degree of contamination is greater than we estimated or that the he  wds that do exist among these marginal candidates may not have the large dynamical masses characteristic of the 24 best candidates . in view of the uncertain status of the marginal candidates ,",
    "we hereafter focus our attention primarily on the 24 best candidates .",
    "the mismatch between photometric masses determined from the cmd and dynamical masses determined from the radial distribution for the 24 best he  wd candidates can be understood if they have binary companions of sufficient mass .",
    "such companions are expected on evolutionary grounds ( see  1 ) and earlier observations found evidence for them @xcite .",
    "here we use the measured dynamical vs.photometric masses of the he  wds to place new constraints on the nature of these companions .    given that the bulk of the he  wd candidates have photometric masses in the range 0.2 - 0.3 , whereas the dynamical masses resemble those of the much more massive blue stragglers ( @xmath44 ) , the companions must make up this large mass deficit .",
    "we note that the blue straggler mass range found by de  marco et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is based on six of the brightest blue stragglers in ngc 6397 and thus may not be representative of the entire population of 24 blue stragglers in our sample . to estimate the typical blue straggler mass , we have performed cored power - law fits to the radial distributions of turnoff stars and blue stragglers @xcite .",
    "taking these two groups to be in approximate thermal equilibrium results in a blue straggler mass of 1.2  @xmath4  0.1 . adopting this as the typical mass for the he  wd binary systems suggests a companion mass of 1 .",
    "this rules out main - sequence companions , as ms stars near the turnoff mass would dominate the light and cause the he  wd binaries to be significantly brighter and redder than is observed .",
    "co  wds with masses 0.53(like those currently being produced in the cluster ) are also ruled out , since they fall well short of the required companion mass .",
    "we have also compared the observed radial distribution of the he  wds to the expected distribution of 1.6stars ( i.e. , the dynamical mass of a he  wd binary containing a neutron star ) and find that 1.4  companions are ruled out , even when we allow for incompleteness in the he  wd distribution .",
    "thus we conclude that the required typical mass of the unseen companions of about 1  is most compatible with heavy wds .    the non - detection in x - rays of any of the 41 he  wd candidates further supports the view that the companions are white dwarfs rather than neutron stars .",
    "nss should have been spun up to become msps during the mass - transfer stage . for comparison ,",
    "the 19 msps in 47  tuc have  @xmath45 erg s@xmath17 @xcite ; if any of the he  wds in ngc  6397 had comparable msp companions they should have been seen in existing chandra imaging that reaches  3  @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "our finding that the companions are most likely to be white dwarfs is in good agreement with the conclusions of @xcite , who argue on theoretical grounds that the companions to the he  wds in ngc  6397 should be wds and not neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "a key part of their argument is that mass transfer from a 0.8  turnoff star onto a ns would be stable , whereas onto a wd it would be unstable . stable mass transfer would yield relatively wide binaries which would be vulnerable to rapid breakup in the dense environs of the center of ngc  6397 .",
    "unstable mass transfer onto a wd would instead yield tight binaries ( following a period of common - envelope evolution ) which would be more resilient .",
    "we note that the latter scenario would apply to mass transfer onto white dwarfs with mass less than 1 , but not for more massive wds  a point we will return to below .",
    "we can use cooling ages from the he  wd models to consider what the distribution of he  wds in the cmd implies about the formation rate of these stars in ngc  6397 .",
    "this in turn can provide insight into the viability of different models and/or formation scenarios .",
    "the analysis is complicated by the fact that cooling ages are highly dependent upon the assumed mass of the residual hydrogen layer , with thicker layers leading to slower rates of cooling .",
    "because thick hydrogen layers support hydrogen burning , wd evolution along the cooling sequence for thick - envelope models is completely dominated by nuclear burning on the very long timescales dictated by the pp - cycle . by contrast ,",
    "thin h envelopes render nuclear burning negligible so that for thin - envelope models , wd evolution is driven solely at the expense of the star s internal heat .",
    "the differing rates of cooling can be seen in fig .  4 by comparing the left and right panels , where `` + '' symbols are used to indicate cooling ages . in the left panel ,",
    "marked ages are @xmath46 gyr in 1-gyr intervals .",
    "in the right panel , they indicate ages of 0.001 , 0.0025 , 0.005 , 0.0075 , 0.01 , 0.025 , 0.05 , 0.075 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 1.0 , 1.25 , 1.5 , 1.75 , 2.0 , 2.25 , 2.5 , and 2.75 gyr . thus , for example , the brightest of the three he  wd candidates identified by @xcite at 625  @xmath3 22.5 has a cooling age of  8  gyr according to the thick - envelope models ( left panel ) vs.  an age of only  0.1 - 0.25  gyr according to the thin - envelope models ( right panel ) .",
    "we caution that the very youngest ages shown for the thin - envelope models ( on the order of 1  myr ) are uncertain by a factor of a few due to the fast initial rate of evolution and the somewhat ad - hoc nature of the models .    here",
    "we examine the implications of thin vs.  thick envelopes in turn .",
    "it should be emphasized that these models represent only two possible sets of h  envelope masses .",
    "however , they represent the two opposite extremes both in terms of cooling ages and mass - radius relations and thus should bracket reality .    considering the thin - envelope models first ( fig .  4 , right panel )",
    ", we see that the 24 best he  wd candidates have implied cooling ages ranging from 1  myr for the brightest candidate to about 1  gyr for the faintest .",
    "the implied formation rate is then 24  gyr@xmath17 .",
    "this is higher than the rate at which rgb stars and compact objects collide in the central regions of ngc  6397 . assuming then that the he  wds are instead the products of pre - existing binaries , the formation rate is determined by the fraction of stars that have a close white dwarf companion when they ascend the giant branch .",
    "the implied binary fraction can thus be determined by comparing the rate of formation of he  wds to the rate at which stars are turning off the main sequence in the same region . counting stars above the turnoff at 625  = 16.1 , we find 700 subgiant and red giant stars . considering the 1.5  gyr spent in these stages combined @xcite , this implies that stars are turning off the main sequence at a rate of about 470 gyr@xmath17 at the present epoch .",
    "similar rates are implied by the number of horizontal - branch stars observed ( 48 , which given a lifetime of 0.1  gyr implies a rate of 480  gyr@xmath17 ) and by the number of co  wds with ages of 1  gyr or less ( 480 after correcting for incompleteness ) .",
    "thus the implied binary fraction is 24/470 or about 5% .",
    "this is a small enough fraction that it is not surprising that the horizontal - branch and co  wd populations do not appear to be depleted by losses to he  wd formation .",
    "the 5% binary fraction required to account for the observed he  wds in the context of thin - envelope models represents a lower limit on the total binary population in the central regions of the cluster , as it accounts only for the particular class of binary that yields he  wds . the 5 - 7% binary fraction found among ms - ms binaries in the central region of the cluster by @xcite would be in addition to the he  wd progenitor binaries .",
    "the total will be less than the sum if some ms - ms binaries are themselves progenitors of the binaries that lead to the he  wds , i.e. , if a co  wd replaces one of the ms stars through an exchange collision before the other ms star turns off the main sequence ( or at least before it climbs far enough up the giant branch to fill its roche lobe ) . such exchanges are not uncommon in n - body simulations of high - density clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "interpreting the he  wds in the context of thin h - envelope models implies a binary fraction that is quite plausible .",
    "however , it does present one problem",
    ". the implied cooling ages of the brightest four candidates are very young , in the range of only 1 - 2  myr . it would be surprising to catch any he  wds so early in their evolution , even considering the factor of a few uncertainty in the cooling ages of such young objects .",
    "these stars can not just be a small number of interlopers unrelated to the cluster .",
    "three have already been shown to be proper - motion members @xcite , and our preliminary analysis shows that the fourth is as well . such young ages would imply an implausibly high rate of formation in the very recent past , nominally on the order of 2  myr@xmath17 . even taking the uncertainty in their ages into account",
    ", the present - day rate of formation would be more than an order of magnitude greater than the average rate over the past 1  gyr .",
    "the current formation rate would also have to be higher than the total rate at which stars are turning off the main sequence at present ( 0.5  myr@xmath17 ) .",
    "yet only a fraction of these turnoff stars can be members of binaries that will produce he  wds .",
    "thus it seems highly unlikely that these bright stars can be explained as he  wds with thin h envelopes .",
    "examining the cooling ages in the context of thick h - envelope models instead ( fig .  4 , left panel ) , the he  wds would have ages ranging from 1  gyr to  13  gyr . in this case , the formation rate problem for the brightest candidates disappears , owing to the much slower rate of cooling associated with thick envelopes .",
    "the implied rate of formation in the recent past is 5  gyr@xmath17 , easily compatible with a binary formation scenario , as it would require that only 1% of the stars turning off the main sequence produce he  wds in the present epoch .",
    "this rate of formation is also low enough that collisions between rgb stars and co  wds could make a significant contribution to their production .",
    "the rate is also not too different from the long - term formation rate of 2  gyr@xmath17 implied by seeing 24 he  wd candidates with ages up to 13  gyr .",
    "indeed , a moderate increase in production rate would not be surprising considering the inevitable dynamical evolution of the cluster on this timescale .    in summary",
    ", either thick or thin envelopes can explain the observations with reasonable implications for the formation rate of he  wds ( @xmath47 gyr@xmath17 ) and the binary fraction in the cluster ( @xmath1% ) .",
    "the one exception is that the brightest candidates can not be readily explained in the context of thin envelopes , as they would require an exceedingly high rate of formation in the very recent past .",
    "additional insight into the population of he  wd progenitor binaries can be gleaned by examining the distribution of he  wd masses , as inferred from their positions in the cmd .",
    "the mass of the degenerate core that will be left behind when a giant loses its envelope to a binary companion depends on how far up the rgb the giant has climbed before overflowing its roche lobe .",
    "this in turn depends on the orbital period of the binary : longer period systems , being wider , allow the giant ( and the mass of its he core ) to grow larger before the envelope is lost .",
    "the he  wd masses we deduce from the cmds are mostly rather small .",
    "all but 2 of the 24 best candidates have implied masses in the range @xmath0 .",
    "this in turn implies that the progenitor binaries have periods in the range @xmath2 days @xcite .",
    "longer - period binaries containing co  wds and ms turnoff stars or giants appear to be significantly more rare , given our finding ( see  3 ) that at most 6 of the marginal candidates with 625 = @xmath48 are likely to be genuine he  wds .",
    "irrespective of the thickness of h envelopes , the he  wd sequence comes to a relatively abrupt end near 625 24 .",
    "the dearth of he  wd candidates at fainter magnitudes is readily visible in the fig .",
    "4 cmds ( recall from  3 that our artificial star tests show that the four faintest marginal candidates are likely to be poorly measured co  wds ) . by contrast , the number of observed co  wds is continuing to rise below 625  24 . the lack of fainter he  wds can not be the result of incomplete recovery of faint stars .",
    "artificial star tests show that in the bins from 625  = @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the completeness is still 60% and 50% , respectively ( see fig .  6 , top panel ) .",
    "thus it is unlikely that any significant number of fainter he  wds is present .",
    "when we correct for incompleteness ( see fig .  6 , panels 2 - 4 ) , the co  wd luminosity function continues to rise to the limit of our observations , whereas the number of he  wds is clearly in decline .    to further examine the significance of the absence of convincing he  wd candidates below 625  24.5 , we measured the offsets in color from the 0.53 @xmath51 co  wd cooling track for each of the co  wd and he  wd candidates .",
    "shows color offset distributions for stars with 625  = @xmath52 ( left panel ) and 625  = @xmath53 ( right panel ) .",
    "the distribution of the brighter stars is clearly bimodal , with the he  wd candidates forming a peak centered 0.4 magnitudes redward of the co  wd sequence . for the fainter stars ,",
    "the color spread is larger due to growing measurement uncertainties .",
    "still , there is no sign of any excess of stars on the right side ( @xmath54 ( ) 0.3 ) where he  wds would be expected to lie .",
    "we estimate that at most 10 he  wds ( 2  upper limit ) could hide in the wings of the co  wd distribution in the magnitude range 625 = 24.5 - 26 .",
    "the significance of the termination of the he  wd sequence is different in the context of thin vs.  thick h - envelope models .",
    "if the hydrogen envelopes are thin , the sequence ends at 1  gyr , well below the age of the cluster .",
    "such a termination was predicted by @xcite , who suggested that within 1  gyr , binaries containing he  wds would either merge via gravitational - wave radiation or be broken up in exchange interactions .",
    "the he  wds , as the lowest - mass stars in most such exchanges , would typically be removed from the binary and quickly redistribute themselves according to their single - star mass . while we find that the sequence extends about one magnitude fainter than predicted by @xcite ( who suggested that none fainter than those identified by @xcite would be found in deeper searches ) , our finding agrees with their prediction within the large uncertainties in cooling age associated with the unknown h - envelope thickness . in particular , while their `` moderate '' h envelope models put the cooling age of the faintest @xcite candidate at 1  gyr , the `` thin '' h - envelope models we use here result in more rapid cooling , such that the he  wds are a magnitude fainter at 1  gyr .",
    "while our observations confirm the prediction by @xcite that the sequence should end at 1  gyr , there is still a puzzle .",
    "this prediction was made specifically for the cluster core , assuming a central mass density of 1.5@xmath55  pc@xmath56 .",
    "yet few , if any , of the he  wd candidates are actually in the cluster core , which is very small .",
    "@xcite found a core radius of @xmath6at 95% confidence , while our preliminary analysis of the present data set suggests a radius in the range @xmath57 .",
    "outside the cluster core , in the so - called `` cusp '' region , the density falls off approximately as ( r / r@xmath58)@xmath59 .",
    "given that a binary s lifetime to exchange is inversely proportional to the density , a binary that would last only 1  gyr in the core would survive more than a hubble time at just 4 . depending on the core radius , between half and all the he  wd candidates are outside 4 , where the lifetime to exchange would be even longer .",
    "thus it is not clear that the termination of the sequence can be explained in this way .",
    "n - body simulations that can more directly assess the longevity of binaries , without the simplifying assumption that they reside at a fixed radius , would be valuable .    in the context of thick envelopes , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .  4 , the faintest of the he  wd candidates would have cooling ages of 13  gyr .",
    "very old he  wds could have evolved from main - sequence stars with masses of 2 , whose ms lifetimes are 1  gyr @xcite .",
    "such stars have core masses 0.3  as they are leaving the main sequence @xcite . using the present thick - envelope models",
    ", the total inferred ages would be uncomfortably high considering recent age determinations for the cluster : 12  @xmath4  0.8  gyr @xcite and 11.47  @xmath4  0.47  gyr @xcite .",
    "this alone should not rule out thick envelopes , however . given the strong dependence of cooling rates on h envelope mass ,",
    "even slightly lower envelope masses would likely bring the ages into agreement .",
    "moreover , the argument against thick envelopes put forward by @xcite rests in large part on their finding that binaries in the core will either merge or be broken up after  1 gyr .",
    "they also suggest that common - envelope ( ce ) evolution will lead to thin h envelopes .",
    "however , in view of the location of many of the binaries outside the cluster core , and the lack of direct evidence that ce evolution leaves behind thin envelopes , we conclude that thick envelopes are not ruled out .",
    "another possibility is that the he  wds could be a mixture of systems , some with thick and others with thin h envelopes .",
    "if common - envelope evolution does lead to he  wds with thin envelopes @xcite , then all systems for which a 0.8  giant overflows its roche lobe onto a co  wd companion with  1  should have thin envelopes and cool off quickly .",
    "for giants with co  wd companions of larger mass , however , the mass transfer would be stable .",
    "if thick envelopes were the result , then this subset of systems would cool much more slowly .",
    "the brightest systems in ngc  6397 could potentially be explained as such higher - mass binaries .",
    "this hypothesis is appealing in that it could help make sense of two other ways in which the four brightest he  wds seem to set themselves apart from the remaining 20 he  wd candidates .",
    "first , their apparently greater concentration toward the center ( median radial offset of 12  vs.  33  for the fainter 20 ) could be explained as the result of mass segregation .",
    "second , the 1.6-magnitude gap between the four brightest he  wds and the remaining systems could be the result of two very different rates of cooling .",
    "judging from the models shown in fig .  4 , the youngest thick - envelope stars would have ages similar to the oldest thin - envelope stars ( 1  gyr ) .",
    "he  wds formed via stable mass transfer should have relatively long periods following the mass transfer episode : @xmath60 days for @xmath0  he  wds @xcite .",
    "these binaries would be more vulnerable to exchange interactions than post - common - envelope binaries which would have much shorter periods .",
    "nevertheless , at the range of radii where the four bright he  wds lie ( 6 - 24 ) , systems with 2-day periods could survive 0.6 - 10 gyr , while systems with 40-day periods could survive 0.08 - 2 gyr before the he  wd would be exchanged out of the binary ( cf .",
    "we surmise that the few we see concentrated to the cluster center could be the remnant of a larger population of such systems .",
    "finally , we note that the possibility that some he  wds could be torn away from their binary companions via exchange interactions raises the question of where these stars would be at present , and whether a second population of he  wds might be observable in the cluster",
    ". it may be that such stars would acquire high enough recoil velocities during exchange interactions that they would simply be ejected from the cluster .",
    "escape from the cluster would follow , for example , if a 0.2  he  wd in a 10-day binary with a 1  co  wd acquired a velocity comparable to its orbital velocity of 90 km s@xmath17 . if , however , he  wds are retained in the cluster following exchange interactions , their half - mass radius should be larger than that of the cluster as a whole (  140 ) , due to their very low masses .    to estimate how many such isolated he",
    "wds would still lie within the field of view spanned by the present observations , we first note that any thin - envelope he  wds older than 3  gyr would be fainter than the detection limit ( see fig .  4 , right panel ) . scaling from the 24 he  wds with ages of 1  gyr or less",
    ", we estimate that another 50 would have cooling ages in the range @xmath61  gyr . using the radial distribution of 0.25  stars in the fokker - planck models of ngc  6397 developed by @xcite , and assuming",
    "that all 50 of these he  wds have been exchanged out of binaries , we estimate that 8 isolated he  wds would currently lie within a radius of 1.5 .",
    "this is just barely compatible with our finding above that up to 10 he  wds could hide in the broad wings of the co  wd distribution at very faint magnitudes in the cmd .    using the same approach",
    "we can ask how many isolated he  wds would be present in the off - center field studied by @xcite . assuming that he  wds",
    "could be detected with ages up to 10  gyr in that field , we estimate that 7 isolated he  wds would be present in their full acs / wfc field .",
    "taking a look at the cmd for that field ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) , there is no clear sequence of he  wds , but there are nevertheless several stars in the region such stars would occupy .",
    "since it is possible that these stars are unrelated to the cluster , we also inspected their proper - motion - cleaned cmd ( their fig .",
    "5 ) . in this cmd",
    ", only 2 stars are present in the he  wd region .",
    "however , this cmd excludes roughly 40% of the area of the original field ( the area not covered by the 1st - epoch wfpc2 data ) , such that we would predict the presence of 4 isolated he  wds , consistent with what is seen .",
    "we conclude that current observations do not rule out the existence of a second population of very faint , isolated he  wds in ngc  6397 .",
    "we have identified a set of 24 faint blue , -faint stars in the globular cluster ngc  6397 that are good candidates to be white dwarfs with helium cores .",
    "this is the first extended sequence of he  wds found in a globular cluster .",
    "the masses of the he  wd candidates that we infer from comparisons to the colors and magnitudes of theoretical cooling models are in the range @xmath0 .",
    "dynamical masses inferred from the radial distribution are significantly higher , on the order of 1.2 , implying the presence of binary companions .",
    "constraints from the observed colors of the he  wds and their lack of x - ray counterparts suggest that the companions are most likely to be heavy white dwarfs .",
    "the rate of formation of he  wds that can be inferred from their distribution in the color - magnitude diagram is highly dependent on their rate of cooling , which in turn depends on the uncertain thickness of their hydrogen layers .",
    "we compare the observed systems to two set of models , one with thick and the other with thin h envelopes , and infer that @xmath1% of stars currently turning off the main sequence eventually become he  wds .",
    "this can be understood if @xmath1% of main - sequence stars have or obtain co  wd companions by the time they begin evolving up the rgb .",
    "initial binary periods of @xmath62 days are required to produce he  wds with the masses we observe .",
    "we note that this binary fraction is a lower limit to the overall binary fraction in the cluster , as it accounts only for the subset of binaries that yields he  wds with co  wd companions .",
    "the he  wd sequence ends about 1.5 magnitudes above the limiting magnitude of our study .",
    "the interpretation of this termination is different in the context of thick vs.  thin h envelopes . in the case of thick envelopes ,",
    "the faintest observed systems have ages comparable to the age of the cluster . in the case of thin envelopes , the faintest have ages of 1 gyr .",
    "neither the thick nor thin envelopes considered here provide a completely satisfactory explanation for the current observations .",
    "it does seem clear that the brightest four he  wds have thick h envelopes , as thin envelopes would imply very young ages that in turn would require an implausibly high rate of he  wd formation at the present epoch . if the rest have thin envelopes then the termination of the he  wd sequence must be explained .",
    "the suggestion by @xcite that mergers and/or exchanges destroy the binaries after 1 gyr appears viable , and could perhaps be tested by wider - area searches for faint he  wds in off - center fields .",
    "if all he  wds have thick h  envelopes , then the envelope thickness must be somewhat lower than what we have assumed here in order for the oldest observed he  wds to have cooling ages compatible with the age of the cluster .",
    "nearly all of the co  wds brighter than 625  24.5 ( @xmath63k ) have  colors that strongly suggest that they have the broad  absorption lines characteristic of da - type ( hydrogen - atmosphere ) wds .",
    "this suggests that whatever mechanism is operating to produce dbs ( or other non - da type wds ) in the field is ineffective in ngc  6397 .",
    "white dwarf mass is unlikely to be the primary factor determining the relative abundance of da vs.  non - da wds since the masses of co  wds in ngc  6397 are similar to those of co  wds in the field .",
    "the 126 stars in our sample of tentatively classified co  wds represents the largest sample of wds for which atmospheric classifications have been obtained in a single cluster .",
    "while further validation of the method is needed to ensure that it reliably distinguishes da from non - da wds ,  imaging should be a powerful tool to classify white dwarfs in star clusters .",
    "finally , we have compared the observed co  wd sequence to theoretical cooling models to measure a distance to ngc  6397 . with an assumed co  wd mass of 0.53  and reddening of @xmath32 = 0.18 ,",
    "we obtain a distance of 2.34  @xmath4  0.13  kpc .",

    "<S> we present results of a study of the central regions of ngc  6397 using hubble space telescope s advanced camera for surveys ( hst acs ) , focusing on a group of 24 faint blue stars that form a sequence parallel to , but brighter than , the more populated sequence of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( co  wds ) . using f625w , f435w , and f658n filters with the wide field channel ( wfc ) </S>",
    "<S> we show that these stars , 18 of which are newly discovered , have magnitudes and colors consistent with those of helium - core white dwarfs ( he  wds ) with masses @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> their  colors indicate that they have strong absorption lines , which distinguishes them from cataclysmic variables in the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the radial distribution of the he  wds is significantly more concentrated to the cluster center than that of either the co  wds or the turnoff stars and most closely resembles that of the cluster s blue stragglers . </S>",
    "<S> binary companions are required to explain the implied dynamical masses . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the companions can not be main - sequence stars and are most likely heavy co  wds . </S>",
    "<S> the number and photometric masses of the observed he  wds can be understood if @xmath1% of the main - sequence stars within the half - mass radius of the cluster have white dwarf companions with orbital periods in the range @xmath2 days at the time they reach the turnoff . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the co  wd sequence , the he  wd sequence comes to an end at 625  @xmath3 24.5 , well above the magnitude limit of the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the significance of this finding in the context of thick vs.  thin hydrogen envelope models and compare our results to existing theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find strong evidence that the vast majority of the co  wds in ngc  6397 down to  @xmath3 10,000  k are of the da class . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the co  wd sequence together with theoretical cooling models to measure a distance to the cluster of 2.34  @xmath4  0.13  kpc , or @xmath5 . </S>"
