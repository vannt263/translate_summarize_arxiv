    "many recent theoretical and experimental studies have provided a large body of evidence on the essentially constructive role played by fluctuations in a variety of intriguing noise induced phenomena .",
    "some key - examples are : problems of self - organization and dissipative structures , noise induced transitions , noise induced _ phase _ transitions , _ thermal ratchets _ or brownian motors , coupled brownian motors , noise sustained patterns and stochastic resonance @xcite .",
    "this last phenomenon , that is _",
    "stochastic resonance _ ( sr ) , has attracted considerable interest due , among other aspects , to its potential technological applications for optimizing the transmission of information in nonlinear dynamical systems . for a comprehensive recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite , that shows the large number of applications in science and technology , ranging from paleoclimatology , to electronic circuits , lasers , and noise - induced information flow in sensory neurons in living systems , to name a few .",
    "several recent papers have aimed at achieving an enhancement of the output snr by means of the coupling of several sr units @xcite in what conforms an  extended medium \" @xcite .    the relevance of pattern - formation phenomena to several areas of science and technology is a very well established fact . accounts of the state of the art can be found in many reviews and books @xcite , collecting the results obtained over the last couple of decades regarding the description of pattern formation and propagation phenomena in self - organizing systems .",
    "it is a common belief that the nontrivial spatio - temporal behaviour occurring for instance in the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) , reaction - diffusion ( rd ) schemes , and other nonequilibrium systems , originates from the _ non - potential _ ( or _ non - variational _ ) character of the dynamics , meaning that there is no lyapunov functional ( lf ) for the dynamics .",
    "however , graham and co - workers , have shown that a lyapunov - like functional does exist for the cgle @xcite .    in order to fix ideas , we start by discussing the existance of lf in two different dynamical situations . the simplest case , in which a lf exists , corresponds to a _",
    "gradient flow system _ such as @xmath0 the fixed points will correspond to the extrema of the  potential function \" @xmath1 , and the system will evolve towards these minima of @xmath1 following trajectories corresponding to the line of _ steepest descent_. clearly @xmath1 is a lf as it also satisfies @xmath2    now we consider an example corresponding to a non - gradient flow .",
    "we take the following case @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an arbitrary , positive definite matrix .",
    "we can separate it into a symmetric ( @xmath5 ) and an antisymmetric ( @xmath6 ) part @xmath7 the fixed points are given by the extrema of @xmath8 . on the other hand we have that @xmath8 also fulfills @xmath9 as ,",
    "clearly , the first term on the rhs is @xmath10 , while the second one is @xmath11 , hence , @xmath8 is a lf .",
    "the system evolves to the minima following trajectories different from the steepest descent ones , determined by @xmath5 , since the antisymmetric part of @xmath4 induces a flow in the system that keeps the lf constant .",
    "a thorough ( and didactic ) discussion on the lf and different kinds of dynamical flows can be found in @xcite .",
    "the use of the lf concept ( as well as the related one of nonequilibrium potential for stochastic systems ) in relation to far from equilibrium systems is scarce .",
    "however , there are recent papers that have made use of these ideas in relation not only with cgle @xcite , but also for reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "some of these works concerned the derivation of effective equations for the evolution of fronts @xcite ; while others were related to the determination of the global stability of the resulting patterns and the possibility of exchanging the relative stability between attractors @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the concept of nonequilibrium potential ( nep ) .",
    "when the nep can be obtained , such an approach offers an alternative way of confronting a problem that has attracted considerable attention , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "namely , the relative stability of the different attractors , corresponding to spatially extended states , and the possibility of transitions among them due to the effect of fluctuations @xcite . the latter aspect which is of great relevance in the study of sr in spatially extended systems , is the objective of this work .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "as indicated , in the next section we briefly discuss some basic notions about nonequilibrium potentials , and show a few relevant examples for reaction - diffusion systems . in section iii we present the results for the snr in some of the previous examples .",
    "section iv contains a final discussion and some conclusions .",
    "loosely speaking , the notion of non - equilibrium potential ( nep ) corresponds to an extension of the notion of equilibrium thermodynamical potential to non - equilibrium situations . in order to introduce such nep",
    ", we consider a general form of non - linear stochastic equations , admitting the possibility of _ multiplicative noises_. in particular , we consider equations of the form @xmath12 where repeated indices are summed over . equation ( [ eq ] ) is stated in the sense of it .",
    "the @xmath13 are mutually independent sources of gaussian white noise with typical strength @xmath14 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation corresponding to eq.([eq ] ) takes the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability density of observing @xmath17 at time @xmath18 for noise intensity @xmath14 , and @xmath19 is the matrix of transport coefficients of the system , which is symmetric and non - negative . in the long time limit",
    "( @xmath20 ) , the solution of eq.([fp ] ) tends to the stationary distribution @xmath21 . according to @xcite , @xmath22 , the nep associated to eq.([fp ] ) ,",
    "is defined by @xmath23 in other words @xmath24\\,d\\omega_q,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the nep of the system and @xmath25 is defined as the limit @xmath26.\\ ] ] here @xmath27 is the invariant volume element in the @xmath28-space and @xmath29 is the determinant of the contravariant metric tensor ( for the euclidean metric it is @xmath30 ) .",
    "it was shown @xcite that @xmath22 is the solution of a hamilton - jacobi like equation ( hje ) @xmath31 and @xmath25 is the solution of a linear first - order partial differential equation depending on @xmath22 ( not shown here ) .    equation ( [ pot ] ) and the normalizability condition ensure that @xmath32 is bounded from below .",
    "furthermore , from the separation of the streaming velocity of the probability flow in the steady state into conservative and dissipative parts , it follows that @xmath33 i.e.  @xmath32 is a lf for the dynamics of the system when fluctuations are neglected . under the deterministic dynamics : @xmath34 , @xmath32 decreases monotonically and takes a minimum value on attractors . in particular , @xmath32 must be constant on all extended attractors ( such as limit cycles or strange attractors ) @xcite .        as a first example we focus on a one  dimensional , one  component model of an electrothermal instability @xcite , which corresponds to an approximation to the continuous limit of the coupled system studied by lindner _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "for this model , the effect of boundary conditions ( b.c . ) in pattern selection , the _ global stability _ of nonhomogeneous structures , and the critical - like behaviour due to the coalescence of two patterns @xcite , have been studied .",
    "the rd model that we work with describes the time evolution of a field @xmath35 which represents the temperature profile in the so - called `` hot spot model '' in superconducting microbridges ( or ballast resistor ) @xcite .",

    "we restrict our discussion to the parameter range where the ( associated deterministic ) system has two stable attractors ( patterns ) .",
    "the piecewise linear approximation of the reaction term , mimicking a cubic polynomial , was chosen in order to find analytical expressions for the spatially symmetric solutions of eq.([ballast ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the trivial solution @xmath42 , which is linearly stable , exists for the whole range of parameters . besides this solution we find only one stable nonhomogeneous structure , @xmath43 , which presents an excited ( @xmath44 ) central zone , and another similar unstable structure , @xmath45 , with a smaller excited central zone .",
    "the latter pattern corresponds to the saddle separating both attractors @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the indicated patterns are minima of the nep of our system . for the present case ,",
    "such a nep reads @xcite @xmath48=\\int_{-l}^{+l}\\left\\ { -\\int_0^\\phi \\left ( -\\phi + \\theta [ \\phi -\\phi _ c]\\right ) \\,d\\phi .+\\frac d2\\left ( \\frac{\\partial \\phi } { \\partial x}\\right ) ^2\\,\\right\\ } dx.\\ ] ] it can be shown that @xmath49 and also @xmath50 this functional offers us the possibility to study both the local and global stability of the patterns as well as the changes associated to variations of model parameters .",

    "we limited the analysis to the parameter region where eq.([gamma ] ) is valid , the matrix @xmath87 is positive definite , and hence the nonequilibrium potential is given by eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .",
    "although these conditions impose restrictions on the range of application of our treatment , it is worth noting that , after choosing the values of the @xmath89 s satisfying the condition of positive definiteness , there is still a wide spectrum of interesting situations to analyze @xcite .",
    "furthermore the nonlinear function @xmath90 is still arbitrary , opening a wealth of possibilities . when plotting @xmath32vs.@xmath63 , with @xmath32 evaluated on the stationary patterns , we see a result similar to the one shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the calculation of the snr proceeds , for the spatially extended problem , through the evaluation of the space - time correlation function @xmath91 . to do that we have used a simplified point of view , based on the two - state approach @xcite , which allows us to apply some known results almost directly .",

    "the signal is introduced as a ( slow ) modulation in a parameter @xmath87 by setting @xmath152 added to the autocatalytic function @xmath90 .",
    "we now analyze the sr phenomenon in our spatially extended system using the theory discussed before .",
    "to proceed with such an analysis we identify the two stable patterns ( @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) with the states of the two - state - theory .",
    "hence , the discrete variable @xmath68 will adopt values @xmath92 and @xmath93 according to whether the system is in the states @xmath149 or @xmath150 , yielding the result for the snr in eq .",
    "( [ rtilde ] ) .",
    "the changes induced in the patterns and their stability by the variation of some model parameter will be reflected in changes in the values of @xmath153 and @xmath154 and , accordingly , will affect the results for the snr .",
    "we fix @xmath155 and @xmath156 , and leave @xmath58 , @xmath157 and @xmath14 ( the noise intensity ) as free parameters .",
    "note that with the chosen values for the @xmath151 s , the only relevant noise term in the system ( eq .",
    "( [ utfu ] ) ) is @xmath158 in the equation for @xmath148 that appears added to the signal ( hence it can be considered as coming together with the signal ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath159 and @xmath160 are set different from zero to keep the system inside the parameter region where @xmath161 $ ] as defined in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) is valid as a nonequilibrium potential @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the results for the snr @xmath162 as a function of the noise intensity for different values of @xmath58 and @xmath157 . we see that while keeping @xmath157 constant ( @xmath163 ) ( fig .",
    "2 a ) , the largest values of @xmath164 are those for @xmath165 , which is the symmetric situation . also , if we fix @xmath165 ( fig . 2",
    "b ) , any departure of @xmath157 from the value @xmath166 ( that is any departure from the symmetric situation ) lowers the values of @xmath164 .",
    "hence , the symmetric situation is found to be the most favorable one concerning the improvement of snr .",
    "note that the maximum of the @xmath164 vs. @xmath14 curve ( for fixed values of @xmath157 and @xmath58 ) , that we will call @xmath167 , increases with symmetry and reaches its largest value for the symmetric situation . in fig .",
    "3 we show @xmath167 plotted as a function of @xmath58 for @xmath163 , where it is apparent that the optimum value of diffusion is @xmath165 corresponding , as indicated , to the symmetric case .",
    "a fact that arises from these results is that , while keeping all the other parameters of the system fixed , there exists an optimal value of diffusion ( coupling of the distributed system ) that maximizes snr .",
    "the interesting aspect is that this optimal value is the one that makes the potential symmetric .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these results do not contradict but complete those in @xcite where enhancement due to coupling was found , since in that work only symmetric situations were analyzed . roughly speaking",
    ", the main result in @xcite can be summarized saying that , given two different symmetric situations ( each one necessarily having different values of @xmath58 and @xmath157 ) , the one with the higher value of @xmath58 produces higher values of snr .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that for a too large value of @xmath58 , some of the approximations involved in the calculations may break down @xcite .",
    "also , it is worth here pointing out that the same thing may happen for too large asymmetries . for example , consider an extremely asymmetric situation where the barrier for , say the transition from state @xmath149 to @xmath150 , is much larger than the barrier for the opposite transition .",
    "in such a case , the values of the noise intensity leading to reasonable jumping rates from @xmath149 to @xmath150 will be far beyond the validity of the kramers - like approximation for the inverse transition .",
    "the model we discuss next is an extension of the one - component rd model discussed in section 2 , but now the diffusive parameter depends on the field @xmath168 . as a matter of fact , since in the ballast resistor the thermal conductivity is a function of the energy density , the resulting equation for the temperature field includes a temperature - dependent diffusion coefficient in a natural way .    by adequate rescaling of the field",
    ", space - time variables and parameters , we get a dimensionless time - evolution equation for the field @xmath35 @xmath169 where @xmath38 is a white noise in space and time , and @xmath170 , @xmath171 is the step function .",
    "all the effects of the parameters that keep the system away of equilibrium ( such as the electric current in the electrothermal devices or some external reactant concentration in chemical models ) are included in @xmath63 .    as was done for the reaction term @xcite ,",
    "a simple choice that retains however the qualitative features of the system is to consider the following dependence of the diffusion term on the field variable @xmath172,\\ ] ] for simplicity , here we choose the same threshold @xmath57 for the reaction term and the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we assume the system to be limited to a bounded domain @xmath173 $ ] with dirichlet boundary conditions at both ends , i.e.@xmath174 .",
    "as before , the piecewise - linear approximation of the reaction term in eq.([ballast2 ] ) was chosen in order to find analytical expressions for its stationary spatially - symmetric solutions .",
    "in addition to the trivial solution @xmath175 ( which is linearly stable and exists for the whole range of parameters ) we find another linearly stable nonhomogeneous structure @xmath43presenting an excited central zone ( where @xmath176 ) for @xmath177and a similar unstable structure @xmath60 , which exhibits a smaller excited central zone .",
    "the form of these patterns is analogous to what has been obtained in previous related works @xcite .",
    "the difference is that in the present case @xmath178 is discontinuous and the area of the  activated \" central zone depends on @xmath179 .",
    "the indicated patterns are extrema of the nep .",
    "in fact , the unstable pattern @xmath60 is a _ saddle - point _ of this functional , separating the _ attractors _ @xmath180 and @xmath43 . for the case of a field - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath181 as described by eq .",
    "( [ ballast2 ] ) , the nep reads @xcite @xmath182=\\int_{-l}^{+l}\\left\\{-\\int_0^\\phi d(\\phi')f(\\phi')\\,d\\phi'+ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(d(\\phi)\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)^2\\,\\right\\}dx.\\ ] ] given that @xmath183 one finds @xmath184 , thus warranting the lf property .    for a given threshold value @xmath185 ,",
    "both wells corresponding in a representation of the nep to the linearly stable states have the same depth ( i.e.  both states are equally stable ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the dependence of @xmath186 $ ] on the parameter @xmath187 . as in previous cases , we analyze only the neighborhood of @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "here we also consider the neighborhood of @xmath189 , where the main trends of the effect can be captured .    in fig.5",
    "we depict the dependence of @xmath164 on the noise intensity @xmath190 , for several ( positive ) values of @xmath179 .",
    "these curves show the typical maximum that has become the fingerprint of the stochastic resonance phenomenon .",
    "figure 6 is a plot of the value @xmath167 of these maxima as a function of @xmath179 .",
    "the dramatic increase of @xmath167 ( several @xmath191 for a _ small _ positive variation of @xmath179 ) , is apparent and shows the strong effect that the selective coupling ( or field - dependent diffusivity ) has on the response of the system .",
    "it must be noted that the only two approximations made in order to derive eq.([rtilde])namely the kramers - like expression in eq.([w = pref*exp ] ) and the two - level approximation used for the evaluation of the correlation function @xcitebreak down for large positive values of @xmath179 because for increasing selectivity the curves of @xmath186 $ ] vs.  @xmath63 in fig .  4 shift towards the left , which in turn means that the barrier separating the attractors at @xmath192 tends to zero .",
    "this effect is basically the same as the one discussed in ref.@xcite in connection with global diffusivity @xmath193 .",
    "it is also worth noting that except for the two aforementioned approximations , all the previous results ( e.g.the profiles of the stationary patterns and the corresponding values of the non - equilibrium potential ) are analytically exact .",
    "in this work we have presented the basic ingredients for studying sr in coupled or extended media ( _ stochastic resonant medium _",
    "@xcite ) by means of nonequilibrium potential techniques .",
    "we have shown some examples of nep for rd systems and the way we can exploit them to get information about the system s response ( the snr ) to weak potential modulations .    in previous works",
    "we have shown , in agreement with numerical simulations @xcite how the coupling enhances the system s response .",
    "here we have shown two other aspects : ( a ) the role played by the symmetry of the nep on such enhancement and ; ( b ) the effect of selective coupling .    in the first case the results we have obtained clearly indicate the central role played by symmetry in improving the snr .",
    "we studied the behavior of @xmath167 , that is the maximum of the snr vs. @xmath194 curve , as the different model parameters are ( not simultaneously ) varied , finding that @xmath167 always increases with the symmetry of the potential .",
    "this fact led us to our main result : the optimal values of the different model parameters ( for instance diffusivity or threshold ) , as regards the maximization of @xmath167 , correspond to those making the potential more symmetric in each situation .",
    "besides the analysis of the influence of symmetry on stochastic resonance , it is important to remark that the mere consideration of asymmetric situations has its own relevance .",
    "this is because such bistable asymmetric models provide , for example , the appropriate framework for describing sr in voltage ",
    "dependent ion channels , as proposed in some biological experiments . in those systems , the conducting state is associated a higher - energy well than the non  conducting one @xcite .    in the second case , the results of our analysis of a scalar rd system ( a generalization of the continuous limit of the model analyzed in @xcite ) indicate that a  selective \" coupling ( that is a field diffusion dependent constant ) could offer a new enhancing mechanism in coupling systems .",
    "this prediction prompts to devise experiments ( for instance , through electronic setups ) as well as numerical simulations taking into account the indicated selective coupling .",
    "one direction in which the present studies can be extended corresponds to the analysis of the competition between local and nonlocal couplings .",
    "consider the same nep described by eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , but with only one inhibitor , the temporally slaved @xmath75 . for this system",
    "the nep @xmath32 has the form @xmath195=\\int dx \\left[\\frac{d}{2 } ( \\nabla u(x , t))^2 + c \\int dx'g(x , x ' ) u(x , t ) u(x',t ) \\right],\\ ] ] where the coupling constant @xmath196 , that in one of the systems studied in @xcite was positive ( that is due to an inhibition interaction ) , is now assumed negative ( that is an _ excitatory interaction _ ) .",
    "the results of preliminary studies for the case of excitatory coupling , where we used the same kind of approach indicated above , are shown in fig .",
    "we have compared the results for the snr vs. noise intensity for the fitzhugh - naguno model @xcite with inhibitory interaction , with those obtained in the above indicated case .",
    "it is apparent , on one hand , the snr enhancement due to the excitatory interaction , while on the other , that small changes in the diffusion constant of the activator (  local coupling \" constant ) strongly affect the snr .",
    "the analysis of the different aspects of this problem will be the subject of a forthcoming paper @xcite .",

    "<S> previous works have shown numerically that the response of a `` stochastic resonator '' is enhanced as a consequence of spatial coupling . also , similar results have been obtained in a reaction - diffusion model by studying the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) in spatially extended systems using _ nonequilibrium potential _ ( nep ) techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of the nep for such systems allows us to determine the probability for the decay of the metastable extended states , and approximate expressions for the correlation function and the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , exploiting known forms of the nep , we have investigated the role of nep s symmetry on sr , the enhancement of the snr due to a _ selectivity _ of the coupling or diffusion parameter , and discussed competition between local and nonlocal ( excitatory ) coupling . </S>"
