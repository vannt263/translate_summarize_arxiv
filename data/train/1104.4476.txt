    "the study of non - equilibrium magnetotransport in high mobility two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) has acquired great experimental and theoretical interest . strong magnetoresistance oscillations ( miro ) and zero resistance states ( zrs )",
    "have been observed in high mobility + @xmath1 heterostructures subject to a magnetic field and to microwave radiation @xcite .",
    "our current understanding of this phenomenon rests upon models that predict the existence of negative - resistance states ( nrs ) yielding an instability that rapidly drives the system into a zrs @xcite .",
    "two distinct mechanisms for the generation of nrs are known , one is based in the microwave - induced impurity scattering @xcite , while the second is linked to inelastic processes leading to a non - trivial electron distribution function @xcite .",
    "more recently , hall field - induced resistance oscillations ( hiro ) and zero differential resistance states ( zdrs ) have been observed in response to strong dc electric current excitations @xcite .",
    "the effect of a direct dc current on electron transport can be quite dramatic leading to zero differential resistance states ( zdrs)@xcite . at low temperature and above a threshold bias current the differential resistance vanishes and the longitudinal dc voltage becomes constant .",
    "bykov et al.@xcite discussed their experimental results following an approach similar to that of andreev et al .",
    "@xcite . in terms of the differential longitudinal resistivity @xmath2",
    "the stability condition reads @xmath3 hence , according to the condition in eq .",
    "( [ stabcond ] ) the 2des is unstable at negative differential resistance .",
    "the presence of the zdrs can be attributed to the formation of negative differential resistance states ( ndrs ) that yields an instability that drives the system into a zdrs .",
    "in a recent work we presented a model @xcite to describe the nonlinear response to a direct dc current applied to a 2deg in a strong magnetic field . the model incorporates the exact dynamics of two - dimensional damped electrons in the presence of arbitrarily strong magnetic and dc electric fields , while the effects of randomly distributed impurities are perturbatively added . from the analysis of the differential resistivity and the longitudinal voltage we observe the formation of negative differential resistivity states .",
    "both the effects of elastic impurity scattering as well as those related to inelastic processes play an important role .",
    "the theoretical predictions correctly reproduce the main experimental features provided that the inelastic scattering rate obeys a @xmath4 temperature dependence , consistent with electron - electron interaction effects .",
    "the more relevant results are presented here .",
    "after the current density is worked out , it splits into a drude and an impurity induced contribution : @xmath5 .",
    "the drude contribution is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electron density and the drift velocity is given as    @xmath8    here , @xmath9 is the unit vector normal to the plane of the system , @xmath10 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath11 is the effective mass of the charge carrier , and @xmath12 is the transport scattering time .",
    "it is important to point out that the drude term is not added by hand ; instead it explicitly appears in our formalism because the exact solution of the schrdinger equation in the presence of magnetic an electric fields is obtained from a unitary transformation @xcite that incorporates the solution of the classical equation of motion .    in the presence of elastic scattering",
    "an electron exchanges a momentum @xmath13 with the impurity scatterers .",
    "hence , the components of the impurity induced density current can be expressed as @xmath14 g^i_{\\mu\\mu^{\\prime } } \\left(q\\right ) \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the impurity density , and @xmath17 is the fermi distribution function evaluated at the energies @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the landau levels are tilted by the electric field according to @xmath20 ; with @xmath21 .",
    "notice that the @xmath22 component of the exchanged momentum @xmath23 is equivalent to a hopping ( shifting of the guiding center ) in the @xmath24 direction @xmath25 ; with @xmath26 the magnetic length .",
    "the function @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ dencu2 ] ) is given by @xmath28 in the previous equation @xmath29 is the 2d antisymmetric tensor , @xmath30 ^ 2 -\\omega_c^2+\\gamma^2 $ ] , @xmath31 is the fourier component of the scattering potential , and @xmath32 is the landau level broadening factor . in order to take into account the known fact that the width of lls depends on the magnetic field @xcite , we consider @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a phenomenological parameter that takes into account the difference between the transport scattering time @xmath12 and the quantum scattering time @xmath35 . in the case of short range",
    "neutral impurities @xmath36 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath37 are given in terms of the associated laguerre polynomial , see @xcite .    in recent work",
    "is has been reported that the temperature dependence of nonlinear oscillatory magnetoresistance in 2deg subject to a strong dc electric field can be explained if the quantum scattering time @xmath35 incorporates a temperature dependence that is attributed to electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "the quantum scattering rate is written as    @xmath38    the parameter @xmath39 has to be experimentally determined , but it is a constant of the order of the unity . for short range neutral scatterers the impurity rate can be estimated as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is related to the scattering length @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the nonlinear transport regime . in a current controlled scheme",
    ": the longitudinal density current is fixed to a constant value @xmath42 and there is no transverse current , @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to a set of two implicit equations for the density current @xmath44 they represent two implicit equation for the unknown @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; the equations can be solved following a self - consistent iteration @xcite .",
    "however , it is verified that for the conditions that apply in experiments and in the separated ll regions ( @xmath47 ) , the solution of the previous equations simplify because the following conditions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "hence , from the first equation in ( [ curr2 ] ) it follows that the leading contribution to the hall electric field is given by the classical result @xmath50 . whereas the second equation in ( [ curr2 ] ) yields a nonlinear @xmath51 relation    @xmath52    the expression for the impurity induced currents @xmath53",
    "is given in eq .",
    "( [ dencu2 ] ) . in what follows we set @xmath54 .",
    "we had previously presented numerical results in very good agreement with the experimental ones , based in eq .",
    "( [ relej ] ) @xcite , and in the self consistent solution of equations in ( [ curr2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "however in this work we point out that an approximated analytical @xmath55 relation can be obtained .",
    "as we are interested in the separated ll region the dominant effect is provided by the intra - landau transitions .",
    "we include the following assumptions : ( 1 ) only the ll nearest to the fermi level contribute .",
    "( 2 ) the potential is taken as a constant @xmath56 , corresponding to a short - range impurity scattering , and ( 3 ) the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ dencu2 ] ) has a dominant peak at the value @xmath57 , this allow us to carry out explicitly the integral over the laguerre polynomials .",
    "after the angular integral are evaluated , a simply @xmath58 relation is obtained    @xmath59    \\ , , \\ ] ]    the parameters in this equation are given as @xmath60    eq . ( [ relej1 ] ) depends on the a temperature through the @xmath61-dependence of @xmath12 . in the simplest approximation , short range impurity scatterers",
    ", we can consider that @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath35 , consequently the @xmath61 dependence is dictated by eq .",
    "( [ trelaj ] ) . utilizing this assumption and the simple equation in ( [ trelaj ] ) we carried out the comparison with the experimental results , observing a very good agreement .",
    "in particular the transition from positive to zero differential resistance states shows the correct dependence on the temperature @xcite .    in this work we shall concentrate in a simple but interesting limit , we take @xmath62 and consider the analysis of the stability of the ndrs",
    ". therefore the transport scattering rate coincides with the impurity scattering rate : @xmath63 . in the region of positive differential resistivity @xmath64 ,",
    "the relation between between @xmath45 and @xmath65 is single - valued and an homogeneous uniform electron density throughout the system is stable . on the other hand , in the region in which @xmath66 is negative corresponding to a ndrs , the system becomes unstable . an approximated scheme ( maxwell construction )",
    "replaces the negative slope by a horizontal line , @xmath67 a zdrs .",
    "the real reason for the appearance of a negative slope in the @xmath68 plot is the implicit restraint of uniform electron density throughout the system .",
    "however in these regions configurations with a non uniform current distribution turn out to be the equilibrium configuration of the system .",
    "the simplest possible pattern is a domain wall : two parts of the sample carry stable density currents @xmath69 and @xmath70 with the same value of @xmath45 .",
    "hence we expect a phase transition defined by a critical iso-@xmath71 line , that passes through a critical point that is a point of inflection of this iso-@xmath71 line ; so both @xmath72 and @xmath73 vanish at this point .",
    "the critical values : @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ; at which these conditions are satisfied are readily determined as    @xmath77    with the values of the constants @xmath78 given by : @xmath79 notice that the method follows similar steps those used in the analysis of the critical point of the van der waals equation @xcite .    using eqs .",
    "( [ param1 ] ) , and ( [ param2 ] ) we can express @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 is terms of the parameters of the system . in order to get an estimation we consider : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "so we obtain :    @xmath87    these values correspond to zero temperature , so are not directly comparable with the experimental ones , however the order of magnitude show a reasonable agreement @xcite .",
    "we now define reduced variables    @xmath88    hence the critical point is localized at @xmath89 . using ( [ relej1 ] ) and ( [ paramred ] )",
