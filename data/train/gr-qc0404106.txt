    "the simplest and most interesting generalization of the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology is the bianchi ix model , whose geometry has the homogeneity constraint but the dynamics makes allowance of anisotropic evolution of different ( linearly independent ) spatial directions .",
    "belinski , kalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) at the end of sixties @xcite derived the oscillatory regime characterizing the asymptotic evolution near the cosmological singularity , describing via a discrete map the resulting chaos . + this mixmaster @xcite dynamics , whose geometry is invariant under the @xmath6 group , allows the line element to be decomposed as a flrw model plus a gravitational waves packet ( @xcite , @xcite ) sufficiently far from the singularity .",
    "+ the various approaches in terms of continuous variables ( i.e. construction of an invariant measure for the system @xcite and study of the system covariance @xcite-@xcite ) have shown how this chaotic feature is invariant with respect to any choice of the temporal gauge and how in this sense it is intrinsic .",
    "+ such deep nature of the mixmaster deterministic chaos and its very early appearance in the universe evolution lead to believe in the existence of a relation with the quantum behavior the system performs during the planckian era .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to give a precise meaning to this relation by constructing the semiclassical limit of a schedinger approach to the canonical quantization of the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) dynamics whose corresponding probability distribution coincides with the ( deterministic ) microcanonical one .",
    "+ in section [ billiard ] are outlined the stochastic properties of the mixmaster dynamics , being isomorphic to a billiard on a lobachevsky plane and is given a stationary statistical distribution within the framework of the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "+ in section [ limit ] we show the existence of a direct correspondence between the classical and quantum dynamics outlined by the common form of the continuity equation for the statistical distribution and the one for the first order approximation in the semiclassical expansion . + as a remarkable feature , both formalisms ( the classical and the quantum one ) are constructed in a generic temporal gauge .",
    "as well known ( see @xcite ) , the dynamics of the bianchi type ix model , in terms of generic misner - chitr  like ( mcl ) variables @xmath7 and corresponding coniugate momenta , is summarized by the variational principle @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes a potential term which , asymptotically to the singularity , is modeled by the potential wall @xmath11 being @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) the anisotropy parameters @xcite , such that the motion of the point universe is restricted in the domain @xmath14 ( see figure [ fig : domain ] ) .",
    "such a dynamical scheme has the relevant feature to let free the choice of the lapse function unless explicitly chosen the form of the function @xmath15 .",
    "the bounces against the potential walls and the instability of the geodesic flow on the lobachevsky plane let the dynamics acquire a stochastic feature .",
    "moreover in @xmath14 the adm hamiltonian    , where the anisotropy parameters @xmath12 are simultaneously greater than 0 .",
    "[ fig : domain],width=302 ]    becomes ( asymptotically ) an `` energy - like '' integral of motion @xmath16 , say @xmath17 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the jacobi metric associated with the principle ( [ qnew ] ) describes a point ",
    "universe moving over a lobachevsky plane reduced by the potential walls ( [ aa ] ) to a billiard .",
    "the statistics of the mixmaster stochasticity is reformulated following the lines presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to derive the invariant measure .",
    "+ this system is well - described by a _ microcanonical ensemble _ , whose liouville invariant measure @xmath18 can be obtained as a solution of the continuity equation @xmath19 over the reduced phase space denotes the @xmath20-circle of the momentum space variable . ]",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath18 explicitly reads @xmath22 using generic mcl variables , the above invariant measure is independent of the choice of the temporal gauge , i.e. of the lapse function .    in order to restrict the invariant measure to the two - dimensional space @xmath23",
    ", we stress how the original hamiltonian equations in the asymptotic limit for which @xmath24 get in @xmath14 the free geodesic motion @xcite @xmath25 by this system , we easily rewrite the stationary continuity equation in the form @xmath26 when assuming the independence of the distribution function @xmath27 from @xmath20 , then the normalization condition leads to the restricted function    @xmath28    thus , we get the following continuity equation for @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath20 plays the role of a parameter and the corresponding _ microcanonical _ solution on the whole configuration space @xmath31 reads @xmath32    we conclude observing how the hamilton equations retain the same form even when the potential walls have a finite ( non - zero ) value .",
    "what above outlined is a mixmaster intrinsic feature and not an effect induced by a particular class of references : the whole mcl formalism and its consequences has been developed in a framework free from the choice of a specific time gauge .",
    "+ since chaos appears close enough to the big bang , we infer that it has some relations with the indeterministic quantum dynamics the model performs in the _ planckian era_. this relation between quantum and deterministic chaos is searched in the sense of a semiclassical limit for a canonical quantization of the model .",
    "the asymptotical principle ( [ qnew ] ) describes a two dimensional hamiltonian system , which can be quantized by a natural schredinger approach @xmath33 being @xmath34 the wave function for the point - universe and , implementing @xmath35 ( see ( [ n2 ] ) ) to an operator = i\\hbar \\ , , \\qquad \\left [ \\hat{\\theta},\\hat{p_{\\theta}}\\right ] = i\\hbar \\ , .\\ ] ] ] , i.e. @xmath36 the equation ( [ sch ] ) rewrites explicitly , in the asymptotic limit @xmath37 , @xmath38^{1/2 } \\psi \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we took an appropriate symmetric normal ordering prescription and we left @xmath39 to stress that the potential can not be neglected on the entire configuration space @xmath31 .",
    "being @xmath39 equal to infinity out of @xmath14 , @xmath40 requires as boundary condition to vanish outside the potential walls , say @xmath41 the _ quantum _ equation ( [ sch1 ] ) is equivalent to the wheeler - dewitt one for the same bianchi model , once separated the positive and negative frequencies solutions @xcite , with the advantage that now @xmath42 is a real time variable .",
    "since the potential walls @xmath39 are time independent , a solution of this equation has the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 are constant coefficients and we assumed a discrete `` energy '' spectrum because the quantum point - universe is restricted in the finite region @xmath14 ; the position ( [ sol ] ) in ( [ sch1 ] ) leads to the eigenvalue problem @xmath45 \\varphi_n = \\nonumber \\\\ = { \\left(\\frac{{e_n}^2-u_{\\infty}}{\\hbar^2}\\right ) } \\varphi_n   \\equiv \\frac{{e_{\\infty}}^2_n}{\\hbar^2 } \\varphi_n      \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in what follows we search the semiclassical solution of this equation regarding the eigenvalue @xmath46 as a finite constant ( i.e. we consider the potential walls as finite ) and only at the end of the procedure we will take the limit for @xmath39 .",
    "we infer that , in the semiclassical limit when @xmath47 and the `` occupation number '' @xmath48 tends to infinity ( but @xmath49 approaches a finite value ) , the wave function @xmath50 approaches a function @xmath51 as @xmath52 the expression for @xmath51 is taken as a semiclassical expansion up to the first order , i.e. @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are functions to be determined . + substituting ( [ expa ] ) in ( [ eig ] ) and separating the real from the complex part , we get two independent equations , i.e. @xmath56\\sqrt{r } \\ , ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we multiplied both sides by @xmath57 and , respectively , @xmath58 in the limit @xmath47 the second term of ( [ 1eq ] ) is negligible meanwhile the first one reduces to the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath59 the solution of ( [ hamb ] ) can be easily checked to be is due to the model adopted and does not affect the probability distribution . ]",
    "@xmath60 we observe that ( [ hamb ] ) , through the identifications @xmath61 is reduced to the algebraic relation @xmath62 the constraint ( [ hamr ] ) is nothing more than the asymptotic one @xmath63 and can be solved by setting @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a momentum - function related to @xmath66 and @xmath67 by the dynamics . on the other hand , by ( [ esse ] )",
    "we get @xmath68 to verify the compatibility of these expressions with ( [ sethm ] ) we use the equations of motion ( [ ham ] )     @xmath69 the required compatibility comes from the identification @xmath70 . since @xmath71 we see by ( [ esse ] ) that the solution @xmath72 vanishes , as due in presence of infinite potential walls , outside @xmath14 .",
    "+ the substitution in ( [ 2eq ] ) of the positions ( [ sethm ] ) ( when the potential walls become infinite , because of chaotic dynamics , @xmath20 behaves like an independent variable and plays here the role of a free parameter ) leads to the new equation @xmath73 we emphasize how this equation coincides with ( [ cont2 ] ) , provided the identification @xmath74 ; it is just this correspondence between the statistical and the semiclassical quantum analysis to ensure that the indeterminism of the quantum dynamics for the bianchi ix model approaches the deterministic chaos in the considered limit . + any constant function is a solution of ( [ cont3 ] ) , but the normalization condition requires @xmath75 and therefore we finally get @xmath76 say the limit for the quantum probability distribution as @xmath77 and @xmath47 associated to the wave function @xmath78 coincides with the classical statistical distribution on the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "+ though this formalism of correspondence remains valid for all bianchi models , only the types viii and ix admit a normalizable wave function @xmath79 , being confined in @xmath14 , and a continuity equation ( [ cont2 ] ) which has a real statistical meaning .",
    "+ since referred to stationary states @xmath80 , the considered semiclassical limit has to be intended in view of a `` macroscopic '' one and is not related to the temporal evolution of the model @xcite ."
