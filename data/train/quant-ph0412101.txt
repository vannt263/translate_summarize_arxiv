    "in the quantum world there are many phenomena whose explanation is beyond the intuitions suggested by the classical world .",
    "for example impossibility of _ cloning _ @xcite or",
    "_ deleting _ @xcite an arbitrary quantum state , existence of _ non - orthogonal _ quantum states @xcite , impossibility of _ spin - flipping _",
    "@xcite , _ etc .",
    "_ let us focus on this last concept .",
    "the spin degree of freedom of a spin @xmath3 system is described by a vector ( or a mixture of projections on vectors ) of a @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space @xmath5 . the quantum mechanical operation which , when applied to a qubit @xmath6 , produces the qubit @xmath7 , orthogonal to @xmath8 , is called _ spin - flipping_. this operation exists if and only if the bloch vector of @xmath8 lies on _ a given _ great circle @xcite .",
    "the classical analogue of spin - flipping is the operation which , when applied to a vector ( for example , in eucledian space ) , produces its negative .",
    "this operation always exists .",
    "it is provable that we can extract more information about the direction of the bloch vector of @xmath8 ( for short , the _ direction _ of @xmath8 ) if , instead of just @xmath8 , we are supplied with @xmath9 or @xmath10 , in words , a pair of _ parallel _ or _ anti - parallel _ qubits . in a classical scenario ,",
    "there is no difference between the parallel and the anti - parallel case , since the classical analogue of spin - flipping always exists .",
    "gisin and popescu @xcite have shown that , when concerning the direction of @xmath8 , anti - parallel qubits provide more information than parallel qubits .",
    "notice that if spin - flipping were possible for each vector of @xmath5 , there would be no difference between these two cases .",
    "gisin and popescu pointed out that parallel qubits span a @xmath11-dimensional subspace of @xmath12 , while anti - parallel qubits span @xmath12 entirely .",
    "intuitively , vectors in an enlarged space are better distinguished than in the original space ; the better we can distinguish the parallel ( or the anti - parallel ) qubits , the more information we can extract about the direction of @xmath8 .",
    "so , according to gisin and popescu , anti - parallel qubits contain more information about the direction of @xmath8 compared to parallel qubits , since the former span a space of higher dimension .",
    "the following question arises naturally : does this difference in extracting information about the direction of a qubit occur only for parallel and anti - parallel qubits ? can this be generalized to other cases ? let us illustrate the situation for general operations rather than just spin - flipping .",
    "consider an operation ( not necessarily quantum mechanical ) @xmath13 on the pure state @xmath8 of a spin @xmath3 system , such that @xmath14 is independent of @xmath8 .",
    "it can be shown that no non - trivial quantum mechanical operation satisfies this last requirement .",
    "in particular , spin - flipping @xmath13 should be of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "one can raise now another question : which of the following two sets @xmath17 is any normalized qubit@xmath18 and @xmath19 is any normalized qubit@xmath18 , where @xmath13 and @xmath20 are two operations such that both latexmath:[$|\\langle\\psi|\\mathcal{a}%    are independent of @xmath8 , contains more information about the direction of the qubit ?",
    "the problem can be posed in the following more general form .",
    "let @xmath22 , for @xmath23 , be one - to - one maps which take @xmath8 into some state of @xmath24 .",
    "which @xmath25 gives the largest amount of information about the direction of @xmath8 , when @xmath8 is sampled according to some _ a priori _ probability distribution on @xmath5 ?",
    "the maps @xmath25 s are said to provide an _ encoding _ of vectors in @xmath5 .",
    "note that spin - flipping provides an encoding .",
    "bagan _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have discussed this problem considering only those maps for which @xmath26 is an eigenstate of a total spin observable along some direction ( specified by the direction of @xmath8 ) , when @xmath8 is sampled from the uniform distribution on @xmath5 . according to their analysis",
    ", spin - flipping does not play any special role ; all that matters ( in order to extract information ) is the dimension of the subspace spanned by the states @xmath26 .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider this _ dimensional argument _ in the context of estimating the direction of a pure qubit when the state @xmath26 is of the form latexmath:[$|\\psi\\rangle^{\\otimes n}\\otimes    @xmath8 and @xmath28 are in one - to - one correspondence .",
    "moreover we assume that the bloch vectors of @xmath8 and @xmath28 lie on two fixed different circles ( possibly small ) . what is the motivation behind the choice of this encoding ?",
    "first of all , small circles are a plausible first step generalization of great circles even though spin - flipping does not exist for states from small circles . however , @xmath9 and @xmath29 , where the bloch vector of @xmath8 lies on a given small circle , span @xmath11-dimensional subspaces .",
    "thus , in our framework , the dimensional arguments of gisin - popescu and bagan _ et al . _ do not give any clue regarding best extraction directional information of the qubit .",
    "we find that , even in this case , anti - parallel qubits contain more information compared to parallel ones .",
    "more generally we see that the information contained in @xmath0 qubits about the direction of @xmath8 , when @xmath8 is encoded in the state @xmath30 and taken with equal probability from a given small circle , decreases with the increment of the difference @xmath31 .",
    "we next consider the problem of estimating the direction of @xmath8 with an encoding of the form @xmath32 , where the bloch vectors of @xmath8 and @xmath28 lie respectively on two parallel circles @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath8 .",
    "note that encoding parallel and anti - parallel qubits are special cases of the this type of encoding .",
    "given two circles @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we have an expression for @xmath36 , the maximum amount of information about the direction of @xmath8 . given a circle @xmath33",
    ", one can calculate the maximum and minimum value of @xmath36 over all possible choices of @xmath34 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath37 and @xmath38 the maximum and the minimum value of @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we show that @xmath39 for all @xmath33 , where @xmath40 is the circle diametrically opposite to @xmath33 .",
    "also in this case the dimensional argument does not work .",
    "another scenario in which the dimensional argument fails is the case of estimating the direction of a qubit sampled from a uniform distribution on set of two diametrically opposite circles . here parallel and anti - parallel qubits",
    "provide same information about the direction of the qubit , even though they span spaces of different dimension .    estimating a qubit from a circle is essentially estimating the phase of the qubit ( see section 4 below and , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "bearing this in mind , one can argue that the measurement basis used in the optimal estimation strategy should be the fourier basis .",
    "this is also reflected by our results .",
    "in fact , we find that the measurement basis for the optimal strategy in the case of a qubit @xmath8 uniformly distributed on a small circle , supplied the state @xmath41 ( where @xmath0 is fixed ) , is the @xmath42-dimensional fourier basis for every @xmath43 .",
    "this is also true if the supplied state is @xmath44 , where @xmath8 and @xmath28 are respectively from two different parallel circles and in one - to - one correspondence .",
    "this is expected as in the case of phase estimation .",
    "moreover , we see that the measurement basis for the optimal strategy in the case of a qubit @xmath8 , uniformly distributed on a set of two diametrically opposite circles , supplied the state @xmath9 , is again the fourier basis ( in three dimensions ) .",
    "it is remarkable that this scenario does not correspond to phase estimation . finally , we observe that , if the supplied state is @xmath29 then the measurement basis of the optimal strategy is not the fourier basis , but is in some way similar  to the haar basis ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite for this notion ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the problem of state estimation discussed in the paper . in section 3",
    "we sketch the related previous works . in section 4",
    "we tackle the problem of estimating the direction of the bloch vector of a qubit @xmath8 sampled from a uniform distribution on a given small circle , when are supplied states of the form @xmath45 . in section 5",
    "we consider the case in which the supplied states are of the form @xmath32 , where @xmath8 and @xmath28 are respectively from two parallel circles and in one - to - one correspondence with each other .",
    "in section 6 we consider the case of a qubit @xmath8 sampled from a uniform distribution on two diametrically opposite circles and the supplied states are either @xmath9 or @xmath10 . in section 7",
    "we describe an locc protocol for optimally estimating the direction of a qubit @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is fixed ) , when a pair of parallel qubits is supplied .",
    "section 8 is devoted to discussion and open problems .",
    "let us consider a quantum mechanical system with associated hilbert space @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 be a set of indices ( not necessarily countable ) and let @xmath50 be a set of normalized pure states .",
    "this is equivalent to say that each @xmath51 is of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath5 and @xmath54 are complex numbers such that @xmath55 .",
    "suppose that we want to gather information about an unknown state @xmath56 .",
    "once we have chosen , and fixed , an orthonormal basis of @xmath5 , say @xmath57 , information about the coefficients @xmath58 is obtained by performing measurements on the state @xmath59 .",
    "the mathematical description of a general measurement on a quantum state is the _ positive operator valued measurement _ ( povm ) formalism .",
    "this is described as follows .",
    "let @xmath60 be a set of indices ( not necessarily finite ) .",
    "a povm @xmath61 on @xmath5 is a set of positive operators @xmath62 such that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the identity operator in @xmath5 .",
    "the probability that the @xmath65-th measurement outcome occurs is given by @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 is the state before the measurement ) . for all practical purposes @xmath60",
    "is taken to be finite .",
    "in such a case , since the hilbert space @xmath5 is finite dimensional , it follows by a theorem of davies @xcite that the elements of @xmath68 can be chosen to be of rank one . in this paper , we consider povms with rank one elements only . as a matter of fact full information about @xmath69 is obtained only by performing measurements on an infinite number of copies of @xmath59 . since it is physically impossible to be supplied with an infinite number of copies of a quantum state , we assume that we are supplied with @xmath70 copies of @xmath59 only .",
    "now , let @xmath71 be a set of indices ( not necessarily countable ) and let @xmath72 be a set of normalized pure states in @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that there is a bijective function @xmath74 .",
    "a _ state estimation strategy _",
    "@xmath75 is composed of :    * a povm on @xmath73 , @xmath76 ; * a set of density matrices @xmath77 .",
    "if the @xmath65-th outcome of a measurement performed by applying @xmath68 to a given @xmath78 occurs , the system is then prepared in the state @xmath79 .",
    "this is said to be the _ estimated state _ from the @xmath65-th measurement outcome . for any @xmath78 ,",
    "the _ average estimated state _ of the system is given by@xmath80 thus , the _ fidelity _ for @xmath75 to estimate the state @xmath81 is @xmath82 , and the _ average fidelity _ for @xmath75 to estimate states in @xmath33 is given by @xmath83 is a generalized measure over @xmath71 .",
    "then , using the above expression for @xmath84 , we have@xmath85 in this last equation , we can replace @xmath86 with a @xmath87$]-valued parameter depending on @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "such a parameter , denoted by @xmath90 , is called the _",
