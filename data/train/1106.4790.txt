    "ngc 4203 is a lenticular galaxy located at a distance of 15.14 mpc @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is of interest because it harbors a low ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of type 1.9 indicating that it exhibits a broad h@xmath1 emission line @xcite . high angular resolution observations with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) _ aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) revealed that the broad h@xmath1 emission line is actually double - peaked @xcite with a fwzi of @xmath9 12,000 km / s .",
    "ngc 4203 was observed with _ stis _",
    "again 11 years later revealing a significantly brighter double - peaked broad h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "thus , ngc 4203 joins a short but growing list of liners with time variable broad balmer emission lines of which the best studied nearby example is ngc 1097 @xcite but also includes m81 @xcite and ngc 3065 @xcite .",
    "ngc 4203 also hosts a time variable , compact core , flat - spectrum radio source @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the nucleus of ngc 4203 is also variable in the ultra - violet ( uv ) .",
    "however , variability has yet to be established in x - rays @xcite .",
    "@xcite compiled the radio - to - x - ray spectral energy distribution of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) showing that it resembles more luminous seyferts .",
    "several attempts have been made to estimate the black hole ( bh ) mass using spatially resolved gas kinematics @xcite with mixed results .",
    "subsequently , @xcite adopted the stellar velocity dispersion measurement of @xcite to estimate a bh mass of ( 6 @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 , which , when compared to the bolometric luminosity , indicates that ngc 4203 radiates well below , @xmath910@xmath13 , of the eddington luminosity limit @xcite .",
    "accretion disks are expected to produce broad emission lines with characteristics that , in principle , betray their geometries @xcite .",
    "for example , disks of low inclination are predicted to produce an asymmetric profile with the blue peak brighter than the red @xcite . as the disk becomes more edge - on",
    ", the blue and red peaks achieve a similar brightness and may even merge into a single peak if the disk has a large ratio of outer radius to inner radius as may be the case in ngc 3065 @xcite . however , disk models invariably are unable to simultaneously explain both the broad shoulders and the bright core of broad line emission often seen centered at the systemic velocity of the galaxy @xcite , especially in nearby galaxies observed with high angular resolution . for example , in ngc 4579 , ngc 4450 and ngc 4203 , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively , attribute the central core emission to a _  normal \" _ broad component .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite ascribe the broad h@xmath1 emission lines seen in distant quasars and broad line radio galaxies in terms of an accretion disk and a _  standard \" _ or _  classical \" _ broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "however , labeling the single peak of core emission as the _  normal \" _ , _  standard \" _ or _  classical \" _ blr does not necessarily entail an explanation of what it is exactly .",
    "there are two possibilities ; it is either an inflow or an outflow .",
    "radiatively driven outflows are not possible , however , in liners , because they radiate well below the eddington luminosity limit .",
    "thus , inflow is the only remaining explanation for the central core emission seen in liners with double - peaked profiles .",
    "this paper is the third in a series that attempts to model the broad emission line profiles for low luminosity agns ( llagns ) with known central masses and derive a size for the blr .",
    "inflows can produce the single peaked broad emission line profiles seen in m81 and ngc 3998 @xcite and inflows are expected to be associated with accretion disks , because the former , presumably , fuels that latter .",
    "an objective of this paper , therefore , is to demonstrate the utility of an _ inflow plus disk model _ to explain double peaked broad emission line profiles with central core emission and , by way of illustration , apply this combined model to interpret the time - variable broad balmer emission lines seen in ngc 4203 .",
    "the wider context for this investigation is to better understand the broad line phenomenon in llagns by characterizing their physical properties using archival _ hst - stis _ spectroscopy .",
    "ngc 4203 is an excellent candidate to study as it is nearby , bright and radiates well below the eddington luminosity limit and is therefore unable to sustain a radiatively driven outflow thereby simplifying the interpretation of the broad emission lines by eliminating one of the possible explanations for their origin .",
    "since the blr is unresolved , the spatial distribution of emission can not be directly measured .",
    "however , the three dimensional gravitational field strength is known , by virtue of the bh mass , thus the relationship between velocity and radius may be established , given a kinematic model for the broad emission line gas . in this way",
    ", one can , in principle , exploit the exquisite velocity resolution of @xmath14 to model the broad emission line profiles and determine a size for the blr that heretofore has previously only been possible using reverberation mapping techniques @xcite .",
    "profile fitting complements reverberation mapping as the latter yields blr sizes for a different sample of more luminous agns .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 3 , the bels seen in ngc 4203 are evaluated in the context of an inflow plus disk model .",
    "some physical properties of the blr are presented in section 4 .",
    "conclusions follow in section 5 .",
    "we begin , however , with section 2 and a review of the emission lines observed in the nucleus of ngc 4203 .",
    "ngc 4203 has been observed with _ stis _ twice using the g750 m grating and once using the g430l grating .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observations and the archival spectra are presented in fig 1 .",
    "spectrum showing the broad h@xmath1 emission line has been presented previously by @xcite based on observations obtained under pid 7361 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have all presented the g430l spectrum obtained under pid 7361 .",
    "however , the g750 m spectrum obtained under pid 11571 is shown for the first time in fig . 1 .",
    "multiple exposures obtained using the same grating and at the same position have been combined using the * stsdas * task * ocrreject*. dithered exposures were shifted using the * stsdas * task * sshift * prior to combining .",
    "subsequently , the * stsdas * task * x1d * was used to perform a 7 pixel wide extraction along the slit direction and centered on the nucleus .",
    "each extraction samples @xmath15 80% of the encircled energy for an unresolved point source @xcite .",
    "the g750 m spectra reveal a broad h@xmath1 line with a fwhm @xmath2 3000 km / s that brightened by more than a factor of two in the almost 11 year interval since the first spectrum was obtained .",
    "two narrow but resolved [ s ii ] lines appear on the red side of the broad h@xmath1 line at @xmath2 6750 and two narrow but resolved [ o i ] lines appear on the blue side at @xmath2 6350 .",
    "these narrow lines are virtually identical in the two datasets .",
    "thus , the brightening appears to be limited to just the broad h@xmath1 + [ n ii ] emission line complex which is remarkable because the more recent observations were obtained with a smaller 0.1 slit .",
    "the g430l spectrum reveals a wide swath of emission lines .",
    "collectively , the g750 m and g430l spectra resolve the h@xmath1 , h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 lines . a more detailed description of the spectra follows , beginning with the hydrogen ( h ) balmer lines .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission line profile exhibits broad shoulders that are accentuated in the 2010 spectrum compared to the one obtained in 1999 .",
    "both of the [ n ii ] vacuum wavelength 6549.85 and 6585.28  emission lines and the narrow component of the vacuum wavelength 6564.61 h@xmath1 emission line can be seen in a 7 pixel extraction centered on the nucleus in both datasets which greatly facilitates their modeling .",
    "the @xmath18 contributed task @xmath19 was used to model and subtract the forbidden lines and the results are reported in table 2 along with the fluxes for the two [ s ii ] vacuum wavelength @xmath206718.29 and @xmath206732.67  emission lines and the two [ o i ] vacuum wavelength @xmath206302.04 and @xmath206365.53  emission lines .",
    "the flux for the model [ n ii ] lines and the model @xmath21 h@xmath1 line has been chosen so that the difference spectrum does not show an ` over - subtraction ' of the broad h@xmath1 profile . the procedure is valid because the observed broad h@xmath1 emission line profile is otherwise smoothly varying . in support of the procedure ,",
    "the model parameters deduced for the [ n ii ] lines are consistent with the expectation based on atomic physics that sets the wavelength of the fainter [ n ii ] line relative to the brighter [ n ii ] line , constrains the flux of the fainter [ n ii ] line to be 1/3 that of the brighter [ n ii ] line , and requires that the [ n ii ] lines share the same width . two components were required to model the brightest [ n ii ] line in order to obtain a satisfactory subtraction as noted in table 2 .",
    "a single gaussian was used to model the other lines .",
    "the brightest [ o i ] line is wider than the brightest [ n ii ] line at the @xmath2 90% confidence level .",
    "that these forbidden lines have similar widths and further that the narrow h@xmath1 line is fainter than the brightest [ n ii ] line are characteristics shared by other agns observed with _",
    "stis _ for which these lines can be clearly seen @xcite .",
    "a model narrow line spectrum is illustrated in fig . 2 along with the difference spectrum which reveals a broad h@xmath1 line profile that is very similar to the h@xmath16 line described in the next section .",
    "figure 2 illustrates that the consequence of subtracting the forbidden emission line model is to reveal a broad h@xmath1 emission line symmetric about the @xmath206588 wavelength expected for a systemic velocity of 1077 km / s deduced from the peak of the brightest [ n ii ] emission line .",
    "thus , there is no apparent redshift between the broad h@xmath1 emission line and the systemic redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "the broad h@xmath1 emission line flux deduced from the 1999 g750 m spectra is @xmath2 40% larger than estimated previously by @xcite .",
    "the difference can be attributed to the fact that @xcite subtracted not only the forbidden emission lines described above , but also another component that they call the _  normal \" _ broad line emission centered at the systemic velocity of the galaxy . comparing",
    "the entire h@xmath1 emission line flux measured in the 2010 spectrum with that measured for the 1999 spectrum indicates that the broad line increased in brightness by a factor of 2.2 .",
    "the h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 emission lines are compromised only slightly by [ o iii ] emission lines which were modeled and subtracted using the @xmath18 contributed task @xmath19 as illustrated in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "the [ o iii ] vacuum wavelength @xmath204364.44  deserved special attention as it is very faint and marginally resolved .",
    "a model was employed for the [ o iii ] @xmath204364.44 line in which the wavelength and line width was fixed and the flux adjusted so as to not over - subtract the h@xmath17 line in the difference spectrum ( fig .",
    "this yielded the upper limit for the [ o iii ] @xmath20 4364.44 line reported in table 3 .",
    "subtracting the [ o iii ] lines reveals broad h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 emission lines .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis can not reliably be extended to include other balmer lines as they are even fainter and even more confused with emission from other ions .",
    "consequently , emission line fluxes are reported in table 3 for all the lines that can be reliably resolved and measured in the g430l spectrum including h@xmath16 , h@xmath17 , the blend of the vacuum wavelength @xmath223727.09 , 3729.88  [ o ii ] lines , the two [ o iii ] vacuum wavelength @xmath204960.30  and @xmath205008.24  emission lines , and the upper limit for the vacuum wavelength @xmath204364.44  [ o iii ] emission line . according to the diagnostic diagram of (",
    "* their fig .",
    "5 ) the [ o iii ] @xmath205008.24 /[o ii ] @xmath223727.09 , 3729.88 and [ o i ] @xmath206324.99/h@xmath1 emission line ratios measured with _ stis _ in 1999 qualify ngc 4203 as a seyfert and the difference between the permitted and forbidden line widths further qualifies ngc 4203 as a seyfert 1 .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the striking similarity between the h@xmath1 and h@xmath16 lines in ngc 4203 when they are normalized to their respective peak intensities and the wavelength scales converted to velocity using the non - relativistic doppler equation .",
    "the similarity between the emission line profiles is particularly impressive considering the variety of models employed to subtract the superimposed forbidden lines . on the other hand",
    ", the h@xmath17 line profile is quite different in the sense that the line core appears to be broader and the broad shoulders are absent , particularly noticeable on the blue side .",
    "it is not clear whether the difference between the h@xmath17 profile and the other balmer lines is a consequence of lower signal - to - noise data for this weak line or whether it represents a real radiative transfer effect .",
    "nevertheless , the broad shoulders on the h@xmath1 and h@xmath16 lines suggest an accretion disk , as noted previously by @xcite , whereas the line core is similar to what would be expected for a spherically symmetric shell of gas in radial motion as noted previously by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each of these models will be described further in section 3 .      despite the similarity between the broad h@xmath1 and h@xmath16 line profiles , the balmer decrement , h@xmath1/h@xmath16",
    "= 5.0 @xmath23 0.1 is significantly different from the case b value , 2.75 , in the sense that the observed value is systematically 182% higher . interpreting this ratio in terms of dust extinction leads to a color excess @xmath24 @xmath2 0.6 mag which is inconsistent with the reddening estimated to the agn x - ray emission by @xcite .",
    "such deviations from recombination theory have been noted for other liners ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have been attributed to collisional excitation in gas of high density or time variable dust extinction .",
    "as alluded to in the introduction and in section 2.0.3 , the broad h@xmath1 ( and h@xmath16 ) line profiles can be modeled using the combination of an accretion disk _ and _ an inflow since neither model alone is able to explain the entire broad emission line . the disk model , described previously by @xcite , describes the emission expected from a thin axisymmetric , relativistic accretion disk .",
    "the model includes self - consistently all relevant relativistic effects , such as doppler boosting and transverse and gravitational redshifts and involves five free parameters , a dimensionless inner radius , @xmath25 , and outer radius , @xmath26 , an inclination angle measured from the disk normal to the line of sight , @xmath27 , an emissivity law of the form @xmath28 , and a velocity dispersion for the gas , @xmath29 in km / s . the inflow model has been described most recently by @xcite . it describes a steady state spherically symmetric infall and invokes just two free parameters , an inner and outer radius ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "collectively , the disk plus inflow model encompass 8 free parameters if one includes the scaling that determines the relative contribution of the disk and inflow to the total line emission ( see tables 4 & 5 ) .",
    "illustrative models presented in fig .",
    "6 show that the broad h@xmath1 line profile observed in 1999 is dominated by the inflow with only a small contribution from the disk , except at the extremities of the line",
    ". however , the situation is quite different for the broad h@xmath1 line profile observed in 2010 which , according to the model , appears to be dominated by the accretion disk , except in the line core .",
    "the inflow model parameters are chosen to be the same for the 1999 and 2010 data , motivated by the fact that the narrow lines , including the narrow component of the h@xmath1 line , did not change between 1999 and 2010 .",
    "thus , only the disk changed .",
    "experimentation revealed that the 2010 h@xmath1 line profile is best modeled with a ratio of outer to inner disk radius , @xmath26/@xmath25 = 3.75 , a velocity dispersion , @xmath29 = 350 km / s and an emissivity index , q=3 .",
    "a more thorough exploration of the parameter space was performed by computing the value of @xmath32 for a grid of 156 models per epoch spanning 26 inclinations between 40@xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath34 90@xmath33 , and 6 values for the inner radius spanning 500 @xmath34 @xmath25 @xmath34 3000 , expressed in units of the gravitational radius , @xmath36 = gm@xmath37 .",
    "the remaining parameters are fixed as listed in table 4 .",
    "@xmath38    where @xmath39 represents the observed normalized line profile intensities , @xmath40 , the model normalized line profile intensities , @xmath41 is the number of degrees of freedom and @xmath42 the uncertainty in the observed normalized line profile intensities , taken to be 4% for both epochs .",
    "the summation was performed over the velocity span of the broad h@xmath1 line as specified in table 5 .",
    "the minimum @xmath32 computed for the 2010 data was unity indicating that the axis - symmetric disk plus inflow model provided an excellent representation of those data .",
    "a contour plot of the @xmath32 surface , presented in figure 7 , shows that there are multiple combinations of disk inclination and inner radius that can minimize @xmath32 for each epoch .",
    "thus , the model representations of the data presented in fig . 6 are by no means unique .",
    "however , the fact that the red and blue @xmath43 contours do not overlap suggests that there is no single disk model that can simultaneously explain both the 1999 and 2010 observations .",
    "there could even be two disks .",
    "but , the most conservative interpretation is that there is just one disk for which the inclination did not change between 1999 and 2010 . in this case",
    "the size of the disk must have changed .",
    "the arrow in fig .",
    "7 represents the @xmath44 size evolution solution which implies that the disk is highly inclined , @xmath35 = 82@xmath33 @xmath23 1@xmath33 , which presumably aided in its detection , and the inner radius of the disk decreased from 2770@xmath36 @xmath23 182@xmath36 in 1999 to 2200@xmath36 @xmath23 216@xmath36 in 2010 , the implications of which are discussed further in section 4.7 .",
    "that the inflow plus disk model is able to reproduce the rather complex shapes observed for the broad h@xmath1 emission line profiles in ngc 4203 allows the sizes of the inflow and disk components to be estimated .",
    "the mass distribution determines that the size of the inflow is large ; @xmath2 2 pc ( 27 milli - arcsec ) in diameter and it terminates at the much smaller @xmath2 14 @xmath6 10@xmath45 pc ( 200 @xmath46arcsec ) diameter disk .    the physical size inferred for the inflow and the disk components causes ngc 4203 to not conform to the correlation between blr size and uv luminosity established for quasars and high luminosity agns using reverberation mapping @xcite .",
    "an extrapolation of the blr size - luminosity relationship of @xcite down to the low uv luminosity estimated for the agn in ngc 4203 , predicts a radius for the blr that is @xmath2 0.5 l.d , which is @xmath2 20 times smaller than inferred for the inner radius of the disk using line profile fitting ( section 3 ) .",
    "conversely , the large outer radius determined for the inflow in ngc 4203 using profile fitting makes it physically larger than any blr measured using reverberation mapping , 4 times larger than the previous record holder ; the quasar 3c 273 @xcite .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , the blr size ",
    "luminosity correlation appears to break down for low luminosity agns , which , with l(2500 @xmath47 ) = 4.4 @xmath6 10@xmath48 erg / s @xcite , would include ngc 4203 .",
    "of course , the blr size  luminosity relationship of @xcite is defined by quasars and agns that are orders of magnitude more luminous than ngc 4203 .",
    "thus , the very large discrepancy arising from the comparison strongly suggests that the blr in ngc 4203 is not simply that of a scaled down quasar .      estimating the mass of the bh in ngc 4203 using the so called ` virial method ' leads to a value that is substantially lower than the mass estimated from the stellar velocity dispersion by @xcite .",
    "for example , the formalism of @xcite , which uses the fwhm _ and _ luminosity of the broad h@xmath1 emission line , underestimates the mass of the bh in ngc 4203 by a factor of 348 using the broad h@xmath1 emission line observed in 1999 and a factor of 51 using the one observed in 2010 .",
    "this dichotomy is regarded as further evidence that the blr in ngc 4203 is very different from the blr in more luminous agns .",
    "following @xcite , the ionizing continuum generated by the agn in ngc 4203 may be represented as a power law with an optical to x - ray spectral index @xmath1 = 1.11 and a normalization provided by the uv continuum described in section 4.1 .",
    "integrating the spectral energy distribution from 13.6 ev to 100 kev using the method described previously in @xcite predicts 1.7 x @xmath49 ionizing ph / s after correcting for 0.05 mag of galactic extinction only . for comparison , the broad h@xmath1 emission line flux measured in 1999 ( table 2 ) which is dominated by the inflow ( fig .",
    "6 ) corresponds to an h@xmath1 luminosity , @xmath50 ) = 1.14 @xmath610@xmath4 l@xmath8 , which , assuming 45% of the ionizing photons are converted into h@xmath1 photons ( case b recombination at a temperature of 10@xmath51 k ) requires ( 3.2 @xmath52 0.04 ) x @xmath49 ionizing ph / s using ,    @xmath53    where @xmath54 = 1.16 x 10@xmath55 @xmath56 s@xmath57 is the effective recombination coefficient and @xmath58 = 2.59 x 10@xmath55 @xmath56 s@xmath57 is the total case b recombination coefficient .",
    "thus , the number of ionizing photons required to excite the broad h@xmath1 emission line measured in 1999 exceeds the number of ionizing photons available from the agn by a factor @xmath2 2 , independent of the gas density and the filling factor . the discrepancy becomes larger for the brighter h@xmath1 emission line measured in 2010 .",
    "then the number of ionizing photons required to excite the h@xmath1 emission line exceeds that available from the agn by a factor of @xmath2 4 .",
    "technically , these are upper limits because the agn is variable in the uv and could have brightened prior to and since 2003 when it was last measured @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , tentatively , ngc 4203 joins m81 and ngc 4579 as examples of liners with a blr _ ionizing deficit _ @xcite .      the size of the aperture employed to extract the spectra illustrated in fig .",
    "1 encompasses emission from gas up to a radial distance of 13 pc from the central agn where the velocity dispersion is expected to be @xmath2 200 km / s and comparable to that measured for the [ s ii ] lines .",
    "thus , the two [ s ii ] lines provide an opportunity to measure the gas density well beyond the outer boundary of the inflow . the nominal value for the observed [ s ii ] @xmath206742/@xmath206757 intensity ratio = 0.68 @xmath23 0.1 , corresponding to n = 2 @xmath6 10@xmath59 @xmath5 , with uncertainties permitting densities in the range 1 @xmath60 n ( 10@xmath59 @xmath5 ) @xmath60 6 .",
    "the fact that the fwhm of the broad h@xmath1 and h@xmath16 emission lines is larger than that of the [ o i ] and [ o iii ] emission lines ( table 2 & 3 ) means that the gas density @xmath61 the inflow must be greater than the critical density of the levels from which the [ o i ] and [ o iii ] lines originate which is @xmath210@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "this limit is higher than the one obtained from the [ s ii ] line ratio implying that the gas density increases towards the central bh .",
    "the mass of emitting gas may be deduced from the broad h@xmath1 emission line luminosity assuming standard ( case b ) recombination theory ;    @xmath62    using an effective recombination coefficient @xmath54 = 1.16 x 10@xmath55 @xmath56 s@xmath57 , assuming a _ constant _ average density n @xmath15 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , and a luminosity @xmath63 ) = 1.14 x 10@xmath64 l@xmath8 based on the broad line flux measured in 1999 ( table 2 ) , leads to an upper limit on the mass of inflowing ionized gas , @xmath65 @xmath34 10 m@xmath8 . if only a fraction of the gas is ionized then the upper limit on the _ total _ ( ionized + neutral ) gas mass could , of course , be higher .",
    "it is straight forward to calculate the volume filling factor , @xmath66 , for the ionized gas producing the h@xmath1 emission once the dimensions of the emitting region have been established . for a uniform density medium occupying a spherical volume of radius @xmath67",

    "the very low filling factor suggests that the inflow is not continuous but composed of many ionized , density bounded , gas filaments .",
    "such filaments would have approximately the same gas density and hence the same emissivity regardless of their location with respect to the central agn , they would be optically thin and hence emit isotropically",
    ". ionized gas filaments embrace all the essential elements of the inflow model and are commonly seen in the nuclei of active galaxies @xcite including the central parsec of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "consequently , the inflow modeled here is not a bondi flow @xcite because the inflowing ` particles ' are discrete and do not constitute a continuous fluid .",
    "having established the dimensions of the emitting region and a lower limit on the gas density one can estimate the mass inflow rate , @xmath72 , for the ionized gas observed in 1999 , using the equation of continuity ;    @xmath73    the free - fall velocity , v , at a radius of 1 pc is determined by the mass distribution to be 730 km / s . setting @xmath70 @xmath34 1 x 10@xmath71 for a self - consistent gas density in the flow of n @xmath1510@xmath4 @xmath5 ( see section 4.4 ) , one obtains a mass inflow rate , @xmath72 @xmath2 2.4 @xmath6 10@xmath7 m@xmath8/yr . however , if only a fraction of the inflowing gas is ionized , then the _ total _ mass inflow rate could , of course , be higher .",
    "the 110 kev x - ray luminosity adopted for the agn in ngc 4203 , @xmath74 , is @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "assuming this is powered by radiatively inefficient accretion leads to the following formula @xcite    @xmath76    where @xmath77@xmath78 is in @xmath79 and @xmath80@xmath81 is in solar masses . under these circumstances the accretion rate required to power the observed x - ray emission , @xmath82",
    "thus , the steady state spherically symmetric inflow inferred from the broad h@xmath1 line emission seen in 1999 exceeds the requirement to explain the x - ray luminosity in terms of radiatively inefficient accretion by a factor of @xmath2 6 .",
    "the most obvious source for the inflowing material is stellar - mass loss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the caveat that it is only the gas for which the vector cross product    @xmath83    where r is the radius vector and p is the linear momentum of the gas , will be accreted by the bh .",
    "this is expected to limit the accretion rate to the values @xmath60 0.1 @xmath84 measured for the inflows in m81 @xcite , ngc 3998 @xcite and ngc 4203 studied here .",
    "there are four indications that the accretion disk modeled in ngc 4203 is not , in fact , an accretion disk .",
    "first , the fwhm and the total broad line flux both increased between 1999 and 2010 ( table 2 ) which is contrary to the expected behavior for a disk subjected to a brightening of the central agn ( see for example , the discussion of 3c 332 in * ? ? ?",
    "second , there was likely no associated brightening of the central agn as discussed further in the latter part of this section .",
    "third , the disk is more appropriately described as a ring given the small ratio of outer to inner radius deduced from the model ( table 4 ) .",
    "fourth , the inner radius of the ring apparently decreased in size by @xmath2 20% between 1999 and 2010 . collectively , these observations suggest that we are witnessing a tidal disruption event unfolding in ngc 4203 .",
    "tidally disrupted solar - type stars are unlikely candidates as the inner radius of the ring ( 1687 au in 1999 and 1340 au in 2010 ) is about a factor of 10@xmath85 larger than the tidal radius expected for a 1 m@xmath12 main sequence star in the vicinity of a 6 @xmath6 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 bh .",
    "however , the tidal radius increases for objects of lower density . for example , the tidal radius , r@xmath86 at which co - rotating objects of density , @xmath87 are disrupted by a bh of mass , m@xmath88 is given by      thus , the average density of an object that will be tidally disrupted at a distance similar to the inner radius deduced for the ring ( section 3 ) , corresponds to @xmath2 10@xmath90 @xmath91 , comparable to the average density expected for a late - type supergiant star , similar to betelgeuse for example .",
    "consequently , it is quite plausible that the brightening of the double - peaked broad lines in ngc 4203 was caused by the ongoing tidal disruption of a red supergiant star which would have made @xmath2 1.5 orbits in the time span of the _ stis _ observations ( see * ? ?",
    "* for evidence that red supergiant stars exist in s0 galaxies ) .    in the tidal disruption scenario ,",
    "the average density of ionized gas responsible for the double - peaked broad h@xmath1 emission line is likely to be comparable to the outer atmosphere of betelgeuse for which n @xmath2 5 @xmath6 10@xmath92 @xmath5 @xcite , high enough , perhaps , to explain the anomalous balmer decrement noted in section 2.0.4 .",
    "the mass of gas can be estimated using equation 2 , an effective recombination coefficient @xmath54 = 1.16 x 10@xmath55 @xmath56 s@xmath57 and a luminosity @xmath63 ) = 1.38 x 10@xmath64 l@xmath8 , based on the _ difference _ between the broad line flux measured in 2010 and 1999 which should more closely represent that produced by just the ring in 2010 .",
    "the resulting mass of ionized gas corresponds to @xmath2 2 @xmath6 10@xmath93 m@xmath12 and is presumably strewn in a ring shaped contrail marking the trajectory of the supergiant much as envisaged by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig . 1 ) and ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "more recently @xcite describe objects shaped like comets orbiting and eclipsing the central x - ray source in ngc 1365 .",
    "the defining characteristics of their `` comets ''  a dense head and low mass tail  are intriguingly similar to the those proposed here for the supergiant producing the stellar - contrail in ngc 4203 .",
    "it was noted in section 4.3 that ngc 4203 suffers from an ionizing deficit that was particularly acute in 2010 .",
    "the deficit could be alleviated if the agn had brightened by a factor of 4 since 2003 , but this is unlikely as the amplitude of the uv variability is @xmath2 50% at the shortest wavelength when it was measured by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can not appeal to a boost of x - rays as no x - ray variability has been detected @xcite .",
    "however , the broad h@xmath1 line emission observed in 2010 is dominated by the double - peaked broad line component that is attributed to the tidal disruption event .",
    "thus , it is quite conceivable that ram pressure shock ionization produced by the interaction of the in - falling supergiant star with the ambient interstellar medium could provide an additional _ mechanical _ source of ionization that would help alleviate the ionizing deficit noted for ngc 4203 .",
    "note that ram pressure ionization is a very different mechanism for exciting the contrail than proposed by @xcite which appeals to external _ flares _ generated by material as it is accreted onto the bh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ram pressure ionization is produced _ in - situ_. although ram pressure ionization was discussed previously in the context of the tail of ionized gas leaving the galactic center m supergiant irs 7 @xcite there is a need to explicitly model the tidal disruption of a supergiant star as existing studies have tended to focus on solar type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ have revealed a time variable double - peaked broad h@xmath1 emission line profile in ngc 4203 which has been successfully modeled as the combination of a _ time variable disk plus a steady state inflow_. in this model the broad h@xmath1 line emission observed in 1999 is dominated by the inflow which is large , @xmath2 2 pc in diameter , and likely sustained by stellar mass loss . if the gas density is high , @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , as suggested by the absence of similarly broad [ o i ] and [ o iii ] emission lines , then interpreting the broad h@xmath1 emission line observed in 1999 leads to a steady state inflow rate @xmath2 2 @xmath6 10@xmath7 m@xmath8/yr which exceeds the requirement to explain the x - ray luminosity in terms of radiatively inefficient accretion by a factor of @xmath2 6 .",
    "the time variable double - peaked component of the broad h@xmath1 emission line , which is particularly impressive in the 2010 spectrum , has been modeled as an axis - symmetric disk , more appropriately described as a narrow ring , leading to the conclusion that it most likely represents the contrail of a supergiant star that is being tidally disrupted by the central bh .",
    "the agn is apparently unable to sustain the ionization of the broad h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "the discrepancy is particularly acute in 2010 unless the agn had brightened by a factor of 4 since 2003 which seems unlikely .",
    "ram pressure shock ionization produced by the interaction of the in - falling supergiant star with the ambient interstellar medium could provide an additional mechanical source of ionization that would help alleviate the ionizing deficit noted for ngc 4203 .",
