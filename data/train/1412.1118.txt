    "one of the most intriguing aspects of exoplanet science is the prospect of finding worlds around other stars that might be capable of hosting life as we know it .",
    "this translates into a search for terrestrial planets in the so - called habitable zones ( hzs ) , i.e. circumstellar regions where an earth - analog is capable of sustaining liquid water on its surface .",
    "finding planets in such zones does not automatically mean that they are habitable , though .",
    "the complex interplay between insolation , atmosphere , lithosphere and hydrosphere necessitates a determination of most planetary , stellar and orbital properties in order to judge potential habitability .",
    "hence , each newly discovered candidate has to be assessed on an individual basis .",
    "this , of course , raises questions on the purpose and usefulness of the hz concept .",
    "yet , we believe that providing planet hunters with guidelines on where to look for potentially habitable worlds remains important , as long as observational resources are limited .",
    "this implies that predicted hz borders have to be translatable into detectability domains for the respective exoplanet detection methods .",
    "hz estimates should , therefore , contain reasonably detailed assumptions on the physical processes underlying planetary habitability .",
    "we argue , for instance , that dynamically induced changes in a planet s orbit can substantially change habitability conditions .",
    "if quantifiable , they should not be neglected in hz calculations .",
    "so far , considerable efforts have been spent on investigating climatic stability of earth - like planets leading to largely accepted estimates on the amount and spectral distribution of insolation that can render a world uninhabitable @xcite .",
    "recent so - called `` effective insolation '' limits can be found , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "naturally , globally averaged climate models such as used by the previously named authors can not account for all effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they can be considered a reasonable first approximation for earth - like planets that are far from the tidal - lock or tidal - heating regime . alas , hz borders can be calculated by solving the simultaneous equations : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the insolation at the top of the atmosphere , @xmath2 is the luminosity of the star , @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the effective insolation limits for the inner and outer edge of the hz , and @xmath5 $ ] refers to the solar constant . for the sun and an earth - like planet @xcite predict @xmath6 and @xmath7 , resulting in the following hz limits expressed as distances @xmath8 from the host star : @xmath9 au and @xmath10 au .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) describes a spherical shell around the host star where planets can populate orbits that respect the insolation limits necessary for habitability .",
    "yet , what if the planet leaves this shell from time to time ?",
    "this may happen when the planet s orbit is elliptic .",
    "then , the top of the atmosphere insolation can vary considerably with time , see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "@xcite could show that planets with earth - like oceans can compensate climatic extremes due to excursion outside the classical hzs ( henceforth chz , not to be confused with the continuous habitable zone ) , as long as the average insolation stays within habitable limits .",
    "later studies indicate , however , that the role of planetary eccentricity and its influence on insolation can not easily be discarded ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we , thus , propose a way to include available information on the variability of planetary insolation directly into habitability considerations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the possible existence of terrestrial planets in and around binary star systems @xcite has rekindled the scientific community s interest in determining habitable zones ( hz ) in and around binary star systems @xcite . given the strong gravitational perturbations planets experience in such environments , significant variations in planetary orbits can be expected .",
    "even if planets formed on circular orbits , for instance , the interaction with the binary would force the planet s orbital eccentricity become non - zero over time .",
    "as was shown in e.g. @xcite the momentary hz for binary star systems are solutions of the two simultaneous planetary insolation equations normalized with respect to effective insolation limits . in compact notation",
    "that is @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the respective effective insolation limits that serve as spectral weighting factors and @xmath14 are the stellar luminosities ; @xmath15 is the normalized total insolation at the inner ( @xmath16 ) and outer ( @xmath17 ) border of the combined hz , and @xmath18 represent the time dependent planet - to - star distances . for double star systems we have @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite derived a similar expression .",
    "note , however , that two different sets of @xmath20 parameters , one for the inner and one for the outer hz border are required to simultaneously fulfill the inequalities in their equation  ( 5 )",
    ". momentary hzs depend on the current relative positions of the stars and the planet .",
    "they tend to fluctuate on orbital and secular timescales . deriving observational constraints from time dependent hzs can",
    ", thus , be difficult ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to include information on the variability of planetary insolation",
    ", we apply the hz scheme defined in section 2 and predict planetary insolation and hz limits analytically using recent results from perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this allows us to model the earth - analog s orbit and insolation evolution as a function of the system s initial parameters @xcite . as can be seen in figure [ fig2 ] , phz and ehz and ahz",
    "behave quite differently for various orbital configurations of a terrestrial planet in a binary star system . in all studied binary systems",
    "a clear decrease in the extent of the phz and ehz can be observed for growing eccentricities of the binary s orbit .",
    "of course , not only the binary s eccentricity , also its semi - major axis greatly influences the extent of permanently habitable regions .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig2 ] shows that the phz can be considerably smaller than the chz for circumbinary planets ( p - type ) , even if both the binary s and the planet s orbit are initially circular .",
    "the ahz are mostly identical with chzs . only in regions close to the system s stability limits deviations in s - type as well as p - type systems",
    "our hz estimates have , furthermore , been applied to well characterized s - type binary stars close to the solar system @xcite .",
    "it was found that most systems do not only allow for habitability in an average sense , they even retain zones of permanent habitability .",
    "the complex interplay between dynamical and radiative influences can turn the determination of habitable zones ( hz ) in gravitationally interacting systems into a challenging affair . flexibility and adaptability",
    "should , thus , be considered important properties of any hz calculation scheme .",
    "we argue that a minimum dynamical model should be included in hz calculations to ensure realistic estimates .",
    "the proposed classification scheme ( phz , ehz and ahz ) retains information on the variability of planetary insolation while providing hz boundaries that remain valid up to stellar evolution timescales .",
    "it is flexible with respect to changes in atmospheric models as well as the choice of the underlying dynamical model .",
    "an alternative to time consuming numerical insolation calculations , the analytical estimates presented in @xcite can help to shed light onto the diverse kinds of habitability occurring for terrestrial planets in gravitationally active systems .",
    "their application to nearby s - type binary stars has shown that most of these systems allow for hzs in spite of their strong gravitational interactions and variable insolation conditions .",
