    "obviously the high and low state spectra can not be described simply by a renormalization of a single power law model . despite the fact that most of the flux change between 2006 and 2007 occurs at lower energies , the soft x - ray spectral slopes in the 2006 and 2007 _ xmm - newton _   observations are similar . from a broken power law model",

    "this test can show if the same underlying continuum spectrum can be applied to the data only affected by the absorber column density and covering fraction .",
    "the first test was to use a model with two power laws ( replacing the broken power law ) and one partial covering absorber .",
