    "standard model ( sm ) is successful theory of gauge interactions , however higgs sector is not examined well .",

    "many unsolved puzzles of sm are left in these sectors ; that is , _ e.g. _ , why is the structure of mixing matrix of leptons ( maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix , @xmath4 ) very different from that of the mixing matrix of quarks ( cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , @xmath12 ) , especially why is the mixing angle @xmath13 maximal ?",

    "why do generations exist ?",

    "one of the solutions is to introduce supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "however minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) does not satisfy the solution , because we must fine - tune @xmath14-parameter in superpotential of mssm , which is much smaller than planck scale in order to realize appropriate electroweak symmetry breaking . this is called @xmath14-problem .",
