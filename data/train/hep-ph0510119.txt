    "formulation of quantum field theory in terms of the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action has recently regained interest in the context of qcd .",
    "it leads for example to a good description of the entropy of the quark - gluon plasma from very high temperatures down to temperatures of the order of three times the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "the 2pi effective action was introduced in the context of the non - relativistic many body problem @xcite and was then extended to quantum field theory in @xcite .",
    "it aims at parametrising physical quantities in terms of one- and two - point functions . for quantities dominated by fluctuations encoded in one- and two - point functions , an expansion of the 2pi effective action",
    "is then expected to show better convergence properties than a perturbative ( 1pi ) expansion .",
    "this can be explicitly checked in equilibrium within scalar theories @xcite and there are evidences @xcite that the same phenomenon could cure the poor convergence of perturbative expansions @xcite for particular thermodynamic quantities in qcd .",
    "many other approaches aim at improving the convergence of perturbation theory using propagator resummation .",
    "this is for example the case of the so - called _ screened perturbation theory _ for scalar fields @xcite or its generalization to qcd @xcite .",
    "these other approaches are based on a resummation of the leading contribution to the self - energy for the soft modes ( hard thermal loops @xcite ) .",
    "however they also include these corrections at hard scales leading to spurious contributions , in particular artificial temperature dependent ultraviolet divergences .",
    "in contrast , the 2pi effective action treats soft and hard scales on a different footing thus preventing the presence of unwanted temperature dependent singularities .",
    "finally the use of the 2pi effective action goes now beyond the description of systems in equilibrium since it has been successfully applied to describe late time dynamics of quantum fields out - of - equilibrium @xcite and may then be useful in understanding equilibration properties of the system created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .    in order to do calculations within the 2pi framework",
    ", one has to devise approximations of the 2pi effective action . a particular class of approximations",
    "is obtained by considering diagrammatic truncations of the skeleton expansion @xcite for the 2pi effective action .",
    "these approximations , known as @xmath0-derivable @xcite , are important since they respect global symmetries @xcite and thus insure the presence of conserved quantities ( for instance , energy conservation is crucial in order to properly simulate the time evolution of quantum fields ) .",
    "there are however two major drawbacks when constructing @xmath0-derivable approximations .",
    "the first concerns any renormalizable theory and has to do with the possibility or not to remove uv divergences within a given @xmath0-derivable approximation .",
    "the second concerns gauge theories and how to preserve gauge invariance .",
    "the difficulties are related to the fact that a given truncation of the effective action only resums particular topologies and it is not clear how fundamental properties such as finiteness or gauge invariance manifest themselves within such a subclass of diagrams .",
    "recent progresses have been made concerning renormalization in the case of scalar theories @xcite .",
    "for such theories , divergent topologies can be self - consistently renormalized by means of zero temperature counterterms .",
    "the question remains however totally opened to know what can be said about renormalization in the case of gauge theories .",
    "two new features need to be understood : how to renormalize @xmath0-derivable approximations coupling different type of fields and the interplay between renormalization and symmetry .",
    "we choose here to address the simpler one : as a first step we consider a situation with the same power counting rules as qed but without the difficulties related to the gauge symmetry .",
    "the aim is to see if the divergent topologies can be again self - consistently renormalized in a situation with two kind of fields .",
    "we thus consider the case of a fermionic field coupled to a self - interacting scalar field via a yukawa interaction .",
    "we work in the context of equilibrium quantum field theory and discuss renormalization of the equations of motion in the symmetric phase .",
    "the broken phase will be dealt with in a subsequent work .",
    "section ii introduces the 2pi effective action together with the relevant equations involved in the renormalization process .",
    "the result is indeed an extension of what is done in @xcite .",
    "in particular , renormalization of singularities involving four scalar fields relies on the same bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the new feature is that , the kernel of the latter arises itself from a second bethe - salpeter equation for a four - point function involving only fermionic fields .",
    "this set of nested bethe - salpeter equations is the key to disentangle the coupling between scalar and fermionic degrees of freedom in the analysis of uv divergences . in section iii",
    ", we use this information to renormalize the equations of motion in the one - loop approximation .",
    "finally , section iv is devoted to the generalization to any loop order .",
    "we provide a systematic rule for renormalization .",
    "we conclude by saying a few words on the difficulties met when extending these results to abelian gauge theories .",
    "we consider a fermionic field @xmath1 coupled to a self - interacting scalar field @xmath2 ( @xmath3 theory ) via a yukawa interaction , in four dimensions .",
    "we consider for the moment the unrenormalized ( _ bare _ ) action which reads @xmath4 the time integral runs from @xmath5 to @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the inverse temperature .",
    "this theory is perturbatively renormalizable : the couplings in the action are dimensionless or , equivalently , the superficial degree of divergence @xmath8 of any feynman diagram does not depend on the number of vertices but only on the number of scalar ( @xmath9 ) and fermionic ( @xmath10 ) external legs : @xmath11 .",
    "the theory has to be regularized so that one can write meaningful expressions in auxiliary steps before renormalization . in this paper",

    "they have the advantage to be easier to implement numerically than a full self - consistent calculation .",
    "however the first approach is not systematic and the second is based on an expansion which leads to unbalanced temperature dependent singularities . in contrast the 2pi - loop expansion is systematic and as we will show can be renormalized without introducing artificial counterterms . before dealing with general 2pi - loop approximations in section [ sec : higher_loops ] , we illustrate the renormalization procedure at one - loop level for which the equations of motion read @xmath34 the notation @xmath35 includes finite temperature contributions via matsubara sums . the trace _ tr _ is taken over spin indices and we have taken into account the minus sign arising from the fermion loop .",

    "most of the ideas are those already described in @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : bobi2 ] ) .",
    "if the approximation belongs to the class of those described in section [ sec : higher_loops ] , the bph technique allows to renormalize @xmath86 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : bobi ] ) is then automatically finite since , in the bethe - salpeter _ ladders _ that it generates , one can not find subdiagrams with a non - negative superficial degree of divergence @xmath8 .",
    "it follows that @xmath52 is finite .",
    "this kernel @xmath52 , when combined with @xmath212 and @xmath50 in order to build @xmath92 , generates divergent structures , since the overall degree of divergence is @xmath44 .",

    "the leading logarithmic behaviour at large @xmath100 and fixed @xmath101 is related to the subgraphs that one can draw on @xmath92 which contain the external legs attached to @xmath100 and whose degree of divergence is @xmath44 . since the two legs attached to @xmath100 are scalar lines and since @xmath44 , the subgraph must have two other scalar external legs .",
    "the problem consists then in enumerating all the possible subgraphs with four scalar legs ( two of them being attached to @xmath100 ) that one can draw on @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath92 is 2pi with respect to scalar lines , the only possible subgraph is the diagram itself .",
    "the leading logarithmic behavior of this graph at large @xmath100 and fixed @xmath101 is obtained by considering the regime where the momenta of the lines of the graph go to infinity simultaneously .",
