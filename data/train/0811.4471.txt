    "<S> in order to see the effects of screening on gap generation , we also solved the gap equation when @xmath76 appears only in the interaction function @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative difference between the results in these two cases is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](b ) show that there is a competition between the suppressing effects of thermal fluctuation and disorder scattering . at low temperature @xmath64 , </S>",
    "<S> the scattering rate @xmath76 dominates ; while for small @xmath76 , the thermal effect dominates . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , a large @xmath76 suppresses the possibility of gap generation rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> further , we solved the gap equations eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : finitet_gap ] ) and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : finitet_v ] ) with the screening factor simply set to be @xmath92 and found that the results are quantitatively similar to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one might argue that the low - energy fermionic excitations are all suppressed once a fermion mass gap opens , so the dos vanishes at energy scale below the gap and there is no screening effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , for fermion of mass @xmath93 , the zero - energy dos was found @xcite to be @xmath94 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , we might include a gap @xmath93 into the polarization function @xmath95 and then study the gap equation . since the critical behavior of sm - in transition </S>",
    "<S> is studied by linearizing the nonlinear gap equation , the mass can be safely set to zero , @xmath96 , near the bifurcation point .    finally , we discuss effect of finite sample volume ( area in two dimensions ) . for a graphene plane of finite spatial extent , </S>",
    "<S> the particle momenta becomes discrete and the momenta transferred in the process of interaction can not be arbitrary small . </S>",
    "<S> if we still work in the continuum field theoretic formalism , this effect can be equivalently represented by imposing an infrared cutoff @xmath97 , given by the inverse sample size @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> its effects on @xmath4 is nearly the same as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](a ) at @xmath99 and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) at finite @xmath64 with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath97 , and hence are not shown explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> the results imply that the sample of large spatial extent is more favorable to undergo the sm - in transition @xcite .    besides the above four effects , any other mechanism that can screen the long - range coulomb interaction will also unavoidably lower the possibility of gap generation . </S>",
    "<S> if more than one screening effects coexist in reality , the suppression of sm - in transition becomes much more significant , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] . in light of these results , we conclude that the excitonic insulating state can most probably be observed in undoped , clean graphene of large area near absolutely zero temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> once the long - range coulomb interaction is screened , one interesting question is whether it can be equivalently replaced by a short - range or even a contact ( on - site ) repulsive interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this question can also be asked in another way : is the long - range nature or the strong coupling nature of coulomb interaction more important in driving the sm - in transition ? if the answer is the latter , then the long - range interaction can well be replaced by a short - range or contact one . according to the above results </S>",
    "<S> , it seems that the long - range , rather than strong coupling , nature plays the dominant role . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](a ) , even in the very strong coupling limit @xmath47 , the critical flavor @xmath4 is already less than the physical flavor @xmath8 when the screening factor @xmath100 . for moderately strong coupling @xmath101 , </S>",
    "<S> the excitonic insulating behavior becomes impossible even if the screening factor is only as small as @xmath102 .     </S>",
    "<S> on @xmath0 for different @xmath103.,width=211 ]    in order to test the role of contact interaction and see its difference from the screened coulomb interaction , we add one quartic interacting term to the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> there are several choices for the four - fermion coupling term , classified by the gamma matrices used to define the action @xcite . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we consider only one of them , i.e. , @xmath104 to the lowest order , this contact interaction contributes the following term @xmath105 to the gap equation , where the dimensionless coupling is @xmath106 and the scaling @xmath107 is made as before . </S>",
    "<S> the whole gap equation is solved with results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ] at @xmath108(@xmath109 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contact four - fermion interaction has opposite effect on the critical flavor @xmath4 as compared with the screening factor @xmath0 : while the latter rapidly suppresses @xmath4 , the former is very efficient in promoting the system towards the excitonic insulating phase ( note there is no goldstone boson in the insulating phase since the total hamiltonian preserves discrete chiral symmetry @xmath110 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we see that the contact four - fermion interaction is actually different from the screened coulomb interaction . for a relatively large screening factor @xmath0 , the latter is unable to generate excitonic gap even in the @xmath111 limit , while the former can generate such gap when its coupling is larger than some critical value @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this difference can be seen from the gap equation : for screened coulomb interaction , @xmath113 appearing in the denominator suppresses the contribution from large momenta , while @xmath0 in the denominator suppresses the contribution from small momenta ; on the contrary , for contact fermion interaction , the coupling @xmath103 is constant in the whole momenta region without any suppressing effect . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the sm - in transition is still possible if there is additional strong contact fermion interaction , even when the screened coulomb interaction itself can not open the gap .    </S>",
    "<S> we end with a brief discussion on the validity of the gap equation used in this paper . in a rigorous treatment , the excitonic gap generation </S>",
    "<S> should be studied by solving the self - consistent equations of fermion self - energy function , wave function renormalization , coulomb interaction , and vertex function . in practice , a number of approximations must be utilized . </S>",
    "<S> here we kept only the fock diagram for the fermion self - energy and omit all higher order corrections of the @xmath18 expansion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results should be qualitatively reliable for large @xmath17 . to verify the conclusions obtained in the leading order </S>",
    "<S> , it would be necessary to include these corrections ( such as wave function renormalization , vertex function correction , _ etc . </S>",
    "<S> _ ) since they might change the quantities of critical parameters @xmath3 and @xmath1 considerably for the physical flavor @xmath114 . however , this is beyond the scope of the present work . </S>",
    "<S> another question concerns the important effect of velocity renormalization on the excitonic gap instability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been addressed recently by incorporating the momentum - dependent fermion velocity into the gap equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the velocity renormalization does not dramatically affect the excitonic instability @xcite .    </S>",
