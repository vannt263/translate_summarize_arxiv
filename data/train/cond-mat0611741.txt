    "recently there has been an increasing interest in the studies of far - from - equilibrium systems typical in our natural and social environment .",
    "concepts originated from the physics of phase transitions in equilibrium systems @xcite such as collective behavior , scale invariance and renormalization have been shown to be useful in the understanding of various non - equilibrium systems as well .",
    "simple algorithmic models have been helpful in the extraction of the basic properties of various far - from - equilibrium phenomena , like diffusion limited growth @xcite , self - organized criticality@xcite or surface roughening @xcite .",
    "motion and related transport phenomena represent a further characteristic aspect of non - equilibrium processes . indeed , the transport in various driven systems , such as traffic models@xcite , molecular motors@xcite and other self - propelled systems @xcite have been the subject of recent studies .",
    "self - propulsion is an essential feature of most living systems .",
    "moreover , the motion of the organisms is usually controlled not only by some external fields , but also by interactions with other organisms in their neighborhood . in ref.@xcite , a simple model was introduced capturing these features with a view toward modeling the collective motion of large groups of organisms @xcite such as schools of fish , herds of quadrupeds , flocks of birds , or groups of migrating bacteria@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to further investigate the various interesting phenomena exhibited by this novel non - equilibrium model .",
    "the model consists of particles moving on a plane and characterized by their ( off - lattice ) location @xmath7 and velocity @xmath8 pointing in the direction @xmath9 , where the function @xmath10 gives the angle between its argument vector and a selected direction ( e.g. , horizontal coordinate axis ) .",
    "the magnitude of the velocity is fixed to @xmath11 to account for the _ self - propelled _ nature of the particles .",
    "a simple local interaction is defined in the model : at each time step a given particle assumes the average direction of motion of the particles in its local neighborhood @xmath12 with some uncertainty , as described by @xmath13 where the noise @xmath14 is a random variable with a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath15 $ ] and the local average direction of motion @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 the local surrounding of the @xmath18th particle @xmath12 will be specified in sec .",
    "the locations of the particles are updated in each time step as @xmath19    this model is a transport related , non - equilibrium analog of the _ ferromagnetic _ models , with the important difference that it is inherently _ dynamic _ : the elementary event is the motion of a particle at each time step and a change in the direction of motion .",
    "the analogy is as follows : the hamiltonian tending to align the spins in the same direction in the case of equilibrium ferromagnets is replaced by the rule of aligning the direction of motion of particles .",
    "the amplitude of the random perturbations is in analogy with the temperature @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath20 , the model is similar to the monte - carlo simulations of diluted @xmath21 ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "the reported long - range order in the above@xcite and the closely related models@xcite is surprising , because in the case of equilibrium systems possessing continuous rotational symmetry the ordered phase is destroyed at finite temperatures@xcite .",
    "a recent dynamic renormalization group treatment of the problem@xcite by tu and toner has also led to the conclusion of the existence of an ordered phase in two dimensions .",
    "thus , the question of how the ordered phase emerges due to the non - equilibrium nature of the model is of considerable theoretical interest as well . in section",
    "ii we study the kinetic phase transition leading to the symmetry - broken state , which is characterized in section iii . in section iv .",
    "we investigate the effect of an external field applied to the system .",
    "we studied the behavior of the model defined through eqs .",
    "( [ eom])-([update ] ) by performing large - scale monte - carlo simulations as a function of two control parameters : the density of particles @xmath2 and amplitude of the noise @xmath1 .",
    "we applied random initial conditions and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the calculations were performed on a _ connection machine 5 _ parallel computer , with typically @xmath22 particles .",
    "the interaction range of @xmath12 was defined in two different ways : ( i ) as a circle of radius @xmath23 , or ( ii ) by considering a square lattice on the plane built up from lattice cells of length @xmath23 , and assuming that a given particle interacts with all the particles located in the same lattice cell and in the eight neighboring cells ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the existence of the long - range order , and the critical exponents , turned out to be _ robust _ against changing these details [ ( i ) or ( ii ) ] of the interaction . here",
    "we present results obtained by definition ( ii ) , as this latter choice of @xmath12 increases the speed of the simulations by a considerable amount .",
    "a natural dimensionless parameter is @xmath24 , and the behavior of the model on @xmath11 , @xmath25 and @xmath23 depends only through their combination given in this expression for @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we can work with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the results presented in the following were obtained with @xmath29 , the role of this velocity is discussed in sec .",
    "v.    for the statistical characterization of the model , a well - suited order parameter is the magnitude of the average momentum of the system : @xmath30 this measure of the net flow is non - zero in the ordered phase , and vanishes ( for an infinite system ) in the disordered phase .",
    "we start the simulations from a disordered system ( random positions and orientations ) , thus @xmath31 . after some relaxation time a steady state",
    "emerges indicated , e.g. , by the convergence of the cumulative average @xmath32 . here",
    "we focus on the statistical properties of the steady state only , and do not deal with the entire relaxation process . in the vicinity of the critical regime to reach the stationary behavior takes more than @xmath33 monte - carlo steps for a typical simulation with @xmath34 particles in a @xmath35 system . in such cases we run the simulations for @xmath36 time steps , which takes about @xmath37 hours cpu time on the @xmath38 .",
    "the stationary values of @xmath0 that we obtained as a time average are plotted in fig .",
    "2a vs @xmath1 for @xmath39 and various system sizes . in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , for weak noise the model displays long - range ordered motion ( up to the actual system size @xmath40 ) , that disappears in a continuous manner by increasing @xmath1 .    as @xmath41 ,",
    "the numerical results indicate the presence of a kinetic phase transition described by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the critical noise amplitude that separates the ordered and disordered phases . for a given set of @xmath44 ,",
    "the exponent @xmath45 and @xmath43 is determined by selecting the values providing the best fit to the _ ansatz _ ( [ scale ] ) , i.e. , yielding the maximal scaling regime .",
    "the numerical results are consistent with ( [ scale ] ) , since the scaling regime is increased for larger @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "2b ) and the estimated values of @xmath43 converge to a non - zero @xmath47 value as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is approximately equal to @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "this calculation yields ( for @xmath39 ) @xmath51 , which is definitely different from the the mean - field value @xmath52 , and consistent with the value reported in @xcite obtained for smaller systems using definition ( i ) for @xmath12 .",
    "next we discuss the role of density . in fig .",
    "3a , @xmath44 is plotted for @xmath53 and various values of @xmath2 .",
    "one can observe that the long - range ordered phase is present for any @xmath2 , but for a fixed value of @xmath1 , @xmath0 vanishes with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "these @xmath44 functions parameterized by various @xmath2 collapse to a `` universal '' function @xmath54 by rescaling @xmath1 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and @xmath55 is determined as the value which minimizes @xmath61 ^ 2.\\ ] ] here the @xmath62 cutoff is chosen to exclude the noisy and rounded ( due to finite - size effects ) region around @xmath63 . in our calculations",
    "we used the value @xmath64 , and we determined @xmath54 in a self - consistent manner by averaging over the already rescaled @xmath65 functions .",
    "we show the result of the data collapse in fig .",
    "this procedure ( together with the finite - size analysis for a given @xmath2 ) also yields the position of the `` critical line '' @xmath55 in the @xmath66 parameter space . according to our numerical results",
    ", @xmath67 holds with @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "3c ) . apart from the numerical uncertainties , @xmath69 , in agreement with recent theoretical results @xcite .",
    "the critical line ( [ kappa ] ) is qualitatively different from that of the diluted ferromagnets , since here the critical density at @xmath70 ( corresponding to the percolation threshold for diluted ferromagnets , see , e.g. , @xcite ) is vanishing , @xmath71 to see this , let us imagine a system of size @xmath40 consisting of two particles only .",
    "due to the finite size of @xmath12 , for almost all initial conditions the trajectories of these particles will get close enough to each other to establish interaction .",
    "as the noise is negligible in ( [ eom ] ) , the cluster formed by the particles will not break apart , resulting in @xmath72 for any finite @xmath2 as @xmath73 .",
    "the behavior of the model in the @xmath74 limit is still not clear . by definition",
    "@xmath75 holds , so ( [ kappa ] ) obviously can not describe the system in this limit . thus @xmath55 either approaches @xmath76 or a non - trivial @xmath77 value .",
    "finally we note that eq.([v ] ) also implies that the exponent @xmath78 , defined as @xmath79 for @xmath80 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , must be equal to @xmath45 , since @xmath81}\\right)\\approx \\tilde{\\phi}\\left(1-{1\\over\\eta}{\\partial\\eta_c\\over\\partial\\varrho } \\epsilon\\right)\\sim\\epsilon^\\beta,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 denotes the inverse function of @xmath82 as @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "indeed , the results of the simulations performed with @xmath84 and various @xmath40 and @xmath85 yield @xmath86 , which is consistent with @xmath87 . in this case",
    "the larger uncertainty is due to the increased noise at low densities .",
    "as a further analogy with equilibrium phase transitions , we note that the fluctuations of the order parameter also increase on approaching the critical line . to study this ,",
    "we calculate for various control parameters the standard deviation of the total momentum , defined as @xmath88 , where the averages are taken over the stationary data set obtained from the simulations . in fig .",
    "4a we plot @xmath89 vs the rescaled noise amplitude @xmath90 for various densities and @xmath53 .",
    "the tails of the curves are symmetric , and decay as power - laws with an exponent @xmath91 close to @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "4b ) @xmath93 in sec .",
    "iv we compare this result to direct susceptibility measurements , when an external field is also applied .",
    "we studied the time correlations of the fluctuations by calculating the expected value of the rms deviation in a time interval @xmath25 @xmath94 where the internal and external brackets denote averages calculated over a time interval @xmath95 $ ] and the entire stationary data set , respectively . a close relation between @xmath96 and the power - spectrum @xmath97 of the order parameter @xmath98 can be derived from the self - affine properties of the signal@xcite : @xmath99 is equivalent to @xmath100 , and for the exponents @xmath101 holds ( for @xmath102 ) .    the numerically obtained results ( fig .",
    "5a ) show that at the critical line the fluctuations of the order parameter are characterized by the correlation exponent @xmath103 up to a characteristic correlation time @xmath104 .",
    "this behavior means that in the steady state the ` condensation ' and ` evaporation ' processes ( when particles join or leave the dominant cluster , respectively ) are correlated @xcite . for @xmath105",
    "the the system shows even stronger correlations , as in this regime @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "this behavior is probably related to the periodic boundary conditions , as @xmath104 is comparable to @xmath107 , the time needed for a particle to cross the entire system .",
    "the presence of the long - range correlated phase in two dimensions ( i.e. the breakdown of the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite ) is a striking consequence of the non - equilibrium nature of the @xmath21 model .",
    "as the fluctuation - response theorem @xmath108 must hold for hamiltonian systems only , it is interesting to check its applicability when the equation of motion can not be derived from a hamiltonian .    a natural way to introduce an external field in the model",
    "is by changing rule ( [ avg ] ) for @xmath109 where @xmath110 is an arbitrary unit vector and the parameter @xmath4 controls the strength of the perturbation .    in the numerical studies we set the density of the particles to @xmath111 , and study @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "typical results for systems of @xmath53 are plotted in fig .",
    "the curves parameterized by various @xmath1 intersect the @xmath112 axis at the same values found in sec .",
    "ii , so for @xmath112 the original model is recovered . in general",
    ", @xmath0 is increased for increasing @xmath4 , and the results can be summarized by means of critical exponents @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and susceptibility @xmath116 defined in a manner similar to the case of classical magnets : @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 we distinguish the critical exponents @xmath114 and @xmath115 from the exponent @xmath91 defined by the singularity of @xmath120 , since in this case @xmath121 ( as will be demonstrated later ) .    to determine @xmath113 , we plot the obtained @xmath44 curves on a double logarithmic plot ( see fig",
    "we see that for large values of @xmath0 the system saturates ( @xmath122 ) , while for low values of @xmath0 the finite - size noise dominates ( @xmath123 , for @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus , we expect that the relation @xmath124 holds for @xmath125 $ ] only . as the boundaries of this interval do not depend on @xmath1 until @xmath126 , eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) can be verified by collapsing the rescaled @xmath127 data points onto a single power - law ( fig .",
    "similarly to the determination of @xmath55 , @xmath116 and @xmath113 can be calculated in a self - consistent manner .",
    "this procedure yields @xmath128 and @xmath116 decaying with @xmath129 .",
    "note , that @xmath115 can not be obtained by this method as in the ordered phase @xmath130 .    to check the stability of these results",
    ", we also performed measurements on larger systems , where @xmath131 is reduced .",
    "indeed , the scaling regime for ( [ delta ] ) increases and the exponent is consistent with our former estimate ( see fig .",
    "7c )    we can also calculate @xmath116 applying its definition ( [ def ] ) by sampling a series of @xmath132 /(h_i - h_i')$ ] for various @xmath133 , and ( as @xmath134 ) assuming @xmath135 .",
    "the result is shown on fig .",
    "the @xmath126 tail is consistent with our former estimate from applying ( [ delta ] ) , while for @xmath136 @xmath116 decays with @xmath137 .",
    "we have demonstrated that this far - from - equilibrium system of self - propelled particles can be described using the framework of classical critical phenomena , but shows surprising new features when compared to the analogous equilibrium systems .",
    "the velocity @xmath11 provides a control parameter which switches between an equilibrium @xmath21 type model ( @xmath138 ) , and another universality class of dynamic , non - equilibrium models characterized by a non - vanishing value of @xmath11 .    indeed ,",
