    "the interaction of two oppositely propagating alfvnic wave packets has been studied for more than half a century .",
    "this interaction has been proposed as an elementary step in the analysis of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) turbulence @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the framework of ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , large amplitude perturbations in which the magnetic @xmath0 and bulk velocity @xmath1 fluctuations are either perfectly correlated , or perfectly anti - correlated , are solutions of the governing equations . to induce nonlinear couplings among the fluctuations , and therefore to excite turbulence ,",
    "it is necessary to simultaneously consider magnetic fluctuations @xmath0 and velocity fluctuations @xmath1 that have an arbitrary sense of correlation .",
    "this may be accomplished by superposing the two senses of correlation , in alfvn units , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    based on these considerations",
    ", @xcite and @xcite analyzed the collision of large - amplitude alfvn wave packets in the framework of the incompressible mhd , observing that their interaction is limited to the time interval in which they overlap . during this temporal window wave packets",
    "can transfer energy and modify their spatial structure ; however , after the collision , packets return to undisturbed propagation without further interactions .",
    "the parker ",
    "moffatt problem has been recently revisited in @xcite ( hereafter , paper i ) with the motivation to extend its description to the realm of the kinetic plasmas .",
    "in fact , the scenario described by parker & moffatt is potentially applicable to astrophysical plasmas such as solar wind @xcite or solar corona @xcite , where alfvnic perturbations represent one of the main components of fluctuations .",
    "however , since such systems often exhibit compressive activity as well as dispersion and kinetic signatures @xcite , it is of considerable interest to include these features in the analysis of the _ parker _ & _ moffatt _ problem .",
    "in particular , in paper i , it has been found that during the wave packets interaction , as prescribed by _ parker _ & _ moffatt _ , nonlinear coupling processes cause the magnetic energy spectra to evolve towards isotropy , while energy transfers towards smaller spatial scales .",
    "moreover , the new ingredients introduced with the kinetic simulation ( hall and kinetic effects ) play a significant role and several features of the evolution in the vlasov case differ with respect to the mhd evolution . here",
    "we extend that study to discern the role of dispersive and genuinely kinetic effects , supplementing the previously considered mhd and vlasov simulations , by introducing also an hall mhd simulation .",
    "moreover , we also examine this basic problem by means of a hybrid particle - in - cell simulation ( hpic ) , which allows comparison of two different numerical approaches ( hvm and hpic ) , which refer to the same physical model .",
    "we may anticipate that , in the hpic case , the system dynamics at small scales is affected by the presence of particles thermal noise and only the features related to large spatial scales are properly recovered during the evolution of the two wave packets .",
    "based on this consideration , we employ mainly the hvm simulation to highlight the presence of kinetic effects during the wave packets interaction .",
    "in particular , during the collision of the wave packets , the proton velocity distribution function ( vdf ) exhibits a beam along the background magnetic field direction , similar to some solar wind observations @xcite .",
    "we note that the present paper compares results from four different models in the context of a single physical problem , and is therefore also a contribution in the spirit of the `` turbulence dissipation challenge '' that has been recently discussed in the space plasma community @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec : kin ] , examines kinetic signatures in the hvm simulation .",
    "finally we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] by summarizing our results .",
    "as discussed above , here we approach the problem concerning the interaction of two alfvnic wave packets by means of fluid and hybrid numerical simulations . for problems such as this ,",
    "the system dimensionality is fundamental : in fact , a proper description should consider a three - dimensional physical space ( i.e. three - dimensional wave vectors ) , where both parallel and perpendicular cascades are taken into account @xcite .",
    "however , dynamical range of the spatial scales ( wave numbers ) represented in the model is equally important to capture nonlinear couplings during the wave packet interaction .",
    "furthermore , performing a kinetic hvm simulation which contemporaneously includes a full @xmath4@xmath5 phase space and while also retaining a good spatial resolution is too demanding for the present high performance computing capability .",
    "given that numerous runs are required to complete a study such as the present one , a fully 3d approach would be prohibitive .",
    "therefore we adopt a @xmath6 physical space , where vectorial fields are three - dimensional but their variations depend only on two spatial coordinates ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",

    "this means that the compressible effects , introduced here by the fact that initial perturbations are not pressured balanced , are not strong enough to break the @xmath91 invariance . on the other hand , for the remaining simulations ( hmhd , hvm and hpic )",

    "it seems also significant to point out that , the initial growth of @xmath91 occurs faster in the kinetic cases compared to the hmhd one .",
    "this may reflect the fact that , the initial condition evolves differently in the hall mhd simulation compared to the kinetic runs .    in order to understand the role of the hall physics , we computed the normalized generalized cross helicity @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , which is an invariant of incompressible hmhd @xcite .",

    "note that the evolution of @xmath108 is trivial for the mhd simulation where , since @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , it can be easily appreciated that , for the hmhd case , @xmath108 is almost preserved and does not exhibit any significant variation due to the collision itself , even though it shows a slight increase in the initial stages of the simulation followed by a decay towards @xmath111 [ similar to the growth of @xmath91 recovered in fig .",
    "[ fig : hchg](b ) ] . on the other hand",
    "the two kinetic cases , which exhibit a similar behavior , show a fast growth of @xmath108 in the initial stage of the simulations followed by a decay phase [ similar to the growth of @xmath91 recovered in fig .",
    "[ fig : hchg](b ) ] ; then , during the collision , @xmath108 significantly increases .",
    "we may explain the evolution of @xmath91 and @xmath108 as follows .",
    "in the mhd run , compressive effects contained in the initial condition as well as compressible activity generated during the evolution are not strong enough to break the invariance of @xmath91 ( i.e. of @xmath108 ) . instead , in the hall mhd",
    "simulation , the first break of the @xmath91 invariance observed in the initial stage of the simulation can not be associated with the hall effect since also @xmath108 is not preserved in this temporal region and @xmath91 and @xmath108 have a similar evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the jump recovered in @xmath91 around @xmath112 is significantly related to the hall physics .",
    "in fact , since @xmath108 does not exhibit a similar jump at @xmath113 , we argue that the physics which produces the growth of @xmath91 is the hall physics ( which is taken into account in the invariance of @xmath108 ) .",
    "finally , the production of both @xmath91 and @xmath108 recovered in the kinetic simulations can not be completely associated with the hall effect ( which , of course , is still present ) but kinetic and compressive effects may have an important role .    in order to explore the role of small scales into the dynamics of colliding wave packets , we computed the averaged mean squared current density @xmath114 as a function of time .",
    "this quantity indicates the presence of small scale activity ( such as production of small scale current sheets ) , and is reported in figure [ fig : mjz2 ] for all the simulations . as in the previous figures , black , blue dashed , green dashed and red lines refer to the mhd , hmhd , hvm and hpic cases , respectively .",
    "all models show a peak of @xmath115 around the collision time @xmath116 due to the collision of wave packets .",
    "after the collision , some high - intensity current activity persists in all the simulations , which present a qualitatively similar evolution of @xmath115 .",
    "other quantities that provide physical details about our simulations are @xmath117 ( compressibility ) and the enstrophy @xmath118 ( fluid vorticity @xmath119 ) .",
    "note that @xmath120 .",
    "figure [ fig : enst ] reports the temporal evolution of @xmath121 ( a ) and @xmath122 ( b ) for all the runs .",
    "black , blue dashed , green dashed and red lines indicate respectively the mhd , hmhd , hvm and hpic cases .",
    "the @xmath121 evolution shows that density fluctuations peak around @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the two peaks are respectively associated with the collision between the packets and with the propagation of magneto - sonic fluctuations generated by the initial strong collision with provide a sort of `` echo '' of the original interaction . moreover , from the initial stage of the simulations , @xmath121 exhibits some modulations , which are produced by the absence of a pressure balance in the initial condition .",
    "in fact , as packets start to evolve , low - amplitude fast perturbations ( clearly visible in the density contour plots , not shown here ) propagate across the box and collide faster compared to the `` main '' wave packets themselves .",
    "moreover , by comparing the different simulations , one notices that , for @xmath125 , kinetic and hall runs tend to produce a similar evolution of @xmath121 , slightly bigger compared to the mhd case .",
    "then , around @xmath126 , the hmhd run displays a stronger compressibility with respect to the kinetic cases .",
    "this difference is probably due to the presence of kinetic damping phenomena which occur in the kinetic cases .    =    the enstrophy @xmath122 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : enst](b ) .",
    "all the runs exhibit a similar evolution of @xmath122 up to the wave packet collisions .",
    "then mhd and hmhd cases exhibit a quite similar level of @xmath122 , slightly bigger compared to the one recovered in the hvm and hpic cases , where probably kinetic damping does not allow the formation of strong vortical structures at small scales .",
    "it is interesting to compare different simulations also by looking at power spectral densities ( psds ) .",
    "figures [ fig : spectra ] show the magnetic energy psd integrated along @xmath127 @xmath128 ( left column ) and along @xmath129 @xmath130 ( right column ) ; while each row respectively refers to @xmath131 ( top row ) , @xmath84 ( center row ) and @xmath86 ( bottom row ) .",

    "it is interesting to note that , at @xmath83 , all the simulations exhibit a steep spectrum in @xmath135 , related to the initial condition , while the difference in power between @xmath135 and @xmath136 - the latter being significantly smaller than the former - tends to reduce in the final stages of the simulations .",
    "this suggest , as described in paper i , the presence of nonlinear couplings which cause spectra to become more isotropic .",
    "moreover the comparison between the different simulations indicates that the dynamics at large scales is described in a quite similar way by all runs , while at small scales some differences are revealed . in particular , the hpic simulation is affected by particles noise while the hvm run contains more energy at small scales compared to mhd and hmhd . note that the presence , in mhd and hmhd runs , of an explicit resistivity prevents the population of small scales .    to summarize this section , we compared our numerical codes by analyzing some global diagnostics and we conclude that the moffatt - parker scenario is quite well satisfied by mhd .",
    "however , other intriguing characteristics are observed when one moves beyond the mhd treatment .",
    "moreover , the comparison between kinetic codes suggests that hvm and hpic simulations display qualitatively similar features at large scales .",

    "magnetic energy spectra differ in the hpic case compared with the hvm case .",
    "moreover , by comparing the @xmath137 contour plots , one can easily appreciate how hpic simulation is affected by particle noise .",
    "based on these considerations , we continue the analysis of the kinetic features produced in alfvn wave packet collisions by focusing only on the hvm case .",
    "we begin a description of the kinetic signatures present in the vlasov simulation by looking at the temperature anisotropy . fig .",

    "hence , their dynamical evolution leads to an anisotropy production .",
    "moreover , a more careful analysis suggests that the left wave packet tends to produce regions where @xmath139 close to the packet itself ( which , as it can be appreciated in fig .",

    "it is interesting to point out that , beyond the presence of temperature anisotropies , regions characterized by a temperature nongyrotropy are also recovered .",
    "many methods have been proposed by evaluating the temperature nongyrotropy @xcite .",

    "the drift speed of the beam is about @xmath157 .",
    "the production of a beam due to the interaction of two wave packets has been also pointed out by @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have described the interaction of two alfvnic wave packets by means of mhd , hall mhd and hybrid kinetic simulations of the same physical configuration .",
    "kinetic simulations have been performed with two different codes : an eulerian vlasov - maxwell code @xcite and hybrid particle - in - cell code @xcite . by approaching the _ parker _ & _ moffatt _ problem within several physical frameworks , we have comparatively analyzed different effects ( compressive , hall and kinetic ) which contribute to the general , complex puzzle .    the analysis performed in paper i where mhd and vlasov simulations were compared has been here extended by including the hall mhd framework .",
    "in particular , we showed how , moving beyond the pure mhd treatment , dispersion as well as kinetic effects play an important role .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of hmhd and kinetic runs allows to separate the presence of dispersive and purely kinetic features .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the compressive activity is different in the hall case compared to the kinetic runs , indicating that some kinetic damping processes may be active in the vlasov simulation .",
    "a separate type of comparison is afforded by comparative analysis of the hpic and hvm runs , while these methods should describe , approximately , the same physics , i.e. , the vlasov treatment of collsionless plasma dynamics , the comparison between the different codes is interesting from a methodological perspective , and therefore represents a contribution to the turbulent dissipation challenge @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the two kinetic simulations performed are able to take into account the dynamics which occurs at large spatial scales and their comparison is successful in this range of scales .",
    "however the pic runs lacks accuracy when smaller spatial scales are produced by the collision of the two wave packets , thus indicating that the eulerian approach better describes the dynamics of the system at small spatial scales .",
    "of course the comparison is expected to become better if the number of particle per cell in the pic simulation gets bigger @xcite .",
    "based on the last consideration , we have analyzed the production of kinetic signatures by focusing only on the hvm simulation .",
    "several proxies which are routinely adopted for highlighting the presence of kinetic features indicate that wave packets tend to produce kinetic effects such as temperature anisotropies and nongyrotropies also before the main wave packets interaction .",
    "this is related to the fact that the initial condition , consisting of quasi - alfvnic wave packets , is neither a vlasov equilibrium nor a vlasov eigenmode .",
    "therefore it dynamically leads to the production of kinetic features .    the analysis of kinetic effects before and after the main wave packets collision indicates that some kinetic features are enhanced by the collision itself and each wave packet is significantly characterized by a strong degree of non - thermal signatures .",
    "in particular the presence of temperature nongyrotropies suggests that descriptions based on reduced velocity space assumptions may partially fail the description of such features . finally , similarly to the observations of @xcite , during the wave packet collision ,",
    "a beam in the velocity distribution function is observed to form along the direction of the local magnetic field .",
    "this characteristic may connect our results with the general scenario of wave packets observed in natural plasmas such as the solar wind .",
