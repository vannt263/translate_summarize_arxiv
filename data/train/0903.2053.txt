    "in this note we are concerned with estimates for non - positive eigenvalues of one - dimensional schrdinger operators with complex - valued potentials .",
    "we shall provide an example of a bound where the sharp constant _ worsens _ when a dirichlet boundary condition is imposed .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of real - valued potentials , where the variational principle implies that the absolute value of the non - positive eigenvalues decreases .    in order to describe our result",
    ", we first assume that @xmath0 is real - valued .",
    "it is a well - known fact ( attributed to l. spruch in @xcite ) that any negative eigenvalue @xmath1 of the schrdinger operator @xmath2 in @xmath3 satisfies @xmath4 in this inequality is sharp and attained if @xmath5 for any @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "( it follows from the sobolev embedding theorem that the operator @xmath2 can be defined in the quadratic form sense as long as @xmath0 is a finite borel measure on @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the right side of denotes the total variation of the measure . ) from and the variational principle for self - adjoint operators we immediately infer that any negative eigenvalue of the operator @xmath2 in @xmath9 with dirichlet boundary conditions satisfies @xmath10 in this inequality is still sharp but no longer attained .    motivated by concrete physical examples and problems in computational mathematics , an increasing interest in eigenvalue estimates for _ complex - valued _ potentials",
    "has developed in recent years .",
    "a beautiful observation of @xcite is that remains valid for all eigenvalues in @xmath11 even if @xmath0 is complex - valued .",
    "the same is not true for ! indeed , our main result is    [ main ] for @xmath12 let @xmath13 any eigenvalue @xmath14 of the operator @xmath2 in @xmath9 with dirichlet boundary conditions satisfies @xmath15 and @xmath16 there are @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that for @xmath19 one has @xmath20 and the unique eigenvalue of @xmath2 is given by @xmath21 , that is , equality is attained in .",
    "our bound does not apply to positive eigenvalues . in the case of real - valued potential",
    "it is known that there are no positive eigenvalues if @xmath22 .",
    "we note that @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "the following lemma discusses the function @xmath25 in more detail .",
    "[ g ] for @xmath26 , the function @xmath27 is monotone increasing , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 for small @xmath31 , and @xmath32 as @xmath33 .    in figure  [ fig.1 ]",
    "we plot the curve @xmath34 .",
    "it follows from that this curve hits the positive real axis at the point @xmath35 with slope @xmath36 .",
    "close to the point @xmath37 the curve coincides with a semi - circle up to exponentially small terms , as shows .     on the half - line with @xmath38 .",
    "the dashed line is the corresponding bound on the whole line.,width=340,height=170 ]    using that @xmath39 we find    any eigenvalue @xmath40 of the operator @xmath2 in @xmath9 with dirichlet boundary conditions satisfies @xmath41 .",
    "inequality follows also from inequality for complex - valued potentials .",
    "indeed , the odd extension of an eigenfunction of the dirichlet operator is an eigenfunction of the whole - line operator with the potential @xmath42 with the same eigenvalue .",
    "the remarkable fact is that the inequality is sharp in the complex - valued case , as shown in theorem [ main ] .    by the same argument",
    "is also valid if _",
    "neumann _ instead of dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed . in this case equality",
    "holds for any @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , in the neumann case ( [ eq : maincor ] ) is sharp for any fixed argument @xmath45 of the eigenvalue @xmath1 .",
    "the analogue for mixed boundary conditions is    [ prop1 ] let @xmath46 .",
    "any eigenvalue @xmath40 of the operator @xmath2 in @xmath9 with boundary conditions @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 and any fixed argument @xmath45 of the eigenvalue @xmath1 .",
    "note that if @xmath49 a bound of the form ( [ eq : maincor2 ] ) can not hold since there exists a non - positive eigenvalue even in the case @xmath50 .    in the _ self - adjoint _ case inequality for whole - line operators",
    "is accompanied by bounds @xmath51 ; see @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the _ non - selfadjoint _ case it seems to be unknown whether the condition @xmath52 for some @xmath53 implies that all eigenvalues in @xmath54 lie inside a finite disc ; see @xcite for partial results in this direction .",
    "we would like to remark here that even if a bound of the form were true in the non - selfadjoint case with @xmath53 , then ( in contrast to for @xmath55 ) the constant would have to be strictly larger than in the self - adjoint case . to see this , consider @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "then @xmath58 is an eigenvalue ( with eigenfunction @xmath59 ) and the supremum @xmath60 is clearly attained for purely imaginary values of @xmath61 .",
    "assume that @xmath62 with @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "then the birman - schwinger operator @xmath66 has an eigenvalue @xmath67 , and hence its operator norm is greater or equal to 1 .",
    "the integral kernel of this operator equals @xmath68 and hence @xmath69 without loss of generality , we can take the supremum over the smaller set @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath71 since @xmath72 , the supremum over @xmath73 is achieved at @xmath74 , and hence @xmath75 if we write @xmath76 with @xmath45 , then @xmath77 with @xmath25 from .",
    "hence we have shown that @xmath78 since the left side is greater or equal to 1 , as remarked above , we obtain .",
    "for @xmath5 the birman - schwinger operator reduces to the number @xmath79 and inequality ( [ ineq ] ) becomes equality provided @xmath80 satisfies @xmath81 . for",
    "given @xmath82 and @xmath83 this determines @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the phase of @xmath86 is found from the equation @xmath87 .    by continuity for @xmath24",
    "there exists an optimizer @xmath88 such that @xmath89 .",
    "we claim that @xmath88 satisfies @xmath90 . to see the lower bound , note that @xmath91 if and only if @xmath92 .",
    "in particular , @xmath93 . for the upper bound , if @xmath94 and @xmath95 , replacing @xmath96 by @xmath97 leads to a contradiction .",
    "similarly , if @xmath98 it can replaced by @xmath99 in order exclude that @xmath100 is the optimizer .      plugging in @xmath104",
    ", we obtain @xmath105 . for large enough @xmath31",
    ", it follows from this that @xmath88 is close to @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , @xmath107 , and hence @xmath108 .",
    "this implies that @xmath109 , and thus @xmath110 , as claimed .",
    "we proceed as in the proof of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "the birman - schwinger operator has the kernel @xmath113 the assertion follows as above using that @xmath114 by the triangle inequality and the fact that @xmath115 .",
    "the fact that the bound ( [ eq : maincor2 ] ) is sharp for given argument @xmath45 of the eigenvalue @xmath1 follows by choosing @xmath116 for @xmath6 and letting @xmath117 .",
