    "high harmonic generation ( hhg ) represents a versatile and highly successful avenue towards an ultrashort coherent light source covering a wavelength range from the vacuum ultraviolet to the soft x - ray region @xcite .",

    "the fundamental wavelength @xmath0 used in most hhg experiments to date is in the near - visible range ( @xmath1 nm ) .",
    "the cutoff law for the harmonic spectrum @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the binding energy of the target atom and @xmath4 the ponderomotive energy ( @xmath5 : laser electric field strength ) , suggests that a longer fundamental wavelength would be advantageous to extend the cutoff to higher photon energies , since @xmath6 increases quadratically with @xmath0 .",
    "this has stimulated an increasing interest in the development of high - power mid - infrared ( @xmath7 m ) laser systems , e.g. , based on optical parametric chirped pulse amplification .",
    "the first generation of water - window harmonics with clear plateau and cut - off structures has recently been reported @xcite . along those lines",
    "the dependence of the hhg yield on @xmath0 has become an issue of major interest @xcite .",
    "it had long been believed that the spreading of the returning wavepacket would result in a @xmath8 dependence of the hhg efficiency @xcite as long as ground state depletion can be neglected @xcite ; experimental findings @xcite provided partial support .",

    "@xcite have reported a different wavelength - scaling of hhg between 800 nm and 2 @xmath9 m calculated with the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for ar and a strong - field approximation ( sfa ) for he .",
    "they found the yield to be described by a power - law @xmath10 with @xmath11 . investigating the @xmath0 dependence on the level of single - atom response for h and ar by numerically solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation we could confirm the overall scaling with an inverse power law exceeding five @xcite ,",
    "the harmonic yield was found not to depend smoothly on the fundamental wavelength , but to exhibit surprisingly rapid oscillations with a period of @xmath12 nm depending on the wavelength region .",
    "a semiclassical analysis based on the sfa has revealed that the rapid oscillations are due to the interference of five to ten different rescattering trajectories @xcite .",
    "moreover , we found the oscillations to be stable with respect to variations of the pulse envelope as long as the effective pulse length and thus the number of relevant trajectories remains equal , while the amplitude of the oscillations decreases with decreasing pulse length @xcite .",
    "these observations underscored the view that the oscillations are due to the interference of quantum paths .",

    "_ @xcite and miloevi and becker @xcite have shown that hhg is enhanced at channel closings ( cc ) , i.e. , when @xmath14 is an integer .",

    "we compare the results of the full 3d tdse solution with the strong - field approximation and a truncated coulomb - potential model in order to delineate underlying mechanisms .",
    "we find that the correspondence of the modulation period to @xmath18 holds for a wide wavelength range between 800 nm and @xmath21 m , and that the peak positions in terms of @xmath16 are almost independent of laser intensity .",

    "we stress that these remarkable observations hold true only when the channel - closing ( cc ) number @xmath16 is determined with the _ true ionization potential _ ( eq .  ( [ eq : cc ] ) ) ; the use of any other value of effective ionization potential would shift each peak and consequently each curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : dual_h_and_ar ] by a different amount .",

    "in order to extract the periodicity of these structures quantitatively we calculate the power spectrum of @xmath78 where the multiplication by @xmath79 removes the smooth global decay ( fig .",

    "hence , we can derive the scaling of @xmath59 with @xmath0 to obtain , @xmath82 equation [ eq : formula_deltalambda1 ] reproduces the tdse - calculated @xmath0 dependence of @xmath70 quite well ( fig .",

    ", the time - dependent dipole moment @xmath126 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath127 i.e. , a sum over paths @xmath128 that start at the moment of tunnel ionization @xmath129 with amplitude @xmath130 , evolve in the laser field - acquire the phase @xmath131 - and recombine upon rescattering at the core at time @xmath132 with the amplitude @xmath133 .",
    "the interference oscillations in the hhg yield are controlled by the semiclassical action @xmath134 of the path @xmath128 , which reads : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the laser vector potential , and @xmath137 is the classical momentum of the returning trajectory .",
    "the effect of the coulomb potential can be incorporated into eq .",
    "( [ eq : semiclassical_phase ] ) with help of an eikonal approximation as a correction to the ( action ) phase with @xcite , @xmath138 clearly , the eikonal approximation would fail at small distances from the nucleus .",
    "this difficulty can by bypassed using the observation ( sec .  [",
    "se : truncated ] ) that at a cut - off @xmath86 a.u .",
    "the sfa limit of channel closings at integer values of @xmath16 is reached .",
    "consequently , we set @xmath139 when calculating the long - range phase correction .",

    "trajectory modifications due to the coulomb potential are small and can be neglected to first approximation @xcite , i.e. , we use the same sets of @xmath143 as in eq .",

    "it is now suggestive to express this additional phase in terms of a change in the  effective ionization potential \" , @xmath100 . accordingly , @xmath144 figure [ fi : ccct ] shows @xmath100 obtained by eq .",

    "remarkably , most trajectories ( save the shortest one ) behave qualitatively very similarly . in spite of its oversimplification",
    ", this coulomb - corrected model explains the behavior of @xmath100 even quantitatively well , which is a strong indication that the effect of the coulomb potential on the rescattering electronic motion is key to the understanding of the apparent peak shift in the wavelength - dependence of the hhg yield .",
    "using full numerical solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , we have found that the fundamental wavelength dependence of hhg with few - cycle pulses in the single - atom response features surprisingly strong oscillations on fine wavelength scales with modulation periods as small as 6 nm in the mid - infrared regime near @xmath145 m .",
    "thus , even a slight change in fundamental wavelength leads to strong variations in the hhg yield .",
    "this fine - scale rapid variation is the consequence of the interference of several rescattering trajectories with long excursion times , confirming the significance of multiple returns of the electron wavepacket @xcite .",
    "the present oscillations are closely related to similar regular peak - like enhancements of harmonic yield as a function of intensity @xmath19 @xcite , previously discussed in connection with channel closings .",
    "our analysis of the simultaneous wavelength - intensity - dependence has revealed that the spacing between adjacent peaks ( expressed in terms of the channel closing number @xmath16 ) is very accurately given by @xmath18 over a wide range of @xmath0 and @xmath19 .",
    "this corresponds to the spacing of adjacent channel closings as predicted by the strong - field approximation ( e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "the condition @xmath18 holds only if @xmath16 is defined with the true ionization potential .",
    "however , the peak positions are significantly shifted relative to integer values . the parametric dependence of the peak shift on the wavelength @xmath0 and the intensity @xmath19 has been investigated .",
    "our analysis shows that this peak shift can be accounted for by the effects of the coulomb tail on the motion of the returning electron .",
