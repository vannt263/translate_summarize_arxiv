    "it is by now well - known that the tsallis distribution gives excellent fits to the transverse momentum distributions observed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite and at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite with only three parameters , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( or , alternatively , a volume @xmath5  @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is referred to as the tsallis parameter and discussed elsewhere  @xcite in detail .    it was recently shown that these fits extend to values  @xcite of @xmath0 up to 200 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "this is unexpected because in this kinematic range hard scattering processes become important  @xcite .",
    "a description of the high @xmath0 results has been discussed in @xcite where a model using a combination of tsallis at low @xmath0 and qcd hard scattering at high @xmath0 was considered .",
    "the present analysis shows that the tsallis distribution describes measurements up to the highest @xmath0 using the same parameters as those obtained at low @xmath0 .",
    "a power law based on the tsallis distribution  @xcite is used to fit the @xmath0 spectra of charged particles measured by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "the atlas collaboration has reported the transverse momentum in an inclusive phase space region taking into account at least two charged particles in the kinematic range @xmath6 and @xmath7 mev  @xcite .",
    "the cms collaboration has presented the differential transverse momentum distribution covering a @xmath0 range up to 200 gev / c , the largest range ever measured in a colliding beam experiment  @xcite .",
    "the results can be compared to those obtained in  @xcite where very good fits to transverse momentum distributions were presented .",
    "we confirm the quality of the fits but obtain different values of the parameters albeit using a different version of the tsallis model .",
    "the tsallis distribution is defined as @xmath8^{-\\frac{1}{q-1 } } , \\ ] ] which at large energies behaves as @xmath9 so that the scale is set by @xmath3 and the asymptotic behaviour is set by @xmath2 . for high energy physics a consistent form of tsallis thermodynamics for the particle number density @xmath10 , energy density , @xmath11 , and pressure @xmath12 are given by  @xcite @xmath13^{-\\frac{q}{q-1 } } , \\\\",

    "this introduces only one new parameter @xmath2 which for transverse momentum spectra is always close to 1 .",
    "the consistency conditions @xmath16 are satisfied .",
    "this is shown explicitly for one of the relation @xmath17 .",
