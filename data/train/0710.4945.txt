    "the algorithmic aspects of weyl algebras were first explored by castro @xcite , galligo @xcite , takayama @xcite and others in the mid-1980s . in particular , they laid out a theory of grbner bases in this slightly non - commutative setting . since then , grbner bases in weyl algebras have been widely used for practical computations in algorithmic @xmath0-module theory as promoted in @xcite .",
    "( some authors @xcite prefer the term `` janet basis '' in this context , due to the pioneering work on linear differential operators by janet @xcite in the 1920s . ) in the early 1990s , kandri - rody and weispfenning @xcite , by isolating the features of weyl algebras which permit grbner basis theory to work , extended this theory to a larger class of non - commutative algebras , which they termed _",

    "in this paper we are interested in degree bounds for left grbner bases in algebras of solvable type .",
    "it follows trivially from the case of commutative polynomials ( as treated in @xcite ) and section  [ degree bounds for normal forms ] below that the degrees of the elements of the reduced grbner basis of a left ideal @xmath2 in an algebra of solvable type may depend doubly - exponentially on the maximum of the degrees of given generating elements of @xmath2 . in view of the popularity of this kind of non - commutative grbner basis theory , it is surprising that little seems to be known about _ upper degree bounds _ for grbner bases ( and , by extension , about the worst - case complexity of buchberger s algorithm ) in this setting .",
    "perhaps it was believed that the upper degree bound for one - sided grbner bases , at least in the context of weyl algebras , also follows from the commutative polynomial case by passing to the associated graded algebra for a certain filtration ( which turns out to be nothing but a commutative polynomial ring over the given coefficient field ) .",
    "if true , the problem would have boiled down to the doubly - exponential degree bounds for grbner bases in commutative polynomial rings over fields found in the 1980s ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that we _ could not find _ and we _ do not believe there exists _ a simple way to establish such a degree bound by reducing the question to commutative algebra .",
    "( see section  [ grobner bases and the associated graded algebra ] for further discussion . )    a general uniform degree bound for left grbner bases in algebras of solvable type was established by kredel and weispfenning @xcite ( using parametric grbner bases ) .",
    "they showed that , given a monomial ordering @xmath3 on @xmath4 , there exists a computable function @xmath5 with the following property : for every solvable algebra @xmath6 over some field , generated by @xmath7 generators whose commutator relations have degree at most @xmath8 , every left ideal of @xmath6 generated by @xmath9 elements of @xmath6 of degree at most @xmath8 has a grbner basis ( with respect to @xmath3 ) whose elements have degree at most @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast to this , here we are mainly interested in finding explicit , doubly - exponential degree bounds .",
    "we follow a road to establish such bounds paved by dub @xcite , who gave a self - contained and constructive combinatorial argument for the existence of a doubly - exponential degree bound for grbner bases in commutative polynomial rings over a field of arbitrary characteristic .",
    "earlier proofs of results of this type ( as in @xcite ) proceed by first homogenizing and then placing the ideal under consideration into _ generic coordinates . _",
    "the drawback of this method is that it seems difficult to adapt it to situations as general as the ones considered here ; for one thing , it only works smoothly in characteristic zero .",
    "see @xcite for the delicacies involved in using automorphisms of the weyl algebra .",
    "( developing the ideas of the latter paper further , a doubly - exponential complexity result for grbner bases in weyl algebras over fields of characteristic zero was established in @xcite ; the revised journal version of @xcite is @xcite . )",
    "the main new technical tool in @xcite are decompositions , called _",
    "cone decompositions , _ of commutative polynomial rings over a field @xmath1 into a direct sum of finitely many @xmath1-linear subspaces of a certain type .",
    "these decompositions generalize the _",
    "stanley decompositions _ of a given finitely generated commutative graded @xmath1-algebra @xmath6 studied in @xcite .",
    "a stanley decomposition of @xmath6 encodes a lot of information about @xmath6 ; for example , the hilbert function of @xmath6 can be easily read off from it .",
    "it has been noted in several other places in the literature that stanley decompositions are ideally suited to avoid the assumption of general position , and , for example , can also be used to circumvent the use of generic hyperplane sections in the proof of gotzmann s regularity theorem @xcite .",
    "the present paper grew out of an attempt by the authors to better understand dub s article @xcite .",
    "we modified the notions of cone decompositions and the argument of @xcite to work for a subclass of the class of algebras of solvable type over an arbitrary coefficient field @xmath1 , namely the ones whose commutation relations are given by _",

    "( similarly if one tries to use nagata s `` idealization '' technique as in @xcite . ) probably , corollary  [ corollary 2 to main theorem ] could be extended from a single linear equation to systems of linear equations with our techniques , by considering grbner bases of submodules of finitely generated free modules over @xmath6 , as carried out in @xcite in the case of weyl algebras .    by virtue of an observation from @xcite , our main theorem , although ostensibly only about one - sided ideals , also has consequences for their two - sided counterparts :    [ corollary 3 to main theorem ] let @xmath20 be of degree at most @xmath8 , and let @xmath21 .",

    "finally , we would like to mention that although our study is limited to the most frequently used type of bases , grbner bases , there are other kinds of `` standard bases '' for ideals that may be introduced for algebras of solvable type . for example , @xcite explores involutive bases in the weyl algebra .",
