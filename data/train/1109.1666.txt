    "control of the quantum dynamics of physical objects is a prerequisite for quantum technological applications .",
    "one important requirement is high - fidelity quantum state preparation .",
    "this often relies on cooling the physical system of interest to sufficiently low temperatures , such that a single quantum state , the ground state , is occupied with probability approaching unity .",
    "laser cooling constitutes in this respect a successful technique , which is routinely used in the preparation stage of experiments with atoms and ions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the various laser - cooling concepts and schemes which have been proposed and partly tested over the years are being considered for cooling molecules  @xcite and more complex objects , such as for instance phononic modes of micromechanical resonators to ultralow temperatures @xcite and condensed - phase systems @xcite .",
    "the idea at the basis of laser cooling of trapped particles is to enhance scattering processes leading to a net transfer of the oscillator mechanical energy to the electromagnetic - field modes .",
    "ground - state cooling of a harmonically - trapped particle , in particular , relies on a strong enhancement of the scattering processes which cool the oscillator , over the ones which heat the motion .",
    "several ground - state cooling techniques have been discussed that apply this basic concept in various ways @xcite .",
    "one scheme that is relevant to the study performed in this work is known in the literature as eit - cooling , where eit stands for electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , and it uses coherent population trapping @xcite due to quantum interference between laser - driven electronic transitions , in order to tailor the scattering cross section of the atoms to pursue ground - state cooling @xcite .",
    "the eit - cooling scheme extends the basic concepts of velocity - selective coherent population trapping for free atoms @xcite to trapped atoms , and has been experimentally demonstrated in refs .",
    "further studies can be also found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a further tool that is being increasingly considered in order to enhance scattering processes leading to trapping and cooling of atoms , is the strong coupling of one or more atomic transitions to a high - finesse optical resonator @xcite .",
    "for such a system it has been predicted that quantum interference effects can emerge from the quantized nature of the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "when in addition the field is interfaced with the atomic vibration in a trap via the mechanical action of light , further interference effects can emerge that can increase the cooling efficiency @xcite .",
    "the most recent observation of cavity - induced eit  @xcite , and of mechanical effects associated with it @xcite , leads to the natural question whether and how eit and cavity quantum electrodynamics can concur together to provide novel tools of control on the mechanical effects of atom - photon interactions .    in this paper",
    "we present a theoretical study of the mechanical effects of light on a trapped atom in a setup which supports cavity - induced eit .",
    "we show that the combination of eit and cavity quantum electrodynamics can give rise to a cooling mechanism , which for an accurate choice of parameters allows one to prepare the atoms in the ground state of the potential with probability approaching unity .",
    "remarkably , high efficiencies are found for the parameters of the experimental setup reported in ref .",
    "we show that the cooling dynamics can be often explained by means of a three - photon resonance @xcite , which involves cavity and laser photons . for certain parameter choices cooling results from interference in the mechanical effects of the atomic interaction with the cavity and laser fields .",
