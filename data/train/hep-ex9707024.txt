    "at the electron - proton ( @xmath5 ) hera collider , the study of dis is performed in an unique and optimal way up to values of the squared momentum transfer @xmath0 of @xmath6 gev@xmath2 .",
    "recently , the two hera collaborations h1 and zeus have reported  @xcite an excess of events at _ very high _ @xmath0 ( defined in the following as @xmath7 15000 gev@xmath2 ) compared to standard model expectations .",
    "this observation has triggered an important activity on `` beyond the standard model '' theories which might explain the effect  @xcite .",
    "the most favoured solution involves the production of a new resonance , which after its decay is kinematically similar to a standard deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) event .",
    "indeed , in the naive quark - parton model ( qpm ) , a parton carrying a fraction @xmath8 of the momentum of the proton scatters elastically against an electron and in the standard model , this interaction is representing a t - channel scattering occuring via the exchange of a gauge boson such as a photon or a @xmath9 . beyond the standard model , the naive qpm picture can represent the formation of an s - channel resonance ( generically called `` leptoquark '' ) subsequently followed by a two - body decay . while in the first interpretation the bjorken @xmath8 variable is one of the two relevant variables to characterize the scattering , in the second case",
    "the invariant mass @xmath10 of the system formed is the physical quantity of interest .",
    "this mass is related to @xmath8 in the naive qpm by @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the squared center of mass energy . in `` real '' interactions , the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "effects do not modify much this picture at large @xmath0 , since it is characterized in dis by the dominance of one electron + one partonic jet + one remnant jet in the final state , and is thus similar to the one in which a leptoquark is produced and decays in 2 bodies .",
    "so , when looking at high @xmath0 deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) in an inclusive way it is possible to distinguish between these two scenarios by comparing the event rates in different @xmath8 or @xmath10 intervals : the smooth evolution of the dis cross - section as a function of @xmath8 can be opposed to the appearance of a sharp peak in the invariant mass distribution , characteristic of a leptoquark .",
    "the hera effect is complicated by the fact that the invariant mass distributions of the event samples of the two collaborations differ : at a mass greater than 180 gev , the 7 h1 events appear clustered around a mass of 200 gev , while the 5 zeus events are broadly distributed between 191 and 253 gev .",
    "it is the subject of this paper to understand how significant is this difference and to provide a combined mass spectrum using the complete available information of these events in order to give an interpretation of the effect .    at hera",
    "the kinematic reconstruction does not need to rely on the scattered lepton only , since the most important part of the hadronic system is visible in the almost @xmath13 detectors h1 and zeus .",
    "this redundancy allows for an experimental control of the systematic errors and the radiative corrections , hence to determine in a more precise way the usual dis kinematic variables @xmath14 and @xmath0 which are defined as : + @xmath15 + @xmath16 being the 4-vectors of the incident proton and lepton , @xmath17 the scattered lepton one .    in this report",
    "we briefly review in section 2 the methods used at hera to determine the kinematics of the high @xmath0 events . in section 3",
    "we characterize the high @xmath0 region and introduce a new method which optimizes the kinematic reconstruction by determining the measurement errors on an event by event basis .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the detailed study of the very high @xmath0 hera events and discusses the mass distributions obtained .",
    "in order to introduce the kinematic methods used at hera in the high @xmath0 region let us start by a few definitions .",
    "the initial electron and proton ( beam ) energies are labeled @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the energy and polar angle axis is defined at hera as the incident proton beam direction .",
    "] of the scattered electron ( or positron ) are @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "after identification of the scattered electron , we can reconstruct the following independent hadronic quantities : @xmath22 , obtained as the sum of the scalar quantities @xmath23 associated to each particle belonging to the hadronic final state , @xmath24 as its total transverse momentum and define the hadronic inclusive angle @xmath25 : @xmath26 @xmath27 are the four - momentum vector components of every energy deposit in the calorimeter originating from any hadronic final state particle .",
    "the corresponding quantities for the scattered electron are @xmath28    out of these variables , it is possible to write the four methods which have been used to determine the invariant mass of the very high @xmath0 events ( the formulae are given in the appendix ) .",
    "- the electron only method ( @xmath29 ) based on e and @xmath21 .",
    "+ - the hadrons only method ( @xmath30 ) based on @xmath22 and @xmath24  @xcite . + - the double angle method ( da ) based on @xmath21 and @xmath25  @xcite . + - the sigma method ( @xmath31 ) based on e , @xmath21 and @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 method is precise at high @xmath32 but becomes less precise in @xmath14 or @xmath10 at low @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath30 method is the only one available for charged current events , but is less precise than the three others in neutral currents , so it will be ignored in the following .",
    "the da method is precise at high @xmath0 both at high and low @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath31 method is similar to the @xmath29 method at high @xmath32 and to the da at low @xmath32 apart from @xmath0 which is less precise .",
    "however it is insensitive to initial state qed radiation ( isr ) in m , @xmath32 and @xmath0 .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the properties of these methods and @xcite for their behaviour in presence of isr .",
    "it should be stressed that the quality of any kinematic reconstruction depends mainly on the precision achieved on the observables , such as e , @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath25 .",
    "it is one of the major tasks of the experiments to obtain precise and unbiased quantities , and several techniques have been developped in the hera structure function analyses to achieve these goals .",
    "we refer to the original publications for a description of these studies  @xcite , which discuss for instance how the electron energy is calibrated , or how the hadronic final state is measured at low @xmath32 , when the hadronic jets are in the vicinity of the beam pipe .",
    "at _ high _ @xmath0 ( defined in the following as @xmath7 2500 gev@xmath2 ) the kinematic reconstruction is in general more precise than at low @xmath0 and indeed the differences between the results obtained with the methods seen above are small .",
    "however since the number of events drops rapidly with increasing @xmath0 it is still crucial to optimize the reconstruction by making a full use of all the observables of these events .    the improvements on the reconstruction at high @xmath0 come mainly from the better measurement of the hadronic final state",
    "this is due to the fact that i ) the individual hadron energy is on average greater ; ii ) the losses in the beam pipe and in the material in front of the calorimeter are in proportion smaller than at low @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath31 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are less affected by these losses ; iii ) the hadronic final state displays more often a ( single ) collimated jet configuration .",
    "this is due both to kinematics ( events are in average at higher @xmath8 ) , and to the smaller gluon radiation and power corrections ( @xmath33 is smaller ) .",
    "all these characteristics enable a precise measurement of the hadronic angle , and thus are particularly favourable to the da method which indeed becomes more accurate with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this method has however the drawback to be very sensitive to isr and it is thus difficult to apply to a small number of events .",
    "for instance , the isr of a 2.75  gev photon , if not taken into account produces a shift of 10% on the reconstructed mass and 20% on @xmath0 . in order to overcome this drawback",
    "we introduce a new method which , by making use of the precision on @xmath25 , estimates _ from the data _ on an event by event basis the shift in the measurement of @xmath20 and @xmath31 , denoted in the following @xmath34 with @xmath35 or @xmath31 .",
    "these shifts allow i )  the @xmath31 method to be corrected ; ii ) the presence of an undetected initial state photon ( down to an energy of about 2 gev ) to be identified with high efficiency , and therefore to correct for it .",
    "let us assume that there is no isr ( the specific treatment of isr is discussed in the next section , although the two steps are not separated in the procedure ) , and that @xmath21 and @xmath25 are precisely measured ( implying @xmath37 ) . from energy momentum conservation the two following equations can be derived : @xmath38 under these assumptions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are determined on an event by event basis .",
    "varying @xmath21 and @xmath25 within their typical errors , the @xmath25 resolution improves to 30 mrad .",
    "we use here the r.m.s . , rather than the standard deviation obtained from a gaussian fit to the distribution , to take into account non - gaussian tails which contribute in the propagation of the systematic errors .",
    "] ( 5 and 40 mrad ( r.m.s . ) respectively , at high @xmath0 )",
    "we can obtain the errors arising from the angular measurements on @xmath39 and @xmath40 . a more direct way to see the uncertainties arising from this determination",
    "is illustrated in fig.1 , in which the error on @xmath20 and @xmath31 reconstructed using equations 3 and 4 are compared to their `` true '' value , which is known for the reconstructed simulated events .",
    "for a given event , the error on @xmath41 , which is defined as @xmath42 , is of the same order as the r.m.s .",
    "( denoted @xmath43 ) of the @xmath44 distribution obtained from a large sample ( fig.1b ) , showing that its use will not bring an improvement on an event by event basis . on the other side ,",
    "the relative error on @xmath45 is smaller , about 30% of @xmath46 , and diminishes at high @xmath32 ( compare fig.1e to 1f , and 1b to 1c ) implying that correcting @xmath31 will provide a better kinematic measurement , in particular at high @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath36 kinematic variables are thus derived from the @xmath22 ones by including the effect of @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 the comparison of the @xmath36 and @xmath31 reconstruction of m , @xmath32 and @xmath0 for high @xmath0 events fully simulated in the h1 detector is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the improvement obtained by the recalibration of @xmath31 is clearly visible , allowing this method to be compared favourably to the original ones .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig.3 for high @xmath0 events ( in all the high @xmath0 section , an @xmath49 cut against hard initial state radiation is applied , see next section ) both at high @xmath32 and at low @xmath32 . at high @xmath32 @xmath50 ) , the @xmath29 and the @xmath36 methods are comparable in @xmath10 and @xmath32 and slightly better than the da one ( fig.3a , b ) . in @xmath0 , the da displays the narrowest peak both at high and low @xmath32 ( fig.3c , f ) , but its high sensitivity to isr induces tails in the distribution which renders its r.m.s .",
    "larger than the @xmath36 and @xmath29 ones . at low @xmath32 ( @xmath51 the @xmath29 method has a relatively poor resolution in m , much worse than the @xmath36 one which is slightly better than the da one . in conclusion , for the high @xmath0 events the @xmath36 method is similar or slightly better than the @xmath29 and da method .",
    "the influence of isr is taken into account in the simulation programs used by the hera experiments , but on a small number of events it is difficult to control the migration due to an unseen isr photon when using the @xmath29 and da methods .",
    "both h1 and zeus use an experimental cut on the total @xmath49 of the event ( @xmath52 ) or equivalently on the normalized @xmath49 called hereafter @xmath53 for the electron and for the hadronic final state satisfy : @xmath54 ; @xmath55 . ] and defined as @xmath56 the @xmath49 cuts used in h1 and zeus correspond to good approximation to @xmath57 and prevent an isr photon from carrying away more than about 25% of the incident electron energy .",
    "such a photon can induce a large shift to the reconstructed mass  @xcite of @xmath58 for @xmath59 ( i.e. @xmath60 at @xmath61 ) and of 25% on @xmath62 at any @xmath32 .",
    "on @xmath63 the shift is zero since the method is independent of colinear isr for m@xmath64 and @xmath0 .",
    "a more stringent cut on @xmath53 is difficult to implement due to the experimental resolutions on @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath36 method allows isr to be identified with high efficiency for @xmath53 as high as @xmath67 .",
    "it makes use of the simple fact that depending on the origin of the @xmath53 shift ( which comes mainly either from isr or from hadronic miscalibration ) , the errors obtained with the @xmath36 method have a completely different pattern : for example if the observed @xmath53 is 1@xmath68 , equations 3 and 4 will give for the isr case @xmath69 and @xmath70 , assuming negligible detector smearing , while for the hadronic miscalibration case , assuming negligible error on the electron energy , we will get @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "these two different types of pattern allow isr to be identified even in the presence of detector smearing , as studied on a complete simulation in the h1 detector , with typically 85% efficiency at high @xmath0 for photon energies",
    "greater than 2 gev .",
    "the exact conditions for isr identification of a 2 gev photons is @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "however , to take into account the detector smearing we use instead : @xmath75 these can be slightly varied depending on the isr identification efficiency requested .",
    "these conditions will `` misidentify '' high @xmath0 non - radiative events in less than 3% of the cases in the h1 detector , implying that in the total sample of isr identified events , the fraction of genuine isr events is higher than the fraction of non - radiative events .",
    "this fraction increases with increasing @xmath0 since the hadronic angle becomes more precise , i.e. the isr identification becomes more efficient . in case of isr identification ,",
    "the equations 3 and 4 are solved again after recalculating @xmath66 and @xmath65 using @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 .",
    "the improvement obtained can be visualized in fig.4 which shows the same distributions as in fig.3 but on the sample of dis high @xmath0 events having radiated an isr photon of 2 gev or more .",
    "the dramatic improvement underlines the importance of controlling experimentally the radiation effect .",
    "furthermore , the soft isr photons which can not be identified below 2 gev have a small effect on @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) but still a sizeable one on @xmath62 , up to about 7% , or 4% on @xmath59 .",
    "let us remind some characteristics of the excess of events at high @xmath0 observed by the h1 and zeus collaborations in the data collected from 1994 to 1996  @xcite . at @xmath80 gev@xmath2 , 24 events have been observed for an expectation of 13.4@xmath41.0 , representing a probability of 0.0074  @xcite .",
    "furthermore some of these events exhibit the additional characteristics either to cluster around a rather precise value of the invariant mass of the produced system ( m@xmath81 gev , for 7 events out of the 12 of h1 , while @xmath82 are expected ) , or to lie at very high invariant mass ( m@xmath83 gev and @xmath84 , for 4 events out of the 12 of zeus , while @xmath85 are expected ) .",
    "actually the messages of these two observations could be different as already pointed out  @xcite and we will try here to explore further this point with the use of our new kinematic tool .    among the obvious possible reasons for the difference",
    "are the influence of isr which can strongly distort a distribution based on a small number of events , or the effect of a specific miscalibration .",
    "the @xmath36 method having been devised to respond to these problems , we can now study in more details the 11 extreme events mentioned above for which the complete kinematic information has been published by the two collaborations .",
    "we add to this sample 2 events and systematic shifts between @xmath29 and da variables of the 5 other zeus published events .",
    "this assumption has a negligible influence on the conclusions drawn below . ] from zeus in order to include all events which satisfy the condition @xmath80 gev@xmath2 and m@xmath86 gev , since we want to test the significance of the h1 event clustering at masses around 200 gev over the complete very high @xmath0 hera sample .      in table 1",
    "are given the m , @xmath32 and @xmath0 of the 13 events at very high @xmath0 and high mass reconstructed with the four different methods discussed above .",
    "the values of m , @xmath32 and @xmath0 are identical to those published for the @xmath29 and da methods .",
    "the @xmath31 values have been released recently by h1  @xcite and can be computed straightforwardly for the zeus events .",
    "the errors are also reproduced exactly except for those of the @xmath29 method to which we conservatively added quadratically an error of 1.5% ( i.e. half of the absolute energy scale uncertainty of 3% given by the two experiments ) to account for potential miscalibrations between the different regions of the detectors . as we will see below the overall energy calibration can be checked to be well under control .    for the errors not published by the collaborations ( @xmath36 , @xmath31 for h1 and zeus , and da for h1 ) we used the following prescription , which was checked to be consistent with the other published errors :",
    "they are obtained here using a possible error of @xmath87 mrad and @xmath88 mrad for the electron and hadronic angle respectively .",
    "for the error on the electron ( hadronic ) energy we used @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) for h1 and @xmath91 ( @xmath90 ) for zeus , which includes for the electron case both resolution effects , dead material corrections and the 1.5% overall error just mentioned .",
    "these two values for the electron energy error have been checked on the data ( see below ) .",
    "additional sizeable errors as published by the collaborations , due for instance to special energy corrections , have been taken into account in two events ( h3,z1 ) .",
    "for the h1 events the errors of an event are similar for each method , with a slight advantage for the @xmath29 method at @xmath32 above 0.5 . for the zeus events the da errors are the smallest , since the error on the electron energy which is somewhat larger than in the h1 case has an influence on the 3 other methods .",
    "this also explains why the zeus collaboration chooses the da method rather than the @xmath29 method favoured by h1 .",
    "also mentioned is the result of the @xmath36 isr identification , and we can see that 2 events ( h5 and z4 ) are classified as radiative , and have been corrected accordingly .",
    "these 2 events indeed show the characteristics of a radiative event , i.e. there exists a value of @xmath92 for which the following equations , which hold exactly if there were no detector effects , are verified in a good approximation : @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 indeed in the case of h5 a photon with an energy ( 2.9 gev)consistent with the @xmath97 derived from the previous equations is observed in the special photon calorimeter located close to the beam pipe and designed to measure photons emitted collinearly to the incident electron , such as isr photons . the isr effect on the mass is sizeable , since @xmath98 = 1.08 for h5 and 1.11 for z4 .",
    "both values are consistent with the determined @xmath99 and @xmath100 of these events ( see tab.1 ) .",
    "the reconstructed kinematics are consistent between the different methods except for the 2 radiative events and for the events displaying a significant difference between @xmath59 and @xmath62 ( events h7,z1,z5 ) , which indeed have the largest @xmath99 and/or @xmath100 .    on these small samples of events , and after isr corrections , the averages of the  absolute value of the error on the hadronic energy are similar for h1 and zeus ( @xmath101= 6% compared to 5% ) , while on the electron energy the h1 average error is smaller : @xmath102=3% compared to 5% for zeus",
    ".    the uncertainty on the electromagnetic absolute energy scale can be estimated _ from the data _ using @xmath103 ( the 2 radiative events are excluded from these means ) which gives @xmath104 for h1 and @xmath105 for zeus , both values in good agreement with the value of 3% given by the collaborations .",
    "the uncertainty on the hadronic absolute energy is obtained similarly and gives @xmath106 for h1 and @xmath107 for zeus , also in acceptable agreement with the values quoted by the collaborations .",
    "after all these consistency checks , the use of the @xmath36 method in the two samples will now allow a consistent mass distribution to be derived from the very high @xmath0 events .",

    "in any case ( radiative or not ) it would not survive the @xmath113 cut , which is one of the 2 conditions the final sample must satisfy .",
    "note `` en passant '' that its mass is reduced from @xmath62=232 gev to @xmath78=207 gev .",
    "the mass distributions of the remaining 12 events , obtained with the @xmath114 da , @xmath31 and @xmath36 , are displayed in fig.5a , b , d , e .",
    "the event z4 has the highest mass at @xmath115 gev .",
    "it is identified as a radiative event and its mass is reduced by the @xmath36 determination to @xmath116 gev , thereby reducing the scattering appearance of the zeus events .",
    "note that the error quoted on the da mass is much smaller than the effect due to radiation .",
    "for the 5 zeus events the weighted average mass is decreased from m@xmath117=226@xmath118 gev to m@xmath119=216@xmath120 gev . actually with the @xmath36 determination 4 out of",

    "would require to miscalibrate uniformly the electron energy of the h1 events at least by + 6% and the zeus events by @xmath125% , values completely incompatible with the absolute scale uncertainties found in the previous section .",
    "note however , that the h1 events alone support the narrow resonance hypothesis .",
    "since after the @xmath36 kinematic treatment none of the 12 events migrates outside the very high @xmath0 and mass region , we confirm that the visible excess published by the collaborations at very high @xmath0 is not due to detector ( calibration ) or radiation ( isr ) effects .",
    "we have introduced a new reconstruction method ( `` @xmath36 '' ) which allows the kinematic variables of the high @xmath0 events to be determined in a more precise way .",

    "however none of the zeus events enter the h1 accumulation region . taking the estimation of the systematic errors at face value",
    ", this suggests that , if the observed excess at very high @xmath0 is due to physics beyond the standard model , it is unlikely to be explained by the decay of a single narrow resonance such as a leptoquark .",
    "the increase of the integrated luminosity in the current and in the future years at hera will clarify the origin of this effect .      we would like to thank the two collaborations for the data we have studied in this paper . in particular this work has taken place within the h1 collaboration , and some of the results obtained were the outcome of the efforts of many people of the `` beyond the standard model '' group to get the analysis of the very high @xmath0 events completed .",
