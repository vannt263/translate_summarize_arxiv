    "an important issue for new physics of any kind is whether it can be discovered or excluded in collider searches given backgrounds arising from the standard model ( sm ) . in particular , within a specific model , it is crucial to know how well a given set of experimental analyses can probe the full parameter space of interest . with the lack of any experimental evidence for new physics",
    "so far , this is certainly true in the case of supersymmetry ( susy ) , which is the most widely studied theory beyond the sm . however , even in the simplest susy scenario",
    ", the mssm , the number of free parameters ( @xmath1 100 ) is too large to study in complete generality .",
    "the traditional approach is to assume the existence of some high - scale theory with only a few parameters ( such as msugra    @xcite ) from which all the properties of the sparticles at the tev scale can be determined and studied in detail .",
    "while such an approach is often quite valuable  @xcite , these scenarios are somewhat phenomenologically limiting and are under increasing tension with a wide range of experimental data including , in some cases , the @xmath2 gev mass of the recently discovered higgs boson@xcite .",
    "one way to circumvent such limitations is to examine the more general 19/20-parameter pmssm@xcite .",
    "the increased dimensionality of the parameter space not only allows for a more unprejudiced study of susy , but can also yield valuable information on ` unusual ' scenarios , identify weaknesses in the current lhc analyses and can be used to combine results obtained from many independent susy - related searches . to these ends , we have recently embarked on a detailed study of the signatures for the pmssm at the 7 and 8 tev lhc , supplemented by input from dark matter ( dm ) experiments as well as from precision electroweak and flavor measurements@xcite . the pmssm is the most general version of the r - parity conserving mssm when it is subjected to a minimal set of experimentally - motivated guiding principles : ( @xmath3 ) cp conservation , ( @xmath4 ) minimal flavor violation at the electroweak scale so that flavor physics is controlled by the ckm mixing matrix , ( @xmath5 ) degenerate 1^st^ and 2^nd^ generation sfermion masses , and ( @xmath6 ) negligible yukawa couplings and a - terms for the first two generations . in particular , no assumptions are made about physics at high scales , e.g. , the nature of susy breaking , in order to capture electroweak scale phenomenology for which a uv - complete theory may not yet exist . imposing these principles ( @xmath3)-(@xmath6 ) decreases the number of free parameters in the mssm at the tev - scale from 105 to 19 for the case of a neutralino lsp , or to 20 when the gravitino mass is included as an additional parameter when it plays the role of the lsp .",
    "we have not assumed that the lsp relic density necessarily saturates the wmap / planck value@xcite in order to allow for the possibility of multi - component dm .",
    "for example , the axions introduced to solve the strong cp problem may may make up a substantial amount of dm .",
    "the 19/20 pmssm parameters and the ranges of values employed in our scans are listed in table  [ scanranges ] . like throwing darts , to study the pmssm we generate many millions of model points in this space ( using softsusy@xcite and checking for consistency with suspect@xcite ) , with each point then corresponding to a specific set of values for these parameters .",
    "these individual models are then subjected to a large set of collider , flavor , precision measurement , dark matter and theoretical constraints  @xcite .",
    "roughly @xmath1225k models with either type of lsp survive this initial selection and can then be used for further physics studies .",
    "decay patterns of the susy partners and the extended higgs sector are calculated using privately modified versions of susy - hit  @xcite , calchep  @xcite , and madgraph  @xcite . since our",
    "scan ranges include sparticle masses up to 4 tev , an upper limit chosen to enable phenomenological studies at the 14 tev lhc , the neutralinos and charginos in either of our model sets are typically very close to being in a pure electroweak eigenstate as the off - diagonal elements of the corresponding mass matrices are at most @xmath7 .    in addition to these two large pmssm model sets , we have recently generated a smaller , specialized neutralino lsp set of @xmath1 10.2k ` natural ' models , all of which predict @xmath8 gev , have an lsp that _ does _ saturate the wmap relic density and produce values of fine - tuning ( ft ) better than @xmath9 using the ellis - barbieri - giudice measure  @xcite .",
    "this low - ft model set will also be used as part of the present study . in order to obtain this model set we modified the parameter scan ranges listed in table  [ scanranges ] to greatly increase the likelihood that a chosen point will satisfy the combined relic density , higgs mass , and ft constraints . amongst other things ,",
    "satisfying these requirements necessitates a bino at the bottom of the spectrum as well as light higgsinos and highly - mixed stops .",
    "we generated @xmath10 low - ft points in this 19-parameter space and subjected them to updated precision , flavor , dm and collider constraints as before . since",
    "our requirements were much stricter here than for our two larger model sets only @xmath1 10.2k low - ft models survive for further study .",
    "we now subject these three sets of pmssm models to the susy searches performed at the 7 and 8 tev lhc , as well as planned searches at 14 tev .",
    ".scan ranges for the 19 ( 20 ) parameters of the pmssm with a neutralino ( gravitino ) lsp .",
    "the gravitino mass is scanned with a log prior .",
    "all other parameters are scanned with flat priors , though we expect this choice to have little qualitative impact on our results  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     briefly stated our procedure is as follows : we generate susy events for each model for all relevant ( up to 85 ) production channels in pythia 6.4.26  @xcite , and then pass the events through fast detector simulation using pgs 4  @xcite .",
    "both programs have been modified to , e.g. , correctly deal with gravitinos , multi - body decays , hadronization of stable colored sparticles , and atlas b - tagging .",
    "we then scale our event rates to nlo by calculating the relevant k - factors using prospino 2.1  @xcite .",
    "the individual searches are then implemented using our customized analysis code@xcite , which follows the published cuts and selection criteria as closely as possible .",
    "this analysis code is validated for each of the many search regions in every analysis employing the benchmark model points provided by atlas ( and cms ) .",
    "models are then excluded using the 95% @xmath11 limits as obtained by atlas ( and cms ) . for the two large model sets these analyses",
    "are performed _ without _ requiring the higgs mass constraint , @xmath8 gev ( combined experimental and theoretical errors ) so that we can understand its influence on the search results .",
    "note that roughly @xmath12 of models in the neutralino ( gravitino ) model set predict a higgs mass in the above range . while there is some variation amongst the individual searches themselves ,",
    "we find that , once combined , the total fraction of our models surviving the set of all lhc searches is to an excellent approximation _ independent _ of whether or not the higgs mass constraint has been applied .",
    "conversely , the @xmath13 fraction of neutralino ( gravitino ) models predicting the correct higgs mass is also found to be approximately independent of whether the susy searches have been applied .",
    "these results can best be seen explicitly in fig .",
    "[ figm1 ] , which shows the predicted higgs mass distribution in the neutralino model set both before and after the lhc susy searches have been applied .",
    "this result is very powerful and demonstrates the approximate decoupling of susy search results from the discovery of the higgs boson which allows us to continue examining the entire model set for either lsp type with some reasonable validity . to a similar approximation",
    ", we find that the results for the distribution of higgs branching fractions in the pmssm are also insensitive to the lhc susy searches as demonstrated in detail in our companion higgs white paper@xcite .",
    "we first discuss the results of our analysis for the case of the neutralino lsp model set .",
    "the first important question to address is how well the combination of lhc searches cover the pmssm parameter space .",
    "one way to address this is to project 2-dimensional slices in the multi - dimensional space of sparticle masses and show the exclusion efficiency of the combined lhc searches within specified mass ranges .",
    "the results of this procedure for some of the sparticles in the general neutralino pmssm model set are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig00 ] ,  [ fig1 ] ,  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] .",
    "in addition , tables  [ searchlist7 ] and  [ searchlist8 ] provide further information by listing the fraction of the neutralino pmssm set ( as well as for the corresponding gravitino and low - ft model sets ) that is excluded for each of the individual lhc searches . combining all of the searches we find that @xmath14 of these neutralino lsp models are currently excluded .",
    "clearly this implies that a large fraction of the excluded models are eliminated by more than one search .",

    "we see that the region excluded by the atlas simplified model analysis ( below and to the left of the white line ) in the gluino - lsp mass plane roughly encircles the all - black region which is excluded by our combination of analyses .",
    "this is interesting as while the atlas simplified model result is based solely on a jets + met analysis under the assumption of decoupled squarks in the left panel , ours is a combination of _ many _ analyses , making no additional assumptions about the sparticle spectra under consideration .",
    "as can be seen here , most of the surviving light gluino models have relatively compressed mass spectra although a few of them evade detection by having rather complex decay patterns .",
    "the lightest squark - gluino panel shows that many models survive that are far below the atlas simplified model exclusion line ( where degenerate squarks and a massless lsp have been assumed ) as might be expected from the rather more complex spectra in the pmssm .",

    "that whereas the simplified model treatment by atlas arising from searches at 7 ( solid ) and 8 ( dashed ) tev qualitatively describes the coverage in the sbottom - lsp mass plane ( though this is again somewhat accidental ) , it is entirely inadequate for stop searches .",
    "one reason for this is that many of the searches for sbottoms ( in particular that for two b - jets , zero leptons + met inclusive ) can also strongly constrain models with light stops . as we will see below",
    ", even non-3^rd^-generation searches play an important role in obtaining the exclusion regions shown here .",
    "we note here that we have not incorporated atlas searches involving taus in the final state as pgs has a strong tendency to lead to a large mis - tag rate while having a simultaneously low tau tagging efficiency .",
    "thus the exclusions we see in the lower panel of this figure ( which is relatively uniform in density as might be expected from these arguments ) is actually the result of the non - tau searches .",

    "it is informative to examine this aspect in a bit more detail .",
    "the search coverage for the first and second generation squarks are shown individually in fig .",
    "conventionally , lhc searches assume that these 4 squark states are degenerate , but here in the pmssm where their masses can be different ( except for the symmetry breaking relationship between the masses of @xmath19 and @xmath17 ) we see that the searches lead to quite different coverage for these sparticles .",
    "these differences are generally easy to understand and are essentially related to the relative sizes of the production cross sections for these sparticles .",
    "since @xmath19 and @xmath17 are relatively degenerate they are produced simultaneously with somewhat similar rates ( although that for @xmath17 is somewhat suppressed due to the smaller @xmath20-quark parton densities ) and , one might expect similar , though not completely identical , exclusion rates .",

    "are uncorrelated so that they will produce a smaller signal than the corresponding left - handed states ; again , for identical masses , @xmath18 will have a smaller production rate due to the pdfs . in the figure",
    "we see that exclusions for either of these right - handed squarks is rather poor even though all they can do is decay to the bino components available in the lighter gauginos .",
    "in particular , we see that @xmath18 masses as low as @xmath21 gev remain possible with lsp masses in the range of @xmath22 gev",

    ".    having available the individual results of many different susy search analyses we next examine and compare their various strengths and weaknesses .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] provides an example of this where we compare the impact of the `` vanilla '' jets ( + leptons ) + met analyses ( entries 1 - 3 in table  [ searchlist7 ] and 1 - 4 in table  [ searchlist7 ] ) and the combination of the 3^rd^ generation searches in the lightest stop- and lightest sbottom - lsp mass plane along with the corresponding simplified model results obtained by atlas at both 7 ( solid ) and 8 tev ( dashed ) . here",
    "the red ( blue ) bins indicate regions in the parameter space where most of the exclusion arises from the `` vanilla '' ( 3^rd^ generation ) searches while green indicates a balance between these two extremes .",
    "in fact , most of the regions in both panels are green , indicating that both types of searches are having comparable impact in excluding models .",
    "however , in the upper portion of the plots near the kinematic boundary we see that the `` vanilla '' searches are more powerful , probably because of low b - tagging efficiencies for soft b - jets , while for small lsp masses we see that the 3^rd^ generation searches are dominating the exclusion . clearly these types of results may change substantially as we add additional searches using the full luminosity available at 8 tev .",
    "we now examine the gravitino lsp model set .",
    "the preliminary results found here differ from that for the neutralino lsp model set for numerous reasons as outlined in ref .",
    "the distinctive phenomenology of gravitino lsp models mostly arises from the fact that the nlsp has a strongly suppressed coupling to the gravitino , with the result that the nlsp decay is displaced by a millimeter or more for most gravitino masses we consider .",
    "this has important implications for the standard susy searches ; visible products from displaced decays may be rejected or may cause the whole event to be rejected by failing quality cuts designed to suppress large backgrounds from pileup .",
    "alternatively , if a charged nlsp lives long enough to traverse the detector , it will not be counted as missing energy , making the standard met - based searches ineffective .",
    "of course , long - lived nlsps also create new signals which can be even more striking than the original met - based signature , as occurs when the nlsp lives long enough to be seen in searches for heavy stable charged particles ( hscps ) .",
    "another key difference from the neutralino lsp case is that the gravitino lsp is effectively massless in nearly all of our models . as a result ,",
    "compressed spectra ( which provide one of the most effective mechanisms for hiding light sparticles when the lsp is a neutralino ) are only possible when the nlsp is a sneutrino ( which decays invisibly to a gravitino and a neutrino ) or a detector - stable neutralino .",
    "a summary of the results of the 7 and 8 tev lhc searches applied to the gravitino model set can be seen in tables  [ searchlist7 ] and [ searchlist8 ] .",
    "we see that the atlas susy searches have a very different sensitivity to models with a gravitino lsp than to neutralino lsp models , as we anticipated .",
    "in particular , we see significant differences in the fraction of models excluded by each search , and the fraction of models excluded by the combination of these searches is substantially higher for the gravitino lsp model set .",
    "specifically , we see that @xmath26 of the gravitino lsp models are excluded by the combination of all 7 and 8 tev searches , a result which is found to be rather insensitive to the @xmath27 gev mass requirement .",
    "the differences in the exclusion power of the combined atlas searches for models with neutralino or gravitino lsps are displayed in the figures to be discussed below , which show the results analogous to those presented in the previous subsection , but now shown for the gravitino lsp model set .",
    "first , we must note that the phenomenological differences between the two model sets make the results difficult to compare directly .",
    "the most important difference is that the neutralino lsp is not only a source of met , but also forms a ` kinematic boundary ' for particle decays where the nlsp has a mass in the few hundred gev range , since the lsp and nlsp generally have masses of comparable magnitudes .",
    "additionally , the nlsp does not necessarily appear in cascade decays of heavier sparticles .",
    "for gravitino lsp models , on the other hand , the nlsp plays a critical role in the phenomenology , since it is almost invariably produced as the penultimate step in cascade decays , due to the very weak gravitino - sparticle interactions .",
    "if the nlsp decays within the detector to visible decay products , they generally have large transverse momentum ( because the nlsp mass splitting with a massless gravitino is just the nlsp mass ) , and as a result these decay products are often the most important handle for distinguishing susy production from backgrounds . alternatively ,",
    "if the nlsp is detector - stable , its identity determines whether production of any sparticle will ultimately result in a sm + met or a sm + heavy charged track final state .",
    "the nature of the nlsp is therefore crucial for determining the collider signature for a given gravitino lsp model .",
    "based on this discussion , we can divide gravitino models into several categories based on the following properties of the nlsp : ( @xmath3 ) whether of not it produces a charged track or visible decay products ( invisibly - decaying nlsps and neutral nlsps which are detector stable are recorded only as met ) and ( @xmath4 ) the decay length of the nlsp , , whether its decay is prompt @xmath28 or displaced @xmath29 , or the nlsp is detector stable @xmath30 .",
    "( the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are chosen as the approximate length scales for displacements from the primary vertex allowed by quality cuts and the decay length necessary for the nlsp to be seen by the hscp search , respectively . ) clearly the sensitivity of the atlas susy searches will depend strongly on how the model is categorized according to these criteria .         fig .",
    "[ fig1 g ] provides a summary of the impact of lhc searches on models with gravitino lsps , analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig00 ] above for the neutralino lsp model set . for the left panel ,",
    "it is important to note that here the mass on the @xmath33axis is that of the nlsp and not that of the gravitino and that here we have summed over all the nlsp scenarios described above .",
    "overall , the searches perform quite favorably compared to what we found for the neutralino model set , although the excluded regions are qualitatively similar . on the gluino - nlsp mass plot",
    "we see that the area of complete coverage is somewhat smaller than that found in the corresponding gluino - lsp plot for the neutralino set .",
    "however , in the gravitino lsp case we see that the `` mostly excluded '' region of orange and red bins includes all nlsp masses for gluinos below 1200 gev . for the neutralino model set ,",
    "there are bins in which most models remain viable ( indicated by a green or blue color ) with gluino masses as light as 800 gev .",
    "again , this is because energetic nlsp decay products ( or a massive charged track ) may be seen regardless of the sparticle - nlsp splitting . in the lightest ( 1^st^/2^nd^ generation )",
    "squark - gluino mass plane shown in the second panel we again see somewhat similar coverage to that for neutralino lsp models , but once again the `` mostly excluded '' region ranges up to much higher gluino and squark masses than in the neutralino lsp models .",
    "of course we reemphasize that the two model sets differ in many quantitative aspects .",
    "it is interesting to see how these gravitino lsp search results change when we select various subsets of models according to the nlsp categories we defined above ; these results are shown projected onto the familiar lightest squark - gluino mass plane in fig .",
    "[ fig2 g ] . comparing the upper right panel with the other three panels",
    ", we see that models wherein the nlsp or its decay products can be seen in the detector are far more strongly constrained than models in which the nlsp produces only met , in which case the standard compressed spectrum scenario arises when the nlsp is closely split with the sparticle of interest . not surprisingly , the results for models with invisible nlsps are quite similar to the results for the neutralino lsp model set ( compare the upper right panel with the right panel of fig .  [ fig00 ] ) .",
    "we can also see the reduced sensitivity to models with displaced nlsp decays , shown by the presence of surviving models with lighter squarks and gluinos in the upper left panel ( showing models with displaced nlsp decays ) compared with the lower left panel ( showing models with prompt nlsp decays ) .",
    "finally , the lower right panel shows that the exclusion limits for models with detector - stable charged or colored nlsps are particularly strong , which is what we would expect given the low backgrounds and high sensitivity that characterize searches for heavy stable charged particles ( hscps ) .",
    "one important difference between hscp and met based searches is that the former are sensitive to electroweak production of fairly heavy sparticles ( e.g. 600 gev charginos ) , whereas the met - based searches have little direct sensitivity to particles with only electroweak interactions .",
    "this sharp distinction is demonstrated by the fact that the fraction of models with hscps that are excluded by the current searches is still @xmath34 even when the squarks and gluino are kinematically inaccessible ; by comparison , only @xmath35 of models with inaccessible squarks and gluinos and a decaying or invisible nlsp are excluded .",
    "we can further investigate the effect of quality cuts removing or vetoing on displaced objects by comparing the subset of models with visible nlsp decay products with the subset of models in which the nlsp decay products are both visible _ and _ prompt .",
    "we see that the search reach in the gluino - nlsp mass plane , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 g ] , is significantly better for models with prompt decays .",
    "this results from the application of quality cuts that remove displaced objects , or even reject events with displaced objects , in the standard susy searches , combined with the fact that the current atlas searches for displaced decays are not optimized for nlsps decaying to gravitinos ( the disappearing track search has strong isolation requirements which veto the hard nlsp decay products , the displaced dilepton search requires the dilepton pair momentum to be aligned with the parent particle momentum , which is unlikely since the gravitino shares some of the parent momentum , and the muon + displaced vertex search requires a jet and a high-@xmath36 muon from the same vertex , which is not a standard nlsp decay signature ) .",
    "however , we note that despite the stringent quality cuts , the search reach for models with displaced nlsp decays yielding visible decay products is still better than that for models with invisible nlsps .",
    "one possible reason for the remaining sensitivity to models with metastable nlsps is that quality cuts that remove displaced jets from an event do nt remove their contribution to the event s missing energy , meaning that the missing energy does not suffer from the same suppression as it would in the case of an invisible nlsp near the gluino mass .",
    "we saw above that the sensitivity of atlas searches to individual squarks is greatly reduced compared to the case where the squarks are degenerate .",
    "this lack of sensitivity to individual light squarks is even more striking for models with a gravitino lsp .",
    "[ fig4 g ] shows the susy search coverages for the various 1^st^/2^nd^ generation squarks in the squark - nlsp mass plane ; note that since @xmath19 and @xmath17 are produced together the coverage in these two cases is quite similar , as we saw for the neutralino lsp model set in section  [ sec : neutlsp ] .",
    "here we see that the search reaches appear to be substantially reduced for the gravitino lsp models in all cases when compared with their reaches in the corresponding planes in the neutralino lsp model set .",
    "in particular , we see that it remains relatively easy for squarks in the gravitino lsp model set to have masses as low as 400 gev without a near - degeneracy between any of the squarks and the nlsp . however , for very light nlsps we find that the coverage is seen to extend out to somewhat larger squark masses , since in this case the lsp may be excluded through direct production .",

    "we see the results of the jets plus met search for the gravitino model subset wherein the nlsp has a displaced decay that yields observable decay products in addition to the gravitino . while these decays usually have enough met to be visible , the events are often vetoed as a result of displaced jets failing quality requirements or displaced muons triggering the cosmic ray veto . in the upper right panel we see the case which is most similar to the neutralino lsp model set , where the nlsp is either invisible and detector - stable or produces invisible products when it does decay , the situation for which the jets plus met search was designed .",

    "the addition of a 14 tev jets + met channel including leptons or jets with @xmath67-tags would in all probability exclude these few remaining models but such analyses would need to be performed to verify these conclusions . in any case , it is clear from this single analysis that the 14 tev lhc will be able to explore natural mssm spectra in full detail .     above but now for the low - ft model subset as described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   above but now for the low - ft model subset as described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]     above but now for the low - ft model subset as described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   above but now for the low - ft model subset as described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]",
    "the flexibility of the 19/20-parameter pmssm provides a very powerful way to combine , compare and contrast the various searches for susy at the lhc ( and elsewhere ) , even those which employ different collision energies .",
    "here we have examined how the pmssm parameter space is probed by the suite of atlas susy searches by ` replicating ' the searches using fast monte carlo and then determining how these searches impact three distinct pmssm model sets : two large models sets with either a ( @xmath3 ) neutralino or ( @xmath4 ) gravitino lsp and ( @xmath5 ) a smaller specialized neutralino lsp set with low - ft and a thermal lsp saturating the relic density .",
    "we have shown above that the models in these sets generally respond quite differently to the various susy searches . however , in all cases , we see that the combination of results obtained from the many lhc searches can significantly augment the total coverage of the model space . furthermore , not knowing the exact form that the susy spectrum might take _ a priori _ , all of the searches can play important roles in constraining the pmssm model parameters . for models in either the neutralino or low - ft sets",
    ", we also found that the zero - lepton , jets + met search at the 14 tev lhc is very likely to be able to exclude ( or discover ! )",
    "the bulk of models that have survived the 7 and 8 tev searches and do not produce high-@xmath36 leptons in their cascades .",
    "augmenting this single search with others at 14 tev would be of significant interest and something we hope to address in the future .",
