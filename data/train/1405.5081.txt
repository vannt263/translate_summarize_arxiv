    "in the seventies , dobrushin and spitzer , see @xcite and references therein , initiated the idea of obtaining a mathematically precise understanding of the emergence of macroscopic behavior in gases or fluids from the microscopic interaction of a large number of identical particles with stochastic dynamics .",
    "this approach has turned out to be extremely fruitful both in probability theory and statistical physics ( e.g. see the books @xcite ) and it still raises attention nowadays . in this context , recent studies have been made in hydrodynamic limit / fluctuations of interacting particle systems in random / non homogeneous medium , see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "so far , most of the work done in this field concerns the bulk hydrodynamics , i.e. , the derivation of macroscopic partial differential equations arising from the _ bulk interactions _ of the underlying particle system . to this end , one usually considers an infinite system or a finite torus with periodic boundary conditions and then takes the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , in applications to physical systems one is usually confronted with finite systems , which requires the study of a partial differential equation on a finite interval with prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "this raises the question from which microscopic _ boundary interactions _ a given type of boundary condition emerges at the macroscopic scale .",
    "this is an important issue both for boundary - driven open systems , where boundary interactions can induce long - range correlations @xcite and bulk phase transitions due to the absence of particle conservation at the boundaries @xcite , and for bulk - driven conservative systems on the torus where even a single defect bond between two neighboring sites can change bulk relaxation behavior or lead to macroscopic discontinuities in the hydrostatic density profiles .",
    "given such rich behaviour due to boundary effects in non - conservative or bulk - driven systems it is natural to explore the macroscopic role of a microscopic defect on a torus in a conservative system in the _ absence _ of bulk - driving and to ask whether such a defect can be described on macroscopic scale in terms of a boundary condition for the pde describing the bulk hydrodynamics .",
    "in this work we address this problem for the symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) on the discrete torus in the presence of a defect site .",
    "the model can be described as follows .",
    "each site of the discrete torus with @xmath0 sites , that we denote by @xmath6 , is allowed to have at most one particle .",
    "to each site is associated a poisson clock , all of them being independent .",
    "if there is a particle in the associated site , this particle chooses one of its nearest neighbors with equal probability when the clock rings .",
    "if the chosen site is empty , the particle jumps to it",
    ". otherwise nothing happens .",
    "all sites have a poisson clock of parameter two , except the origin , which has a poisson clock of parameter @xmath7 . if @xmath8 , the origin behaves as a _ trap _ , and ( in average ) it keeps a particle there for a longer time than the other sites do .",
    "we call this site a _ slow site_. the main results of the present work are the hydrodynamic limit and the equilibrium fluctuations for the exclusion process with such a slow site .     [ fig:1 ]    specifically , for @xmath2 it is shown here that the limit for the time trajectory of the spatial density of particles is given by the solution of the heat equation with periodic boundary conditions , namely : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the one - dimensional continuous torus .    moreover , considering the same particle system evolving on @xmath11 , we prove that the equilibrium fluctuations of the system are driven by a generalized ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath12 which is the solution of @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a brownian motion on the space @xmath15 of tempered distributions and @xmath16 is the compressibility , which is a coefficient related to the invariant measure of the system .",
    "both results are true irrespective of whether @xmath17 is positive or negative , i.e. , of whether the origin is a fast site or a slow site .    on the other hand , if @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 , the limit for the time trajectory of the spatial density of particles is given by the solution of the heat equation with neumann boundary conditions , namely : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes right and left side limits , respectively .",
    "this represents no passage of particles in the continuum limit .    again considering the same particle system evolving on @xmath11 , we prove that the equilibrium fluctuations of the system when @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 are driven by the solution of @xmath21 which is essentially a version of the previous generalized ornstein - uhlenbeck process associated to the pde , in the same setting of @xcite . these ornstein - uhlenbeck processes are precisely stated in section [ s2 ] .",
    "we point out that a similar model with conservative dynamics on the torus has been considered in @xcite , which consists in the ssep with a _ slow bond _ of intensity @xmath3 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in",
    "that model particles perform nearest - neighbor symmetric random walks , whose jump rate is equal to one at all bonds , except at a particular _ bond _ , where it is equal to @xmath1 . from @xcite",
    "it is known that hydrodynamic limit / fluctuations for exclusion processes with a slow bond have three different behaviors depending on the regime of @xmath24 .    for the ssep with a slow site that we treat here the methods used for the slow bond problem",
    "can not be adapted in any straightforward fashion as the asymmetry at the slow site gives rise to novel difficulties in the study of its hydrodynamic behavior and fluctuations .",
    "the model is reversible , as is the ssep with a slow bond , but it is not _ self - dual , in contrast _ to the ssep with a slow bond .",
    "moreover , the invariant measures for the ssep with a slow site are not translation invariant , as happens for the ssep with a slow bond . as a consequence ,",
    "the proof of the hydrodynamic limit for the ssep with a slow site requires different approaches from the ones of @xcite and one can not naively extend the results obtained for the slow bond to the case of the slow site .",
    "as described above , in this paper we are able to characterize the hydrodynamic limit and the equilibrium fluctuations for @xmath3 when @xmath5 , @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath25 remains open .",
    "however , we present and motivate a conjecture on the behavior of the system in that case . moreover , since we present also the hydrodynamic limit and the equilibrium fluctuations for @xmath1 close to one , namely @xmath2 , the existence of a dynamical phase transition in the behaviour of the system from periodic boundary conditions to neumann boundary conditions at a critical value of @xmath24 in the range @xmath25 is established .    in order to put our results into a broader perspective conservative particle systems with defects we point out that for a single slow bond the ssep treated @xcite exhibits the same hydrodynamic behaviour as non - interacting random walks with a single slow bond . on the other hand , with a single slow site both hydrodynamic limit and fluctuations of non - interacting particles",
    "would be driven by a disconnect behavior for any @xmath26 , leading to dirichlet boundary conditions with boundary densities 0 .",
    "thus the similarity between the ssep and non - interacting particles that one finds for a slow bond breaks down for a slow site , adding further motivation for a detailed investigation of the ssep with a slow site .",
    "it is also worthwhile to compare our result with a result derived in @xcite for a related problem .",
    "the model considered there is called the _ bouchaud _ trap model . in that model ,",
    "particles perform independent random walks in a random environment with traps given by i.i.d . alpha - stable random variables .",
    "in @xcite it was proved that the hydrodynamic limit for such model is given by a generalized partial differential equation depending on an alpha - stable subordinator .",
    "the present paper suggests that a trap model of exclusion type should not have the same limit as obtained in @xcite for a trap model of independent random walks . for the ssep",
    "the asymmetry at the slow site yields a limit that has some properties in common with a slow bond and therefore a behavior completely different from the one observed in @xcite",
    ".    here follows the outline of this paper . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we give notations , precise definitions and statements of the results . in section [ s3 ] we present the hydrodynamic limit of the model . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we present the equilibrium fluctuations ( in infinite volume ) . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we state a conjecture on what should be the complete scenario for exclusion processes with a slow site . in section [ s6 ]",
    "we present an extra result on the hydrodynamic behavior of the ssep with @xmath27 neighboring slow bonds , which we use as an argument to sustain our conjecture in section [ s5 ] .",
    "a particle system can be constructed through its generator or via poisson processes . in this work",
    "we will make use of both .",
    "let @xmath28 be the one - dimensional discrete torus with @xmath0 points .",

    "if the site @xmath41 is occupied and the site @xmath42 is empty , the particle moves from site @xmath41 to site @xmath42 at a time arrival of the poisson process associated to @xmath44 , and analogously for sites @xmath45 .",
