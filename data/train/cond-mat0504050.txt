    "miniaturization of devices is an ever pressing demand . it is also obvious that to sustain miniaturization",
    ", we have to use systems that are so small that the laws of physics is determined by quantum mechanics .",
    "so understanding the properties of so called mesoscopic systems is also very demanding @xcite .",
    "circuits of future devices will be made up of quantum wires .",
    "junctions in such circuits also has to be understood from quantum mechanics .",
    "such a simple junction is what is refered to as a three prong potential @xcite and it is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 . there are several papers that explore the importance of such a junction in a mesoscopic system @xcite .    while bound states are important to understand the thermodynamic properties of a sample @xcite , the scattering states are important to understand the transport properties @xcite .",
    "however , it is not always necessary to solve the bound states and the scattering states separately .",
    "both these states are solutions of the same hamiltonian but with different boundary conditions .",
    "it is possible to solve only the scattering states and thereby also understand the bound states as an analytical continuation of the scattering states . at the heart of this principle",
    "is the friedel sum rule @xcite that states that for non - polarizable leads @xcite @xmath0\\ ] ] the correction terms are small in wkb regime @xcite . here",
    "@xmath1,\\ ] ] @xmath2 is the incident electron energy , @xmath3 is the scattering matrix , @xmath4 is the density of states ( dos ) at energy e in presence of scattering , @xmath5 is dos in absence of scattering .",
    "@xmath6 is refered to as the friedel phase .",
    "the rhs of eq .",
    "1 is therefore related to the integrated charge localized around the scatterer and this can be determined from the @xmath3 matrix .    a number of experiments @xcite",
    "show that the phase of a particular scattering matrix element can be measured .",
    "yeyati and buttiker @xcite first proposed that such phases can be understood from the friedel sum rule ( fsr ) .",
    "it was later found that transmission zeroes play a special role @xcite and change our understanding of the fsr .",
    "normally , in mesoscopic systems , @xmath3 is a large but finite matrix , and often all the matrix elements are not completely independent .",
    "so , it may not be necessary to evaluate all the elements of @xmath3 , in order to calculate @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , in mesoscopic systems , it is possible to measure a particular matrix element of @xmath3 .",
    "one can measure the phase as well as the amplitude of the matrix element @xcite . for a large dimensional @xmath3 matrix",
    ", it may not be possible to measure all the elements of @xmath3 .",
    "so , it is important to know what kind of physical informations can be obtained from the phase of a particular matrix element and which are the important matrix elements .",
    "for example , in case of a one dimension ( 1d ) system , the scattering matrix is 2x2 , and @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the transmission amplitude and @xmath9 \\over re[t]}$ ] .",
    "situation is complicated in quasi-1d where a single transverse mode is populated and the scattering matrix is 2x2 .",
    "this is because of the presence of discontinuous changes in scattering phase shifts at fano resonances @xcite . for such systems",
    "it was shown @xcite @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the fermi energy at which @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath12 occur because of fano resonance and is a general feature of quasi-1d @xcite .",
    "situation is further complicated in multichannel quasi-1d where the dimensionality of @xmath3 matrix is more than 2x2 . in case of a multichannel fano resonance ,",
    "there are sharp continuous phase drops at the minima of certain scattering probabilities , while not so for others @xcite .",
    "for example , in case of the @xmath13 function potential in a multichannel quantum wire , there are sharp drops in @xmath14 versus incident energy , when @xmath15 is minimum .",
    "but , this does not happen for @xmath16 or @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "there it was shown @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is reflection amplitude from @xmath22th transverse channel to @xmath23th transverse channel , @xmath24 is reflection amplitude from @xmath22th transverse channel to @xmath22th transverse channel and @xmath25 is transmission amplitude from @xmath22th transverse channel to @xmath23th transverse channel .",
    "5 also applies to the potentials studied in ref . @xcite but eq .",
    "4 does not apply to the multi channel wire with a @xmath13 function potential .    which means",
    "charge transfer is determined by the energy derivatives of those @xmath26 that do not show a drop . their derivatives are identical to the derivatives of the friedel phase @xmath6 . however , delta function potential , as well as the potentials studied in ref .",
    "@xcite are all point scatterers and it is not known if this feature is general .",
    "this motivates us to study an extended potential that can exhibit multi channel fano resonance .",
    "so in this paper we study the system shown in fig .",
    "1 , as it is an extended potential .",
    "we shall show that it can exhibit multichannel fano resonance .",
    "it is a simple model , that allows analytical understanding and allows us to check if the @xmath3 matrix elements whose phase do not show a negative slope carry the information about the dos .",
    "besides , the potential considered here has certain subtleties .",
    "a different kind of subtlety exists @xcite for a potential in quasi-1d , namely there is an exponentially decaying local density of states ( ldos ) in the leads due to the evanescent modes .",
    "one has to be careful about interpreting what is a non - polarizable lead that normally means that the integrated ldos in the leads are not be considered in ( 1 ) .",
    "but in quasi 1d it is not possible to separate the ldos in the leads and the ldos in the sample .",
    "the exponentially decaying ldos in the leads are to be included in ( 1 ) but the non - decaying ldos in the leads should not be included in ( 1 ) @xcite . as a result , the correction terms to eq .",
    "( 1 ) are negligible in wkb regime is no longer a correct statement @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the subtlety arises with the interpretation of @xmath27 as will be explained in section iv .",
    "consider the geometry , schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 . the thin lines are semi - infinite 1d quantum wires ( that successfully models a quasi 1d quantum wire with a single transverse mode populated ) with quantum mechanical potential @xmath28 , while the thick lines are quantum wires with a potential @xmath29 .",
    "an incident electron is shown by the arrow head and the quantum mechanical wave functions in the different regions i , ii , iii , iv , v and vi are written below .",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are defined in fig .",
    "1 . these wave functions have to be continuous and current has to be conserved at the junctions . from this",
    "we get a set 9 linear equations from which we can solve the 9 unknown coefficients that are @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , we have to solve the scattering problem when the incident electron is from the top , in order to obtain @xmath41 etc .",
    "thus we can determine the scattering matrix .",
    "it is a three channel problem and the scattering matrix is 3x3 as shown below .",
    "@xmath42    it is known that @xcite @xmath43=\\ ] ] @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the retarded green s function and @xmath49 is the integrated local dos in the thick region of fig .",
    "1 . allowed modes in the system are denoted by momentum index @xmath50 and @xmath51 can take three values ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) , corresponding to incident electron from three possible directions . here",
    "@xmath22 is electronic mass and @xmath52 is @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 and so on . here",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57\\ ] ] that is @xmath58 is calculated with the incident electron from the left .",
    "@xmath59 is calculated with the incident electron from the top . and @xmath60 is calculated with the incident electron from the right .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "13 in eq . 1 and considering the mesoscopic leads to be unpolarizable ( which means the last 3 terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "13 are to be ignored .",
    "actually even if one does not want to invoke the non - polarizability of the leads , one can evaluate those indefinite integrals and see that these terms are negligibly small in the regime of interest , which is the wkb regime .",
    "this is the regime where transport occurs ) we get @xmath61\\ ] ]",
    "in case of the three prong potential , it is not possible to realize the state of  absence of scattering \" . even if we make the potential @xmath63 in fig .",
    "1 , equal to 0 , we get @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 . even for unequal @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
    "there is always some reflection and scattering , in absence of the potential .",
    "this is often encountered in case of scattering by topological defects where there is no continuous way of going to the defect free regime .",
    "so first we have to eliminate @xmath62 , i.e. , the dos in absence of scattering .",
    "this is dealt with in this section .",
    "one can say that when @xmath28 , then @xmath67\\ ] ] here , @xmath68 stands for the thick region in fig .",
    "i with @xmath63 set to 0 .",
    "@xmath69 is calculated from the @xmath3 matrix when @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath70 is the dos of the unknown system , that is the defect free version of the scattering system being studied .",
    "@xmath28 situation yields a @xmath3 matrix given below .",
    "@xmath71 from this it can be proved that @xmath72 ) = { 2l_1 \\over hv } + { 2l_2 \\over hv } + { 2l_3 \\over hv } \\approx \\rho^{(w')}(e)\\ ] ] similarly , when @xmath73 , @xmath74\\ ] ] from 17 and 20 , we find that @xmath75\\ ] ] thus using 19 we get @xmath76 or @xmath77 with the choice of wavefunctions in ( 6 ) - ( 11 ) , this is also what we get for potential scattering .",
    "this is because the s - matrix elements of the three prong potential for @xmath78 , does not have any non - trivial energy dependence ( energy dependence is same as that of a free particle ) . but",
    "this method of elimination can be applied to complicated junctions where we will get situations not encountered with potential scattering .",
    "we first show that the three prong potential can exhibit multichannel fano resonance . in fig .",
    "2 , we show that @xmath79 drops sharply when @xmath80 minimizes . in fig .",
    "3 , we show that @xmath81 drops sharply when @xmath82 minimizes .",
    "these are typical signatures of fano resonances @xcite .",
    "these phase drops can be sharper than any scale present in the system as shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "these phase shifts can be detected experimentally and it is important to investigate the physical informations that can be obtained from such phase shifts . in the following we will show that @xmath83 does not show any drop and also calculate the dos explicitly to check if dos or friedel phase is related to @xmath83 .",
    "our previous experience , as discussed in section ii , suggests that this could be the case .    in fig .",
    "4 , we plot @xmath84 as a function of @xmath85 . it shows sharp peaks and is positive everywhere , implying that unlike in @xmath79 or @xmath81 , there are no drops or negative slopes in @xmath83 . also @xmath84 is very close to @xmath86 and @xmath87 . here",
    "@xmath51 is taken to be the unit of length .",
    "however , unlike the case of the @xmath13 function potential in q1d , @xmath84 is not identical to @xmath86 .",
    "they are indeed very close to each other and identical for practical purposes when the fano resonances are long lived . however , for fano resonances with short life times , there are quantitative differences , although there is qualitative similarity , as shown in fig . 5 .",
    "fano resonances occur very frequently in mesoscopic systems .",
    "not much is known about scattering phase shifts for fano resonances .",
    "we show that the three prong potential is a simple model that gives multichannel fano resonance .",
    "unlike , previously studied potentials that show fano resonances , this is an extended potential . in case of fano resonances , scattering phase shifts in only some particular channels",
    "show sharp phase drops while others do not .",
    "the channels that do not show the phase drops seem to be the more informative channels and hence very special channels .",
    "it seems that dos is related to the scattering phase shifts of these special channels . as , this is exact for point scatterers , we were tempted to check it for an extended scatterer that exhibit fano resonance .",
    "the three prong potential studied shows that this is true when the fano resonances are long lived .",
    "in all the experiments so far @xcite one has encountered long lived fano resonances where the phase drops are very sharp . as the life time of the resonances",
    "decrease , the energy derivative of the scattering phase shifts in these special channels and integrated charge inside the scatterer start deviating from each other .",
    "however , they are qualitatively similar .",
    "the phase shift in the channels that exhibit the phase drops do not give any information about the dos , qualitatively or quantitatively , for long lived resonances or short lived resonances .",
    "so far , experiments @xcite and theories @xcite mostly focused on the phase shifts of these non - informative channels .",
    "we hope that this will give some clues to future works to find a mathematical proof of this fact .",
    "such a proof should be consistent with the features observed in the three prong potential and in the @xmath13 function potential in a quantum wire .",
