    "the observed elemental abundances of metal - poor stars can be used to constrain the physics of supernovae ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "although the nature of the first stars is not well understood , if they explode as supernovae the first chemical enrichment is imprinted in the elemental abundances of the second generation of stars . during the early stages of galaxy formation ,",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is highly inhomogeneous , and it is likely that these elemental abundance patterns are determined only by a few supernovae @xcite . in the inhomogeneous enrichment , metallicity is not a time indicator anymore but merely reflects the metallicity of the cloud in which the second generation of stars formed .",
    "this metallicity is often estimated with an analytic formula @xcite , but detailed hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooing are necessary to predict the metallicity distribution function of the second generation of stars .",
    "alternatively , we assume that metal poor stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 are enriched by a single supernova , and study the properties of the supernova by comparing observed elemental abundances and nucleosynthesis yields ( abundance profiling / fitting ) .",
    "thanks to large scale surveys and follow - up high resolution spectroscopy , intensive observations of metal - poor stars have revealed the existence of extremely- , ultra- , and hyper- metal - poor ( emp , ump , and hmp ) stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the elemental abundance patterns have a distinct signature : including two hmp stars , @xmath4% of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath5 show carbon enhancement relative to iron ( [ c / fe ] @xmath6 , @xcite ) .",
    "such carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars often show enhancement of @xmath0 elements ( o , mg , si , s , and ca ) , although one star at [ fe / h]@xmath7 does not show enhancement of c , n , and mg @xcite .",
    "there are various scenarios to explain the carbon enhancement , including rotating massive stars @xcite , asymptotic giant branch stars in binary systems @xcite , and black - hole - forming core - collapse supernovae ( faint supernovae ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite recently presented different types of emp stars that show lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios with / without carbon enhancement than other emp stars .",
    "the variation of [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios of emp stars has been known . as",
    "the quality of data improved , @xcite concluded that without cemp , the scatter of elemental abundances is so small that the ism is well mixed at the early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "however , a significant scatter is seen in other observational data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a small fraction of stars show lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios than @xmath8 0.2 .    an intrinsic variation of [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios can be caused from the following enrichment sources : ( i ) the most popular source is type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , which produce more fe than @xmath0 elements .",
    "depending on the fractional contribution of core - collapse supernovae from previous populations , [ @xmath0/fe ] can vary between @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "however , there is a time - delay of the enrichment in the case of sne ia , which depends on the progenitor systems @xcite , and is @xmath11 myr at the shortest for @xmath12 primary stars .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that many emp stars are affected by sne ia .",
    "( ii ) @xmath13 supernovae have a smaller mantle mass that contains @xmath0 elements than more massive stars , and thus give lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios than the initial mass function ( imf ) weighted values of core - collapse supernova yields , i.e. , the plateau values of [ @xmath0/fe]-[fe / h ] relations @xcite .",
    "these supernovae will leave a neutron star behind , and should be very common for the standard imf weighted for the low - mass end ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "( iii ) hypernovae ( @xmath14 for @xmath15 ) are observationally known to produce more iron than normal supernovae ( @xmath16 for @xmath17 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , hypernovae can give lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios than supernovae at a given progenitor mass .",
    "the hypernova rate is not very high at present , but can be high for low - metallicity stars because of small angular momentum loss .",
    "( iv ) faint supernovae are proposed to explain the elemental abundance patterns of cemp stars from carbon to zinc .",
    "the central parts of supernova ejecta that contain most of iron fall back onto the black hole , while the stellar envelopes that contain carbon are ejected as in normal supernovae .",
    "therefore , the [ c / fe ] ratio of faint supernovae is as large as that of cemp stars . among @xmath0 elements , o and",
    "mg are synthesized during hydrostatic burning and located in the outskirts of ejecta .",
    "therefore , faint supernovae often have high [ ( o , mg)/fe ] ratios , depending on mixing - fallback processes .",
    "the faint supernovae scenario is also the best explanation of the observed carbon - enhanced damped lyman @xmath0 ( dla ) system @xcite .",
    "( v ) primordial stars with initial masses of @xmath18 enter into the electron - positron pair - instability region during the central oxygen - burning stages , where most of o and mg are transformed into si , s , and fe .",
    "pair - instability supernovae produce a much larger amount of iron and higher [ ( si , s)/(o , mg ) ] ratios than core - collapse supernovae .",

    "we adopt progenitor star models from @xcite for @xmath19 and @xmath20 with the same modification of the number of electrons per nucleon , @xmath21 , as in @xcite . during the supernova explosion , the elements synthesized in different stellar layers should mix to some extent , and some fraction of this mixed material falls back onto the remnant .",
    "we calculate nucleosynthesis yields by using mixing - fallback models @xcite for supernovae and hypernovae .",
    "the mass - energy relation is taken from the results of light curve fitting @xcite ; @xmath22 for @xmath23 supernovae , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath20 hypernovae , respectively .",
    "we then perform the parameter search for three dimensional spaces of the inner boundary of mixing @xmath27 ( i.e. mass cut ) , the outer boundary of mixing @xmath28 , and the ejection fraction of the mixing region @xmath29 .",
    "the minimum , maximum , steplength for each parameter are : @xmath30 [ iron core mass , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 [ @xmath27 , min(co core mass , @xmath34 ) , @xmath32 , and @xmath35 $ ] .",

    "we search acceptable models using the chi - squared test statistic , and the parameters of favoured models that have least @xmath37 for given @xmath38 and @xmath39 are listed in table 1 .",
    "acceptable models have parameters around the peaks and give similar @xmath37 values .",
    "for the three stars in @xcite , the observational constraints are [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , and [ ca i / fe ] , and detection or non - detection of [ c / fe ] . provided signal - to - noise ratio , temperature , and gravity of the two stars with no carbon detection , we estimate that [ c / fe ] ratios should be lower than @xmath40 from spectral synthesis , and apply this constraint .",
    "it is the iron peak elements that give a much stronger constraint on model parameters , but there are no observational estimates available for these stars .",

    "this relative difference in [ co / fe ] among models will remain , although the absolute amounts of co yields should be increased with multi - dimensional explosions with the neutrino process .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 supernova models are strongly disfavored from the observed co abundances . among four non - cemp stars ,",
    "he1416 - 1032 and he2357 - 0701 show some nitrogen enhancement with ( [ n / fe ] , [ n / c])=(0.37 , @xmath76 ) and ( 0.87 , 0.61 ) , respectively .",
    "this nitrogen enhancement could be explained with faint supernova / hypernova models .",
    "we should note , however , that the c and n abundances may be affected by internal mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the variation of [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios of emp stars has been known .",
    "@xcite commented that some anomalous stars that have low [ @xmath0/fe ] at [ fe / h ] @xmath80 can be explained not by sne ia but by @xmath43 core - collapse supernovae .",
    "@xcite showed that the predicted [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios have a too large scatter in stochastic models of chemical evolution with the yields from @xcite . in the updated yields of @xcite",
    ", the ejected iron mass @xmath46 was constrained from the observations of supernovae @xcite . as a result",
    ", @xmath46 was decreased in low - mass supernovae and increased in high - mass supernovae .",

    "in chemodynamical simulations with the updated yields , the scatter of [ @xmath0/fe ] is comparable to observations ( fig .",
    "13 of @xcite ) .",
    "the mixing - fallback effect is naturally expected in the case of hypernovae , which are jet - induced explosions followed by black hole formation @xcite . in hypernovae ,",
    "large fallback is possible even for such energetic explosions as @xmath81 if the timescale of jet - injection is long @xcite . in supernovae , it is also possible that some degree of mixing occurs through rayleigh - taylor instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that more massive supernovae tend to undergo less extended rayleigh - taylor mixing ( i.e. , smaller @xmath28 ) because of the smaller deceleration of the expanding core due to smoother density structures .",
    "the origin of cemp - low-@xmath0 is interesting .",
    "if there is a cemp - low-@xmath0 star with [ zn / fe ] @xmath8 [ co / fe ] @xmath53 , that would require a new population , i.e. , @xmath82 faint supernovae that form black holes . for @xmath83 stars , they are believed to form neutron stars , and thus black - hole forming faint supernovae have not been discussed in previous works .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath82 supernovae are not rare . because of the smaller ejection mass than that of more massive stars , the contribution from @xmath82 supernovae can appear at various metallicities in the system where chemical enrichment took place inhomogeneously .",
    "one example may be dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) .",
    "it is known that stars in dsphs show lower [ @xmath0/fe ] than the stars in the solar neighborhood at a given metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and some emp stars in dsphs also show low [ @xmath0/fe ] @xcite .",
    "this is sometimes explained by the contribution from sne ia with a longer timescale of star formation ( if the sn ia lifetimes do not depend on the progenitor metallicity ) .",
    "however , the elemental abundance patterns , in particular the [ mn / fe ] ratios as low as halo stars @xcite , are not consistent with the enrichment from sne ia . in small systems such as dsphs , it is likely that the star formation efficiency is low and thus the sampling of massive stars is incomplete , which results in the missing contribution from massive stars at @xmath84 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . in the milky way galaxy , similar abundance patterns was reported by @xcite , which tend to be accreted halo stars from their kinematics .",
    "@xcite also showed that stars with the galactic outer halo kinematics tend to have low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios .",
    "for such an accretion component , incomplete sampling of massive stars is possible , although the metallicity is higher than that of emp stars .",
    "the abundance patterns of these stars are also consistent with our @xmath1 supernova models .",
    "abundance fitting is a new approach to study the properties of supernovae .",
    "statistical studies with a large homogeneous sample will be able to answer the following questions : what is the major source of chemical enrichment in the early universe ?",
    "namely , what were the distribution functions of progenitor mass , ejected iron mass , and explosion energy of supernovae ?",
    "are the mass - energy and mass - iron mass relations of nearby supernovae reproduced ?",
    "what is the mass function of the remnants of the first stars ?",
    "in the early stages of chemical enrichment , the interstellar medium is supposed to be highly inhomogeneous , so that the properties of the first supernovae can be directly extracted from the comparison between the observed elemental abundances and nucleosynthesis yields .",
    "we show that the low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios recently found for a small fraction of extremely metal - poor stars can be naturally explained with the nucleosynthesis yields of core - collapse supernovae , i.e. , ( 1 ) @xmath1 supernovae , or ( 2 ) hypernovae . if we allow an enhanced mixing and a large fallback , @xmath20 supernova models ( 3 ) could be consistent with the observed low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios . for the case without carbon enhancement ,",
    "the ejected iron masses of these favored models ( 1 - 3 ) are normal , @xmath48 for supernovae and @xmath85 for hypernovae , consistent with observed light curves and spectra of nearby supernovae .",
    "the first source ( 1 ) has been included in the standard set of nucleosynthesis yields that have been applied to galactic chemical evolution models , while the other sources are different from those in galactic chemical evolution models and rarer .",
    "on the other hand , the carbon enhancement requires much smaller iron production , and the low [ @xmath0/fe ] of carbon enhanced metal - poor stars can also be reproduced with faint supernovae or faint hypernovae .",
    "the ejected iron mass is @xmath86 , much smaller than normal supernovae .",
    "these enrichment sources are similar to those proposed for typical carbon - enhanced emp stars and dlas with [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath87 , but the progenitor mass is as low as @xmath88 , or more extended mixing and larger fallback occur in @xmath45 stars .",
    "the former case implies that @xmath89 stars may form black holes .",
