    "blazar  type active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are characterized by a luminous and rapidly variable spectral energy distribution ( sed ) extending from radio up to gev and tev energies @xcite .",
    "the blazar sed is characterized by two components .",
    "the first one peaks at ir to x - ray energies and it is most probably synchrotron radiation from electrons in a relativistic jet pointing close to the line of sight .",
    "the second one peaks at gev - tev energies and , according to leptonic models ( for a recent review see bttcher 1999 ) , is inverse compton ( ic ) emission from the same electron population , synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) scattering in the case of synchrotron seed photons and external compton ( ec ) scattering in the case of external seed photons .",
    "unified schemes attempt to understand the properties of blazar samples using physical models coupled to scaling and/or geometrical arguments .",
    "one of the first unification problems was the differences between two types of bl lacertae objects ( bls , blazars with weak broad emission lines ) , the high peak frequency bls ( hbls ) and the low peak frequency bls ( lbls ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that these differences could be explained assuming that the jet flow is accelerating and that lbls form a smaller angle between the jet axis and line of sight than hbls .",
    "@xcite argued that the range of observed properties in blazars can not be reproduced solely under the different orientation hypothesis , and that physical changes need to be invoked to explain the gradual change of observed properties going from flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) to lbls to hbls .",
    "the gap between hbls and lbls was filled with the discovery @xcite of the intermediate bls ( ibls ) , sources with peak frequencies at optical - uv energies and with properties intermediate between those of hlbs and lbls .",
    "@xcite proposed a unification scheme for bls based on two parameters , the intrinsic luminosity of the source and the orientation of the jet relative to the observer .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out a sequence of blazar properties as a function of source power .",
    "as the source power increases , the emission line luminosity and the ratio of compton to synchrotron luminosity are increasing , while the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 and the ic peak frequency decrease .",
    "recent multiwavelength studies support this scheme ( e.g. @xcite ) . under this scheme",
    ", sources with strong emission lines should have low @xmath0 and ic  dominated flat x - ray spectra , and sources with high @xmath0 should be lineless and have steep x - ray spectra dominated by the high energy tail of the synchrotron emission .",
    "recent observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) revealed a population of high energy peaked fsrqs , dubbed blue quasars ( bqs ) , with properties that challenge the above scheme .",
    "these are sources with _",
    "( 0.12.4 kev ) spectra steeper than those of fsrqs , similar to those of hbls . at the same time they exhibit strong emission lines and ,",
    "those observed with _ asca _ ( sambruna et al . 2000 ) , flat hard x  ray ( 210 kev ) spectra similar to classical fsrqs .",
    "sambruna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) presented seds and _ asca _ observations of 4 bqs .",
    "as they note , these sources are peaking at optical ",
    "uv energies ( although with the current data the location of the sed peak is still somewhat uncertain ) , and it is not clear if the optical to uv emission is synchrotron as in bls or if it has a thermal emission component as in sources like 3c 273 .",
    "they also point out that while these bqs have similar seds and @xmath1 spectral indices ( @xmath2 ) to ibls , they have much stronger broad emission lines . in this work",
    "we address the unusual properties of bqs and their implications on blazar unification .",
    "in table [ tbl1 ] we present published data for the 4 bqs of sambruna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and for two ibls with sufficient observations , which we use for comparison purposes : source name , source type , ratio @xmath3 of the extended ( nonbeamed ) to core ( beamed ) radio power , which is a measure of the alignment between the jet axis and the line of sight , extended radio power @xmath4 , and broad line region ( blr ) power @xmath5 .",
    "the smaller @xmath3 and the higher @xmath4 and @xmath5 of bqs indicate that bqs are more powerful and less aligned that ibls .",
    "additional evidence for the relative misalignment of 0923 + 392 @xcite and 0405 - 123 @xcite comes from the fr ii like radio morphology of these sources . given the relative misalignment of bqs",
    "we ask how the sed of the aligned version of these sources looks , and how these aligned sources compare with sources found in current blazar samples .",
    "we examine both cases for the optical  uv flux being only synchrotron or having an additional thermal contribution from an accretion disc .",
    "we use the jet formalism of @xcite , modified to include ic losses due to an external photon field and an angle dependent emission for both a constant lorentz factor and an accelerating jet @xcite . in this work",
    "the ic emission is not modeled .",
    "modeling the hard x - ray emission , which is probably due to ssc @xcite , is highly complicated for the inhomogeneous jets studied here .",
    "although we can not address the hard x - ray emission quantitatively , we can discuss qualitatively the scaling of the observed hard x - ray flux of the bqs as a function of beaming , since the beaming behavior of the ic component is well understood @xcite .",
    "we study first a constant lorentz factor @xmath6 jet together with a thermal component modeled as black body ( bb ) radiation . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we plot the sed for a range of angles @xmath7 between the jet axis and the line of sight . the jet emission is strongly affected by doppler boosting and , as @xmath7 decreases , the non  thermal sed shifts mostly upward to higher apparent luminosities with a slight shift to higher peak frequencies , since @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the spectral index , @xmath11 is the usual doppler factor @xmath12 , and the subscript @xmath13 refers to quantities in the flow comoving frame . since the bb and the blr emission",
    "are not a function of @xmath7 , the relative contribution of the thermal component and the equivalent width ( ew ) of the emission lines ( which are not plotted here , but are assumed to have a fraction of the bb luminosity ) are reduced as @xmath7 decreases .",
    "we expect the ic _ asca _ component to either follow the increase of the synchrotron one if it is due to ssc emission or to increase even faster if it is due to ec emission , since @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite . in both cases , and",
    "depending on @xmath5 , the aligned source will look like an lbl or a classical fsrq , possibly similar to 3c 279 , a source showing evidence of a thermal component in its optical  uv spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that for 3c 279 , @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 @xcite , in the @xmath5 range of the bqs examined here .",
    "we study now the case of an accelerating jet .",
    "higher frequencies emerge closer to the base of the jet , are characterized by lower @xmath6 , and are therefore less sensitive to angle variations compared to the lower frequencies @xcite . as can be seen from the solid lines in figure [ fig2 ] , as @xmath7 decreases , the non  thermal sed shifts upward to higher apparent luminosities , but this time with a large shift to lower @xmath0 , since the higher @xmath6 of the low  frequency emitting plasma results to a larger increase in the low  frequency boosting .",
    "the relative contribution of the thermal component and the ew of the emission lines drop as the source becomes more aligned , although this is more gradual compared to the apparent luminosity and @xmath0 changes observed due to the frequency  dependent doppler boosting .",
    "the ic _ asca _ component must be mostly due to the same plasma responsible for the sub - mm  ir emission , and is characterized by a @xmath6 higher than the @xmath6 of the x  ray emitting plasma .",
    "therefore , as the source becomes more aligned , the ic component will progressively dominate over the synchrotron at lower frequencies .",
    "qualitatively , the aligned population in this case is similar to the one predicted for a constant @xmath6 jet .",
    "a discriminator between the two cases could be the detailed form of the sed for low @xmath3 ( more misaligned ) objects .",
    "one would expect the synchrotron and the bb peak frequencies of the sed to be further apart in the constant @xmath6 case , since in this case the synchrotron peak frequency has to be @xmath18 hz , close to the synchrotron peak frequency of classical fsrqs and lbls , and the bb peak frequency @xmath19 hz .",
    "we now assume that the observed sed of the bqs , with a peak at @xmath20 , is synchrotron radiation with no significant thermal contribution .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig3 ] , aligning a constant @xmath6 jet will boost up the apparent luminosity and will slightly increase @xmath0 .",
    "the ew of the emission lines ( which are still assumed to be powered by an accretion disc ) will be reduced , but the ic component will be boosted either as much as the synchrotron component ( ssc case ) or more ( ec case ) . in both cases",
    "the aligned sources will be bright sources with @xmath21 , low ew emission lines , and a spectral flattening between _ rosat _ and _ asca _ energies , due to ic emission . such high luminosity , high peak frequency sources , with hard x  ray ic spectra flatter than the synchrotron soft x  ray spectra have not been observed , and there is no obvious selection effect acting against detecting them . if such sources existed they would have been observed in x  ray selected bl samples .",
    "therefore , the possibility of pure synchrotron emission and constant @xmath6 jets is excluded for bqs .",
    "the case of a synchrotron sed for an accelerating flow ( figure [ fig2 ] , broken line ) is quite similar to the accelerating flow with the bb contribution and it is practically impossible to discriminate between the two without a detailed knowledge of the sed at optical  uv energies .",
    "a question pointed out by sambruna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is how can objects with similar seds like bqs and ibls have so different emission line properties .",
    "the higher value of @xmath3 and the smaller @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the ibls we present in table [ tbl1 ] show that these are less powerful sources seen under a smaller angle .",
    "we can qualitatively transform a bq to an ibl with two translations , one in angle and one in intrinsic power : first align the bq , then decrease its intrinsic power .",
    "the source resulting from the first translation will have smaller ew emission lines , since decreasing @xmath7 boosts the synchrotron component , but it will be more luminous than an ibl",
    ". the second step will reduce the luminosity of the source down to the ibl luminosity .",
    "the similar peak frequencies hold an interesting clue to the acceleration and cooling processes : since the aligned bq will have @xmath22 hz regardless of an accelerating or constant velocity jet , the decrease of the intrinsic power must increase @xmath0 to typical values for ibls ( @xmath23 hz ) .",
    "this means that cooling becomes less efficient and/or particles are accelerated to higher energies as the intrinsic power of the source is reduced , something that has been previously argued by @xcite .",
    "we now focus on the _ asca _ x  ray emission .",
    "although the _ asca _ spectra of all the sources presented in table [ tbl1 ] are flat ( @xmath2 ) , they differ in the following sense : while in the ibls the hard x - ray luminosity is @xmath24 times weaker than the peak luminosity of the first spectral component @xcite , in the bqs this is at most 10 times weaker .",
    "given now the difference in @xmath7 , if one was to align the bqs , this difference would either persist or would become even more pronounced .",
    "this is because the hard x - ray emission is either ssc ( @xmath25 ) or ec ( @xmath15 ) emission , while the apparent luminosity of the first component will at most increase as @xmath26 if it is pure synchrotron emission with no contribution from a thermal component .",
    "if this difference in the hard x - ray luminosity relative level is also present in the peak ic luminosities , then the ratio of the photon to magnetic field energy density experienced by the emitting particles is higher in high power sources .",
    "unfortunately , there are no _ egret _ detections of the bqs , although the two ibls we compare them with have been detected with an ic luminosity practically equal to that of the synchrotron component @xcite .",
    "bqs seem to be relatively misaligned blazars with a relatively de - boosted synchrotron continuum .",
    "it is not clear if there is a thermal component in the optical  uv spectrum of the bqs ( sambruna et al .",
    "if there is , one can distinguish between an accelerating and constant @xmath6 flow depending on the peak frequency @xmath0 of the synchrotron component .",
    "if @xmath27 hz , then the flow is most probably characterized by a single lorentz factor . otherwise , if @xmath0 is close to the peak of the thermal component , the flow is most probably accelerating . in both cases",
    "the aligned sources will be lbls or fsrqs , possibly similar to 3c 279 .",
    "on the other hand , if no significant thermal component can be detected in bqs , the possibility of a constant @xmath6 jet is excluded , since the aligned version would be a source similar to a bright hbl , but with a strong and flat ic hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "such sources are not observed , and there are no obvious selection criteria against their detection .",
    "clarification therefore of the nature of the sed can provide valuable insight on the flow characteristics .",
    "orientation aside , sources of different intrinsic power are different .",
    "the synchrotron frequency @xmath0 is lower for higher power sources .",
    "this suggests that cooling is stronger in high power sources .",
    "in addition , the relative level of the hard x - ray ic luminosity hints that the ratio of the comoving photon to magnetic field energy density is higher in high power sources . measurements of the ic peak luminosity are needed though to check if this is really the case .",
    "the fact that cooling is not invariant under an increase of the intrinsic power suggests that powerful sources are not simply scaled up versions of weak sources .",
    "since both the orientation and the intrinsic power strongly affect the observed characteristics of a source , we are naturally led to a two - dimensional unification scheme for blazars . in this scheme , the bqs observed by sambruna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) appear to be intrinsically powerful sources , whose jet angle to the line of sight is relatively larger than that of typical blazars ."
