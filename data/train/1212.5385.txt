    "dynamical systems are known to undergo sudden regime shifts at critical parameter values , termed the bifurcation points , with the different regimes defined by distinct sets of attractors of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , a large number of studies have been devoted to the investigation of regime shifts in complex dynamical systems and processes ranging from ecosystems , climate change , population collapse and financial markets @xcite to epileptic seizures and asthma attacks @xcite .",
    "examples of sudden regime shifts include the collapse of vegetation under semi - arid conditions , the transition from a clear to a turbid lake , catastrophic shifts in fish or wildlife populations @xcite , transitions from one stable gene expression state to another in natural and synthetic genetic circuits @xcite and the sudden deterioration of complex diseases @xcite .",
    "the regime shifts , in most of the cases studied , are brought about by abrupt transitions from bistability to monostability via the saddle - node bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the state of a dynamical system at a specific time @xmath0 is defined in terms of the magnitudes of one or more key variables at time @xmath0 . in the steady state ,",
    "the rates of change in the magnitudes of the variables are zero . in the case of monostability , there is only one single stable steady state .",
    "the region of bistability is distinguished by the coexistence of two stable steady states separated by an unstable steady state .",
    "the two stable steady states correspond to low and high values of the variable , designated as the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states respectively .",
    "the bistable region separates two regions of monostability with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states being the respective stable steady states . at a saddle node bifurcation point ,",
    "one of the stable steady states merges with the unstable steady state leading to a reduction in the number of physical solutions , from three to one , beyond the bifurcation point .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the saddle - node bifurcation in the case of the may model @xcite , a well - known model in ecology . in the original model ,",
    "a population of herbivores at a constant density is considered , the population being sustained by vegetation of biomass @xmath3 .",
    "the rate equation describing the changes in the biomass amount is given by @xmath4        the first term on the right hand side represents the logistic growth of the biomass at the rate @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the carrying capacity with the growth rate becoming zero when @xmath7 .",
    "the second term corresponds to the rate of loss of the biomass due to its consumption by the herbivores .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is the maximum loss rate of the biomass or equivalently the maximum grazing rate .",
    "the loss rate saturates when @xmath3 is much larger than a characteristic value @xmath9 .",
    "the may model has been applied to various other ecological problems , e.g. , the exploitation of fish populations @xcite , dynamics of spruce budworms @xcite and harvesting of macrophytes @xcite . figure [ fig1 ] shows the steady state values of the biomass @xmath3 @xmath10 versus the maximum grazing rate parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the other parameter values are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in appropriate units .",
    "the solid lines represent the stable steady states separated by a branch ( dot - dashed line ) of unstable steady states .",
    "the parameters chosen fall in a region of parameter space exhibiting bistability .",
    "the lower @xmath14 and upper @xmath15 bifurcation points separate a region of bistability from two regions of monostability . at the upper bifurcation point @xmath16 , a saddle node bifurcation takes place and there is an abrupt regime shift from the @xmath2 ( high value of biomass ) to the @xmath1 ( low value of biomass ) state .",
    "the transition to the collapsed biomass state is not reversible with the reverse transition from the @xmath1 to the @xmath2 state occurring at the lower bifurcation point @xmath17 .",
    "this is the phenomenon of hysteresis , a characteristic feature of regime shifts of the type shown in figure [ fig1 ] . at @xmath17 ,",
    "a saddle node bifurcation occurs with the @xmath1 state losing stability .        in the case of deterministic time evolution of a dynamical system , there are two ways in which regime shifts occur : _ (",
    "i ) _ at the bifurcation points and _ ( ii ) _ on applying large perturbations in the region of bistability . the unstable steady state sets a threshold for switching transitions between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states .",
    "consider the system to be initially in the @xmath2 state .",
    "a sufficiently large perturbation reduces the magnitude of the dynamical variable below the threshold , thereby bringing about a transition to the @xmath1 state .",
    "another way of bringing about regime shifts is through noise - induced transitions @xcite .",
    "the time evolution in complex dynamical systems exhibiting regime shifts is , in general , stochastic in nature @xcite due to the probabilistic nature of the processes associated with the dynamics .",
    "stochasticity gives rise to fluctuations in the magnitude of the dynamical variable ( say , the biomass ) which , if sufficiently strong , cause transitions between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states away from the bifurcation points .",
    "the occasional switch to an alternative regime in the presence of stochasticity is known as flickering ",
    "@xcite and is responsible for the appearance of a bimodal steady state probability distribution in the region of bistability  .",
    "noise - induced excursions from the stable steady states result in a broadening of the distribution around the steady states .",
    "the steady state distribution is achieved when the probability of the @xmath2 to the @xmath1 state transition is the same as that of the reverse transition .",
    "the bifurcation theory of stochastic dynamical systems is not as well - formulated as that in the case of deterministic dynamics .",
    "kepler and elston @xcite have defined stochastic bifurcation in terms of the number of critical ( singular ) points in the steady state probability density function .",
    "@xcite have investigated the stochastic bifurcation structure of cellular networks through specifying four quantities as a function of the bifurcation parameter : _ (",
    "i ) _ the number of distinct subpopulations ( or peaks in the steady state probability distributions ) , _ ( ii ) _ the locations of the peaks in terms of the measurable variable @xmath3 , _ ( iii ) _ the variability in @xmath3 for each subpopulation and _ ( iv ) _ the fractions of the whole population represented by the subpopulations . the total probability distribution is expressed as a mixture of component distributions , one for each subpopulation .",
    "the term subpopulation is used in a generalized sense , the number of subpopulations being equal to the number of distinct peaks in the probability distribution .",
    "for example , in the region of bistability ( figure [ fig1 ] ) , one has two subpopulations , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the corresponding probability distributions arise due to noise - induced broadening of the steady state levels .",
    "guttal and jayaprakash @xcite have investigated the impact of noise on bistable ecological systems .",
    "they have shown that the region of bistability is diminished in the presence of small amounts of noise whereas for noise beyond a critical strength , bistability vanishes altogether . in the latter case , the dynamical system can undergo abrupt regime shifts frequently . in general",
    ", however , noise can induce new types of dynamic behaviour with significant differences from the deterministic dynamics @xcite . to give a few examples , samoilov et .",
    "@xcite have shown that for the enzymatic futile cycle , a common biomolecular network motif , external noise can generate dynamic bistability through stochastic switchings .",
    "zakharova et .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that noise can enhance the region of bistability , characterized by a bimodal probability distribution between a steady state and a limit cycle , beyond the bistable region obtained in the deterministic case . in the case of a model based on autoactivating gene expression , karmakar and bose @xcite",
    "have shown that noise - induced bistability is possible in a region of parameter space for which there is no bistability in the deterministic case . to and",
    "maheshri @xcite have illustrated this concept in a recent experiment . in this paper , we propose a new framework for the quantitative characterization of noise - induced regime shifts in bistable systems .",
    "the methodology has a clear physical interpretation and is easy to implement .",
    "we focus on two models to illustrate the methodology , the may model and the genetic toggle @xcite describing a simple genetic circuit in which the protein products of two genes repress each other s synthesis .",
    "the may model is a one - variable model whereas the genetic toggle is a two - variable one , thus demonstrating the general applicability of the methodology proposed in the paper . in section [ equipartition ]",
    ", we introduce the concept of the propensity transition point ( ptp ) which may be considered as an indicator of stochastic regime shifts . as an example",
    ", we consider the one - variable may model for which the steady state probability distribution is obtained by solving the appropriate fokker - planck equation . in section [ gillespie ] , the steady - state probability distributions are obtained for both the may model and the genetic toggle using the gillespie simulation algorithm @xcite .",
    "we further analyze available experimental data to determine the ptp in the case of stochastic regime shifts from the normal to the persister subpopulation in mycobacteria subjected to stress in the form of nutrient depletion @xcite .",
    "in the case of stochastic dynamics , the probability distribution @xmath18 of a random variable @xmath3 can be determined using a number of analytical and numerical methods @xcite .",

    "there is recent experimental evidence that microorganisms take recourse to noise - induced regime shifts as a strategy for survival under stress @xcite . in the case of mycobacteria , stresses like nutrient depletion activate the stringent response pathway involving the two component system mprab , the sigma factor sige and the stringent response regulator rel .",

    "multiple positive feedback loops and molecular sequestration of the sigma factor @xcite create the potential for bistability , i.e. , alternative attractor states .",
    "stochastic gene expression gives rise to fluctuations in the levels of key regulatory proteins like rel which , if sufficiently strong , can bring about regime shifts from one attractor state ( low rel level ) to another ( high rel level ) .",
    "the total mycobacterial population divides into two distinct subpopulations @xmath1 and @xmath2 corresponding to low and high rel levels respectively .",

    "m.tuberculosis_ , the pathogen responsible for tubercular infection .",
    "the existence of persisters acts against the total eradication of the tubercular infection .",
    "the major goal of an effective drug treatment is to eliminate the population of persisters . in this context , it is of interest to identify the ptp above which the subpopulation of persisters becomes the dominant subpopulation .",
    "the stochastic bifurcation analysis is carried out on available experimental data @xcite with the _ ppk1 _ gene designed to be tetracycline - inducible .",
    "figure [ fig9](b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) shows the distribution of rel levels in the stationary phase of a population of _ m.smegmatis _ cells for three different inducer concentrations @xmath202 ( in nm ) .",

    "the quantitative measure of regime shifts , namely , the ptp , proposed in this letter is of broad applicability and can be computed both when the model dynamics are known or when only the time series data are available .",
    "the physical interpretation of the ptp in terms of a tipping of the balance towards one regime or the other helps in identifying the parameter regime to be avoided in order to forestall disastrous regime shifts .",
    "the variation of the equipartition point @xmath22 versus a bifurcation parameter provides advanced knowledge of the approach to the ptp .",
    "a number of signatures of impending regime shifts have been proposed so far in the scenario of the saddle - node bifurcation @xcite .",
    "these include the critical slowing down , rising variance and skewness of a subpopulation probability distribution and the rising lag-@xmath204 auto - correlation function , as a function of the bifurcation parameter .",
    "if the model governing the dynamics of the system of interest is known , one can calculate the return time ( the time taken by a system to regain its stable steady state after the system is weakly perturbed ) using the standard procedure of linear stability analysis @xcite .",
    "the return time diverges ( critical slowing down ) as a bifurcation point at which the steady state loses its stability is approached . a variety of techniques , e.g.",
    ", the linear noise approximation @xcite can be used to calculate quantities like the variance and the lag-@xmath204 autocorrelation function .",
    "the demonstration of the skewness of a subpopulation probability distribution as the bifurcation point is approached requires the use of somewhat ad - hoc procedures for obtaining a component probability distribution from the total distribution @xcite .",
    "one of these is to introduce suitable cut - off procedures to isolate a component distribution which exhibits rising skewness as a bifurcation point is approached .",
    "the formalism developed in this paper for a quantitative characterization of noise - induced regime shifts is applicable even when only time series data are available , without an adequate knowledge of the underlying model . to make the analysis possible",
    ", one has to identify a parameter @xmath205 which is a relevant bifurcation parameter .",
    "if time series data are available over a sufficiently long interval of time , for which @xmath205 remains constant , one can construct the probability distribution of the relevant variable from the data itself .",
    "similar probability distributions can be computed for other values of @xmath205 if it is a changing function of time .",
    "several studies have recently been undertaken on the early signatures of sudden regime shifts @xcite when only time series data are available . as already discussed in the introduction , regime shifts are often noise - induced .",
    "such transitions , depending on the magnitude of the noise , may occur even when the system is not close to a bifurcation point .",
    "the frequency of the transitions is expected to increase in the vicinity of the bifurcation point .",
    "the method developed in the present study is based on the concept of the ptp which precedes the bifurcation point .",
    "the sharp fall of the equipartition point @xmath22 in the vicinity of the ptp also serves as an indicator of the system approaching a bifurcation point apart from signifying a stochastic shift in the propensity of the system to be in one of two alternative regimes .",
    "the utility of the ptp formalism has been demonstrated for both one - variable and two - variable models .",
    "the @xmath22 versus bifurcation parameter plot further carries a distinctive signature of the saddle - node bifurcation when the plot exhibits a sharp fall .",
    "the sharp fall of @xmath22 in the vicinity of the ptp is an indicator of a stochastic regime shift .",
    "regime shifts are of common occurrence in wide ranging dynamical systems",
    ". the shifts may be due to changing parameters resulting in a bifurcation or due to a large perturbation causing a switch between one attractor state to another across the border separating the basins of attraction of the attractors or due to noisy dynamics with the fluctuations in key variables driving the regime shift .",
    "a large number of studies @xcite provide a quantitative characterization of sudden regime shifts at the bifurcation points .",
    "the present study focuses on a quantitative indicator of stochastic regime shifts which has a simple physical interpretation and is straightforward to compute .",
