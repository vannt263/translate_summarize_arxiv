    "in the early 1970 s , philippe delsarte showed that there is a remarkable connection between three objects in mathematics :    1 .",
    "strongly regular graphs ; 2 .",
    "linear codes with two weights ; 3 .",
    "sets of points in a projective space with two intersection sizes with respect to hyperplanes .    to illustrate these connections ,",
    "consider the five - dimensional projective space over the field of order @xmath0 .",
    "there are some captivating examples of two - intersection sets in this space , one of which was discovered by ray hill @xcite in 1973 and it is known as _ hill s @xmath2-cap _ since it consists of @xmath2 points ( of @xmath3 ) , no three lying on a common line .",
    "this cap has the property that any hyperplane of @xmath3 has only two possible ways of intersecting the cap : in @xmath4 or @xmath5 points .",
    "equivalently , we can associate the points of this cap with the columns of a generator matrix for a ternary linear code with parameters @xmath6 $ ] and weights @xmath7 and @xmath8 . using a beautiful geometric construction known as _ linear representation _ , hill s @xmath2-cap gives rise to a geometry known as a _ partial quadrangle _ , and it therefore gives rise to a strongly regular graph on @xmath9 vertices .",
    "today , we also know that hill s @xmath2-cap is intimately linked to of the hermitian variety @xmath10 and to an interesting imprimitive cometric @xmath11-antipodal @xmath12-class association scheme @xcite .",
    "there are other examples in this space found by gulliver @xcite , and these examples have something in common ; they each admit a common symmetry of order @xmath1 , which happens to be @xmath13 when @xmath14 . in general ,",
    "when @xmath15 , we can _ factor out _ this symmetry and identify these two - intersection sets with subsets of the classical algebraic variety known as the _ cubic segre variety _",
    "( see section [ segre ] ) .",
    "this paper details the search for , and enumeration of , a family of strongly regular graphs arising from two - intersection sets of @xmath16 .",
    "of the three mathematical objects above , two - intersection sets are the most readily computable , and hence effort was focused on finding two - intersection sets using linear programming techniques . in particular , the projective space @xmath16 was examined as a successor to @xmath17 , since the binary projective codes of dimension at most @xmath18 have been classified by bouyukliev @xcite .",
    "over 6000 new strongly regular graphs were discovered as a result of enumerating two - weight ternary codes of dimension @xmath18 , many of which overlap the list of codes on kohnert s webpage . up to projective equivalence , there are 6635 such two - intersection sets of @xmath3 invariant under a collineation of order @xmath1 .",
    "we begin with the elementary definitions of all three objects , and the relationships between them . an _",
    "@xmath19 $ ] linear code _ is a @xmath20-dimensional subspace of @xmath21 , and its vectors are known as _ codewords_. the weight of a codeword is the number of non - zero values in its coordinate vector .",
    "every @xmath19 $ ] linear code is the rowspace of some @xmath22 generator matrix .",
    "a linear code @xmath23 is _ projective _ if no two columns of its generator matrix are linearly dependent .",
    "equivalently , @xmath23 is projective if the minimum weight of the dual code @xmath24 of @xmath23 is at least @xmath0 .",
    "a two - weight linear code is simply a linear code in which all non - zero codewords have weight one of two fixed values @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "the family of two - weight linear codes is an important one ; a @xmath27-error - correcting linear code is perfect if and only if its dual is a two - weight code , and a @xmath28-error - correcting linear code is uniformly packed if and only if its dual is a two - weight code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.2 , theorem 4.3 ) .",
    "a two - intersection set @xmath29 with parameters @xmath30 is a set of points in @xmath31 such that every hyperplane in @xmath31 is incident with either @xmath32 or @xmath33 points in @xmath29 .",
    "for example , the points lying on a line form a simple two - intersection set with parameters @xmath34 : every hyperplane either lies completely on the line ( and hence intersects it at @xmath35 points ) , or meets it at one point .",
    "the complement of a two - intersection set with parameters @xmath30 is again a two - intersection set ( but with different parameters ) .",
    "every projective two - weight linear code arises from a two - intersection set and gives rise to a strongly regular graph .",
    "a strongly regular graph with parameters @xmath36 is a graph containing @xmath37 vertices in which every vertex has degree @xmath20 , every two adjacent vertices share @xmath38 common neighbours , and every two non - adjacent vertices share @xmath39 common neighbours .",
    "the following results were originally proved by delsarte @xcite , and provide the necessary details for converting a two - intersection set into a two - weight linear code and for converting a two - weight linear code into a two - intersection set or a strongly regular graph .    if @xmath40 is a two - intersection set with parameters @xmath41 that spans @xmath42 , then @xmath43 is the generator matrix of a projective two - weight @xmath19 $ ] linear code with weights @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where it is understood that the @xmath46 are vectors representing the homogeneous coordinates of points of @xmath47 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath48 is the generator matrix of a projective two - weight @xmath19 $ ] linear code with weights @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then @xmath49 are the homogeneous coordinate vectors for a two - intersection set with parameters @xmath50 that spans @xmath42 .",
    "delsarte defined the associated graph @xmath51 of a projective two - weight linear code @xmath52 with weights @xmath25 and @xmath26 as follows : let the vertices of @xmath51 correspond to the codewords of @xmath52 .",
    "two distinct vertices in @xmath51 are adjacent if and only if the weight of the difference between their corresponding codewords is @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath51 is a strongly regular graph for any projective two - weight linear code @xmath52 .",
    "our motivation stemmed from the fact that many of the most interesting two - intersection sets of @xmath16 had a stabiliser divisible by @xmath1 , and @xmath1 is a primitive prime divisor of @xmath54 ( and so an element of order @xmath1 must act irreducibly ) .",
    "the hill @xmath2-cap and the examples found by gulliver could be constructed by taking unions of orbits of this cyclic subgroup . restricting the search to two - intersection sets that could be constructed in this manner prevented the scope of the problem from becoming infeasible and allowed for a full enumeration of possible solutions . to classify all two - weight ternary codes of dimension",
    "@xmath18 seems to be out of the current range of computational power .",
    "let us model @xmath55 simply as the field extension @xmath56 over @xmath57 . if @xmath58 is a primitive root of @xmath56 , then multiplication by @xmath58 yields a cyclic subgroup acting regularly on the points of @xmath55 ; the so - called _ singer cycle _ of @xmath55 .",
    "if we raise @xmath58 to a suitable power , namely @xmath59 , then we will obtain a field element of order @xmath60 in @xmath56 , which will induce a collineation @xmath61 of @xmath55 of order @xmath13 .",
    "alternatively , we can write the orbits of @xmath61 down by taking the equivalence classes of the following relation : @xmath62 where @xmath63 .    a two - intersection set invariant under @xmath61",
    "will automatically span @xmath55 since @xmath61 acts irreducibly on this space .",
    "the map @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 , [ y_{1 } , y_{2 } , y_{3 } ] ) = [ x_{1 } y_{1 } , x_{1 } y_{2 } , x_{1 } y_{3 } , x_{2 } y_{1 } , x_{2 } y_{2 } , x_{2 } y_{3}]\\ ] ] is a _ segre embedding _ , and the image of this map is a cubic _",
    "segre variety _",
    "@xmath66 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 25 ) ) . in order to work with this segre embedding",
    ", it became necessary to find an equivalent operation over elements of @xmath67 .",
    "the map @xmath68 from @xmath69 to @xmath56 is equivalent to the segre embedding @xmath70 .",
    "we model @xmath71 as @xmath72 over @xmath73 with basis @xmath74 , and @xmath75 as @xmath76 over @xmath73 with basis @xmath77 .",
    "now suppose we have @xmath78 \\in { \\mathsf{pg}}(1 , q)$ ] and @xmath79 \\in { \\mathsf{pg}}(2 , q)$ ] ; that is , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "+ clearly , @xmath82 so it suffices to show that @xmath83 is a basis for @xmath67 ( over @xmath73 ) .    to this end , suppose @xmath84 .",
    "further suppose , for the sake of contradiction , that @xmath85 .",
    "we may then rearrange the equation as follows : @xmath86    noting that the left hand side of the equation is an element of @xmath72 , and the right hand side of the equation is an element of @xmath76 , we conclude that both sides of the equation are elements of @xmath87",
    ". then we must have @xmath88 , for some @xmath89  a contradiction .",
    "hence , we must have @xmath90 and consequently , @xmath91 . as @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are linearly independent , we see that @xmath95 .",
    "this confirms that @xmath96 is a basis for @xmath67 .",
    "it was discovered that , for certain values of @xmath97 , the image of @xmath70 is a transversal of the orbits discussed above .    for @xmath98 ,",
    "every equivalence class of @xmath99 contains exactly one element of the segre variety arising from the products @xmath100    consider the following subgroup of @xmath56 of order @xmath101 : @xmath102 we will first show that the subgroup @xmath103 is contained in @xmath57 .    the order of the intersection @xmath103 must divide the order of both subgroups , and hence must also divide @xmath104 noting that @xmath105 and @xmath106 are coprime , we may simplify the expression to @xmath107 this can be further simplified to @xmath108 , with one step of the euclidean algorithm . clearly , when @xmath98 , the above expression evaluates to @xmath109 .",
    "in these cases , the order of @xmath103 divides the order of @xmath57 , and hence @xmath103 is a subgroup of @xmath57 .",
    "now we may proceed to proving the stated result .",
    "suppose @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we show that if @xmath112 and @xmath113 are in the same equivalence class of @xmath114 , they represent the same element of the segre variety . to do so",
    ", we suppose that @xmath115 . this equation can be rearranged into the form @xmath116^{(q^2 - q + 1)(q - 1 ) } = 1 $ ] .",
    "so @xmath117 is an element of @xmath103 , and is therefore in @xmath57 , using the fact shown above .",
    "hence , we have @xmath118 , for some @xmath119 , which may be rearranged into the form @xmath120 . therefore , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are projectively equivalent .",
    "we have shown , then , that the segre variety arising from @xmath121 is a transversal of the given equivalence classes , as there are an equal number of equivalence classes and elements of @xmath121 .",
    "this relationship between the segre variety and the orbits of a collineation group allows for the expression of conforming two - intersection sets as geometric entities in the segre variety . every orbit included in such a two - intersection set corresponds to exactly one point in the segre variety .",
    "fix a primitive root @xmath58 of @xmath122 .",
    "then we can describe the eight orbits comprising the hill @xmath2-cap by single elements of the segre variety : @xmath123 these elements of the segre variety were obtained by taking the products @xmath124 , where @xmath125 note that the first coordinates of these pairs are each divisible by @xmath126 , and the second coordinates are each divisible by @xmath127 ( and so @xmath128 and @xmath129 for each @xmath130 ) .",
    "we will catalogue each of our examples in section [ results ] by points of the segre variety in this way .",
    "the following is an extension of the results presented by penttila and royle @xcite , and was used to quickly identify implausible parameter sets in the computational search .",
    "suppose @xmath29 is a two - intersection set with parameters @xmath30 .",
    "then there must exist an integer solution to : @xmath131    if @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the number of hyperplanes that are incident with @xmath32 and @xmath33 points in @xmath29 , respectively , then counting arguments reveal the following equations :    l|p7 cm + @xmath134 & counting the number of hyperplanes +   + @xmath135 & counting incident point - hyperplane pairs +   + @xmath136 &    counting triples @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are two different points incident with the hyperplane @xmath140     +    if we take the left - hand sides of these three equations , and sum them with coefficients @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath28 accordingly , we will obtain @xmath143 .",
    "the result then follows .",
    "suppose @xmath29 is a two - intersection set with parameters @xmath30",
    ". then @xmath144 must divide @xmath145 .",
    "suppose that @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the number of hyperplanes through a point @xmath148 that are incident with @xmath32 and @xmath33 points in @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "similarly , suppose @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the number of hyperplanes through a point @xmath151 that are incident with @xmath32 and @xmath33 points in @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "then counting arguments show that : @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 @xmath155 by solving this system of equations , we see that @xmath156 must be an integer .",
    "a significant advantage of searching for two - intersection sets , rather than the other mathematical objects discussed in this paper , is the relative ease with which two - intersection sets can be found computationally .",
    "the task of finding two - intersection sets in a projective space can be naturally represented as a linear programming problem , as evinced by kohnert @xcite .",
    "this section details a method of framing the task in such a way .",
    "let @xmath157 be a group of collineations of @xmath55 .",
    "we let @xmath158 be the @xmath157-quotient of the point - hyperplane incidence matrix wherein the @xmath159 entry is the number of elements from the @xmath160th @xmath157-orbit on points incident with the @xmath161th @xmath157-orbit representative on hyperplanes .",
    "alternatively , we can use a duality arising from a bilinear form , say , so that the hyperplanes are replaced by points and incidence is replaced by orthogonality . in our application , where @xmath157 is a cyclic group of order @xmath13 acting on @xmath55 , we can simply construct @xmath158 by indexing its rows and columns by the cubic segre variety @xmath66 . the relative trace map ( from @xmath67 to @xmath73 ) yields a bilinear form when we model @xmath55 by the field @xmath67 : @xmath162 hence , we may instead calculate @xmath163 by calculating the number of elements @xmath164 such that @xmath165 , where @xmath166 are the @xmath160-th and @xmath161-th elements of the segre variety modelled in @xmath67 .",
    "an _ orbit inclusion vector _ is a 0 - 1 vector in which the @xmath160th entry is @xmath28 or @xmath143 , dependent on whether the @xmath160-th orbit is included or excluded from the current point set ( resp . ) .",
    "clearly , premultiplying the inclusion vector with the incidence matrix yields a vector wherein the @xmath160-th entry contains the number of points in the current point set incident with the @xmath160-th hyperplane .    in order to find a two - intersection set with intersection values @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ", we need to find solutions to the system of equations : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a 0 - 1 vector .",
    "while this is not a linear system , it can be converted into one with a minor modification . for a given solution @xmath168 ,",
    "we introduce a vector @xmath169 of length @xmath37 , such that the @xmath160th entry of @xmath169 is @xmath143 if the @xmath160th hyperplane is incident with @xmath32 points , or @xmath28 if the @xmath160th hyperplane is incident with @xmath33 points .",
    "this allows the problem to be framed as a linear system of equations : @xmath170 which can then be solved with software such as _ gurobi _ @xcite .",
    "this also has the benefit of immediately revealing which hyperplanes are incident with @xmath32 points and which are incident with @xmath33 .",
    "an initial search for two - intersection sets , filtered only by fulfilment of the necessary conditions discussed above , was able to return hundreds of thousands of results without exhausting the problem space . to prevent the re - computation of redundant data , the action of the full collineation group was used to impose a number of constraints on the search .",
    "we computed valuable information regarding the symmetries of the projective space using the free software package gap @xcite .",
    "firstly , it was noted that the normaliser of our element @xmath61 of order @xmath1 in the full collineation group acted transitively on the point - orbits of @xmath61 , meaning any solution was equivalent to one that included the first orbit .",
    "hence , the first orbit was selected in every one of the reported solutions .",
    "next , the subgroup that stabilised the first orbit was examined .",
    "this group had nine orbits itself , represented by the orbits with indices in the set @xmath171 .",
    "hence , any solution that included two or more orbits was equivalent to one that included either orbits 1 and 2 , or orbits 1 and 3 , or orbits 1 and 5 etc .",
    "the solution space was then restricted to ensure that one of these orbit pairs was always included .",
    "this method was reapplied to those subproblems that proved computationally difficult .",
    "for instance , including orbits 1 and 2 in a solution was shown to be equivalent to including one of nine triples of orbits . in this manner , a tree of computations was formed and traversed , sometimes reaching seven levels deep .",
    "one optimisation that proved particularly efficient was facilitated by the use of the branching method discussed above . as noted ,",
    "there are many sets of orbits that are equivalent to one another .",
    "the search was accelerated by precluding the consideration of any set equivalent to one already encountered .",
    "for example , there exist 52 pairs of orbits whose inclusion is equivalent to the inclusion of the orbits 1 and 2 . hence , after all solutions containing orbits 1 and 2 have been found , any of these 52 equivalent pairs of orbits can be excluded from appearing again in any future results .",
    "these optimisation techniques allowed for the enumeration of all @xmath61-invariant two - intersection sets in @xmath172 within a viable time - frame ( approximately 2 weeks ) .    in order to have confidence in the correctness of the search",
    ", we used the constraint satisfaction solver minion @xcite to simulate some of our results .",
    "in particular , we enumerated all the two - intersection sets with parameters @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , or @xmath177 , invariant under a group with order divisible by @xmath1 , and we obtained the same results which we outline in table [ smallparams ] :    .examples for small parameter sets . [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above examples give rise to strongly regular graphs with parameters @xmath178 .",
    "the example with stabiliser of order @xmath179 arises by taking the derived subgroup of the stabiliser of the hill - cap .",
    "this group has orbit lengths @xmath2 , @xmath2 , @xmath180 , @xmath180 on the points of @xmath3 .",
    "taking a union of an orbit of size @xmath2 with one of size @xmath180 yields a two - intersection set with parameters @xmath181 .",
    "the five examples in the table above that have an asterisk in the last column arise from partial spreads of @xmath3 ; the ` su2 ' construction in @xcite .",
    "two of these examples arise from the ` cy2 ' construction in @xcite , denoted by two asterisks .",
    "first the second author would like to acknowledge pablo spiga for invaluable discussions on research related to this work . in particular , there are some amorphic @xmath0-class association schemes related to some of the codes found in our search .",
    "we would like to thank gordon royle and michael giudici for their invaluable time and for the use of their computational facilities .",
    "finally , we also acknowledge andrew bassom for supporting the first author in a summer vacation scholarship ."
