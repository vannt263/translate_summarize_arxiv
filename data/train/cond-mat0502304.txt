    "recent imaging experiments@xcite on quantum hall systems have resolved individual localised states and identified discrete charging events in which the charge of these states jumps when the mean electron density of the system is altered .",

    ", the charging events are believed to involve the addition or removal of a single electron@xcite to or from the localised state .",
    "close to a fractional quantum hall plateau , by contrast , the observed jumps in localised charge correspond to the movement of _ fractionally _ charged quasiparticles.@xcite the latter measurements therefore provide a very direct probe of these quasiparticles , whose existence is central to the theory of the fractional quantum hall effect.@xcite    in this paper , motivated by these experiments , we set out a simple description of a localised state in a quantum hall system for a regime where behaviour is dominated by coulomb interactions .",
    "we treat interactions using the thomas - fermi approximation , making use of the well - established picture for screening in integer quantum hall systems,@xcite in which the sample is divided into compressible regions where the local landau - level filling factor is non - integer , and incompressible regions where the filling factor is integer . taking this approach , a localised variation in charge density , embedded in an incompressible background ,",

    "there is scope to compare these results with experiment in several different ways .    first , the most striking feature of the observations is the fact that , considering behaviour as a function of average electron density @xmath66 and flux density @xmath67 , a particular charging event takes place on a line in the @xmath66-@xmath67 plane which is parallel to one of the lines of integer filling factor @xmath68 .",
    "such behaviour is built into the model we have studied . in particular , suppose that @xmath69 landau levels in the sample are completely filled , so that the charge density within the quantum dot ( @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) lies in the @xmath70 th level . in that case , if @xmath66 and @xmath67 vary together along a line in the @xmath66-@xmath67 plane parallel to @xmath71 , the charge density variation in the sample is uniform in space and the screened potential remains constant ; as a consequence , the charge of the quantum dot is unchanged .",
    "conversely , charging events are produced by moving in a perpendicular direction in the @xmath66-@xmath67 plane .",
    "this account omits the single - particle contribution , @xmath72 , to the energy of the charge within the dot .",
    "the approximation is justified because the electrostatic part of the energy of the two - dimensional electron gas is dominant .    turning to more specific aspects of our modelling , it is useful to focus on results that are independent of the model parameter @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and of measurement calibration .",
    "two such results ( which are physically related to each other ) are the power laws appearing in the dependence of dot radius on electron number , eq .",
    "( [ radius ] ) , and in the chemical potential values at which charge jumps occur , eq .  ( [ michange ] ) .",
    "while dot radius is probably difficult to measure precisely , because of issues of resolution , as discussed below , the relative size of chemical potential steps required to add a sequence of charges should be an accessible quantity .",
    "specifically , charge jumps are produced experimentally by a change in the backgate voltage applied to a sample:@xcite fitting the ratio of voltage steps for successive jumps to eq .",
    "( [ michange ] ) would provide a test of the theory we have presented and a determination of the number of electrons within the dot . deviations from the theory would arise either if the confining potential is not parabolic , or , more interestingly , if many - body correlations within the compressible region , which are omitted from thomas - fermi theory , make an important contribution to the total energy of the electrons in the dot . even in these cases",
    ", we expect as a robust feature a decrease in the size of voltage steps between charge jumps as electron number increases .",
    "in addition , one can attempt an absolute comparison of theoretical and experimental quantities . as an illustration ,",

    ", one can regard our calculation of @xmath82 , illustrated in fig .",

    "we have presented a simple model for the imaging experiments of ref . and .",
    "a closer comparison between observations and calculations should help determine the numbers of electrons contained in localised states and the spatial size of these states , while deviations of measurements from this theory may be an indication of correlation effects ."
