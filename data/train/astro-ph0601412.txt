    "2005 ) evidence supports this picture although several topics remain unsolved ( e.g. peebles  2002 , tantalo & chiosi  2004 ) .",
    "early - type galaxies show several correlations among their colours , luminosities , velocity dispersions , effective radii and surface brightness ( e.g. baum  1990 , faber  &  jackson  1976 , kormendy  1977 , djorgovski  & davis  1987 , dressler  et  al .  1987 , bernardi  et  al .",
    "these correlations provide constraints to any theory of formation and evolution of these galaxies .",
    "furthermore , their properties are linked with the distribution of luminous and dark matter , that would be important when comparing with models of formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "observational studies [ e.g. caon , capaccioli & donofrio 1993 ( ccd93 ) , graham & colles  1997 , binggeli & jerjen 1998 , donofrio  2001 ( d01 ) , trujillo  et  al .",
    "2004 ] have found that the surface brightness density profiles of early - type galaxies are better described by a srsic ( 1968 ) @xmath19profile than the classical de  vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) @xmath20profile .",
    "the index @xmath4 is directly related with the curvature and `` concentration '' of the light profile ( trujillo , graham & caon  2001 ) .",
    "several observational relationships have been found between the index @xmath4 and , for example , the total luminosity ( @xmath21 ) , effective radius ( @xmath7 ) and central velocity dispersion ( e.g. ccd93 , prugniel & simien  1997 , graham & guzmn  2003 ) . also , it has been found a linear relation among @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( central brightness ) termed the photometric plane ( php ) for early - type galaxies [ e.g. khosroshahi  et  al .",

    "recently , rothberg  &  joseph ( 2004 , rj04 ) have found that nearby merger remnants have a peak in the @xmath4-distribution at @xmath25 with most values in the range of @xmath26 , and in some cases it is found that @xmath27 .    on other hand ,",
    "theoretical studies of srsic properties of merger remnants have appeared recently .",
    "for example , gnzalez - garca  &  balcells ( 2005 , ggb ) and naab  &  trujillo  ( 2005 , nt ) find in collision - less simulations that bulge - less progenitors lead to ranges of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ; when a single srsic function is used to fit the entire remnant . for progenitors with a bulge component",
    "they obtain about the same range of srsic index , @xmath30 .",
    "since `` bona fide '' ellipticals have values @xmath31 , they reach the conclusion that collision - less merger remnants of pure disc galaxies do not lead to concentrations , indicated by @xmath4 , similar to those found in intermediate or giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. graham  et  al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the above findings suggest that a primordial bulge in spirals is a necessary condition to form bona fide ellipticals in the hierarchical merging scenario .",
    "however , we show below , collision - less mergers of pure discs can cover the range of observed values of the shape parameter @xmath4 , and can reproduce adequately other observational correlations .",
    "srsic model in a de - projected form has been recently used to represent the dark matter distribution in @xmath15cdm haloes ( navarro  et  al .",

    "2005 , prada  et  al .",
    "2005 ) , in order to have a better estimation of the inner asymptotic logarithmic derivative .",
    "a mean value of a 3d srsic index @xmath32 , with a scatter of @xmath33 , has been found in these works .",
    "so it is of interest to determine the three - dimensional srsic parameters that characterise our remnants .    in this work ,",
    "we study the structural properties of remnants as provided by fitting a srsic profile to their luminous and dark mass distribution .",
    "the paper has been organised as follows : in @xmath34[sec : model ] we present a summary of the properties of our progenitors , some details of the simulations performed , as well as some basic characteristics of srsic profile ; both projected and deprojected . in @xmath34[sec : results ] we present distributions and correlations , in two and three - dimensions , found among the different srsic parameters for our remnants , and compare them with observations .",
    "srsic properties of the dark haloes of the remnants are determined , some correlations presented , and compared with those obtained in cosmological simulations . some final comments are given in @xmath34[sec : discussion ] and a summary of our conclusions .",
    "the galaxy models used in this work have been already described in aceves & velzquez ( 2005 ) and follow the method outlined by shen , mo & shu ( 2002 ) to obtain the global properties of the discs , once the haloes properties are known .",
    "our numerical galaxies do _ not _ include a bulge - like component .",
    "the dark haloes follow a modified nfw ( navarro , frenk & white  1997 ) model with an exponential cutoff .",
    "the discs have a typical exponential density profile , and satisfy the tully - fisher relation at redshift @xmath35 ; roughly a look - back time of @xmath36gyr in a @xmath15cdm cosmology with hubble parameter @xmath37 . only discs satisfying the efstathiou ,",

    "this is a merger from the resulting remnants of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , label @xmath40 .",
    "all simulations were carried out using a parallel version of gadget-1.1 code , a tree base code ( springel , yoshida & white 2001 ) , and evolved for @xmath41gyr with conservation of energy better than @xmath42 percent .",
    "we fit only srsic profiles to our merger remnants ; no bulge - disc decomposition is attempted since progenitors lack any bulge component .",
    "the srsic surface luminous - mass density profile is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the projected spherical radius , @xmath7 is the effective radius , @xmath4 the index of the profile , @xmath45 ( ciotti & bertin 1999 ) and @xmath46 the central surface density",
    ". index @xmath4 is associated with the curvature and the concentration of the profile ( trujillo , graham & caon  2001 ) ; @xmath47 corresponds to an exponential profile while the classical de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) profile is obtained for @xmath48 .",
    "the accumulated projected luminous mass , @xmath49 , is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "the total projected luminosity mass is given by @xmath54 being @xmath55 the complete gamma function .",

    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) srsic profile is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the spatial radius , @xmath60 ( graham  et  al .",
    "2005 ) such that @xmath61 is the half - mass spatial radius .",
    "the total mass is determined from @xmath62    srsic parameters for the luminous component were computed along 400 different random line - of - sights . to each projection",
    "a circularly averaged density profile @xmath63 was determined , and a srsic profile ( [ eq : sersic ] ) fitted by @xmath64minimisation using the levenberg - marquardt method ( press  et  al .",
    "1992 ) to obtain @xmath65 .",
    "srsic parameters for dark haloes are obtained by a similar procedure , but using equation ( [ eq:3dsersic ] ) .",
    "the fitting set of parameters depend on the methodology used to obtain them .",
    "in particular , there have been indications that these parameters depend on both the covered range of surface brightness range ( e.g. capaccioli , caon & donofrio 1992 ) and the spatial radial interval for fitting ( e.g. kelson  et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "also , the determination of fitted parameters degrades when the inner parts of a galaxy are not well considered .",
    "for example , the index @xmath4 tends more to be a representation of the outer slope of the profile than of the curvature of the luminosity distribution ( graham  et  al .",
    "the treatment and quality of data has also an effect on the fitted parameters .",
    "for example , ccd93 obtain higher values of @xmath4 for ngc  4406 , ngc  4552 and ngc  1399 ( 14.9 , 13.9 , 16.8 ) in comparison with d01 ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) .",
    "we have considered two radial intervals for our fits in order to asses their effect on the srsic parameters .",
    "the first radial interval , @xmath69 , is taken from our numerical resolution value @xmath70pc to the outer radius @xmath71 , which encloses 95 percent of the projected luminous mass and is determined directly from the simulations ; thus , @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "the second one , @xmath73 , uses another inner point at @xmath74,cdm cosmology with @xmath37 we have that @xmath75 at the distance of the coma cluster ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath77pc at @xmath78 , and @xmath79kpc at @xmath80 . ] and outer point at @xmath81 ; this enclosing 70 percent of the luminous mass .",
    "for each line - of - sight used , two uniform random numbers @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 $ ] are generated that in turn define @xmath84 $ ] . in the appendix",
    "we discuss some effects the radial range of a fit has on the parameters estimated using synthetic models .",
    "in this section we present the results of the fittings done , both `` luminous '' and dark , to the merger remnants , as well as several relationships among them based in observational studies .",
    "table  [ tab : global ] lists different global physical properties of our remnants obtained directly from the @xmath18-body simulations .",
    "column ( 2 ) is the total half - mass radius @xmath85 , ( 3 ) the virial radius @xmath86 , ( 4 ) the virial velocity @xmath87 , ( 5 ) the total luminous mass @xmath88 and ( 6 ) the total bounded mass @xmath89 , and column ( 7 ) is the virial ratio at the end of the simulation .",
    "the last column ( 8) provides the ratio of the total mass of the secondary to the primary galaxy in the simulations . the merger labelled as @xmath40 corresponds to the simulation where the resulting remnants of @xmath38 and @xmath39 were merged together in a parabolic encounter .",
    "we now consider that the case where the underlying mass distribution follows a hernquist model . here , @xmath90 denotes its theoretical projected half - light ( mass ) radius .",
    "it is found that in the fitting interval @xmath91r_{\\rm hl}$ ] , the underlying hernquist s profile is fitted by a srsic profile with index @xmath92 and @xmath93 in agreement with nt .",
    "for a radial fitting interval of @xmath94r_{\\rm hl}$ ] we find that @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this indicates that the process of fitting a srsic profile is far more sensitive when the underlying mass distribution does not follows a srsic one .",
    "the above was already noted by boylan - kolchin , ma & quataert  ( 2005 ) , where a systematic change in srsic parameters was found when trying to fit a hernquist profile . in figure",
