    "interference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 decay amplitudes can be used to determine the weak phase @xmath7 there are many hadronic final states that can be used to add information about @xmath2  @xcite and , what is relevant to our case , some of them have one ( or more ) neutral kaon in the final state .",
    "all methods of determining @xmath2 from @xmath0 involve deriving a system of equations for @xmath2 in terms of the decay widths and amplitudes for the various processes involved .",
    "if all other quantities can be determined experimentally this allows for a model - independent determination of @xmath2 .",
    "thus far cp violation associated with neutral kaons in the determination of @xmath2 has been neglected since the effect is expected to be much smaller than current experimental uncertainties . as more statistics become available new sources of cp violation in the overall process will become significant and will need to be taken into account . in this work we study the effects of cp violation in the kaon system on the determination of @xmath2 .",
    "such effects were studied in other systems in @xcite .",
    "as we will see , there are effects that are linear in @xmath8 , and they are parametrically enhanced by @xmath4 ( we use standard notations that are defined below ) . once cp violation in the kaon system",
    "is included it is crucial that the time dependence of the kaon mixing be taken into account .",
    "this must be done in a way which considers time dependent detector efficiencies , and thus it can only be carried out by each experiment separately as part of their analysis .",
    "to understand the main issues associated with including kaon mixing and cpv effects , we start with the theoretically simplest case , which is the glw method @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a strong phase and @xmath12 is a real parameter which accounts for color and ckm suppression , and is measured to be of order @xmath13 .",
    "we consider @xmath14 decays , but the @xmath15 can be exchanged for another cp eigenstate such as @xmath16 and the same discussion would apply .",
    "we further assume @xmath17 and its cp conjugate are doubly cabbibo suppressed , and there is no real complication in including them , they are unimportant for our current discussion , so for the moment we set them to zero ( they are included in our final results ) .",
    "we also neglect terms of order @xmath18 in this section for simplicity . for the kaons we use the standard notation @xmath19 where in the last term we neglected direct cpv in kaon decays , that is , we set @xmath20 .",
    "we define the time dependent asymmetry @xmath21 in the above @xmath22 is the proper time of the kaon system , and by @xmath23 we refer to a kaon that decays into two pions ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we work to first order in @xmath8 and we neglect terms of order @xmath18 to find @xmath24 where as usual @xmath25    it is useful to consider also the case where we integrate over the kaon lifetime . following  @xcite we parametrize the experiment - dependent efficiency to detect the kaon by @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath28 must be determined as part of the experimental analysis .",
    "we then define the time integrated asymmetry @xmath29 } { \\int f(t ) \\,dt\\ , [ \\gamma(b^+ \\to ( k_s \\pi^0)_d k^+)+\\gamma(b^- \\to ( k_s \\pi^0)_d k^-)]},\\ ] ] where the integral is from zero to infinity . to demonstrate the effect we take a simple case where @xmath30 and we obtain @xmath31 we can check few limits of the above results :    1 .   for the case of no cpv in kaons , that is , @xmath32 , and to first order in @xmath33 we obtain a_cp= 2r_b()(_b ) , as we should .",
    "the @xmath34 limit corresponds to the case where the only source of cp violation is in the kaon system .",
    "this case was studied for @xmath35 decays in @xcite . using eq .",
    "( [ acp ] ) for @xmath34 we see that a_cp=2 ( ) , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "last we work to first order in @xmath33 and we get @xmath36.\\ ] ] therefore , when both effects are included , @xmath37 ( and therefore the extracted value of @xmath2 ) is shifted by a term of order @xmath38 .",
    "it is the @xmath4 enhancement which makes the effect larger and somewhere at the level that is expected to be probed in the near future .",
    "our goal is to obtain a system of equations for @xmath2 in terms of various experimentally determined quantities in the most general case of a multi - body @xmath1 decay such as @xmath39 .",
    "the quantities involved will be integrated over finite regions of the @xmath1 decay phase space .",
    "here we are using @xmath40 for concreteness , however our discussion will also apply to other decay modes such as @xmath41 and also to two - body decays , such as @xmath42 , in which these amplitudes are not momentum dependent .",
    "we do not include other small effects like @xmath43 mixing which was discussed in @xcite .",
    "note that , though we will not discuss it further , it is imperative to include the effects of @xmath43 mixing since they will be competitive with those of cp violation in @xmath44 mixing .    with this in mind ,",
    "we begin by defining quantities associated with the three - body @xmath1 decay @xmath45 and its cp conjugate @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is either of @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "note that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are analogous to @xmath53 and @xmath54 of @xcite respectively .",
    "we are assuming that we use the @xmath48 final state to tag the kaon as a @xmath55 and we have used ( [ eq : kaondef ] ) .",
    "from now on meson variables such as @xmath56 will be for the @xmath57 unless stated otherwise .",
    "( [ mastercp ] ) are our system of equations which can be used to determine @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are directly measurable in @xmath1 decays .",
    "in addition to these there is a phase , that of @xmath67 , which is momentum dependent in the multi - body case and which must be obtained in addition to @xmath12 and @xmath68 in order to determine @xmath2 .",
    "these equations are identical in form to those from @xcite , and similar to those in @xcite except that we distinguish between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the new complications are hidden in the time - dependence and cp violating parameters stored in @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we should proceed by setting up equations for the dalitz analysis .",
    "this is performed by integrating over bins in the @xmath69 phase space .",
    "first , let us define the momenta of the decay products and the mandelstam variables as in @xcite k(p_1),^-(p_2),^+(p_3 ) , s_ij=(p_i+p_j)^2 . in the @xmath32 limit one has @xmath70 .",
    "one way to think of this is that if the @xmath55 were a cp eigenstate then @xmath71 is a cp eigenstate but for momentum interchange .",
    "the effect due to the fact that the @xmath55 is not a cp eigenstate is that @xmath72 .",
    "we would like to partition the @xmath73 phase space into bins which are symmetric about the line @xmath74 . with @xmath32",
    "very simple relations exist between the various integrals above and below the @xmath74 line . the cp violation in the kaon system , however , complicates this . to this end , we define integrals over bins in phase space @xmath75 @xmath76 where we have emphasized that these quantities all depend on the proper time of the kaon .",
    "the index @xmath77 labels a bin in @xmath73 phase space , and we will let @xmath78 denote the bin obtained by reflecting the bin @xmath77 about @xmath74 .",
    "we can then write a system of equations for integrals of the overall decay width in these bins . at this stage",
    "we assume that we integrate over time , and we obtain @xmath79,\\ ] ] @xmath80.\\ ] ] note that the quantities @xmath81 are the widths for @xmath82 with the @xmath55 identified through its decay and thus can be determined from charm data , so we will treat these as known . in the @xmath32 limit",
    "we have @xmath83 .",
    "in contrast , the variables @xmath84 and @xmath85 arise from interference effects and therefore can not be directly measured in non - interfering @xmath1 decays .",
    "next we perform the counting of the number of observables and parameters to check if we can , in principle , obtain @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath86 the number of bins above the @xmath74 line so that there are @xmath87 bins in total .",
    "we consider @xmath88 different @xmath89 decay modes , such as @xmath90 .",
    "we see that there are @xmath87 @xmath84 s and @xmath87 @xmath85 s , @xmath88 of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and @xmath2 .",
    "we end up with @xmath93 unknowns and @xmath94 equations .",
    "we see that for @xmath95 we can find @xmath86 such that there are more observables than unknowns and thus @xmath2 can be determined without any approximations .",
    "we can also determine @xmath2 in the @xmath96 case using approximations .",
    "one approximation is to use a model for the dalitz plot .",
    "another approximation that can be made is to take advantage of the fact that the main correction to @xmath2 comes from the term that is not proportional to @xmath33 [ see , eq .",
    "( [ mainglw ] ) ] .",
    "thus , dropping terms of order @xmath97 is equivalent to using @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in this case",
    "we have only @xmath100 unknowns with @xmath101 equations which is solvable for @xmath102 .    some other possibilities to reduce the number of unknowns",
    "were discussed in @xcite .",
    "they are applicable here except that one must be careful to distinguish between cp conjugate quantities .      when we outlined how methods for determining @xmath2 from @xmath0 can be adapted to include cp violation in the @xmath44 system we glossed over the time dependence of the kaon decay and oscillations by assuming we integrate over all of time .",
    "this is not realistic since time - dependent efficiencies must be taken into account .",
    "below we discuss the time dependence issue in more detail .",
    "we begin by writing the time dependence explicitly @xmath103,\\ ] ] @xmath104,\\ ] ] @xmath105,\\ ] ] @xmath106,\\ ] ] where we have neglected the @xmath107 term as it is proportional to @xmath108 . in order to translate measurements performed in different timing windows",
    ", one must determine the various momentum dependent coefficients of the different time - dependent functions .",
    "for instance , we will need @xmath109 where @xmath26 is the time - dependent detection efficiency defined above . to obtain such integrals",
    "we must determine both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath110 for each bin by distinguishing between the @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 terms .",
    "when dropping order @xmath97 terms only the first three of these need to be determined .",
    "( some explicit expressions of time integrals can be found in appendix a. )    while in principle knowing @xmath26 will enable us to determine @xmath2 , care must be taken , as the whole program involves data from different experiments .",
    "for example , one uses charm decay data as an input to the @xmath89 decay analysis . in principle @xmath26 can be very different in such experiments , so naive use of this data introduces error . in practice",
    ", we expect @xmath26 to be similar for different experiments so that the induced error will be small . ultimately estimating this effect depends on the details of particular experiments , so this can not be done in a general way .",
    "as we have already alluded to , there are complications that arise when terms of order @xmath97 are included .",
    "this is because there is a new variable ( roughly speaking it is the phase of @xmath114 ) which only appears in interference between @xmath115 and @xmath116 amplitudes . to understand how these terms complicate the analysis",
    ", we should introduce new definitions .",
    "first , we define @xmath117 and the cp conjugate amplitudes @xmath118 we emphasize that @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and their conjugates depend on @xmath73 for multi - body decays . here",
    "@xmath120 is a ckm suppression factor , but we do not know how small it is in any particular region of phase space . from here on we neglect cp violation in the @xmath1 decay , and then we have @xmath122 ( in principle @xmath123 are each measurable through flavor specific decays of the kaon , for example , @xmath124 and its cp conjugates . ) from these we find @xmath125 @xmath126 the cp conjugate expressions for @xmath127 are obtained by @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 .",
    "the phase between @xmath131 and @xmath132 is unphysical but we adopt the convention @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the new phase which occurs only in the @xmath12 terms which can not be obtained through measurements of non - interfering @xmath1 decays alone is that of @xmath135 so we define @xmath136 under an interchange of the pion momenta one has @xmath137 .",
    "the value of this angle at a point in phase space is unphysical , but for a particular choice of @xmath68 it is fixed , and its momentum dependence is physical .",
    "it reduces to @xmath138 of @xcite in the @xmath32 limit .",
    "if one expands out the real and imaginary parts of @xmath67 one will obtain various combinations of @xmath139 and trig functions of @xmath140 such as @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "these are of course multiplied by @xmath144 and are ultimately integrated over bins of phase space .",
    "the full result can be found in appendix a.",
    "as we alluded to previously , some unknowns can be eliminated by assuming a breit - wigner dependence for the @xmath1 decays .",
    "the change one needs to keep in mind when generalizing the discussion of breit - wigner dependence from a case where kaon cp violation is neglected is that cp conjugate amplitudes are no longer related by only an exchange of pion momenta .",
    "we substitute @xmath145 above with a sum over breit - wigner functions @xmath146 where @xmath147 and the index @xmath148 labels the resonance .",
    "the factor @xmath149 depends on the spin of the resonance , for example @xmath150 , @xmath151 where @xmath152 are the spatial momenta of the particles originating from the resonance .",
    "the breit - wigner function is @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the mass of the resonance .",
    "the argument of @xmath155 depends on the particles which participate in the resonance , for example for the @xmath16 the argument of @xmath155 is @xmath156 .",
    "explicit expressions for the mass dependent width @xmath157 and the other @xmath149 s can be found in @xcite .    in order to account for",
    "cp violation in the kaon system one can not assume that the amplitudes are related to their cp conjugates by a momentum exchange alone , for instance @xmath158 the reason for this is that the @xmath55 is not an exactly even superposition of @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "fortunately , these are related through simple momentum independent factors @xmath161 @xmath162 where @xmath163 , @xmath164 with @xmath165 complex and we have neglected cp violation in the @xmath1 decay so that @xmath166 .",
    "similar expressions apply for any resonance decay of the form @xmath167 .",
    "the situation is slightly different for decays in which the @xmath55 emerges from a resonance such as @xmath168 . in this case",
    "a_k^*a(d^0k^*-^+)|a_k^*a(^0k^*+^- ) because @xmath169 .",
    "fortunately , these are again simply related by momentum - independent factors @xmath170 @xmath171 where @xmath172 and we have assumed @xmath173 decays to be forbidden entirely . in this way one can relate @xmath174 to @xmath175 .    for @xmath32 one only has the amplitude @xmath145 , but for finite @xmath176 , we also have @xmath177 , which can be decomposed just like ( [ bwdecomp ] )",
    ". the same discussion on how to account for cp violation applies , however the relation between some of the coefficients is different .",
    "a general procedure for relating amplitude coefficients is as follows    1 .",
    "express decay amplitudes in terms of @xmath178 for resonances which do not decay to the final state neutral kaon , where @xmath57 is one of @xmath179 .",
    "2 .   express decay amplitudes in terms of @xmath180 where @xmath181 is a resonance which decays to a neutral kaon .",
    "3 .   project out the @xmath182 component using the reciprocal basis @xmath183 to relate the various coefficients .    where the @xmath184 is for the @xmath185 and the @xmath186 is for the @xmath55 .",
    "next we estimate the error introduced on the extracted value of @xmath2 if one were to use the standard analysis and neglect cp violation in the kaon system .",
    "we do so by making the following simplifying assumptions : we neglect terms of order @xmath97 , we assume that we integrate over all of the @xmath71 phase space , and we assume that @xmath30 .",
    "a simple expression for @xmath2 can be obtained in terms of the difference @xmath187.\\ ] ] inverting the result for @xmath188 one finds @xmath189 where @xmath190 and @xmath191 and @xmath192 are functions of @xmath123 and @xmath193 which are defined in appendix a. next we define @xmath194 where @xmath195 is @xmath2 as determined from @xmath37 with @xmath196 .",
    "we find @xmath197 and we expect @xmath198 .",
    "to see this , note that in the limit where we neglect doubly cabbibo suppressed @xmath1 decays and let the @xmath1 decay to a true cp eigenstate one obtains the same expression for @xmath199 with @xmath200 .",
    "therefore we find @xmath201 .",
    "there appear to be several limits in which @xmath199 diverges .",
    "the first type is when any of @xmath12 , @xmath191 , or @xmath68 vanish .",
    "none of these are problematic since they arise only when working to leading order , which is no longer justified in that case . keeping the full expression we find @xmath202 which does not depend on @xmath12 , @xmath191 , or @xmath68 .",
    "next we see that @xmath199 appears to diverge for @xmath203 .",
    "this divergence reflects the fact that @xmath188 depends only very weakly on @xmath2 for @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , any source of error in @xmath205 would also cause a large shift in @xmath2 in this region .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath2 using this method is then large for @xmath204 , so we expect that @xmath199 is also large there .",
    "this uncertainty is only intrinsic to the dalitz method where @xmath85 is small . where @xmath84 is small there is a similar uncertainty near @xmath206 .",
    "the effect is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltagamma ] .",
    "the best current determinations of @xmath2 from belle and babar have uncertainties of roughly @xmath207 @xcite .",
    "we expect @xmath208 to be of order @xmath209 so it may be some time before the effect of cp violation in kaon mixing and decay becomes relevant .",
    "this correction is , however , very large compared to the largest irreducible theoretical error on the determination of @xmath2 from @xmath210 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath211 program is known to have the smallest theoretical error in any determination of weak parameters @xcite .",
    "as precision improves it becomes more important to look for sub - leading effects @xcite .",
    "we generalized the @xmath211 method for determining @xmath2 to account for additional sources of cp violation from mixing of final state neutral kaons .",
    "we found that @xmath2 is shifted by an amount of order @xmath212 .",
    "while this effect is still below the current experimental sensitivity , it may be important in the near future .",
    "we have discussed how existing methods can be corrected to account for this effect .",
    "in this appendix we collect more general expressions that we omit in the main text . in the main text we usually kept the @xmath2 dependence explicit , while here we keep the time dependence explicit . consider a @xmath1 meson state which results from the decay of the @xmath213 and which is a superposition of @xmath115 and @xmath116 depending on @xmath214 .",
    "we denote that state @xmath215 .",
    "it is useful to write quantities in terms of @xmath215 decay amplitudes .",
    "we define @xmath216 we also define @xmath217 to be @xmath218 with the @xmath159 replaced by @xmath219 . these amplitudes are simply related @xmath220 and can be expressed in terms of @xmath2 @xmath221 @xmath222 these can be written for the @xmath223 by @xmath61 and @xmath224 .",
