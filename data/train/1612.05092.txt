    "it is by adding potentially double - counting meson exchanges , e.g. a scalar - isoscalar @xmath26 meson , and applying resonating group methods ( rgm ) , that quark - based calculations generate a tightly bound @xmath3 dibaryon .    in this note",

    "the relatively high value of @xmath7015% for the obtained br is excluded by a recent determination of a @xmath71 upper limit  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a value of the @xmath5 br smaller by about a factor of two was obtained , by applying the @xmath52 decay fraction @xmath72 to the @xmath6 partial decay width @xmath73  mev , in the specific mixing model version listing in table  [ tab : br ] .",
    "how robust are the br results shown for the @xmath3@xmath52 coupled channels scheme in table  [ tab : br ] ?",
    "the listed br are based on assuming a value @xmath74  mev . a @xmath7510% variation of this value results in @xmath7650% variation in @xmath77 away from its initially assumed value which can be restored by merely a @xmath7510% variation in @xmath78 away from its initially assumed value .",
    "we conclude that the partial decay widths and br listed in table  [ tab : br ] for a mixing parameter @xmath79 have uncertainties of up to 10% , except for those for the @xmath5 decay mode which depend only on the assumed value of @xmath62 .",

    "the @xmath2(2380 ) is the most promising dibaryon candidate at present , supported by systematic studies of its production and decay in recent wasa - at - cosy experiments  @xcite . in most theoretical works , beginning with the 1964 dyson - xuong prediction @xcite , it is assigned as a @xmath3 quasibound state .",
    "given the small width @xmath85  mev with respect to twice the width of a free - space @xmath17 , @xmath18  mev , its location far from thresholds makes it easier to discard a possible underlying threshold effect .",
    "however , as argued in this work , the observed small width is much larger than what two _ deeply bound _",
    "@xmath17 baryons can yield upon decay .",
    "the @xmath86(2380 ) therefore can not be described exclusively by a @xmath3 component .",
    "a complementary quasi two - body component is offered in the @xmath87 three - body hadronic model of refs .",
    "@xcite by a @xmath52 channel , in which the @xmath2(2380 ) resonates .",
    "the @xmath38 dibaryon stands here for the @xmath49 @xmath28 near - threshold system that might or might not possess a quasibound state @xmath32-matrix pole .",
    "it is a loose system of size typically 1.52  fm , as opposed to the compact @xmath3 component of size 0.51  fm .",
    "it was pointed out how the abc low - mass enhancement in the @xmath88 invariant mass distribution of the @xmath10 fusion reaction at @xmath89  gev might be associated with the small size of the @xmath3 component .",
    "furthermore , we have shown how to determine the relative weight of these two components by fitting to the total @xmath2(2380 ) width , thereby deriving @xmath2 partial decay widths and branching ratios that agree with experiment  @xcite .",
    "a new element in the present derivation is the ability , through the @xmath52 channel , to evaluate the @xmath90 decay width and br .",
    "our prediction is for a br of order 7% , consistent with an upper limit of @xmath71 determined recently  @xcite .",

    "the square of the @xmath104 element is 2/3 , and that of the @xmath105 element is 1/3 .",
    "the @xmath104 projection factor 2/3 is the same as that considered within the @xmath3 model in section  [ sec : s=0 ] .",
    "note that the @xmath5 faddeev calculation of @xmath38 in refs .",
    "@xcite was based on a single @xmath104 , @xmath106 @xmath29-wave configuration , thereby justifying the @xmath104 projection applied here .",
    "note also that with @xmath106 and two @xmath107-wave pions , the angular momentum coupling needed for the @xmath108 @xmath2(2380 ) is unique , with all individual components parallel to each other .",
