    "we study the problem of finding subgraphs with small _ bipartiteness ratio_. let @xmath8 be an undirected graph .",
    "let @xmath9 be two disjoint vertex subsets and @xmath10 .",
    "the bipartiteness ratio of @xmath9 is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 denote the number of edges in @xmath13 and the number of edges leaving from @xmath14 to the rest of the graph , respectively ; and @xmath15 , called the volume of @xmath14 , is defined to be the sum of degrees of vertices in @xmath14 .",
    "the concept of bipartiteness ratio was recently introduced and used as a subroutine to designing approximation algorithms for max cut problem by trevisan  @xcite . in particular",
    ", trevisan showed that this combinatorial object has close relation to the largest eigenvalue of the _ laplacian _ of @xmath16 , the goemans - williamson relaxation and graph sparsification .",
    "another motivation of studying bipartiteness ratio is that it can be considered as a quality of _ dense bipartite - like subgraphs _ , which in turn characterize the communities ( or clusters ) in web graphs  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a dense bipartite - like subgraph is a pair of disjoint vertex subsets @xmath9 such that ` most ' of the edges involving the vertices in @xmath17 lie between @xmath13 and @xmath18 .",
    "equivalently , we say that @xmath9 form a dense bipartite subgraph if ` few ' edges lie totally in @xmath13 or @xmath18 , or leaving @xmath17 to the rest of the graph .",
    "the latter formulation turns out to be well captured by the bipartiteness ratio measure of @xmath9 , as in definition  ( [ def : bipar ] ) , the numerator involves all the edges that are _ not _ between @xmath13 and @xmath18 , and the dominator involves all the edges incident to @xmath17 .",
    "it is intuitive that the smaller the bipartiteness , the more likely it behaves like a dense bipartite subgraph . in real applications ,",
    "we suggest first detecting sets with small bipartiteness ratio ( using the algorithms below ) and then combining some heuristic algorithms ( such as the prune - filter technique used in @xcite ) to process the found sets and to better exploit the community structure of the web graph .",
    "thus , we will use the bipartiteness ratio ( abbreviated as _ b - ratio _ ) as a measure of a set being dense bipartite - like .",
    "we want to extract subgraphs with small b - ratio , which corresponds to good cyber - communities .",
    "furthermore , we are interested in finding _ small _ communities , which generally contains more interesting information than large communities and may be more substantial in large scale networks . for example , leskovec et al .",
    "investigate the community structure of many real networks by the _ conductance _ measure  @xcite , and they argue that large networks may have a core - periphery structure , where the periphery is composed of easily separable small communities and the nodes in the expander - like core are so intermingled that it is much harder to extract large communities ( if exist ) from it .    in order to make our algorithm practical , we would like to design a local algorithm to extract subgraphs with small b - ratio .",
    "a local algorithm , introduced by spielman and teng  @xcite , is one that given as input a vertex , it only explores a small portion of the graph and finds a subgraph with good property , which has found applications in graph sparsificasion , solving linear equations  @xcite , and designing near - linear time algorithms  @xcite .",
    "local algorithms have also shown to be both effective and efficient on real network data  ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "we give approximation , local algorithms and spectral characterization of finding the small subgraphs with small b - ratio , as we argued above , with the goal of extracting small cyber - communities . in the following",
    ", we will use the terminology of small dense bipartite - like subgraphs to indicate small subgraphs with small b - ratio .",

    "note that the approximation ratio does not depend on the size of the graph , since the algorithm is based on a spectral characterization of the b - ratio of the graph given by trevisan  @xcite  ( see lemma  [ lemma : tre ] ) , which is analogous to the cheeger s inequality for conductance ( see more discussions below ) .    by incorporating a truncation operation we are able to give a _ local algorithm _ for the dense bipartite subgraphs .",

    "furthermore , the running time of ` locdb ` is @xmath7 .",

    "for example , in theorem  [ thm : local ] , we can require @xmath37 and @xmath38 instead ( see the proof of the theorem ) .",
    "note that the local algorithm runs in time independent of the size of the graph and is sublinear time ( in the size of the input graph , denoted as @xmath39 ) when the size of the optimal set is sufficiently smaller than @xmath39 and the approximation ratio of the algorithm is almost optimal in that it almost matches the guarantee of trevisan s spectral inequality for the b - ratio .",
    "this algorithm also improves the work of the second author  @xcite , who gave a local algorithm for b - ratio guaranteeing that the output set has volume at most @xmath40 and b - ratio at most @xmath41 .    finally , as an application of the algorithm ` swpdb `",
    ", we give a spectral characterization of the small dense bipartite subgraph by relating the @xmath1th largest eigenvalue of the laplacian of @xmath16 to the b - ratio of some subsets with volume at most @xmath42 .",
    "more specifically , if we let @xmath43 be the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix @xmath44 of the graph @xmath16 , and define the _ dense bipartite profile _ of the graph as @xmath45 then our spectral characterization implies that @xmath46      our approximation algorithm is based on trevisan s spectral characterization of the b - ratio @xmath47 of the graph , which is the minimum b - ratio of all possible disjoint vertex subsets @xmath9 , that is , @xmath48 .",
    "recall that @xmath43 are the eigenvalues of @xmath44 . instead of working directly on @xmath44 , we study a closely related matrix @xmath49 , which we call the _ quasi - laplacian _ , that has the same spectra as @xmath44 .",

    "hence , the power method combined with the sweep process can find a subset with b - ratio close to @xmath47 .",
    "however , such a method does not give a useful volume bound on the output set .    in order to find _ small _ dense bipartite subgraphs",
    ", we sweep each of the vector @xmath56 and characterize @xmath56 in terms of the minimum of b - ratio of all the small sweep sets ( the sets found in the sweep process ) encountered in all the @xmath58 iterations .",
    "this is done by a _",

    ". using this property , we show inductively that if we choose @xmath64 for some vertex @xmath65 , @xmath66 can be upper bounded by a function in @xmath67 and the minimum b - ratio of all the sweep sets of volume at most @xmath68 for all @xmath69  ( see lemma  [ lemma : upper ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the graph contains a small dense bipartite subgraph @xmath9 of volume at most @xmath1 , we prove that the potential function also increases quickly in terms of @xmath70 and @xmath71  ( see lemma  [ lemma : lower ] ) , which will lead to the conclusion that at least one of the sweep set with volume at most @xmath68 has b - ratio `` close '' to @xmath71 by choosing proper @xmath68 in terms of @xmath1 and the starting vertex @xmath72 .    to give local algorithms that run in time independent of the size of the graph , we need to keep the support size of the vectors @xmath56 small in each iteration .",

    "let @xmath73 and iteratively define @xmath74 to be the truncation vector of @xmath75 .",
    "we show that both upper bound and lower bound on @xmath66 still approximately holds for @xmath76 , and thus prove the correctness of our local algorithm which sweeps all the vectors @xmath74 instead of @xmath56 .",
    "finally , we use a simple trace lower bound to serve as the lower bound for @xmath66 and obtain the spectral characterization of the dense bipartite profile .",
    "our work is closely related to a line of research on the _ conductance _ of a set @xmath0 , which is defined as @xmath77 kannan , vempala and veta  @xcite suggest using the conductance as a measure of a set being a general community ( in contrast of cyber - communities ) , since the smaller the conductance it , the more likely that the set is a community with dense intra - connections and sparse inter - connections . spielman and teng give the first local clustering algorithm to find subgraphs with small conductance by using the truncated random walk  @xcite .",
