    "photon pairs generated via the nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) can exhibit entanglement in multiple degrees of freedom : spectral , spatial , and polarization @xcite .",
    "entanglement arises from the multiple possibilities for satisfying energy and momentum conservation , as required by the parametric interaction process .",
    "spectral entanglement is exhibited equivalently in time or energy @xcite ; spatial entanglement may be manifested as entanglement in wavevector direction @xcite , transverse direction @xcite , orbital - angular - momentum ( oam ) @xcite , or spatial parity @xcite .",
    "a proper description of the quantum state of the photon pair ( biphoton ) requires a hilbert space that includes all of the pertinent degrees of freedom .",
    "one of these degrees of freedom may be arbitrarily chosen to distinguish the two photons , while the other two are used to describe the state .",
    "the term hyper - entanglement has been used to describe states defined over multiple degrees of freedom @xcite .    while the polarization variable is intrinsically binary , spectral and spatial variables are generally continuous .",
    "nevertheless , binary spectral or spatial degrees of freedom can be extracted by selection of a subspace of dimension two ( a qubit ) .",
    "examples are frequency selection by use of narrow spectral filters @xcite , direction selection by use of pinholes in the far field @xcite , and lower - order oam - mode selection by suppression of higher - order modes @xcite .",
    "another approach to binarization is based on constraining the parametric process in such a way that only two values of the continuous variable are permitted ; such configurations include narrowband spectral entanglement @xcite and type - ii noncollinear down - conversion in which only two directions ( as determined by intersecting rings ) are permitted @xcite .",
    "a third approach is to map the larger hilbert space onto a binary space , as in spatial - parity entanglement @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the generation of biphotons by means of spdc in a nonlinear waveguide .",
    "this configuration confines the photons to a single direction of propagation and discretizes the spatial degree of freedom to the waveguide spatial modes .",
    "for a two - mode waveguide , the spatial degree of freedom is binary , representing a modal qubit .",
    "the waveguide also supports two polarizations ( e.g. , te and tm in a one - dimensional geometry ) .",
    "moreover , the spectral distributions of the down - converted photons may be constrained to yield a pair of narrow spectral lines defining a spectral qubit , or alternatively , may be made more flexible so as to generate photon pairs with broad spectral entanglement ; these conditions are achieved by making use of periodic and linearly chirped poling of the nonlinear medium , respectively .",
    "in addition to the advantage of spatial binarization , the two - mode waveguide has the merit of combining a higher rate of biphoton generation , normally obtained in collinear degenerate bulk spdc , with the photon separability generally offered by a noncollinear configuration .",
    "moreover , processing of the generated biphotons for applications in quantum information @xcite is often facilitated by the use of guided - wave devices .    in this paper , we offer a comprehensive theoretical study of the properties and applications of modal , spectral , and polarization entanglement of biphotons generated via spdc in 1-d planar and 2-d circular waveguides . in particular , we consider biphotons generated via different types of interactions and with the use of a continuous wave ( cw ) pump .",

    "the region of overlap between the four spectra ( except for the degenerate case ) represents the spectral band over which a doubly entangled state can be obtained .",

    "the inherent phase mismatch in the process is corrected by modulating the nonlinear coefficient with poling periods ( spatial frequencies ) that are either uniform or linearly chirped . since the interaction is collinear within the waveguides ,",
    "modal entanglement can be used in place of directional entanglement to distinguish between the down - converted photons .",
    "spectral or polarization entanglement can therefore be generated with high efficiency and the entangled photons can be readily separated .",
    "we find that there is a tradeoff between long waveguide length to generate a high flux of photon pairs and short waveguide length to generate a smooth interference pattern with high visibility . in type-0 interactions",
    ", frequency can be used as a mode identifier rather than waveguide mode number , offering the possibility of using modal entanglement in place of polarization entanglement , which requires a type - ii interaction .",
