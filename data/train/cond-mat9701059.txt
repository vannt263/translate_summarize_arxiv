    "taking electron spin into account there are a total of @xmath5 degenerate states , and if all of these states are equivalent , in a sense made precise below , we can think of them as realizing the fundamental representation of the @xmath6 group .",
    "in other words , electrons placed in the shell can be considered as having @xmath7 different , but equivalent , flavors instead of just the ordinary two flavors of spin up and down .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath6 symmetry is _ not _ equivalent , in general , to the higher - spin representations of the usual @xmath1 group familiar from the quantum theory of angular momentum .",
    "rather , for @xmath8 , @xmath6 is a different and larger symmetry .",
    "ordinary atomic orbitals might seem like a good candidate but , for real atoms , the enlarged symmetry is broken down to the usual @xmath1 symmetry by electron - electron interactions which lift the degeneracy .",

    "electrons in a quantum dot are confined in a non - singular potential often described@xcite as a short square well in the @xmath16-direction and a simple parabola in the @xmath17 plane , @xmath18 , though our results do not depend on the detailed form of the potential as long as it has cylindrical symmetry . for the lowest mode in the z - direction ,",
    "the resulting harmonic oscillator eigenenergies are @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the radial and angular momentum quantum numbers .",

    "[ fig1 ] . apart from configuration splitting ( discussed below ) ,",

    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) is clear : conservation of the electron s orbital angular momentum around the @xmath16-axis , a consequence of the cylindrical symmetry of the confining potential , guarantees that transitions between different angular momentum states in adjacent dots , which would break the flavor symmetry , are forbidden .",

    "thus , @xmath30 is due almost entirely to the dependence of the electron - electron coulomb interaction on the shell configuration as described by hund s rules@xcite , which have been shown both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite to be directly applicable to semiconducting dots .",
    "the six configurations break up as : @xmath36 .",

    "because the coulomb interaction is long - ranged , these numbers are nearly independent of the confining potential ; indeed , @xmath47 also holds for real ( nearly spherical ) atoms . for an electron in a potential well of characteristic size @xmath42 we have : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and thus @xmath50 .",
