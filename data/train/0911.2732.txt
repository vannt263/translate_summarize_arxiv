    "the milky way is surrounded by large gaseous complexes observed at high velocities ( @xmath8 @xmath6 ) , known as hvcs .",
    "hvcs were traditionally regarded as neutral entities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this view has given way to one that recognizes the importance of an ionized component to many of these clouds thanks to high quality uv observations from _ hst _ and _ fuse _",
    "many of these hvcs are almost completely ionized and show absorption from the `` high ions '' o@xmath0vi , c@xmath0iv , and si@xmath0iv .",
    "these are therefore deemed highly ionized hvcs , although they often show absorption not only in the high ions , but also in the lower ions ( e.g. , c@xmath0ii , c@xmath0iii ) and even atoms ( h@xmath0i , o@xmath0i ) .",
    "a better designation would be multiphase hvcs or low h@xmath0i  column hvcs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the covering factor of these low h@xmath0i  column density hvcs is extremely high and much larger than that of the h@xmath0i  21-cm hvcs .",
    "_ fuse _  surveys of agns and qsos show that 6070%  ( perhaps even 85% ) of the high - latitude sky is covered by o@xmath0vi  hvcs , the majority of which ( @xmath975% ) have no h@xmath0i  emission counterpart @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that high - velocity si@xmath0iii  absorption has a detection rate of 8090%  at high latitude .",
    "these numbers are to be contrasted to the h@xmath0i  21-cm emission ( @xmath10h@xmath0i@xmath11 @xmath12 ) covering factor of @xmath937% @xcite .",
    "both galactic and larger - scale phenomena / structures have been invoked for the origin(s ) of these hvcs , including galactic feedback processes , disk - halo mass exchange ( e.g. , through the accretion of matter condensing from an extended corona ) , or the shock - heated warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) of the local group ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pros and cons of both theories have been discussed , but they are circumstantial and tentative , relying on assumptions of poorly - constrained quantities , such as metallicities and ionization conditions . as for the larger h@xmath0i  column hvcs ,",
    "the distance of the hvcs is the sole _ direct _",
    "test for these competing models .",
    "previous searches of these types of hvcs in the spectra of galactic halo stars have mostly failed @xcite , leading some support to the hypothesis that the highly ionized hvcs could be mainly associated with the whim of the local group rather than with some galactic - scale phenomena .",
    "however , most distance limits for highly ionized hvcs are not very constraining , as the stars in the @xcite survey are mostly significantly closer than those against which the higher column density h@xmath0i  hvcs have been detected , @xmath13 kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further for the stars at large @xmath14 in zsarg et al . , the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) levels were often not high enough and/or the stellar continua were too complicated to be able to reliably detect o@xmath0vi  at high velocity .    in @xcite",
    ", we revisited one of the zsarg et al .",
    "stars , the pagb star zng1 in the globular cluster ngc5904 ( @xmath15 kpc , see table  [ t - sum ] ) , with additional _ fuse _  and new _ hst_/stis ( e140 m ) observations , finding two highly ionized hvcs with no detected h@xmath0i  emission .",
    "this firmly demonstrated that some of these hvcs originate near the galactic disk .",
    "for sightlines passing through known large h@xmath0i  complexes ( e.g. , complex c , magellanic stream ) , highly ionized gas is found with similar kinematics as the neutral hvcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "kinematics and metallicity arguments also suggest some of low h@xmath0i  column hvcs observed toward the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) are due to galactic feedback occurring within the lmc @xcite .",
    "progress in determining the distances of the highly ionized hvcs seen in the galactic sky is now possible owing to the recent installation of the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) ( and repair of the space telescope imaging spectrograph , stis ) onboard of _ hst_. the high throughput of cos at medium resolution ( @xmath16 ) allows us to efficiently observe targets much fainter in the uv than previously , and hence observe more distant stars . in this letter",
    ", we report on the first observations from our cos program to search and characterize the high velocity n@xmath0v , c@xmath0iv , and si@xmath0iv  interstellar absorption in stars at large distances ( @xmath17 kpc , @xmath18 kpc ) . presently , four stars out of 24 have been observed . for two of them ( pg1708 + 142 , pg1704 + 222 , pagb stars at @xmath19 and 7 kpc , respectively )",
    ", no hvcs were detected .",
    "for another one the signal - to - noise was lower than expected and will need a closer inspection .",
    "however , in the cos spectrum of the fourth star ( hs1914 + 7139 , see table  [ t - sum ] ) , two hvcs at @xmath20 and @xmath7 @xmath6  are detected in c@xmath0iv , si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0ii , and other species .",
    "while the hvc at @xmath7 @xmath6  is detected in both absorption and h@xmath0i  21-cm emission and may be associated with the outer arm of the galaxy , the other hvc is only detected in absorption .",
    "thus , we have found another highly ionized hvc falling toward the sun and well within the milky way .",
    "as hvcs were only detected toward hs1914 + 7139 , we only summarize the data for this star . hs1914 +",
    "7139 is a ( possible runaway ) b2.5iv star ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 k ) with a projected rotational velocity @xmath23 @xmath6  and a radial velocity in the lsr frame of @xmath24 @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "it is located in the outer region of the galaxy at a distance from the sun @xmath25 kpc and height above the galactic plane @xmath26 kpc @xcite .",
    "the distance is accurate to @xmath920% and is based on detailed model of the stellar atmosphere .",
    "the large projected rotational velocity is ideal for interstellar studies removing the possibility that some of the narrow lines observed in the spectrum are stellar .",
    "the cos observations of hs1914 + 7139 were obtained on october 9 2009 using the gratings g130 m ( 11501450  ) and g160 m ( 14051775  ) .",
    "the exposures times for these two settings were 1.1 and 1.3 ks , respectively , giving s / n@xmath27 per resolution element .",
    "the uv flux of this star is @xmath28@xmath29 erg@xmath12s@xmath30@xmath30 , which would have required several tens of ks with stis e140 m to reach similar s / n .",
    "the data were collected in time - tag mode and were processed using the current version of calcos ( v2.11b ) available at the multi - mission archive at stsci ( mast ) . as the cos mission is still in its infancy , there are many aspects of the data calibration that are not completely optimal . for example , no flat field has been applied to the data and , based on profiles that are known to be fully saturated ( see fig .",
    "[ f - spectra ] ) , there seem to be issues with the background correction in some locations ( possibly owing to some contamination by scattered light ) .",
    "the post - launch line spread function ( lsf ) is also more complicated than the pre - launch lsf with the presence of broad non - gaussian wings , degrading somewhat the resolution of the cos g130 m and g185 m data @xcite .",
    "as we use several absorption lines as well as several transitions of a same ion , these adverse factors do not impede the reliable detection of the hvcs and the measurements of their velocities .",
    "however , estimates of the column densities are more subject to the lsf uncertainties , background subtraction , and flat fielding , and therefore column densities listed in this paper should be considered as preliminary .",
    "the stellar continuum was simple enough to be fitted with low - order legendre polynomials ( @xmath31 ) and in fig .",
    "[ f - spectra ] , we show some of the resulting normalized profiles . in this figure , we also show the 21-cm emission data from the 36  leiden - argentine - bonn survey ( lab , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the direction of hs1914 + 7134 .",
    "the absorption spectra show two high - velocity components at @xmath20 and @xmath7 @xmath6 , but only the latter component is seen in emission .",
    "the component at @xmath32 @xmath6  has absorption of c@xmath0ii , al@xmath0ii , si@xmath0ii , si@xmath0iii , si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , and o@xmath0i .",
    "all these species ( but the weaker line of the c@xmath0iv  doublet ) are detected at more than the 3@xmath33 level .",
    "the velocity is the average of @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the apparent optical depth ) for all the detected absorption lines ( except c@xmath0ii , si@xmath0ii  @xmath361193 , and si@xmath0iii  that are very strong lines where lower velocity components may contaminate the hvc component ) .",
    "the profiles were integrated from @xmath37 to @xmath38 @xmath6 .",
    "for the other component , the same species are observed as well as s@xmath0ii , fe@xmath0ii , n@xmath0i , and possibly n@xmath0v . integrating the profiles from @xmath39 @xmath6  to @xmath40 @xmath6   of n@xmath0i al@xmath0ii , si@xmath0ii   ( @xmath36@xmath361304 , 1526 ) , fe@xmath0ii , c@xmath0iv , si@xmath0iv , and n@xmath0v  yields @xmath41 @xmath6  for this hvc , within 1@xmath33 of the h@xmath0i   average emission velocity .",
    "hs1914 + 7139 is situated at a distance of 14.9 kpc from the sun and 6 kpc above the galactic plane .",
    "three main features of the milky way cross its path : orion spur at @xmath42 @xmath6 , the perseus arm at @xmath43 @xmath6 , and the outer arm at @xmath44 @xmath6 . based on the weak interstellar lines ( e.g. , s@xmath0ii",
    "@xmath361250 , ni@xmath0ii  @xmath361370 ) , the average lsr velocity of the low velocity component is @xmath45 @xmath6 , and hence the low velocity component mostly probes some relative nearby gas .    using the rotation curve from @xcite ,",
    "a velocity of about @xmath46 @xmath6  occur in gas at galactocentric distance @xmath47 kpc in the direction of hs1914 + 7139 if the gas corotates with the galaxy .",
    "the galactocentric distance of the star is @xmath48 kpc ( assuming @xmath49 kpc ) .",
    "hence combining the information from the kinematics and distance provides support for an origin of the component at @xmath7 @xmath6  from the outer arm , and this is therefore the first firm upper limit on the distance of the outer arm gas .",
    "we , however , note that both velocities and distance are also consistent with those of the nearby complex c ( @xmath50 kpc , thom et al . 2008 , and see also wakker et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "based on the rotation curve of the milky way , the gas moving at @xmath5 @xmath6  corresponds to @xmath51 kpc in a corotating disk / halo in the direction of hs1914 + 7139 .",
    "the limit from the distance of the star evidently rejects this hypothesis , implying that this component is a genuine hvc in the sense that its lsr velocity is inconsistent with a simple model of differential galactic rotation .",
    "this is therefore an highly ionized hvc that is much closer than its corotating distance implies .",
    "its high negative velocity implies it is plunging onto the milky way thick disk .",
    "we already noted above that the sightline to hs1914 + 7139 lies near complex c , but the absolute lsr velocity of the present hvc is substantially larger than those associated with complex c. searching for other observed sightlines near hs1914 + 7139 , we found 5 qsos / agns that are summarized in table  [ t - extra ] .",
    "all these lines of sight show both absorption at lsr velocities lower and greater than @xmath52 @xmath6 . for the absorption centered near @xmath46 @xmath6 ,",
    "sightlines with typically @xmath53 ( for @xmath54@xmath55 ) are related to the outer arm while hvcs at @xmath56 are associated with complex c. however , as @xcite also discussed , with the current observational evidence it is not clear if complex c and the outer arm gas are different entities or have a relationship , except for the h@xmath0i  maps that indicate that the outer arm seems to connect more smoothly to the galactic disk than complex c ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in what follows ( except otherwise stated ) , we focus solely on the hvcs at @xmath57 @xmath6  where little or no h@xmath0i  21-cm emission has been detected ( @xmath10h@xmath0i@xmath58 @xmath12 ) .",
    "preliminary apparent column densities toward hs1914 + 7139 for o@xmath0i  and si@xmath0ii  are : @xmath59si@xmath0ii@xmath60 , @xmath59o@xmath0i@xmath61 , giving @xmath62o@xmath0i / si@xmath0ii@xmath63 = -0.9 $ ] ( where @xmath64= \\log n(x)/n(y ) - \\log ( x / y)_\\odot $ ] and the solar abundances are from lodders et al . 2009 ) , i.e. the gas is dominantly ionized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using the results from @xcite , @xmath62o@xmath0i / si@xmath0ii@xmath63 \\simeq -0.53 $ ] toward 3c351 , again suggesting a large fraction of ionized gas .",
    "only o@xmath0vi  and c@xmath0iv  are detected toward h1821 + 643 @xcite , implying that the gas is highly ionized .",
    "for the other sightlines listed in table  [ t - extra ] , the presence of si@xmath0iii  or / and other higher ions also implies a large amount of ionized gas .",
    "so not only do the hvcs listed in table  [ t - extra ] and toward hs1914 + 7139 share similar velocities , but they all have low h@xmath0i  column densities and are largely ionized .",
    "this suggests they trace a common structure .",
    "+ 7139 places these hvcs at @xmath65 kpc and @xmath66 kpc .",
    "while the origin for these hvcs is still uncertain ( see below ) , they can not be part of the whim at very large distances from the milky way .",
    "@xcite derived a metallicity for the hvc toward 3c351 @xmath62o / h@xmath63\\ga -1.2 $ ] dex solar based on a comparison of o@xmath0i  and h@xmath0i .",
    "they denominated this hvc the high - velocity ridge ( hvr ) and argued the hvr could be the leading edge of complex c that is interacting with the lower halo of the milky way .",
    "this would explain the ionized nature of the hvc , which is expected according to recent hydrodynamical simulations for a hvc moving in a hot halo and approaching the galactic plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the distance of hs1914 + 7139 is consistent with this hypothesis , providing some support to this idea .",
    "however , several studies suggest a slight gradient in @xmath67 from @xmath68 to about @xmath69 dexkpc@xmath30 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could accommodate low metallicity at large distances .",
    "there is , however , a large uncertainty in the gradient and how it varies with the galactic longitude . based on chemical evolution models and abundance measurements , @xcite found that the lowest @xmath70 $ ] has a mean and a deviation of @xmath71 dex at @xmath72 kpc , which does not favor a galactic fountain phenomenon in the outer region of the milky way if the overall metallicity of the hvcs is low ( @xmath73 dex solar ) .    in summary ,",
    "these early _ hst_/cos results have successfully constrained the distance of two multiphase hvcs toward the direction @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "one is related to the outer arm of the milky way and the other one traces infalling gas onto the milky way .",
    "it is too early to conclude if all the highly ionized hvcs are linked to galactic phenomena rather than the local group , but the two detections of highly ionized hvcs in very different regions of the galaxy ( central and outer regions , see table  [ t - sum ] ) show that at least some of these low @xmath10h@xmath0i@xmath74 hvcs are near the milky way and associated with infalling gas ( likely from a galactic foutain or accretion of matter condensing from the galactic corona ) .",
    "we note that so far only negative high velocities have been detected in spectra of stars , and it remains to be seen if highly ionized hvcs with positive velocities are found at @xmath7520 kpc from the milky way .",
