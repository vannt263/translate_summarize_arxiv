    "most of the mass energy of the universe consists of at least two unknown but observationally substantiated materials ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . while there is significant uncertainty as to what the `` dark energy '' that makes up @xmath7 of the universe might be ( for a review , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , there are a number of attractive candidates for the @xmath8 of the universe made of dark matter .",
    "a popular class of dark matter candidate is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , which includes the supersymmetric neutralino and the universal extra - dimensions kaluza - klein photon @xcite .",
    "wimps are appealing because they appear naturally in extensions to the standard model ( sm ) of physics , are thermally produced in the early universe in the quantity required by observations , and allow the large - scale structure of the universe to evolve in a manner that appears consistent with observations ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there are specific predictions on small scales , too .",
    "the relatively large mass of wimps ( @xmath9 gev ) imply that thermal decoupling occurs when the wimps are nonrelativistic ( `` cold '' ) and with a high phase - space density .",
    "the low speeds in combination with the typically weak scattering cross sections mean that only the smallest - scale perturbations are washed out by the time wimps kinetically decouple from light sm particles @xcite .",
    "hence , dark matter halos should be extremely dense at their centers and should exist down to @xmath10 earth mass scales .",
    "moreover , dark matter density perturbations should evolve as a collisionless , pressureless fluid .    however , it is quite possible that dark matter consists of something other than standard wimps .",
    "first , while observations are consistent with cold dark matter ( cdm ) on large scales ( length scales of @xmath11 s of mpc ) , these observations do not _ require _ a purely cold dark matter model .",
    "second , the interpretation of data on smaller scales is less clear or is nonexistent ( e.g. , refs .",
    "third , wimps are by no means the only attractive class of particle candidates for dark matter .",
    "there are a number of theories in which the large - scale successes of cold dark matter are produced but deviate at the small scales where observations either do not exist or are more difficult to interpret @xcite .",
    "in this work , i consider observational constraints on a phenomenological decaying dark matter model in which a parent particle @xmath12 experiences two - body decay of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the stable daughter dark matter particle and @xmath15 is a massless ( or nearly massless ) particle with extremely weak to nonexistent couplings with sm particles .",
    "the @xmath14 particle is only slightly less massive than the parent particle @xmath12 , such that @xmath16 for small @xmath17 , the recoiling particle @xmath14 receives a nonrelativistic speed @xmath18 in the center - of - mass frame of the parent @xmath12 particle .",
    "i consider large decay times @xmath19 s , such that decays occur after the first dark matter halos form in the early universe , making this model similar to that considered in snchez - salcedo ( 2003 ) @xcite .",
    "such a model may arise in `` hidden sector '' theories , in which the sm does not interact with hidden parallel particle sectors ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for examples of hidden sector theories ) .",
    "moreover , i assume that the parent @xmath12 particles are massive and thermally produced , such that the linear matter power spectrum in the early universe should resemble that of cdm .",
    "since this model does not produce sm particles and the decay times are long , previously published constraints on decaying dark matter do not apply @xcite . since the decay times i consider are long enough that dark matter halos should have formed , and formed with cdm - like properties , the main effect of decays is either to inject kinetic energy into or eject particles from existing dark matter halos .",
    "the result of these effects is a change in the dark matter density profile in halos and halo mass loss .",
    "thus , i consider observational constraints on the model from the structure and abundances of dark matter halos . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vir ] , i relate the two free parameters of the dark matter model , @xmath0  and @xmath1 , to the typical speeds and time scales of particles in halos , and show how i expect halos to respond to decays as a function of the decay parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs ] , i describe the types of observations that may constrain this decaying dark matter model , and how to translate observations into constraints on the decay parameters via the mapping in sec .",
    "[ sec : vir ] .",
    "i calculate constraints in those instances in which they can be calculated semianalytically .",
    "i summarize and discuss the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the phenomenological decaying dark matter model is parameterized by just two numbers : the decay time @xmath1 and the kick speed ( alternatively , the fractional mass difference between dark matter particles ) @xmath0 .",
    "the effects of decay on dark matter halos as a function of these parameters depends on halo properties , namely the typical dynamical time ( @xmath20 ) and the typical speed of dark matter particles in the halo .",
    "the typical speed of dark matter particles in the halo is of order the virial speed , @xmath21 where the halo virial mass @xmath22   is defined as the mass enclosed within the virial radius @xmath23 in which the average mass density is equal to the spherical collapse density @xmath24 , @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the mean mass density in the universe . in a @xmath27cdm universe , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is fraction of the critical density @xmath31 in the form of matter ( @xmath32 ) @xcite .",
    "i take the typical dynamical time of a dark matter particle in a halo to be the crossing time at the half - mass radius of the halo .",
    "i do not use the crossing time at the virial radius because @xmath33 which is the same for all halos .",
    "i must select a halo model in order to calculate the dynamical time as defined as the crossing time at the half - mass radius .",
    "dissipationless cosmological simulations of cold dark matter alone ( without baryons ) show that dark matter halo profiles are well described by the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xmath34 on observable scales ( radii from galactic centers @xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "the scale radius @xmath36 can be related to the @xmath23 by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the halo concentration .",
    "the concentration is expected to be a function of the formation time of the halo , and is thus in general a function of the mass of the halo @xcite .",
    "the scale density @xmath39 can be related to virial quantities , @xmath40    if @xmath41 , which is expected for virialized halos , then the half - mass radius @xmath42 the typical dark matter particle speed at such a radius is typically @xmath43 which is similar to the virial speed .",
    "thus , the typical crossing speed at the half - mass radius , and hence , the typical dynamical time , is @xmath44 in cdm , a typical galaxy ( @xmath45 ) has @xmath46 , yielding @xmath47 and @xmath48 myr ; a large galaxy cluster has @xmath49 and @xmath50 , corresponding to @xmath51 and @xmath52 gyr ; and the ultra - faint dwarf galaxies in the local group likely have virial masses @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) @xcite .",
    "the concentration of those galaxies is unknown , but taking @xmath55 leads to @xmath56 myr .",
    "another interesting time scale is the crossing time at the scale radius , @xmath57 , since this corresponds to the region of the halo at which the profile transitions from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "the `` scale time '' @xmath57 is @xmath60 myr for an ultra - faint dwarf galaxy halo , @xmath61 myr for a typical galaxy halo , and @xmath62 myr for the cluster - sized halo .",
    "this highlights the point that although i choose one time scale to parameterize the dynamical time in a halo , there is actually a diversity of dynamical times within a halo .",
    "now that i have parameterized the time scales and speeds of dark matter particles in halos , i will classify the effects of dark matter decays are on halos as a function of the decay parameters with respect to the halo parameters . at the present",
    ", i will ignore cosmological accretion onto halos , and consider the halos to be isolated and in equilibrium .    _ case 1 _ ( @xmath63)this is a regime",
    "in which the decay time is long relative to the dynamical time of the halo , and the kick speed is high .",
    "the limit of relativistic kicks was studied in refs . @xcite and @xcite in other contexts , but even for nonrelativistic kicks greater than @xmath64 , the @xmath14 particles are ejected from the system .",
    "the decays do not directly inject kinetic energy into the bound halo , as they will in the following cases , because the decay products @xmath14 will be unbound to the halo .    in cases in which the time scale for change in the gravitational potential is significantly longer than the dynamical time",
    ", particles on regular orbits should conserve adiabatic invariants .",
    "this is useful because , if the halo is quasi - static , the distribution function ( df ) of dark matter particles is a function of adiabatic invariants .",
    "the mass density in the halo thus be calculated using this df if the gravitational potential of the halo is known ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the simplified case of a spherically symmetric potential with all particles initially on circular orbits , the gravitational potential , and",
    "hence , the dark matter density of the halo may easily be found as a function of the fraction of particles that have been ejected from the halo .",
    "the approximation of dark matter particles on circular orbits is not as unrealistic as one might expect ; cosmological simulations of dark matter halos show that there is not a significant phase - space density of highly radial orbits , except in the outskirts of the halo @xcite .",
    "this approximation was used in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite , and i show analytically how the density profile of dark matter halos changes as a function of the fraction of the @xmath12 particles that have decayed , @xmath65 .",
    "if the angular momentum of particles is conserved , then the initial and final mass distributions are related as @xmath66 since the specific angular momentum of particles on circular orbits is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the mass enclosed within radius @xmath69 .",
    "here , i denotes the initial halo properties , and f denotes halo properties after a fraction @xmath65 of @xmath12 particles have decayed .",
    "if the @xmath12 particles are initially on circular orbits , then their orbits do not cross , allowing for the following relation : @xmath70 inserting this equation into eq .",
    "( [ eq : j_conservation ] ) , i find that the initial and final particle radii are related as @xmath71 such that @xmath72 this changes the mass density of the @xmath12 particles in the following way .",
    "the density is @xmath73 in the case of an nfw halo [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : nfw ] ) ] , this implies @xmath74 ^ 2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the halo retains its nfw form , but with scale radius @xmath75 and with a decreased scale density @xmath76    thus , if @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the _ shape _ of the dark matter halo will be unchanged , but the scale radius will increase , and the mass density and total virial mass will decrease . note that these results are independent of @xmath0   beyond the fact @xmath0   must be large enough to unbind any @xmath14 particle from the halo .",
    "( @xmath79)in this regime , the halo is slowly evolving as a function of time , but the kick speeds are small . unlike case 1 ( above ) , it is difficult to calculate analytically the general behavior of the halo .",
    "although the decay time scale is long enough that the gravitational potential of the halo should evolve fairly slowly , the @xmath14 daughter particles largely stay within the halo , making it difficult to estimate changes to the adiabatic invariants or to the gravitational potential .    however , there are a few general predictions one may make .",
    "first , since self - gravitating systems have negative heat capacity , any slow injection of kinetic energy into the halo causes the halo to expand and for the typical particle energy to become less negative ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "second , there will be some mass loss as some initially loosely bound particles will decay to particles that are no longer bound to the halo , and more may be lost as the gravitational potential responds to the kinetic energy injection resulting from decays .",
    "the consequences of these effects are to drive down the central halo density , the total virial mass , and the typical particle speed .",
    "the effects will be larger for high @xmath0  and shorter @xmath1 , and will be most pronounced at the halo centers ( where the typical particle speed is smaller ) . for small @xmath0  or large @xmath1 , there should hardly be a change to halo properties .",
    "in general , the behavior of decays in this regime must be examined either by solutions to the boltzmann and poisson equations or by @xmath3-body simulations .",
    "_ case 3 _ ( @xmath80)this regime , in which the decay time is less than the dynamical time , can be thought of as being similar to the case of instantaneous decay . in this particular case ,",
    "the kick speed is also quite high . in general , most , if not all , of the mass in the halo will be ejected .",
    "if any mass remains in the halo , the system will settle to a new equilibrium within several dynamical times , but it is not clear what the structure of that halo will be . in the absence of accretion ,",
    "the structure of the halo is fixed for the rest of time .",
    "again , quantitative predictions for this regime require @xmath3-body simulations .",
    "( @xmath81)in this case , the velocity perturbations are small and occur in one short epoch .",
    "this is analogous to the case of high - speed galaxy encounters . and like noncatastrophic high - speed galaxy encounters",
    ", we can calculate one post - encounter ( or post - decay ) property of the halo : the total kinetic energy in the virial radius .",
    "if a halo is initially in virial equilibrium , the total energy @xmath82 is related to the kinetic energy @xmath83 by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath84 if no particles are ejected as a result of the decays , the total kinetic energy injected in the halo is @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the final energy will be @xmath86 and after the halo has settled into virial equilibrium again after a few dynamical times , the kinetic energy will be @xmath87 once again , the negative heat capacity of self - gravitating systems means that the net effect of injection of kinetic energy into a halo is a decrease in the total kinetic energy of the system .",
    "if @xmath0  is a significant fraction of @xmath64 , this approximation for the final kinetic energy becomes worse , as decays result in mass loss from the system , both directly as individual @xmath14 particles are created on unbound orbits , and indirectly due to the rapidly changing gravitational potential .",
    "even if the final energy of the halo is known , the form of the gravitational potential ( and hence , the density distribution ) is not without the help of @xmath3-body simulations .",
    "however , just as in case 2 , we predict that the halo will become less dense , and that the mass loss and density changes will be more extreme for larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "there are several points to make about these regimes .",
    "first , given that galaxies and clusters span a large range of halo mass , a fixed @xmath1 and @xmath88  will place a low mass halo in a different regime than a high mass halo .",
    "for example , if @xmath89 gyr and @xmath90 km s@xmath91 , ultra - faint dwarf galaxies will be in case 1 .",
    "they will have disintegrated by the present since particles will be ejected from the halo on time scales far less than the age of the universe , @xmath92 gyr .",
    "however , the halo of an typical ( @xmath93 ) galaxy will be in the regime of case 2 , and the halo of massive cluster will be case 4 . secondly , there will be a differentiation in cases throughout a single halo since dynamical time scales are much shorter deep within the halo",
    ". a halo may be in case 2 in the interior , but in case 4 near the edge of the halo .",
    "last , while one can make general predictions for the behavior of halos for decays in each regime , quantitative predictions largely require @xmath3-body simulations , which we perform and analyze in another paper @xcite .",
    "summary of the changes to dark matter halos due to late - time decays , as a function of @xmath0/@xmath64  and @xmath1/@xmath20 . in the region",
    "marked `` cdm - like '' , decays have little effect on halos , and so halos should resemble those produced by cdm .",
    "the area marked `` catastrophic '' is the region of parameter space in which halos are almost completely destroyed as a result of decays .",
    "the middle region labeled `` potentially interesting '' indicates the part of parameter space that is not ruled out as catastrophic , nor is it likely to produce halos that exactly resemble those predicted by cdm.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : vir ] .",
    "the region marked `` cdm - like '' denotes the @xmath77 and @xmath94 parts of parameter space in which we expect either almost no decays or almost no kinetic energy injection in the halo . for this region of parameter space , the halo properties will be nearly indistinguishable from the case of no decays .",
    "the region marked `` catastrophic '' has extended beyond the parts of parameter space of case 3 to lower @xmath0   and higher @xmath1 , since @xmath95 can still induce significant mass loss , and decays on time scales of a few dynamical times can affect the halo as it settles into its new equilibrium .",
    "the region marked `` potentially interesting '' includes bits of cases 1 , 2 , and 4 , and represents the part of parameter space whose effects on halo structure need to be explored with @xmath3-body simulations and constrained with observations . in the next section ,",
    "i show how to relate observational constraints to fig .",
    "[ fig : vir ] , and define regions of @xmath2 parameter space allowed by observations and which need to be better understood with simulations .",
    "there are a number of probes of the distribution of matter in the universe . in this section ,",
    "i describe a set of probes from which constraints on decaying dark matter are easiest to infer , and calculate constraints for case 1-type decays .",
    "we consider observational constraints on case 2 , 3 , and 4 decays in other work @xcite .",
    "the probes i consider are the cluster mass function ( sec .",
    "[ sec : obs : cluster ] ) , galaxy clustering ( sec . [ sec : obs : pofk ] ) , the existence of small dark matter halos ( sec .",
    "[ sec : obs : small ] ) and the mass - concentration relation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : obs : mc ] ) .",
    "the cluster mass functions are relatively clean for decaying dark matter studies for both observational and theoretical reasons .",
    "individual cluster halo masses are substantially easier to determine than the halos of individual galaxies , and the assignment of a cluster of galaxies to a single dark matter halo is unambiguous . moreover , since most of the energy in decays goes to nonrelativistic massive particles , the background evolution of the universe is unchanged .",
    "hence , the growth function , which depends only on redshift and the background cosmology in a @xmath27cdm universe , is unchanged relative to @xmath27cdm predictions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the relativistic case , in which the background evolution does change ) @xcite .",
    "thus , main change to the cluster mass function relative to that predicted from @xmath27cdm models occur as a result mass loss from the halos due to decay .",
    "this makes the mass functions simple to interpret with respect to @xmath27cdm predictions .",
    "there are two different ways to use the cluster mass function to constrain the decaying dark matter parameter space .",
    "i will show how the @xmath5 mass function ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent observations and mass - function calculations ) constrains the decay time @xmath1 in the case 1 virial regime .",
    "this method is easy to generalize to other parts of decay parameter space .",
    "second , i show how upcoming cluster surveys ( e.g. , sunyaev - zeldovich observations in the microwave bands @xcite ) that are sensitive to the redshift evolution of the cluster mass function can be used to constrain decays .",
    "cluster mass functions derived from x - ray and optical surveys of the local universe have been used to constrain @xmath30 and @xmath96 , the rms amplitude of fluctuations in the linear density field at @xmath5 if smoothed on 8 @xmath97 mpc scales , where @xmath98 is the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "the constraints on @xmath30 and @xmath96 from the local cluster mass function are consistent with those found with other cosmological probes , including the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , the lyman - alpha forest @xcite , weak - lensing power spectra , and galaxy clustering @xcite .",
    "the consistency of the constraints on @xmath30 and @xmath96 from different epochs constrains decaying dark matter for the following reason .",
    "the standard lore of halo formation is that halos form when the amplitude of the density perturbation ( alternatively , the amplitude of the linear matter power spectrum ) smoothed on a distance scale @xmath99 ( or alternatively , a mass scale @xmath100 ) , exceeds the overdensity required for halo collapse @xcite .",
    "the halo number density @xmath101 is then related to the volume of space in which the overdensity exceeds the collapse density . if the smoothed amplitude of fluctuations is small , then there are few virialized halos of that given mass ; if the amplitude is large , then there are many halos of a given mass",
    ". the amplitude of the linear matter power spectrum is controlled by the initial amplitude of fluctuations from inflation as well as @xmath30 , but is usually parameterized in terms of @xmath96 and @xmath30 .",
    "the number density of clusters , the rarest of virialized objects , is quite sensitive to @xmath96 and @xmath30 , with more clusters expected in a high-@xmath96 , high-@xmath30 cosmology .",
    "a @xmath102 change in @xmath96 can yield order - unity changes in the cluster halo number density ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . decays cause mass loss in halos , thus reducing the number density of halos above fixed mass .",
    "if one were to infer @xmath27cdm parameters from the local cluster mass function if dark matter were decaying , one would infer artificially small values of @xmath96 and @xmath30 relative to what one would infer from probes of earlier epochs ( e.g. , the cmb and lyman - alpha forest ) . the fact that @xmath96 and @xmath30 inferred from the local cluster mass function are similar to those inferred from other probes limits decay parameter space , although the error bars for the cluster mass functions ( and hence , those for the inferred values of @xmath96 and @xmath30 ) are quite large @xcite .",
    "one can estimate conservative limits on decay parameter space using the following method .",
    "since decays lower the inferred @xmath96 and @xmath30 of clusters relative to those inferred from the cmb , i find which combination of @xmath0   and @xmath1 would cause the 2-@xmath103 upper limits on @xmath30 and @xmath96 from the cmb to yield a @xmath5 cluster mass function that is barely consistent to the 2-@xmath103 lower limits on those parameters . in the instance of case 1 of sec .",
