    "the term ` narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ' ( nls1s ) was coined by osterbrock & pogge ( 1985 ) who noted the overall peculiar optical emission - line spectra of seyfert galaxies with narrow balmer lines ( see pogge , these proceedings ) .",
    "follow - up studies of their radio emission and optical polarization properties did not reveal anything outstanding .",
    "the first hint for their remarkable x - ray properties was found by stephens ( 1989 ) who noted , based on _ einstein _ data , that `` x - ray selection may be an efficient way to find nls1s . '' this conclusion was much strengthened by puchnarewicz et al .",
    "( 1992 ) who found that @xmath3% of their _ einstein _ ultrasoft survey agns were nls1s , thus establishing that nls1s have steeper than usual soft x - ray spectra .",
    "this result was further refined by laor et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who noted a remarkably strong correlation between the h@xmath1 fwhm and the _ rosat _ @xmath4 in a sample of 10 pg quasars ( @xmath5 = 0.842 , pr=@xmath6 ) .",
    "this result was further strengthened when the complete sample of all 23 @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9  @xmath10 , pg quasars was analyzed ( laor et al .",
    "1997a , hereafter l97 ; @xmath5= 0.79 , pr= @xmath11 ) .",
    "boller , brandt & fink ( 1996 ) studied a large sample of nls1s with _",
    "rosat _ and noted the clear absence of broad line agns with a steep @xmath4 .",
    "however , they found a much larger scatter in the h@xmath1 fwhm vs. @xmath4 relation .",
    "in particular , some of their nls1s show normal @xmath4 values , unlike the sample of l97 where all narrow - line quasars display steep @xmath4 values . this difference",
    "most likely results from the large luminosity range of the agns in the boller et al .",
    "in particular , a plot of @xmath4 vs. @xmath12 for the boller et al . sample ( using the data in their table 1 ) reveals a clear trend of flattening of @xmath4 with decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "all the flat ( @xmath13 ) nls1s in the boller et al .",
    "sample have low luminosity ( @xmath14  erg  s@xmath15 ) , and all their luminous agns ( @xmath16  erg  s@xmath15 ) are steep ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus , the boller et al .",
    "sample indicates that a significant h@xmath1 fwhm vs. @xmath4 correlation appears in bright agns , and not when lower luminosity seyferts are included , consistent with the strong correlation in the laor et al .",
    "sample which includes only @xmath7 pg quasars .",
    "the h@xmath1 fwhm vs. @xmath4 correlation thus involves luminosity as well .",
    "the luminosity dependence can be understood if the primary driver of this correlation is @xmath2 , rather than just the h@xmath1 fwhm ( see  2 ) .",
    "it will be interesting to explore if lower luminosity agns do follow an h@xmath1 fwhm vs. @xmath4 correlation , but offset towards flatter @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 vs. h@xmath1 fwhm correlation is remarkably strong . excluding luminosity luminosity correlations , it is the strongest of the 294 different correlations measured by l97 (  3.1 there )",
    ". why should the 0.22  kev continuum slope , most likely generated by the inner accretion disk ( @xmath18 ) , have anything to do with the width of the balmer lines produced in the broad line region ( blr , @xmath19 ) ?",
    "the strength of this correlation suggests that both parameters are controlled mostly by a single physical parameter .",
    "what is this parameter ?",
    "first , what is the width of the balmer lines telling us ? as discussed in various papers ( e.g. puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 ; laor et al .",
    "1994 ; boller et al .",
    "1996 ) , there are three plausible explanations : 1 .",
    "the blr velocity distribution is anisotropic , and in nls1s we have a face - on view of a flattened blr .",
    "the distance of the blr from the center is non - uniform , and in nls1s it may be larger than usual .",
    "the black hole mass is non - uniform , and in nls1s it may be lower than usual .",
    "what is the steepness of @xmath4 telling us ?",
    "white , fabian & mushotzky ( 1984 ) , and more recently pounds , done & osborne ( 1995 ) , noted a possible analogy of agns to galactic black hole candidates , where @xmath4 becomes steeper in their ` high state . '",
    "pounds et al . therefore suggested that nls1s , are ` high state , ' or high @xmath2 agns",
    "this suggestion basically overlaps explanation # 3 above for the narrow h@xmath1 .",
    "a narrow h@xmath1 implies a low @xmath20 , therefore a high @xmath2 , and therefore a steep @xmath4 .    why should the h@xmath1 fwhm be so strongly tied to @xmath20",
    "this can be understood with the following two assumptions : 1 .",
    "the blr velocity field is dominated by gravity , i.e. @xmath21 ( see recent evidence in peterson & wandel 1999 ) .",
    "the size of the blr is set by the bolometric luminosity , specifically @xmath22  pc , where @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 dependence is indirectly inferred by the weak , if any , dependence of the blr clouds density and ionization on luminosity , and it is expected theoretically if the gas in agns is dusty ( netzer & laor 1993 ) . it is experimentally verified in reverberation mappings of agns ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , though apparently with a somewhat steeper slope of @xmath25 ) . combining the two expressions for @xmath20 and @xmath26",
    "gives @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , and therefore @xmath29 ( laor 1998 ) .",
    "luminous agns with narrow h@xmath1 thus have particularly high @xmath2 , but low luminosity seyferts with a similar h@xmath1 width , will have a lower @xmath2 .",
    "this may explain why low luminosity nls1s in the boller et al .",
    "sample do not have a steep @xmath4 , they may simply not have a high @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath2 interpretation thus seems to provide a very appealing explanation for the h@xmath1 fwhm vs. @xmath4 correlation .",
    "but , how reliable is the @xmath30 determination ?",
    "this mass estimate has been around for many years ( e.g. dibai 1981 ; wandel & yahil 1985 ; padovani & rafanelli 1988 ; peterson et  al .",
    "1998 ) , but it was generally viewed as highly uncertain .",
    "possible problems include : 1 .",
    "@xmath31 is determined through reverberation mostly in agns with `` normal '' @xmath32 .",
    "do nls1s simply have a larger @xmath31 ?",
    "2 . @xmath33 may be anisotropic .",
    "is @xmath26 in nls1s larger because the blr sees a brighter ionizing continuum than we do ?",
    "@xmath34 may be anisotropic .",
    "is the blr in nls1s simply seen ` face - on ' ?",
    "4 . @xmath34 may be dominated by radiation or magnetic pressure , and thus not related to @xmath20 .    given this host of possible systematic effects , one can not attach a reliable error bar to @xmath30 ( though recent reverberation studies suggest that problems # 1 and # 4 may not be significant ) .",
    "below , i describe recent new evidence that provides an indirect check on the @xmath30 estimate , and indicates it is most likely accurate to within a factor of 23 .",
    "magorrian et al . ( 1998 , and references therein ) have recently obtained two outstanding results : 1 .",
    "most ( possibly all ) early type galaxies host a massive dark object ( mdo ) at their center , most likely a massive black hole .",
    "the mdo mass is correlated with the bulge mass .",
    "these results , if true , have a fundamental impact on our understanding of quasar and galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "the magorrian et al .",
    "study is based on hst observations of an unbiased sample of 36 nearby early type galaxies ( i.e. their selection was independent of a  priori knowledge about core kinematics ) .",
    "they combined ground based spectroscopy with hst imaging and constructed simplified kinematic models with a constant @xmath35 plus a spatially unresolved mdo .",
    "their simplified model allowed an acceptable fit in 32 galaxies . in 31 of these galaxies",
    "a mdo is allowed ( best fit @xmath36 ) , and in 26 it is required ( at @xmath37% significance level ) .",
    "the @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 correlation found in this study can not be a selection effect since 31/32 mdos were detected . a study which is based on a compilation of all published results",
    "would be strongly biased , as non detections are generally not published , and the minimum detectable @xmath38 is strongly correlated with @xmath39 .",
    "this bias is not present in the magorrian et al .",
    "study , and unless their @xmath38 values are wrong , the correlation they find is highly significant .",
    "ongoing spectroscopy with hst should significantly improve the kinematic constraints on @xmath38 .",
    "how is all of the above related to quasars ?",
    "the first hint came from the study of mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) , who found that there is an upper limit for the quasar luminosity at a given host luminosity , a limit which grows roughly linearly with the host luminosity .",
    "mcleod ( 1997 ) speculated that this limit may be @xmath40 , if @xmath20 has an upper limit in a host of a given luminosity , and if this limit increases with the host luminosity .",
    "do quasar hosts follow the @xmath20 vs. @xmath39 correlation suggested for normal galaxies ? to explore this , one needs a high - quality sample of quasars ( uniform , well defined , complete ) , with a high quality data set on their host luminosity .",
    "the closest we could get to this ideal is with the pg sample .",
    "bahcall et al . ( 1997 ) and kirhakos et al . ( 1999 ) provide careful and systematic measurements of the host luminosities of 23 quasars imaged with hst , of which 15 are pgs .",
    "boroson & green ( 1992 , bg92 ) gives high quality spectroscopy , and neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1987 ) provide well calibrated spectrophotometry .",
    "combining @xmath33 and @xmath32 provides @xmath30 .",
    "figure 1 presents the bulge luminosity vs. @xmath20 relation for these 15 pg quasars , together with the distribution of the nearby galaxies from magorrian et al .",
    "the quasar correlation is highly significant ( @xmath41 ) ; it also overlaps the distribution of nearby galaxies , and it indicates a non - linear @xmath20 vs. @xmath39 relation .",
    "a least - squares fit to the quasars gives @xmath42(bulge)@xmath43 , which implies @xmath44 , unlike the linear relation proposed by magorrian et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that the three most accurate @xmath20 determinations , m  87 , ngc  4258 , and the galaxy , agree well with the non - linear quasar relation , as does the only nls1 in the bahcall et al .",
    "sample , nab  0205 + 024 .",
    "the overlap of the pg quasar and the magorrian et al .",
    "galaxy distributions in fig.1 is remarkable given the fact that these are _ apparently unrelated _ types of objects , and that one is using _ completely different _ methods to measure @xmath20 .",
    "this overlap suggests that the @xmath45 estimate in quasars is probably accurate to a factor @xmath46 , and provides the first indirect check for @xmath45 .",
    "is @xmath20 directly related to some of the peculiar emission properties of nls1s ?",
    "one of the outstanding properties of many nls1s is their rapid and large amplitude soft x - ray variability ( e.g. boller et  al . 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "more systematic results came from the pilot study of fiore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who observed a complete and unbiased small sample of six pg quasars which included the three narrowest and three broadest h@xmath1 quasars in the l97 sample .",
    "all the steep quasars varied significantly on a @xmath47@xmath48  s timescale , while none of the flat @xmath4 quasars did ( both groups varied similarly on the @xmath49  s timescale ) , hinting at a strong correlation between x - ray variability and h@xmath1 fwhm .    the variability of a much larger and heterogeneous sample of agns was explored by turner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on a @xmath50  s timescale .",
    "they recovered the well known variability vs. luminosity correlation , but discovered there is a much tighter correlation of the variability amplitude with the h@xmath1 fwhm .",
    "a qualitatively similar result was obtained by leighly ( 1999 ) , who found that nls1s obey the variability amplitude vs. @xmath33 relation of broad - line agns , but were displaced upwards towards larger variability amplitudes at a given @xmath33 .",
    "what is the underlying physical parameter which controls these trends ? is it @xmath20 , or possibly @xmath2 ?",
    "comparison with gbhcs provides some clues .",
    "gbhcs can vary significantly down to ms timescales , and most likely harbor a few @xmath51 black holes .",
    "seyfert galaxies can vary significantly down to ks timescale , and most likely harbour @xmath52 black holes . based on this simple empirical fact",
    ", it appears plausible that the variability timescale ( at a fixed variability amplitude ) is roughly proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "this can occur if flux modifying disturbances have some characteristic velocity in the x - ray emitting region ( independent of absolute luminosity ) , and if the size of this region scales with mass ( i.e. it is fixed in units of @xmath53 ) .",
    "turner et al .",
    "provide @xmath54 and h@xmath1 fwhm for all their objects .",
    "i used these parameters to obtain a rough estimate of @xmath20 and @xmath2 . for objects with more than one value of @xmath55 in the turner et al .",
    "paper , i used a mean value ( this reduces the scatter ) .",
    "figure  2 presents plots of the correlations of @xmath55 with @xmath54 , h@xmath1 fwhm , and with the combinations roughly proportional to @xmath20 and @xmath2 ( spearman @xmath56 and probabilities are indicated in each panel ) .",
    "the correlation of @xmath55 with @xmath20 is the strongest ( significance level @xmath57 ) , which suggests that @xmath20 is the underlying physical parameter which drives the observed dependence of the x - ray variability on luminosity and on line width .",
    "agns may have a universal power spectrum density ( psd ) of x - ray fluctuations , and @xmath20 may just set the timescale at a given amplitude ( hayashida , these proceedings ) .",
    "interestingly , there appears to be a certain @xmath2 above which the mean @xmath55 increases by a facor of @xmath58 .",
    "this may reflect a qualitative change in the nature of the x - ray variability .",
    "does the inner , x - ray emitting , accretion disk become strongly unstable above a certain fraction of @xmath40 ?    leighly ( 1999 ) provides similar data for a partly overlapping sample which includes only nls1s .",
    "this sample shows significantly weaker correlations , which may be partly due to the smaller ranges in h@xmath1 fwhm and @xmath33 covered by that sample . a proper study of the above correlations requires a much more systematic study of a well defined sample , including accurate bolometric luminosities , and high - quality optical spectroscopy .",
    "particularly careful analysis is required for low luminosity agns where nlr and host galaxy contaminations can be significant .",
    "nls1s are , with very few exceptions , radio quiet .",
    "the few radio - loud nls1s are only marginally loud ( siebert et al . 1999 ) , and may be intrinsically radio - quiet quasars where a weak jet is beamed at us . why are there no radio - loud nls1s ?",
    "in fact , why are there no radio - loud seyferts ?",
    "recent studies with hst have clearly demonstrated that all radio - loud quasars reside in elliptical ( or interacting ) galaxies , and that all quasars with spiral hosts are radio quiet .",
    "being radio loud means having a powerful jet .",
    "the jet is formed within a mpc of the center , where the massive black hole resides .",
    "the fundamental puzzle is _ how does the inner mpc know about the host type ?",
    "_ the answer may lie in the @xmath20 vs. @xmath39 correlation .",
    "the jet formation is set by the black hole , and the black hole properties are related to the bulge properties .",
    "spirals have small bulges , thus small black holes , and these do not produce powerful jets . on the other hand , bright ellipticals generally host very massive black holes , and these always channel much of the accreting gas into powerful relativistic outflows .",
    "is the production of powerful jets directly related to the black hole mass ?",
    "this question can be explored directly , without using any information about the host properties .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of @xmath59 vs. @xmath60 for all 87 pg quasars from the bg sample , where @xmath59 ( @xmath61 ) is taken from kellerman et  al .",
    "the answer appears to be positive .",
    "all quasars with @xmath62 are radio loud , and practically all quasars with @xmath63 are radio quiet .",
    "this then provides a phenomenological understanding of why seyferts ( inc .",
    "nls1s ) , which do not have very massive bulges , are practically always radio quiet , and why radio - loud quasars require hosts with massive bulges . the remaining puzzle is _ why should the formation of a powerful jet be so critically dependent on @xmath20 ? _",
    "careful systematic studies of the uv emission line properties of complete samples of radio - quiet agns are beginning to emerge , and these clearly indicate that narrow - line agns have characteristic spectra , which are different from those of normal agns ( e.g. wills , these proceedings ) .",
    "the best studied nls1 galaxy in the uv is the prototype , i  zw  1 ( laor et al .",
    "below i ll briefly describe some of our results and what they may imply .",
    "i  zw  1 shows unusual emission line properties .",
    "in particular , very weak c  iii ] , strong al  iii , strong fe  iii , and generally strong low ionization lines .",
    "wills et al .",
    "( 1999 ) explored a sample of 22 pg quasars , and found that the properties of i  zw  1 are common among nls1s .",
    "in addition they found that many of the uv emission line properties show strong trends with the h@xmath1  fwhm .",
    "the observed trends probably reflect an increase in the density and metalicity of the blr as the h@xmath1  fwhm decreases .",
    "i  zw  1 also displays interesting trends among its uv emission line profiles .",
    "the line peaks get progressively more blueshifted as the ionization level increases , rising from zero shift for o  i , mg  ii , and si  ii , to 250500  km  s@xmath15 for ly@xmath64 , si  iii ] , c  iii ] , and al  iii , to @xmath65  km  s@xmath15 for c  iv and n  v , and finally to @xmath66  km  s@xmath15 for he  ii .",
    "this trend is seen in other agns as well , but the amplitude of the blueshifts in i  zw  1 is about 4 times larger than in typical agns .",
    "in addition , the uv lines develop increasing excess blue wing flux with increasing ionization . these trends may be interpreted as an outflowing component in the blr , which is seen on the approaching side , but is obscured on the receding side ( due to a disk ? ) .",
    "the outflowing gas needs to get progressively more highly ionized as its velocity increases .",
    "we may actually be observing the edge of this outflow in i  zw  1 , as it shows a weak absorption system in ly@xmath64 , n  v , c  iv , and si  iv with a blueshift of 1870  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "is such an outflowing blr component typical of nls1s ?",
    "we do not know yet , but one can speculate as to why it may be common .",
    "bright nls1s have a high @xmath2 .",
    "radiation pressure which is incident on the blr clouds must ablate a surface layer and drive an outflow .",
    "the radiation pressure can overcome gravity in a surface layer with a column density of @xmath67  @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the outflows in high @xmath2 agns will be relatively thick , and may have enough emission measure to produce a noticeable contribution to the uv emission lines which comes from the denser cores of the blr clouds . as the velocity of the outflow increases , its density drops ( due to mass continuity ) , and its ionization state increases , thus explaining the observed profile trends with ionization level .",
    "the uv and x - ray absorption properties of nls1s may also be different from those of normal agns , as further discussed in brandt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and brandt ( these proceedings ) .",
    "nls1s also show peculiar optical emission line ratios , in particular strong fe  ii , and weak [ o iii ] , as is clearly established in the seminal bg paper .",
    "these correlations were in fact already noted by boroson & oke ( 1984 ) and boroson , persson , & oke ( 1985 ) , who found that the above parameters also correlate with the host galaxy colors , the equivalent width of the _ extended _ [ o iii ] emission , and the radio morphology .",
    "amazingly enough , boroson et al . suggested already back then that the underlying physical parameter was @xmath2 !",
    "this suggestion was based on the notion that the weakness of [ o iii ] ( extended and nuclear ) is due to the thicker accretion disk which collimates the ionizing continuum over a smaller solid angle , and reduces the nlr illumination .",
    "it is remarkable that this suggestion was again reached based on each of the following unrelated properties ; rapid x - ray variability , steep x - ray slope , and the narrow h@xmath1 .",
    "yes , in part .",
    "the current working definition for nls1s is [ o  iii]/h@xmath68 and h@xmath1  fwhm@xmath69  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the first part is well justified .",
    "a given solid angle of the nlr typically produces equivalent widths [ o  iii]:h@xmath70 , while the same solid angle at the blr produces about [ o  iii]:h@xmath71 .",
    "thus , [ o  iii]:h@xmath72 , i.e. it ensures that @xmath73 of h@xmath1 is from the blr .",
    "the narrowness of h@xmath1 is thus most likely not just an nlr contamination effect ( though it s always better to verify that by subtracting a properly scaled [ o  iii ] profile from h@xmath1 ) .    what about the h@xmath1  fwhm criterion ?",
    "the observed distribution of h@xmath1  fwhm is not bimodal , and thus there is no natural h@xmath1  fwhm cutoff for nls1s ( in contrast with , e.g. , @xmath59 of radio loudness ) .",
    "furthermore , it is now clear that nls1s lie at the extreme end of a continuous distribution of emission properties , and therefore the specific h@xmath1  fwhm cutoff is obviously arbitrary .",
    "the crucial question is what underlying extreme physical parameter are we interested in ?",
    "if we are looking for high @xmath2 objects , say @xmath74 , that translates ( see  2 ) to @xmath75  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "thus , the h@xmath1  fwhm cutoff needs to be luminosity dependent .",
    "km  s@xmath15 , i.e. @xmath76 for example , an @xmath77 quasar with h@xmath1  fwhm@xmath66  km  s@xmath15 should have about the same @xmath2 as an @xmath78 seyfert with h@xmath1  fwhm@xmath79  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "if one is looking for low @xmath20 objects ( e.g. for rapid x - ray variability ) , say @xmath80 , that translates to @xmath81  km  s@xmath15 , i.e. one can accommodate broader lines as one goes to lower @xmath33 .",
    "the highly simplified @xmath30 estimate in quasars appears to be accurate to within a factor of about 23 .",
    "nls1s thus most likely have a relatively low @xmath20 , and if they are not very faint , a relatively high @xmath2 .",
    "the rapid x - ray variability of nls1s is mostly due to their low @xmath20 , but there may also be some enhancement of variability for nls1s with the highest @xmath2 .",
    "nls1s , and seyferts in general , are radio quiet most likely because of their relatively low @xmath20 .",
    "the uv lines suggest the blr is denser and possibly more enriched .",
    "a possible scenario is that the high @xmath2 results from large amounts of gas being dumped into the center of the galaxy .",
    "this increased accretion rate brings in denser gas ( implied by the uv line ratios ) , enhances star formation rate and therefore metalicity ( implied by the strong n  v ) , and possibly blocks most of the nlr illumination ( implied by the weak narrow lines ) .",
    "the increased @xmath2 may enhance the column of the radiation - pressure ablated surface layer in the blr ( implied by the uv line profiles ) .    clearly , there are many open questions which need to be addressed to reliably establish or disprove the above scenario . specifically : 1",
    ". do nls1s follow the @xmath20 vs. @xmath82 relation ?",
    "the best way to proceed here is to extend the analysis of bahcall et al . and kirhakos et al .",
    "to lower luminosity pg quasars which qualify as nls1s .",
    "2 . how tight is the x - ray variability vs. @xmath20 relation ?",
    "one needs a well defined sample , high quality optical spectroscopy , and long x - ray integrations ( if the psd is non - stationary ) .",
    "3 . do nls1s generally show the uv emission - line profile trends seen in i  zw  1 ?",
    "one needs high - quality uv spectroscopy for a well defined sample of nls1s , and the pg sample can again be a very useful parent sample .",
    "are agn absorption outflows related to @xmath2 ?",
    "the ideal route here is to survey the uv absorption properties of agns spanning a large range in @xmath33 and in @xmath2 ( the pg sample again ! ) .",
    "5 . what controls the strength of [ o iii ] ? is it the nlr gas covering factor ?",
    "ionization state ?",
    "a careful study of various line ratios in the nlr is required for a conclusive answer .",
    "what controls the other intriguing correlations noted by boroson et al ( host colors , extended [ o iii ] , and radio morphology ) ?",
    "follow - up studies of these correlations with higher quality data is the first step required here .",

    "<S> agns with narrow balmer lines show various extreme properties . in particular , rapid x - ray variability , steep x - ray spectra , peculiar optical and uv line ratios , and possibly peculiar line profiles . </S>",
    "<S> since all these phenomena occur together they are likely to be related to one specific underlying physical parameter . </S>",
    "<S> i review recent evidence , based on hst imaging of low @xmath0 quasars , which suggests that the h@xmath1 line width and continuum luminosity of quasars provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the black hole mass . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that narrow - line agn have relatively low black hole masses , and thus high @xmath2 , as independently suggested based on their steep x - ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> i present additional evidence suggesting that the x - ray variability and the radio loudness are primarily driven by the black hole mass . </S>",
    "<S> the high mass inflow rate into the core of narrow - line agns may produce a denser and more enriched blr , a high column radiation pressure driven outflow , and a smaller illumination angle for the nlr , as suggested by the observed emission line properties . </S>",
    "<S> narrow - line agns may thus provide important clues for understanding the rich overall phenomenology of agns .    </S>",
