    "there is mounting evidence that a major fraction of the matter in the universe is dark .",
    "the wmap experiment gives as a best fit value that @xcite @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the relic density of cold dark matter in units of the critical density and @xmath3 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 .",
    "one of the main candidates for the dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , of which the supersymmetric neutralino is a favorite candidate .",
    "there are many ongoing efforts trying to find these dark matter particles , either via direct detection or via indirect detection by detecting their annihilation products .",
    "one of the proposed search strategies is to search for a flux of high - energy neutrinos from the center of the earth @xcite .",
    "this idea goes back to press and spergel @xcite , who calculated the capture rate of heavy particles by the sun . for the earth ,",
    "the idea is that wimps can scatter off a nucleus in the earth , lose enough energy to be gravitationally trapped , eventually sink to the core due to subsequent scatters , annihilate and produce neutrinos . due to purely kinematical reasons",
    ", the capture rate in the earth depends strongly on the mass and the velocity distribution of the wimps .",
    "the heavier the wimp is , the lower the velocity needs to be to facilitate capture . in ref .",
    "@xcite , gould refined the calculations of press and spergel for the earth and derived exact formulae for the capture rates . in a later paper @xcite ,",
    "gould pointed out that since the earth is in the gravitational potential of the sun , all wimps will have gained velocity when they reach the earth and hence capture of heavy wimps would be very small .",
    "however , gould later realized @xcite that due to gravitational interactions with the other planets ( mainly jupiter , venus and earth ) , wimps will diffuse in the solar system both between different bound orbits , but also between unbound and bound orbits .",
    "gould showed that the net result of this is that the velocity distribution at the earth will effectively be the same as if the earth was in free space .",
    "this approximation is widely used today where one further assumes that the halo velocity distribution is gaussian ( i.e.  a maxwell - boltzmann distribution )",
    ".    however , farinella et al .",
    "@xcite later made simulations of near earth asteroids ( neas ) that had been ejected from the asteroid belt .",
    "they found that many of these have life times of less than two million years .",
    "after that time they are either thrown into the sun or thrown out of the solar system . if this typical lifetime also applies to wimps , this would significantly reduce the number of wimps bound in the solar system , as pointed out in ref .",
    "this in turn would reduce the expected capture and annihilation rates in the earth and thus reduce the neutrino fluxes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , gould and alam investigated what the implications would be if bound wimps would actually be thrown into sun .",
    "they investigated two scenarios : an _ ultra conservative _ scenario where all bound wimps are depleted and a _ conservative _ scenario where all bound wimps that do not have jupiter - crossing orbits are depleted . in the ultra conservative view solar depletion is assumed to be so efficient that no bound wimps exist , whereas in the conservative view , jupiter is assumed to be faster at diffusing wimps into the solar system than solar depletion is at throwing them into the sun .",
    "both of these views significantly reduce the neutrino fluxes from the earth for heavier wimps .",
    "however , the truth probably lies somewhere between the conservative view and the assumption that solar depletion is very inefficient , i.e.  some wimps on bound orbits in the inner solar system will survive , but solar capture will diminish their numbers somewhat .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of solar capture on the distribution of wimps in the solar system and the implication this has on expected neutrino fluxes from the earth .",
    "we will do this by numerical simulations of wimps in the solar system and by reanalyzing the process of wimp diffusion in the solar system .",
    "finally , we will apply our results to the case where the wimp is the neutralino , which arises naturally in minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : capintro ] , we will briefly review the history of wimp capture calculations for the earth . in section [ sec : galhalodiff ]",
    "we will go through our assumed halo model and the role of diffusion in more detail . in section [ sec : one - diff ] we will go through the formalism for the diffusion caused by one planet and in section [ sec : soldepletion ] we add the new ingredient , solar depletion . in section [ sec : nummethods ] we present our numerical treatment of the diffusion problem .",
    "all of this will be put together with the dominant planets for diffusion in section [ sec : combined - diff ] where our main results on the velocity distribution at the earth are presented . in the remaining sections we will investigate how this affects the capture and annihilation rates in the earth and",

    "capture of wimps by the sun was first studied by press and spergel 1985 @xcite .",
    "their calculations were approximate in nature , especially when applied to the earth .",
    "this was refined in a series of papers by gould @xcite . in 1987 , gould @xcite derived the exact formulae needed to calculate the capture of wimps by a spherically symmetric body . when applied to the capture by the sun and the earth , his approach enhanced the capture by factors of 1.53 and 10300 respectively , compared to the previous approximations by press and spergel @xcite .    however , in 1988 , gould @xcite refined the analysis , taking into account that the earth is well inside the gravitational potential of the sun .",
    "the velocities of the incoming particles are increased when they approach the potential of the sun .",
    "this reduces capture substantially . on the other hand ,",
    "bound solar orbits are allowed .",
    "gould realized that particles scattered by the earth could become bound to the solar system .",
    "this scattering can be of two kinds : _ gravitational scattering _",
    ", which is elastic in that the velocity with respect to the earth is conserved or _ weak scattering _ off an atom , which can be inelastic and either lead to capture by the earth or make the particle bound to the solar system . in this context , an equation for estimating the timescales of weak and gravitational scattering was developed , following traditions of pik @xcite .    among other things ,",
    "gould concluded that , due to the differences in total scattering cross section , the gravity of the earth is more effective in changing the orbits of bound particles than is weak scattering . for capture by the earth",
    "though , weak scattering is the only process at work since gravitational scattering leaves the velocity with respect to the earth unchanged .    in 1991 , gould @xcite continued further , moving his attention to the gravitational diffusion caused by the other planets .",
    "further , he considered the combined diffusion effect of jupiter , venus and the earth concluding that it will make the velocity distribution isotropic in the frame of the earth . based essentially on liouville s theorem , this means that the phase space density of unbound and bound particles would be the same .",
    "specifically , for the most important parts of velocity space , this would happen on time scales shorter than the age of the solar system .",
    "obviously , such a scenario would substantially enhance capture of heavy wimps by the earth .",
    "further , he concluded that weak capture of wimps to bound solar orbits is negligible , and that one may use the  free - space  formulae derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for capture , even though the earth is deep within the potential well of the sun .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the calculations took a new unexpected turn in 1999 when gould and alam interpreted @xcite the results of farinella et al .",
    "farinella et al .",
    "had numerically calculated the fates of about 50 asteroids of which most were considered to be _ near earth asteroids _ ( neas ) .",
    "they concluded that about a third of the considered asteroids will be ejected to hyperbolic orbits or , more importantly , driven into the sun in less than 2 million years .",
    "if the results of farinella et al .  were applicable to general earth crossing orbits of wimps , the part of velocity space corresponding to bound solar orbits would be effectively empty , since the typical time scales at which such orbits are populated from unbound orbits are generally much longer @xcite .",
    "the basic results of farinella et al .  were later confirmed by gladman et al .",
    "@xcite and migliorini et al .",
    "@xcite .    to investigate the role of solar depletion , gould and alam @xcite analytically investigated the difference between the 1991 case of no solar depletion , and the other extreme , where there is no dark matter in solar system bound orbits at the earth . in the latter",
    "_ ultra conservative view _",
    ", capture is heavily suppressed .",
    "for instance , they found that wimps with masses above about 325 gev could not be captured by the earth at all .",
    "they also considered a scenario where wimps in jupiter  crossing orbits were not effected by solar capture , the _ conservative view _ , which they found allows wimps up to about 630 gev to be captured .",
    "( see section [ sec : gravdiff ] below for a more detailed discussion of these cutoff masses . )",
    "both of these scenarios significantly suppress the capture rates of wimps by the earth and the question to ask is if the results of farinella et al .",
    "can really be applied to all earth  crossing wimp orbits ? the orbits of asteroids ejected from the asteroid belt are , after all , rather special as they typically arise from resonances .",
    "it is thus not necessarily so that these results apply to all bound wimps .",
    "we will in the coming sections go through the necessary steps to investigate this question in detail .",
    "in order to make the calculations concrete , we use the maxwell - boltzmann model @xcite , where the local velocity distribution of wimps is gaussian in the inertial frame of the galaxy . at the location of the sun",
    "the distribution is @xmath5 where @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the three - dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "we will here use the standard value of @xmath8 km / s corresponding to @xmath9 km / s .",
    "the distribution is normalized such that @xmath10    the velocity distribution can be galileo transformed into the frame of the sun : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13=220 km / s , and averaged over all angles . in this special case of a gaussian distribution",
    "the transformation can be done in closed form@xcite . as gould have pointed out , the angle between the rotation axis of the solar system and that of the galaxy is about 60@xmath14 which makes the velocity distribution very close to spherically symmetric , _ if one considers averages over a galactic year _",
    "@xmath15 200 million years@xcite .",
    "the distribution used is mirror symmetric in the galactic plane which means that the time of average need only be 100 million years .",
    "the symbol @xmath16 will be used to denote the phase space number density @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the wimp mass , and @xmath19 is the wimp mass per unit volume in the halo .",
    "when the particles of this distribution pass through the solar system , the velocities are boosted and focused by to the gravitational potential . at the location of the earth ,",
    "the solar system escape velocity is @xmath2042 km / s , where we have used the speed of the earth , @xmath21 km / s .",
    "therefore the velocity at the location of the earth , @xmath22 , is , according to conservation of energy @xmath23    when a spherically symmetric distribution such as @xmath16 is focused by a coulomb potential such as that of the sun , the following statement holds : @xcite @xmath24 this can be understood as liouville s theorem for the spherically averaged phase space density , since @xmath25 since the velocity @xmath22 of the halo particles is always at least equal to the escape velocity , there will be a hole in velocity space so that @xmath26 this is important since capture by the earth is very sensitive to @xmath27 at low velocities .    the distribution @xmath27 can now be used to calculate the distribution as seen from the moving earth where the particle velocity is @xmath28 @xmath29 this means that the _ hole _ is shifted , so that it is centered around @xmath30 .",
    "this is visualized by figure [ pic_diffprincip ] which displays a two dimensional slice of the three dimensional velocity space .      in the absence of wimps gravitationally bound to the solar system ,",
    "the capture by the earth is totally suppressed for wimp masses larger than a critical value . to understand this , consider a particle approaching the earth with velocity @xmath31 at infinity with respect to the gravitational potential of the earth .",
    "if it is to be captured , it must be scattered by an atom to a velocity less than the escape velocity @xmath32 at the atom . by conservation of energy and momentum",
    ", the particle must have a velocity less than ( assuming iron to be the heaviest relevant element of the earth ) @xmath33 when it approaches the gravitational potential of the earth . solving for the wimp mass @xmath18",
    "gives @xmath34 here , @xmath31 is the speed ( at infinity ) of the approaching particle in the frame of the earth and is the highest allowed mass of the particle if it is to be captured by the earth .",
    "the escape velocity varies from 11.2 km / s at the surface to 15.0 km / s at the center of the earth ( see section [ sec : newcap ] for more information about the earth model we use ) , and capture is thus easiest at the center where the escape velocity is higher . using @xmath35 km / s , we plot in fig .",
    "[ vofmplot ] the relation between @xmath36 and the cutoff mass , @xmath37 .    with eq .",
    "( [ mcutofu ] ) , we can now relate to the cutoff masses in the conservative and ultra conservative views by gould and alam @xcite . in the ultra conservative view , we assume that only unbound halo particles are captured .",
    "halo particles can not be slower than @xmath38",
    "km / s at , and in the frame of , the earth ( this is also seen in fig .  [ pic_diffprincip ] ) .",
    "this gives a cutoff mass of about @xmath39 gev over which capture by the earth is impossible .",
    "this differs from the value of 325 gev for the ultra conservative view in gould and alam @xcite .",
    "the difference is because they used an average escape velocity of 13 km / s instead of the maximal one of 15 km / s that we have used in fig .",
    "[ vofmplot ] .    in the conservative view",
    ", we assume that jupiter  crossing orbits are filled .",
    "this means that all orbits outside the dot - dashed curve and the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ pic_diffprincip ] are filled .",
    "the lowest velocity wimp at the earth that is on a jupiter  crossing orbit is in the lower right - hand end of the dot - dashed curve and it has a velocity of @xmath40 km / s ( and is moving in the same direction as the earth ) .",
    "@xmath41 is the radius of the jupiter orbit .",
    "this value of @xmath36 gives a cutoff mass of about 712 gev , whereas gould and alam @xcite got a cutoff mass of about 630 gev .",
    "the difference is again due to the different escape velocities used , but also a different velocity to reach jupiter .",
    "we use the value @xmath42 km / s as indicated above , whereas they used an approximation for more general orbits than the one giving the cutoff derived here .",
    "so , to conclude , in the conservative and ultra conservative view , we can not capture wimps heavier than about 410 gev and 712 gev respectively .",
    "this is in rough agreement with the results of gould and alam @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , the solar system is full of gravitationally bound dark matter , the velocities can be much lower .",
    "as the lowest allowed velocity of the wimps @xmath43 tends to zero , the mass limit goes to infinity . typically , most wimps in the galaxy have velocities much greater than those of eq .",
    "( [ vcut ] ) , so only a small fraction of the wimps are possible to capture .    a particle in close encounter with a planet , for instance the earth ,",
    "may get gravitationally scattered into a new direction and a new velocity _ as seen from the frame of the sun_. however , by conservation of energy , the speed @xmath31 _ with respect to the frame of the planet _ is unchanged .",
    "this means that a particle at a particular place in velocity space may , by repeated close encounters with the earth , diffuse to any location on the sphere of constant velocity ( with respect to the earth ) , and nowhere else .",
    "the location of a particle at such a sphere can be specified by the angles at which it passes the earth .",
    "the angle @xmath44 is measured between the forward direction of the earth and the velocity vector of the particle , and @xmath45 is the angle of rotation around the forward direction of the earth , with @xmath46 at the north pole of the solar system .",
    "figure [ pic_diffprincip ] illustrates how spheres ( and circles ) of constant @xmath31 cross the limit of where particles have bound and unbound orbits .",
    "this corresponds to the possibility of gravitational capture and ejection from the solar system .",
    "a single planet can diffuse particles along spheres of constant velocity only .",
    "therefore , it is clear ( from e.g.  fig .",
    "[ pic_diffprincip ] ) that orbits with velocities @xmath31 less than @xmath47 km / s can not be populated by the earth alone .",
    "however , since the velocity spheres of different planet s are not concentric ( they need not even be spheres when the particles reach another planet ) , the combined effect may diffuse particles down to earth - crossing velocities @xmath31 less than @xmath47 km / s .",
    "this will be investigated in detail in section [ sec : combined - diff ] . in order to do so",
    ", we must first understand how a single planet affects the phase space distribution .",
    "in this section , we investigate the details of what will be called gravitational diffusion .",
    "we will develop tools for detailed investigation of the bound orbit phase space density , taking the effects of solar depletion into account .",
    "we will here start by looking at diffusion effects from a single planet only and will take the earth as an example . the exact same formalism is then used for venus and jupiter as well .    in this section",
    "we assume that when a particle is in earth crossing orbit ( perihelion less than the earth orbit radius @xmath48 and aphelion greater than @xmath48 ) , long range interactions with other planets are less important , and can be ignored .",
    "this is not a problem , as we in section [ sec : combined - diff ] add the effects of other planets ( apart from possible resonances ) .",
    "we will in this section closely follow gould @xcite , with some small modifications .",
    "we are interested in calculating the rate at which wimps with earth crossing orbits comes into close encounter with the earth .",
    "this will be used to estimate how the earth affects the wimp distribution .",
    "a close encounter is an event were the particle s impact parameter is smaller than or equal to some value @xmath49 .",
    "let s imagine the earth as being spread out on a flat ring of inner radius @xmath50 , outer radius @xmath51 and thickness @xmath3 , as in figure [ pic_preiorb ] .",
    "now consider a particle with perihelion less than the planet orbit radius @xmath50 and aphelion greater than @xmath50 .",
    "such particles will be said to have earth crossing orbits .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that due to the precession of perihelion , all such orbit ellipses will eventually intersect the earth ring .",
    "the small angle the perihelion sweeps out , as the orbit ellipse enters and leaves the ring is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the intersection angle between the wimp ellipse and the plane perpendicular to the location vector of the earth @xmath54 .",
    "since this happens four times during each perihelion revolution , the mean probability for such a wimp to intersect the ring of the earth during each wimp year @xmath55 is @xmath56 the probability for the wimp to come into close encounter with the earth is therefore @xmath57 times the cross section @xmath58 of such an event , divided by the area over which the earth is distributed .",
    "however , the length of the path which is inside the earth ring during each encounter is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the angle between the axis of the ecliptic and @xmath61 , the velocity of the wimp as seen from earth @xcite .",

    "( [ gammaekv ] ) was first derived by gould @xcite in a very similar way . among other things",
    ", he used it to calculate the ",
    "typical timescales  at which particles diffuse between different velocity space regions in the absence of solar depletion .",
    "it is also used for calculating the probability of weak scattering of wimps at the earth .",
    "the equations above are derived under some ( geometrical ) approximations with the aim of getting the correct scattering probabilities on average .",
    "there are however a few pathological cases where the geometrical model used above breaks down .",
    "this happens when @xmath46 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , in which case the probabilities above are unphysical .",
    "since this only happens for these few special cases we will artificially solve this by adding a small angle ( of about 1 degree ) to @xmath44 and @xmath45 when close to these regions .",
    "note that in principal , the problems could be resolved , by making @xmath76 a function of the full set of orbit parameters , but this is unnecessarily complicated for our purposes . for the interested reader ,",
    "we refer to a detailed investigation of the mathematical properties of @xmath77 as presented in @xcite and @xcite . to test our solution of adding a small angle in these pathological cases , we have investigated the effect of further increasing the small angle added and",
    "conclude that the actual value chosen is not important for the final results .",
    "this is reasonable , since orbits in the vicinity of these critical regions are quickly deflected into other orbits anyway .",
    "now that we have learnt how to calculate the probability for particles to come into close encounter with a given planet , it is time to apply this to gravitational diffusion . for the earth ,",
    "we were mainly interested in those particles crossing the sphere of one au during each revolution , since they have a chance of hitting the earth ( and possibly be weakly captured to it ) within each perihelion precession revolution .",
    "the gravitational scattering probability is dependent on the angular distance between the velocities before and after scattering : @xmath61 and @xmath78 , such that small deflections are more common .",

    "note that there are two points on the orbit that pass a given radius , but due to the perihelion precession , any given particle could show up at any of these orbit locations depending on the angle of perihelion .",

    "the archs of constant velocity _ in the frame of venus _ are shown to indicate the directions of diffusion caused by that planet . since the lines of constant velocity at venus cross the @xmath178=12.3  km / s line , venus may diffuse particles into the important @xmath17912.3  km / s region .",

    "we have verified that in the limit of very small step sizes , the unaveraged results approach the ones with averaging even in this region , but averaging allows us to get better accuracy and stability even with longer step sizes .",
    "we have also verified that the results are quite stable with respect to the averaging frequency .",
    "the result figures of the previous section show the results of a small step size ; 16 thousand years .",
    "a related problem is that even though the jacobian determinant of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jacobian ] ) is mathematically valid , linear interpolations do not assure conservation of mass .",
    "this means that when repeatingly transferring density information between a pair of planets , one can not be sure that the interpolation does not , in error , introduce or remove mass from the system .",
    "these artificial sources or sinks need to be removed .",
    "while it is not possible to do this on a cell by cell basis , we have investigated the total mass transferred to and from each planet and used this to renormalize the mass transferred to ensure mass conservation . in equilibrium ,",
    "the error is quite small ; under one percent , but when a distribution is built up , the error can be larger than that .",
    "we have further tested that the step size is not critical for the results .",
    "this indicates that our numerical implementation , with the stability measures outlined above , is stable and that the possible errors are under control .",
    "we have now presented two methods to keep the possible numerical artifacts under control : the averaging process to keep the densities consistent between the planets and the renormalization process to force mass conservation .",
    "both of these make our algorithms both more stable and reliable .",
    "it turns out , that the density of jupiter - crossing orbits is independent of the diffusion effects of the earth as well as those of venus .",
    "this is expected , since the mass of jupiter is so much larger , and the scattering probability increases with the planet mass squared , see eq .",
    "( [ gravprobd ] ) .    to investigate this ,",
    "we have numerically solved the earth ",
    "jupiter diffusion system in two ways : calculating the evolution with jupiter alone , as well as solving the two body diffusion problem with the methods described above . in either case",
    ", it takes only a couple of million years for jupiter s earth crossing orbits to come into equilibrium with the unbound orbits .",
    "this means that for jupiter  crossing orbits we can safely neglect the diffusion effects of the other planets and let jupiter fill these orbits alone .",
    "it also turns out that the diffusion of jupiter  crossing orbits is so much faster than solar depletion , and we can thus ignore solar depletion for these kind of orbits .",
    "we can then already now see that the ultra conservative view in gould and alam @xcite is too pessimistic and that at least as many bound wimps as in the conservative view remains in the solar system .",
    "we will next see what the fate is for bound orbits further inside the solar system .",
    "[ venus_jorden_princ ]    inspired by the last subsection , we will from now on keep the density of jupiter crossing orbits constant and focus on the combined diffusion effects caused by venus and the earth .",
    "the locking of the jupiter crossing orbits is done in the same way as for the free orbits , see eq .",
    "( [ matris_ekv ] ) , with the forced insertion of an identity matrix in the time evolution operator .",
    "as mentioned above , this is justified by the fact that diffusion of jupiter  crossing orbits is so fast that we can view these orbits as constantly being filled from the halo .",
    "we also change the interpolations between the earth and venus so that jupiter  crossing orbits are excluded ( as they are filled by jupiter ) .    before going through the results ,",
    "let us spend some time going through the diffusion processes in the low velocity region ( as seen from the earth ) .",
    "figure [ pic_ven_jup_small ] is a closer view of the space of low  velocity orbits .",
    "if we ignore the filling effects of jupiter , the earth would have to diffuse wimps all the way from the unbound orbits , starting at the @xmath192 km / s sphere .",
    "they could eventually reach the venus  crossing orbits to the left of the figure .",
    "venus could then act to diffuse the particles along _ its _ spheres of constant velocity .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the combined effect of the earth and venus could possibly populate all orbits outside the @xmath193 km / s line . by numerical simulation of the earth - venus system alone , it turns out that solar depletion is so strong that gravitational diffusion can only make a small contribution to the particle density below @xmath47 km / s .",
    "this is no big surprise , since comparing the scattering times in fig .",
    "[ pic_diff_tsc ] and the solar depletion times of fig .",
    "[ fig_logsoldep15 ] , we see that solar depletion is indeed very strong .",
    "if we instead use the knowledge about the density of jupiter crossing orbits , the situation is very different .",
    "the earth can scatter particles directly from the bound jupiter crossing orbits , starting at @xmath194 km / s , as opposed to @xmath47 km / s for free orbits .",
    "furthermore the time scale of scattering , as well as the angular path the wimps have to travel is much shorter , especially in the low velocity region .",
    "hence , solar depletion will not be as effective when we include jupiter , as the time scales for diffusion are more comparable to the solar depletion time scales .    in our full calculations",
    ", we will ( as mentioned above ) keep jupiter  crossing orbits fixed and include venus and the earth in the diffusion process .",
    "the calculations start with a solar system empty of dark matter , five billion years ago .",

    "the first ten million years were typically calculated using smaller step sizes , such as @xmath95 thousand years .",
    "the densities converge to their final values within a time of @xmath195 million years .",
    "an example of the resulting phase space density at a sphere of constant velocity is given in fig .",

    "it is important to remember that the free distribution was averaged over a period of @xmath196 million years .",
    "after such a time , the bound densities take on their final values within about @xmath197% , which is an indication that the results might vary slightly during the galactic ( half ) year . in practice , this has little effect , since the typical time scales for equilibrium ( see section [ sec : annrate ] ) between capture and annihilation in the earth are much longer than that and will average out these small variations over the galactic ( half ) year .    the resulting velocity distributions for the slowly moving particles",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "the ultra conservative and conservative curves represent the contributions from unbound , as well as unbound plus jupiter  crossing orbits respectively . for these , we again see the cutoff velocities of 12.3 km / s and 8.8 km / s as explained in section [ sec : gravdiff ] .",
    "the result of our full simulation , but ignoring solar depletion altogether is also shown .",
    "it follows the gaussian down to about 2.5 km / s where it drops to zero .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the results of gould @xcite , and we can see this agreement as a test that our numerical routines are performing as they should .",
    "our full numerical routines without solar depletion is a numerical implementation gould s analytical arguments about diffusion in the solar system and our results should thus ( as they do ) agree in this case .",
    "we also show our raw numerical result , which is the outcome of our full simulation with solar depletion included .",
    "it is significantly lower than the gaussian estimate in this low - velocity region , but not as low as the conservative ( or ultra conservative ) view .",
    "the general argument above that the time scales of solar depletion and diffusion are not too different and that some wimps should remain thus turns out to be valid .",
    "hence , solar depletion kills some of the wimps at low velocities , but not as many as one could have feared .",
    "also shown in the figure is our best estimate of the velocity distribution , which is the same as our raw numerical result , but modified at low velocities ( below 2.5 km / s ) to include the effect of the eccentricity of the earth s orbit , which will be explained now .",
    "the diffusion effects included so far does not provide means of filling the extremely slow ( @xmath198 km / s ) orbits .",
    "such processes arise when the eccentricity of the earth s orbit is taken into account .",
    "this could be done in a way similar to ordinary diffusion , but since @xmath31 would no longer be fixed even in the one planet case , the block diagonal one planet time evolution operator would be polluted with new , off diagonal blocks , making the diffusion problem much more complicated .",
    "however , the eccentricity of the earth s orbit will mean that the earth diffuse slightly differently in the different parts of it s orbit .",
    "this will cause a mixing of spheres of different @xmath31 and thus cause an effective diffusion in the @xmath199 direction .",

    "it is therefore quite reasonable to ignore these effects in our diffusion treatment at higher velocities . for the @xmath200 km / s region",
    "the time scales of @xmath31diffusion is comparable to the time scales of solar depletion , which makes it reasonable to assume that the phase space density is a slowly changing function with respect to @xmath31 which means that the sharp cutoff at @xmath193 km / s is not physical . to estimate the phase space density at these very low velocities ,",

    "our results are confined by the free space gaussian and the focused free space gaussian of the _ conservative view_. focused here means that the distribution as seen at the earth is somewhat larger than in the halo due to the fact that particles are focused when they fall into the solar potential well .",
    "thus , at typical galactic velocities , the gaussian is somewhat lower than both our best estimate and the conservative view .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that our new estimate of the wimp velocity distribution is , especially at low velocities , considerably lower than earlier estimates based on the gaussian approximation @xcite .",
