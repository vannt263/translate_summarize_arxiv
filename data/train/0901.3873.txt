    "the concept of high - gain adaptive feedback arose from a desire to stabilize certain classes of linear continuous systems without the need to explicitly identify the unknown system parameters .",
    "this type of adaptive controller does not identify system parameters at all , but rather adapts the feedback gain itself in order to regulate the system .",
    "a number of papers examine the details of various kinds of high - gain adaptive controllers @xcite , among others .",
    "more recently , several papers have discussed one particularly practical angle on the high - gain adaptive controller , namely how to cope with input / output sampling . in particular",
    ", owens @xcite showed that it is not generally possible to stabilize a linear system with adaptive high - gain feedback under uniform sampling .",
    "thus , owens , et .",
    "develop a mechanism to adapt the sampling rate as well as the gain , a notion subsequently improved upon by ilchmann and townley @xcite , and logemann @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we employ results from the burgeoning new field of mathematics called _ dynamic equations on time scales _ to accomplish three principal objectives .",
    "first , we use time scales to unify the continuous and discrete versions of the high - gain controller , which have previously been treated separately . next we give an upper bound on the system graininess to guarantee stabilizability for a much wider class of time scales than previously known , including mixed continuous / discrete time scales .",
    "third , the paper represents the first application of several very recent advances in stability theory and lyapunov theory for systems on time scales , and two new lemmas are presented in that vein .",
    "we also give a simulation of a high - gain controller on a mixed time scale .",
    "we first state two assumptions that are required in the subsequent text .",
