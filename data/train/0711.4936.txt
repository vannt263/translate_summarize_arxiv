    "@xcite unfortunately , the @xmath7-time due to cable capacitance ( @xmath8 nf ) and device resistance ( @xmath9 ) limits the bandwidth to a few khz .",
    "this is a major drawback for the direct application of sets as it limits the operation to a regime where @xmath10-noise is strong , either due to background charge noise , @xcite or to variations in the tunneling resistance .",
    "@xcite    the limitation on the frequency bandwidth can be bypassed using microwave techniques for reading out the real part of the set impedance . in these so called rf - sets , @xcite an @xmath11-circuit",
    "is used to transform the high impedance of the set to a high - frequency setup with a characteristic impedance of @xmath12 @xmath13 .",

    "@xcite in the co - tunneling regime , the sensitivity is expected to approach @xmath20 . @xcite",
    "another benefit of the strong tunneling regime is that a wider bandwidth can be obtained as the @xmath21-factor can be made smaller .",

    "this behavior has been summarized for single junctions by wang _",

    "one possible application is for charge sensing on quantum dots in the context of quantum computing . here",
    ", the coupling to a nearby quantum dot structure , e.g. , another nanotube , could be achieved via an antenna gate as it was recently demonstrated with sige nanowires.@xcite    the best way to enhance the sensitivity further would be to lower the temperature so the coulomb modulation is fully developed . for al / alo@xmath26 junction sets , the improvement at 40 mk was @xmath98 @xmath3 in the superconducting state and @xmath99 @xmath3 in the normal state .",
    "@xcite to improve the bandwidth , the only option is to increase the resonance frequency of the @xmath11-circuit .",

    "also the predictions from the metallic coulomb blockade regime with @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath107 are deviating , but the peak maximum is close to the measured .",
