    "the bounce - center transformation that transforms the guiding - center phase - space lagrangian into the bounce - center phase - space lagrangian relies on the existence of expressions for the parallel canonical coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 that are required to satisfy the canonical identity . in general magnetic geometry , this canonical identity is taken as an axiom for the bounce - center transformation @xcite , since the identity is difficult to prove directly beyond the harmonic - oscillator approximation . for practical applications in axisymmetric tokamak geometry @xcite , for example , it is a common practice to use expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the deeply - trapped approximation .",
    "the primary purpose of the present work was , therefore , to investigate the canonical identity beyond the harmonic - oscillator approximation in an axisymmetric magnetic geometry simple enough to allow explicit analytical results .",
    "the axisymmetric dipole geometry was chosen for its great simplicity ( e.g. , all confined particles are trapped ) as well as its universality in space plasmas @xcite and its applications in some recent laboratory experiments @xcite .    by using elegant lie - transform hamiltonian perturbation methods , we have been able to obtain explicit expressions ( with harmonic and anharmonic contributions ) for the parallel canonical coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 in axisymmetric dipole geometry , which satisfy the canonical identity . by including anharmonic corrections to the deeply - trapped particle dynamics",

    "future work will focus on the bounce - center transformation in axisymmetric tokamak geometry @xcite beyond the deeply - trapped approximation , for which the poloidal flux @xmath147 is no longer an invariant , but is replaced with the drift invariant @xmath331 , where @xmath332 and @xmath333 denotes the toroidal covariant component of the tokamak magnetic field .",
