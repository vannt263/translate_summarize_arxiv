    "as a consequence of the start - up from shot noise , the longitudinal coherence of x - ray sase fels is rather poor compared to conventional optical lasers .",
    "self - seeding schemes have been studied to reduce the bandwidth of sase x - ray fels @xcite-@xcite . in general , a self - seeding setup consists of two undulators separated by a photon monochromator and an electron bypass , normally a four - dipole chicane . for soft x - ray self - seeding , a monochromator usually consists of a grating @xcite .",
    "recently , a very compact soft x - ray self - seeding scheme has appeared , based on grating monochromator @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we studied the performance of this compact scheme for the european xfel upgrade .",
    "limitations on the performance of the self - seeding scheme related with aberrations and spatial quality of the seed beam have been extensively discussed in @xcite and go beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "we will focus our attention on the spatiotemporal distortions of the x - ray seed pulse .",
    "numerical results provided by ray - tracing algorithms applied to grating design programs give accurate information on the spatial properties of the imaging optical system of grating monochromator .",
    "however , in the case of self - seeding , the spatiotemporal deformation of the seeded x - ray optical pulses is not negligible : aside from the conventional aberrations , distortions as pulse - front tilt should also be considered @xcite .",
    "the propagation and distortion of x - ray pulses in grating monochromators can be described using a wave optical theory .",
    "most of our calculations are , in principle , straightforward applications of conventional ultrafast pulse optics @xcite .",
    "our paper provides physical understanding of the self - seeding setup with a grating monochromator , and we expect that this study can be useful in the design stage of self - seeding setups .",
    "ultrashort x - ray fel pulses are usually represented as products of electric field factors separately dependent on space and time .",
    "the assumption of separability of the spatial ( or spatial frequency ) dependence of the pulse from the temporal ( or temporal frequency ) dependence is usually made for the sake of simplicity .",
    "however , when the manipulation of ultrashort x - ray pulses requires the introduction of coupling between spatial and temporal frequency coordinates , such assumption fails .",
    "the direction of energy flow -usually identified as rays directions- is always orthogonal to the surface of constant phase , that is to the wavefronts of the corresponding propagating wave .",
    "if one deals with ultrashort x - ray pulses , one has to consider , in addition , planes of constant intensity , that is pulse fronts . fig .",
    "1 shows a schematic representation of the electric field profile of an undistorted pulse and one with a pulse - front tilt .",
    "a distortion of the pulse front does not affect propagation , because the phase fronts remain unaffected .",
    "however , for most applications , including self - seeding applications , it is desirable that these fronts be parallel to the phase fronts , and therefore orthogonal to the propagating direction .    a pulse - front tilt can be present in the beam due to the propagation through a grating monochromator . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the input beam is incident on the grating at an angle @xmath3 .",
    "the diffracted angle @xmath4 is a function of frequency , according to the well - known plane grating equation .",
    "assuming diffraction into the first order , one has    @xmath5    where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the groove spacing .",
    "( [ grateq ] ) describes the basic working of a grating monochromator . by differentiating this equation",
    "one obtains    @xmath8    where we assume grazing incidence geometry , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the physical meaning of eq .",
    "( [ diffgrat ] ) is that different spectral components of the outcoming pulse travel in different directions .",
    "the electric field of a pulse including angular dispersion can be expressed in the fourier domain @xmath11 as @xmath12 , while the inverse fourier transform from the @xmath13 domain to the space - time domain @xmath14 can be expressed as @xmath15 , which is the electric field of a pulse with a pulse - front tilt . the tilt angle @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 .",
    "more specifically    @xmath18    therefore one concludes that the pulse - front tilt is invariably accompanied by angular dispersion .",
    "it follows that any device like a grating monochromator , that introduces an angular dispersion , also introduces significant pulse - front tile , which is problematic for seeding .",
    "the development of self - seeding schemes in the hard x - ray wavelength range necessarily involves crystal monochromators .",
    "recently , the spatiotemporal coupling in the electric field relevant to self - seeding schemes with crystal monochromators has been analyzed in the frame of classical dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "this analysis shows that a crystal in bragg reflection geometry transforms the incident electric field @xmath19 in the @xmath14 domain into @xmath20 , that is the field of a pulse with a less well - known distortion , first studied in @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of this distortion is that the beam spot size is independent of time , but the beam central position changes as the pulse evolves in time .",
    "one of the aims of this subsection is to disentangle what is specific to the transformation by a crystal and what is intrinsic to the grating case .",
    "our purpose here is not that of presenting novel results but , rather , to attempt a more intuitive explanation of spatiotemporal coupling phenomena in the dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction , and to convey the importance and simplicity of the results presented in @xcite .",
    "we begin our analysis by specifying the scattering geometry under study .",
    "the angle between the physical surface of the crystal and the reflecting atomic planes is an important factor .",
    "the reflection is said to be symmetric if the surface normal is perpendicular to the reflecting planes in the case of bragg geometry .",
    "we shell examine only the symmetric bragg case , fig .",
    "[ grat3 ] .",
    "let us consider an electromagnetic plane wave in the x - ray frequency range incident on an infinite , perfect crystal . within the kinematical approximation , according to the bragg law",
    ", constructive interference of waves scattered from the crystal occurs if the angle of incidence , @xmath3 and the wavelength , @xmath21 , are related by the well - known relation    @xmath22    assuming reflection into the first order .",
    "this equation shows that for a given wavelength of the x - ray beam , diffraction is possible only at certain angles determined by the interplanar spacings @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to remember the following geometrical relationships :    \\1 .",
    "the angle between the incident x - ray beam and normal to the reflection plane is equal to that between the normal and the diffracted x - ray beam . in other words ,",
    "bragg reflection is a mirror reflection , and the incident angle is equal to the diffracted angle ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the angle between the diffracted x - ray beam and the transmitted one is always @xmath24 . in other words , incident beam and forward diffracted ( i.e. transmitted ) beam",
    "have the same direction .",
    "we now turn our attention beyond the kinematical approximation to the dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction by a crystal .",
    "an optical element inserted into the x - ray beam is supposed to modify some properties of the beam as its width , its divergence , or its spectral bandwidth .",
    "it is useful to describe the modification of the beam by means of a transfer function .",
    "the reflectivity curve - the reflectance - in bragg geometry can be expressed in the frame of dynamical theory as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the deviations of frequency and incident angle of the incoming beam from the bragg frequency and bragg angle , respectively .",
    "the frequency @xmath28 and the angle @xmath29 are given by the bragg law : @xmath30 .",
    "we follow the usual procedure of expanding @xmath31 in a taylor series about @xmath28 , so that    @xmath32    consider a perfectly collimated , white beam incident on the crystal . in kinematical approximation",
    "@xmath33 is a dirac @xmath34-function , which is simply represented by the differential form of bragg law :    @xmath35    in contrast to this , in dynamical theory the reflectivity width is finite .",
    "this means that there is a reflected beam even when incident angle and wavelength of the incoming beam are not related exactly by bragg equation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the geometrical relationships 1 . and 2 .",
    "are still valid in the framework of dynamical theory .",
    "in particular , reflection in dynamical theory is always a mirror reflection .",
    "we underline here that if we have a perfectly collimated , white incident beam , we also have a perfectly collimated reflected beam . its bandwidth",
    "is related with the width of the reflectivity curve .",
    "we will regard the beam as perfectly collimated when the angular spread of the beam is much smaller than the angular width of the transfer function @xmath33 .",
    "it should be realized that the crystal does not introduce an angular dispersion similar to a grating or a prism .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis based on the expression for the reflectivity , eq .",
    "( [ reflectance ] ) , shows that a less well - known spatiotemporal coupling exists .",
    "the fact that the reflectivity is invariant under angle and frequency transformations obeying    @xmath36    is evident , and corresponds to the coupling in the fourier domain @xmath13 .",
    "the origin of this relation is kinematical , it is due to bragg diffraction",
    ". one might be surprised that the field transformation derived in @xcite for an xfel pulse after a crystal in the @xmath14 domain is given by    @xmath37 = e(x- c t\\cot \\theta_b , t)~ , \\label{eoutxt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 indicates a fourier transform from the @xmath39 to the @xmath14 domain , and @xmath40 .",
    "in general , one would indeed expect the transformation to be symmetric in both the @xmath39 and in the @xmath14 domain due to the symmetry of the transfer function domain . while the symmetry is present at the level of the transfer function , it is not present anymore when one considers the incident beam .",

    "we thus avoided difficulties related with spatiotemporal coupling . ] .",
    "only the bandwidth of the incoming beam is much wider than the bandwidth of the transfer function . in this limit , we can approximate the transfer function in the expression for the inverse temporal fourier transform as a dirac @xmath34-function .",

    "typically one would think that a pulse front tilt can be introduced only by dispersive elements like gratings or prisms . here",
    "we presented an example in which no dispersive elements exists , and we stress that angular dispersion can be introduced by non dispersive element like crystals too .",
    "although we began by considering a case of reflection transfer function in bragg reflection geometry , none of our arguments depends on that fact .",
    "( [ reflectance ] ) still holds if the transfer function r is referred to the transmittance in bragg reflection geometry . for the transmitted beam ,",
