    "for the last decade , the inclusive production of mesons was a serious theoretical puzzle challenging our understanding of qcd , parton model , and the bound state formation dynamics .",
    "the roots of the puzzling history trace back to the middle 1990s , when the data on and @xmath6 hadroproduction cross sections @xcite-@xcite revealed a more than one order - of - magnitude discrepancy with theoretical expectations .",
    "this fact has induced extensive theoretical activity and led to the introduction of new production mechanisms , known as the color - octet model @xcite and gluon vector dominance model @xcite .",
    "since then , the color - octet model has been believed to give the most likely explanation of the quarkonium production phenomena , although there were also some indications that it was not working well .",
    "the situation became even more intriguing after the measurements of spin alignment @xcite-@xcite have been carried out showing inconsistency with the newly accepted theory . at the same time , it has been shown that the incorporation of the usual color - singlet production scheme with the can provide a reasonable and consistent picture of the phenomenon under study in its entirety .",
    "whithin the latter approach , a good description of data on the production of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath6 mesons both at the tevatron @xcite and hera @xcite has been achieved , and even a solution to the spin alignment problem has been guessed @xcite .",
    "the issue of the quarkonium production mechanism continues to be under intense debate .",
    "recently , the phenix collaboration at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has measured inclusive production in elementary proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "while for the rhic community the elementary @xmath7 cross section is only the baseline for the nuclear case , we wish to demonstrate that the elementary data by itself constitute a very valueable information about qcd dynamics in the region of intermediate @xmath8 10@xmath910@xmath10 . in our paper",
    "we present a detailed analysis of rhic data based on the and a large variety of unintegrated gluon distribution functions ( ugdfs ) .",
    "we show that the new precise data at small transverse momenta impose stringent constraints on ugdfs and , consequently , stimulate better understanding of the underlying gluon dynamics .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the production mechanisms employed in our analysis and discuss the different parametrizations of ugdfs . in sec .",
    "iii we compare our theoretical predictions with experimental results and derive new predictions on the quantities which at yet have not been measured but could serve as important cross - check of our understanding of the reaction mechanism .",
    "our findings and recommendations for the forthcoming experiments are summarized in sec .",
    "in this paper , we take into account a number of different mechanisms leading to the appearance of mesons in the final state ( of course , they are not thought to be all of equal importance ) .",
    "the considered mechanisms are the following .",
    "direct color - singlet production via gluon - gluon fusion @xmath11 direct production of @xmath3 meson @xmath12 and its subsequent decay @xmath13 ; + production of @xmath14-wave charmonium states @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 followed by their radiative decays @xmath18 ; + production of @xmath19 quarks and antiquarks @xmath20 followed by their fragmentation into @xmath21 mesons and subsequent weak decays @xmath22 ; + production of mesons in association with unbound charmed quarks @xmath23 examples of the relevant feynman diagrams for all the mentioned processes are shown in fig .",
    "every subprocess is accompanied by the emission of gluon jets , as is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    in general , there could also exist color - octet contributions .",
    "the latter can not be calculated from the first principles and are usually estimated from fits to existing data .",
    "it has been shown already that , within the approach , these contribuions are consistent with zero both at the tevatron @xcite and hera @xcite . in view of the uncertainties coming from other contributions",
    "we find it not useful to include color - octet contributions in the present analysis .",
    "processes included in our approach : ( a ) direct color - singlet production , ( b ) production of @xmath2 mesons , ( c ) open bottom quark production , ( d ) open - charm associated production , ( e ) color - octet production , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]     application of ugdfs to inclusive production of @xmath0 ( left ) and @xmath2 ( right ) .",
    "the upper and the lower parts of these diagrams are included in the @xmath1 evolution of gluon densities .",
    "the emitted gluons can realise in the final state hadronic jets .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]    a few words are in order to describe the formation of bound states .",
    "first of all , it should be noted that the amplitudes of the subprocesses ( [ direct])-([chi ] ) , ( [ jcc ] ) contain projection operators @xmath24 , which guarantee the proper quantum numbers of the state under consideration .",
    "these operators read for the different spin and orbital angular momentum states @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass of the specifically considered state and @xmath27 the mass of the charmed quark ( always set equal to @xmath28 of the meson mass , as is required by the nonrelativistic bound - state model ) .    states with various projections of the spin momentum onto the @xmath29 axis are represented by the polarization vector @xmath30 .",
    "the probability for the two quarks to form a meson depends on the bound state wave function @xmath31 . in the nonrelativistic approximation which we are using here ,",
    "the relative momentum @xmath32 of the quarks in the bound state is treated as a small quantity .",
    "so , it is useful to represent the quark momenta as @xmath33 .",
    "then , we multiply the matrix elements by @xmath31 and perform integration with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "the integration is performed after expanding the integrand around @xmath34 : @xmath35 since the expressions for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , etc .",
    "are no longer dependent on @xmath32 , they may be factored outside the integral sign",
    ". a term - by - term integration of this series then yields @xcite : @xmath38 etc . , where @xmath39 is the radial wave function in the coordinate representation ( the fourier transform of @xmath31 ) .",
    "the first term contributes only to @xmath40-waves , but vanishes for @xmath14-waves because @xmath41 . on the contrary",
    ", the second term contributes only to @xmath14-waves , but vanishes for @xmath40-waves because @xmath42 .",
    "states with various projections of the orbital angular momentum onto the @xmath29 axis are represented by the polarization vector @xmath43 .",
    "the numerical values of the wave functions are either known from the leptonic decay widths ( for and @xmath3 mesons ) or can be taken from potential models ( for @xmath44 mesons ) . including radiative corrections changes the values of the wave functions by a factor of 2 ( the nlo result compared to the lo result ) , and so",
    ", one can also expect large effect from higher order corrections .",
    "this leads to a sizeable theoretical uncertainty , which , on the other hand , can only affect the absolute normalization but not the shape of the @xmath45 spectrum .    when calculating the spin average of the matrix elements squared , we adopt the prescription @xcite for the off - shell gluon spin density matrix : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the component of the gluon momentum perpendicular to the beam axis , and the bar stands for the averaging over the gluon spin .",
    "in the collinear limit , when @xmath48 , this expression converges to the ordinary @xmath49 . in all other respects ,",
    "the evaluation of the diagrams is straightforward and follows the standard qcd feynman rules .",
    "this has been done using the algebraic manipulation systems form @xcite and reduce @xcite .    for the direct production mechanism ( [ direct ] ) the fully differential cross section reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the azimuthal angles of the initial gluons , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 the rapidity and the azimuthal angle of particle .",
    "the explicit expressions for the parton level matrix elements @xmath55 are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the phase space physical boundary is determined by the inequality @xcite @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 being the initial and final gluon momenta , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the standard kinematic function @xcite .",

    "the production scheme of @xmath3 meson ( [ prime ] ) is identical to that of , and only the numerical value of the wave function @xmath68 is different . in both cases ,",
    "the values of the wave functions were extracted from the known leptonic decay widths @xcite using the formula @xmath69 $ ] and were set equal to @xmath70 gev@xmath71 for meson , and @xmath72 gev@xmath71 for @xmath3 meson . to calculate the feed - down to states ,",
    "the @xmath3 production cross section has to be multiplied by the branching fraction @xmath73 @xcite .    for the production of mesons via the subprocess ( [ chi ] )",
    "we have @xmath74 the squares of the matrix elements , as being too lengthy , are not presented there but the full fortran code is available on request .",
    "the numerical value of the wave function is taken from the potential model @xcite : @xmath75 gev@xmath76 .",
    "the decay branchings to meson are known to be @xcite @xmath77 = 0.013 , 0.35 , and 0.20 for @xmath78 = 0 , 1 , and 2 , respectively . here , the off - shell gluon flux factor is defined as @xmath79 , according to the general definition given by eq.(2.3 ) in ref .",
    "for all other subprocesses one can use the approximations @xmath80 , but they are not suitable for the present case because the invariant mass of the final state is small and the difference between @xmath81 and @xmath82 can make pronounced effect on the @xmath83 spectrum . the numerical accuracy of the above definition was tested in a toy calculation regarding the leptonic production of mesons via photon - photon fusion : @xmath84 . we have compared the exact @xmath85 result with a number of calculations based on equivalent photon approximation and using different definitions of the effective photon flux ( such as @xmath86 , @xmath87 , etc . ) .",
    "we find that the `` @xmath88 '' definition is in the best agreement with exact calculation .    for the production of beauty quarks in ( [ bb ] )",
    "we have @xmath89 the explicit expressions for the parton level matrix elements @xmath90 can be found elsewhere @xcite . in calculations the @xmath19-quark mass was set to @xmath91 = 4.5 gev .",
    "further on , the produced @xmath19-quarks undergo fragmentation into @xmath21-mesons according to the peterson fragmentation function @xcite with @xmath92=0.006 .",
    "the outgoing @xmath21-mesons undergo then a decay according to the three body decay mode @xmath93 , to which the net effective branching fraction @xcite was attributed : @xmath94 ( resp . , @xmath95 ) .",
    "this decay mode was taken as a typical representative for all @xmath21-meson decays . as the decay matrix elements are unknown , the decays were generated according to the phase space .",
    "however , the fine details of fragmentation and decay are rather unimportant for our purposes , because @xmath19-quarks play only marginal role at rhic energies , except large transverse momenta of @xmath0 or @xmath3",
    ". we shall discuss the region of the large transverse momenta somewhat later .",
    "finally , for the charm - associated production ( [ jcc ] ) we write @xmath96 the explicit expressions for the parton level matrix elements @xmath97 as well as detailed description of the kinematics are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to close the description of the production mechanisms , we wish to state that we do not consider explicitly color - octet contributions in the present analysis .",
    "in fact , we know no data which would clearly manifest the presence of color - octet contributions . on the contrary , the numerical fits of the color - octet matrix elements based on the tevatron and hera data are incompatible with each other .",
    "moreover , a conflict between the model predictions and the data on spin alignment indicate that the production of vector quarkonia is certainly not dominated by the color - octet mechanism .",
    "some small contribution is not excluded but can not be calculated from first principles .      in general , there are no simple relations between unintegrated and integrated parton distributions . some of ugdfs in the literature are obtained based on familiar collinear distributions , some are obtained by solving evolution equations , some are just modelled or some are even parametrized .",
    "a brief review of unintegrated gluon distributions ( ugdfs ) that will be used also here can be found in ref.@xcite .    at very low @xmath98",
    "the unintegrated gluon distributions are believed to fulfil bfkl equation @xcite . here in the practical applications we shall use a simple parametrization @xcite for the numerical solution @xcite and use acronym bfkl .",
    "another distribution closely related to the bfkl approach was constructed by blmlein @xcite . at large energies",
    "( small @xmath98 ) one expects in addition saturation effects due to gluon recombinations .",
    "a simple parametrization of unintegrated gluon distribution in the proton can be obtained based on the golec - biernat  wsthoff parametrization of the dipole - nucleon cross section with parameters fitted to the hera data .",
    "the dipole - nucleon cross section can be transformed to corresponding unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "the resulting gluon distribution can be found in @xcite . in the following we call it gbw ugdf for brevity .",
    "another parametrization , also based on the idea of gluon saturation , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to gbw approach @xcite , where the dipole - nucleon cross section is parametrized , in the kharzeev - levin ( kl ) approach it is the unintegrated gluon distribution which is parametrized .",
    "more details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "another useful parametrization , which describes the hera data , and therefore is valid for 10@xmath99 @xmath100 10@xmath9 was constructed by ivanov and nikolaev ( in ) @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader for details to the original paper .    in some of approaches",
    "one imposes the following relation between the standard collinear distributions and ugdfs : @xmath101 due to its simplicity the gaussian smearing of initial transverse momenta is a good and popular reference for other approaches .",
    "it allows to study phenomenologically the role of transverse momenta in several high - energy processes .",
    "we define a simple unintegrated gluon distribution : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a standard collinear ( integrated ) gluon distribution and @xmath104 is a gaussian two - dimensional function : @xmath105 the ugdf defined by eq.([gaussian_updfs ] ) and ( [ gaussian ] ) is normalized such that : @xmath106 at small values of @xmath98 the unintegrated gluon distribution can be obtained from integrated distribution as @xcite : @xmath107 this method can not be directly used at small transverse momenta ( small factorization scales ) and must be supplemented by a further prescription .",
    "one possible prescription is freezing of the gluon distribution at @xmath108 , another is a shift of the scale : @xmath109 .",
    "of course @xmath110 and @xmath111 are bigger than the lowest possible scale for standard collinear distributions .",
    "this method can not be also applied at larger @xmath98 as here the scalling violation reverses and negative values are obtained .    at intermediate and large @xmath98",

    "while physically @xmath126 should be positive , there is no obvious reason for such a limitation for @xmath127 .    in the following we use leading - order parton distributions from ref.@xcite as the initial condition for qcd evolution .",
    "the set of integro - differential equations in @xmath19-space was solved by the method based on the discretisation made with the help of the chebyshev polynomials ( see @xcite ) . then the unintegrated parton distributions were put on a grid in @xmath98 , @xmath19 and @xmath128 and the grid was used in practical applications for chebyshev interpolation .    for the calculation of the direct @xmath0 production here",
    "the parton distributions in momentum space are more useful .",
    "this calculation requires a time - consuming multi - dimensional integration .",
    "an explicit calculation of the kwieciski updfs via fourier transform for needed in the main calculation values of @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( see next section ) is not possible .",
    "therefore auxiliary grids of the momentum - representation updfs are prepared before the actual calculation of the cross sections .",
    "these grids are then used via a two - dimensional interpolation in the spaces @xmath129 and @xmath130 associated with each of the two incoming partons .",
    "the kwieciski unintegrated parton distributions were used recently in applications to @xmath131 photoproduction @xcite , @xmath131 correlations in nucleon - nucleon collisions @xcite , production of gauge bosons @xcite , production of standard model higgs boson @xcite , inclusive production of pions @xcite , production of direct photons @xcite .",
    "good agreement with experimental data was obtained in the case when the data exist .    in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on leading - order perturbative solution of bfkl equation , the unintegrated gluon density @xmath132 is calculated as a convolution of the ordinary ( collinear ) gluon density @xmath133 with universal weight factors : @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 stand for bessel functions ( of real and imaginary arguments , respectively ) , and @xmath139 .",
    "the lo grv set @xcite was used in our calculations as the input collinear density . here",
    "the value of @xmath140 and the scale @xmath128 are parameters of the model .",
    "the resulting unintegrated gluon distributions depend on them rather strongly . sometimes for brevity we shall denote the distribution from ref.@xcite by jb .",
    "now we shall compare contributions of different processes discussed in the previous section . here a monte carlo method based on the vegas routine @xcite is used to allow an easy comparison of processes with different number of particles in the final state . in fig .",
    "[ fig : all_y ] we show contribution of different mechanisms discussed above to the rapidity distributions of @xmath0 meson for the rhic energy .",

    ": all_pt ] we show corresponding contributions to the transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath0 meson . in this exploratory calculation the cross section is integrated over the full range of rapidity .",
    "we obtain a rather surprising result that the sequential production of @xmath0 mesons via radiative decays of @xmath2 mesons is comparable to or even dominates over the direct color - singlet contribution almost in the whole phase space .",
    "the reason can be seen in the fact that the production of states refers to much lower values of the final state invariant mass , @xmath141 , giving emphasis to the small @xmath98 region , where the gluon distributions are growing up .",
    "this property becomes even more pronounced as the direct matrix element ( [ direct ] ) vanishes when the emitted final gluon is soft .",
    "our conclusion on the relative size of the direct and indirect contributions is compatible with the preliminary estimates obtained by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "we wish to note now some difficulties of the standard collinear approach for the @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the leading order contribution coming from the subprocess ( [ chi ] ) shows unphysical @xmath142-like @xmath83 spectrum . the usual excuse that the particles produced at zero @xmath83 disappear in the beam pipe and remain invisible does not work , because the decay products do have nonzero @xmath83 and can be detected . at the same time , introducing the next - to - leading contributions ( i.e. , the processes with extra gluons in the final state ) causes a problem of infrared divergences , which need artificial tricks to regularize them .",
    "it is well known that a large fraction of the @xmath3 mesons decays into channels with @xmath0 ( br = 0.56 @xcite ) .",
    "this contribution was not considered in the literature and requires a separate discussion .",
    "the inclusive cross section for @xmath3 can be calculated in exactly the same way ( color - singlet model ) as the cross section for direct @xmath0 meson production .",
    "the decays of @xmath143 change the kinematics only slightly .",
    "finally the @xmath3 contribution constitutes about 25 % of the direct ( color - singlet ) production .    also the b - meson decay mechanism gives a sizeable contribution at large transverse momenta .    summarizing , at the rhic energy",

    "very similar distributions are obtained for mid- and intermediate rapidity intervals . the result with",
    "ivanov - nikolaev ugdf exceeds the experimental data in the region of small transverse momenta .",

    "the distributions obtained with ivanov - nikolaev ugdf is slightly higher than those obtained with other distributions . in fig.[fig : dsig_dpt_chic2 ] we show distributions in transverse momentum of radiatively produced @xmath0 .",

    "ivanov - nikolaev ugdf gives the highest cross section for small transverse momenta .",
    "the bluemlein ugdf shown intentionally for large value of @xmath145 ( solid grey , green on line ) gives completely wrong shape .",
    "the shape in this case depends strongly on the value of @xmath140",
    ". it would be much better for smaller values of @xmath140 .",

    "the theoretical cross sections obtained with the kwieciski , bfkl and kharzeev - levin ugdfs stay slightly below the experimental data .",

    "there is relatively mild dependence on the details of the decay .",
    "however , these details may become important with a better statistics , when @xmath0 with @xmath160 10 gev will be measured .",
    "the present estimate of the b - decay contribution may be an underestimation because of the two following reasons : ( a ) it is based on leading - order approach , ( b ) choice of the renormalization scale ( see above).-factorization approach transverse momenta squared of initial gluons are taken as the scale of running @xmath140 .",
    "] therefore at presently measured maximal transverse momenta of @xmath0 @xmath161 8 gev the b - decay contribution at the level of 20 - 30 % is not excluded .",
    "let us concentrate now on correlations between produced @xmath0 and associated gluon(s ) . in fig.[fig",
    ": map_p1tp2t_kwiec ] we present two - dimensional distribution in transverse momentum of @xmath0 ( @xmath162 ) and transverse momentum of the associated ( the gluon related with the matrix element ) gluon ( @xmath163 ) for two different scales of the kwieciski ugdf .",
    "the bigger the scale is , the bigger is the spread of the cross section in the ( @xmath164 ) space .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the bigger scales means more gluonic emissions which statistically means the bigger spread .",
    "this figure is rather of academic value as in practice there are also gluons emitted in the process of the ladder - type emissions . strictly speaking",
    ", the latter have to be described using a full gluon evolution generator . on the other hand ,",
    "the relevant effects can also be estimated in an approximate way , as follows . on the average ,",
    "the gluon transverse momentum increases from the proton line towards the hard interaction block ( although there is no strict ordering in the transverse momentum in bfkl equation ) .",
    "so , it is most likely , that the last gluon in the parton ladder has the largest @xmath1 value . as a rough approximation",
    ", one can neglect the transverse momenta of all the other emitted gluons ( note that the evolution is in the @xmath165 space rather than @xmath1 space ) and use the conservation law in the last splitting vertex to set the @xmath166 of the emitted gluon opposite to the @xmath1 of the gluon entering the partonic matrix element : @xmath167 .",
    "the latter is known from the unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "this trick gives an estimate for the transverse momentum of the final state gluon jet .",
    "in fig.[fig : map_jpsi_gluon ] we show distributions of the cross section on the plane @xmath168 ( matrix element gluon or last gluon in the ladder ) for the kwieciski ugdf with running scale ( left part ) and bfkl ugdf ( right part ) . comparing these distributions",
    "we conclude that the gluons from the ladder ( lfl - last from the ladder ) contribute to lower transverse momenta than those associated with the matrix element @xmath169 ( me ) for the kwieciski ugdf , where at @xmath45(gluon ) @xmath170 5 gev the matrix element gluons dominate over the ladder gluons . for the bfkl gluons",
    "the situation is much more complicated as here the distribution for me gluons and lfl gluons are similar .    in fig.[fig : average_ptk1tk2",
    "t ] we show average value of transverse momentum of the matrix element gluon ( dashed line ) and of the last gluon from the ladder ( solid line ) as a function of @xmath0 transverse momentum .",
    "these average values have completely different dependence on @xmath171 .",
    "while average value of the lfl gluon transverse momentum is only weakly dependent on @xmath171 , the average value of the me gluon transverse momentum grows monotonically with @xmath171 . at low @xmath0 transverse momenta @xmath172 . at higher",
    "@xmath0 transverse momenta @xmath173 . for the kwieciski distribution this happens at smaller transverse momentum than for the bfkl ugdf .",
    "our calculations presented up to now show that the production of @xmath0 through radiative decays of @xmath2 mesons is one of two dominant mechanisms",
    ". it would be worth to verify this theoretical prediction experimentally .",
    "this would require measuring the @xmath2 mesons independently . in fig.[fig",
    ": dsig_dy_chic_predictions ] we show the distributions in rapidity for @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath144 .",
    "these results were obtained with the kwieciski ugdf , which seems to be the most reliable for the rhic energy range .    for completeness in fig.[fig",
    ": dsig_dpt_chic_kwiec ] we show the corresponding distributions in transverse momentum . in this calculation -1 @xmath148 1 .",
    "we wish to point out that the cross sections show no singularity at small transverse momentum .",
    "this contrasts with the collinear factorization predictions , which are either unphysicsl ( @xmath142-like ) or divergent ( if based on a @xmath176 subprocess @xmath177 ) .",
    "there is also a significant difference in shape between the transverse momentum distribution for @xmath175 meson and those for @xmath174 and @xmath144 mesons .",
    "this property emerges from landay - yang theorem which prohibits the coupling of vector states to massless photons ( just because of quantum numbers incompatible with bose statistics ) .",
    "the production of @xmath175 states at small @xmath83 is strongly suppressed because the initial gluons are almost on shell .",
    "the suppression goes away at higher @xmath83 , as the off - shellness of the initial gluons becomes larger .",
    "these features are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast to transverse momentum distribution of @xmath0 from the color - singlet mechanism , the distributions of @xmath2 mesons ( and consequently the distribution of @xmath0 from radiative decays ) strongly depend on the model of ugdf .",
    "in particular , in the limiting case of vanishing initial gluon transverse momenta : @xmath178 . for illustrating the effect quantitatively in fig.[fig : dsig_dpt_chic2_gauss ] we present transverse momentum distributions of @xmath144 for the gaussian ugdf with different values of the smearing parameter @xmath179 = 0.5 , 1 , 2 gev .",
    "the example clearly demonstrates that a measurement of transverse momentum distribution of @xmath2 mesons would open a new and unique possibility to test model unintegrated gluon distributions .    in principle",
    "the @xmath2 mesons ( mainly @xmath175 and @xmath144 ) can be identified via photon-@xmath0 decay channel . at rhic",
    "the @xmath2 production mechanism could be also identified using the @xmath4 and @xmath5 final channels .",

    "+ now we are coming to the issue of spin alignment , which was , and still is under intense debates in the literature .",
    "we want to stress once again that measuring the polarizaton of quarkonium states produced at high energies may serve as a crucial test discriminating the different concepts of parton dynamics .",
    "the polarization state of a vector meson is characterized by the spin alignment parameter @xmath187 which is defined as a function of any kinematic variable as @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the reaction cross section , @xmath190 is a selected kinematical variable and @xmath191 is the part of cross section corresponding to mesons with longitudinal polarization ( zero helicity state ) .",
    "the limiting values @xmath192 and @xmath193 refer to the totally transverse and totally longitudinal polarizations . here",
    "we consider only the behavior of @xmath187 as a function of the transverse momentum : @xmath194 .",
    "the experimental definition of @xmath187 is based on measuring the angular distributions of the decay leptons @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the polar angle of the final state muon measured in the decaying meson rest frame .",
    "the results of our calculations for the kinematic conditions of rhic are displayed in fig.[fig : spin_alignment ] . in order to show the theoretical uncertainty band connected with the choice of ugdf , we use two different parametrizations , which are known to show the largest difference with each other , namely , the ones proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( called derivative for brevity ) and the one from ref.@xcite .",
    "the upper panel in fig.[fig : spin_alignment ] shows the behavior of the spin alignment parameter @xmath187 for mesons produced in the direct subprocess ( [ direct ] ) .",
    "the increase in the fraction of longitudinally polarised mesons comes from the increasing virtuality ( and longitudinal polarization ) of the initial gluons .",
    "these predictions shown here are also valid for @xmath3 mesons .",
    "as far as the contribution from @xmath14-waves is concerned , nothing is known on the polarisation properties of their decays .",
    "if we assume that the quark spin is conserved in radiative transitions , and the emission of a photon only changes the quark orbital momentum ( as it is known to be true in the electric dipole transitions in atomic physics , @xmath197 , @xmath198 ) , then the predictions on @xmath187 appear to be similar to those made for the direct channel ( see lower panel in fig.[fig : spin_alignment ] , dotted curves ) . if , on the contrary , we assume that the transition @xmath199 leads to a complete depolarization , then we arrive at a more moderate behavior of the parameter @xmath187 ( dash - dotted curves in fig.[fig : spin_alignment ] ) .",
