    "@xcite observed a pronounced but unforeseen magnetic field dependence of the dielectric constant of certain multicomponent glasses at ultralow temperatures @xmath2 , i.e. , below @xmath3 , for fields as small as @xmath4 the effect was found to be by several orders of magnitude larger than expected for an insulator in the absence of magnetic impurities .",
    "this result was especially astonishing since earlier experiments did not indicate noticeable magnetic field effects @xcite . yet",
    ", careful measurements @xcite in magnetic fields ranging up to @xmath5 and temperatures below @xmath6 revealed that the magnetic field causes drastic changes in the dielectric response .",
    "these experiments have caused further investigations @xcite .",
    "following the original discovery , a number of different properties of the glasses were investigated in magnetic fields at these temperatures @xcite , e.g. , by using the dielectric dipole echo technique @xcite .",
    "many low - temperature properties of glasses have been successfully described in the past by a standard tunneling model @xcite . to a good approximation a tunneling system ( ts ) can be treated as a particle moving in a double - well potential ( dwp ) .",
    "because of the randomness of the glassy structure , the energy difference between the two wells as well as the tunneling matrix element have a broad distribution .",
    "this distribution is practically universal for all known dielectric glasses and results in an agreement between theory and experiment above @xmath6 . yet , below this temperature it is necessary to extend the model of isolated ts s by taking into account the long - range interaction between them in order to interpret numerous experiments @xcite .",
    "the concept of resonant pairs ( rp ) plays an important role here .",
    "it captures the important physics as long as the interaction between ts is not so strong that the tunneling picture looses its meaning .",
    "after the discovery of the anomalous glass behavior in a magnetic field , several extensions of the standard tm have been suggested @xcite .",
    "the dielectric properties of glasses at low temperatures are known to be due to the ts .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that this is also the case for glasses in magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , the principal question is how the magnetic field is acting on the ts s . in our opinion ,",
    "the model of wrger , fleischmann and enss @xcite deserves special mentioning and attention . in the framework of the model a direct coupling between the nuclear spin of a ts and the magnetic field takes place ,",
    "though initially it was alleged that this possibility should be ruled out @xcite .",
    "however , the echo experiments convincingly evidence the influence of the nuclear moments on tunneling @xcite .",
    "recently nagel et al .",
    "@xcite investigated isotope effects in polarization echo experiments in glasses .",
    "they observed magnetic field effects on amorphous glycerol when hydrogen , which has no electric quadrupole moment , was substituted by deuterium , that possesses _ nonzero _ quadrupole moment .",
    "thereupon , one can conclude that the quadrupole electric moment of the ts s is the key feature responsible for the effect .",
    "a generalization of the standard tunneling model can be done as follows @xcite .",
    "consider a tunneling particle with a nuclear spin .",
    "the energy levels of the system are degenerate with respect to the nuclear spin projection .",
    "this degeneracy is split if the particle has a quadrupole electric moment @xmath7 which interacts with an electric field gradient ( efg ) , i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the crystal - field potential . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "wrger et .",
    "@xcite supposed that the efg possesses axial symmetry . in this case",
    ", the energy of the tunneling particle depends on the orientation of the quadrupole quantization axis . in general , in glasses the axes @xmath10 and @xmath11 differ in the two wells of the potential ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "for this reason , the quadrupole energy changes when the particle tunnels through the barrier .",
    "the magnetic field influences the energy spectrum since the particle acquires a zeeman energy depending on the nuclear spin projection .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    within that generalized tunneling model the previously mentioned echo experiment could be described @xcite",

    "are responsible for the relaxation in glasses .",
    "for this reason it is interesting to investigate whether or not the application of the magnetic field influences the dynamics of resonant pairs .",
    "the principal goal of the paper is to show how the quadrupole interaction , if any , shows up in different characteristics of glasses . for this purpose",
    "we discuss first the explanation of the anomalous magnetic - field induced behavior of dielectric properties of glasses at ultra - low temperature based on the model @xcite .",
    "then , we clarify how these features are reflected in the relaxation phenomena governed by the interaction between tunneling systems .",
    "we shall extend in the paper the concept of rp so that it includes the quadrupole interaction as well as the interaction with the magnetic field .",
    "we will also investigate how theses interactions govern the relaxation rate of tunneling systems .",
    "a comparison of some of the results obtained with experiments will be made .",
    "consider a double - well potential ( dwp ) characterized by the asymmetry energy @xmath13 at low enough temperatures only two energy levels corresponding to the ground state in each well of the dwp are significant .",
    "these levels are connected by the tunneling amplitude @xmath14 according to @xcite , the parameters @xmath15 obey the universal distribution @xmath16 where @xmath17 as a constant .",

    "then the states of the particle are characterized by the sign of the _ pseudospin _ projection and by the particle _ spin _ projection onto a proper quantization axis @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the dimension of the hilbert space for the tunneling particle is @xmath22 .",
    "transitions of the particle between the wells of the dwp occur with conservation of the spin projection . introducing the spin projection operator @xmath23",

    "as long as the spin of the particle does not interact with the environment , the energy levels are degenerate with respect to the spin projection and the tunneling hamiltonian reads @xmath28   + \\frac { \\delta_{0}}{2}\\sigma^{x}\\left [   n\\right ]   \\right )   .",
    "\\label{hamnucl}\\ ] ] in this case , the spin degrees of freedom do not exert an influence on the tunneling properties of the particle , no matter which hamiltonian , either ( [ eq : spin ] ) or ( [ hamnucl ] ) , is used to describe the particle motion .",
    "suppose that an uniform magnetic field @xmath29 directed along the @xmath30 axes is applied .",
    "then , the tunneling particle gains extra zeeman energy dependent on the spin projection @xmath31 @xmath32 and the degeneracy of the energy levels is lifted .",
    "however , this splitting is irrelevant .",
    "indeed , in both wells of the dwp the magnetic field has the same magnitude .",
    "for this reason , the zeeman contribution depends only on the spin projection and does not depend on the pseudospin projection . for the case",
    "@xmath33 the energy structure of the tunneling particle before and after application of the magnetic field is presented in fig .",

    "for this reason , they can be excluded from the consideration .",
    "the two states of the _ tls _ pair @xmath119 and @xmath120 are referred to as a flip - flop configuration and the transition between them is called a flip - flop one .",

    "therefore we expect similar features in the behavior of the permittivity and in the rate of the interaction induced relaxation which is proportional to the rp concentration .",
    "this means that the multilevel systems can again be considered as effective two level systems . when the zeeman splitting exceeds the quadrupole one , the multilevel tunneling systems behaves exactly as two - level - systems . in figure [ fig07 ] we present in the framework of the model described above the results of the calculation of the parameter @xmath138 for different temperatures as a function of the applied magnetic field .",

    "below we investigate how these changes in the energy spectrum of the tunneling system caused by the interaction of the tunneling particle with the electric field gradient and the magnetic field influence the relaxation rate produced by the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the model under investigation assumes that the particle can occupy @xmath142 levels each in the left and in the right well of a ts .",
    "let us generalize the concept of resonant pairs to the case @xmath143    [ ptbh ]    fig9.eps    consider the tunneling system ( 1 ) in fig .",
    "there we are dealing with a ground - state multiplet the states of which are denoted by their spinor parts @xmath144 and an excited state multiplet denoted by @xmath145 .",
    "the corresponding energies are @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "they are derived from the energies @xmath148 and @xmath149 of the ts in the absence of the quadrupolar and zeeman interaction .",

    "( [ trtls ] ) is a small parameter formed by strongly asymmetric tunneling systems .",
    "we have shown that the strong magnetic field dependence of the electric susceptibility in ultracold glasses can be understood by taking into account the interactions of tunneling systems in the presence of nuclear quadrupolar moment .",
    "the essential point is the following : even by a small applied magnetic field the number of different energy levels of a tunneling system is increased .",
    "this in turn , modifies the concentration of resonant tunneling pairs and leads this way to observable effects .",
    "two kinds of experiments can be related to the present investigation . the first kind deals with the experimental determination of the real part of the response of the system to an applied magnetic field .",
    "we find for the field dependence of the static electric susceptibility the right order of magnitude of the effect . that a too small effect was found in @xcite",
    "may result from the use of perturbation theory .",
    "another unexplained feature , namely a plateau in the temperature dependence of the electric susceptibility , sometimes called dielectric saturation is most probably due to a dependence of the tunneling matrix element @xmath203 on the spinors of the right and left well .",
    "the second group of experiments is related to measurements of the imaginary part of the response . in this case information on the relaxation rate of elementary excitations",
    "can be obtained .",
    "for example , measuring the echo amplitude allows to determine the behavior of the ts coherence time @xmath206 as function of field .",
    "the echo amplitude has been found to show a non - monotonic dependence on the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the transverse relaxation rate @xmath207 . in sec .",
    "5 we have introduced the parameter @xmath208 depending on the magnetic field which controls the concentration of rp . if the relaxation in the system is due to the resonant pairs , the transverse relaxation rate is directly proportional to the concentration of rp . without the quadrupolar effect , the relaxation rate @xmath209 @xcite .",
    "if the quadrupolar effects are taken into account , the concentration of rp increases by the factor @xmath210 therefore , the relaxation rate becomes @xmath211 the non - monotonic behavior of the parameter @xmath208 on the magnetic field correlates with the behavior of the echo amplitude found in the experiments mentioned above .",
    "note that in high magnetic fields @xmath208 reduces to @xmath212 because in that limit the energy levels are equally spaced as in fig ( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the standard scheme of interpreting the echo experiments is based on the assumption that ts s are two - level ones . in that case",
    "they can be described in terms of @xmath207 .",
    "this is not the case when the quadrupolar effects are taken into account .",
    "therefore it is no surprise that the calculated @xmath207 can only qualitatively but not quantitatively describe the echo experiments .",
    "instead the approach in @xcite based on a multilevel description of ts s instead of the standard bloch equations seems very reasonable .    for this reason",
    ", another kind of low - temperature experiments should be made to clarify the role if the @xmath1 interaction between the tunneling system .",
    "for example , measurements of the magnetic field dependence of dielectric loss or internal friction would allow to extract information on the lifetime @xmath213 of the excitations .",
    "we want to show that in this case the factor @xmath208 should show up in an even more important way .",
    "the spectral diffusion reaches its maximal value @xmath214 at time @xmath215 therefore , the rate of the spectral diffusion is @xmath216 on the other hand the spectral diffusion rate relates to @xmath217   @xcite .",
    "then @xmath218 thus the relaxation rate @xmath219 shows an even stronger quadrupole and magnetic field dependence than @xmath207 and investigation of dielectric loss or internal friction in the presence of the magnetic field opens an attractive opportunity to investigate the role of the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the above analysis is based on the assumption that the efg has approximately axial symmetry , i.e. , that the parameter @xmath108 is small .",
    "generally this is not the case .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic field induced relaxation mechanism has a quite universal character .",
    "indeed , let the nuclear spin be half - integer .",
    "it follows from kramers theorem that in zero magnetic field the energy spectrum is degenerate .",
    "so , after application of the magnetic field the total number of levels of the multilevel ts increases and an effect takes place .",
    "the nature of the tunneling systems in amorphous solids remains puzzling despite of the large theoretical efforts probing various models .",
    "the main problem of the theory is the lack of experiments which test particular models versus the original phenomenological model @xcite , which simply employs the distribution ( [ distrib ] ) .",
    "we expect that the magnetic field experiments allow to reveal which and how many atoms participate in the tunneling .",
