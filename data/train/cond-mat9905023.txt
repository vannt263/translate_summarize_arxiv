    "since the first electronic transport measurements in semiconductor quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime were made,@xcite a significant amount of data has been accumulated . the appropriate theoretical model used in understanding this data depends on the size of the electronic island .",
    "two situations arise .",
    "when dealing with small or very small systems , where the number of electrons @xmath0 in the coulomb island is of the order of 10 ( or a maximum of @xmath1 ) , the self - consistent approach is successful.@xcite in this regime the environment generates a smooth , nearly parabolic potential and most of the quantum dot properties can be understood in terms of an unsophisticated self - consistent electronic structure calculation . on the other hand ,",
    "the most adequate theoretical description for data taken from larger systems , with @xmath0 of order @xmath2 ( or at least larger than @xmath1 ) , is statistical . in distinction to the first case , for large dots the confining potential is no longer expected to be parabolic up to energies close to the fermi surface .",
    "in fact , in large gated structures , the dot geometrical shape can be substantially modified by adjusting voltages . within the single - particle picture",
    ", it is believed that the complexity of the confining potential yields a chaotic motion in the classical limit , thus justifying a quantum mechanical modeling based on a statistical theory.@xcite further arguments for such approach are provided by the influence of weak disorder and the fact ( not always justifiable ) that many - body correlations should bring only small corrections to the usual single - particle description of transport .    the single - particle statistical theory@xcite is widely accepted because of its early success in predicting the distribution of peak heights in the single - channel tunneling regime , later experimentally confirmed.@xcite in the regime where the mean level spacing @xmath3 is much larger than @xmath4 ,",
    "the predicted distribution of peak heights is strongly non - gaussian and clearly peaked towards zero values .",
    "while the single - particle plus constant interaction theory captures most qualitative aspects observed in the experiments , some quantitative aspects defy comprehension .",
    "perhaps the most celebrated one is the absence of wigner - dyson fluctuations in the conductance peak spacings.@xcite    there is also an important and rather prominent feature of the experimental data which is less discussed in the literature and remains unexplained : the notable clustering of peaks with similar heights .",
    "that is , in most experiments ( an important exception is ref .  ) , by sweeping the gate voltage , large and small peaks tend to appear in bunches , indicating the existence of peak to peak correlation .",
    "this is at odds with the statistical single - particle theory at low temperatures , which associates to each peak an independent single - particle eigenstate .",
    "a recent experiment @xcite showed yet another puzzling feature : the correlation tends to increase with temperature and the slope depends on the dot area ( for a small dot it saturated at @xmath5 . )",
    "any successful theoretical model describing all these issues has to take into account that each conductance peak corresponds to a system containing a different number of particles .",
    "as electrons are added to the quantum dot the gate voltage configuration varies and the confining potential changes accordingly.@xcite furthermore , and probably even more important , the additional particles change the electron mean field .",
    "although not the original idea addressed in ref .  , we can parameterize the total change in the single - particle energies _ and _ wave functions by moving from one peak to the next through a parametric variation @xmath6 which takes into account changes of the external and mean field potentials",
    ". we can call it the mean field `` deformation '' . although difficult to quantify , @xmath6 is obviously nonzero .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the statistical measures of the conductance peak heights , namely their distribution and autocorrelation function .",
    "we use the constant interaction plus independent particle model to discuss the role of `` deformations '' and temperature .",
    "we show that for @xmath7 the theoretical peak height distribution agrees with the experimental data for systems with chaotic underlying dynamics , irrespective of the deformation parameter .",
    "we also show a very reasonable agreement between chaotic and _ some _ integrable models for @xmath8 . as for the peak height autocorrelation function",
    ", we could not find any robust and generic mechanism to explain the strong peak to peak correlations seen in some experiments .",
    "we were only able to find such correlations for special choices of lead positions .",

    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the theoretical description used in this study is based on the so - called independent particle plus  constant interaction \" ( ci ) model,@xcite where the electron - electron interaction is taken into account through a fixed ( capacitive ) charging energy term in the hamiltonian : @xmath9 + \\frac{u}{2 } n(n-1 ) + e\\eta v_g n,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the total number of electrons with effective mass @xmath10 in the dot , @xmath11 is the charging energy , and @xmath12 is some tunable gate voltage .",
    "the coefficient @xmath13 is a function of the capacitance matrix elements of the dot.@xcite the single particle potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omodelo ] ) accounts only for the electrostatic confinement and background disorder .",
    "when the dot is in equilibrium with the reservoirs represented by the leads , its total energy is minimal for a certain value of @xmath0 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath0 depends on the dot confining geometry , chemical potential ( fermi energy ) in the reservoirs , and gate voltage @xmath12 .",
    "the electronic many - body ground state wave function is given by the slater determinant of all bounded single - particle eigenstates with energies smaller than the fermi energy . in its crudest version ,",
    "the single - particle states in the ci model are determined by the bare electron confining potential alone .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that many - body effects are important and one should instead get the single - particle states from a mean - field approximation , such as hartree - fock .",
    "we will not attempt to answer this question in this work , but rather comprehensively study most features that may be traced to one - body effects .",
    "both single - particle eigenenergies and eigenfunctions influence the electronic transport through the quantum dot .",
    "the wave functions , in particular , enter into the standard formulation@xcite through the partial decay widths @xmath14 which quantify the connectivity between the eigenstate in the dot and the electronic states in the leads ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for right and left leads , respectively ) . in the regime of thermally broadened resonances and large charging energy , @xmath17 , linear response theory yields the following expression for the the two - point conductance of a dot ( weakly ) coupled to reservoirs@xcite @xmath18 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times f \\biglb ( \\delta e -ts(n)+ts(n-1 ) \\bigrb ) , \\label{eq : conductance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 .",

    "sequences of conductance peaks are observed by varying the external gate voltage @xmath12 , thus changing the electrostatic energy in the dot . within the ci model , in the single - level tunneling regime ,",
    "where @xmath30 , and as the gate potential is swept , conductance peaks occur whenever the resonance condition @xmath31 is satisfied.@xcite here @xmath32 is the ground state energy of the dot containing @xmath0 electrons . within the constant interaction model , eq .",

    "( [ eq : resonance ] ) is generally valid .",
    "@xcite the existence of many - body correlation effects may lead to a breakdown of koopmans theorem and a different resonance condition .",
    "furthermore , the strong assumption of a constant @xmath11 prevents an adequate description of fluctuations in peak position .",
    "nevertheless , these restrictions shall not affect our discussion on the statistics of peak heights in the single - particle approximation .    in order to make the notation more compact ,",
    "let us rescale the conductance to a dimensionless form , @xmath36 moreover , for the sake of simplicity , we consider that the average decay widths ( taken over many resonances ) are equal : @xmath37 . in the temperature regime where @xmath38 , the resonance condition , combined with eq .",

    "these predictions were later experimentally confirmed by two independent experiments.@xcite equations  ( [ eq : pgoeg ] ) and ( [ eq : pgueg ] ) will serve us as benchmarks in later sections .    as mentioned in the introduction , the early success of the random matrix hypothesis@xcite in explaining statistical properties of conductance peaks in quantum dots seemed somewhat inconsistent .",
    "the experimental confirmation of theoretical prediction of the distribution @xmath51 contrasts with the observation of strong correlations between successive peak heights in most data sets.@xcite recall that standard random matrix theory ( rmt)@xcite leads to uncorrelated eigenfunctions , giving conductance peaks with a similar property .",
    "however , the fact that the condition @xmath52 is hardly achieved in the early experiments suggests that the discrepancy could be related to a finite temperature effect .",
    "the inclusion of finite temperature in rmt was carried out by alhassid and collaborators @xcite by computing the canonical occupation factors @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : conductance ] ) .",
    "already for @xmath53 they observed significant temperature corrections in @xmath51 , as compared to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pgueg ] ) .",
    "the corrections , however , fail to quantitatively reproduce the available experimental data,@xcite and the discrepancy grows larger as temperatures goes beyond @xmath3 .",
    "we will return to this point later .    the canonical average necessary to calculate @xmath25",
    "can be taken either by explicit summation of all possible single - particle configurations , as recently done in ref .  , or in a quadrature approximation for the canonical partition function , as in refs .",
    "we adopt the latter approach in what follows .",

    "( [ eq : partitionfunction ] ) is in order . in our numerical simulations we varied the number of eigenstates",
    "@xmath58 summed over depending on the temperature range . for @xmath66 , we found that as few as 4 were sufficient to achieve good convergence ; for higher temperatures , @xmath67 , we used as many as 20 .    in the experimental setups where",
    "plunger gates are used to define both shape and depth of the confining potential , one expects that variations in the potential @xmath12 will continuously deform the dot@xcite this situation is met in lateral quantum dots , where most of the data were taken @xcite ( an important exception is ref .  ) .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out in the introduction , as one adds electrons to the dot the mean field also changes .",
    "thus , to establish theoretically the direct relation between @xmath12 and the dot electronic mean field it is necessary to know the experimental set up in detail and perform rather sophisticated numerical simulations . while such study is desirable , it is not crucial for our analysis and will not be pursued here .",
    "we therefore simplify the problem parameterizing the `` deformations '' by a generic variable @xmath68 on which eigenvalues and eigenfunctions will depend . in summary ,",
    "the key point behind this hypothesis is that by adding one extra electron to the dot the mean electrostatic potential changes parametrically , on average , by @xmath6.@xcite in this way , the @xmath0th conductance peak involves a sum over eigenergies and partial widths @xmath69 , while the next peak in the sequence will be depend on @xmath70 .",
    "it is convenient to measure the deformations in units of the typical distance between energy level anti - crossings , namely , the inverse root mean square derivative of the energy levels with respect to deformations:@xcite @xmath71^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] ( here @xmath72 stands for an average over states @xmath20 and over the parameter @xmath68 ) . when the addition of a single extra electron is enough to scramble strongly energy levels and wave functions , @xmath73 . in this circumstances",
    ", we expect each new conductance peak to signal a different and independent realization of the effective confining potential in the dot .",
    "thus , in the regime of strong deformations , peaks heights should be fairly uncorrelated , in contrast with what happens as temperature is increased .",
    "a systematic study of temperature and shape deformation combined is carried out below .",
    "in this section we investigate the effect of parametric hamiltonian variations on thermal averages .",
    "more specifically , we are interested in answering two questions : ( a ) are the correlations between consecutive peak heights sensitive to shape deformations ?",
    "( b ) what is the effect of parametric variations on the distribution of peak heights ?",
    "we assume that the electronic underlying classical dynamics is fully chaotic and , therefore , its quantum hamiltonian can be modeled by a random matrix . in doing so ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to universal aspects ; we leave the study of some specific dynamical models and nonuniversal features to the following sections .",
    "since a fully analytical treatment of the problem is not available , we implement the numerical procedure discussed in the sec .",
    "[ sec : thetheory ] to evaluate the canonical averages from a given sequence of energy levels and tunneling rates .",
    "the set of eigenenergies and eigenfunctions of a random parametric hamiltonian can be conveniently obtained from a hermitian matrix of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are independent @xmath77 matrices ( @xmath78 in our calculations ) belonging to the proper gaussian ensemble . in our numerical calculations , the orthogonal ensemble ( goe , @xmath41 )",
    "was used to model the situation when no magnetic field is present ( time - reversal symmetric systems ) . for the case with non - zero magnetic field and",
    "broken time - reversal symmetry , we used instead the unitary ensemble ( gue , @xmath40 ) . for each realization of @xmath75 and @xmath76 and a given value of the parameter @xmath68 ,",
    "the matrix @xmath79 was diagonalized through standard methods",
    ". only the 100 central eigenvalues were kept after each diagonalization .",
    "this was done in order to avoid large density variations in the spectra and the consequent need for unfolding , as well as the inclusion of localized eigenstates from the tails of the band .",
    "the resulting eigenfunctions @xmath80 were used to generate the right and left tunneling rates according to the point contact approximation @xmath81 and @xmath82 . the energy eigenvalues @xmath83 were used in the quadrature approximation for the canonical partition function given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : partitionfunction ] ) .",
    "thus , for a given realization of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , a certain deformation @xmath6 , and temperature @xmath84 , we simulated sequences of dimensionless conductance peak heights as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gmax ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the calculation shown in ref .  , although similar in formulation to ours , relied only on the randomness of the tunneling rates and neglected fluctuations in the eigenenergies by adopting a picket - fence approximation for the spectrum . here , instead",
    ", we use eigenenergies fully consistent with the wigner - dyson statistics predicted from rmt . for the unitary case , due to",
    "the strong level repulsion the picket - fence is a reasonable first approximation for the spectrum and we expect our results to be similar to those of ref .  .",
    "indeed we observe only small , 10% differences in peak height correlation functions ( see below ) .",
    "for the orthogonal case , however , level repulsion is weaker and to obtain accurate results it is recommended to use the exact spectrum .",
    "this issue becomes very important when calculating @xmath25 for dynamical systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamical ] we shall resume this discussion .    the results presented here involved data obtained from 50 independent realizations of the matrices @xmath75 and @xmath76 . for each of these realizations ,",
    "150 values of @xmath68 were used within the interval @xmath85 $ ] to generate peak sequences related to different `` shape '' deformations .",
    "additional statistics was obtained by varying the `` chemical potential '' ( i.e. , the initial number of electrons in the dot ) and the `` original shape '' ( i.e , the initial @xmath68 point ) , taking care to avoid introducing spurious correlations between distinct peak sequences .    as an illustration ,",
    "three typical sequences of conductance peak maxima are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmtpeaks ] for the orthogonal ensemble with some arbitrary deformation .",
    "notice that , as temperature increases , the overall modulation becomes more pronounced , marking the existence of large peak - to - peak correlations .",
    "the clustering of peaks with similar heights is characteristic of the dominance of a single well - connected eigenstate over a wide energy range .",
    "the most characteristic feature of the thermal average is that the occurrence of small peaks becomes unlikely , even for temperatures which are smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "this can be observed in the curves presented in ref .   for the distribution of peak heights , although the effect is not always quantitatively confirmed by the experiments .",
    "for instance , in the case of preserved time - reversal symmetry the absence of small peaks should be very pronounced , in clear contradiction with the currently available experimental data.@xcite    to start a quantitative analysis , let us first concentrate on the correlation of peak heights between neighboring conductance peaks . for this purpose",
    ", we have calculated the correlation function @xmath86 where @xmath87 represents the deviation from average height of the @xmath0th peak .",
    "the averages @xmath72 are taken over different realizations of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , as well as over @xmath0 .",
    "the results for each gaussian ensemble at different temperatures and deformations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : rmtcoro ] and [ fig : rmtcoru ] . notice that even small parametric changes in the hamiltonian can rapidly destroy the correlation of peak heights obtained from thermal averaging .",
    "this effect can be made more quantitative by calculating the half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of the correlator @xmath88 as a function of temperature ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rmtnc ] ) .",
    "small deformations @xmath89 exclusively due to shape variations are reported in a recent experiment @xcite where , in addition , a theoretical curve solely based on `` static '' gaussian ensembles ( @xmath90 ) is used to explain the data .",
    "although the parametric deformation for this experimental set up is relatively small , one should not disregard its importance : for @xmath91 we already observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmtnc ] a much slower increase in correlation versus temperature than for @xmath92 , in agreement with the data of ref .  . a fully consistent , parametric rmt for the peak height fluctuations yields a _ smaller _ correlation length than what is predicted by the `` static '' gaussian ensembles",
    "this is a clear indication that the theoretical curve shown together with the correlation length data in ref .",
    "should be taken with reservation .",
    "nevertheless , the inclusion of parametric deformations alone does not solve the discrepancy between the rmt predictions and the experimental data at small temperatures .",
    "another important statistical measure of the peak height fluctuation is its distribution . in figs .",
    "[ fig : rmtdisto ] and [ fig : rmtdistu ] we show the distributions for both goe and gue cases .",
    "the inset illustrates the dependence on deformations for a given temperature .",
    "we observe that , contrary to the correlation lengths of peak heights , the distributions are not affected by parametric deformations , but do depend strongly on temperature .",
    "for @xmath93 the distribution moves towards a gaussian shape .",
    "it is important to notice that rmt captures the qualitative aspects of the temperature dependence observed experimentally,@xcite but fails quantitatively : the data shows a smaller fluctuation in peak heights at high temperatures ( @xmath94 ) than the theory predicts .",
    "this could be interpreted as an indication that for such temperatures many - body ( or dephasing ) effects become important.@xcite    we conclude that a theory based solely on random matrices with a proper thermal average is not capable of explaining simultaneously the peak height distribution and correlations .",
    "even before attempting to improve the theory by including many - body interaction effects , we shall investigate whether nonuniversal aspects of the underlying single - particle dynamics also play an important role and lead to additional peak height correlation mechanisms .",
    "in this section we investigate how single - particle dynamical correlations statistically influence the conductance peak heights .",
    "we first examine how universal chaotic wave function correlations @xcite manifest on the conductance autocorrelation function .",
    "these correlations go beyond rmt theory , but are universal in the sense that they arise for any chaotic quantum state with finite wavelength .",
    "we show analytically that at @xmath95 the effect is small , but is enhanced at higher temperatures .",
    "we also investigate if peak height bunching can be explained by eigenstates localized in coordinate space .",
    "such localization corresponds to wave functions with amplitudes concentrated along certain periodic orbits of the underlying classical hamiltonian .",

    "this description implies that , close to the dot , the leads should be narrow and carry a single propagating channel .",
    "alternatively , we use the standard @xmath99-matrix formalism to calculate the decay width for extended leads by taking the overlap integral over the contact area : @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the channel @xmath102 wave function .",
    "both models assume that the barrier penetration factors are small , such that @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that the penetration factors vary smoothly with energy and can thus be incorporated in @xmath104 without affecting fluctuations .      a recent work by narimanov and collaborators @xcite explored the idea that the short time dynamics can influence peak height conductance fluctuations . using the semiclassical theory they derived a correction to the conductance in the absence of magnetic field and @xmath105 which provides a particularly strong effect on the tails of the autocorrelation function .",

    "the wave functions of integrable systems are strongly concentrated around classical tori , and the latter are only smoothly distorted by a parametric variation of the hamiltonian .",
    "this behavior is generic , provided the system stays integrable upon the parametric variation .",
    "however , as the parameter @xmath68 is varied , levels cross each other .",
    "since they correspond to different sets of quantum numbers , the typical crossing distance is much smaller than the distance necessary to appreciably change the wave functions .",
    "let us assume that in certain system there are levels very weakly influenced by changes in @xmath68 .",
    "we call them  horizontal \" levels @xmath140 .",
    "( any @xmath140 level certainly has a quite marked wave function structure with respect to the system geometry . )",
    " horizontal \" levels may cross generic levels , as the parameter @xmath68 is varied .",
    "let us assume now that the conductance peak of a dot containing @xmath0 electrons is dominated by a certain @xmath140 level for some value of @xmath68 .",
    "if the typical @xmath6 caused by the addition of one extra electron to the dot is of the order of the average parametric distance between crossings , the @xmath140 level will always stay very close to the fermi energy . in this way , the sequence of conductance peaks are dominated by the very same  horizontal \" level and are thus expected to show correlations in heights .",
    "this mechanism @xcite is robust as long as the system dynamics is close to integrable .",
    "the restrictive condition of having exactly one anticrossing for @xmath6 can be relaxed if temperature is included.@xcite    in the case of chaotic systems , wave functions typically decorrelate after one level crossing.@xcite deviations of such universal behavior indicate the presence of scarred eigenstates . for such wave functions the mechanism described in the previous paragraph",
    "is applicable .",
    "however , one should be aware that if peak height correlations are explained by a non - universal feature they are not ubiquitous .    in what follows",
    "we shall exemplify such mechanism and investigate how often these situation occurs .",
    "moreover , by changing shape , position of the contacts , and temperature , we nearly exhaust all sources of peak height correlations within the single - particle scenario .",
    "the results are compared with those of rmt and the available experimental data .      in order to investigate both aforementioned mechanisms",

    "the model is flexible enough to allow for different classical behaviors .",
    "for instance , if we take @xmath144 the system is integrable .",
    "as we increase the value of @xmath128 our model hamiltonian becomes very similar to the well - known stadium billiard , one of the paradigms of classical chaotic systems . for @xmath145 the equipotential",
    "@xmath146 corresponds to the border of the hard walled stadium billiard with unit radius and unit rectangular length .",
    "we model changes in the single - particle potential by varying @xmath147 , the length of the rectangular part of the well .",
    "the classical motion is chaotic if @xmath147 is varied in the interval range @xmath148 , provided we choose @xmath149 and stay in the energy window around @xmath150 .",
    "indeed , for this energy and parameter values the classical phase space is mostly chaotic , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : poincare ] , though small remnants of integrability still exist .    finally , to assure that the single - particle levels we analyze correspond to a classically chaotic motion , we fix @xmath151 in order to have a window of energy around @xmath152 containing typically 100 eigenstates of our hamiltonian .",
    "the quantum eigenstates are obtained by numerical diagonalization .",
    "the problem is solved by using as basis states the eigenfunctions of a sufficiently large rectangular box . when the index @xmath128 is an integer number , the calculation of the matrix elements is straightforward .",
    "the secular matrices are taken large enough such as to guarantee the convergence of all eigenvalues we analyze within 1% of the mean level spacing .",
    "this gives us confidence that the computed wave functions have converged .",
    "after ordering the eigenvalues in ascending energies , we consider only the eigenstates between the 200th and the 300th levels .",
    "a representative region of the spectrum of the smooth stadium with @xmath149 , in the absence of an external magnetic field , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spaguetti ]",
    ".    quantum calculations including a magnetic field @xmath153 perpendicular to the stadium are also of simple implementation in this model . by the usual minimum ansatz @xmath154 with @xmath155",
    "we obtain a new hamiltonian that can be diagonalized following the same numerical procedure .",
    "we found useful to work in the gauge where @xmath156 $ ] with @xmath157 .",
    "of course , the converged results do not depend on a particular choice of the gauge .",
    "however , the numerics can be made more efficient by choosing @xmath158 close to the geometrical center of the stadium and @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the lengths of the classically allowed region of the billiard at @xmath150 . with this choice , we obtain the largest ratio of number of converged eigenvalues to size of the secular matrix .",
    "we followed ref .   to estimate the magnitude of the time - reversal breaking magnetic flux @xmath162 threading the stadium . at the fermi energy we obtain @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the unit flux quantum . when comparing the results of the dynamical model against the rmt unitary case , we fix the magnetic field to be @xmath165 , where @xmath109 is the classical allowed area for an electron with energy @xmath29 .    although the system is chaotic , there are many very narrow avoided crossings , which are characterized by a gap @xmath166 .",
    "these crossings occur for only a few eigenstates , indicating that the latter are very weakly coupled to others eigenstates .",
    "this non - universal feature is well - known in quantum chaos and is a fingerprint of scarred wave functions .",
    "scarred eigenstates have the property of concentrating wave function amplitudes along certain classical periodic orbits . upon a parametric variation and after a level crossing ,",
    "scarred eigenstates preserve their strong identity . in view of fig .",
    "[ fig : spaguetti ] , we can apply the mechanism proposed for integrable systems in ref .   to explain strong peak - to - peak correlations .",
    "we identify the @xmath140 levels with scarred  horizontal \" states . the states that contribute to the conductance in the case where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spaguetti ] by dots .",
    "the two sequences shown correspond to different fermi energies .",
    "the wave functions related to the lower energy sequence are concentrated along the family of periodic orbits that bounce from @xmath169 to @xmath170 with @xmath171 ( the so called bouncing ball modes ) .",
    "the corresponding conductance peak heights show very large peak - to - peak correlations when the leads are placed such as to intersect these bouncing trajectories .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bouncingball ] .",
    "notice that for small temperatures the mechanism holds even if the scarred state does not correspond to the fermi level , but is its neighbor .",
    "this happens because scarred levels show very weak level repulsion and very often contribute significantly to the canonical occupation factor at @xmath172 .",
    "( differences in @xmath88 due to spectral fluctuations were already discussed in [ sec : rmt ] ) .",
    "the proposed mechanism holds for chaotic systems if three main conditions are met .",
    "first , the tunneling state at the fermi energy has to be localized in coordinate space .",
    "second , @xmath6 has to be close to @xmath173 to keep this state close to @xmath29 .",
    "third , the leads have to be in the region where the wave function has an enhanced amplitude . in practice , these conditions are obviously difficult to be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "however , one could imagine that a given sequence can have few correlated peaks dominated by a particular scarred state .",
    "when this state drifts away from the fermi level it will eventually be replaced by another localized state . in this way",
    "a peak height sequence would have several regions where peaks are strongly correlated .",
    "this is the kind of effect that we actually tried to identify . although we observed sequences like that in the numerical simulations , the proposed mechanism is not generically robust .",
    "when one averages over many sequences by varying the positions of the contacts inside the billiard , the fermi level , as well as @xmath174 .",
    "the autocorrelation functions @xmath88 dependence on @xmath175 does not differ much from the rmt result .",
    "in other words , sequences like the top one in fig .  [",
    "fig : spaguetti ] are statistically dominant .    summarizing : chaotic systems like the stadium can , in some cases , display strong peak - to - peak correlations . such cases , however , are statistically rare and in our opinion this mechanism is not robust enough to explain the experimental data.@xcite    let us now turn to the study of long range correlations . for this purpose we evaluated @xmath88 for the smooth stadium without magnetic field .",
    "deformations which cause energy levels to change by @xmath3 are very small at the classical level and do not influence our results .",
    "we therefore only consider the case of @xmath176 .",
    "the data set consists of 60 sequences of 100 peaks each .",
    "the peaks in each sequence are normalized to unit average height .",
    "this is done to avoid the systematic errors due to the decrease of the mean conductance from one sequence to another ( since each sequence corresponds to a different length @xmath147 ) .",
    "a correlator is calculated for each sequence and an average over all sequences is taken . for @xmath177",
    "no undershooting is observed in @xmath88 , as predicted in sec .",

    "[ fig : longcorr ] .",
    "we do not know how to estimate the magnitude of the oscillations in @xmath88 after the temperature average , since @xmath26 enters in the expressions in a convoluted manner . in fig .",
    "[ fig : longcorr ] we observe much larger oscillations than predicted by the theory at @xmath177 .",
    "we can check if the enhanced oscillations are related to the mechanism proposed in [ sec : weak ] , by verifying if @xmath179 ( the position of the anticorrelation maximum ) is consistent with our theory .",
    "our data were obtained by sweeping @xmath180 and keeping the lead positions fixed . for spinless electrons in a billiard , @xmath181 .",
    "to add one electron to the dot , we have to move up in energy by @xmath3 in our model .",
    "this corresponds to change @xmath180 by @xmath182 . using the parameters of our calculations",
    ", we then estimate the position of the maximal anticorrelation to be @xmath183 , which has to be contrasted with fig .",
    "[ fig : longcorr ] .",
    "a similar exercise was done in ref .",
    "using realistic values to estimate @xmath179 from the experimental data , obtaining values in reasonable agreement with ref .  .",
    "in our work , anticorrelations in @xmath88 can not be ruled out for small values of @xmath175 ; nevertheless , they have to increase at higher temperatures and this is observed in our numerical simulations .",
    "we postpone the presentation of this result to the next section , where we also discuss the possible statistical problems inherent to such study .",
    "the proper statistical treatment of experimental data is of great importance in any fluctuation analysis . in practical situations",
    "the number of coulomb blockade peaks in a sequence goes from 50 to 100 .",
    "therefore , the problem of biases and errors due to finite sample size is one of the major difficulties in calculating peak height autocorrelation functions . if a reliable estimate of the effective number of independent points @xmath184 can be made , the problem of making corrections and estimating errors is partially solved .",
    "considerable effort was devoted to this type of problem in the context of compound nucleus reactions ( see , for instance , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "in this case the observable of interest is the nuclear cross section , whose autocorrelation function is known to be lorentzian .",
    "let us translate this earlier estimate for the effective number of independent peaks into the language of coulomb blockade . for this purpose , we assume momentarily that the peak height autocorrelation function has a lorentzian shape",
    ". doing so and introducing @xmath185 , we can write the variance of the average conductance peak height as @xmath186,\\ ] ] where @xmath187 is the variance of the conductance peak height ( either the `` true '' variance or , for an estimate , the ensemble variance ) , whereas @xmath188 is the average over a sequence of @xmath128 peaks with a correlation length @xmath189 .",
    "it is known that if an average of @xmath184 independent data points is computed , the variance of this average is given by @xmath190 by comparing the two last equations , we can express @xmath184 in terms of @xmath191 . for values of @xmath192",
    ", @xmath184 is very well approximated by @xmath193 which tells us that an effective independent point is found after an interval of @xmath194 peaks .",
    "the statistical fluctuations are , as usual , given by @xmath195 .",
    "we expect our estimate of the number of effectively independent points to change little when a different functional form for the autocorrelation function is considered .",
    "the factor @xmath196 will be replaced by another numerical factor of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we illustrate this discussion by considering peak height autocorrelation functions obtained from sequences of different lengths for the smooth stadium without magnetic field or deformation for @xmath197 and @xmath198 . as temperature increases , so does @xmath189 ; statistical fluctuations become large even for samples with many peaks .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : appa2 ] . at @xmath199 , @xmath200 and each sequence of 25 peaks has @xmath201 and fluctuations prevail at @xmath202 .",
    "similar results are obtained when a magnetic field is included , but are not shown here .",
    "notice that the correlation length is more sensitive to small samples at high temperatures .",
    "for instance , at @xmath203 , @xmath189 decreases appreciably as we consider shorter sequences .",
    "however , at @xmath204 the correlation length ( defined as the hwhm ) is stable . as a consequence",
    ", the curve @xmath205 obtained from short sequences tends to saturate at high temperatures .",
    "this is similar to what is seen in ref .   for the dot with @xmath206 ( dot 2 ) , the smallest one among the three dots tested .",
    "our conclusion is that it is rather difficult to affirm unambiguously that the saturation of @xmath189 with temperature is a manifestation of decoherence",
    ". it may well be the effect of small statistics .",
    "any systematic search in the literature for single - particle models designed to explain the fluctuations of coulomb blockade peak heights will reveal a strong bias towards the assumption of chaos .",
    "very little attention has been devoted to integrable models , with , to the best of our knowledge , one exception.@xcite this is quite understandable since it is believed that , due to small irregularities in the confining potential or the presence of weak impurities , the electronic dynamics tends to be chaotic .",
    "in fact , it is particularly difficult to set up an experimental realization of an integrable system .",
    "this statement is corroborated by the fact that there is only one kind of conductance experiment that shows a clear distinction between integrable and chaotic underlying dynamics.@xcite however , this study , carried out by chang and collaborators , dealt with the weak localization peak in _ open _ quantum dots , i.e. , not in the coulomb blockade regime .    looking for clear fingerprints of integrable dynamics in the statistics of conductance in the coulomb blockade regime is probably not a well posed task .",
    "integrable systems are not universal , implying that each different confining potential will likely lead to very different conductance fluctuations . in this section",
    "we pursue the opposite strategy , asking if it is possible to tell from the conductance experimental data if the underlying dynamics is chaotic or not . to obtain some insight into this question",
    "we analyze two very simple systems , namely , the rectangular billiard ( a paradigm of integrable motion ) and the smooth stadium with @xmath144 .",
    "we model the coupling of the quantum dot to a given lead by a point contact at the position @xmath98 , which implies that the decay width of the @xmath20th state is proportional to @xmath207 . for billiards",
    "it is standard to solve the single - particle problem with neumann boundary conditions and to put the point contacts at the boundary.@xcite for chaotic systems one obtains equivalent results choosing the point contacts inside the dot , thus probing the  bulk \" of the single - particle wave functions . in this section",
    "we investigate both schemes .    for the rectangular billiard we can only proceed analytically in the regime where @xmath208 .",
    "the decay width of a state with quantum numbers @xmath209 is given by @xmath210 , up to a penetration factor . in the absence of an external magnetic field , in the `` bulk '' point contact model",

    "the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : squarefirst ] ) represent an average over the position of the point contact .",
    "one could object that this is not the kind of average taken in experiments .",
    "however , it turns out that by reducing the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : squarefirst ] ) to a single period in @xmath214 and @xmath215 , the wave function quantum numbers drop out of the integral and @xmath211 becomes independent of @xmath128 and @xmath216 . in this sense",
    ", we claim that the average in eq .",
    "( [ eq : squarefirst ] ) is equivalent to an average over a large number of wave functions with a fixed point contact position .    performing the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : squarefirst ] ) and writing the result in terms of @xmath217 , we arrive at @xmath218 which can be written in a closed form in terms of a complete elliptic integral of the first kind ( not shown here ) .    in a similar manner , we can calculate the distribution of decay widths @xmath211 for the rectangular billiard with point contacts placed at its sides , obtaining @xmath219 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pgamasquare ] we compare the analytical results of @xmath211 for the rectangle with the porter - thomas distribution , which is the rmt prediction for the orthogonal symmetry .",
    "in addition , we also display the numerical results for the smooth integrable stadium potential ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "the similarity between the bulk rectangle and the smooth stadium with the porter - thomas distribution ( in the absence of magnetic field ) can be understood by a simple argument .",
    "any wave function has a discrete number of points where its amplitude squared is a local maximum .",
    "it has also nodal lines where the amplitude is zero . by picking coordinates at random ,",
    "the probability for obtaining a small amplitude is much bigger than for a large amplitude .",
    "it has to be emphasized , however , that neither the bulk rectangle nor the smooth stadium are in perfect agreement with the porter - thomas distribution .",
    "although similar , there are differences that can be better visualized in a log - log plot ( not presented here ) , as shown before in the quantum chaos literature ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "the most interesting aspect of this analysis appears when we treat the distribution of conductance peak heights @xmath51 .",
    "we find that @xmath51 is relatively insensitive to @xmath211 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pgintegravel ] . analytical calculations are rather difficult in this case , since , in general , we do not know how to take into account correlations between the decay widths @xmath46 and @xmath45 for integrable systems .",
    "thus , the presented results were obtained numerically .",
    "notice that although the histograms are somewhat different from the rmt result , they become indistinguishable when the usual experimental uncertainties ( 5 - 10% ) are involved . ( to construct the histogram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pgintegravel ] we have used a very large sample of conductance peak heights . ) the apparent similarity between the rmt prediction and the result for integrable systems becomes even stronger if we take @xmath220 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pgintegravel]b .    from this analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the universal aspect observed experimentally for @xmath51 is more robust than initially predicted .",
    "we believe that there is a large class of integrable systems which lead to conductance peak distributions similar to rmt .",
    "this result is not very intuitive , since for most observables integrable systems show larger fluctuations than chaotic ones.@xcite we caution that our statement is _ not _ that _ any _ integrable system will display @xmath51 similar to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pgoeg ] ) and ( [ eq : pgueg ] ) .",
    "the literature already offers us a counter example : the conductance fluctuations observed in the model analyzed in ref .",
    "are certainly not compatible with rmt .",
    "in this work we aimed to study quantitatively how coulomb blockade conductance peak statistics can be understood within the single - particle plus constant interaction model .",
    "we showed that the distribution of peak heights predicted by the rmt is very robust to deformations in the dot effective potential .",
    "for @xmath221 we found that there are exist integrable systems which give equivalent results to rmt .",
    "the curves derived numerically from rmt reproduce fairly the experimental results at low temperatures ( for @xmath222 ) , with increasing discrepancies as temperatures rises .",
    "we also showed that the peak height long - range correlations can be understood in terms universal wave function correlations .",
    "the short range correlations remain an open problem . under certain circumstances",
    ", we were able to reproduce peak sequences with visible bunching of peak heights .",
    "their correlation lengths depend on the specific portion of the spectrum considered and is thus nonuniversal .",
    "unfortunately , such sequences are relatively rare , since they rely on the existence of well - connected scarred states .",
    "starting from non - degenerate sequences of eigenenergies and tunneling rates , one can construct spin - degenerate data sets by simply duplicating the original sequences . in this case , at @xmath223 the conductance peaks should appear in pairs of equal heights .",
    "more importantly , paired peaks would have a similar response to external perturbations , such as a magnetic field , even if their heights are not quite identical .",
    "experimentally , however , this behavior is not observed ( with the possible exception of fig .  2 in ref .  ) . in view of this fact ,",
    "we have decided for restricting our analysis to nondegenerate single - particle levels .",
    "it is noteworthy that the experiment by chang and collaborators @xcite is the only one where peak bunching is not visually strong .",
    "the main difference between the setup of ref .",
    "and others is the sample , which in this case has lower mobility .",
    "disorder destroys the dynamical effects we propose .",
    "one could then speculate that the lack of peak height correlations in ref .",
    ", and , perhaps , the departure from universality seen in other experiments depend on the strength of dynamical effects . from this perspective ,",
    "our main conclusion is negative , since , we were not able to identify a robust mechanism to explain such phenomena based on this idea .",
    "the hypothesis that the ground state and the excited states are uncorrelated and follow rmt leads always to the suppression of small conductance peak heights upon thermal averaging . even the inclusion of additional features , like deformations , does not change this conclusion . in view of the experimental evidences of an even larger suppression of the small peaks than predicted by rmt , we might conclude that the ground state and the first excited states have instead some correlation .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this could also be responsible for the correlations between ground states with consecutive number of electrons .",
    "thus , peak bunching and the persistence of small peaks could be manifestations of the same mechanism . from our analysis",
    ", however , such mechanism seems to be beyond the mean - field scenario . in conclusion , we believe that the full quantitative understanding of these effects may lay outside the single - particle approximation .    we thank c. marcus and s. patel for making the experimental data on the conductance peak sequences available to us .",
