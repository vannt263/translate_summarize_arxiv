    "the strength and ubiquity of the [ cii ] fine structure emission line makes it an important observational diagnostic of star formation in galaxies .",

    "thus , observations are rarely used to test the theoretical predictions .",
    "rather , the gas density and radiation field are deduced in some average sense by comparing spatially - unresolved emission lines to the models and requiring agreement .    moreover , for luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ) , the [ cii ] line ceases to be a reliable empirical calorimeter of star formation . instead a [ cii ] ` deficit ' is observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while this result is quantified by a number of relationships among semi - correlated observables , perhaps the most reasonable description is as a decreasing ratio of [ cii]/fir with increasing ir surface brightness @xcite , since ir surface brightness , which comprises both the energy injection by star formation and the compactness of a region , traces the heating rate in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the deficit also becomes more pronounced with an increasing ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath4 continuum flux , suggesting some relationship to the dust temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "] moreover , a similar behavior is observed for other pdr emission lines as well @xcite .",
    "several different explanations for this measured decline abound , including reduced photoelectric heating owing to positively - charged dust grains and absorption of ionizing and uv photons by dust in hii regions ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) , but these analyses seem to ignore the simplest and most obvious solution : the saturation of the upper energy level at gas temperatures much larger than that corresponding to the energy difference of the transition .",

    "@xcite further point out the importance of the relative filling factors of fir and [ cii ] in using the ratio of the two as a probe of the ism ; the fir emission is optically thick and comes from all gas containing dust , while the [ cii ] emission is optically thin but originates only from dissociated gas .",
    "however , the fraction of dissociated gas is challenging to compute theoretically .",

    "if not in this limit , @xmath42 would decrease , though  [ sec : cii ] demonstrates that galaxies exhibiting a [ cii ] deficit are likely in the high - temperature regime .",

    "additionally , equation  [ eq : fcii_obs ] double - counts the contribution from ` dark ' molecular gas in which the hydrogen is sufficiently self - shielded to be in molecular form but is still susceptible to co - dissociating radiation and , thus , emits in [ cii ] .",
    "this double counting occurs because both @xmath42 and @xmath43 include dark h@xmath44 . to correct for this , we should multiply @xmath43 by an additional factor of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the molecular and dark molecular gas fractions as defined in @xcite .",
    "however , the low value of @xmath43 adopted here as appropriate for lirgs and ulirgs implies that the dark fraction is small , which is consistent with theoretical calculations at high surface densities @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fractional change in @xmath42 accounting for the over - counted dark fraction is approximately @xmath48 .",
    "for example , if @xmath48 is as high as 0.3 , our estimate of @xmath42 increases only about @xmath49 , from 0.13 to 0.17 .",
    "finally , equation  [ eq : fcii_obs ] ignores gas in which the carbon may be in the form of ci rather than in co or cii .",

    "one possible issue with the above approach to calculating @xmath42 is that the @xcite model assumes clouds of discrete , shielded molecular gas bathed in an interstellar background , which may not be an appropriate description of the ism in lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "rather , high surface density systems are more likely represented by a ` swiss cheese ' picture in which relatively isolated pockets of pdr gas surround the hii regions of star clusters in a mostly molecular medium . in this case , the pdr gas is subject to the local cluster radiation field , which would be larger but more invariant from galaxy to galaxy than the large - scale background field",
    ". such a scenario may , thus , be observationally distinguished by temperature - dependent , [ oi]@xmath2 line emission and represent a way forward for analytic calculations to complement future high - resolution numerical simulations of star formation and hii regions in galaxies .",

    "the agreement is once again excellent , suggesting that the connection of the dust temperature to the [ cii ] deficit is as a large - scale quantity correlated to the specific fir emission ( see  [ sec : fir ] ) .",
    "several other explanations for the [ cii ] deficit appear in the literature . here , we briefly discuss and compare to high - temperature saturation the two main alternatives : ` dust - bounded ' hii regions (  [ sec : alt : dbhii ] ) and positively - charged dust grains (  [ sec : alt : pcdg ] ) . optically thick",

    "[ sec : deficit ] and required to produce figure  [ fig : ratio ] .      in the `",
    "dust - bounded ' hii region theory @xcite , dust in highly - ionized gas absorbs a significant fraction of the uv and ionizing photons .",
    "this results in both excess fir emission from dust inside the hii region and reduced photoelectric heating from pah molecules outside the hii region , which are starved of uv photons .",
    "this scenario is a popular explanation for the [ cii ] deficit because of its impact on dust temperature , which results in a decreasing [ cii]/fir ratio with increasing ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath4 continuum flux @xcite .",
    "moreover , it may help explain the behavior of the @xmath77 silicate feature  which increases in absorption strength with decreasing [ cii]/fir ratio  by creating a larger temperature disparity between dust inside and outside hii regions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , even for large dust optical depths in an hii region , a significant fraction of lyman - limit photons photo - ionize hydrogen instead of being intercepted by dust @xcite . moreover",
    ", radiation pressure can push dust out of giant hii regions around compact star clusters on short time scales if the gas is sufficiently dense ; for a cluster of @xmath78 o stars and an rms density of @xmath79 , the dust drift timescale is only @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "finally , the dust need not be significantly warmer than expected to explain the relationship between [ cii]/fir and @xmath74 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio1 ] shows that the warmer effective dust temperatures associated with galaxies of higher average surface star formation rates are sufficient to reproduce the observations .",
    "thus , neither the enhanced fir emission from hii regions nor the warmer dust temperatures provided by the ` dust - bounded ' hii region model are required by the data .      another oft - invoked mechanism to explain the [ cii ] deficit is saturation of the photoelectric heating rate due to positive charging of dust grains , while [ cii ] remains an otherwise reliable calorimeter @xcite . to describe this quantitatively ,",
    "consider that , in the limit where the grain charging is significant and @xmath81 , the photoelectric heating rate is proportional to @xmath82 as opposed to just @xmath29 in the case where grain charging has no effect .    as an illustrative exercise ,",
    "consider a comparison between galaxies with ir surface brightnesses of @xmath83 and those with @xmath84 , corresponding roughly to lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "if dust in the [ cii ] emitting gas is heated by a local star cluster , then @xmath29 is independent of average galaxy properties .",
    "however , if the gas is exposed to an average interstellar background , then @xmath29 is proportional to the surface star formation rate and the ir surface brightness",
    ". gas density should also scale as some function of @xmath85 ; assume @xmath41 and @xmath86 for our low- and high-@xmath69 cases , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", the gas temperature should be comparatively similar between the two groups , since whatever line dominates the pdr cooling is likely very temperature - sensitive , allowing it to compensate for any difference in the heating rate with only a small change in @xmath13 . combining these rough estimates , the heating rate in the high-@xmath69 galaxies is about a factor of 15 ( or about 5 if pdr gas is heated by a the local star cluster ) higher than that in the low-@xmath69 galaxies despite an increasing the surface star formation rate by a factor of 100 .",
    "however , in the regime when the photoelectric efficiency is reduced by grain charging , the [ cii ] emission is already nearly saturated .",
    "this is evident from the case considered in ",
    "[ sec : cii ] , in which conservative values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 produce an equilibrium gas temperature of @xmath87 . using these values , the second term in the denominator of equation  [ eq : hpe ] has a value of about 1.4 , indicating that grain charging is only just starting to become important .",
    "moreover , despite the reduced photoelectric efficiency , the heating rate still increases with @xmath60 . yet",
    ", figure  [ fig : ratio ] shows that the observed slope of the [ cii]/fir@xmath69 relation is consistent with no additional impact on the specific [ cii ] luminosity at higher @xmath60 .",
    "finally , while grain - charging is a robust mechanism for reducing the photoelectric efficiency , it is not clear that photoelectric heating is always the dominant contribution to the heating in pdr gas .",
    "for example , thermalization of free electrons produced during ionizations of the hydrogen gas by cosmic rays and hard x - rays may be more important , particularly if the photoelectric efficiency is reduced ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "note that this process also results in a heating rate proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , grain charging could play an important role in producing a deficit of other fir emission lines , especially of [ oi]@xmath2 , which saturates at much higher temperatures and densities than [ cii ] .",
    "such a mechanism might explain similarities among the suppression of these lines in a handful of systems with high fir / co(10 ) ratios @xcite .",
    "the decline in the [ cii]/fir ratio in lirgs and ulirgs with increasing ir surface brightness is simply a consequence of the quantum mechanics of the upper fine - structure energy state in cii , which saturates at gas temperatures much larger than @xmath0 , the temperature corresponding to the energy separation between the upper and lower states . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the upper state is not increasingly populated , and so the specific [ cii ] luminosity remains constant as both the specific fir luminosity and the ir surface brightness increase , with @xmath88 resulting from their relative dependences on surface star formation rate and surface density .",
    "this mechanism is a quantum mechanical necessity and must be at work independent of other possible contributions to the [ cii ] deficit , such as a diminished efficiency for photoelectic heating from positively charged dust grains or excess fir emission and reduced heating as a result of ` dust - bounded ' hii regions .",
    "while the slope of the [ cii]/fir@xmath69 relation is set by [ cii ] saturation and the star formation law , the normalization reveals that about 1017@xmath1 of the ism in lirgs and ulirgs is dissociated , [ cii]-traced gas .",
    "this fraction is roughly constant with surface density and consistent with observations of [ cii]/co(10 ) , which probe the ratio of atomic to molecular gas in the ism .",
    "however , this value is an order - of - magnitude larger than the prediction from models that assume interstellar gas is configured as discrete molecular clouds bathed in an external radiation field that dissociates gas from the outside - in . on the other hand , assuming that the structure of the molecular gas more closely resembles ` swiss cheese , ' with relatively disconnected pdr ` holes ' surrounding star clusters may represent a way forward for future calculations .",
    "these contrasting configurations likely have different signatures in the [ oi]@xmath2 line as well as important implications for the escape of ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium .",
    "we thank joaquin vieira and javier graci - carpio for providing the low - redshift goals data and the derived corresponding dust temperatures .",
    "the approximate rate of photoelectric heating from the dust , in which incident uv photons knock off electrons that subsequently thermalize with the gas , appears in equation  c5 from the appendix of @xcite as @xmath89 in the limit of @xmath90 , where @xmath29 is the fuv radiation field normalized to @xmath91 ( the value of the interstellar field in the solar neighborhood ) ; @xmath92 is the dust - to - gas ratio normalized to the galactic value ; @xmath93 ; @xmath94 is the electron density , which we take to be @xmath95 ; and @xmath96 is a parameter related to pah collision rates with a value of about 0.5 . in equation  [ eq : hpe ] , the second term in the denominator quantifies the reduced heating efficiency due to positively - charged dust grains ."

    "<S> we find that the [ cii ] deficit observed in the highest ir surface - brightness systems is a natural consequence of saturating the upper fine - structure transition state at gas temperatures above @xmath0 . to reproduce the measured amplitude of the [ cii]/fir ratio in deficit galaxies </S>",
    "<S> , we require that [ cii ] trace approximately 1017@xmath1 of all gas in these systems , roughly independent of ir surface brightness and consistent with observed [ cii ] to co(10 ) line ratios . calculating the value of this fraction </S>",
    "<S> is a challenge for theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty may reside in properly treating the topology of molecular and dissociated gas , different descriptions for which may be observationally distinguished by the [ oi]@xmath2 line in yet - to - be - probed regions of parameter space , allowing pdr emission lines from to probe not only the effects of star formation but also the state and configuration of interstellar gas .    </S>",
