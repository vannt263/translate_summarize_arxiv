    "black holes are the simplest objects in the universe and merging of binary black holes ( bbh ) can produce strong gravitational radiation .",
    "hence , bbh systems are ideal laboratories for exploring and testing strong field relativistic physics .",
    "there is a growing body of evidence that black holes exist on many mass scales , from stellar mass , up to @xmath7 a few @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "numerous clues , especially those provided by the hubble space telescope , suggest that almost every galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in its center ( e.g. , sarzi et al . 2001 ; pinkney et al . 2003 ) .",
    "according to the hierarchical merger scenario of galaxy evolution , coalescence is one of the most important processes in galaxy evolution and a typical galaxy may experience between one and several such episodes during its lifetime ( struck 1999 ) .",
    "merger of galaxies can bring two smbhs together eventually to form a bbh , which can survive for about one hubble time in spherical galaxies , axisymmetric galaxies or certain triaxial galaxies ( yu 2002 ) .",
    "therefore the presence of two smbhs in one galaxy forming supermassive bbh , should not be a rare phenomenon .",
    "enormous efforts have been made in recent years to find observational evidence for the existence of supermassive bbh .",
    "evidence is sought in two directions : spatially resolved systems where the bbh can be identified morphologically and unresolved systems where the existence of the bbh can be inferred in various ways ( see komossa 2003 for an extensive review ) .",
    "examples of the latter are as follows .",
    "winged or x - shaped radio sources were suggested to be bbh merger remnants ( e.g. , merritt & ekers 2002 ; wang et al .",
    "2003 ; liu , wu , & cao 2003 ) .",
    "helically distorted radio jets observed in some objects were interpreted sometimes as due to the orbital motion or precession of the black hole producing the jets ( e.g. , sudou et al .",
    "some bbh models predict the surface brightness of the host galaxies would decrease toward the galactic center and such an effect has indeed been observed in a few early - type galaxies ( e.g. lauer et al . 2002 ) .",
    "rather more direct evidence comes from resolved systems : several pairs of quasars with almost the same redshift and angular separations between @xmath10 have been observed and were taken to be real binary quasars .",
    "the projected physical distance between these potential binary quasars is usually a few ten kpc ( mortlock , webster , & francis 1999 ) .",
    "ngc 6240 is perhaps the only case where binary active nuclei are separately identified : the high resolution observation of chandra revealed two hard x - ray nuclei in this interesting object and the projected physical separation of about 1.4 kpc ( komossa et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is the smallest among known binary agn .",
    "as far as we know , no quasar pair with physical separation @xmath11 kpc has been yet found .    of the above lines of evidence for the existence of supermassive bbh ,",
    "binary agn is of particular interest .",
    "it must , however , be admitted that apart from ngc 6240 , the evidence so far can not be considered as conclusive and efforts must be continued to seek out suppermassive bbh . in this letter , we report the discovery of a new binary quasar candidate , sdss j104807.74 + 005543.5 ( hereafter sdss j1048 + 0055 ) .",
    "it is identified from the sloan digital sky survey data release 1 ( sdss dr1 , abazajian et al .",
    "2003 ) among @xmath12 low redshift galaxies that show double - peaked narrow emission lines , most of which are active .",
    "apart from the presence of such lines , the other piece of evidence that sustains the bbh interpretation is that its high angular resolution vlba image reveals two discrete radio sources , possibly corresponding to two different active nuclei .",
    "the [ oiii ] luminosity of the two nuclei are in the range for quasars .",
    "the discovery of sdss j1048 + 0055 and more than one hundred of double - peaked narrow line objects in the spectral dataset of the sdss dr1 might suggest that this be an effective way of selecting candidates of binary black holes with intermediate , sub - kpc separations .",
    "we postpone detailed analyse of the whole sample of double - peaked narrow emission lines to a forthcoming paper . throughout this letter",
    ", an @xmath1370 km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 cosmology is assumed .",
    "sdss j1048 + 0055 is observed by the sdss only because it is the counterpart of a first radio source and classified as qso by the spectroscopic pipeline of the sdss ( stoughton et al .",
    "it falls in the dr1 quasar catalog ( schneider et al .",
    "2003 ) due to its high luminosity ( @xmath18 ) and seemingly broad line width .",
    "the optical continuum of sdss j1048 + 0055 , which is rather noisy , is fitted with a power law .",
    "the fitted continuum is subtracted before measurement of the emission lines .",
    "because the [ oiii]@xmath194959 , 5007 doublets clearly show a double - peaked profile and a rather broad wing , the continuum subtracted spectrum in the h@xmath20 [ oiii]@xmath194959 , 5007 regime is fitted with @xmath21 gaussian components , i.e. , two sets of three gaussians for the two peaks and the broad wing of the [ oiii]@xmath224959,5007 doublets and one gaussian for h@xmath23 . within each set of the components for [ oiii ] ,",
    "the centroids of the three gaussians are forced to correspond to a same redshift ; their widths to a same doppler broadening ; also the intensity ratio of [ oiii]@xmath245007 to [ oiii]@xmath244959 is fixed at its theoretical value .",
    "the final fit is done through minimization of @xmath25 and the result is shown in figure 1 upper panel",
    ". the lower panel displays the [ oii]@xmath243727 line , which is the 2nd strongest after [ oiii]@xmath245007 .",
    "however , the [ oii ] line is single - peaked and can be satisfactorily modelled by a single gaussian .",
    "we would like to point out that h@xmath3 might also be double - peaked .",
    "when fitted with a single gaussian , its line width @xmath26 is much broader than [ oii ] and each of the [ oiii ] peaks .",
    "the line can be fitted , comparably , with the template of [ oiii ] line profile , other high ionization narrow lines , such as [ neiii]@xmath243869 and [ neiii ] @xmath243967 also seem to show double - peaked profile but higher quality spectral observation is needed to confirm this feature .",
    "we did not analyse other emission lines because the s / n ratio is not high enough for us to draw any significant conclusion .",
    "the measured line parameters are assembled in table 1 .",

    "it was observed at 1.4 ghz during nvss in 1995 - 02 ( condon et al . 1998 ) and during first in 1998 - 08 ( white et al .",
    "there is no significant difference in the flux observed on these two occasions ( @xmath52 mjy and @xmath53 mjy ) .",
    "this flux is also marginally consistent with an early measurement in the green bank 1.4 ghz northern sky survey , which is @xmath54 with uncertainty of @xmath55 mjy ( white & becker 1992 ) .",
    "however , the 4.85 ghz flux of @xmath56 mjy given in the mit - green bank 5 ghz survey catalog ( mgbs , bennett et al . 1986 ) is different ( at @xmath57 level ) from that presented by gregory & condon 1991 ( @xmath58 mjy ) , becker , white , & edwards 1991 ( @xmath59 mjy ) and griffith et al .",
    "1995 ( @xmath60 mjy ) .",
    "the flux difference between the mgbs and the later surveys can not be explained by the larger beamsize of mgbs ( fwhp@xmath61 ) : 1 ) because the source is compact , and 2 ) because within @xmath62 of the source nvss detected no other sources while first only detected two with insignificant fluxes around 1 mjy .",
    "it seems likely that this variation with an amplitude @xmath63 is real .",
    "this interpretation is , moreover , consistent with its compact morphology and its flat spectrum .",
    "the overall radio spectrum is moderately flat with a spectral slope of @xmath64 ( s@xmath65 ) .",
    "the radio luminosity between @xmath66 ghz , @xmath67 erg s@xmath14 , is quite high even for a radio - loud quasar .",
    "the flatness of the spectrum is consistent with the compact radio morphology .",
    "it is unresolved by first at angular resolution @xmath68 5.4 .",
    "this object is also observed by the vlba calibrator survey ( vcs1 , beasley et al .",
    "2002 ) and remains unresolved at 2.3 ghz with resolution ellipse of @xmath69 milliarcsecs .",
    "however , the higher resolution 8.4 ghz radio image ( @xmath70 milliarcsecs ) clearly shows two compact sources with the west source @xmath68 30 times stronger than the east one ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the angular offset between the two sources is about 2.5 milliarcsecs , corresponding to a projected physical distance of @xmath1 pc at a redshift of 0.6422 derived from the [ oii ] and @xmath40 emission line .",
    "the large difference in the radio flux , the small angular separation and flat spectrum conspire to indicate that we are dealing with possible two separate radio sources , rather than with two lobes of a single source .",
    "further measurement of the radio spectrum of the weak component would be necessary to confirm this .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of the double - peaked profile of [ oiii]@xmath714959,5007 is that they come from two distinct narrow emission line regions ( nlr ) around two active nuclei .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath725007 luminosity of the red and blue peaks , @xmath5,red}\\approx 2.8\\times 10^{42}$ ] erg s@xmath14 and @xmath5,blue}\\approx 3.6\\times 10^{42 } $ ] erg s@xmath14 , is comparable to that of luminous quasars in the bqs sample , and at least 10 times more luminous than seyfert galaxies .",
    "sdss j1048 + 0055 is rather faint in the optical in comparison with the radio .",
    "the flux ratio of radio to optical or the radio - loudness , @xmath73 , is extraordinarily large .",
    "such a large rl implies that the nuclear emission in the optical is heavily obscured .",
    "the radio morphology also suggests that two active nuclei may be present in the center of sdss j1048 + 0055 as was pointed out in the last section .",
    "if the two discrete radio sources revealed by vlba proved to be stationary and if the weak component also shows flat spectrum by further vlbi observations , thereby thus confirming their bbh status , then we can say that the separation between the bbh should not be much larger than tens of pc .",
    "then sdss j1048 + 0055 would be the only galaxy harboring bbh with such a small separation and the system may be at the last stage before the two nuclei ( bhs ) become a bound system ( yu 2002 ) .",
    "the fact that [ oiii]@xmath2 show double - peaked profile while [ oii]@xmath74 does not is understandable because high ionization emission line regions are often more compact than low ionization ones .",
    "it is likely that double - peaked [ oiii ] emission line is mainly concentrated in the two cores of nlr whose centers coincide with the two radio peaks while the narrower and single - peak [ oii ] may be emitted by the whole nlr .",
    "therefore sdss j1048 + 0055 would most likely be a galaxy merger with two quasar cores in its central region .",
    "[ [ the - efficiency - of - finding - bbh - using - double - peaked - narrow - emission - lines ] ] the efficiency of finding bbh using double - peaked narrow emission lines ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    now that most galaxies harbor a supermassive black hole and the frequency of galaxy collisions is relatively high , closely bound bbh in a single galaxy should not be a rare occurrence .",
    "theoretical calculations show that coalescence of two black hole goes through several stages .",
    "dynamic friction causes the black holes along with their surrounding stellar cluster to approach each other .",
    "as the stars in the cluster being stripped off , the the two black holes form a bbh .",
    "some bbh will further lose angular momentum through the scattering of passing - by stars , but analysis shows that some bbh can survive for about one hubble time in large , spherical galaxies and the orbital velocities of the surviving bbh are generally believed to be @xmath75 km s@xmath14 ( yu 2002 ; c.f .",
    ", milosavljevi ' c & merritt 2003 ) .",
    "detection of supermassive bbh and the estimation of the frequency of such events can provide important constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "now , the evolution timescale of bbh is extremely uneven .",
    "a sharp rise occurs at @xmath76 pc and the timescales for a separation of @xmath77 a few pc are several orders of magnitude greater than for @xmath78 pc ( yu 2002 ) .",
    "the time it takes a bbh of similar masses to evolve from a few kpc to @xmath76 pc is @xmath79 yr , and this time increase with increasing mass ratio of the bbh .",
    "therefore , even every galaxy experiences a major merger during its lifetime and most of bbh survive , the absolute majority would have separation @xmath77 a few pc , which is beyond the resolution limit of most of present instruments .",
    "while double nuclei with separation of several kpc or larger have been identified in some galaxies , however , bbh with separation @xmath80pc have not been found yet .",
    "it is likely that merging will trigger the activity of both black holes at intermediate separations .",
    "gas concentration and starburst activity in the nuclei were observed in interacting galaxies at even large separation ( e.g. , gao & solomon 2003 ) , and a pair of binary agn are detected in ngc 6240 .",
    "the associated star - cluster or bulge around each black hole may survive in a fraction of such systems at this distance . thus each nucleus may well possess its own nlr . in this case ,",
    "our calculations show that about 5 - 10% of such systems will be found as double - peaked sources under the generic assumption of virialization of nlr .",
    "if a significant fraction of agn are indeed in such merging systems , a few percent of agn should show double - peaked line profile .",
    "we found @xmath68 100 objects that shows this feature in at least one narrow line from the subsample of @xmath81 sdss galaxies and quasars that either [ oiii ] or h@xmath82 have s / n ratio @xmath83 .",
    "the fraction of such objects is about 1% , and increases with the level of nuclear activity .",
    "hence , the simple model estimation is quite consistent with the result of observation .",
    "the model and the sample will be described in detail elsewhere .",
    "we would like to point out that the bbh interpretation for sdss j1048 + 0055 , as well as for the other objects in our double - peaked narrow line sample , is certainly not the only one .",
    "two other possible interpretations are bipolar outflow and a disk - like emission line region .",
    "the latter seems unlikely because the compact structure and flat spectrum of sdss j1048 + 0055 suggest that the system is observed face - on , while an inclined disk is required to explain the double peaked profile in sdss j1048 + 0055 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bipolar outflow interpretation is correct , then we can only explain the weaker radio source as a one - sided jet like that of 2255 - 282 which is an optical variable radio source .",
    "for the latter , a jet is revealed by vlba in the 5 ghz image and its 15 ghz images show radio structure similar to that of the former ( zensus et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the vlba radio image of sdss j1048 + 0055 was taken some 8 years ago , hence , another high angular resolution radio image can tell whether this is indeed the case .    about @xmath84 of the objects in our double - peaked narrow line sample",
    "are detected in the radio by the first and @xmath76 objects , including sdss j1048 + 0055 and sdss j094144.82 + 575123.7 , have radio flux @xmath85 mjy .",
    "according to the estimates made in  3.3 , some of these objects should be resolved into two discrete radio sources at @xmath7 milliarcsec resolution if the bbh interpretation is indeed correct .",
    "a sizable fraction of the objects in our sample may also be resolved in the optical by hst .",
