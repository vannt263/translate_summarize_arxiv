    "the discovery of electron spin is one of the most interesting stories in the history of quantum mechanics ; told e.g. in van der waerden s contribution to the pauli memorial volume ( @xcite , pp.199 - 244 ) , in tomonaga s book @xcite , and also in various first - hand reports @xcite@xcite @xcite .",
    "this story also bears fascinating relations to the history of understanding special relativity .",
    "one such relation is given by thomas discovery of what we now call `` thomas precession '' @xcite@xcite , which explained for the first time the correct magnitude of spin - orbit coupling and hence the correct magnitude of the fine - structure split of spectral lines , and whose mathematical origin can be traced to precisely that point which marks the central difference between the galilei and the lorentz group ( this is e.g. explained in detail in sects.4.3 - 4.6 of @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "i will dwell a little on another such connection to special relativity .    as is widely appreciated , wolfgang pauli is a central figure , perhaps _ the _ most central figure , in the story of spin .",
    "being the inventor of the idea of an inner ( quantum mechanical ) degree of freedom of the electron , he was at the same time the strongest opponent to attempts to relate it to any kind of interpretation in terms of kinematical concepts that derive from the picture of an extended material object in a state of rotation . to my knowledge ,",
    "pauli s hypothesis of this new intrinsic feature of the electron , which he cautiously called `` a classical non - describable two valuedness '' , was the first instance where a quantum - mechanical degree of freedom was claimed to exist without a corresponding classical one .",
    "this seems to be an early attempt to walk without the crutches of some ` correspondence principle ' .",
    "even though the ensuing developments seem to have re - installed  mentally at least  the more classical notion of a spinning electron through the ideas of ralph kronig ( compare section  4 of vanderwaerden s contribution to @xcite , pp.209 - 216 ) and , independently , samuel goudsmit and george uhlenbeck @xcite@xcite , pauli was never convinced , despite the fact that he lost the battle against thomas and declared `` total surrender '' in a letter to bohr written on march 12 .",
    "1926 ( @xcite , vol.i , doc.127 , pp.310 ) . for pauli",
    "the spin of the electron remained an abstract property which receives its ultimate and irreducible explanation in terms of group theory , as applied to the subgroup of spatial rotations ( or its double cover ) within the full symmetry group of space - time , may it be the galilei or the lorentz group ( or their double cover ) . or as faithful true representations ( i.e. ` single - valued ' ) of its double - cover group @xmath0 , which are subgroups of the galilei and lorentz groups or their double - cover groups respectively .",

    "in fact , he kept on arguing fiercely against what in a letter to sommerfeld from december 1924 he called `` model prejudices '' ( @xcite , vol.i , doc.72 , p.182 ) and did not refrain from ridiculing the upcoming idea of spin from the very first moment ( cf .",
    "what pauli accepted was the idea of the electron possessing an intrinsic magnetic moment and angular momentum , the latter being interpreted _ exclusively _ in a formal fashion through its connection with the generators of the subgroup of rotations within the lorentz group , much like we nowadays view it in modern relativistic field theory .",
    "to some extent it seems fair to say that , in this case , pauli was a pioneer of the modern view according to which abstract concepts based on symmetry - principles are seen as primary , whereas their concrete interpretation in terms of localised material structures , to which e.g. the kinematical concept of ` rotation ' in the proper sense applies , is secondary and sometimes even dispensable .",
    "but one should not forget that this process of emancipation was already going on in connection with the notion of classical fields , as einstein used to emphasise , e.g. , in his 1920 leiden address `` ether and the theory of relativity '' ( @xcite , vol.7 , doc.38 , pp.308 - 320 ) .",
    "we will come back to this point below .",
    "besides being sceptical in general , pauli once also made a _",
    "specific _ remark as to the inadequateness of classical electron models ; that was three years after thomas note , in a footnote in the addendum to his survey article `` general foundations of the quantum theory of atomic structure '' , that appeared 1929 as chapter 29 in ` mller - pouillets lehrbuch der physik ' .",

    "but before giving a self - contained account , i wish to recall pauli s classic paper of december 1924 , where he introduced his famous `` classically non - describable two - valuedness '' .",
    "we begin by recalling the notion of _ gyromagnetic ratio_. consider a ( not necessarily continuous ) distribution of mass and charge in the context of pre - special - relativistic physics , like , e.g. , a charged fluid or a finite number of point particles .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the corresponding velocity field with respect to an inertial frame and @xmath8 and @xmath9 the density distributions of electric charge and mass corresponding to the total charge @xmath10 and mass @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the total angular momentum is given by ( @xmath12 denotes the antisymmetric vector product ) @xmath13 the electric current distribution , @xmath14 , is the source of a magnetic field which at large distances can be approximated by a sum of multipole components of increasingly rapid fall - off for large distances from the source .",
    "the lowest possible such component is the dipole .",
    "it has the slowest fall - off ( namely @xmath15 ) and is therefore the dominant one at large distances .",
    "( a monopole contribution is absent due to the lack of magnetic charges . )",
    "the dipole field is given by and @xmath16 will appear explicitly . note that @xmath17 and that @xmath18 _ exactly _ , where c stands for ` coulomb ' , the unit of charge . ]",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and where @xmath22 denotes the magnetic dipole moment of the current distribution , which is often ( we shall follow this ) just called _ the _ magnetic moment : @xmath23 note the similarity in structure to ( [ eq : introangmom ] ) , except for the additional factor of 1/2 in front of  ( [ eq : defmagnmoment ] ) .",
    "the _ gyromagnetic ratio _ of a stationary mass and charge current - distribution , @xmath24 , is defined to be the ratio of the moduli of @xmath22 and @xmath25 : @xmath26 we further define a dimensionless quantity @xmath3 , called the _ gyromagnetic factor _ , by @xmath27 these notions continue to make sense in non - stationary situations if @xmath22 and @xmath25 are slowly changing ( compared to other timescales set by the given problem ) , or in ( quasi ) periodic situations if @xmath22 and @xmath25 are replaced by their time averages , or in mixtures of those cases where , e.g. , @xmath25 is slowly changing and @xmath22 rapidly precesses around @xmath25 ( as in the case discussed below ) .",
    "an important special case is given if charge and mass distributions are strictly proportional to each other , i.e. , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is independent of @xmath30 .",
    "then we have @xmath31 in particular , this would be the case if charge and mass carriers were point particles of the same charge - to - mass ratio , like @xmath32 particles of one sort , where @xmath33 after these preliminaries we now turn to pauli s paper .      on december 2nd 1924",
    ", pauli submitted a paper entitled `` on the influence of the velocity dependence of the electron mass upon the zeeman effect '' ( @xcite , vol.2 , pp.201 - 213 ) to the zeitschrift fr physik . in that paper",
    "he starts with the general observation that for a point particle of rest - mass @xmath11 and charge @xmath10 , moving in a bound state within a spherically symmetric potential , the velocity dependence of mass , @xmath34 affects the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "here @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "the application he aims for is the anomalous zeeman effect for weak magnetic fields , a topic on which he had already written an earlier paper , entitled on the rules of the anomalous zeeman effect ( @xcite , vol.2 , pp.151 - 160 ) , in which he pointed out certain connections between the weak - field case and the theoretically simpler case of a strong magnetic field .",
    "note that `` weak '' and `` strong '' here refers to the standard set by the inner magnetic field caused by the electrons orbital motion , so that `` weak '' here means that the zeeman split is small compared to the fine - structure .",
    "since the charge is performing a quasi periodic motion , its magnetic moment due to its orbital motion is given by the time average ( i will denote the time average of a quantity @xmath37 by @xmath38 ) @xmath39 on the other hand , its angular momentum is given by @xmath40 it is constant if no external field is applied and slowly precessing around the magnetic field direction if such a field is sufficiently weak , thereby keeping a constant modulus .",
    "hence we can write @xmath41 where the averaging period is taken to be long compared to the orbital period of the charge , but short compared to the precession period of @xmath25 if an external magnetic field is applied .",
    "this gives @xmath42 where with the lorentz factor @xmath43 , which nowadays is usually abbreviated by @xmath44 , though not in the present paper . ]",
    "@xmath45 more specifically , pauli applies this to the case on an electron in the coulomb field of a nucleus .",
    "hence @xmath11 from now on denotes the electron mass .",
    "its charge is @xmath46 , and the charge of the nucleus is @xmath47 . using the virial theorem",
    ", he then gives a very simple derivation of @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the electron s total energy ( kinetic plus potential ) .",
    "for the quantised one - electron problem , an explicit expression for @xmath49 in terns of the azimuthal quantum number @xmath50 ( @xmath51 in modern notation , where @xmath52 is the quantum number of orbital angular - momentum ) and the principal quantum number @xmath53 ( @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the radial quantum number ) was known since sommerfeld s 1916 explanation of fine structure ( see , e.g. , @xcite , p.53 , formula ( 17 ) ) .",
    "hence pauli could further write : @xmath56 where the approximation refers to small values of @xmath57 and where @xmath58 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "for higher @xmath59 one obtains significant deviations from the classical value @xmath60 . for example",
    ", @xmath61 gives @xmath62 .",
    "the relativistic correction factor @xmath44 affects the angular frequency .",
    "this is also related to our usage of @xmath63 rather than @xmath64 ( planck s constant ) . ]",
    "with which the magnetic moment created by the electron s orbital motion will precess in a magnetic field of strength @xmath65 .",
    "this angular frequency is now given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the larmor ( angular ) frequency : @xmath68 here we explicitly wrote down the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath69 , for of the electron s orbital motion even though @xmath70 , just to keep track of its appearance .",
    "the energy for the interaction of the electron with the magnetic field now likewise receives a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "pauli now applies all this to the `` core model '' for atoms with a single valence electron . according to the simplest version of this model , the total angular momentum ,",
    "@xmath25 , and the total magnetic moment , @xmath22 , are the vector sums of the angular and magnetic momenta of the core ( indicated here by a subscript @xmath71 ) and the valence electron ( indicated here by a subscript @xmath72 ) :    [ eq : totalmomenta ] @xmath73    the relations between the core s and electron s magnetic momenta on one side , and their angular momenta on the other , are of the form    [ eq : relationsmomenta ] @xmath74    the point is now that @xmath22 is not a multiple of @xmath25 if @xmath75 . assuming a constant @xmath25 for the time being , this means that @xmath22 will precess around @xmath25 .",

    "its quantum analog is obtained by replacing @xmath79 and correspondingly for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which is then called the _ land factor _ @xmath82 . hence @xmath83",
    "all this is still right to a good approximation if @xmath25 is not constant , but if its frequency of precession around the direction of the ( homogeneous ) external field is much smaller than the precession frequency of @xmath22 around @xmath25 , which is the case for sufficiently small external field strength .",
    "basically through the work of land it was known that @xmath84 fitted the observed multiplets of alkalies and also earth alkalies quite well .",
    "this value clearly had to be considered anomalous , since the magnetic moment and angular momentum of the core were due to the orbital motions of the electrons inside the core , which inevitably would lead to @xmath85 , as explained in section[sec : preliminaries ] .",
    "this was a great difficulty for the core model at the time , which was generally referred to as the `` magneto - mechanical anomaly '' .",
    "pauli pointed out that one could either say that the physical value of the core s gyromagnetic factor is twice the normal value , or , alternatively , that it is obtained by adding 1 to the normal value .",
    "these two ways of looking at the anomaly suggested two different ways to account for the relativistic correction , which should only affect that part of the magnetic moment that is due to the orbital motion of the inner electrons , that is , the ` normal ' part of @xmath86 .",
    "hence pauli considered the following two possibilities for a relativistic correction of @xmath86 , corresponding to the two views just outlined : @xmath87 then comes his final observation , that neither of these corrections are compatible with experimental results on high-@xmath59 elements by runge , paschen and back , which , like the low-@xmath59 experiments , resulted in compatibility with ( [ eq : landefactor ] ) only if @xmath84 . in a footnote",

    ", it is well known that the principle of minimal coupling applied to the pauli equation leads just as natural to @xmath4 as in case of the dirac equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , p.37 ) . also , the very concept of spin has as natural a home in classical physics as in quantum physics if one starts from equally general and corresponding group - theoretic considerations.the spaces of states in quantum and classical mechanics are hilbert spaces and symplectic manifolds respectively .",

    "let me repeat the question : in what sense do the actual values of the electron parameters , mass , charge , intrinsic angular - momentum , and gyromagnetic factor , resist classical modelling in the framework of special relativity ?",
    "in this section we will give a self - contained summary of the basic features of simple electron models .",
    "the first model corresponds to that developed by abraham  @xcite , which was mentioned by goudsmit and uhlenbeck as already explained.since we are mainly concerned with the spin aspects , we will ignore the differences between abraham s and , say , lorentz model ( rigid versus deformable ) , which become important as soon as translational motions are considered .",
    "we mention abraham not for any preference for his ` rigid ' model , but for the reason that he considered rotational motion explicitly .",
    "its interaction with the translational motion was further worked out in detail by schwarzschild in  @xcite , but this is not important here . ]",
    "we will see that this model can only account for @xmath3 factors in the interval between @xmath96 and @xmath97 if superluminal speeds along the equator are to be avoided .",
    "we also critically discuss the assumption made by goudsmit and uhlenbeck that this ( i.e. abraham s ) model predicts @xmath4 .",
    "since this model neglects the stresses that are necessary to prevent the charge distribution from exploding , we also discuss a second model in which such stresses ( corresponding to a negative pressure in the electron s interior ) are taken into account , at least in some slow - rotation approximation .",
    "this model , too , has been discussed in the literature before  @xcite .",
    "here it is interesting to see that due to those stresses significantly higher values of @xmath3 are possible , though not for small charges as we will also show .",
    "finally we discuss the restriction imposed by the condition of energy dominance , which basically says that the speed of sound of the stress - supporting material should not exceed the speed of light .",
    "this sets an upper bound on @xmath3 given by @xmath98 .",
    "note that all these statements are made only in the realm where the slow - rotation approximation is valid .",
    "i do not know of any fully special - relativistic treatment on which generalisations of these statements could be based . in that sense ,",
    "the general answer to our main question posed above is still lacking .",
    "consider a homogeneous charge distribution , @xmath99 , of total charge @xmath100 on a sphere of radius @xmath101 centred at the origin ( again we write @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) : @xmath102 for the moment we shall neglect the rest mass of the matter that sits at @xmath103 and also the stresses it must support in order to keep the charge distribution in place .",
    "the charge is the source of the scalar potential @xmath104 with corresponding electric field @xmath105 let now the charge distribution rotate rigidly with constant angular velocity @xmath106 .",
    "this gives rise to a current density @xmath107 which , in turn , is the source of a vector potential according to @xmath108 hence , in the rotating case , there is an additional magnetic field in addition to the electric field  ( [ eq : electricfield ] ) : @xmath109 where @xmath110 for @xmath111 this is a constant field in @xmath106 direction .",
    "for @xmath112 it is a pure dipole field ( i.e. all higher multipole components vanish ) with moment ( [ eq : magndipolemoment ] ) .",
    "the general expression for the energy of the electromagnetic field is etc . ]",
    "@xmath113 for the case at hand , the electric and magnetic contributions to the energy are respectively given by    [ eq : electric - magneticfieldenergy ] @xmath114    the total magnetic contribution can be written as @xmath115 where @xmath116 may be called the _ electromagnetic moment of inertia _",
    "it has no mechanical interpretation in terms of a rigid rotation of the electrostatic energy distribution ( see below )",
    "!    the total electromagnetic energy can now be written as @xmath117 where we used @xmath17 and set @xmath118 . the ratio of magnetic ( ` kinetic ' ) to total energy is then given by @xmath119 which is a strictly monotonic function of @xmath120 bounded above by 1 ( as it should be ) . however ,",
    "if we require @xmath121 , the upper bound is @xmath122 .",
    "the momentum density of the electromagnetic field vanishes for @xmath111 and is given by @xmath123 for @xmath112 ( @xmath124 times ` poynting vector ' ) .",
    "the angular - momentum density also vanishes for @xmath111 .",
    "for @xmath112 it is given by @xmath125 hence the total linear momentum vanishes , whereas the total angular momentum is given by @xmath126 with the _ same _ @xmath127 ( moment of inertia ) as in ( [ eq : emmomentinertia ] ) .",
    "the gyromagnetic ratio now follows from expressions ( [ eq : magndipolemoment ] ) for @xmath22 and ( [ eq : totalangularmomentummod1 ] ) for @xmath25 : @xmath128 where @xmath129 denotes the total mass , which is here given by @xmath130 hence @xmath3 can be solved for : @xmath131 so that @xmath132 even with that simple model we do get quite close to @xmath4 .",
    "it is sometimes stated that abraham s model somehow ` predicts ' @xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite p.39 or @xcite p.206 ) , though this is not at all obvious from @xcite .",
    "my interpretation for how such a ` prediction ' could come about can be given in terms of the present special - relativistic model .. ] it rests on an ( inconsistent ) combination of the following two observations . first , if we lorentz transform the purely electric field ( [ eq : electricfield ] ) into constant translational motion with velocity @xmath133 , we obtain a new electric and also a non - vanishing magnetic field .",
    "the integrated poynting vector then gives the total electromagnetic momentum of the charged shell at speed @xmath133 : @xmath134 where @xmath135 the infamous factor 4/3 results from the contribution of the ( unbalanced ) electromagnetic stresses . generally speaking , the factor 4/3 marks the discrepancy between two definitions of ` electromagnetic mass ' , one through the electromagnetic momentum , the other , called @xmath136 above , through the electrostatic energy .",
    "this discrepancy is nothing to get terribly excited about and simply a consequence of the non - conservation of the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor , i.e. , @xmath137 , a result of which is that the ( unbalanced ) electromagnetic stresses contribute to the electromagnetic momentum another third of the expression @xmath138 that one naively obtains from just formally transforming total energy and momentum as time and space components respectively of a four vector .",
    "much discussion in the literature was provoked by getting confused whether this state of affairs had anything to do with lorentz non - covariance .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for a good account and references . ] in this way one is led to assign to the electron a dynamically measurable rest - mass of @xmath139 _ if one neglects the rotational energy_. second , we may ask how fast the electron is to spin for ( [ eq : total mass ] ) to just give @xmath139 ( rest energy of the spinning electron ) .",
    "the immediate answer is , that this is just the case if and only if @xmath140 , which in view of ( [ eq : em - gfactor ] ) is equivalent to @xmath4 .",
    "it is now obvious how this argument rests on the conflation of two different notions of mass .",
    "the factor @xmath141 will consistently be dealt with by taking into account the stresses that balance electrostatic repulsion , not by trying to account for it in letting the electron spin fast enough .      in the introduction",
    "we stressed that the emancipation of the notion of angular momentum from the usual kinematical notion of rotation in space had already begun in classical field theory .",
    "more precisely this applies to maxwell s theory , in which the notion of a field differs from that of , say , hydrodynamics in that it is _ not _ thought of as being attached to a material carrier .",
    "this has consequences if we wish to apply kinematical states of motion to the field itself .    at first sight ,",
    "faraday s picture of lines of force in space suggests to view them as material entities , capable of assuming different kinematical states of motion .",
    "if so , the time - dependence of the electromagnetic field might then be interpreted as , and possibly explained by , the motions of such lines ( given by some yet unknown equations of motion , of which the maxwell equations might turn out to be some coarse grained version ) . that this is not possible",

    "more precisely , we will need to invoke the integral of @xmath184 ( the dot ( @xmath185 ) refers to the inner product with respect to the minkowski metric ) over the sphere @xmath103 : @xmath186 where we used @xmath187 and @xmath188 from ( [ eq : minkmetric ] ) .",
    "the addition of the stress part has the effect that the total energy - momentum tensor is now conserved ( here in the slow - rotation approximation ) : @xmath189 as one may explicitly check .",

    "this clearly equals @xmath199 since , according to maxwell s equations , this quantity equals minus the electromagnetic force density on the charge distribution , which is obviously @xmath200 .",
    "in fact , this is precisely the interpretation that we used to determine @xmath198 in the first place .",
    "the conservation equation ( [ eq : em - conservation ] ) generally ensures that total energy and total momentum form , respectively , the time- and space component of a four vector .",
    "let us now show explicitly that @xmath201 removes the factor @xmath141 in the calculation of the linear momentum when the system is boosted in , say , the @xmath202 direction . to do this we need to calculate the integral of @xmath203 over all of space and",

    "this was achieved by including stresses , which subtracted one third of the electromagnetic linear momentum . to be such that the total energy and momentum derived from @xmath209 should transform as a four vector clearly still leaves much freedom in the choice of @xmath210 .",
    "the choice made here is such that the total rest energy equals the electrostatic self energy .",
    "but other values for the rest energy ( like , e.g. , 4/3 of the electrostatic contribution ) would also have been possible .",
    "in particular , the ` covariantisation through stresses ' does not as such prefer any of the ` electromagnetic masses ' mentioned above ( footnote[foot : fourthirds ] ) , as has also been demonstrated in an elegant and manifestly covariant fashion in @xcite . ] similarly , the stresses will also subtract from the electromagnetic angular momentum , this time even the larger portion of three quarters of it .",
    "moreover , since the magnetic moment is the same as before , the stresses will have the tendency to increase the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "this we will see next in more detail      the total angular momentum represented by ( [ eq : fullem - tensor ] ) is calculated by the general formula    [ eq : angmom2mod ] @xmath211 the matter part , @xmath212 , corresponding to ( [ eq : fullem - tensor - b ] ) , yields the standard expression for a mass - shell of uniform density : @xmath213 the electromagnetic part is the same as that already calculated , since the electromagnetic field is the same .",
    "therefore we just read off ( [ eq : totalangularmomentummod1 ] ) and ( [ eq : emmomentinertia ] ) that @xmath214 finally , using ( [ eq : intp ] ) , the contribution of the stresses can also be written down : @xmath215 adding the last two contributions shows that the inclusion of stresses amounts to reducing the electromagnetic contribution from the value given by ( [ eq : angmom2mod - b ] ) to a quarter of that value : @xmath216 in total we have @xmath217    to linear order in @xmath151 the kinetic energy does not contribute to the overall mass , @xmath129 , which is therefore simply given by the sum of the bare and the electrostatic mass @xmath218 using this to eliminate @xmath136 in ( [ eq : totangmom2mod-1 ] ) gives @xmath219      since the electromagnetic field is exactly as in the previous model , the magnetic moment in the present case is that given by ( [ eq : magndipolemoment ] ) .",

    "the interval ( [ eq : rangeg - fac2mod ] ) looks striking , given the modern experimental values for the electron and the proton : @xmath227",

    "it is of particular interest to us since it allows to easily express the slow - rotation assumption @xmath235 .",

    "hence we write @xmath238 then , using that the fine - structure constant in si units reads @xmath239 , we get @xmath240 this nicely shows that the slow - rotation approximation constrains the given combination of angular momentum , charge , and gyromagnetic factor .",
    "in particular , any gyromagnetic factor up to @xmath225 can be so obtained , given that the charge is sufficiently large . if we set @xmath4 and @xmath241 ( corresponding to the electron s values ) , we get @xmath242 this means that indeed we can not cover the electrons values with the present model while keeping the slow - rotation approximation , though this model seems to be able to accommodate values of @xmath3 up to six if the charge is sufficiently high .",
    "however , we did not check whether the assumption that the matter of the shell provided the stabilising stresses is in any way violating general conditions to be imposed on any energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this we shall do next .",
    "energy dominance essentially requires the velocity of sound in the stress - supporting material to be superluminal .",
    "it is conceivable that for certain values of the physical quantities @xmath243 the stresses would become unphysically high . to check that , at least for the condition of energy dominance , we first note from ( [ eq : fullem - tensor - c ] ) and ( [ eq : elmass ] ) that the stress part of the energy - momentum tensor can be written in the form @xmath244 hence the ratio between the stress within the shell ( in any direction given by the unit spacelike vector @xmath53 tangent to the shell , so that @xmath245 ) and its energy density , as measured by a locally co - rotating observer , is given by @xmath246 where we used ( [ eq : functparaobs - a ] ) and ( [ eq : functparaobs - b ] ) in the last step .",
    "the condition of energy dominance now requires this quantity to be bounded above by 1 , so that @xmath247 interestingly this depends on @xmath3 only .",
    "hence we get , after all , an upper bound for @xmath3 , though from the condition of energy dominance , i.e. a subluminal speed of sound in the shell material , and not from the condition of a subluminal rotational speed .",
    "what is the size of the electron ? according to ( [ eq : functparaobs - c ] ) , its radius comes out to be @xmath248 where we set @xmath249 and @xmath4 . on the other hand , in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the compton wavelength of the electron is @xmath250 so that their quotient is just @xmath251 this might first look as if the classical electron is really small , at least compared to its compton wavelength .",
    "however , in absolute terms we have ( @xmath252 stands for the length scale `` fermi '' ) @xmath253 which is very large compared to the scale of @xmath254 at which modern high - energy experiments have probed the electron s structure , so far without any indication for substructures . at that scale",
    "the model discussed here is certainly not capable of producing any reasonable values for the electron parameters , since the electrostatic mass ( and hence the total mass , if we assume the weak energy - condition , @xmath255 , for the shell matter ) comes out much too large and the angular momentum much too small ( assuming @xmath121 ) .",
    "one might ask whether the inclusion of gravity will substantially change the situation . for example",
    ", one would expect the gravitational binding to reduce the electrostatic self - energy .",
    "an obvious and answerable questions is whether the electron could be a black hole ?",
    "what is particularly intriguing about spinning and charged black holes in general relativity is that their gyromagnetic factor is @xmath4 , always and exactly !",
    "is already a preferred value in special - relativistic electrodynamics  @xcite , a fact on which modern precision measurements of @xmath256 rest .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for instructive discussions as to what makes @xmath4 also a special value in general relativity . ] for a mass @xmath230 of about @xmath257 to be a black hole it must be confined to a region smaller than the schwarzschild radius @xmath258 , which is almost 40 orders of magnitude below the scale to which the electron structure has been probed and found featureless . hence , leaving alone quantum theory , it is certainly a vast speculation to presumes the electron to be a black hole . but",
    "would it also be inconsistent from the point of view of general relativity ?",
    "the kerr - newman family of solutions for the einstein - maxwell equations allow any parameter values for mass ( except that it must be positive ) , charge , and angular momentum . as already stated , @xmath4 automatically .",

    "classically one would reject the solution for the reason of having a naked singularity .",
    "but note that this does not exclude the possibility that this exterior solution is valid up to some finite radius , and is then continued by another solution that takes into account matter sources other than just the electromagnetic field . means a very small angular momentum indeed .",
    "recall that in newtonian approximation the angular momentum of a homogeneous massive ball of radius @xmath101 is @xmath270 , so that @xmath271 translates to the following inequality for the spin period @xmath272 : @xmath273}{m[\\mathrm{kg}]}\\cdot 10^{19}\\ , \\mathrm{sec}\\,,\\ ] ] which for a ball of radius one meter and mass @xmath274 kilogrammes sets an upper bound for @xmath275 of @xmath276 ! in fact , ( [ eq : macrbodiesam - ratio ] ) is violated by all planets in our solar system . ]",
    "understanding the generation of new ideas and the mechanisms that led to their acceptance is a common central concern of historians of science , philosophers of science , and the working scientists themselves .",
    "the latter might even foster the hope that important lessons can be learnt for the future .",
    "in any case , it seems to me that from all perspectives it is equally natural to ask whether a specific argument is actually true or just put forward for persuasive reasons .    within the history of quantum mechanics the history of spin",
    "is , in my opinion , of particular interest , since it marks the first instance where a genuine quantum degree of freedom without a classically corresponding one were postulated to exist . if this were the general situation , our understanding of a quantum theory as the quantisation of a classical theory can not be fundamentally correct",
    ". on the other hand , modern theories of quantisation can explain the quantum theory of a spinning particle as the result of a quantisation applied to some classical theory , in which the notion of spin is already present .",
    "hence , from a modern perspective , it is simply not true that spin has no classical counterpart .",
    "that verdict ( that is has no classical counterpart ) , which is still often heard and/or read , is based on a narrow concept of ` classical system ' , which has been overcome in modern formulations , as was already mentioned in footnote[foot : classicalspin ] to which i refer at this point . from that point of view , spin is no less natural in classical physics than in quantum theory , which has now become the standard attitude in good textbooks on analytical mechanics , e.g. @xcite@xcite as well as in attempts to formulate theories of quantisation  @xcite@xcite .    in the present contribution i concentrated on another aspect , namely whether it is actually true that classical models for the electron ( as they were already , or could have been , established around 1925 ) are not capable to account for the actual values of the four electron parameters : mass , charge , angular momentum , and the gyromagnetic factor .",
    "this criticism was put forward from the very beginning ( lorentz ) and was often repeated thereafter .",
    "it turns out that this argument is not as clear cut as usually implied .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 is by no means incompatible with classical physics .",
    "unfortunately , explicit calculations seem to have been carried out only in a simplifying slow - rotation approximation , in which the poincar stresses may be taken uniform over the charged shell . in the regime of validity of this approximation",
    "@xmath4 is attainable , but not for small charges .",
    "i do not think it is known whether and , if so , how an exact treatment improves on the situation . in that sense , the answer to the question posed above is not known .",
    "an exact treatment would have to account for the centrifugal forces that act on the rotating shell in a latitude dependent way . as a result ,",
    "the poincar stresses can not retain the simple ( constant ) form as in ( [ eq : fullem - tensor - c ] ) but must now also be latitude dependent . in particular , they must be equal in sign but larger in magnitude than given in ( [ eq : surfacestress ] ) since now they need in addition to balance the outward pushing centrifugal forces .",
    "on one hand , this suggests that their effect is a still further reduction of angular momentum for fixed magnetic moment , resulting in still larger values for @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "fast rotational velocities result in an increase of the inertial mass according to ( [ eq : massveldep ] ) and hence an increase of angular momentum , though by the same token also an increase in the centrifugal force and hence an increase in stress .",
    "how the account of these different effects finally turns out to be is unclear ( to me ) without a detailed calculation .",
    "it would be of interest to return to this issue in the future .",
