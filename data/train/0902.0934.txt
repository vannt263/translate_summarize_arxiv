    "<S> we study the interaction of dark - bright solitons in two component bose - einstein condensates by suitably tailoring the trap potential , atomic scattering length and atom gain or loss . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the coupled gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation can be mapped onto the manakov model </S>",
    "<S> . an interesting class of matter wave solitons and their interaction are identified with time independent and periodically modulated trap potentials , which can be experimentally realized in two component condensates . </S>",
    "<S> these include periodic collapse and revival of solitons , and snake - like matter wave solitons as well as different kinds of two soliton interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : multi - component bose - einstein condensates , manakov model , solitons    the advent of solitons in ultra cold quantum gases has provided a new insight into the understanding of the localized wave packets that travel over long distances without attenuation . in this context , recent explorations of solitons in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have paved the way for new developments in manipulating coherent matter waves for applications , including atom interferometry , coherent atom transport and quantum information processing or quantum computation . in particular , experimental observations of matter wave solitons of the dark  @xcite , and bright  @xcite types in becs </S>",
    "<S> have attracted a great deal of attention in connection with the dynamics of nonlinear matter waves , including soliton propagation @xcite , vortex dynamics  @xcite , interference patterns  @xcite and domain walls in binary becs  @xcite .    in this connection , recently much effort has been given to the study of matter wave solitons in becs with time varying control parameters such as ( i ) variation of atomic scattering length which can be achieved through feshbach resonance  @xcite , ( ii ) inclusion of appropriate time dependent gain or loss term which can be phenomenologically incorporated to account for the interaction of atomic cloud or thermal cloud , and ( iii ) periodic modulation of trap frequencies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bright solitons created in the experiments are themselves condensates and propagated over much larger distances than dark solitons which , on the other hand , can only exist as notches or holes within the condensates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , dark solitons , their oscillations and interaction have been demonstrated in experiments with single component becs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many studies on the bright / dark soliton formation and propagation of attractive / repulsive becs have been focussed mainly on the single species systems .    </S>",
    "<S> multi - component generalization of the soliton dynamics is very natural in the context of atomic becs because of the several ways to create such systems , for example as mixtures with two different atomic species / hyperfine states  @xcite , and as internal degrees of freedom liberated under an optical trap and atom - molecule becs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the multicomponent becs , far from being a trivial extension of the single component ones , present novel and fundamentally different scenarios for their ground states and excitations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> matter wave solitons in multicomponent becs hold promise for a number of applications , including the multi - channel signals and their switching , coherent storage and processing of optical fields .    since multi - component becs are of greater interest for the aforesaid reasons , in this letter we investigate the interaction of dark and bright solitons in two component becs . </S>",
    "<S> in the context of cold atomic gases , the two vector components which evolve under the gross - pitaevskii equation are the macroscopic wave functions of bose condensed atoms in two different internal states , which we shall denote as @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> if one considers condensates of , for instance , @xmath2na and @xmath3rb atoms , the nonlinear interactions are due to elastic s - wave scattering among the atoms , and are effectively repulsive ( positive scattering length ) for both the systems in which multi - component condensates have been realized  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , there has been a tremendous interest in studying the dynamics of two - component bose - einstein condensates coupled to the environment using both experimental and theoretical means  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we bring out exact bright - dark solitons in repulsively interacting two - component becs coupled with the thermal clouds , which introduce gain / loss of condensate atoms . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , by considering both time independent and periodically modulated trap potentials , we show fascinating interactions of matter wave solitons .    for the above purpose , we consider a trapped bec with two components , where the dynamics takes place only in one dimension due to the strong trap confinement in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> we have also included the interaction of external thermal clouds which is described by gain or loss term . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of becs that are prepared in two hyperfine states can be described at sufficiently low temperatures by the dimensionless form of two coupled gp equations as  @xcite @xmath4 \\psi_{j } , \\;\\;j = 1,2 . </S>",

    "<S> here we have considered the case of a two - component condensate with @xmath3rb atoms prepared in two different hyperfine states for which the atomic masses , intra- and inter - component atomic scattering lengths are equal as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that in equation ( [ cgpe ] ) , the variable @xmath19 actually represents @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , and similarly @xmath22 stands for @xmath23 .    in equation  ( [ cgpe ] ) </S>",
    "<S> when the gain / loss term @xmath24 is positive , it leads to the mechanism of loading external atoms ( thermal clouds ) into the bec by optical pumping while @xmath25 describes a bec that is continuously depleted ( loss ) of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> if the condensate is fed by a surrounding thermal cloud , then the condensate undergoes an appropriate growth / collapse . in actual bec experiments , for example , with @xmath26li and @xmath27rb atoms , </S>",
    "<S> the atomic scattering length can be varied by suitably tuning the external magnetic field through the feshbach resonance as  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is scattering length of condensed atoms , @xmath30 is the external time varying magnetic field , @xmath31 is the resonance magnetic field and @xmath32 is the resonance width . </S>",
    "<S> similar tuning of scattering length should be possible for two component condensates as well , for example in the case of hyperfine states of @xmath3rb .    using the following point transformation  @xcite @xmath33 equation ( [ cgpe ] ) </S>",

    "<S> equation ( [ 2cnls ] ) is the so called defocussing manakov system , which exhibits interesting one , two and @xmath46-soliton solutions of bright - bright , dark - dark and dark - bright types  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> concentrating for the present only on dark - bright solitons , from the solutions of equation ( [ 2cnls ] ) , one can straightforwardly construct the one , two and @xmath46 dark - bright soliton solutions for equation ( [ cgpe ] ) , provided @xmath47 , @xmath24 and @xmath43 satisfy equation ( [ riccati ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we may note here that because of the complicated transformation involved above , the resultant soliton parameters are no longer constants but are functions of @xmath19 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the resultant soliton solutions may be considered as generalized solitons and not simple standard solitons .    </S>",
