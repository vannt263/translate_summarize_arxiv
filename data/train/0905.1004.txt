    "decoherence and entanglement constitute the last frontiers of quantum mechanics . the crucial role of decoherence in the quantum - classical transition , was gradually revealed over the past three decades @xcite .",
    "according to this environmentally induced superselection scenario @xcite , the environment interactions with an open quantum system , select a preferred basis set of so called pointer states that are immune to decoherence .",
    "pointer states define realizable observables , thereby restricting the number of meaningful measurements to a handful of classical quantities . for a multipartite system ,",
    "all correlations but those existing in the pointer states , are rapidly destroyed by decoherence , so that out of all possible decompositions of the mixed multipartite state into a statistical mixture of pure states , only the decomposition into pointer states is resilient . hence , after a short time from its onset , decoherence drives the system into an incoherent sum of eigenstates of _ particular _ classical observables .    the notion of classicality is fundamental to the theory of quantum bose gases @xcite . in fact",
    ", the very definition of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is the emergence of single - particle coherence @xcite , which enables the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) classical field description of the interacting many - particle bec state , @xmath3 in the above , @xmath4 is the classical condensate order parameter , @xmath5 is particle s mass , @xmath6 is an external potential ( e.  g.  an harmonic trap ) , and @xmath7 is the two body interaction strength ( set by low - energy @xmath8-wave scattering with characteristic scattering length @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus , somewhat ironically , the epitomization of quantum mechanics on a mesoscopic scale , is in fact a classical , uncorrelated state .    at zero temperature ,",
    "the magnitude of quantum fluctuations around the condensate state , scales down as @xmath10 , with increasing particle number @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath0 in dilute bec experiments is in the range of @xmath11 particles , quantum fluctuations are characteristically small and the classical field description is an excellent approximation .",
    "however , the initially small value of quantum fluctuations does not necessarily guarantee that they will remain small away from equilibrium .",
    "in particular , if the classical dynamics is unstable , fluctuations grow rapidly and become significant on timescales that only grow logarithmically with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "single - particle coherence is thus dynamically lost due to interparticle entanglement caused by the interactions , at a rate which depends on the stability of the classical dynamics . for large @xmath0 ,",
    "the early stages of this process may be viewed as the decoherence of the reduced single particle state due to its coupling to a bath of quantum correlations @xcite . as such",
    ", collisional dephasing will have its own set of pointer states , untouched by the coupling to the environment of quantum correlations .",
    "coupling the many - body system to an external bath ( e.g. at finite temperature , where the bath consists of the thermal - cloud degrees of freedom ) , we are confronted with an interesting situation , where the decoherence of the system due to its entanglement with the bath , may affect the loss of single - particle coherence due to the internal entanglement of different particles , thereby affecting its classicality . in previous work we found that local site noise enhances the collisional loss of single - particle coherence in a two mode bec , also known as _ phase - diffusion _ @xcite .",
    "hence such noise drives the system away from classical behavior .",
    "here we provide the details of recent work @xcite showing that decoherence can also _ suppress _ the loss of single - particle coherence in the interacting two - mode system .",
    "since inelastic collisions measure the relative number between the modes , the pointer states of collisional dephasing are relative - number ( fock ) states . starting from an antisymmetric coherent state in the absence of an external bath",
    ", it dephases in a rate which depends on the coupling parameter @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the hopping energy between the modes @xcite . subjecting the same state to different forms of decoherence",
    ", we find that when the pointer states of the external bath coincide with the relative number states , dephasing is enhanced . on the other hand ,",
    "when the pointer states have a definite number between the odd- and even superpositions of the two modes , so as to include the initial state , dephasing is slowed down .",
    "since the amplification of quantum noise is sensitive to the relative phase between the odd- and even superpositions of the modes , the suppression of single - particle dephasing can be viewed as a quantum zeno effect ( qze ) @xcite , resulting from the continuous projection onto relative number states which prevents this phase from taking a definite value . the predicted suppression of phase - diffusion is shown to depend on the number of particles as @xmath2 in the @xmath14 josephson regime and as @xmath1 in the @xmath15 fock regime , making the qze dramatically more pronounced for high @xmath0 .",
    "we note that another example of increased coherence due to the combined effects of lossy dissipation and interactions , has been found in the bimodal bec system in the form of a stochastic resonance @xcite .",

    "ii and collisional dephasing is discussed in sec .",
    "iii , demonstrating different qualitative behavior in three distinct coupling regimes . in sec .",

    "starting out as a bare - bones toy model @xcite , which retains many of the qualitative features of the many - mode bose - hubbard model @xcite , the two - mode bec was recently shown to be useful in the description of quantum interference experiments @xcite , bosonic josephson junctions @xcite and quantum tunneling in an array of separated double wells @xcite .",

    "this site - indiscriminate noise may be implemented e.g. by a stochastic modulation of the potential barrier between the sites . since the odd quasi - momentum mode has a node between the sites whereas the even quasi - momentum mode does",
