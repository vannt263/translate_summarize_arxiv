    "traditionally , s0 galaxies were thought to represent a transition between elliptical ( e ) and spiral ( s ) galaxies .",
    "they share with the latter a central bulge and an exponential disc , and with the former the lack of spiral structure or arms . they are considered inert objects with very little gas , composed almost exclusively of population ii type stars , and virtually a total absence of on  going star formation .",
    "this picture has changed considerably over the past 20 years thanks mainly to tremendous progress in observational techniques which are now routinely delivering high sensitivity data over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "the interstellar medium of early  type galaxies , and especially that of s0s , has attracted a great deal of interest ever since @xcite showed that a considerable amount of mass ejected by evolved stars could pile up over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "surprisingly , though , high resolution , sensitive observations demonstrated that in general hardly any gas is detected and that most of it seems to have been accreted ( @xcite ) . the scarcity of material detected in , h@xmath17 , co , and at fir wavelengths and the origin of that material form two puzzles of contemporary astronomy .",
    "@xcite discuss several ways in which gas could have been expelled or eliminated from early  type systems .",
    "they reach the conclusion that gas is particularly hard to remove from these systems via star formation .",
    "although star formation has virtually ceased , there are indications that some star formation is taking place in s0s , as based on iras observations ( @xcite ) and co observations ( @xcite ) which show that some s0s rival spirals in their co content , but that the molecular gas is concentrated within 12 kpc from the centre .",
    "we have started a project , mapping a few early  type galaxies in detail , in order to shed light on the origin of the ism in these objects . in this paper",
    "we present the results obtained for one of the galaxies under study , ngc404 .",
    "ngc404 is a typical example of an early  type galaxy which shows more activity than expected from such systems .",
    "it contains an appreciable amount of atomic @xcite and molecular gas @xcite , a prominent , semicircular dust lane encircling the nucleus @xcite and various bright uv point sources @xcite .",
    "it was classified a liner by @xcite .",
    "@xcite classified this galaxy as e@xmath18 , because of the dust lane .",
    "@xcite and @xcite classified it as an s0@xmath19 . based on photographic surface photometry , @xcite show that the object consists of bulge , lens , and exponential disc components , characteristic of a lenticular galaxy .",
    "this easily rules out a classification as ( dwarf ) elliptical , as several authors have proposed .",
    "for many years the distance to ngc  404 was basically an unknown quantity .",
    "estimates ranged from 1.5mpc @xcite to 10mpc @xcite .",
    "it is only recently that a firm distance to this object has been established .",
    "@xcite used the surface brightness fluctuation method to come up with a distance of 3.3 mpc .",
    "this was confirmed independently by @xcite who used the tip of the red giant branch and determined a distance of @xmath20mpc .",
    "although ngc  404 is listed as a member of the loose group lgg  011 @xcite , it is unlikely to be physically associated with the rest of the group as at 3.3  mpc @xcite the nearest member , ngc  598 ( m33 ) , is located at 2.6 mpc .",
    "rather , ngc  404 is likely the nearest isolated s0 galaxy , especially as there are no other known galaxies within 1.1  mpc of it @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the field is only two degrees away from the centre of the piscis cluster of galaxies ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "a summary of optical data on ngc  404 is given in table  [ optical - datos ] .",
    "ngc404 was observed with the nrao very large array ( vla ) on 1996 april 1 ( c  array ) and 1996 july 16 ( d  array ) in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen ( ) . in c  array ( with baselines between 100 and 3000 m , or 0.5 to 15 k@xmath22 ) the object was observed for 132 minutes ; in d  array ( with baselines between 20 and 1000 m or 0.1 to 5 k@xmath22 ) it was observed for 54 minutes . the absolute flux calibration was determined by observing 3c48 , which was assigned a flux density of 15.99 jy .",
    "this calibrator was also used to derive the complex bandpass correction . a nearby calibrator ( 0116 + 319 )",
    "was used as secondary amplitude and phase calibrator , and its flux was determined to be @xmath23 jy .",
    "details about the observations can be found in table  [ vla - datos ] .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated separately for each array with the aips package using standard reduction techniques .",
    "the systemic velocity of ngc  404 is @xmath24 at a galactic latitude of @xmath25 , hence some of the channels were confused with galactic emission ( in particular between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "since galactic emission shows its presence on predominantly large scales , we were able to remove the most prominent emission features by blanking the _ uv _ data out to @xmath28 in these channels ( this affects only d  array ) .",
    "the _ uv _ data were examined and bad data points caused by either interference or cross talk between antennae were removed , after which the data were calibrated .",
    "we fourier  transformed our c and d  configuration observations separately to assess their quality . finally , we combined both data cubes to form a single dataset which was used for further analysis .",
    "the original bandwidth of the data was 1.56mhz ; for the rest of this paper we use a 0.69mhz wide bandwidth around the spectral region of interest .",
    "the data have a velocity resolution , after on  line hanning smoothing , of 12.2  khz ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "channels with velocities higher than @xmath30 and lower than @xmath31 were determined to be line ",
    "a total of 20 channels on either side of the main profile containing no line emission were averaged to form a  dirty \" continuum image , again avoiding the edge channels of the bandpass .",
    "the average continuum level was subtracted from the _ uv _ data .",
    "high ( @xmath32 ) resolution cubes were obtained using the task imagr with the parameter _ robust_=1 ( where _ robust_=5 corresponds to uniform weighting and _ robust_= 5 to natural weighting ) . with this value",
    "we obtain the best compromise between the smallest beam ( almost identical to ` uniform ' ) and the lowest noise ( almost identical to ` natural ' ) .",
    "cleaning was applied down to a flux level of 2 times the average rms noise in the maps and in an area large enough to include all the prominent emission . fig .",

    "the resulting high resolution cubes ( @xmath35 pixels @xmath36 channels at @xmath34 ) were smoothed to a spatial resolution of @xmath37 ( hpbw ) in order to bring out the faint , extended structures ( referred to henceforth as low resolution cubes ) .",
    "table  [ vla - result ] lists the characteristics of the resulting data cubes .",
    "the global profile was obtained by integration over the individual high resolution channel maps ( note that this can be safely done as all continuum emission was subtracted in the _ uv _ plane ) . before the summation ,",
    "the flux at each position was corrected for attenuation by the primary beam of the array .",
    "the resulting global profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ cuernos ] . from the global profile",
    "we derive a total flux of @xmath38 , a systemic velocity of @xmath39 and a global velocity profile width at 20% and 50% of the maximum of 85 and 65 @xmath33 ( not corrected for inclination , instrumental resolution , turbulent or @xmath40 direction gas motion ; the error is of order one channel width or @xmath41 ) .    in order to derive the correct flux in each of the channel maps , one has to keep in mind that the determination of fluxes of extended emission in interferometric maps is not straightforward .",
    "as explained by @xcite , fully cleaned maps do not exist , and any cleaned map consists of the sum of two maps : one containing the restored clean components and the other , the residual map . in the former , the unit is jansky per clean beam area , and in the latter jansky per dirty beam area .",
    "following @xcite , we used our cleaned data cube of ngc  404 in order to calculate the real flux of our channels .",
    "we calculate this real flux ( _ g _ ) using _",

    "the reader is referred to the appendix in @xcite .",
    "we followed this procedure for a selected sample of channels , and compared the results with our estimates for the real flux which were obtained by a direct , deep clean .",
    "the agreement is to within a few percent , indicating that using our cleaned maps we get values which are very close to the real flux .",
    "our integrated flux is in fair agreement with that estimated by @xcite using the effelsberg 100m telescope who arrived at a value of @xmath44 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the latter value was reported as being highly uncertain due to contamination of the single dish spectra by foreground emission from the galaxy and could be off by up to 25% .    using  : @xmath45 = 2.356\\times10 ^ 5 \\times d^2\\ , [ { \\rm mpc } ] \\times \\int f_i\\,{\\rm d}v\\,\\rm [ jy\\,km\\,s^{-1}]\\ ] ] we find a total mass of @xmath46 , which is an order of magnitude less than the mean mass found by ( * ? ? ?",

    "the mass  to  blue luminosity ratio , @xmath49 , which is independent of distance , on the other hand is high for an s0 galaxy , and much closer to that found for later type spirals @xcite .",
    "a quick calculation shows that ngc  404 is underluminous for an s0 galaxy , as indicated by the tully  fisher ( 1977 ) relation for this object . correcting the global profile measured at the 20% level for instrumental broadening and for turbulent and @xmath40 direction motions by @xmath50 ( following @xcite ) and assuming an inclination of @xmath51 ( the value that we have found for the inner part of the disc ) we estimate a peak to peak velocity for gas in the disc of @xmath52 or a circular velocity of @xmath53 . the required @xmath54 luminosity in order to have ngc  404 fall on the tully  fisher curve is more than an order of magnitude higher ( 2.5 to 3 magnitudes ) than the value we assumed here and would imply a distance of order 20 mpc which is completely ruled out by the distance determination of 3.3 mpc by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "after fourier transforming the _ uv_data the resulting data cube was conditionally blanked , accepting as genuine all emission at levels above @xmath55 rms noise in the data cube smoothed to a resolution of @xmath56 , and requiring that the emission is seen in at least 3 consecutive channels .",
    "maps of the column density distribution and velocity field were obtained by taking the zeroth and first moment of the spectra at each pixel along the velocity axis .",

    "the ellipticity of that ring is higher than that of the disc , suggesting a different inclination .",
    "our vla data imply a mass of @xmath59 in the `` galaxy '' ( r@xmath60 ) and @xmath61 in the `` annulus '' ( r@xmath62 ) , that is , roughly a distribution of 3/4 of the total mass in the galaxy and 1/4 in the outer ring .",

    "the projected radial velocities range from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "the velocities of the outer ring fall within the same range as those of the main body , but the position angle shows a jump ( see fig .  [ three - fits ] ) .",
    "the velocity field in the inner region ( @xmath77 ) is sufficiently regular to permit the determination of a rotation curve for which we used a tilted  ring model as implemented by the task rotcur in the gipsy package @xcite .",

    "points on either side of the major axis are included up to @xmath83 ( i.e. we excluded a sector around the minor axis ) . using best guesses for the systemic velocity ( @xmath81 ) and the kinematical centre of the object , fitted values for @xmath72 , pa and an approximate rotation curve were calculated . once fits for @xmath72 and pa as a function of radius were found , these values were held fixed and @xmath81 and the central position were fitted .",

    "we then proceeded to minimize the dispersion of @xmath90 and pa for each ring .",
    "it should be noted that the solution for @xmath79 and @xmath72 are coupled through the factor @xmath91 in eq .",
    "[ vel - rot ] , and that this coupling is very strong for low inclinations . in the case of ngc404 we decided to adopt an inclination of @xmath92 near a radius of @xmath93 , close to the location of the peak of the observed rotation curve .",

    "not being able to independently fit @xmath79 and @xmath72 , we instead considered two extreme solutions .",

    "this model is inspired by the observed radial velocity as a function of radius which follows in its outer parts an r@xmath97 curve .",
    "fits to the receding and approaching side of an r@xmath97 decline agree to within @xmath98 .",
    "we followed @xcite and constructed a keplerian rotation curve , based on the sum of an inhomogeneous spheroid and a toomre disc with @xmath99 , scaled to match the peak velocity of our data .",
    "the second solution we adopted was for the rotation curve to remain flat ( model f ) after reaching a peak rotational velocity of @xmath94 at a radius of @xmath93 .",
    "with the rotational velocity thus fixed , we reran rotcur and for each model we left only as free parameters to be fitted the pa and @xmath72 .",

    "the values for the receding and approaching sides , as well as the average over both sides is plotted .",
    "the first thing we note is that for both models the position angles share practically the same values , indicating that this parameter is insensitive to either choice of rotation curve and probably reflects the true run of position angle with radius .",
    "the two first points ( r@xmath100 ) are not significant as they fall within the hole ( see fig .  [ both ] ) , where there is scant gas and the fit can take almost any value . from r@xmath101 to r@xmath102 the value for the pa declines monotonically and almost linearly from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",

    "there is a discontinuity at r@xmath103 ( close to @xmath104 ) .",
    "it is exactly around this radius that we reach the edge of the main body of the galaxy and that we see the transition to the annulus .",
    "finally , the annulus shows the same tendency , but less pronounced by a factor of 2 , the pa decreasing from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the behaviour of pa being so similar in both models , the most significant differences then have to be a function of @xmath72 , and mainly for r@xmath105 , where the functional behaviour of both rotation curves starts to diverge .",
    "this is indeed what we find . within the errors ,",
    "the inclination for the doughnut is constant , differences as small as @xmath106 being sufficient to mask the difference between the k and f models .",
    "beyond r@xmath107 the inclination in the case of the k model has to increase whereas in the case of the f model it remains roughly constant .",
    "[ 2warp ] is an attempt to visualize the shape and extent of the implied warp , both for a keplerian decline as well as for a flat rotation curve .",
    "we can now proceed to derive the mass within the last measured point for both the k and f model fits to the velocity field . in the case of a keplerian decline and assuming for simplicity a spherical mass model : @xmath108 , ( @xmath109 in @xmath110 , @xmath111 in @xmath33 and @xmath112 in kpc ) , we derive a total mass @xmath113 .",
    "this is assuming the peak rotational velocity of @xmath114 is reached at @xmath115 after which point the rotation curve falls off . in that case the global @xmath116 ratio is @xmath117 .",
    "this is quite a high value and a factor of 1.5 higher than the already substantial values encountered by @xcite .",
    "if we now consider a flat rotation curve , taking as the last measured point a value of @xmath118 , the mass turns out to be four times higher , @xmath119 , and the mass  luminosity ratio would reach a staggering @xmath120 .",
    "although the @xmath121 values are high , ngc  404 can not be considered a massive galaxy . if we take the total mass enclosed within @xmath122 ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) we find @xmath125 , less than 10% of the mean mass encountered within the same radius in the galaxies making up the sample of @xcite .",
    "in that case the mass  to  light ratio is @xmath126 . although this is still high , it is more in line with that found in early type galaxies .",

    "the question about the origin of the gas in galaxies of hubble type s0 hasnt been fully answered yet . for example , gas lost by evolving stars is likely to be retained by these fairly massive systems , offering a possible explanation for the origin of the gas which is encountered .",

    "we will look at the different scenarios to explain the origin ( from internal as well as external sources ) of the detected gas in ngc  404 .",
    "this scenario assumes that lenticular galaxies are former spirals , that consumed efficiently their gas content in the process of star formation @xcite . in that case , the gas",
    " rich s0s could be lenticulars which , although they consumed the gas in the inner region , somehow retained some gas in the outskirts .",
    "this is then the left  over primordial gas from which the galaxy was formed . due to the low density of the gas in the outer regions , it never formed stars there .    like",
    "many s0s , ngc  404 presents a central hole in its distribution giving it the appearance of a doughnut with an inner and outer radius of @xmath144 . this extent is larger than that found in other s0s .",
    "the azimuthally averaged neutral atomic gas surface density , @xmath145 , in this ring is @xmath146 , too low by at least a factor of 5 for a efficient star formation to proceed , and of the same order as that encountered in many gas rich s0 s .",
    "we used kennicutt s criterion @xcite to look in a bit more detail in to the this issue . using the observed one dimensional velocity dispersion of the gas and observed rotation curve , we find that the gas surface density is too low by an order of magnitude for gravitational collapse of the gas to occur .",
    "this implies that this scenario runs into trouble on various fronts .",
    "firstly , the neutral gas surface density is way too low for star formation to take place .",
    "in fact , one would expect not only that a close to critical surface density would be found , but also that the peak gas density is reached at the edge of the stellar counterpart . in fact , we find it farther out , near @xmath147 , i.e. , far from the optical edge of the galaxy which is where the purported sf zone ends . also , within this framework other observed features of the gas , such as the change in position and inclination angles , or the presence and morphology of the outer annulus are difficult to account for .",
    "hence , we consider it improbable that the gas in ngc  404 is mainly left  over primordial gas .",
    "it is well established that the ism is constantly replenished through contributions of evolved stars which inject gas and dust into the ism .",
    "this process is also occurring in s0s and indeed , the amount of gas is nt negligible : @xmath148 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this implies that the majority of s0s should be gas rich and that this is the rule rather than the exception .",
    "as we find the contrary , there must exist a mechanism which rids s0s from this gas .",
    "star formation does nt seem a viable candidate as little sf activity is recorded in s0s .",
    "similarly , a galactic wind seems to be ruled out , as is interaction with , e.g. , an intracluster medium , ngc  404 finding itself isolated .",
    "alternatively , the gas which is lost inherits the velocity dispersion of the stars leading to temperatures which are in the x  ray regime .    for a typical s0 with @xmath149 and a blue luminosity , @xmath54 , of order @xmath150 to @xmath151 we",
    "obtain a reasonable estimate for the time needed ( a few times @xmath150 yr ) to collect the observed amount of gas as a result of mass loss from evolved stars .",
    "however , in the case of ngc  404 , its luminosity is very low ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "this , combined with an mass to blue luminosity ratio which is higher than the majority of s0s studied thusfar ( @xmath153 ) , results in an estimated time scale of order a hubble time .",
    "so despite the fact that theoretically the ism detected in ngc404 could be accounted for by steady mass loss since it formed , there are serious shortcomings to this potential explanation . mass loss by evolved stars would nt answer the question why most of the ism is found beyond @xmath147 either , where star formation is and has been negligible .",
    "moreover , it would be difficult to explain where it got its angular momentum from .",
    "the former scenarios offer unsatisfactory explanations for the origin of in ngc  404 .",
    "they especially fail to explain the fact that the outer ring is tilted .",
    "in fact , this is one of the stronger arguments for postulating an external origin of the gas",
    ".    the content could be the result of the merger of a dwarf irregular galaxy with ngc  404 .",
    "if we assume @xmath154 as a value representative for normal dwarf galaxies ( @xmath155 ; @xcite ) we find that a dwarf with @xmath8 has a large enough gas supply to account for the observed amount of @xmath156 of gas .",
    "assuming @xmath157 @xcite , the total mass of the dwarf , in a single merger , would have been @xmath158 .",
    "the total mass of ngc  404 is , at least , @xmath159 .",
    "the mass of the dwarf then would have been only @xmath160 of that of ngc  404 , and the merger would have had no major dynamical effect on the latter .",
    "in section [ curvarot ] we assumed that the gas could be described as moving in concentric annuli within the potential well of the galaxy .",
    "if left to their own design , such annuli tend to settle in a preferred plane , the plane of the galaxy .",
    "following @xcite we have calculated the time scale ( @xmath161 ) for settling to a preferred plane of two annuli in ngc  404 , one at r=@xmath93 and one at r=@xmath3 , assuming that the donor galaxy left its gas in a plane inclined by about @xmath162 with respect to ngc  404 . for r=@xmath163",
    "yr , whereas for r=@xmath164 yr ( which corresponds to @xmath165 rotational periods ) . as can be appreciated in figs .",
    "[ three - fits ] ( the plots of @xmath72 versus radius ) and [ 2warp ] , the gas in the ring at r=@xmath93 has already settled in the plane of the galaxy . now if we assume that the gas has been accreted during just one interaction , this must have happened at least @xmath166 yr ago .",
    "this time lapse agrees fairly well with that necessary for the ring at r=@xmath3 to settle from an original inclination of @xmath167 to its current value of @xmath168 ( assuming keplerian rotation ) .",
    "these arguments restrict considerably the time elapsed since the interaction .",
    "if it were much smaller than @xmath166 yr , the gas of the inner ring ( the doughnut ) would nt have had time to settle into the plane of the galaxy whereas if it were much larger , the outer ring would have settled within the plane of the disc of ngc404 .",
    "if we assume that the gas currently encountered in ngc  404 was transferred in a fly  by encounter , the culprit must have moved outside of a volume with a radius of 1.1 mpc as there are no objects within 1.1  mpc @xcite .",
    "this would imply a relative velocity for the possible intruder of order @xmath169 , an uncomfortably high value .",
    "this rather argues in favor of a catastrophic merger .    in case",
    "the rotation curve is flat ( model f ) , the dynamical time scale , @xmath161 , is slightly shorter , @xmath170 yr for r@xmath171 and comes out to be @xmath172 yr for r@xmath173 .",
    "numerical simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation within the @xmath174 cold dark matter ( @xmath174cdm ) paradigm and carried out with sufficient resolution ( in mass ) to distinguish dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) predict the existence of numerous low - mass halos .",
    "observations , however , come up with numbers much smaller than predicted .",
    "one of the possible explanations which has been invoked is that these halos are too small to produce star formation , or that their luminosity is so low that this makes them difficult to detect . in those systems where star formation has taken place ,",
    "@xmath121 ratios tend to be high @xcite .",
    "these systems are thought to appear in groups .",
    "in contrast , ngc  404 is an isolated galaxy .",
    "@xcite suggest that this galaxy may represent the final stage of consecutive merging of members of a former group of galaxies . in this case",
    ", it could be the dominant member of a group of small galaxies , some of which , rich in neutral gas , have contributed the material which extends up to almost @xmath175 .",
    "the high @xmath176 ratio confirms that this is an extreme case where matter ( bright and dark ) is highly concentrated .",
    "this high mass concentration also fits in with the picture of the orbits of gas captured through a merger event decaying within a few gyr and aligning with the plane of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this implicitly assumes that there is no extended dark halo to maintain gas orbits in a warp for a long period of time .    regarding the apparently falling rotation curve ,",
    "there are several other galaxies ( @xcite ( ngc  7793 ) , @xcite ( ngc  2683 , ngc  3521 ) , @xcite ( a few galaxies among their 967 spiral galaxy sample ) , @xcite ( ngc  4244 ) , @xcite ( ngc  4138 ) , @xcite ( 11 galaxies ) , @xcite ( the milky way , among others ) , and @xcite ( ngc  7631 , kug  2318 + 078 ) ) in which the rotation curve begins to decline close to @xmath177 .",
    "however , in most of these cases the measurements do nt go much further than this radius and this might be the reason why no convincingly declining rotation curves have been found to date .",
    "so , keplerian declines are rare .",
    "@xcite list 11 galaxies for which with some confidence one can state that the rotation curve falls significantly ( by 50100kms@xmath178 ) . the most extreme case , and in fact a system quite similar to ngc  404 , is the galaxy ngc  4138 which was observed by @xcite .",
    "was detected out to 2.5 optical disc radii ( 16 scale  lengths ) .",
    "this gas is counterrotating with respect to the main stellar body , suggesting recent capture of a gas rich satellite , like in the case of ngc  404 .",
    "but unfortunately , also in this case difficulties in fitting the rotation curve prevents the authors from unambiguously confirming a keplerian decline .    in the case of ngc  404",
    "nature is playing tricks on us and decided to put this object close to face  on , making it impossible to solve separately for the inclination and rotation speed in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "hence , we decided to analyse two extreme options for the intrinsic rotation curve : a flat rotation curve out to the last measured point ( model f ) and a curve following a keplerian decline ( model k ) .",
    "if the rotation curve remains flat , then ngc  404 is one of the `` darkest galaxies '' known with an m / l of 175 and a fraction of 92% of its mass being due to dark matter .",
    "it would also be one of very few galaxies for which a rotation curve out to @xmath2 ( 48 scale - lengths in the @xmath54band ) has been determined .",
    "the only other galaxy for which data up to @xmath2 ( 15 scale - lengths ) are available is ddo  154 @xcite . on the other hand , if this galaxy really follows a keplerian decline , it would be unique . in that case",
    ", the extent of the dm halo would reach out to 3.2 kpc ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "one argument which would favour keplerian decline is that the warp geometry makes more sense and qualitatively fits the picture of accreted material settling within the gravitational potential of the galaxy , the outermost inclined annuli taking longer than the more inward located ones .",
    "an additional argument is that for model k the m / l ratio is more reasonable .",
    "finally , the preference for a keplerian decline is reinforced by the fact that in the case of a flat rotation curve , the inclination of the outer annulus is the same as that of the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "this is at odds with the shape of the outer annulus which clearly gives the impression of having a larger ellipticity which instead would imply a higher inclination .",
    "this is exactly what we find when fitting a the keplerian rotation curve . in this case",
    "we find that 68% of the mass in ngc  404 is in the form of dark matter .",
    "ngc  404 is an exceptionally gas rich early  type galaxy .",
    "the is distributed in two separate systems , a doughnut which extends from @xmath122 or @xmath180 to @xmath104 ( 1.6 to 6.4 kpc for a distance of 3.3mpc ) and an annulus of much lower surface brightness which extends from @xmath104 to roughly @xmath175 .",
    "we derive a total mass of @xmath181 of which 75% resides in the doughnut and the rest in the outer annulus .",
    "this translates to a distance independent @xmath182 ratio of 0.22 in solar units which is high for an s0 galaxy knowing that the median for s0 s galaxies is @xmath183 whereas for sb galaxies this is @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "the velocity field shows a steeply declining rotation curve .",
    "unfortunately , the galaxy is oriented almost face  on and , assuming circular rotation of the gas in annuli , good fits can be obtained when forcing both a flat rotation curve _ and _ a rotation curve that falls off like a keplerian . in both cases",
    "the position angle ( pa ) of the kinematical major axis varies with radius by @xmath185 . in the keplerian decline model ,",
    "the gas in the outer annulus is warped , the annulus moving to a less face  on orientation with radius .",
    "a total mass of @xmath13 is found when using the keplerian rotation curve .",
    "this implies a global @xmath14 ratio of @xmath15 in solar units , which is exceptionally high .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the blue luminosity of the galaxy is @xmath186 times lower than average for an s0 . for a flat rotation curve ,",
    "a lower mass limit of @xmath187 or four times higher is derived , leading to a consequently four times higher total mass  luminosity ratio of @xmath120 .",
    "the nuclear source is detected at 20 cm . if nonthermal , its luminosity of @xmath132 is a factor of ten lower than cas  a and more in line with that of the crab nebula .",
    "if dominated by star formation , the sfr is a low sfr(@xmath140 , 26 o stars being enough to explain the observed luminosity .",
    "given the mass and luminosity of ngc  404 , we are dealing with a dwarf lenticular galaxy .",
    "assuming keplerian decline , the dm halo is compact and ends near @xmath177 .",
    "our preferred explanation for the origin of the ism in this system is that it has been accreted through a catastrophic merger with a gas  rich , dwarf irregular system , less than a tenth of the mass of ngc  404 which has taken place anywhere between @xmath188 yr ago ( no other objects having been encountered within a volume of 1.1mpc radius ) .",
    "gas at small radius has already settled within the plane whereas gas in the outer annulus is still gravitating towards the midplane of the disc defined by the s0 , resulting in a warp of the gas distribution .",
    "although none of our conclusions depends strongly on the rotation curve being flat or declining , it is of course extremely frustrating that it hasnt proven possible to decide between these two extreme models , especially since the observed radial velocities decline so strongly .",
    "this leaves ngc  404 as _ potentially _ the first galaxy with a rotation curve that shows such a pronounced decline over such a large extent which , if confirmed , would be of extreme importance .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge a careful reading by an anonymous referee which has improved the presentation of this paper .",
