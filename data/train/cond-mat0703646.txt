    "the presence of a surfactant film at a fluid - fluid interface alters the dynamics of the interface .",
    "this is manifested in behavior of the interfacial waves , induced either externally or by thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the interfacial dynamics can be probed by measuring the light scattered on such surface waves ( see the review by earnshaw @xcite ) .",
    "the scattering of light on surface waves is a powerful tool for probing the properties of surfactant films at fluid interfaces @xcite , and a variety of systems have been recently investigated using this method ( e.g.  refs  @xcite , see also the review by cicuta and hopkinson @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the application of surfactant films to modify the interfacial properties has been extended to the systems in which one of the fluids is in liquid - crystalline phase ( e.g.  liquid crystal colloids @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of a liquid crystal as one of the fluids complicates the problem of probing the interfacial properties by studying the dynamics of the surface waves for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , there are additional degrees of freedom in the bulk of the liquid crystal phase due to its anisotropy .",
    "secondly , the interaction with the surfactant film is more complicated due to anisotropic anchoring .",
    "finally , the surfactant film in the anisotropic field created by the neighboring liquid crystal can itself show anisotropic behavior , even if it behaves as an two - dimensional isotropic fluid at the boundary between isotropic fluids .    a promising new direction for chemical and biological sensing devices has recently emerged which utilizes the properties of surfactant films self - assembled on the interface between water and a nematic liquid crystal .",
    "the surfactant film induces preferred orientation of the nematic director @xcite .",
    "the adsorption of chemical or biological molecules at such interface can then lead to reorientation of the nematic director , enabling detection by an imaging system @xcite .    in these methods ,",
    "easy detection is limited to the systems in which adsorption changes anchoring properties of the interface with respect to the adjacent liquid crystal phase quite considerably .",
    "namely , the equilibrium anchoring angle should change in magnitude .",
    "the range of application of these systems could be made significantly broader , however , if a method were used that was sensitive to changes in the anchoring properties of the interface that did not necessarily result in nematic director reorientation .",
    "for example , the anchoring orientation may remain unchanged @xcite , the adsorption only changing the strength of the anchoring .",
    "if a small amount of an analyte is present in the water it may be adsorbed at the surfactant layer , provided the surfactant molecules possess appropriate chemical properties . generally , such adsorption will result in a change in the elastic and viscous properties of the interface . hence sensitive experiments which are able to determine the interfacial properties will allow much more detailed experimental insight into the properties of the interaction between the surfactants and the analyte than has hitherto been available , and experimental study of surface waves is a possible technique for this purpose .",
    "the theoretical description of surface waves at interfaces between nematic and isotropic liquids was made back in 1970s @xcite .",
    "the results demonstrated that the spectrum of surface waves has a more complicated structure than in the isotropic case , and allows the use surface scattering experiments to determine properties of nematic interfaces @xcite .",
    "since then , several theoretical and experimental advances have been made , and presently these systems remain a subject of investigation @xcite .",
    "the present paper presents a theoretical study of the dispersion of the surface waves at a monomolecular surfactant film between an isotropic liquid ( e.g.  water ) and a nematic liquid crystal.the main distinguishing features of such interfaces , are ( i ) the anchoring induced by the surfactant layer , ( ii ) the curvature energy of the interface , ( iii ) reduction of surface tension due to surfactant , and ( iv ) the anisotropy of the surface viscoelastic coefficients .",
    "we base our treatment on the mechanical model for anisotropic curved interfaces by rey @xcite , which takes into account anchoring and bending properties of the surfactant .",
    "we consider the case of the insoluble surfactant film that is in its most symmetric phase ( isotropic two - dimensional fluid ) , and induces homeotropic ( normal to the surface ) orientation of the director .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the continuum model used in the rest of the paper",
    "is set up in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : dispersion ]",
    "the dispersion relation for surface waves is derived . in section  [ sec : modes ] the numerical solution of the dispersion relation is solved with typical values of material parameters , and dispersion laws for different surface modes are analyzed in absence of the external magnetic field , and the influence of the magnetic field is discussed in section  [ sec : field ] .",
    "the explicit form of the dispersion relation is written in appendix  [ app : dispersion ] .",
    "in this section we formulate the model of the surfactant - laden interface between an isotropic liquid and a nematic liquid crystal , used in the present paper , and write down the governing equations .",
    "we base our treatment upon the models of the nematic - isotropic interface by rey @xcite , and well known hydrodynamic description of isotropic liquids @xcite and nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "we consider the case when the surfactant film induces homeotropic ( normal to the surface ) orientation of the nematic director , which is usually true in a range of the surfactant concentrations @xcite .",
    "this case is the simplest to analyze , and , at the same time , the most important for biosensing applications where the direct change in anchoring angle can not be always observed .",
    "we include optional external magnetic field in our study and limit our analysis by considering the direction of the magnetic field that does not change equilibrium orientation of the nematic director .",
    "we assume that the system is far enough from any phase transitions both in the surfactant film @xcite and in the nematic phase @xcite .",
    "thus we avoid complications related to the fluctuations of the nematic and surfactant order parameters and the divergence of viscoelastic parameters near phase transitions .",
    "the surfactant films can exhibit rich phase behavior @xcite , and the form of the surface stress tensor depends upon the symmetry of the interface .",
    "however , this does not normally influence much the dispersion laws of the surface modes compared to the isotropic case @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we assume that the surfactant film is in the most symmetric phase ( isotropic two - dimensional fluid ) .",
    "although the symmetry of the film should break in presence of the adjacent liquid - crystalline bulk phase , the film remains isotropic in equilibrium if the anchoring of the nematic is homeotropic , and symmetry breaking can occur only due to fluctuations of the director field .",
    "if we introduce the order parameter for the film , the corresponding anisotropic contributions to the interfacial stress tensor would be of higher order in the fluctuations of the dynamic variables than is required in our linearized treatment , so such contributions can be omitted .",
    "we consider a surfactant layer at an interface between nematic and isotropic liquids to be macroscopically infinitely thin .",
    "we assume that the surfactant film is insoluble and newtonian .",
    "this means that the model is applicable to systems in which the interchange of surfactant molecules between the interface and adjacent bulk fluids is small , and the relaxation of the orientation of surfactant molecules is fast compared to relaxation of surface waves .",
    "we also assume heat diffusion to be sufficiently fast so that the system is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we do not consider systems where other effects , such as polarity , are important .",
    "we shall choose coordinate system in such a way that the unperturbed interface lies at a plane @xmath0 , the half - space @xmath1 is occupied by the uniaxial nematic liquid crystal , and the half - space @xmath2 is filled by the isotropic liquid .",
    "other details of the geometry used in the present paper are summarized in appendix  [ app : geometry ] .",
    "the central equations in the present section are the conditions for the balance of forces ( eq .  ( [ eq : forcebalance ] ) and torques ( eq .  ( [ eq : torquebalance ] ) at the interface .",
    "the explicit form of these equations depends upon the chosen macroscopic model , and the rest of this section is devoted to formulation of the model used in the present paper .",
    "the interfacial force balance equation is the balance between the interfacial force and the bulk stress jump : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the force per unit area exerted by the interfacial stress @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the force per unit area exerted by the isotropic fluid , @xmath7 is the force per unit area exerted by the nematic liquid crystal , the subscript @xmath8 indicates that the bulk stress fields in the isotropic liquid , @xmath9 , and in the nematic , @xmath10 , are evaluated at the interface , @xmath11 is the unit vector normal to the interface and directed into the isotropic liquid .",
    "the interfacial torque balance equation can be cast as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the interfacial torque arising due to surface interactions , @xmath14 is the torque exerted upon the interface by the adjacent nematic liquid crystal .    the explicit model for surface and bulk stresses and torques that enter eqs  ( [ eq : forcebalance ] ) and ( eq .  ( [ eq : torquebalance ] )",
    "is expanded in the remainder of this section .      in this and the following subsections we summarize the equations for the surface stress tensor @xmath5 and surface torque vector @xmath13 .",
    "we represent these quantities as a sum of corresponding non - dissipative ( elastic ) and dissipative ( viscous ) contributions : @xmath15 @xmath16 to describe the non - dissipative contributions in the surface stress tensor , @xmath17 , and surface torque vector , @xmath18 , we use the equilibrium model proposed by rey @xcite , which is summarized below .",

    "the elastic surface stress tensor was found to be @xmath28 where the tangential surface molecular field is given by @xmath29 @xmath30 is surface gradient operator , @xmath31 denotes variational derivative with respect to @xmath11 . the elastic contribution to surface torque",
    "was written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the surface couple stress , @xmath34 is the levi - civita tensor , and @xmath35 is the surface alternator tensor .",
    "the viscous properties of interfaces between an isotropic fluid and a nematic liquid crystal were considered in detail by rey @xcite , and the results are summarized below .",
    "the forces and fluxes that contribute to the dissipation function @xmath36 were identified as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , correspondingly , symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the surface viscous stress tensor @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the components of the surface viscous molecular field tangential and normal to the surface , @xmath43\\ ] ] is the surface rate - of - deformation tensor ( @xmath44 denotes the transposed tensor ) , @xmath45\\ ] ] is the surface vorticity tensor , @xmath46 is surface velocity , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the total time derivatives of the components @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the nematic director field @xmath51 , tangential and normal to the surface , correspondingly .",
    "generally , presence of the surfactant film at the interface complicates the form of the entropy production due to additional internal degrees of freedom of the surfactant , and to the anisotropy of the adjacent nematic liquid .",
    "however , if the surfactant film that is in its isotropic liquid phase and favors homeotropic anchoring of the nematic , the resulting anisitropic terms in the entropy production introduce corrections to the hydrodynamic equations of higher order than linear , and therefore can be neglected in the linearized treatment . since this is the case we are considering , we shall adopt the form of the entropy production ( [ eq : entropyproduction ] ) in our model and use the form of the viscous contribution to the surface stress tensor derived by rey @xcite , which is given by @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the surface jaumann ( corrotational ) derivative @xcite of the tangential component of the director @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , @xmath56 are nine independent surface viscosity coefficients . in the isotropic case @xmath57 , the expression for the surface viscous stress tensor reduces to the viscous stress tensor of boussinesq - schriven surface fluid @xcite with the interfacial shear viscosity @xmath58 given by @xmath59 and dilatational viscosity @xmath60 given by @xmath61    the surface viscous torque , corresponding to eq .",

    ", we can expand the free energy in powers of these quantities and truncate the series .",
    "the result can be represented as @xmath71 each of the contribution described below .",

    "the third contribution to the surface free energy density , @xmath80 , is caused by finite interface thickness , and is related to the difference of the curvature of a surfactant film from the locally preferred ( spontaneous ) value .",
