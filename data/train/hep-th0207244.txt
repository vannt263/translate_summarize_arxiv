    "topology changing transitions in string theory are of great interest @xcite .",
    "these have been well studied in compactifications of type ii string theory on calabi - yau manifolds , where the residual @xmath8 supersymmetry provides much control over the dynamics .",
    "there are two prototypical examples .",
    "the flop transition , in which a two - cycle shrinks and is replaced by different two - cycle , proceeds smoothly in string theory @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the conifold transition , in which a three - cycle shrinks and a two - cycle emerges , is accompanied by a phase transition in the low - energy dynamics which can be understood as the condensation of massless black holes @xcite .    in the past year , there has been great progress in understanding similar effects in compactifications of m - theory on manifolds of @xmath3 holonomy , where the resulting four dimensional theories have @xmath9 supersymmetry .",
    "there is , once again , an analog of the flop transition ; this time three - cycles shrink and grow and , as with the calabi - yau example , the process is smooth @xcite .",
    "other @xmath3 geometrical transitions involving shrinking @xmath1 s have also been discussed @xcite .",
    "these proceed via a phase transition but , unlike the conifold transition , do not appear to be related to condensation of any particle state . for related work ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study geometrical transitions in m - theory on eight - dimensional manifolds with @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "since the physics is very similar to the conifold transition in calabi - yau manifolds , let us briefly recall what happens in that case .",
    "as the name indicates , the conifold is a cone over a five dimensional space which has topology @xmath10 ( see figure [ figa ] ) .",
    "two different ways to desingularize this space  called the deformation and the resolution  correspond to replacing the singularity by a finite size @xmath11 or @xmath12 , respectively . in type iib",
    "string theory , the two phases of the conifold geometry correspond to different branches in the four - dimensional @xmath13 low - energy effective field theory . in the deformed conifold phase , d3-branes wrapped around the 3-sphere give rise to a low - energy field @xmath14 , with mass determined by the size of the @xmath11 . in the effective four - dimensional supergravity theory",
    "these states appear as heavy , point - like , extremal black holes . on the other hand , in the resolved conifold phase",
    "the field @xmath14 acquires an expectation value reflecting the condensation of these black holes .",
    "of course , in order to make the transition from one phase to the other , the field @xmath14 must become massless somewhere and this happens at the conifold singularity , as illustrated in figure [ figa ] .",

    "more precisely , we claim that after the geometric transition one finds type iia string theory on @xmath43 , where the d6-brane is replaced by rr flux through @xmath44 .",

    "we further discuss several aspects of m - theory on @xmath0 manifolds , including fluxes , anomalies , parity and supersymmetry . in section 3",
    "we turn to the interpretation of the conifold transition from the low - energy effective action .",
    "we build a consistent picture in which the geometric transition is understood as a coulomb to higgs phase transition in a chern - simons - higgs model . finally ,",
    "in section 4 , we discuss further aspects of the geometry , and the different reductions to type iia string theory by quotienting the @xmath0 manifolds .",
    "we include explicit constructions of the relevant quotient for the brane / flux transition , as well as the d6-brane loci of section 2 . in the appendix , we review the current state of knowledge for the geometry of @xmath50 , and use the methods of hitchin @xcite to determine properties of the metric .",
    "our main interest in this section is to understand the geometric transition between the asymptotically conical ( ac ) @xmath0 manifolds @xmath51 and @xmath34 , both of which are resolutions of the cone on the weak @xmath3 holonomy aloff - wallach space , @xmath52 .",
    "details of the metrics on these spaces are reviewed in the appendix .",
    "here we start by understanding the transition through the relationship to d6-branes spanning coassociative submanifolds of @xmath29 .",
    "the key observation is that d6-branes lift to pure geometry in m - theory @xcite .",
    "we start with a configuration of d6-branes in flat minkowski space @xmath53 , with worldvolume @xmath54 .",

    "we examine the coassociative four - fold geometry discussed by harvey and lawson @xcite . using the equations ( [ homo ] ) , we show that certain transitions between d6-branes can be reinterpreted as geometric transitions between @xmath0 manifolds of the type described in the introduction .",
    "of course , one can also work in reverse and , given m - theory on a non - compact @xmath0 manifold @xmath58 , we may attempt to find a iia description in terms of d6-branes on coassociative submanifolds of @xmath49 .",

    "we leave the analysis of the second case to the interested reader .    in order to describe the locus @xmath59",

    "however , at small distances @xmath90 , the coordinate @xmath80 stabilizes at the finite value @xmath91 , s_0 = ( 16 ) ^1/5 at this point the principal @xmath11 orbit therefore collapses to an @xmath12 bolt at @xmath92 , and the global topology of the surface @xmath59 can be identified with the spin bundle of @xmath12 which we denote as @xmath93 , l = h^1 ^2 ^ 2 [ h1]for this smooth @xmath59 , we may use the formulae ( [ homo ] ) to determine the homology of @xmath58 , the m - theory lift .",
    "we see that @xmath58 is indeed described by a manifold of topology ( [ myfriend ] ) as advertised . in section 4",
    "we show explicitly that this @xmath59 coincides with the fixed point set of a suitable circle action on @xmath94 . in this construction ,",
    "the @xmath69 action of harvey and lawson sweeps out the @xmath0 manifold @xmath58 with a family of submanifolds .",
    "we will further show that the deformation parameter @xmath95 , which measures the size of the @xmath12 bolt of @xmath59 , is related to the radius of the @xmath22 bolt of @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the coassociative cone over the squashed three - sphere ( [ lime ] ) describes the reduction of the @xmath0 cone over the squashed seven - sphere .    for this case , the d6-brane picture shows no sign of a geometrical transition to a manifold with different topology .",
    "let us now turn to an example where such a transition does occur .",
    "we turn now to the main theme of the paper ; the geometrical transition that occurs in the @xmath0 cone over the weak @xmath3 holonomy aloff - wallach space , @xmath52 .",
    "let us start with the familiar resolution of this space to ^4 ^2 the isometry group of this space is @xmath96 .",
    "a further symmetry arises from the @xmath67-field .",
    "the relevant cohomology groups are @xcite h^2(;u(1 ) ) = u(1)_j = h^2(n_1,-1;u(1 ) ) which ensure that there is a single unbroken global symmetry , denoted @xmath97 , in the low - energy dynamics of m - theory compactified on @xmath28 .",
    "remarkably , the calibrated d6-brane locus which lifts to the manifold @xmath51 is described by the same harvey - lawson curve ( [ curve ] ) that we met in the previous section . to see this ,",
    "consider the conical d6-brane described by the branch ( [ lime ] ) . to this",
    "we simply add a further flat d6-brane , lying on the locus s=0 [ flatharry]the final configuration is depicted in figure ( [ hlfigb]b ) .",
    "these two coassociative submanifolds coincide at the conical singularity @xmath98 . to resolve this singularity",
    ", we may deform the upper branch by @xmath99 in the manner described in the previous section , while leaving the flat d6-brane described by ( [ flatharry ] ) unaffected .",
    "the resulting coassociative four - manifold @xmath59 , shown in figure ( [ hlfigb]c ) , is simply the disjoint union l = h^1 ^ 4 [ niceone]from equation ( [ homo ] ) , we see that this indeed has the requisite topology in order to lift to @xmath28 . from the d6-brane perspective",
    ", the global @xmath97 symmetry corresponds to the unbroken gauge symmetry on the flat d6-brane .",
    "it is worth noting that this result is reminiscent of the d6-brane description of the @xmath3 holonomy manifolds with topology @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "in this case , the addition of an extra flat d6-brane is also responsible for the difference between the @xmath22 and @xmath1 non - contractible cycle .",
    "we are now in a position to see the geometrical transition from the d6-brane perspective .",
    "we simply note that there is a second resolution of the singular locus @xmath59 given by the union of ( [ lime ] ) and ( [ flatharry ] ) .",
    "this arises as another branch of the smooth curve ( [ curve ] ) , where 0 < s < 2 r in this situation , the two disjoint d6-branes smoothly join to lie on this branch as shown in figure ( [ hlfigb]a ) .",
    "the turning point of the curve occurs at @xmath102 .",
    "note that every point on the curve @xmath103 is mapped into a three - sphere under the @xmath69 action ( [ hlaction ] ) .",
    "since this branch has both @xmath104 and @xmath105 , there are no degenerate orbits and we conclude that the topology of the coassociative submanifold is given by l ^3 [ lfirstres ] this branch of @xmath103 has two asymptotic components , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , whose @xmath69 orbits coincide with the boundary of @xmath108 . taking the @xmath109 limit returns us again to the singular description of two d6-branes .",
    "figure ( [ itchyandscratchy ] ) depicts a cartoon of the d6-brane transition in space - time .    from the homology relations ( [ homo ] ) , we see that a d6-brane placed on @xmath110 lifts to a @xmath0 manifold of topology x^3 ^ 5 for this manifold @xmath66 is trivial , ensuring that there are no symmetries associated with the c - field in m - theory .",
    "this reflects the fact that there is no longer a flat d6-brane in the iia picture .",
    "we conclude that the geometrical transition between coassociative submanifolds of topology @xmath111 lifts in m - theory to a geometrical transition of @xmath0 holonomy manifolds of topology @xmath112 .",
    "we should point out that there are probably many other non - compact @xmath0 manifolds with conical singularities that arise as m - theory lifts of d6-branes on coassociative submanifolds in @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we already mentioned coassociative cones constructed in @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to study the geometry , and especially the physics , of these examples in more detail .",
    "as we have argued , d6-branes on coassociative cones @xmath59 in @xmath49 lift to conical @xmath0 manifolds in m - theory . in the following section , we will be interested in the dynamics of m - theory on such geometries .",
    "therefore , it will be important to study their deformations and determine whether or not they are @xmath113 normalizable .",
    "the latter aspect determines the interpretation in the low - energy theory : @xmath113 normalizable deformations correspond to dynamical fields , whereas non - normalizable deformations have infinite kinetic energy and should rather be interpreted as true moduli , or coupling constants .    in m - theory on a non - compact ( asymptotically conical ) manifold @xmath58 deformations of the metric , @xmath114 ,",
    "may be @xmath113-normalizable if the asymptotic conical metric is approached suitably quickly .",

    "however , this is not the full story since , in three - dimensions , massive charged particles do not necessarily decouple from the low - energy dynamics . rather , they lead to the generation of chern - simons couplings . since we have `` integrated in '' the d4-brane state @xmath14 to describe our effective theory , we must compensate by the introduction of a bare chern - simons coupling in our theory .",
    "this is such that , upon integrating out the massive d4-brane , the effective chern - simons coupling vanishes . to determine this chern - simons coupling , we need both the charge of the chiral multiplet @xmath14 , and the sign of the mass of the fermions .",
    "the former is determined by ( [ eng17bra0 ] ) to be @xmath254 , while the latter may be fixed , by convention , to be positive .",

    "this follows from the fact that @xmath132 transforms in the same way as the ns - ns 2-form field , whose own transformation properties may be deduced from ( [ eng3den0 ] ) . since the action of parity in iia string theory coincides with the action in the low - energy three - dimensional theory , the signs of the fermion masses are reversed .",

    "unlike the previous case , the `` integrating in '' of two chiral multiplets with opposite fermion masses means that no bare chern - simons term is generated .",

    "the initial problem is to find the appropriate @xmath60 isometry along which to embed the m - theory circle .",

    "that is , the @xmath60 subgroup @xmath361 that produces the b - picture for the @xmath0 manifold @xmath51 also produces the l - picture for the @xmath0 manifold @xmath335 .",
    "this is most peculiar , and it is not clear to us whether or not there is any deep underlying reason for this fact .",
    "the asymptotically conical @xmath0 manifold @xmath94 was first constructed in @xcite , and is a resolution of the cone on the weak @xmath3 holonomy squashed seven - sphere @xmath170 .",
    "there is a single modulus @xmath362 corresponding to the radius of the @xmath22 bolt .",
    "the isometry group is @xmath65 .",
    "a generic principal orbit @xmath363 may therefore be viewed as the coset space      where we have labelled @xmath364 and @xmath365 denotes the diagonal subgroup of @xmath366 .",
    "the seven - sphere @xmath170 then fibers over @xmath367 with fibers being copies of @xmath368 .",
    "this is the quaternionic hopf fibration .",
    "the circle action on @xmath370 is free , but when we descend to @xmath325 the special orbit @xmath1 under the action of @xmath96 is fixed .",
    "the circle action on the @xmath2 special orbit merely rotates around the hopf fibers over the dual copy of @xmath1 .",

    "the deformation parameter @xmath95 , which measures the size of the @xmath12 bolt , corresponds to the deformation parameter @xmath382 of the @xmath0 geometry which is essentially the radius of the @xmath22 bolt .",
    "as we take both parameters to zero , we obtain a conical geometry in each case : a cone on the weak @xmath3 squashed seven - sphere in m - theory and a coassociative cone on a squashed three - sphere for the d6-brane worldvolume in type iia .",
    "it remains to identify the @xmath383 action of harvey and lawson with part of the unbroken symmetry group in ( [ s4symmetry ] ) , and also to understand the action of the additional @xmath60 factor .",
    "to do this we will follow a similar route to @xcite , although we will not spell out all of the details .",
    "let us view the @xmath22 bolt of @xmath58 as the unit sphere in @xmath384 .",
    "then @xmath385 acts on this four - sphere via the usual action of @xmath386 .",
    "consider the subgroup @xmath387 .",
    "then @xmath361 restricts to the diagonal @xmath388 and we get a decomposition ^5 = ^2 ^3[r5 ] where the two - plane @xmath389 is rotated and the copy of @xmath344 is fixed .",
    "the set of fixed - points on @xmath22 is therefore a copy of @xmath390 , which is also the subset of @xmath391 in which the homogeneous coordinates are complex .",

    "the boundary @xmath393 of this three - disc is thus identified with the fixed @xmath12 .",
    "conversely , the @xmath75 subgroup of @xmath394 acts canonically on the factor of @xmath344 in ( [ r5 ] ) , and thus acts on the fixed two - sphere @xmath395 .",
    "if we now view this two - sphere as the unit sphere in @xmath81 , then @xmath69 acts by conjugation of quaternions .",
    "this is precisely the action we were looking for .",
    "thus the @xmath69 factor in the unbroken symmetry group ( [ s4symmetry ] ) is identified with @xmath396 .",
    "the remaining factor of @xmath60 is identified with @xmath397 which acts trivially on @xmath22 .",

    "the details are left as an exercise for the interested reader , or , alternatively , may be found in @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to identify the remaining group actions .",
    "the zero section of @xmath407 descends to the closed three - disc , @xmath403 .",
    "deleting the fixed point set gives the open three - disc @xmath408 which is of course diffeomorphic to @xmath409 .",
