    "the dipole force in a standing - wave light field has been used to create nanoscale patterns with beams of neutral atoms for many years .",
    "the standing wave can act as an array of optical lenses to focus the atoms during deposition onto a substrate , thereby creating a one - dimensional structure .",
    "the first experiments using this technique were performed ten years ago with sodium @xcite and chromium @xcite atoms . since then , atom lithography with aluminium @xcite , cesium @xcite , metastable argon @xcite , and metastable neon @xcite has also been reported . for an overview of atom lithography ,",
    "see ref .",
    "the results of a number of these experiments have been compared with semi - classical numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "these calculations are based on a dipole force that is derived from an optical potential to focus the atoms in the standing light wave .",
    "this force is conservative and does not take into account the velocity dependence .",
    "quantum - mechanical calculations have been performed as well  @xcite .",
    "these calculations do not suffer from this restriction . however , they are computationally intensive and describe the atomic motion in one dimension only .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate in detail the 3d atomic motion through a standing - wave light field using a semi - classical approach with a non - conservative , velocity dependent dipole force .",
    "the results of these simulations are compared with calculations using the conventional model with a conservative dipole force .",
    "the model presented in this paper follows the approach of minogin and serimaa @xcite , where the dipole force is represented in the form of a fourier series , with coefficients that are calculated with a continued fraction method .",
    "previously , a similar model was used to calculate a one - dimensional beam profile of sodium atoms in the far field @xcite .",
    "the model that is presented here describes a full 3d simulation of the motion of metastable helium atoms through a standing light wave for the purpose of atom lithography applications .",
    "not only the usual low power regime , where the atoms are focused in the standing light wave , is investigated , but also a higher power regime . in the latter regime the atoms channel through the standing wave , undergoing a damped oscillation around the potential minima of the light field .",
    "this is of special interest for lithography , as it allows the production of nanostructures with relative insensitivity to the exact alignment of atomic beam , substrate , and light field .",
    "it is , however , also at these higher laser powers that the potential model is expected to break down and the inclusion of the velocity dependence of the force is essential .",
    "experiments in this novel regime with metastable helium atoms have been performed and , in a future paper , the experimental pattern widths will be compared with the calculations presented in this paper . with metastable helium atoms , nanoscale structures can be created in a gold film on a silicon substrate via a two - step process @xcite .",
    "first , the high internal energy of the focused helium atoms ( 20  ev ) in the @xmath0 metastable state is used to selectively damage an organic resist layer through the standing light wave .",
    "next , the pattern is transferred to the underlying gold film by means of a wet etching process .    in the simulations ,",
    "the light field is blue detuned from the @xmath1 optical transition ( @xmath2  nm ) of the helium atom .",
    "the atoms are therefore attracted to the intensity minima of the standing light wave , which minimizes spontaneous emission of photons by the atoms .",
    "the atomic motion is calculated using only the dipole force .",
    "the atomic momentum diffusion due to fluctuations of the dipole force is neglected .",
    "the momentum diffusion is caused by the variation in the number of absorbed and emitted photons , and by the random direction of the spontaneously emitted photons .",
    "furthermore , the atom is assumed to remain in a steady state , i.e. , transient effects of the dipole force are neglected . in order to investigate the effects of momentum diffusion and transient effects , some results from monte carlo wave function ( mcwf ) calculations similar to lee @xcite",
    "are presented as well .",
    "these calculations include the velocity dependence of the force , momentum diffusion , atomic diffraction as well as transient effects . however , they are one - dimensional and require significant computational resources .    in the next section , a general expression for the dipole force is derived , and both semi - classical models are outlined .",

    "a convergence analysis has shown that the dipole force change is negligible at higher accuracies of the coefficients @xmath71 and when more terms are added to the fourier series .",
    "therefore the level of convergence is assumed to be sufficient .",
    "the calculations are performed on a beam of helium atoms in the @xmath0 metastable state , which has a lifetime of about 8000  s. the atomic beam has a mean longitudinal velocity of 2000  m / s and a longitudinal velocity spread ( full width at @xmath74 height ) of 650  m / s .",
    "after collimation of the beam , the transverse velocity spread of the atoms is reduced to about 3  m / s . for the calculations , each atom is assigned a longitudinal and transverse initial velocity that is randomly picked from gaussian velocity distributions with the above described averages and spreads .",
    "the light of the standing wave has a wavelength of 1083  nm , driving the @xmath1 optical transition of the helium atom , which has a natural linewidth @xmath75  mhz . by detuning the light field relatively far to the blue side of the atomic resonance ( @xmath76  mhz ) ,",
    "the atoms are attracted to the nodes of the standing - wave light field , which reduces spontaneous emissions .",
    "an upper limit for the detuning forms the @xmath77 state , which energy level lies 2.3  ghz above the @xmath78 state . for very large blue detunings of the light field from the @xmath78 state ,",
    "the atom can thus interact with the light field via the @xmath79 transition .",
    "the rabi frequency can be calculated from the intensity of the light field as @xmath80 where @xmath81  mw/@xmath82 is the saturation intensity of the optical transition and @xmath83 is the intensity profile of the standing - wave light field , given by @xmath84 the gaussian light beam has a circular beam profile with a waist ( @xmath74 radius ) @xmath85 m .",
    "the quantity @xmath86 is the intensity of the light field at the anti - nodes of the standing wave and it is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the power of the incident light beam .",
    "depending on this power , two different regimes can be distinguished for guiding the atoms through the standing - wave light field . at low power ,",
    "the atoms can be focused at the centre of the gaussian light beam .",
    "for large detunings ( @xmath89 ) , the power required for this focusing can be calculated from @xcite @xmath90 this focusing power is independent of the waist of the light beam .",
    "for the conditions mentioned above , @xmath91  mw . for high - power light fields , the atoms oscillate through a potential minimum of the standing wave and the sign of the transverse velocity of the atoms changes many times .",

    "the dipole force in the channelling regime is then about one order of magnitude larger than in the focusing regime .",
    "the velocity dependence of the @xmath38-component of the dipole force in the focusing and channelling regime for both models is depicted in fig .",
    "[ velodep ] .",
    "the graphs show that , in the focusing regime ( left graph ) , the difference between the dipole force according to the potential model and the minogin model is very small ( at most 0.3% ) . in the channelling regime ( right graph )",
    ", however , the dipole force of the two models differs significantly .",
    "the force shows a negative slope for small transverse velocities ( @xmath93 ) , which means that the force is a damping force .",
    "this cooling effect is essentially the `` blue - detuned sisyphus cooling '' introduced by dalibard and cohen - tannoudji @xcite . at larger velocities ,",
    "the dipole force in the minogin model is significantly larger than in the potential model .",
    "it is therefore expected that the distinction between the two models will be most pronounced in the channelling regime .",
    "furthermore , in the channelling regime , the minogin model shows some resonance peaks at high atom velocities .",
    "these are called doppleron resonances @xcite , and occur when the atom is excited to the @xmath78 state by multiple photon absorptions and emissions . when an atom absorbs ( @xmath94 ) photons from one wave of the standing - wave light field , and emits @xmath95 photons into the other , these resonances appear at velocities @xmath96",

    "the graphs cover half a wavelength ( @xmath99  nm ) of the standing - wave light field , showing exactly one potential minimum through which the atoms travel in the positive @xmath44-direction ( from left to right ) . to allow the atoms to experience a maximum dipole force , the starting @xmath43-position is @xmath100 for all atoms .",
    "however , since the simulations are 3d and the atoms have an initial velocity in the @xmath43-direction , this position is not maintained while travelling through the light field .    since the velocity dependence of the dipole force in the focusing regime is almost negligible ( see fig .",
    "[ velodep ] ) , the atomic motion in this regime according to the potential model ( upper left graph ) is very similar to the calculation with the minogin model ( upper centre graph ) . in the channelling regime ,",
    "the calculated trajectories differ considerably for the potential model ( lower left graph ) and the minogin model ( lower centre graph ) , due to the higher average value and the strong velocity dependence of the dipole force in the latter model ( see fig .  [ velodep ] ) .",
    "the potential model is invalid in this regime , since the atoms have a transverse velocity spread of 3  m / s ( @xmath101 ) , and the transverse velocity of the atoms can even become on the order of 10  m / s in the standing wave . in the channelling graph of fig .",

    ", the light - field does not act as a perfect lens , but shows some abberations .",
    "this imperfection is enhanced by the longitudinal and transverse velocity spread of the atoms . as a result , the best position to place the sample is not at the centre of the light beam @xmath108 , but slightly behind it . for the channelling regime ,",
    "the sample position is far less critical , but the best results are at similar positions .",
    "therefore , the comparison of the two regimes for the different models in fig .",

    "[ traject ] , the differences between the two models are negligible .",
    "the distributions in the channelling regime with the potential model ( third plot ) and the minogin model ( fourth plot ) show that the atoms are confined for a wider range along the @xmath43-axis as compared to the focusing regime .",
    "furthermore , for the minogin model , the atoms are more localized to the nodes of the standing wave .    to make a more quantitative comparison of the four plots of fig",
    ".  [ xyplots ] , histograms of the atom distributions are presented in fig .  [ histograms ] .",
    "only the atoms located between @xmath110 m and @xmath111 m are taken into account for the histograms , because atoms outside this region do not contribute to the desired pattern ( in the focusing regime ) .",
    "the black curves through the histograms are lorentzian fits from which the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the distribution can be deduced .",
    "the upper graphs , that represent the calculations in the focusing regime , show that the fwhm of the distribution is 150  nm for both semi - classical models as well as for the quantum - mechanical model . for the calculations in the channelling regime ( lower graphs ) , the distribution of the potential model ( left graph ) has a fwhm of 98  nm .",
    "this width deviates clearly from the distribution of the minogin model ( centre graph ) , which has a fwhm of 40  nm .",
    "the smaller width of this distribution can be explained from the additional cooling force that is included in the minogin model .",
    "the distributions for the full quantum - mechanical calculations are shown in the right graphs .",
    "the fwhm of the central peak is 45  nm , somewhat larger than the results from the continued fraction semi - classical results .",
    "this larger width is mostly due to the fact that the steady - state situation for the atoms is not completely realized during the interaction time .",
    "achieving a steady state requires a number of spontaneous emissions per atom . due to the large detuning of the light field from atomic resonance , and due to the fact that the atoms are channelled in the region of low light intensity",
    ", almost one half of the atoms never undergoes a spontaneous emission .",
    "the influence of diffusion is seen in the wings of the mcwf distributions",
    ". however , overall the mcwf results agree very well with the semi - classical calculations using the minogin model , confirming the large reduction in the fwhm of the distribution due to the cooling force .",
    "the simulations have shown that nanoscale patterns can be created utilizing the optical dipole force to guide atoms through a standing - wave light field . for the calculation of the atomic motion ,",
    "two models have been applied : a simple one that uses the conventional dipole force , derived from a potential , and another one that includes the velocity dependence of this dipole force . in the ` conventional ' focusing regime , where a low - power light field is used , the differences between the potential model and the minogin model are negligible .",
    "both models show that in principle nanoscale pattern sizes of 150  nm can be achieved with the specified experimental parameters .",
    "it should be noted , that these parameters are not optimized for focusing : using a smaller laser focus and more laser power , much tighter focusing can be achieved without entering the channelling regime .",
    "however , the sample position is very critical , and good focusing is only achieved for atoms that pass the light field close to its centre .",
    "the high - power channelling regime , that we are presently using for nanostructure production with metastable helium atoms , is more robust .",
    "it is therefore better suitable for creating narrow patterns . in this regime ,",
    "the minogin model shows strong deviations from the potential model , due to the contribution of velocity dependent terms to the dipole force . because of the large transverse velocity @xmath112 of the atoms in the standing - wave light field , the potential model breaks down and",
    "should not be applied for calculations in this regime .",
    "the results of the calculations with the minogin model show structures with a fwhm of 40  nm .",
    "this model does not take into account the momentum diffusion and transient effects , which leads to broadening of the structure size , as is shown by the mcwf simulations .",
    "however , the mcwf simulations support the results of the minogin model by showing a better confinement of the atoms in the standing - wave light field than expected from calculations with the conventional model .",
    "this is due to an additional cooling force that is not incorporated in the conventional model .",
