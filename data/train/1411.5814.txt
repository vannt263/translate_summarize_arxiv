    "it is known that determining the connectedness ( or the number of connected components ) of real algebraic surfaces is a very hard classical problem in algebraic geometry ( see e.  g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we deal with similar problems relating to the normalized ricci flow on generalized wallach spaces .",
    "the importance of these problems is due to the need to develop a special apparatus for studying general properties of degenerate singular points of ricci flows initiated in @xcite@xcite .",

    "thus the problems under consideration could be reduced to the problem of determining the possible number of roots of @xmath41 in @xmath42 $ ] when @xmath43 .",
    "using maple we have the following explicit expression for @xmath41 : @xmath44                note that the point @xmath57 belongs to @xmath51 , moreover , this is an unique singular point of @xmath51 . since @xmath58 at @xmath59 , then @xmath59 is isolated according to the well - known result in differential geometry of planar curves .",
    "it is clear that the point @xmath60 corresponds to @xmath59 in the initial variables .",
    "it is obvious that every regular point of @xmath51 satisfies the condition @xmath61 .",
