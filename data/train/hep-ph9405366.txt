    "it is well known@xcite that qcd simplifies greatly in the limit @xmath10 , @xmath0 being the number of colors .",
    "not surprisingly , the large-@xmath0 limit has likewise proved to be very useful in studying effective low - energy hadron lagrangians for the strong interactions .",
    "broadly speaking , such effective theories fall into two categories . on the one hand",
    ", there is the straightforward feynman diagrammatic approach in which mesons and baryons are each treated as explicit dynamical fields , while on the other hand , there is the more economical skyrmion picture in which baryons are viewed as solitons constructed from the meson degrees of freedom .",
    "since both these approaches purport to describe the low - energy strong interactions , it follows that if they are sensible , they should be equivalent to one another .",
    "furthermore , this equivalence must hold order by order in @xmath11 the first steps towards establishing such an equivalence are just recently being taken@xcite .    in either approach , a particularly fruitful physical process to examine has been meson - baryon scattering in the large-@xmath0 limit . the present paper furthers this study , taking as a tractable example of a multi - channel lagrangian a variant of the linear @xmath2-model . before we specify the model , and our particular treatment of it , it is helpful to put the present work in historical context .",
    "a review of the relevant theoretical literature over the past decade reveals an interesting sociological phenomenon : there are two disjoint bodies of large-@xmath0 papers devoted to two topologically distinct sets of diagrams , namely _",
    "compton - type versus _ exchange - type graphs , that contribute to the meson - baryon @xmath9-matrix . examples of compton - type and exchange - type graphs are displayed in fig .  1 and fig .  2 , respectively .",
    "topologically , they differ in the following way : in the exchange - type graphs of fig .",
    "2 , it is possible to trace a continuous line from the incoming to the outgoing meson without ever traversing a baryon line segment , whereas in the compton - type graphs of fig .  1 this can not be done . _",
    "_    let us review , briefly , some of the salient points of physics that emerge from the study of each of these two classes of diagrams .",
    "while presently the compton - type graphs ( refs .   ) are much less well understood than the exchange - type graphs discussed below , they nevertheless yield some interesting physics , as follows .",
    "look at figs .",
    "1a and 1b .",
    "since each vertex scales like @xmath12 ( see ref .  ) , these graphs individually scale like in the large-@xmath0 limit , where @xmath13 is the baryon s 4-velocity , @xmath14 is the momentum imparted by the incoming meson ( assuming the incoming baryon to be on shell ) , and it is also understood that one throws away the two small components of the dirac 4-spinor .",
    "we focus on the kinematic regime @xmath15 so that the baryon propagators do not affect the @xmath0 counting . ]",
    "@xmath16 however , we know from witten s analysis of quark - gluon diagrams that the total amplitude for meson - baryon scattering must scale like @xmath17 not @xmath16 therefore there must be leading - order cancellations between figs .",
    "1a and 1b .",
    "add to this observation another important piece of large-@xmath0 physics : the fact that for the case of two light flavors ( which we focus on exclusively herein ) the spectrum of stable baryons is a tower of states of equal spin and isospin : @xmath18 , which are all degenerate in the large-@xmath0 limit ( more precisely , in the limit @xmath19 ) .",
    "we then demand leading - order cancellation between figs .",
    "1a and 1b , for the reason described above , with the three baryon legs drawn from all possible baryon states in the @xmath4 tower , consistent with triangle inequalities for isospin and angular momentum at each vertex .",
    "this exercise is carried out in refs .   and .",
    "the upshot is a set of proportionality relations between the various coupling constants @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 and so forth up the @xmath4 tower , relating each of these _ a priori independent couplings to a single underlying coupling constant , up to multiplication by clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "we call this set of relations for the pion - baryon couplings the `` proportionality rule . ''",
    "furthermore , dashen and manohar have shown that corrections to the proportionality rule do not occur at order @xmath23 as naively expected , but rather at order @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that the proportionality rule should be relatively robust .",
    "calculationally , it implies that , once the order @xmath0 contributions to the amplitude have cancelled , the surviving order @xmath25 pieces arise solely from the @xmath8 corrections to the baryon propagator , and not from @xmath8 corrections at the vertices , as one might have thought . _    numerically , the proportionality rule for the pion - baryon couplings works well .",
    "not only does the decay width of the @xmath5 work out to within a few gev of its measured value when @xmath26 is related , using this rule , to the experimental value of @xmath27 ; but furthermore , with the same input parameters , the widths of the `` large-@xmath0 artifacts , '' _ i.e. the baryons with @xmath28 are so large that they can not be considered `` particles '' at all , and as such , pose no problem for phenomenology .",
    "this latter observation removes what has been , till recently , one of the chief objections to the entire large-@xmath0 program .",
    "another success of large @xmath0 is that the group - theoretic predictions of the old @xmath29 symmetry are recaptured , without the need to appeal to the construct of the nonrelativistic , weakly interacting constituent quark model . _",
    "a further refinement was made recently by jenkins , who examined the one - loop chiral corrections to the masses @xmath30 of the @xmath4 baryons , and deduced the consistency relations @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constants of order @xmath0 that can be fixed , for example , by pegging @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , to the experimental nucleon and @xmath5 masses .",
    "while the large-@xmath0 results of refs .   are derived using effective lagrangians of mesons and explicit baryons , the physics of the compton - type graphs can also be accessed using the skyrmion approach .",
    "the parallelism between the two approaches is manifest in expressions such as eq .",
    "( [ jenkinseqn ] ) . in the language of the two - flavor skyrme model , @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "are interpreted as the mass and moment of inertia of the soliton , respectively .",
    "it is reassuring that the expression ( [ jenkinseqn ] ) can also be gotten directly from looking at quark diagrams in large-@xmath0 qcd , closing the circle .",
    "next we turn to the physics of the exchange - type graphs ( refs .  ) , which is the primary focus of this paper .",
    "examples are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "these graphs likewise contribute to the scattering amplitude starting at order @xmath36 although the summation of _ all such graphs would appear to be an impossible task , it can actually be carried out in a straightforward manner  so long as one contents oneself with the leading - order answer in the @xmath8 expansion . as will be reviewed in detail in the sections to follow , the key idea is to rewrite these multiloop graphs as _ trees , exploiting the large-@xmath0 approximation .",
    "tree graphs have the great advantage over loops that they can all be summed by solving _",
    "classical equations of motion .",
    "limit , thanks to the proportionality rule as well as the @xmath37 rule reviewed below .",
    "_ ] it is this summability property which justifies our earlier statement that the exchange - type graphs are much better understood than the compton - type graphs . _",
    "_ _    while the analysis of this paper will be carried out using explicit baryon fields , the set of classical equations that emerges is , once again , highly reminiscent of the skyrmion approach , in which the corresponding classical equations describe a pion propagating through the background field generated by the skyrmion itself .",
    "in particular , the group - theoretic relations familiar from the skyrme model carry over intact to models such as the present one with explicit baryons .",
    "these include non - trivial , and experimentally reasonably well satisfied , relations in which isospin-@xmath38 @xmath1 scattering amplitudes are expressed as linear combinations of the isospin-@xmath39 amplitudes .",
    "similar relations hold for kaon - nucleon scattering , and for @xmath40 , and in fact for all quasielastic meson - baryon scattering processes .",
    "if , extending donohue s original suggestion , one crosses these relations among scattering amplitudes from the @xmath41-channel to the @xmath42-channel ( _ e.g. , @xmath43mesons ) , they can be re - expressed concisely as two large-@xmath0 selection rules .",
    "first , there is the very same `` proportionality rule '' discussed earlier , in the context of the compton - type graphs .",
    "however , the derivation given in ref .   makes clear that the proportionality rule is _ completely independent of the chiral limit , and furthermore , that it applies not only to the pion - baryon couplings but equally to the baryon couplings of _ all bosons . beyond the width calculations noted above",
    ", the phenomenological validity of the proportionality rule is put to the test in fig .",
    "7 of ref .  , in which the appropriate linear combinations of the experimental @xmath6 and @xmath44 scattering amplitudes are compared .",
    "_ _ _    in addition , a second large-@xmath0 selection rule emerges , the `` @xmath37 rule '' .",
    "this rule states that the isospin of the emitted / absorbed meson must equal its _ total ( spin + orbital ) angular momentum , measured in the rest frame of the large-@xmath0 baryon .",
    "concrete examples of meson - nucleon couplings that satisfy the @xmath37 rule include the pseudovector coupling of the pion , the tensor coupling of the @xmath45 and the vector coupling of the @xmath46 : @xmath47 each of which must be augmented by couplings to the entire tower of @xmath4 baryons as required by the proportionality rule .",
    "since these couplings obey the @xmath37 rule , the three coupling constants are nonvanishing at leading order in the large-@xmath0 expansion : @xmath48 in contrast , the @xmath37 rule _ forbids at leading order the other two canonical vector - meson interactions , the _ vector coupling of the @xmath49 and the _ tensor coupling of the @xmath50 @xmath51 meaning that these coupling constants must be down by ( at least ) one power of @xmath8 compared to eq .",
    "( [ nonvanishing ] ) : @xmath52 the relative unimportance of the vector ( tensor ) coupling of the @xmath49 ( @xmath46 ) has long been known to nuclear physicists who construct one - boson exchange models of the nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "it is pleasing to see these phenomenological rules of thumb emerge as theorems in the large-@xmath0 limit . _",
    "_ _      in lieu of a conclusions section , we close this expanded introduction with two questions that are food for further thought .",
    "first , is the complete meson - baryon @xmath9-matrix properly obtained by adding the compton - type and exchange - type graphs together , or , as an alternative prescription , might it be the case that either set of graphs _ by itself ( assuming an infinite spectrum of mesons ) contains the complete answer ?",
    "this latter possibility is suggested by the observation that mesons and baryons are composite particles made up from quarks and gluons . since at the quark - gluon level",
    "there is no longer a topological distinction between the graphs of fig .  1 and fig .  2",
    ", one must be especially careful to avoid double counting , and this might conceivably preclude adding the graphs of fig .  1 and fig .  2 together in a naive way . _    second , the exchange - graph formalism of ref .",
    "applies not only to the meson - baryon system which we focus on here , but equally to the baryon - baryon , baryon - antibaryon , baryon - baryon - baryon , and in general to all @xmath53-baryon , @xmath54-antibaryon interactions ( fig .  3 )",
    "of course , there are no analogs of compton - type graphs for these multi - baryon systems .",
    "it follows that the exchange - graph formalism of ref .",
    "gives  in principle_the complete answer _ for these cases , to leading order in @xmath11 by this we specifically mean the following : given an effective hadron lagrangian whose meson - baryon couplings properly embody the @xmath37 and proportionality rules , the complete set of feynman diagrams of the sort exhibited in fig .",
    "3 can be summed to leading order in @xmath11 it would be an interesting exercise to carry out this program , starting from a well - motivated effective lagrangian , and to compare the results to the popular bonn and paris potential models ( which are derived from just the ladder diagrams with at most one crossing ) as well as to the recent work of weinberg and others that relies exclusively on chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sections ii and iii",
    "we review the exchange - graph formalism of ref .   and apply it to two warm - up problems , a `` @xmath2-only '' and a `` @xmath3-only '' model , respectively .",
    "sections iv - vi explore in detail the meson - baryon @xmath9-matrix in a richer model comprising both pions and @xmath2 mesons , a variation on the gell - mann - levy @xmath2-model .",
    "obviously , we do not take this model seriously as a realistic depiction of hadron physics .",
    "rather , we aim only to illustrate how the formalism of ref .",
    "leads in a concrete way to a quantitative calculation of the exchange - graph contribution to the multi - channel meson - baryon @xmath9-matrix .",
    "with the present model solved , the scene is set for more ambitious , realistic calculations , necessarily incorporating vector mesons .",
    "we are also interested in comparing the large-@xmath0 effective lagrangian approach that uses explicit baryons , with earlier large-@xmath0 results from the skyrme model .",
    "we come to the conclusion that much of the detailed structure of the meson - baryon @xmath9-matrix which hitherto has been uncovered only with skyrmion methods , can equally be described by models with explicit baryon fields .",
    "at the same time , both approaches share significant problems in the low partial waves , the complete resolution of which remains a major technical hurdle .",
    "as a first calculation , let us consider a model with only @xmath2 mesons and ( non - strange ) baryons @xcite . because the @xmath2 has @xmath55 , this toy model avoids the spin and isospin complications due to non - commutativity of pauli matrices at the meson - nucleon vertices .",
    "it also avoids the complications of inelastic 2-body channels ( @xmath56 nucleons can not turn into @xmath5 s ) .",
    "the lagrangian to be solved in this section is the large-@xmath0 version of : @xmath57 where , for definiteness , the @xmath2 self - interactions are described by the fourth - order potential @xmath58 by the words `` large-@xmath0 version of '' we mean that the coupling of the @xmath2 to the nucleon in eq .",
    "( [ siglagn ] ) must , in principle , be augmented by analogous couplings to the entire @xmath4 tower of large-@xmath0 baryons , starting with the @xmath5 ( @xmath59 ) and continuing through the state with @xmath60 .",
    "the relative strengths of these couplings is given by the proportionality rule @xcite .",
    "however , in this simple model , since the @xmath2 carries the quantum numbers of the vacuum , it couples diagonally to this tower ( as noted above ) .",
    "therefore , so long as we restrict our attention to nucleon targets , we can safely drop these additional couplings to the higher baryon states and work with the simplified lagrangian ( [ siglagn ] ) .    in the large-@xmath0",
    "limit the nucleon has mass of order @xmath0 and its degrees of freedom freeze out .",
    "this means that the nucleon kinetic energy term in eq .",
    "( [ siglagn ] ) can be dropped , and the yukawa term has @xmath61 replaced by a static source @xmath62 . the formal derivation of this intuitive prescription was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    ", we review it here . looking at fig .  4",
    ", the product of the nucleon propagators ( reading from bottom to top ) is @xmath63 in the above we have taken the large-@xmath0 ( _ i.e. , nonrelativistic ) limit of the nucleon propagators @xmath64 assuming that the nucleon is in its rest frame .",
    "the prefactor @xmath65 is the projector onto the large components of the dirac 4-spinor . from now on we suppress it , with the understanding that we always throw away the small components . _    our desired result is obtained by summing over the @xmath66 crossed ladders ( fig .  5 ) , and using the interesting identity for distributions , @xmath67 ( to prove this , fourier transform both sides of this identity in all @xmath53 momenta . )",
    "each of the @xmath66 terms in this sum corresponds to a distinct crossing or ordering of the @xmath53 rungs of the ladder .",
    "the @xmath68-function on the left - hand side of this equation reflects conservation of energy along the nucleon line in the large-@xmath0 limit : @xmath69 recognizing @xmath70 as the 4-dimensional fourier transform of @xmath71 we immediately understand the meaning of the simple factorized right - hand side of eq .  ( [ eqb ] ) in terms of graphs .",
    "simply put , the sum of the @xmath66 crossed ladders is equal to the _ single _ graph of fig .",

    "the reason one considers only trees is that meson loops are suppressed by powers of @xmath8 . in the second stage ,",

    "next , solving for the propagating field @xmath77 , as given by fig .",
    "8 , is accomplished by noticing that at every vertex , there are exactly two @xmath77 legs , the rest being insertions of @xmath76 , with the coupling constants read off from @xmath79 .",

    "this is reminiscent of the skyrmion approach to meson - baryon scattering . in the subsequent sections , when pions are introduced ,",
    "this correspondence will be sharpened by the emergence of a hedgehog structure to the classical pion field that is familiar from the skyrme model .",

    "we therefore view it as a model - independent success of the large-@xmath0 approach , whether one chooses to use skyrmions or explicit baryon fields .      from the partial - wave amplitudes",
    "it is easy to extract the baryon resonance spectrum of the large-@xmath0 @xmath2-@xmath3 model . rather than record when the phase - shifts cross 90 degrees ( a crude criterion sensitive to background potentials ) ,",
    "a more robust definition of a resonance , adopted by experimentalists , is to look for lorentzian peaks in the `` speed plots , ''",
    "i.e. , the plots of @xmath316 versus @xmath317 the speed plots for a few selected partial waves are depicted in fig .",
    "some peaks are unambiguous , whereas others are admittedly `` in the eye of the beholder , '' but the same can be said about the corresponding experimental data .",
    "figure 19 displays the full resonance spectrum obtained in this fashion , through the @xmath318-waves ( @xmath319 ) , limited to what we subjectively consider to be  two - star \" resonances or better .",
    "the step - like structure , in blocks of alternating parity , is much more pronounced than in the skyrme model , and certainly than in nature .",
    "it can be partially accounted for by noting that , for @xmath320 the reduced amplitudes of fig .",
    "16 dominate those of figs .",
    "14 - 15 , so that for any fixed value of @xmath321 the resonance location in the four physical partial - wave amplitudes can be approximated by the resonance location in the single underlying reduced amplitude @xmath322 but this does not explain why the steps arrange themselves by definite parity ( as we have indicated by the black bars below the horizontal axis ) , a feature for which we have no good understanding .    in general , the resonances in the @xmath2-@xmath3 model occur at substantially lower energies than in the skyrme model , and in nature .",
    "we have not explored the parameter space of our model [ see eq .",
    "( [ params1 ] ) ] in an attempt to rectify this disparity ( as we are confident could be done ) , not just because of the computationally - intensive character of these multi - stage calculations , but also due to the frankly `` toy '' intent of this model , which we have constructed for illustrative purposes .",
    "we are optimistic that a more realistic model , incorporating the vector mesons , and properly implementing chiral symmetry , would be in better agreement with the observed baryon spectrum , while posing no significant additional conceptual or numerical difficulties beyond those we have already confronted herein .",
    "the one parameter that we _ have experimented with is the nucleon size parameter @xmath89 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) , which acts as an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "a variation from our nominal value @xmath323fm to @xmath324fm shows no discernible effect on the resonance positions , and only slight changes in the argand plots themselves , primarily in the @xmath325-waves , one of which is shown in fig .",
    "_      we have seen that this large-@xmath0 @xmath2-@xmath3 model ( and , we presume , others like it with explicit baryon fields ) shares some notable successes with the skyrme model  the big - small - small - big pattern , the energy - independent relations between the @xmath326 and @xmath327 @xmath1 amplitudes , the overall richness of the baryon resonance spectrum , etc .",
    "moreover , the high - energy behavior of the partial wave amplitudes is much better than in the skyrme model ( see sec .",
    "not surprisingly , the @xmath2-@xmath3 model also shares some of the skyrme model s failings .",
    "figure 21 illustrates a specific partial wave amplitude in the @xmath2-@xmath3 model , juxtaposed with the experimental data .",
    "obviously the real - world amplitude is much more inelastic than the present model .",
    "this is because , in the higher partial waves especially , multiple pion production soon dominates the experimental @xmath1 amplitudes . yet , _ formally , processes such as @xmath328 are down by powers of @xmath8 compared with @xmath329 , and are therefore entirely absent from leading - order theoretical treatments such as the present paper  as well as from the leading - order skyrmion treatments , which share the same problem . below the @xmath2 threshold ,",
    "the only source of inelasticity in the present model is the @xmath330 channel , exactly as in the skyrme model .",
    "a theoretical means of summing at least _ some of the @xmath8 corrections , namely those associated with multiple pion production , would immeasurably improve either approach .",
    "_ _    just as serious is the failure of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model to bear even passing resemblance to experiment in the @xmath9 and @xmath325 waves .",
    "as is well known , these waves have been the `` achilles heel '' of the skyrme model too .",
    "interestingly , whereas the skyrme model shows _ too few resonances in these waves , the @xmath2-@xmath3 model errs in the opposite direction : _ too many resonances , particularly in the @xmath331 and @xmath332 waves , and including spurious bound states in the @xmath333 and @xmath334 channels as already noted in sec .  v. the interested reader",
    "is referred to ref .   for a lengthy discussion of the problems in these lower waves in the skyrme model , which are related , in part , to the failure to incorporate the translational and ( iso)rotational recoil of the hedgehog ( formally @xmath8 corrections , but numerically important ) .",
    "we expect that commentary to apply as well to models with explicit baryon fields .",
    "for example , the weinberg - tomozawa expression for the @xmath1 scattering lengths , which are predicted by current algebra , and which dominate the experimental @xmath9-wave amplitudes near threshold , formally appear only at next - leading order in @xmath8 .",
    "this suggests that if one were to start from an improved effective hadron lagrangian that respects chiral symmetry ( we remind the reader that the present @xmath2-@xmath3 model does _ not ) , and if one were to calculate to next - leading order in @xmath23 the most glaring disagreement with experiment in the @xmath9-waves ought to be repaired .",
    "fixing the @xmath325-waves will require , at the least , ( @xmath240 ) the splitting of the @xmath5 from the nucleon ( again , a @xmath8 effect ) , and ( @xmath335 ) the incorporation of the compton - type diagrams , particularly figs .",

    "the above iterative procedure was programmed in fortran and was originally run as a batch job on a vax - vms minicomputer from a terminal command line . for small values of @xmath97 ( i.e. , small non - linear contributions ) the program would converge reasonably well . however , as the non - linearity was increased , corresponding to values of @xmath97 given by eq .",
    "( [ params ] ) , the convergence became more delicate .",
