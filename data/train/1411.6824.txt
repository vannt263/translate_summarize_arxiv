    "the spatial distribution of the population in a country is typically far from homogeneous , but rather exhibits fractal patterns .",
    "specifically , this has been investigated for great britain and the united states  @xcite and for finland  @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out in  @xcite that fractality has important implications for the design of wired telecommunication networks in the sense that the number and extent of various levels of hierarchy should be adapted to the fractal geometry .",
    "a trade - off is involved in determining the optimal number of levels . using few levels",
    "has the advantage that most access points can be connected by a small number of hops .",
    "however , this comes at the cost of having to install a cable network of large total length .",
    "indeed , a high - level node has to be connected to a large number of low - level nodes in order to guarantee connectivity .",
    "vice versa , using a large number of hierarchies , one may be able to reduce the length of cables substantially , but this comes at the cost of increasing the number of hops it takes a low - level node to reach the topmost layer of hierarchy . a related cost analysis for hierarchical spatial networks",
    "is provided by baccelli and zuyev  @xcite .",
    "however , the network structure investigated in that paper is obtained by iteratively considering voronoi tessellations and does not exhibit fractal geometries ( see however  @xcite for some results in this direction ) .    in order to develop a fundamental understanding of the asymptotic behavior of cable lengths and chemical distances ( i.e. , minimal number of hops needed to connect two points ) in large networks , it is important to abstract from the types of specific countries and deterministic fractals investigated in  @xcite and move to random networks .",
    "the spatial nature of the problem calls for models based on random geometric graphs , and the fractal geometry suggests that one should look for scale - free random graphs exhibiting a power - law degree distribution . the combination of these two constraints restricts the list of appropriate choices substantially .",
    "we briefly review some of the most well - known models in literature and discuss their drawbacks with respect to modeling the kind of networks we have in mind",
    ".    one option could be to use long - range percolation , see  @xcite and the references therein . here",
    ", one starts from the lattice @xmath2 and connects any pair of sites independently with a probability depending only on their distance .",
    "this leads to a network with a giant connected component and power - law degree distributions .",
    "however , this model does not offer an inherently defined hierarchy of nodes .",
    ", if we think of a high - level node as having the purpose of providing access to all low - level nodes in some region , then this would suggest that the occurrence of edges should be spatially positively correlated .",
    "however , if @xmath3 are arbitrary sites in @xmath2 and @xmath4 is close to @xmath5 , then putting an edge between @xmath6 and @xmath5 does not influence at all the probability of seeing an edge between @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "a second option could be to consider the ultra - small scale - free geometric networks on @xmath2 introduced in  @xcite .",
    "two sites @xmath3 are connected by an edge in this graph if @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes a family of iid heavy - tailed random variables .",
    "for any site @xmath9 the value @xmath10 can be thought of as the radius of influence of @xmath11 , ultra - small scale - free geometric networks offer a natural possibility for defining the network hierarchy .",
    "similar remarks apply to scale - free percolation  @xcite .",
    "recently , also a poisson - based continuum analogue of this model has been investigated , see  @xcite . from a modeling point of view , this means that there is an excellent degree of connectivity between high - level nodes .",
    "however , conversely , for low - level nodes it may be very difficult to get connected to a nearby high - level node .",
    "this might pose a substantial obstruction to the build - up of a hierarchical network .",
    "due to the drawbacks of the existing networks models , we propose two alternatives .",
    "according to our discussion , it would be desirable to consider a variant of the ultra - small scale - free geometric network , where two sites @xmath3 are connected by an edge if @xmath12 ( instead of @xmath7 ) .",
    "in other words , in order to connect @xmath6 and @xmath5 by an edge it is no longer necessary that both @xmath6 lies within the radius of influence of @xmath5 _ and _ @xmath5 lies within the radius of influence of @xmath6 .",
    "it suffices that @xmath6 lies within the radius of influence of @xmath5 _ or _",
    "@xmath5 lies within the radius of influence of @xmath6 .",
    "we consider a spatial variant of this network model , called _ scale - free gilbert graph _",
    ", where the vertices are given by a homogeneous poisson point process on the @xmath0-dimensional torus with side length @xmath13 , for some @xmath14 . see figure  [ sfbmfig ] for an illustration of this graph in dimension @xmath15 .",
    "0.45    0.45    as @xmath16 , we investigate the asymptotic distribution of the power - weighted sum of all incoming and all outgoing edge lengths considered from a vertex that is picked uniformly at random , see theorems  [ outedgethm ] and  [ inedgethm ] .",
    "in particular , our results imply that the asymptotic out - degree and in - degree distributions admit polynomial tails",
    ". we also investigate the growth of the expected power - weighted sum of all outgoing edge lengths as @xmath16 , see theorem  [ asygrowprop ] . in section  [ chemdistsec",
    "] , we show that different scaling regimes of chemical distances emerge depending on the tail index of the radius distribution .    since the scale - free gilbert graph exhibits a large degree of redundancy of connections , in section  [ multisec ] we present a variant , called _ thinned scale - free gilbert graph _",
    ", that substantially decreases these redundancies by introducing a multi - layer topology . loosely speaking , an edge in the original graph from a low - level node @xmath6 to a high - level node @xmath5 is removed if @xmath5 can also be reached from @xmath6 via an intermediate node @xmath11 .",
    "see figure  [ onnfig ] for an illustration of the thinned scale - free gilbert graph .",
