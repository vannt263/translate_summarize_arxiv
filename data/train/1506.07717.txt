    "a recent study by @xcite using the plateau de bure interferometer derived the d / h ratios of methanol ( ch@xmath1doh and ch@xmath32od ) at comparable resolution to our sma observations .",
    "a notable result is that the spatial distribution of formaldehyde emission ( hdco and h@xmath1@xmath17co , see fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] ) clearly differs from that of ( deuterated ) methanol ( see fig . 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the methanol distribution follows a v - shaped structure linking the hot core component to the compact ridge @xcite while formaldehyde exhibits a spatial structure which appears to surround this molecular v - shaped structure on four sides .",
    "this difference is illustrated in figure  [ fg2 ] ( bottom right panel ) in which the deuterated methanol emission peaks identified by @xcite are indicated on the hdco integrated emission map at at 193391.6  mhz . furthermore , the d / h ratio for methanol derived by @xcite lies in the range 0.81.3@xmath010@xmath38 , which is up to an order of magnitude ( within the uncertainties ) lower than the d / h ratio for formaldehyde derived in this study ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "all the nearby well  characterized sources ( i.e. hot core , compact ridge ) are not coincident with formaldehyde emission . in fact , it is possible and even likely that we are seeing quiescent material surrounding the hotter sources , such as the well  known quiescent ridge in orion  kl .",

    "we determine the abundance ratio of h@xmath1co / ch@xmath32oh in the formaldehyde clumps .",
    "comparison to ratios measured towards other pdrs would then illuminate whether the orion pdr is influencing the local chemistry of dense material surrounding the hot embedded cores .    the determination of the methanol column density ( see eq .",
    "2 ) relies on the assumptions that the ch@xmath32oh  e transitions listed in table  [ tab3 ] are optically thin and , that the rotational temperature is the same as that of h@xmath1@xmath17co .",
    "it is important to note that toward the df1 and df2 emission peaks the ch@xmath32oh  e lines are strongly blended ( see figure  [ fg6 ] ) , preventing us from deriving the column density of methanol at those positions .",
    "regarding the df3 and df4 regions , the resulting h@xmath1co / ch@xmath32oh abundance ratio lies in the range 3.54.5 , that might suggest a slight decrease in the methanol abundance in the quiescent ridge .",
    "however , our derived ratio is lower by at least a factor of 3400 in comparison to that estimated by @xcite toward the orion bar , suggesting that the production of formaldehyde in orion  kl through photodissociation of gas - phase methanol is not the main formation route .",
    "finally , it is noticeable that our estimated h@xmath1co / ch@xmath32oh abundance ratio is more consistent with that found in hot  corino regions ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this finding leads us to argue that formaldehyde emission in orion ",
    "kl is more likely probing the edge of the hot gas .",
    "formaldehyde and methanol are believed to be formed on ice grain mantles during the pre - stellar cold phase ( t@xmath3950  k ) from successive hydrogenation reactions of h or d atoms with co ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus , if methanol and formaldehyde both purely originate from ice grain mantles , the measured d / h ratio should be similar ( within a factor 2 ) for both molecules and , in particular , these molecules should trace similar environments while desorbed as they share a common origin .",
    "this is inconsistent with our observations ( see section  [ sec : anti ] ) and thus strongly argues in favor of differences in the chemical formation pathways of these deuterated molecules .",
    "thus ch@xmath32oh and h@xmath1co emission is probing different spatial regions within the central region of orion kl that may not be coeval .",
    "we infer that a likely scenario is a hdco production through hot gas - phase deuterium chemistry in the colder gas associated with orion  kl , as suggested by @xcite . more specifically , at * relatively * high temperature ( t@xmath570k100k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as that derived in this study ( see figure  [ fg5 ] ) , reaction  [ eq5 ] is active due to its high exothermicity ( @xmath42e of 654  k , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and favors deuterium fractionation through reactions involving ch@xmath1d@xmath7 as a parent molecule @xcite .",
    "@xmath43 in that context , reaction  [ eq5 ] can then lead to the formation of hdco and h@xmath1co ( see further details in * ? ? ?",
    "incidentally , the temperature of this colder region associated with orion - kl is not sufficient enough to desorb ch@xmath32oh from the surface of icy grain mantles ( t@xmath4120160  k see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the inner hottest part of orion  kl where methanol emits , most of the formaldehyde might have been converted into methanol by grain surface reactions @xcite during a colder phase prior to the explosive event .",
    "then , upon heating methanol is released from grain surfaces into gas phase along with little formaldehyde .",
    "we stress that the release of methanol into gas  phase in this region is mainly due to internal radiation heating ( i.e outflow , shock , ir sources ) but not heat from the pdr ( see section 4.2 ) . in this instance",
    ", the d / h ratio and the spatial distribution of methanol should differ from the one of formaldehyde .",
    "we have characterized , for the first time , the spatial distribution of deuterated formaldehyde ( hdco ) toward orion  kl with an angular resolution of 3.4@xmath0 3.0using the sma . the new sma broadband capability of the 230  ghz band allowed simultaneous observation of both hdco and h@xmath1@xmath17co within relatively sparse spectra .",
    "four main emission peaks , labelled in this study df1 to df4 , are identified in the formaldehyde emission image .",
    "a salient result is that the spatial distribution the emission of the hdco and h@xmath1@xmath17co emission differ from that of ch@xmath32oh and its deuterated isotopologues .",
    "the emission maps show that methanol emits in the inner part of orion  kl , while formaldehyde is found in the colder gas enveloping the ch@xmath32oh emission on four sides : one located left of the hot core ( df1 ) , one toward the north of the compact ridge ( df2 ) and two in the quiescent ridge ( df3 and df4 ) .",
    "in addition , we derive a hdco / h@xmath1co ratio which lies in the range of 0.003 to 0.009 within the region ; this value is an order of magnitude higher than the d / h measured for methanol .",
    "we suggest that the high measured d / h ratio for formaldehyde and its spatial distribution in orion  kl are a combination of gas phase chemistry in the cooler gas associated with orion  kl and , a conversion of formaldehyde into methanol on ice grain mantles in the earlier history of the inner part .",
