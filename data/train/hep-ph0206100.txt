    "heavy fermion production processes out of electron positron annihilation , @xmath2 , have become a subject of thorough study in the last years .",
    "their interest embodies multiple features and a wide energy range , from close to threshold production to high  energy colliders .",
    "lep and lep2 have provided the appropriate tool pushing behind this burst .",
    "in addition this is among the scattering processes with higher expected number of events at a future linear collider running in the @xmath3 energy region like tesla and nlc / jlc - x , or clic at higher energies .",
    "their interest arises mainly from the possibility of exploring new physics and , therefore , an accurate description within the standard model is necessary for the analyses of data .",
    "projects like zfitter @xcite and the ongoing calcphep @xcite aim to provide the relevant theoretical framework for that purpose .",
    "qed corrections seem to be of little interest when probing the quantum effects within the standard model , but it is obvious that their contribution , however small , should be considered in order to disentangle new physics effects . besides , if a deeper understanding on the physical parameters of heavy fermions is intended , electromagnetic @xmath4 and heavy quark @xmath5 production out of @xmath6 annihilation at threshold energies supplies the required information .    from a theoretical point of view @xmath7 cross sections close to threshold evaluated within perturbation theory are mislead due to the presence , in the physical system , of a kinematical variable of the same order than the gauge theory coupling  : the velocity of the heavy fermion pair in the center of mass of the colliding system , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the mass of the @xmath10 fermion .",
    "hence , when @xmath11 , care has to be taken in order to resummate terms as @xmath12 or @xmath13 that can give potentially large contributions @xcite .",
    "recently the development of non  relativistic effective field theories of qed and qcd @xcite implements the suitable systematic procedure to follow .",
    "facilities as the proposed tau  charm factory , a high  luminosity @xmath6 collider with a center  of  mass energy near the @xmath4 production threshold @xcite , would provide excellent information on the mass of this lepton @xcite .",
    "moreover an accurate determination of the mass of the top quark ( difficult to get at the next hadron colliders ) requires a future lepton collider at the @xmath14 threshold @xcite .",
    "consequently a thorough study of the non  relativistic contribution to @xmath15 both from electromagnetic and strong interactions is mandatory .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a detailed study of the threshold behaviour of @xmath16 was performed , and it was pointed out that , within the @xmath0 electromagnetic corrections to the born cross section , the squared amplitude of the box diagram involving two  photon @xmath4 production ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : box ] ) had not been considered yet .",
    "the electroweak one  loop contributions to the @xmath7 process were evaluated in ref .",
    "here this box contribution was already taken into account , though an explicit expression was only given for the @xmath17 case . in this paper",
    "we provide the amplitude of this diagram for a final massive fermion .",
    "once the explicit result is worked out we perform its non  relativistic expansion in terms of the @xmath18 velocity and we find that the contribution of this diagram to the cross section is of @xmath19 , that is @xmath20 over the born cross section .",
    "the additional suppression driven by the velocity squared indicates that the contribution of the two  photon box diagram to the production of heavy fermions at threshold is negligible compared to the precision foreseen in the next future .    in section 2",
    "we detail the calculation of the box diagram contributing to @xmath7 in the limit when @xmath21 , and we provide the full analytical result .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to the study of the threshold behaviour of the box amplitude as obtained directly from our previous result .",
    "we confirm the features of this threshold amplitude by performing an alternative analysis of the integrals through the asymptotic expansion method in section 4 .",
    "our conclusions are collected in section 5 .",
    "finally , two appendices contain the basic scalar integrals appearing in the article and a comment on the infrared divergent part of the box amplitude .",
    "the contribution to the @xmath22-matrix of the process @xmath23 of the two  photon box amplitudes is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] and it is defined by @xmath24     _ direct ( a ) and crossed ( b ) box diagrams for @xmath25._,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as we are interested in heavy fermion production we will perform the evaluation for @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( we neglect the electron mass where possible ) .",
    "the two  photon box amplitude is gauge invariant and , consequently , we perform the calculation by taking the feynman choice . the direct box amplitude , fig .  [ fig : box](a ) , is written down following qed feynman rules as  : @xmath28 [ ( \\ell - p)^2-\\lambda^2 ] [ ( \\ell+p^{\\prime})^2-\\lambda^2 ] } \\,\\ , , \\label{eq : amplitude}\\ ] ] where we have introduced a photon mass @xmath29 in order to regularize the infrared divergences known to be present in this amplitude . the crossed box diagram in fig .

    "every integral , containing just one scale , will thus contribute only to a single power in the velocity expansion .",
    "the procedure requires the use of dimensional regularization in handling the integrals , even if they are finite , in order to assure that the result from each regime just picks up the corresponding pole contribution and vanishes outside . following this heuristic rules , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite reproduce the exact @xmath18 expansion of some one - loop and two - loop examples .",

    "we will keep the electron mass finite along the procedure , although much smaller than any other scale , to keep track of the logarithms of @xmath105 present in the box amplitude .",
    "our amplitude @xmath37 is characterized , as shown in the appendix a , by the four point integrals @xmath106 in ( [ eq : ds ] ) . if present , inverse powers of the velocity in @xmath37 can only originate from these integrals .",
    "in addition , we can focus on the behaviour of the scalar integral @xmath57 , as the @xmath107 vectors in @xmath108 and @xmath109 will produce factors of one of the scales of the problem ( @xmath110 or @xmath111 ) in the numerator of the amplitude without affecting the leading singular behaviour in @xmath18 .",

    "more explicitly , the expanded integral in the hard regime , at leading order in @xmath18 , is @xmath146 and there is no need to separate time from spatial components in the integration .",

    "this fact reveals that , as expected , the box production graph is a process dominated by the high scale , as it involves annihilating photons which carry energies of the order of the mass of the non - relativistic fermions .",
