    "this and the subsequent@xcite paper ( termed paper ii ) describe the results of an ab initio quantum dynamical study of the absorption spectrum and the non - adiabatic dissociation mechanisms of carbon dioxide photoexcited with the ultraviolet ( uv ) light between 120 nm and 160 nm .",
    "a brief account of this work has already been published.@xcite paper ii gives the motivation behind the study and discusses its main result  the quantum mechanical absorption spectrum and its interpretation in terms of wave functions of metastable resonance states .",
    "the present paper sets the stage for paper ii and describes the ab initio calculations and the topography of the potential energy surfaces ( pess ) involved in photodissociation .",
    "this information , which is often stashed away in supplementary online sections,@xcite is a central and , indeed , an indispensable ingredient of a reliable dynamics calculation .",
    "the construction of ab initio pess and their diabatization  which , without much exaggeration , amounts to learning the topography of pess and their intersections by heart  is often more challenging than the subsequent quantum dynamical calculation .",
    "photoabsorption from the ground electronic state @xmath3 of linear co@xmath0 at wavelengths 120 nm  160 nm is due to the first five excited singlet valence states @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath4.@xcite in the @xmath8 group notation , appropriate for bent molecule , these states are @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "uv light excites co@xmath0 into the region of multiple electronic degeneracies , nuclear motion through which induces strong non - adiabatic couplings between electronic states .",
    "these couplings directly affect the observed absorption spectrum of the valence states and control distributions of photofragments over the final states .",
    "their indirect influence apparently extends to shorter wavelengths where rydberg transitions dominate : the combined experimental and theoretical analysis indicates@xcite that the manifold of coupled valence states acts as a sink for the optically bright rydberg states and affects their dissociation lifetimes .",
    "electronic degeneracies in the franck - condon ( fc ) region , which have been the focus of several studies in the past,@xcite are of two types .",
    "glancing intersections occur in the orbitally doubly degenerate @xmath6 and @xmath4 states which upon bending split into @xmath11 and @xmath12 components .",
    "conical intersections ( cis ) arise at the accidental @xmath13 crossing inside @xmath11 and @xmath12 symmetry blocks.@xcite in fact , cis between valence states are ubiquitous and found far outside the near - linear fc region , at strongly bent geometries.@xcite together with local minima and saddles , these crossings are the principal features shaping the topography of the singlet valence states .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "section [ abi ] sketches the technical details of ab initio calculations .",
    "next , the constructed adiabatic pess are presented for the ground ( sect .",

    "their intersections are discussed for near linear ( sect .",

    "[ topi ] would be the last step in theoretical ab initio analysis . if , on the other hand , one intends to treat nuclear dynamics quantum mechanically , ab initio pess featuring cis have to be diabatized.@xcite this is especially desirable if  as in paper ii",
    " a discrete grid is used to represent the nuclear hamiltonian , because the diabatized potential matrix is free from either divergent off - diagonal couplings or non - differentiable potential cusps . while general schemes for constructing approximate adiabatic - to - diabatic transformations are established ( see , for instance , ref . )",
    ", their application to the valence states of co@xmath0 is complicated by the number of cis to be simultaneously treated .",

    "[ qd1 ] ) and linear cis ( sect .  [ qd2 ] ) .",
    "section [ concl ] concludes .",
    "all ab initio calculations are carried out with the molpro package.@xcite the gaussian atomic basis sets used in this work are due to dunning.@xcite previous studies indicate that diffuse functions should be added to the basis sets on oxygen and carbon atoms in order to account for the mixed valence - rydberg character of the @xmath14 state.@xcite a series of tests was conducted , in which @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 etc .",
    "basis functions of triple and quadrupole zeta quality were selectively augmented by one or two diffuse functions .",
    "the pre - computed doubly augmented correlation consistent polarized valence quadrupole zeta ( d - aug - cc - pvqz ) basis set,@xcite as implemented in molpro , was found computationally most stable and selected for calculations of global pess .",

    "the resulting energies were scanned in one and two dimensions for obvious errors .",
    "the list of corrected adiabatic energies was subsequently interpolated using 3d cubic splines and also used for constructing the quasi - diabatic representation .",
    "missing energies for @xmath36 in the dissociation channels were obtained from those for @xmath37 using trigonometric extrapolation .",

    "the calculated fundamental frequencies of the infrared active bend ( @xmath56@xmath57 ) and antisymmetric stretch ( @xmath58@xmath57 ) are accurate to within 1.5@xmath57 .",

    "thus , one expects the low energy bands in the absorption spectrum , associated with @xmath80 and @xmath96 states , to reflect highly excited bending motion .",
    "this interpretation is commonly given in the literature:@xcite instead of dissociating directly , the molecule bends first . with growing photon energy , the contribution of direct dissociation through linear geometries will certainly grow ,",
    "because the barrier is only about 0.2ev high and is located @xmath323ev below the fc point . above @xmath324ev , the valence states @xmath87 and @xmath97 will contribute to the observed spectrum .",
    "these linear states are separated from the dissociation asymptote by a @xmath325ev high and broad barrier , with the implication that co@xmath0 in these states can decay only through non - adiabatic interactions with the dissociation continuum of the lower states . in other words ,",
    "one expects to see a resonance - dominated absorption spectrum .",
    "the next qualitative change in the absorption spectrum within the valence manifold can be expected after the photon energy reaches the top of the dissociation barrier in the upper valence states and allows direct dissociation from linearity .",
    "the above discussion is based on 1d and 2d potential cuts and the data in table [ table3 ]  given the adiabatic representation is the adequate one .",
    "however , there is another important piece of information still missing , namely the tdms with the ground state . as has already been mentioned in sect .",
    "[ ex1 ] , the electronic transitions in the wavelength range of 160 nm  120 nm are forbidden .",
    "the bands are observed only because the tdms are not constant but strongly change with molecular coordinates as one moves away from the high - symmetry fc point .",
    "this dependence is a manifestation of the herzberg - teller effect@xcite which plays the leading role in shaping the absorption bands , is at least as important as the potential profiles discussed above , and has to be considered on equal footing with the state intersections .",
    "the discussion of the coordinate dependence of the tdms is deferred to paper ii .",
