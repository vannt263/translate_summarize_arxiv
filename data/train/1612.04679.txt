    "the community detection can be considered as an unsupervised learning problem . while the detection of communities is very similar to the unsupervised clustering situation ,",
    "the network representation of the data resulted in the undesirable behavior of the community detection methods based on typical clustering techniques such as hierarchical algorithms @xcite . on the one hand , applying the tools of network science enhanced the accuracy of the community detection algorithms . on the other hand , complexity and ill - posed essence of the community detection problem have been caused many efforts to get the better solution on a wide variety of applications @xcite .",
    "there exist different categories of the community detection algorithms .",
    "the most well - known are based on the overlapping and non - overlapping structures of the communities @xcite . due to the non - overlapping assumption of the community structures in some applications and sound theoretical roots in graph theory known as graph coloring problem @xcite",

    "are investigated to uncover the community patterns through various heuristic fitness functions and nature - inspired algorithms @xcite .",
    "the earlier works on community detection are suffered from the sensitivity of the initialization of the algorithms , weak accuracy , and leading to many number of communities with singletons . moreover ,",
    "most of the earlier approaches have tried to discover the communities either based on overlapping assumption of the community structures or via non - overlapping ones . while these methods resulted in good performance on a variety of dataset adopted to the predefined assumption of the overlapping , they have failed to devise a general framework .",
    "indeed , the communities can be formed by overlapping and non - overlapping structural elements . in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel generalized approach for community detection via a primary association node based criterion based on the combination of the internal and external association degree .",

    "many researches have been done on various aspects of the community detection topic .",
    "the main contributions in the community detection algorithms are initiated based on the connectivity structures of the networks , overlapping and non - overlapping ones @xcite .",
    "the typical non - overlapping approaches to community detection had been aimed at dividing the network into subnetworks with densely connected internally and weakly connected externally to the others @xcite , although some recent overlapping community detection works are aimed to partition the networks to subnetworks with more dense external connections and less dense internal ones @xcite . while the extension of the non - overlapping methods to detect the overlapping structures would be hardly feasible for most of the algorithms ( and vice versa ) ,",
    "the primary aim of the two main paradigms is to extract the hidden community structures consisting up the overlapping and non - overlapping connectivity patterns .",
    "moreover , the algorithms in the non - overlapping category fail to discover the overall community structures @xcite due to algorithmic restraint and the same problems occurs for the category of overlapping algorithms @xcite .",
    "the main problems for the aforementioned methods are the high sensitivity to the connectivity structures , leading to many communities with singletons , and scalability problems for high - dimensional networks .",
    "there exist some general community detection algorithms including the overlapping and hierarchical detection of community structures@xcite , the fuzzy identification of the community structures @xcite , optimizing several objective functions to find communities based on a general search strategy @xcite , interaction - based edge clustering to detect overlapping and hierarchical communities @xcite .",

    "the main question is how one can design a general framework to extract the community structures without either solely considering the overlapping connectivity patterns and or only the non - overlapping ones .",
    "we propose a unified approach based on the principle of _ `` division of each community into the non - overlap and overlap parts '' _ providing a more robust less sensitive results as compared with the earlier works .",
    "our idea is based on the formation of network communities by considering both of the overlapping and non - overlapping connectivity constituents .",
    "the proposed approach considers a generative stochastic modeling for the overlapping extraction of the communities and a feature extraction approach for internal community structures .",
    "our aim is to construct a general community detection approach in a probabilistic model based framework to detect communities on overlapping and non - overlapping connectivity structures with better accuracy and acceptable computational complexity than the similar ad - hoc overlapping or non - overlapping procedures .",
    "we design an integrated framework through an association node based approach which comprises two elements for considering the whole structure of the connectivity patterns of the network .",
    "indeed , two parameters are regarded as the non - overlap and overlap parts of community memberships for each nodes .",
    "the first parameter `` _ _ ia _ _ '' exploits the local neighbors connectivity behavior of a given node to measure the internal association degree of that node for every community @xcite . although , internal association is suitable to detect the non - overlapping part of community , it acts poorly for covering the overlapping regions of communities .",
    "the second parameter in the proposed approach measures the amount of interactions between communities for each node of a network via a generative stochastic block - models , `` _ _ ea _ _ '' , approach@xcite .",

    "the community detection problem can be stated as discovering groups of nodes like @xmath3 that can be written as @xmath4 . by introducing the essential concepts ,",
    "we give now the relevant definitions to our proposed approach .",
    "internal association denotes the affinity level of each node to the specific community which is defined as , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the neighbors of node @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the community propagation probability that node @xmath9 belongs to community @xmath3 which derived from the edge clustering approach @xcite and @xmath10 equals to the number of neighbors of node @xmath7 .",
    "intuitively , the relation states that a node s level of affinity through a given community depends on the affinity levels of its neighbors with that community .",

    "each node of a network would have two - fold association with communities , the first is related to the internal relationship with the other nodes through a community and the second is related to the external relationship with the nodes from other communities . while , there exist a few works on the detection of the general community structures @xcite , most of the algorithms have been applied the internal or external association of the nodes to uncover the hidden communities in networks that is known as non - overlapping or overlapping techniques in the literature .",
