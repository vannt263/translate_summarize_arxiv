    "the proofs of theorems [ lggiambthm ] and [ qupieri ] , as compared to those for the type @xmath0 grassmannian @xmath209 , are complicated by two facts .",
    "first , a different argument is needed to establish the quantum pieri rule , which is related by proposition [ linenumbers ] to the classical pieri rule on @xmath560 .",
    "second , in the quantum giambelli pfaffian expansion @xmath592_{1{\\leqslant}i",
    "< j{\\leqslant}r}$ ] , there are terms which do involve @xmath360-corrections , and these extra @xmath360-terms cancel each other out in the end .",
    "thus more combinatorial work is required to prove that the pfaffian formula ( [ lgqgiam2 ] ) holds in @xmath564 .",
    "we now turn to the analogue of the above theory in the orthogonal lie types",
    ". we will work with the even orthogonal grassmannian @xmath594 .",
    "this variety parametrizes ( one component of ) the locus of maximal isotropic subspaces of a @xmath595-dimensional vector space @xmath4 , equipped with a nondegenerate symmetric form .",
    "note that there are two families of such subspaces ; by convention , given a fixed isotropic flag @xmath28 in @xmath4 , we consider only those isotropic @xmath103 in @xmath4 such that @xmath596 has even codimension in @xmath597 .",
    "we remark that @xmath598 is isomorphic to the odd orthogonal grassmannian @xmath599 , hence our analysis ( for the maximal isotropic case ) will include both the lie types @xmath241 and @xmath600 .",
    "the schubert varieties @xmath419 in @xmath598 are again parametrized by partitions @xmath486 and are defined by the same equations ( [ lgdef ] ) as before , with respect to a complete isotropic flag @xmath291 in @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath601 be the cohomology class of @xmath469 ; the set @xmath602 is a @xmath446-basis of @xmath603 .",
    "now much of the theory for @xmath598 is similar to that for @xmath454 . to save time",
    ", we will pass immediately to the results about the quantum cohomology ring of @xmath598 .",
    "we again have an isomorphism of @xmath358$]-modules @xmath604 $ ] , but this time the variable @xmath360 has degree @xmath605 .",
    "another difference between the symplectic and orthogonal case is that the natural embedding of @xmath593 into the type @xmath0 grassmannian @xmath606 is degree doubling .",
    "this means that for every degree @xmath89 map @xmath607 , the pullback of the tautological quotient bundle over @xmath598 has degree @xmath608 .",
    "it follows that the relevant parameter space of kernels of the maps counted by a gromov - witten invariant is the sub - maximal isotropic grassmannian @xmath609 .",
    "we pass directly to the corollary of the corresponding ` main theorem ' :        [ oggiambthm ] the ring @xmath612 is presented as a quotient of the polynomial ring @xmath613 $ ] modulo the relations @xmath614 for all @xmath615 , together with the quantum relation @xmath616 the schubert class @xmath601 in this presentation is given by the giambelli formulas @xmath617 for @xmath492 , and for @xmath516 , @xmath618_{1{\\leqslant}i < j{\\leqslant}r}.\\ ] ]    it follows from this that the quantum giambelli formula for @xmath598 coincides with the classical giambelli formula , and indeed the results in the orthogonal case are formally closer to those in type @xmath0 .",
    "one can use the @xmath619-polynomials , defined by @xmath620 for each @xmath9 , to describe the multiplicative structure of @xmath612 .",
    "let @xmath621 denote the @xmath446-algebra generated by the polynomials @xmath622 , for @xmath623 , where @xmath509 .",
    "then the map which sends @xmath622 to @xmath624 for all @xmath510 and @xmath625 to @xmath360 extends to a surjective ring homomorphism @xmath626 with kernel generated by the relations @xmath627 , for all @xmath615 . define the structure constants @xmath628 by the relation @xmath629      [ ogqupieri ] for any @xmath486 and @xmath487 we have @xmath632 where the first sum is over strict @xmath35 and the second over partitions @xmath633 with @xmath634 strict , such that both @xmath35 and @xmath94 are obtained from @xmath21 by adding @xmath57 boxes , with no two in the same column .",
    "the above quantum pieri rule implies that @xmath635 in the quantum cohomology ring of @xmath593 .",
    "we thus see that multiplication by @xmath636 is straightforward ; it follows that to compute all the gromov ",
    "witten invariants for @xmath598 , it suffices to evaluate the @xmath637 for @xmath638 . define a map @xmath639 by setting @xmath640 for any partition @xmath9 of length @xmath641 .",
    "notice that @xmath642 is essentially a type @xmath0 poincar duality map ( for the type @xmath0 grassmannian @xmath643 ) .",
    "partitions in @xmath644 also parametrize the schubert classes @xmath27 in the cohomology of @xmath645 .",
    "the two spaces @xmath593 and @xmath645 have different dimensions and seemingly little in common besides perhaps the fact the the degree of @xmath360 in the quantum cohomology of the former is twice the degree of @xmath360 in the latter . however , if @xmath646 denotes the poincar duality involution on @xmath644 , we have the following result .",
    "[ oglg ] suppose that @xmath647 is a non - zero partition with @xmath648 for some nonnegative integers @xmath89 and @xmath649 . for any @xmath650",
    ", we have an equality @xmath651 of gromov  witten invariants for @xmath593 and @xmath645 , respectively . if @xmath9 is zero or @xmath652 , then @xmath653 .",
    "we remark that the left hand side of ( [ lgogequ ] ) is symmetric in @xmath9 , @xmath35 , and @xmath94 , unlike the right hand side .",
    "this reflects a @xmath654-symmetry shared by the gromov - witten invariants for both @xmath458 and @xmath598 .",
    "in fact , theorem [ oglg ] is essentially equivalent to this symmetry .",
    "the proof in @xcite@xcite proceeds by first establishing the symmetry by a clever use of the quantum pieri rule , and then using the relation between the structure constants of @xmath453- and @xmath619-polynomials to put everything together . as of this writing",
    ", we lack a purely geometric result that would explain theorem [ oglg ] .",
    "the kernel and span ideas in these notes have been used by buch in @xcite and @xcite to obtain simple proofs of the main structure theorems regarding the quantum cohomology of any partial flag manifold @xmath655 , where @xmath656 is a parabolic subgroup of @xmath657 ( the arguments assume the associativity of the quantum product ) . however , in @xcite it is shown that there is no direct analogue of theorem [ thm : typea ] in this generality , at least not for the complete flag manifold @xmath336 .    in recent work with buch and kresch @xcite , we present similar results to the ones described here ( including an analogue of theorem [ thm : typea ] ) for any homogeneous space of the form @xmath658 , were @xmath659 is a classical lie group and @xmath656 is a maximal parabolic subgroup of @xmath659 .",
