    "a common goal in quantum control is to maximize the expected value of a given target operator through application of an external action to the system .",
    "often such an external action is realized by a suitable tailored coherent control field , which steers the system from the initial state to a target state maximizing the expected value of the target operator  @xcite .",
    "a coherent field allows for controlled hamiltonian evolution of the system .",
    "another form of action on the system could be realized by tailoring the environment to induce control through non - unitary system dynamics  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the suitably optimized , generally non - equilibrium and time dependent distribution function of the environment ( e.g. , incoherent radiation or a gas of electrons , atoms or molecules ) is used as a control .",
    "combining this type of incoherent control by the environment with a tailored coherent control field allows for manipulation of both the hamiltonian and dissipative aspects of the system dynamics .",
    "quantum measurements can also be used as an external action to drive the system evolution towards the desired control goal .",
    "there are two general types of quantum measurements : instantaneous von neumann measurements ( selective and non - selective )  @xcite and continuous measurements  @xcite .",
    "if the measured operator is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an eigenvalue of @xmath2 with the corresponding projector @xmath3 , then the result @xmath1 of an instantaneous von neumann measurement of @xmath2 is obtained with probability @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the state of the system just before the measurement .",
    "the state of the system just after the selective measurement with the result @xmath1 will be @xmath6 .",
    "if a non - selective measurement of @xmath2 is performed ( i.e. , if the particular measurement result is not selected ) then the system state just after the measurement will be @xmath7 .",
    "non - unitary dynamics induced by measurement - driven quantum evolution was used recently in  @xcite for mapping an unknown mixed quantum state onto a known target pure state .",
    "this goal was achieved with the help of sequential selective measurements of two non - commuting observables .",
    "after each measurement the outcome was observed and used to decide either to perform the next measurement or to stop the process .",
    "the same problem was studied in the presence of decoherence introduced by the environment  @xcite .",
    "the control of the population branching ratio between two degenerate states by continuous measurements was considered  @xcite , while the effect of non - optimized measurements on control by lasers was investigated  @xcite .",
    "quantum measurements may be used in a feedback control scenario  @xcite . in this approach",
    "continuous observations are performed , a controller processes the results of the measurements , and then based on these results modifications are made in the coherent control field in real time to alter the behavior of the quantum system .",
    "optimal measurements may also be used for quantum parameter estimation  @xcite , where the system state depends on certain @xmath8-number parameters @xmath9 .",
    "the goal is to find an optimal measurement strategy to extract the information about these parameters .    in this paper",
    "we explore nonselective von neumann measurements to control quantum dynamics . any measurement performed on the system during its evolution",
    "has an influence on the dynamics .",
    "in particular , non - selective measurement of an observable with a non - degenerate spectrum acts on a quantum system by transforming its density matrix into diagonal form in the basis of eigenvectors of the operator corresponding to the observed quantity . measuring different observables may produce different changes in the system s state .",
    "we optimize the measured observables such that their consecutive measurement modifies the density matrix to maximize the objective .",
    "the general formulation includes the use of optimal measurements along with a tailored coherent control field .",
    "a particular case corresponds to control only by measurements such that the coherent control field is not applied . for this case",
    "a complete analytical solution is found for a two - level system .",
    "arbitrary target operators and initial states of the system are considered .",
    "the solution includes explicit expressions for the optimal measured observables and the maximal objective values attained . while control by measurements admits an explicit analytical solution for two - level systems , the generalization to the multilevel case is not straightforward .",
    "the situation becomes even more complicated if coherent control fields are used in addition to optimized measurements .",
    "for this case , numerical simulations are performed in  @xcite for several quantum systems controlled by a tailored coherent control field together with optimization by learning control of quantum measurements .",
    "the quantum anti - zeno effect  @xcite can be used to steer the system from an initial to a target state . in the anti - zeno effect continuously measuring the projector @xmath10 steers the system into the state @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a projector leaving the initial state unchanged and @xmath13 is a unitary operator .",
    "continuous measurements in the quantum anti - zeno effect are obtained as the limit of infinitely frequent von neumann measurements . with the anti - zeno effect",
    "the system becomes completely controllable in this limit .",
    "in the laboratory it may be difficult to perform a large number of measurements in a short time interval .",
    "thus , a balance may need to be struck between the number of measurements and the desired degree of control . in this paper",
    "we analytically establish the degree to which the system can be controlled by any given finite number of measurements .",

    "the control goal is to find , for given @xmath36 and @xmath38 , optimal observables @xmath41 which maximize the objective functional to produce @xmath42 .",
    "the general case also includes a tailored coherent electromagnetic field @xmath43 as a control where the dynamics of the system is governed by the two forms of external action : ( a ) measurements of observables @xmath16 at the times @xmath44 , respectively , and ( b ) coherent evolution with a control field between the measurements .",
    "the former action induces non - unitary dynamics in the system .",
    "the latter action produces unitary evolution of the density matrix @xmath45 between the measurements according to the equation @xmath46\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the free hamiltonian of the system and @xmath48 its dipole moment .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) at a time @xmath49 , with an initial condition @xmath50 at @xmath51 is given by a unitary transformation of the initial density matrix denoted as @xmath52 .",

    "this general case is difficult to treat analytically , and for some models numerical simulations may be performed  @xcite . in the next section",
    "we show that control only by measurements admits an analytical solution in the case of a two - level system .",
    "for an atomic multi - level system , practical measurements of the energy level populations can be performed using coherent radiation .",
    "for example , measuring the population of energy levels @xmath58 and @xmath59 of a two - level system can be performed by coupling the ground or the excited level by a laser pulse to some ancilla upper level and then observing the spontaneous emission from the ancilla level to a lower energy level .",
    "such a measurement is described by projectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 and corresponds to measuring an observable of the form @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "this case shows the distinction between the use of coherent radiation for control and for measurements .",
    "the coherent radiation used for controlled unitary evolution generally includes frequencies close to the transition frequencies of the controlled energy levels ( e.g. , levels @xmath58 and @xmath59 for a two - level system ) .",
    "the radiation used for measurements includes components with frequencies close to the transition frequencies between the controlled levels and the ancilla levels , which moreover should be subject to decoherence upon decay to the lower energy levels .",
    "in general , measurements also can be performed through collisions between the system and electrons or atoms when the scattering cross - section depends on the initial state of the system . in this case",
    "the scattering data will provide information on the initial state of the system , thus realizing a measurement procedure .",
    "measurements on a two - level system in an arbitrary orthonormal basis @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be realized using an ancilla system and inducing an interaction hamiltonian between them , which generates a unitary evolution operator @xmath66 such that for any vector @xmath67 of the initial system one has @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the energy levels of the ancilla system .",
    "the unitary operator can be chosen as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the projector onto the one - dimensional subspace of the composite system spanned by the vector @xmath72 .",
    "then , nonselective measurement of the energy level populations of the ancilla system [ i.e. , measurement in the basis of @xmath73 and @xmath69 ] realizes an indirect measurement of the initial system in the basis @xmath64 and @xmath65 and changes its state into @xmath75 .",
    "an indirect arbitrary von neumann measurement on some quantum system can be experimentally realized if the system can be coupled with another appropriate ancilla system ( the ancilla can be identical to the initial system ) and any unitary operator between these two systems can be implemented .",
    "for the case that the measured system is a two - level trapped ion , the ancilla could be another two - level trapped ion .",
    "arbitrary unitary operators between the two trapped ions can be implemented using a sequence of at most three controlled - not ( cnot ) gates and fifteen elementary one qubit gates  @xcite ( i.e. , single ion unitary operations ) .",
    "therefore experimental realizations of cnot two - qubit gates  @xcite together with ability to realize arbitrary one - qubit unitary evolutions allows for generating any two - qubit unitary operator , in particular , the operator @xmath66 from the preceding paragraph .",
    "then the ability to measure the ancilla ion in the energy level basis makes arbitrary measurements on the initial ion practically possible .",
