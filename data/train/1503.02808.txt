    "this net excess charge by itself will induce a radio signal that can be used to measure the original neutrino .",
    "this askaryan radio emission  @xcite has been confirmed experimentally at slac  @xcite , and more recently the askaryan effect was also confirmed in nature by the radio emission from cosmic - ray induced air showers  @xcite .    for high - energy cosmic - ray air showers , along with the askaryan emission , there is another emission mechanism due to a net transverse current that is induced in the shower front by earth s magnetic field [ 11 - 14 ] .",
    "recently the radio emission from cosmic - ray air showers has been measured in great detail by the lofar collaboration  @xcite , confirming the predictions from several independent radio emission models [ 17 - 20 ] .",
    "most askaryan radio detectors [ 1 - 3,21 - 23 ] search for so - called gzk neutrinos that are expected from the interaction of ultra - high - energy cosmic - ray protons with the cosmic microwave background  @xcite .",
    "the expected gzk neutrinos are extremely energetic with energies in the eev range , while the flux at these energies is expected to fall below one neutrino interaction per cubic kilometer of ice per year .",
    "therefore , to detect these neutrinos an extremely large detection volume , even larger than the cubic kilometer currently covered by the icecube experiment , is needed .",
    "due to its long attenuation length , the induced radio signal is an excellent means to detect these gzk neutrinos .",
    "this has led to the development of several radio - detection experiments  [ 1 - 6,26 - 30 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the highest - energy neutrinos detected so - far are those observed recently by the icecube collaboration  @xcite and have energies up to several pev , just below the energies expected from the gzk neutrino flux .    in this article",

    "can be treated by a direct rotation of the geometry , we do not expect the emission to change significantly .",

    "furthermore , it should also be noted that for more inclined geometries , a larger part of the signal created in air will be reflected off of the surface suppressing the in - air emission over the in - ice emission even more .    the most important effect , however , will be due to the change of the total number of charges hitting the air - ice boundary .",
    "since for larger zenith angles the shower traverses a longer distance through air , the total number of particles actually hitting the air - ice boundary changes .",
    "other effects influencing the total number of particles hitting the air - ice surface are the chemical composition and the energy of the primary cosmic ray .",

    "the total number of particles hitting the air - ice boundary becomes smaller , and for zenith angles larger than @xmath92 degrees the shower dies out before hitting the air - ice boundary . hence no transition radiation and in - ice",
    "emission will be observed for showers at zenith angles larger than approximately @xmath93  degrees .",
    "m ( full lines ) and @xmath88  m ( dotted lines ) for a typical proton shower with a primary energy of @xmath89  ev ( red lines ) and @xmath90  ev ( blue lines ) . ]",
    "[ fig : n_zenith ]      one important question to consider is how the cosmic - ray air shower signal compares to the emission from a neutrino induced cascade in ice .",
    "this is shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : e - field - comp ] . for the cosmic - ray air shower signal",
    ", we consider both the in - ice emission as well as the transition radiation component just below the boundary . as follows from  fig .",
    "[ fig : e - field ] , the in - air emission is very small and will therefore be ignored for this comparison .",
    "m ( dashed blue line ) and @xmath88  m ( dotted purple line ) .",
    "the observer is positioned at a lateral distance @xmath94  m perpendicular to the shower axis . ]",
    "[ fig : e - field - comp ]    the neutrino induced cascade is modeled by taking a @xmath62  ev primary neutrino interacting at the surface of the air - ice boundary , after which the cascade develops in ice .",
    "the observer is positioned 100  m below the ice surface at a distance @xmath81  m perpendicular to the shower axis .",
    "the effective width of the particle distribution is taken as @xmath95  m , approximately corresponding to the dimensions of the cascade front in ice .",
    "it follows that the emission from a typical proton induced high - energy cosmic ray air shower hitting the ice surface is of similar magnitude compared to the askaryan signal from a neutrino induced particle cascade in ice of the same energy . since the total number of particles hitting the air - ice interface is slightly larger at @xmath88  m for the considered geometry of a vertical cosmic - ray air shower ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : n_zenith ] ) , the transition radiation gets slightly enhanced with respect to the emission seen at @xmath87  m.    the direct consequence is that the radio emission from a high - energy cosmic ray air shower will be very hard to distinguish from the emission of a high - energy neutrino induced particle cascade without directional information about the signal .",
    "another possible method to separate the cosmic - ray air shower from the neutrino induced cascade might be obtained by adding a surface veto to the array .",
    "we derived an analytical expression for coherent transition radiation from a particle bunch with a net charge which is traversing from one medium to another .",
    "in addition to the transition radiation also the emission due to a highly - relativistic steady charge and a time - varying current are given .",
    "as a first application we calculate the radio emission from a cosmic - ray - induced air shower hitting an ice layer before the shower has died out . it is shown that a relatively strong transition radiation component can be expected from an air shower when taking an air - ice boundary in the range between 500 - 3000  m above sea level .",
    "the emission from such a cosmic - ray air shower is calculated to be of similar strength as the askaryan signal obtained from an in - ice cascade induced by a gzk - neutrino of similar energy .",
    "furthermore , the polarization of the transition radiation will be similar to the polarization of the askaryan signal .",
    "it follows that without directional information or a surface veto , it will be very hard to distinguish between both signals .",
    "therefore , the emission from cosmic - ray air showers might induce a significant ( background ) signal in the currently operating askaryan neutrino detectors at antarctica .",
    "next to the discussed application for cosmic - ray air showers hitting a dense medium , the transition radiation from neutrino induced particle cascades traveling from a dense medium to air or vacuum is also expected to give a strong signal .",
    "this signal might be a promising probe to detect high - energy neutrino - induced particle cascades escaping dense media .",
    "a more detailed calculation for this component will be given in future work .",
