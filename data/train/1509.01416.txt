    "back in the 60 s of the last century and before the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the theory of strong interactions , r.  hagedorn @xcite proposed the existence of a whole zoo of massive , unobserved hadronic resonance states .",
    "the spectrum of these particles , known as hagedorn spectrum , exhibits the specific feature of being exponential in the infinite mass limit with the slope given by the so called hagedorn temperature @xmath0 .",
    "this temperature denotes the limiting temperature for hadronic matter since any partition function of a hrg with hagedorn - like mass spectrum diverges as long as @xmath6 . above the hagedorn temperature a new state of matter , namely the qgp , shall be realized .",
    "thus , hagedorn states provide a tool to understand the phase transition from hrg to qgp and back .",
    "the hagedorn states are created in multi - particle collisions most abundantly near @xmath0 which in our understanding equals to the critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "hagedorn states are color neutral objects which are allowed to have any quantum numbers as long as they are compatible with its mass .",
    "the appearance of hagedorn states in multi - particle collisions and their role was already discussed in @xcite .",
    "their appearance near @xmath1 can explain , as shown in @xcite , the fast chemical equilibration of ( multi- ) strange baryons @xmath2 and their anti - particles @xmath7 at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energies .",
    "the inclusion of hagedorn states in a hadron resonance gas model provides also a lowering of the speed of sound , @xmath8 and of the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath9 at the phase transition and being in good agreement with lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "the starting point of all calculations provided here is the postulate of the statistical bootstrap model ( sbm ) stating that fireballs consist of fireballs which in turn consist of fireballs etc .  .",
    "as shown in @xcite ( cf .  also @xcite ) the mathematical formulation of this postulate in the formulation of @xcite leads to the evolving bootstrap equation for the density of states , @xmath10 where the conservation of the quantum numbers baryon number , strangeness and electrical charge @xmath11 is guaranteed .",
    "a major aspect was to restrict on hagedorn states , which just consist of two constituents in order to allow for generation processes as @xmath12 and decay as @xmath13 .",
    "this is some necessary constraint in order to allow for a microscopical calculation in a transport model simulation based on cross sections .",
    "the above set of integral equations of volterra type is solved numerically by disretizing the mass range and consecutively stepping to higher mass bins .",
    "the zeroth order input are the known hadrons according their spectral functions as implemented in the transport model urqmd @xcite .",
    "the radius @xmath14 is the only free parameter of the model .",
    "choosing reasonable values as @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) yield hagedorn temperatures , i.e.  the slopes of the exponentially rising hagedorn spectra @xmath17 as @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) nearly independent of the quantum numbers , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : taugam ] .    in order to treat the decay and the production of hagedorn states ,",
    "the decay width @xmath20 and the production cross section @xmath21 are connected via detailed balance as @xmath22 which represents the second major equation of the model .",
    "corresponding hagedorn spectra and their decay width are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : taugam ] .      one observes , that the slope decreases with increasing volume of the hagedorn state . correspondingly also the width decreases .",
    "nevertheless , for larger masses , the width is nearly constant in the range of some hundreds of mev , and also stays finite in the infinite mass limit .    having the total decay width and the corresponding composition ,",
    "one is able to calculate the branching ratios for the decay into light hagedorn states and/or hadrons .",
    "performing such cascading decay simulations , the resulting hadron multiplicity coincide very well with experimentally observed values@xcite .",
    "this is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , where the multiplicity ratios for strange and multi - strange particles are compared with experimental values measured at lhc .",
    "@xmath24@xcite and pb - pb at @xmath25@xmath24 @xcite , both from alice at lhc .",
    "the bands show the range of calculations from cascade decay of a single charge neutral hagedorn state with radius @xmath15 and initial mass @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "right : energy spectra of hadrons stemming from cascade decay of charge neutral hagedorn state with radius @xmath15 and initial mass @xmath26 and @xmath27.,width=207 ]    @xmath24@xcite and pb - pb at @xmath25@xmath24 @xcite , both from alice at lhc .",

    "right : energy spectra of hadrons stemming from cascade decay of charge neutral hagedorn state with radius @xmath15 and initial mass @xmath26 and @xmath27.,height=181 ]    the most striking result is the fact , that the energy spectra of these decay hadrons _ look _ thermal , i.e.  the functional behavior is exponential , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "the slope parameter coincides with the underlying hagedorn temperature .",
    "all these ingredients were implemented into urqmd @xcite , which can handle the creation and the decay of hagedorn states and their component dynamically .",
    "this enables us to perform box calculations and study the time evolution and the equilibration of the system .",
    "the model is able to handle different initialization scenarios , as e.g.  the initialization with only nucleons ( or pions ) with a given particle and energy density .",
    "while this may stand for some bottom - up scenario , alternatively one may start with a given hagedorn state distribution and look into the resulting hadron distributions .",
    "this indicates a top - down scenario , where the hagedorn states may stem from some preceding deconfined phase .",
    "the given multiplcities at some time are the resulting muliplicities , if all particles would decay down to the stable remnants .",
    "one indeed observes very short time scales for the equilibration : while the kaons are almost equilibrated after 2@xmath5 , the number of lambdas reaches values close to the maximum value already after 5@xmath5 .",
    "not shown here , but the last statement holds also for nucleons , while pions are even faster equilibrated than the kaons .",
    "the multiplicity ratios are almost stable for all energy densities , except for the smallest considered one , i.e.  for @xmath29 .",
    "in addition we find , that the energy spectra of the hadrons again follow an exponential shape , with slope parameters very close to the hagedorn temperature @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : temperature ] .",
    "we conclude , that hagedorn states are a valuable tool for the understanding of the phase transition between a deconfined and a hadronic phase . while already the decay particles of one single hagedorn state _ look _ thermal with the hagedorn temperature as the only scale , a collective system of hagedorn states leads to small equilibration times of hadrons in the order of few @xmath30 .",
    "these remarkable features may also open the door for alternative descriptions of heavy ion collisions , where directly from a pure gluonic phase without quarks a transition to the confined phase is possible @xcite ."
