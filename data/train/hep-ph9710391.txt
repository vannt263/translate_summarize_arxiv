    "all of the charged fermion masses , apart from the top quark , are suppressed relative to the electroweak scale .",
    "indeed the most striking feature of their spectrum is the hierarchy of masses and mixing matrix elements : the masses range over five orders of magnitude , from 1/2 mev for the electron to 175 gev for the top quark . the most promising way of explaining this hierarchy is in terms of mass suppression factors , due to the partial conservation of some chiral flavour quantum numbers beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in section [ sec : mass ]",
    "we consider a model @xcite based on the anti - grand unified theory ( agut ) gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "this means that , near the planck scale @xmath4 gev , each quark - lepton generation has its own set of gauge fields quite analogous to those of the standard model group @xmath5 .",
    "in addition there is an extra abelian gauge group called @xmath6 .",
    "we shall characterize the @xmath3 group as the maximal agut group , satisfying some relatively simple assumptions , in section [ sec : max ] .",
    "this gauge group is supposed to break down to the standard model group @xmath7 , as the diagonal subgroup of @xmath8 , about one order of magnitude below @xmath9 .",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , measured in units of @xmath9 , of the higgs fields responsible for the breakdown provide the required fermion mass suppression factors .    in section [ sec : top ] we present a precise determination of the top quark and higgs boson masses within the pure sm , based on the principle of degenerate vacua and a strongly first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "the values of the yukawa coupling constant @xmath10 and the higgs self - coupling @xmath11 then take on fine - tuned values , rather analogous to a mixture of ice and water taking on a fine - tuned temperature equal to zero degrees celsius . in winter one",
    "often finds a mixture  slush  of ice and water .",
    "this is due to the large latent heat of water giving a strongly first order phase transition between ice and water .",
    "we assume that the sm is valid up close to the planck scale ; the strongly first order phase transition condition then implies that the sm effective higgs potential should have two degenerate minima , with the corresponding difference in higgs field vevs being of order @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath3 group , with its 37 generators , at first seems a rather arbitrary choice for a  unified group \" .",
    "however it can be characterized uniquely as the gauge group @xmath12 beyond the sm ( i.e. having smg as a subgroup ) satisfying the following 4 postulates :    1 .",
    "@xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the group of all unitary transformations of the 45 species of weyl fields ( 3 generations with 15 in each ) in the sm .",
    "2 .   no anomalies . there should be neither gauge anomalies nor mixed anomalies .",
    "we assume that only straightforward anomaly cancellation takes place and , as in the sm itself , do not allow for a green - schwarz type anomaly cancellation @xcite .",
    "the various irreducible representations of weyl fields for the smg remain irreducible under @xmath12 .",
    "this postulate is motivated by the observation that combining sm irreducible representations into larger unified representations introduces symmetry relations between yukawa coupling constants , whereas the particle spectrum exhibits a hierarchy between essentially all the fermion masses rather than exact degeneracies .",
    "@xmath12 is the maximal group satisfying the other 3 postulates .",
    "a rather complicated calculation shows that , modulo permutations of the various sm fermion irreducible representations , we are led to the result @xmath15 with the usual smg embedded as the diagonal subgroup of @xmath8 .",
    "apart from the various permutations of the particle names , the @xmath6 group is unique .",
    "the @xmath6 charges @xmath16 can then be chosen so that the only non - zero values are carried by the right - handed fermions of the second and third proto - generations : @xmath17",
    "the yukawa couplings of the sm fermions to the weinberg - salam higgs field @xmath18 are mainly forbidden by the gauge quantum numbers of the agut group . in the agut theory",
    ", these transitions between the left- and right - handed weyl fields also involve the higgs fields responsible for the breakdown of the @xmath19 group .",
    "we assume that all the fundamental couplings of the agut theory are of order unity and that there exists a rich spectrum of vector - like fermion states at the planck scale , which can mediate all the required transitions",
    ". then the gauge quantum numbers of the quark - lepton and higgs fields determine the combinations of higgs fields needed to provide non - zero values for the various elements in the effective sm yukawa coupling matrices @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the up quarks , down quarks and charged leptons respectively .",
    "we have the freedom to choose the quantum numbers of the higgs fields and , guided by phenomenology , we select four higgs fields s , w , t and @xmath23 , in addition to @xmath18 .",
    "in fact we specify their u(1 ) charges and use a natural generalisation of the sm charge quantisation rule to determine their non - abelian representations .",
    "the higgs field s is supposed to have a vev of order unity in planck units and , therefore , does not contribute to the fermion mass suppression . in this way we find the following order of magnitude sm yukawa coupling matrices : @xmath24 where the higgs fields are replaced by their vevs in planck units .",
    ".best fit to experimental data .",
    "all masses are running masses at 1 gev except the top quark mass which is the pole mass . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the diagonal elements in all 3 yukawa matrices have the same form , up to complex conjugation , giving the order of magnitude su(5)-like results @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but the off - diagonal elements dominate @xmath20 making @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively larger .",
    "the diagonal and off - diagonal contributions to the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath21 are approximately equal , giving @xmath29 .",
    "a three parameter order of magnitude fit @xcite , including random complex factors of order unity , with @xmath30 fixed , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 successfully reproduces the 9 masses and 3 mixing angles  see table [ bestfit ] .",
    "we now apply our principle of degenerate vacua and the strongly first order phase transition requirement to the pure sm , with a desert up to the planck scale @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that , with loop corrections , the sm effective higgs potential can have two minima .",
    "so we are led to our two crucial assumptions : a ) the two minima in the standard model effective higgs potential are degenerate : @xmath34 .",
    "b ) the second minimum has a higgs field squared of the order of unity in planck units : @xmath35 gev)@xmath36 .",
    "we use the renormalisation group improved tree level effective potential , identifying the renormalisation point with the field strength @xmath37 : @xmath38 , where one of the minima corresponds to our vacuum with @xmath39 gev , defines ( part of ) the well - known vacuum stability curve in the @xmath40 plane , for @xmath41 . for values of @xmath37 of order",
    "@xmath9 , the @xmath42 term dominates the @xmath43 term and the vacuum degeneracy condition requires @xmath44 to vanish .",
    "also the derivative of @xmath45 should be zero : @xmath46 and thus the beta function @xmath47 vanishes as well .",
    "so we impose the conditions @xmath48 near the planck scale and , using the renormalisation group equations , determine a single point on the sm vacuum stability curve . in this way our two assumptions , illustrated in figure [ fig : veff ] , lead to our predictions for the top quark and higgs boson pole masses : @xmath49",
    "we have found a rather good fit , that in principle should only work to order of magnitude accuracy , for the nine charged quark and lepton masses and the three mixing angles ; it even fits the cp - violation reasonably well .",
    "three suppression factors were used , indentified in the model with expectation values of three higgs fields , t , w , and @xmath23 .",
    "there was also a higgs field @xmath50 causing no suppression",
    ". even the overall mass scale could be thought of as being correctly predicted , in as far as it is part of our model that unforbidden yukawa couplings are of order of magnitude unity and therefore the top quark mass corresponds to the electroweak scale . since",
    "our fit is a priori based on the assumption of the agut gauge group , @xmath3 , one may at first think that we could take the goodness of our fit as evidence for this gauge group really being realized at some very high energy scale  say the planck scale , to which we actually extrapolated in our detailed fit . however , first the field @xmath50 caused a breakdown of this group to the subgroup @xmath51 = @xmath52 .",
    "thus our model for the fermion masses really only used the quantum numbers of this subgroup and checked for its presence in the gauge group .",
    "secondly we did not have to use the non - abelian parts of the group , but obtained our results using just the u(1 ) factors .",
    "so concluding back to the relevance of the proposed agut group is somewhat doubtful .",
    "however , we also pointed out that our @xmath3 gauge group could be specified rather simply by means of four suggestive postulates .",
    "thus when this relatively easy to characterize group , @xmath53 turns out to provide a consistent mass matrix fit , it is rather suggestive after all that it is indeed the correct gauge group .",
    "an at first rather unrelated calculation gave us the top quark mass with good accuracy @xmath54 gev , and not only its order of magnitude as in the just mentioned agut fit .",
    "we required the weinberg - salam higgs potential of the pure standard model to have two degenerate minima , one being at the planck scale , as in figure [ fig : veff ] . from the same requirement ,",
    "the higgs mass is predicted to have that value which barely allows the stability of the sm vacuum : @xmath55 gev .",
    "the two calculations are actually connected , in as far as our fine structure constant predictions , described in don bennett s talk @xcite , are based on the assumptions underlying both calculations : the agut gauge group ( ignoring though the @xmath6 ) and the principle that there shall be degenerate vacua .    it should be stressed that the more precise top quark mass prediction was based on the assumption that there should be a desert almost up to the planck scale .",
    "so it would be a falsification of the simplest  and presumably the only sensible  version of our model , if new physics particles such as , for example , susy particles are found , which would give so strong contributions to the renormalisation group running for the top and higgs couplings that it would disturb our top quark mass prediction",
    ".    however , our order of magnitude fit to the quark and lepton spectrum is not very sensitive to the scale at which our proposed agut gauge group should be found .",
    "it is true that we extrapolate to the planck scale and thereby use the simple suppression factors to fit the planck scale yukawa couplings .",
    "this extrapolation essentially just provides each lepton mass with an extra factor 3 to 4 relative to the quark masses , because the lepton yukawa couplings are running less than the quark yukawas . but a factor 3 to 4 is not sensitively tested when we only work with orders of magnitude .",
