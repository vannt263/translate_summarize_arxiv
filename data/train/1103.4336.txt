    "recently , a quasielastic neutron scattering ( qens ) experiment on the fully hydrated phospholipid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine ( dmpc ) was published  @xcite .",
    "it corroborated collective flow - like motions as a novel view of the long - range motion of phospholipid molecules that had been put forward by molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "a fit to the data showed that the component which was assigned to the long - range flow - like motion of the molecules levelled off at temperatures below the main phase transition ( 24 ) and low values of @xmath1 as shown in .",
    "this was discussed to be a sign of a confinement of the molecules during the 60ps observation time in a cage of their neighbours  or an artifact  @xcite .    the macroscopic diffusion of phospholipid molecules is known to decrease by about one order of magnitude when the membrane is cooled below the main phase transition  @xcite . in contrast , the high-@xmath1 part of the broadening caused by the long - range motion shown in decreases much less . the confinement length that was extracted from the position of the deviation of the linear behaviour at low @xmath1 to about 9 coincides quite well with the molecular repeating distance in the membrane .",
    "this made a flow - like motion of the single molecules until they hit the cage of the neighbouring molecules seem reasonable .",
    "however , it was speculated already there that this might be an artifact as the broadening is very small compared to the instrumental resolution .",
    "a caging effect should also not only cause a plateau of the quasielastic broadening but simultaneously an emerging elastic @xmath2 component which was not observed . on a physical level , it is not clear why the flow - like , collective motions of the molecules together with their caging neighbours above the phase transition should persist at low temperatures for the single molecules within the cages .",
    "the present contribution aims to clarify the picture of the motions of phospholipid molecules on a 60ps time scale below the main phase transition .",
    "the two likely artifacts that could simulate the observed plateau of the broadening at low @xmath1 are studied : multiple scattering and fit artifacts .",
    "only two years after the collection of the first neutron diffraction patterns ever in 1946  @xcite , multiple scattering was identified as the source of a spurious background contribution  @xcite .",
    "a few years later , efforts to treat multiple scattering ( semi-)analytically were started  @xcite and later complemented by monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , still by far most quasielastic neutron scattering experiments study samples with very high transmission in order to be able to neglect rather than correct multiple scattering .",
    "the transmission needed to justify this neglect is not agreed on in the literature ",
    "some authors feel safe with samples with a transmission of 99%  @xcite , most adjust their samples to achieve a transmission of about 90%  @xcite but others still feel comfortable with samples with a transmission as low as 70%  @xcite .",
    "it is also often unclear what to expect from uncorrected multiple scattering .",
    "an artificial broadening due to multiple scattering was for example assumed to yield a diffusion coefficient that was higher  @xcite than the generally accepted value  @xcite .",
    "others suggested that this broadening results in a @xmath1 dependence of the line width as shown in which is normally interpreted as confined diffusion  @xcite .",
    "offsets of the line width and the elastic incoherent structure factor ( eisf ) are also often observed  @xcite some of which were shown to be due to multiple scattering .    whereas the neutron scattering community is well aware of the problem of multiple scattering ,",
    "fitting artifacts are widely ignored which can lead to erroneous results : one crucial step is the numerical convolution of the theoretical fit function with the measured instrumental resolution  @xcite .",
    "the instrumental resolution gets more important as neutron spectroscopy is employed for the study of very slow motions because the line broadening caused by the sample gets small .",
    "it is even sometimes said that the instrumental resolution should be seen as a lower limit for the detectable broadening . however , while this is a valid rule of thumb for localised motions , many measurements of long - range motions which cause a broadening of the whole line are done below this limit : from neutron scattering studies of diffusion in water  @xcite over proteins  @xcite to metallic liquids  @xcite or x - ray scattering studies of glass formers  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "a short repetition of the basic assumptions of neutron scattering data evaluation is presented , highlighting the points where multiple scattering and fit artifacts come into play . after a description of the studied systems ,",
    "the effects of multiple scattering and the point density used for the fit are described generally enough to be useful also for other experiments .",
    "the consequences for the evaluation of long - range and localized motions are presented and with this knowledge , a coherent picture for the phospholipid dynamics is proposed .",
    "the evaluation of qens data relies vitally on the fact that the recorded number of neutrons as a function of solid angle and energy transfer , the double differential cross section , can be transformed into the scattering functions @xmath3 via  @xcite @xmath4 in this relation , it is assumed that a monochromatic beam of neutrons was scattered at most once in the sample and that the scattering lengths of the atoms do not correlate with their positions .",
    "it is often further simplified by neglecting the coherent scattering contributions of hydrogen - rich samples and using only the absolute value of the scattering vector , @xmath1 , for powder samples .    to account for the non - perfect monochromaticity of the incident neutron beam and the finite energy resolution of the spectrometer",
    ", the experimentally obtained scattering function @xmath5 is understood as the convolution of the instrumental resolution function @xmath6 with the theoretical scattering function @xmath7 : @xmath8 for the analysis of qens data , this convolution is carried out only in the energy - direction . as the real resolution of the spectrometer does not strictly follow an analytical function , the integral form of this convolution @xmath9 is mostly replaced by the discrete equivalent @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total number of points of a spectrum in the energy direction and @xmath12 the width of a bin .",
    "the relevant motions of the scatterers are then assumed to be independent of each other so that the scattering function can be approximated as a composition of e.g.  translational , rotational , and vibrational contributions  @xcite , @xmath13    the amount of physics _ and approximations _ contained in these equations is so overwhelming that it seems safe to postulate that by far most neutron scatterers ( including the authors ) settle for using these approximations after following the calculations a few times .    in this contribution",
    ", we discuss the influence of two of these steps : ( a )  the assumption that all detected neutrons were scattered only once in the sample and ( b )  the correction of the limited instrumental resolution by the discrete convolution of the theoretical scattering function with an experimentally obtained instrumental resolution function .",
    "a vanadium hollow cylinder standard with an outer radius 11.75 mm and wall thickness 0.6 mm was measured at 20 .",

    "the algorithm of paalman and pings  @xcite was used to calculate the path lengths of the neutrons through the samples as a function of the scattering angle . using the average scattering cross section , the probabilities for them to be scattered",
    "was determined from this length  @xcite .",
    "only those neutrons which were scattered exactly once were considered to be detected . to facilitate comparability with the measured data ,",
    "the resulting differential scattering cross sections were scaled with a factor that was chosen such that the calculated integral scattering cross section in the covered angular range is equal to the measured one for the 0.1 mm sample , cf .  a.    the energy - integrated scattering cross section , the diffraction pattern one would measure at a standard diffraction instrument , is shown in b. several differences to the calculated one are visible : ( a )  the scattered amount of neutrons is much higher than expected from the calculation because double scattered neutrons are actually not lost .",
    "( b )  increasing the thickness of the water layer generally also increases the scattered intensity .",
    "this increase is however very small for the thick samples  the 3.0 mm sample scatters hardly more , at small scattering angles even less , than the 2.0 mm sample .",
    "( c )  the angular variation of the scattered intensity is lower than expected from the calculation .",
    "the elastically scattered intensity determined by integration of an energy range of @xmath42ev is shown in c. it can easily be seen that the amount of elastically scattered neutrons does not scale linearly with the amount of sample  the thickest sample even scatters less neutrons elastically than the thinnest at low angles .          comparing the scattering function @xmath5 of the thinnest and the thickest sample in a ,",
    "it becomes clear that the elastic signal of the 3.0 mm measurement depends much less on @xmath1 than the one of the 0.1 mm measurement , in agreement with c. at higher energy transfers , the 3.0 mm sample has up to one order of magnitude more signal than the 0.1 mm measurement .",
    "this artificial gain in intensity distorts the dynamical susceptibility even more than the scattering function .    to look closer at the redistribution of the scattered intensity in the quasielastic region , the double differential scattering cross section of the 3.0 mm measurement and",
    "the one of the 0.1 mm measurement were independently normalized to the same total scattering cross section in the dynamical range .",
    "the data of the 3.0 mm measurement were then divided by the ones of the 0.1 mm measurement .",
    "the result is shown as a function of energy transfer and scattering angle in b as well as a function of energy transfer and @xmath1 in c. values smaller than @xmath44 designate areas where multiple scattering caused a loss of intensity , values bigger than @xmath44 those where additional , multiply scattered neutrons were detected .",
    "the pattern shows a slight asymmetry with respect to the energy transfer .",
    "the lower intensity observed on the neutron energy loss side was attributed to the higher absorption probability for slower neutrons .    at low scattering angles ,",
    "the signal of the 0.1 mm measurement decreases more rapidly as a function of energy transfer than the signal of the 3.0 mm measurement which is more smeared out , cf .",
    "a. this leads to the high relative intensity at low scattering angles and large energy transfers . with increasing scattering angle ,",
    "the shapes of the scattering functions become more similar to each other .          in the fit with two lorentzians  ,",
    "the properties of the narrow and the broad one , corresponding to long - range and localized motions , respectively , are discussed in the following .",
    "the arguably most important observation in the presented measurements is shown in a and b : the line width of the narrow lorentzian is largely unaffected by multiple scattering .",
    "this means that a reliable determination of the diffusion coefficient is possible even when a massive amount of multiple scattering is present .",
    "this will be detailed in the discussion .",
    "the intensity distribution between the two lorentzians , the eisf , follows for the thin samples quite well the expected gaussian - like decrease with @xmath1 , see c. however , it is already visible in the 0.1 mm measurement that the eisf does not extrapolate to 1 as @xmath1 approaches 0 .",
    "this well - known sign of multiple scattering @xcite gets much stronger with increasing sample layer thickness .",
    "the width of the broad lorentzian is shown in d. an overall trend to larger widths with increasing @xmath1 is visible on top of which a thicker sample size increases the width rather independently of @xmath1 . as can be seen in a , the data are at large energy transfers even flatter than the fit .",
    "this means that multiple scattering causes a very broad , background - like contribution .",
    "the intermediate scattering function can be fitted well with a stretched exponential as can be seen in a.    the prefactor , displayed in b , is basically the value @xmath45 , i.e.  the zeroth fourier component , which is the area under the scattering function , @xmath46 .",
    "the limits of the integration are given by the region where the scattering function was evaluated  which in turn is limited by the dynamical range of the experiment .",
    "the mean relaxation time is influenced by multiple scattering , both in its average value and its @xmath1 dependence .",
    "the strongest effect can be observed in c at intermediate @xmath1 ( around 0.7@xmath17 ) where the apparent speed - up is most pronounced , in agreement with monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "the stretching factor is more influenced than the mean relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "stretching increases ( @xmath41 decreases ) systematically , most at small values of @xmath1 , cf .",
    "d.          the width of the narrow component of the fit to the phospholipid data with a binning of @xmath0ev is shown in .",
    "the analogous fit to the data with @xmath47ev yields the line widths in a. also shown are in both figures fits of straight lines to the medium @xmath1 range data points and the width of the bins .",
    "it can be seen that in the case of the coarse energy binning shown in , the data points deviate strongly from the linear behaviour at low @xmath1 and level off to a value of about @xmath48 . with a finer energy binning ,",
    "a , they display a much more linear behaviour .",
    "this is shown in detail in b where the fit results for the two energy binnings are compared . the effect is striking : the levelling off which was discussed to be either confinement or a fit artifact  @xcite is clearly the latter .",
    "both , geometry and rate of the long - range motion are surprisingly little affected by multiple scattering . the rate of the diffusion is connected to the overall value of @xmath49 or @xmath50 , the geometry to the @xmath1-dependence of these quantities .",
    "the evaluation of the scattering function @xmath51 with the sum of two lorentzians where the narrow accounts for the long - range motion yields very robust parameters for the narrow component .",
    "as can be seen in b , only for small @xmath1 , an increasing scattering power of the sample correlates with an increase of the line width .    of the large deviation of the measured line width from the expected values for low @xmath1 shown in , up to 125%",
    ", only a very small part can be attributed to multiple scattering : extrapolating the 72% and 85% transmission measurements to one with 100% transmission , we expect a deviation at small @xmath1 of about 3% .",
    "this extrapolation is known to be not suitable for the precise evaluation of multiple scattering  @xcite but it shows that the effects caused by multiple scattering are more than one order of magnitude lower than the observed deviations in .",
    "much in contrast , the fitting artifacts distort the observed geometry of the long - range motion heavily . it will be shown in the following that a systematically too large line broadening ( or too small correlation time ) is obtained .",
    "a lorentzian line is practically indistinguishable from a power law for any @xmath52 , namely @xmath53 , as shown in .",
    "this means that for any energy transfer bigger than @xmath39 , the fit can be shifted to bigger @xmath54-values either by increasing the always present prefactor @xmath28 or ",
    "completely equivalently  by increasing @xmath39 .    increasing @xmath28 or increasing @xmath39 makes a difference only at energy transfers smaller than @xmath39 : increasing @xmath28 increases the @xmath54-values in this range whereas increasing @xmath39 decreases them .",
    "it is therefore this range which determines @xmath28 and @xmath39 .",
    "the discrete convolution of the theoretical fit function @xmath7 with the instrumental resolution @xmath6 is the origin of this problem : whereas @xmath55 is in the present case very well - behaved , @xmath56 becomes so sharp peaked as @xmath39 decreases that the evaluated values at the points near zero energy transfer are not representative for the whole bin any more .",
    "this is because the curvature in the center of the lorentzian is @xmath57 and diverges therefore for @xmath58 .",
    "the consequence is that the integral convolution in   can not be substituted by the discrete convolution   any more : whereas the integral under the lorentzian is @xmath39-independently unity , the riemann sum deviates very strongly when the line width is smaller than about half of the distance between two evaluated points , @xmath59 .",
    "it will be shown in the following that the systematically too large fit value for the line width does not depend on the direction of this deviation in the critical cases discussed here ( @xmath60ev , @xmath0ev ) :    ( a )  if the sum is calculated too big ( the center of the lorentzian is close to a measured point ) , the central points are mistakenly calculated too high .",
    "only the central point which is evaluated at the center of the lorentzian is in the plateau region of the lorentzian .",
    "( a.1 )  the fit can increase @xmath39 and hereby lower the central points by both , the natural decrease ( a ) and the better calculation ( b ) .",
    "simultaneously , the function values in the wings of the lorentzian will increase ( a ) which will be compensated by a smaller value for the prefactor @xmath28 , making only a small counter - contribution to lower the central points .",
    "( a.2 )  the fit could alternatively decrease the prefactor to get the central points down .",
    "this leads to a fit curve that is systematically below the data points at large energy transfers  it will be shifted upwards by increasing @xmath39 .",
    "( b )  if the sum is calculated too small ( the center of the lorentzian is close to the middle in between two measured points ) , the central points are mistakenly calculated too low .",
    "the points which are evaluated close to the center of the lorentzian are already in the power law wing region of the lorentzian .",
    "( b.1 )  the fit can increase @xmath39 and hereby increase the central points by both , the natural increase ( a ) and the better calculation ( b ) . simultaneously , the function values in the wings of the lorentzian will increase ( a ) which will be compensated by a smaller value for the prefactor @xmath28 which can not compensate the increase caused by the better calculation though .",
    "( b.2 )  the fit could alternatively increase the prefactor to get the central points up .",
    "this leads to a fit curve that is systematically above the data points at large energy transfers  it would need to be shifted downwards by decreasing @xmath39 .",
    "however , this would yield even lower central points ( b ) and is therefore not an option for the fit .    in conclusion",
    ", the fit will _ always _ yield a line width @xmath39 that is too broad if @xmath61 . in the example of the phospholipid measurements shown in and ,",
    "the deviation from a linear behaviour at small @xmath1 is decreased from 125% ( in ) to about 30% ( in ) by choosing a smaller energy step between measured points .",
    "this 30% deviation might very well be due to the background in the resolution measurement , caused by the instrument and phonons in the vanadium . comparing the fits using a convolution with the instrumental resolution as determined by a vanadium measurement at temperatures between 4k and 300k as well as gaussians with flat background , the fitted values differed in this order of magnitude without showing clear trends .",
    "this will be studied in more detail and presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the evaluation of the localized motions in the two - component fit of the scattering function is influenced in both , rate and geometry .",
    "this is because the multiply scattered neutrons obtain relatively large energy transfers , yielding a nearly flat background in the energy direction . with an increasing amount of multiple scattering ,",
    "this background increases .",
    "the broad lorentzian which accounts for localized motions therefore broadens and gets more intensity .",
    "the geometry is increasingly hard to evaluate from the eisf as it does not approach 1 for small momentum transfers any more .",
    "it seems to be the most sensitive indicator for multiple scattering . including an arbitrary scaling factor in the definition of the eisf",
    "as done previously  @xcite makes an approximate evaluation possible at reasonable transmissions  @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will try to explain the effects of multiple scattering with simple phase space arguments , assuming for the calculation of @xmath1 that the neutron does not change its energy in a scattering process and neglecting the geometry of the sample  @xcite .",
    "knowing that the spectrum of multiply scattered neutrons is essentially a convolution of the double differential cross section with itself for every scattering process  @xcite and that two times scattering is the most probable multiple scattering event  @xcite , the @xmath1 values of the two scattering events are the interesting quantities .",
    "the width of the observed scattering function will then be approximatively the sum of the two single scattering processes .",
    "using monte carlo simulations  @xcite , it was determined that the probability distribution of the scattering angles of the single scattering processes is  independently of the total scattering angle  nearly triangular with a maximum probability of 90 , corresponding to a @xmath1 of already 0.71@xmath62 ( elastic ) , in this case to 1.5@xmath17 .",
    "a similar assessment has also been used elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "half of the neutrons will be scattered with a larger @xmath1 and result in a very broad line contributed by the multiply scattered neutrons .",
    "the upper limit for the values of @xmath1 that can possibly participate in a double scattering event is given by the wavelength of the neutrons : @xmath63 .",
    "the lower limit for @xmath64 seen from a given @xmath65 can be deduced from a where the vectorial momentum transfer of the first scattering process is denoted with @xmath66 , the one of the second with @xmath67 , and the total ( observed ) by @xmath68 .",
    "this means for the absolute values : @xmath69 .",
    "the distribution of possible @xmath1 values in the scattering process and therefore of relaxation times is therefore largest at small @xmath65 ( cf .",
    "the shift with regards to the scattering angle and the cut - off of @xmath1 by the choice of the wavelength of the incoming neutrons brings about that a change of this wavelength influences multiple scattering not only for coherently scattering samples  @xcite but also for incoherently scattering samples  @xcite , although to a smaller extent .    to understand the resulting line width , one needs the conditional probability for the two scattering events given some @xmath65 .",
    "we have calculated the mean @xmath70 after a given @xmath71 as follows ( cf .",
    "a ) : the probability for a certain ( @xmath72)-combination is directly proportional to the number of allowed ( @xmath73)-combinations , weighed with the corresponding solid angles .    the probability to have an event with a certain @xmath74 is inversely proportional to the surface of a sphere with radius @xmath64 , @xmath75 . multiplying these two probabilities",

    "the result , symmetrical in @xmath71 and @xmath70 , is displayed in b. it can be seen that even if one scattering process has already @xmath82 , the other scattering process still has a nonzero @xmath70 .",
    "two limiting behaviours can be observed : on the one hand , for @xmath71 and @xmath83@xmath17 , the mean @xmath70 depends basically only on @xmath84 and is never less than about 1.0@xmath17 . on the other hand , for @xmath71 and @xmath85@xmath17",
    ", we observe @xmath86 .",
    "scattering events where the second scattering process has a very small @xmath1 compared to @xmath71 and @xmath65 , i.e.  broadening the signal only slightly , are very rare .",
    "this causes the distinctness between the signal and the much broader contribution of multiply scattered neutrons .",
    "it is clear that the long - range motion extracted from a measurement with an observation time of 60ps is not the macroscopic long - range motion .",
    "this manifests for example in a higher velocity  @xcite and lower influence of additives  @xcite than observed macroscopically .",
    "although the molecule travelled only a distance of about 1  @xcite during this short time , the interactions with the neighbours , the cage , are already established .",
    "the observed flow - like motion is not the initial phase of free flight before the molecule experiences the presence of the surrounding neighbours .",
    "this is evidenced by both , the clear existence of localized ( caged ) motions and the small flow velocity which is nearly three orders of magnitude below the thermal expectation value  @xcite .",
    "as shown in the present contribution , the neutron scattering data show no significant evidence for a restriction of the flow - like long - range motion to a cage within the observation time  above and below the main phase transition .",
    "we explain this with `` floppy modes '' : the molecules are pushed around by density fluctuations resembling longitudinal acoustic phonons in crystals . below the phase transition , a restoring force will eventually push them back to the original place . due to the `` floppiness '' of the material , the molecules travel more than the 1 during which the experiment follows them before the restoring force gets big enough to restrict their motion .",
    "therefore , this effect does not leave a trace in the data . above the phase transition ,",
    "the molecules are transported by many short subsequent uncorrelated flow events .",
    "these low - frequency `` floppy modes '' are known from disordered colloidal crystals  @xcite , colloidal glass formers , and supercooled liquids and signal the onset of macroscopic elasticity  @xcite .",
    "phospholipid membranes also exhibit elasticity above and below the main phase transition  @xcite and the observed flow patterns  @xcite resemble very much dynamical heterogeneities  @xcite , a hallmark of glassy dynamics , which were again suggested to be linked with the `` floppy modes ''  @xcite .",
    "the reason that the dynamics of phospholipids resembles so much dense , supercooled systems is probably the very high density in the head group area of the phospholipids  @xcite .",
    "this similarity has proven to be extremely useful already in the past when the free volume theory developed for glasses  @xcite was adapted to membranes  @xcite .",
    "transposing the newer concepts developed in glass physics , dynamical heterogeneities and `` floppy modes '' , to phospholipid membranes seems not only consequent but can also explain the observed features effortless .",
    "the molecular motion of the phospholipid dmpc was studied below and above the main phase transition on a time scale of about 60ps , taking the influence of multiple scattering and fit artifacts into particular consideration .",
    "multiple scattering was shown to be only a minor nuisance for the determination of the long - range motion of an incoherent scatterer .",
    "exemplary , h@xmath14o samples with transmissions between 85% and as low as 2% were studied .",
    "the multiply scattered neutrons are lost in the elastic region of the signal and create a background which is a very broad line in energy space . in a multicomponent analysis , they affect therefore only the evaluation of localized motions .",
    "this , together with the excellent agreement of the results with monte carlo simulations shows that one could more often dare to use strongly scattering samples for quasielastic measurements .",
    "the fit of a theoretical scattering function to measured data after numerical convolution with a measured resolution function can give erroneous results .",
    "a delicate combination of correlated fitting parameters and a discretization problem during the convolution with the measured instrumental resolution causes an error in an unexpected place : the line width . analyzing the data with different bin widths should give indications if this problem is present .",
    "the lower limit for the bin width is often given by the online histogramming of the neutrons during the experiment  a complete event recording of the detected neutrons , in principle possible , would remove this limitation .    flow - like motions of the phospholipid molecules bear a striking resemblance to dynamical heterogeneities above the main phase transition and to `` floppy modes '' below .",
    "the confinement of the molecules below the main phase transition is not visible in the long - range component of the fit due to the short observation time of the experiment .",
    "it seems that the description of motions in the phospholipid membrane could much profit from transferring the up - to - date concepts used in glass physics .",
