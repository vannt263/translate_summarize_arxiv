    "[ f2 ] shows that the two last b - normal like aspects lasted 4 to 5 years . from the last two cycles we learn that after the quiescent , or b - normal like phases , the star resumes its maximum emission in no more than 2 years .",
    "we can also see that after each emission maxima there is a 4 - 5 year lasting plateau of weak emission before the star recovers the b - normal like aspect .",
    "these time scales may have some significance to model the ce formation in this star .",
    "if the evolution of the ce in @xmath0  eri , i.e. formation and subsequent dissipation , has to be understood in terms of a viscous decretion disc model ( porter 1999 , okazaki 2001 ) , from the expected average viscous time scales for @xmath23 days ( clark et al . 2003 ) , we would derive two quite different series of values for the viscosity coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "the time scales implied by the ce formation , estimated from the time that takes the emission rise in the h@xmath0 line : 2 years roughly , we would obtain @xmath24 0.08 , which is of the same order as expected for ce envelopes studied by blondin & negueruela ( 2001 ) , matsumo ( 1999 ) and clark et al .",
    "the time required by the decrease from maximum to zero is either 10 years in the 1974 - 1989 cycle or 6 years during the 1991 - 2000 cycle .",
    "this imply @xmath25 , which is about 4 times smaller than implied in the formation process .",
    "we may then wonder whether the bulk redistribution of material in the circumstellar disc occurs only as a consequence of a viscous redistribution of angular momentum ."
