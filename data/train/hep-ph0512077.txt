    "therefore it is of interest to consider other production mechanisms for @xmath0 which may allow observable rates if the @xmath1 coupling is suppressed . since the couplings @xmath1 and @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is another higgs boson in the model ) are complementary , two lep collaborations , _",

    "these cuts are very effective against the backgrounds from continuous @xmath264 production which occur mainly through photon and gluon bremsstrahlung emission from initial and/or final state quarks , and gluon splitting to collinear quarks .",

    "we can also learn that the @xmath269 distribution becomes harder as the charged higgs mass increases .",

    "the rapidity distribution of the photons stemming from the fermiophobic higgs decay peaks around zero .",
    "however , there is a sizeable contribution from high rapidity photons . for",
    "heavier charged higgs bosons the rapidity distribution is more central .",
    "the hardest cut that we applied is the requirement that the absolute value of the photon rapidity be smaller than unity , and its effect is rather insensitive to the neutral higgs mass . on the other hand , the separation cuts in eq .",

    "statistical significance @xmath52 is defined by @xmath279 , where @xmath280 is the number of signal ( background ) events after applying cuts and efficiency factors .",
    "a few comments are in order .",

    "( [ eq : set1 ] ) as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ dist_etx ] .",
    "secondly , the shape of the region presenting at least 3@xmath52 ( 5@xmath52 or 10@xmath52 ) significance in the large @xmath0 mass region is the result of a competition between the phase space suppression of the cross section as @xmath248 increases for fixed @xmath18 and the growth of the @xmath281 branching ratio ; see fig .",
    "furthermore , for a fixed number of events , the optimum reach in @xmath248 takes place for @xmath282@xmath283 gev .",
    "this is a consequence of the combined effects of cuts and phase space suppression as we have already discussed .",

    "[ fig : cont1 ] , even in the low @xmath100 region the reach of the tevatron run ii is quite impressive in this scenario .",
    "if no events were observed above the backgrounds at run ii , a large fraction of the @xmath278 plane would be excluded at the 3@xmath52 level .",

    "[ fig : cont1 ] .",
    "importantly , the expected number of events is rather large in the region @xmath285 gev and @xmath286 gev , such that it will be possible to reconstruct the @xmath0 mass from the photon  photon invariant mass distribution ; see fig .",

    "[ fig : cont2 ] the expected signal significance of events containing three or more photons after cuts for the htm . in our numerical analysis",
    "we take @xmath287 as a benchmark value , and the signal significance for other values of @xmath288 can be obtained by simply rescaling the displayed numbers . from the bound @xmath289 one obtains @xmath290 . in the exact @xmath287 limit ( i.e. triplet vev @xmath291 )",
    "the neutrinos would not receive a mass at tree - level ( see eq .",
    "[ neutmass ] ) .",
    "extremely small @xmath292 would require non - perturbative values of @xmath128 to generate realistic neutrino masses .",
    "we are interested in the interval @xmath293 ( corresponding to gev scale triplet vev ) in which @xmath144 decays primarily to photons in the detector , and neutrino mass is generated with a very small @xmath294 .",
    "it is clear that a larger region of the @xmath51 parameter space can be probed in the htm than in the 2hdm .",
    "in fact , at the 3@xmath52 level run ii will be able to exclude higgs masses up to @xmath295 gev or @xmath54 gev . in order to understand the signal suppression if one requires an inclusive state containing four photons to pass our cuts , we present in fig .",
