    "when implementing any quantum information protocol , the states we wish to employ and manipulate are inevitably affected by decoherence effects , which diminish their purity and consequently their resource power . there",
    "exist several well - established methods to protect against such undesirable factors : strengthening the entanglement resource using distillation methods @xcite or employing a quantum error correction scheme @xcite to encode our ` fragile ' states into some larger , more unyielding system .",
    "the method we study in this paper is that of state _ purification _",
    "@xcite , a procedure which takes as input an ensemble of identical copies of an arbitrary ( unknown ) state and produces as output a smaller ensemble of identical states with higher purity .",
    "this can be seen as a special case of the more general problem of inverting the effect of a noisy channel on ensembles of states , the channel being the depolarising one in the present study .",
    "there already exists several theoretical results for purification of @xmath0 i.i.d .",
    "( independently and identically distributed ) mixed qubits , notably refs .",
    "@xcite , where optimal purification algorithms for various formulations of the purification problem are provided .",
    "purification of an ensemble of mixed qubit states has also been found to occur in the context of ` superbroadcasting ' @xcite , an @xmath1 cloning procedure which can actually result in purified clones for @xmath2 and sufficiently mixed input states ( the noise present is merely shifted from local states into correlations between output states ) . for @xmath3 , superbroadcasting is actually equivalent to the optimal purification procedure of @xcite .",
    "experimentally , purification has been achieved in @xcite , which implemented the methodology of @xcite and demonstrated optimal purification for the case @xmath4 .    beyond the _ entanglementology _ ( phenomenology of entanglement ) , judging the performance of a purification protocol",
    "requires a figure of merit ( fom ) which measures the departure from the ideal transformation .",
    "two types of fom have been considered in the literature , with very different results .",
    "local _ fom is built upon the comparison of the _ reduced _ states of individual output systems with the target state . in this case , a complete reversal of the depolarising channel may be obtained asymptotically with the size of the input ensemble , and with arbitrarily high output rate @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "global _ fom compares the _ joint _ state of the output with that of a product of independent target states .",
    "this is a more demanding criterion .",
    "for example if the output systems are independent and identically prepared then the global fidelity scales as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fidelity of an individual output state with respect to the target state .",
    "indeed , it has been shown @xcite that no protocol can achieve asymptotic purification @xmath8 to _ pure _ target states at a finite rate @xmath5 . the global figure or",
    "merit is relevant whenever we deal with the collective state of the output rather than the individual constituents , as in the case of state transfer between atomic ensembles and light .",
    "additionally , it can serve as a `` measure of correlations '' when the individual constituents of the output states are known to be exactly in the target state , as in superbroadcasting .",
    "this hypothesis will however not be pursued in this paper .",
    "the above no - go theorem motivates us to consider the question whether the depolarising channel can be reversed with a positive asymptotic output rate , when the target states ( i.e. the states prior to applying the depolarising channel ) are _",
    "mixed_. we show that this is indeed possible , and compute the maximal purification rate for given input and target purity , and the optimal fom for approximate purification at a fixed rate which is higher than the maximal one .",
    "we also consider the opposite process of _ dilution _ in which , starting from an ensemble of @xmath0 identically prepared states , we produce a _ larger _",
    "ensemble consisting of @xmath9 independent , but more mixed states .",
    "dilution shares similarities with the process of optimal @xmath1 quantum cloning @xcite , but while in cloning the rate @xmath5 is fixed , and one aims at generating clones as close as possible to the input states ( with respect to a local or a global fom ) , in a dilution procedure we set a target level of output purity and look for the optimal rate for generating such target states .

    "the key mathematical tool is that of local asymptotic normality ( lan ) , a fundamental ` classical ' statistics technique @xcite which was recently extended to the context of quantum statistical models @xcite . in the quantum case",

    "quantum systems into the simpler setting of gaussian states .",
    "the optimal solution for the corresponding gaussian problems can then be used to construct asymptotically optimal procedures for the original one . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we sketch how this could be physically implemented , and more details can be found in @xcite .    following this methodology",
    ", we transform the qubit purification and dilation problems into those of optimal _ attenuation _ and _ amplification _ for a one - mode cv system in a gaussian state , together with a classical real - valued gaussian variable , both with known variance but unknown means . in attenuation",
    "we reduce the variance of a displaced gaussian state , at the price of simultaneously reducing its amplitude , while in amplification we increase the amplitude , as well as the variance .",
    "for both problems we use a fom based on maximum trace - norm distance , and show that the optimal attenuation channel is obtained by applying a beamsplitter , while the optimal amplification is implemented by a non - degenerate parametric amplifier .",
    "a similar scheme for the attenuation of gaussian cv states has been proposed and experimentally implemented in @xcite .",
    "parametric amplification has been investigated in @xcite , and demonstrated experimentally in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the same amplifier is optimal for a fom based on the minimum amount of added noise @xcite .",
    "however , whilst these transformations are well known candidates for our protocols , to the best of our knowledge a proof of their optimality with respect to the fom chosen in this paper had not been obtained in the literature .",
    "our proof relies on a covariant channels optimisation technique developed in @xcite .",
    "we find that for given input and output purity parameters , there exists a range of values for the ratio @xmath10 between output and input displacement , such that attenuation or amplification can be realised perfectly , and we compute the maximal ( optimal ) value @xmath11 , as a function the two purities . in the parameter range",

    "the solutions of both classical and quantum versions of this problem rely on the notion of ` covariance ' .",

    "we will show that ( up to a trivial adjustment for a certain range of @xmath10 s ) the optimal solutions to the attenuation and amplification problems are , respectively , the beamsplitter and parametric amplifier .",
    "+    we start by defining a specific channel denoted in both cases @xmath63 , then show that it is optimal and compute the minimax risk . for @xmath54 and @xmath56 , the attenuation channel is implemented by the action of a beamsplitter with reflectivity @xmath10 acting on an input mode @xmath44 prepared in a state @xmath58 , and a second ancillary mode @xmath64 in the vacuum state @xmath65 .",

    "note also that the risk at a fixed point @xmath99 can always be made equal to zero by simply preparing the target state for that point . to take into account the _ overall _ performance of a procedure",
    ", one can either integrate the risk with respect to a prior distribution over states ( bayesian statistics ) or take the maximum over all states ( frequentist statistics ) .",
    "we adopt the latter viewpoint , and in addition we will consider a more refined version of the maximum risk called _ local maximum risk _ around @xmath103 @xmath104 in asymptotic statistics the local maximum risk is more informative that the ` global ' one since it captures the behaviour of the procedure around any point in the parameter space , rather than that of the worst case .",
    "the radius of the ball over which we maximise is slightly larger than the precision of @xmath105 with which we can estimate the state parameters , so that the definition of the local risk does not amount to assuming any prior information about the parameter .",

    "the corresponding operations of attenuation and amplification may then be carried out in the field in the optimal way .    in our case",
    "we need to consider mixed qubit states , which means that the collective state has non - zero components in all irreducible representations of su(2 ) ( all values of the total spin ) .",

    ". a typical block state of definite total spin can be mapped isometrically into the fock space of a one mode cv system , and converges to the quantum gaussian component of the limit model .",
    "this transfer can be implemented in principle by a creation - annihilation coupling with a bosonic field in which the state ` leaks' after a short time .",
    "the classical part ( total spin ) can be measured by coupling subsequently with another bosonic field , and performing an indirect measurement of @xmath143 in the field . since after the first step , all blocks are in the @xmath144 state , a measurement of @xmath143 is implicitly a measurement of the total spin .    the above convergence can be interpreted as follows : the quantum statistical models @xmath145 can be mapped into the gaussian model @xmath146 and vice - versa , by means of physical operations ( quantum channels ) with vanishing norm - one error . from the statistical point of view , in many situations this convergence is strong enough to allow us to map a statistical problem concerning the model @xmath145 to a similar one concerning the simpler model @xmath146 .    in the case of purification or dilution of qubits ,",

    "the risk is independent of @xmath40 and @xmath212 in the case of attenuation @xmath213 such channels are described by the linear transformation @xmath214 where @xmath44 is the input mode , @xmath215 is the output and @xmath64 is an ancillary mode prepared in a state @xmath216 .",
    "since the channel is completely characterised by the state @xmath216 , we will denote it by @xmath217 .",
    "similarly , for amplification @xmath57 the output of the channel @xmath217 is the mode @xmath218 with @xmath64 prepared in the state @xmath216 . by a second covariance argument with respect to phase rotations , and taking into account that @xmath219 is invariant under phase rotations , we obtain that @xmath216 can be taken to be phase - invariant , i.e. it is a mixture of fock states @xmath220 . in this case",
    "the output state will be diagonal in the fock basis and we write @xmath221 , and in particular @xmath222 corresponds to the output state when the ancilla is the vacuum .",
    "similarly , we denote the coefficients of the gaussian state @xmath223 and @xmath224 by @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "the proof reduces now to showing that , for any @xmath216 , @xmath227 the key to proving this statement is the concept of stochastic ordering , whose definition we recall :            _ attenuation .",
    "_ we write the input mode as @xmath236 with @xmath237 two fictitious modes in the vacuum state , and @xmath238 , which ensures that the state of @xmath44 is @xmath239 .",
    "let @xmath240 be such that @xmath241 and denote @xmath242 then @xmath243 can be written as @xmath244 where @xmath245 and @xmath246 was relabelled @xmath247 .",
    "the state of the mode @xmath248 is given by @xmath249 so @xmath248 is in the vacuum state if and only if @xmath64 is in the vacuum .",
    "thus it suffices to prove the stochastic ordering statement for the mode @xmath215 written as a combination of @xmath248 and @xmath247 for an arbitrary diagonal state @xmath250 of @xmath248 and @xmath247 in the vacuum .",
    "furthermore , since stochastic ordering is preserved under convex combinations , it suffices to prove the statement for any _ pure _ diagonal state @xmath251 , @xmath252 . in this case",
    "the state of @xmath215 is given by @xmath253 where @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "the stochastic ordering now reduces to showing that @xmath256 for all @xmath9 . with the notation @xmath257 , we get @xmath258    _ amplification . _ as before we write @xmath236 and define @xmath240 by @xmath259 and the beamsplitter coeficients @xmath260 the output mode is now @xmath261 where we have relabelled @xmath262 by @xmath247 and introduced the mode @xmath263 . as before , the state of @xmath248 is the vacuum if and only if @xmath64 is in the vacuum state , so it suffices to verify the statement for the state @xmath264 in which case the output state is @xmath265 the relation @xmath266 now follows from @xmath267 this ends the proof of lemma [ lemma42 ] for both cases .",
    "the following lemma completes the proof of theorem [ theorem21 ] by transforming the stochastic ordering into the desired norm inequality . its proof @xcite uses the fact that @xmath268 which is equivalent to the fact that @xmath269 is more noisy that @xmath270 .",
    "the latter is satisfied for @xmath78 as assumed in the theorem .",
    "we use the notations introduced in the proof of theorem  [ theorem21 ] . by expressing the quadrature variance of the input mode @xmath44 in terms of @xmath274 and @xmath87 we obtain @xmath275 . according to theorem [ theorem21 ] the output state of the optimal channel @xmath63",
    "is the gaussian state @xmath276 with @xmath277 taking different values in the attenuation and amplification cases . for the geometric distributions @xmath278 and @xmath232 we have @xmath279 where @xmath280 is the largest integer such that @xmath281 , more precisely @xmath282 /\\ln(s_{2}/\\tilde{s } ) \\rfloor\\ ] ] it remains to compute the concrete expressions of @xmath85 and implicitly of @xmath280 for the attenuation and amplification cases . for attenuation ,",
    "making use of @xmath283 , we find @xmath284 for amplification , we use @xmath285 and find @xmath286      we want to show that @xmath287 is the optimal purification or dilution procedure for @xmath0 i.i.d . qubits .",
    "the idea is that , by using lan , we can show the qubit and gaussian statistical problems to be equivalent , the gaussian one ( respectively for attenuation and amplification ) being solved in section  [ sec2b ] , which then allows us to recast the qubit problem in the gaussian setup with a vanishing difference in the risks .",
    "we will consider the four separate cases : zero risk , solely quantum contribution , solely classical contribution , and both classical and quantum contributions .",
    "we will then use the gaussian solution to show that @xmath288 is less than or equal to the corresponding optimal gaussian risk , then show that a strict inequality violates the optimality of this optimal solution .",
    "we begin by restricting @xmath99 to the local neighbourhood @xmath289 .",
    "this probability that the state fails to be in this region is @xmath290 and has no influence on the asymptotic risk ( see lemma 2.1 . in @xcite ) .",
    "we are now able to apply lan , which maps input states @xmath291 close to some gaussian state , say @xmath292 , via the channel @xmath139 .",
    "we now consider the individual cases , which are each slight variations on the same proof :      * case * @xmath197 : @xmath294 . in this instance",
    ", the risk receives only a quantum contribution . using contractivity of the cp maps @xmath295 and @xmath77 , the lan convergence , and the fact that in this regime @xmath296 we obtain @xmath297 where @xmath298 is the minimax risk for the quantum gaussian problem , obtained in theorem [ theorem21 ] . by taking supremum over @xmath299",
    "we get @xmath300 which implies that @xmath301    next , we show by contradiction that this inequality can not be strict .",
    "suppose that there exists a sequence of purification or dilution procedures @xmath302 , which act on qubits and satisfies @xmath303 for some @xmath304 and @xmath305 .",
    "we will use lan to show that there exists a gaussian dilution ( amplification ) channel whose risk is strictly smaller than the minimax risk , which is a contradiction .",
    "the general setup can be seen in ( [ ocd ] ) @xmath306 here lan is restricted to a _ two dimensional _ family of rotated qubit states , for which the limit model is quantum gaussian , with no classical component .",
    "assuming @xmath307 is in the domain of applicability of lan ( which can be effected by an adaptive measurement @xcite ) , we get the inequalities @xmath308 by taking the limit @xmath109 we get the desired contradiction .",
    "* case * @xmath200 : @xmath201 .",
    "this case applies only to dilution and the risk receives only a classical contribution .",
    "the proof follows the same steps as the previous case , with the quantum gaussian replaced by the classical one .",
    "the inequality becomes @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the optimal risk of eq .",
    "( [ clrisk ] ) and we have identified @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "this implies @xmath311 the equality is obtained by showing that strict inequality would lead to a classical amplification procedure whose risk is smaller than the minimax risk .",
    "* case * @xmath203 : @xmath312 .",
    "this case applies to both dilution and amplification , and both the quantum and classical channels contribute to the risk . @xmath313 here @xmath314 is the minimax norm - one risk for the problem of transforming the gaussian state @xmath315 into @xmath316 . since the quantum and classical components are independent and have different local parameters , the optimal channel is the product @xmath317 .",
    "the explicit expression of the minimax risk is @xmath318 finally , the equality in ( [ a9 ] ) can be proven by contradiction as in case 2 ."
