    "in the last decade or so numerous real - time studies of carrier relaxation dynamics in cuprate superconductors have been performed utilizing pump - probe techniques .",
    "the initial studies were aimed at the understanding of relaxation,@xcite and the interplay between the superconducting gap and the normal state pseudogap.@xcite recently , however , several reports explored the dependence on excitation intensity of depletion of superconducting state@xcite as well as of photoinduced structural dynamics@xcite and phase transitions.@xcite    it has been known since 1971 that an intense laser pulse can destroy the superconducting ( sc ) state non - thermally - the absorbed energy density is lower that the energy density required to heat up the sample to the critical temperature.@xcite the rapid development of stable amplified laser systems , producing optical pulses with sub 100 fs pulse duration has enabled studies of dynamics of sc suppression in real time.@xcite this technique enables direct measurement of the sc condensation energy , @xmath4 ( the difference in the free energy density between the sc and normal states at zero temperature ) . if , following photoexcitation with a fs optical pulse , the absorbed energy remains in the electronic subsystem during the process of sc state destruction , the absorbed ( optical ) energy density required to suppress sc , @xmath5 , should be equal to @xmath4 . in conventional superconductors @xmath4 can be directly determined by measuring the thermodynamic critical magnetic field , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "however , in high-@xmath8 cuprate superconductors the critical magnetic fields are very high and hardly accessible experimentally . to determine @xmath4 in cuprates , the t - dependence of the electronic specific heat @xmath9 has been studied.@xcite however , since @xmath9 is determined by measuring the total specific heat of the sc sample , and subtracting the phonon part ( obtained by measuring the specific heat of an impurity doped non - sc sample ) , it may be prone to some uncertainty .",
    "in a recent optical pump - probe ( opp ) study , an attempt was made to determine @xmath4 in single crystals of high temperature superconductor la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) by means of ultrafast optics.@xcite @xmath5 was found to be about one order of magnitude higher than the thermodynamically determined @xmath4.@xcite this large difference can hardly be attributed to the experimental uncertainties , so it was concluded that the major part of @xmath5 is transferred to the phonon subsystem on the sub - picosecond timescale.@xcite indeed , a recent optical - pump  thz probe ( optp ) study in optimally doped yba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath12  ( ybco),@xcite showed rapid heating of the two infrared - active c - axis phonon modes on the timescale of 150 fs.@xcite moreover , @xmath5 was also found to be about 10 times larger than @xmath4.@xcite similar studies on bi@xmath10sr@xmath10cacu@xmath10o@xmath13 ( bi2212 ) single crystals @xcite also indicate that @xmath14 .    here",
    "we report the results of study of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( x = 0.08 , 0.16 , 0.21 ) thin films using both opp and optp .",
    "in addition to the low - temperature measurements , the temperature dependence of @xmath5 was studied .",
    "we find that , within the experimental uncertainty , both opp and optp give an identical value of @xmath5 for lsco .",
    "this observation is of particular importance , since optp is probing the gap resonantly .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath5 is nearly identical to the one extracted from the opp studies on lsco single crystals.@xcite in addition , we find almost no temperature dependence of @xmath5 below @xmath8 .",
    "this observation , together with the fact that @xmath15 , strongly suggest that during the time when the sc state suppression takes place most of the absorbed energy is transferred to phonons with energy lower than @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the value of the sc gap maximum .",
    "because of strong reduction in the density of states at low energies in d - wave superconductors , cooper pair breaking by phonons with @xmath18 is strongly suppressed . in lsco about @xmath19 @xmath20 of the absorbed energy is directly released to the lattice due to strong _ e - ph _ relaxation and only @xmath21 @xmath20 is spent on destruction of the condensate ( cooper pair breaking ) .",
    "the lsco thin films used in this study were grown on lsao substrate either by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe)@xcite or by pulsed laser deposition ( pld)@xcite . the film grown by mbe ( x = 0.16 ) had a thickness of 52 nm with surface roughness less than one monolayer , and exhibited a critical temperature , t@xmath22 , of 31 k. the films grown by pld ( x = 0.08 , 0.21 ) were @xmath23 nm thich with surface roughness of about 2 nm , and tc s of 22 , and 25 k , respectively . the opp experiments were performed in a high sensitivity pump - probe set - up utilizing a 250 khz regenerative ti : sapphire amplifier , delivering 50 fs pulses at 800 nm ( 1.55 ev ) , and a fast - scan technique.@xcite the pump and probe beam diameters were measured accurately with a ccd camera , and were 120 @xmath24 m and 60 @xmath24 m , respectively , to insure a homogeneous excitation profile .",
    "the optp experiments were performed using a set - up based on the same amplifier system , employing a large - area photoconductive finger emitter generating phase - locked thz pulses with spectrum covering 0.2 - 3 thz range.@xcite the thz beam was focussed to about 1.5 mm , while the pump beam diameter was about 3 mm , to insure a homogeneous excitation profile .",
    "experiments were conducted in a wide range of excitation fluences ( 3 orders of magnitude ) , spanning from @xmath25 = 0.1 @xmath24j/@xmath26 up to 200 ( 100 ) @xmath24j/@xmath26 in the opp ( optp ) configurations .",
    "figure 1 presents the photoinduced ( pi ) dynamics probed by the opp and optp configuration at 4k .",
    "the pi reflectivity ( @xmath27 ) traces for different excitation fluences ( in @xmath24j/@xmath26 ) are shown in fig .",
    "1a . like in many cuprate superconductors,@xcite two distinct relaxation components are observed in time - domain studies in lsco , one ( a ) being present only below the sc critical temperature , while the other one ( b ) being sensitive to the opening of the normal state pseudogap.@xcite at low temperatures and excitation densities the component a is dominant.@xcite it is characterized by a rise - time of @xmath28 0.7 ps and the decay time on the 10 ps timescale .",
    "the component b , on the other hand , is characterized by a sub 100 fs rise - time and the recovery that is weakly dependent on temperature and excitation fluence , with the recovery time - scale not exceeding 1 ps . upon increasing the excitation fluence , @xmath25 , the component a shows saturation ( see fig .",
    "2a ) , while the component b increases linearly with @xmath25 up to much higher fluences .",
    "given the fact that the component a can be attributed to suppression and recovery of the superconducting gap , its saturation observed at high excitation densities can be naturally attributed to the complete destruction of superconductivity .    to measure the dynamics of sc suppression and recovery in the thz range , over large range of @xmath25",
    ", we have performed studies of the spectrally integrated conductivity change ( often refereed to as a 1-dimensional scan technique).@xcite here the photoinduced change in the optical conductivity , @xmath29 , is proportional to the photoinduced change in the transmitted electric field @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a fixed point of @xmath32 trace - see the insert to fig .",
    "in lsco @xmath16 @xmath33 thz , so the sc - induced change in the thz optical conductivity modifies the transmitted electric field transient mainly because of the appearance of the so - called kinetic inductance.@xcite to achieve a high dynamic range , @xmath34 ps@xmath35 was recorded ( marked by an arrow in insert to fig .",
    "1b ) , where the change in the electric field transmitted through the sample , @xmath36 , corresponding to the transition between the sc and normal states , is the highest .",
    "the pi traces recorded in near optimally doped sample ( la@xmath37sr@xmath38cuo@xmath2 ) at 4 k and at various fluences are displayed in fig .",
    "1b . similarly to the component a from the opp data , the amplitude of the induced change initially increases linearly with @xmath25  and shows saturation at high @xmath25 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    another noteworthy feature of the data shown in fig .",
    "1 is the dependence of the recovery dynamics on fluence . at lowest excitation densities ,",
    "the pi changes in reflectivity and in thz conductivity almost completely recover , with the characteristic decay time of @xmath39 ps ( using the exponential decay fit ) . at higher excitation fluences , after the initial recovery on the 10 ps timescale , the induced change reaches plateau , with further recovery proceeding on a much longer timescale . as we discuss below , this plateau can be attributed to an overall increase in the film temperature and its recovery is governed by the heat diffusion to the substrate .",
    "indeed , as the excitation density is increased above @xmath40 @xmath24j/@xmath26 , the pi signal at the time delay of 100 ps , which is much longer than the characteristic sc state recovery time of @xmath39 ps , also shows a saturation behavior - see figs . 2c and 2d .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig2.eps    in fig .",
    "2a we plot the @xmath25-dependence of the magnitude of component a , which is related to sc state suppression . in order to avoid picking up the contribution from component b , which starts to dominate",
    "once the component a saturates , we plot the magnitude of the signal at the time delay of 4 ps . to determine the characteristic fluence required to suppress sc",
    ", we use a simple saturation model : @xmath41 the first term corresponds to the saturating part , where @xmath42 is the excitation fluence required to suppress the sc . the second term in eq.([eqsat ] ) is accounting for small contribution from the component b , which at high @xmath25 is not negligible despite the fact that the recovery time of component b is less than 1 ps .",

    "2c , we plot the @xmath25-dependence of the corresponding induced change in the transmitted thz electric field , @xmath46 , again recorded at 4 ps after photoexcitation .",
    "similarly to the opp data , the saturation of the induced change is observed with @xmath47 @xmath24j/@xmath26 . within the uncertainty in the absolute excitation densities in the two configurations , the values for @xmath42 obtained in the two experimental configurations",
    "are identical .    to accurately determine the absorbed energy density , which corresponds to the optically induced suppression of the sc state",
    ", we have measured the dielectric constants of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 at the excitation photon energy of 1.55 ev ( 800 nm ) . by measuring the reflectivity r and transmission t through the film on substrate and through the bare substrate , and using the appropriate fresnel equations we numerically solved a system of equations for r and t.@xcite",
    "the extracted complex refractive index of la@xmath37sr@xmath38cuo@xmath2 is @xmath48 nm@xmath49 . from the measured reflectivity and the extinction coefficient ( @xmath50@xmath51 ) we obtained the  absorbed energy density that corresponds to @xmath42 , @xmath5 . for near optimally doped la@xmath37sr@xmath38cuo@xmath2",
    "@xmath52 j@xmath53 , which corresponds to @xmath54 k@xmath55k per cu atom ( i.e. @xmath56 k / cu ) .    in figs .",
    "2c and 2d , we plot the @xmath25-dependence of the pi change in reflectivity and in the transmitted thz electric field , at the time delay of 100 ps . since this is substantially longer than the timescale for sc recovery , we can assume that 100 ps after photoexcitation the film is in the quasi - equilibrium , where the electronic system and the underlying lattice are thermalized at a given temperature .",
    "similarly to the pi amplitude at short time delays , the saturation of the signal is observed with a characteristic fluence @xmath57 @xmath24j/@xmath26 , which corresponds to the absorbed energy density @xmath58 @xmath59 j@xmath60 k / cu .",
    "we should note that in our case the excitation density is nearly homogeneous throughout the probed volume , since i ) the pump spot diameter is twice bigger than the probe spot diameter and ii ) the film thickness ( 52 or 75 nm ) is substantially lower than the optical penetration depth ( e.g. @xmath61 nm ) .",
    "thus the values for @xmath5 and @xmath58 are quite precise .",
    "the absorbed energy density corresponding to transiently suppressing the sc state , @xmath5 is about 8 times higher than @xmath62 k / cu.@xcite on the other hand , @xmath5 is by about a factor of 5 - 6 lower than the energy required to heat up the excited sample volume to above @xmath8 . using the reported data on the total specific heat for the optimally doped lsco,@xcite we obtain @xmath63 j@xmath64 k / cu .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with @xmath58 @xmath65 k / cu , implying that at fluences above @xmath66 , superconductivity is also thermally suppressed , with its recovery proceeding on the timescale determined by the heat diffusion .",
    "the excellent agreement between @xmath5 obtained by opp and optp techniques , as well as the agreement between @xmath58 and @xmath67 strongly indicate that @xmath15 , where @xmath4 is determined thermodynamically .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig3.eps    to gain further insight into the energetics of the photoinduced sc to normal phase transition , we have performed the first temperature dependent studies of photoinduced quenching of superconductivity .",
    "importantly , continuous heating of the sample is in the case of thin films substantially reduced in comparison to single crystals , since the low temperature thermal conductivity of lsao substrate @xcite is much higher than that of lsco ( especially in the c - direction).@xcite therefore the cumulative temperature increase of the probed spot is negligible enabling such studies all the way up to close vicinity of t@xmath22 . in fig .",
    "3 , we present the _ f_-dependence of pi reflectivity change at time delay of 4 ps , recorded in near optimally doped lsco at several temperatures below and above t@xmath22 = 31 k. above t@xmath22 , all the data fall on the same curve , displaying linear _ f_-dependence of the normal state response .",
    "below t@xmath22 , the signal clearly shows two contributions , one ( a ) showing saturation above _ _ f__@xmath68 , while the other ( b ) showing linear _ f_-dependence , with the slope being t - independent in the range of temperatures studied . by subtracting the contribution of the component b from all the data ,",

    "the large disproportionality between the @xmath5 and @xmath4 was argued@xcite to be due to transfer of a large fraction of the absorbed optical energy to high frequency ( @xmath73 ) phonons on the timescale required to suppress superconductivity ( @xmath3 ps in lsco ) .",
    "on the other hand , in conventional superconductors like mgb@xmath10@xcite and nbn,@xcite the optically induced suppression of sc state also takes place via a two - step process.@xcite here , high energy electrons(holes ) created by absorption of photons with energy much larger that the gap energy , first relax towards the gap via _ e - e _ and _ e - ph _ scattering . the fact that the pair - breaking time ( @xmath39 ps ) is large and excitation density dependent@xcite was attributed to the fact , that during the initial _ e - e _ and _ e - ph _ scattering a high density of optical phonons with energies larger than @xmath16 is generated , which subsequently break cooper pairs@xcite on the 10 ps timescale .",
    "the question arises , then , why @xmath71 in lsco and ybco , while @xmath74 in nbn ? to answer this question , we discuss the nature of _ e - ph _ scattering processes and compare the phonon spectra and sizes of the superconducting gaps @xmath17 between the two cases .",
    "as it was pointed out also in ref.@xcite , the dominant process in cooling of photoexcited electrons ( holes ) is the inelastic scattering by phonons ; _ e - e _ scattering is dominant only if the energy of the electron ( hole ) is far from the fermi energy . here",
    "we would like to address the issue of the energy and momentum distributions of phonons generated by hot electrons ( holes ) .",
    "generally , the transition rate of the electron with momentum @xmath75 and energy @xmath76 to the state with the momentum @xmath77 via emission of a phonon with the momentum @xmath78 and frequency @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the matrix element which depends on the _ e - ph _ scattering mechanism while @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the equilibrium distribution functions of phonons and electrons , respectively . by integrating eq.([eq1 ] ) over @xmath84 one obtains the number of phonons generated by a hot electron ( or hole ) per unit of time .",
    "note that this expression represents only one part of the _ e - ph _",
    "collision integral.@xcite the second part describes the phonon absorption ( mainly cooper pair breaking ) , which is strongly energy dependent in the case of a superconductor with the gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum .",
    "frequently , one is not interested in the momentum distribution of phonons and electrons and considers their distribution as a function of energy only .",
    "however , here one should consider also the momentum distribution of generated phonons . to find the rate of generation of phonons at a particular wave - vector @xmath85 ,",
    "we integrate the expression ( [ eq1 ] ) over the angular part of @xmath86 , keeping the modulus of @xmath87 constant .",
    "since experiments are performed at low temperatures and rather low excitation densities , we can assume that @xmath88 . under this assumption , we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the effective mass of charge carriers .",
    "eq.([eq2 ] ) describes the phonon generation rate by hot electrons ( holes ) . for metals",
    ", we can substitute @xmath91 in eq.([eq2 ] ) by the fermi wave vector @xmath92 assuming  a large fermi energy .",
    "because of the energy conservation , @xmath93 , and momentum conservation , the phonon wavevector in eq.([eq2 ] ) is restricted by @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    in most metals ,",
    "screening is strong , and the matrix element of the electron interaction with optical phonons ( deformation optical phonon scattering , do ) is@xcite momentum independent @xmath97 . since @xmath98 - see eq.([eq2 ] ) - generation of optical phonons at @xmath99 is dominant . yet , since the phase volume of @xmath100 phonons is small , when we integrate eq.([eq2 ] ) with @xmath101 , the total energy accumulated by the low-@xmath87 optical phonons remains small .",
    "the matrix element of the interaction of electrons with acoustic phonons ( deformation acoustic phonon scattering , da ) has @xmath102 dependence,@xcite and thus @xmath103 is momentum independent ; hence , the energy is mainly transferred to the high-@xmath87 ( high-@xmath79 ) acoustic phonons due to their large phase volume .    in nbn ,",
    "the phonon spectrum consists of acoustic branches extending up to @xmath104 mev and the weakly dispersing optical branches at @xmath105 mev,@xcite while @xmath106 mev @xcite . from the above considerations",
    ", it follows that the inital _ e - ph _ scattering process generates a high density of optical phonons and high - frequency acoustic phonons , all of which have energy larger than @xmath16 .",
    "all of these phonons can effectively break cooper pairs .",
    "when on the timescale of cooper pair breaking ( @xmath39 ps in nbn ) the quasi - equilibrium is established between the populations of quasiparticles and phonons with @xmath73 , the excess energy is almost exclusively stored in the electronic subsystem.@xcite therefore it is no surprise that @xmath107 , as experimentally observed .",
    "in high-@xmath8 superconductors , however , in addition to the do and da processes , the scattering on the c - axis polar ( infrared active ) optical phonons ( polar optical scattering , po ) is possible . since the @xmath108-axis plasma frequency is low , the polar optical phonons are unscreened.@xcite as it is well known,@xcite the matrix element of the interaction of electrons with polar optical phonons scales as @xmath109 .",
    "since @xmath110 , the non - equilibrium distribution function of polar c - axis phonons is strongly peaked at low-@xmath87 .",
    "moreover , in the case of po , the integration over the phase volume does not cancel the @xmath111 dependence of the generation rate .",
    "therefore for scattering on polar optical phonons also most of the energy is accumulated near the @xmath112 point of the brillouin zone , and it can be sizeable @xmath113 as demonstrated.@xcite    in lsco , acoustic branches extend up to @xmath39 mev , while the spectrum of optical phonons continuously extends all the way to 100 mev with a maximum in the phonon density of states near 20 - 30 mev.@xcite on the other hand , in lsco  the value of the gap maximum in the anti - nodal direction is@xcite @xmath114 mev .",
    "comparison of @xmath115 mev with the phonon density of states , taking into account the different _ e - ph _ scattering mechanisms , reveals that in lsco the _ e - ph _ scattering creates a high density of phonons with @xmath116 @xmath117 .",
    "the cooper pair breaking process by absorption of phonons with @xmath116 @xmath117 is strongly suppressed even in d - wave superconductors , due to the energy and momentum conservation laws and the strong reduction in the density of states at low energies @xcite .",
    "therefore the generation of phonons with @xmath116 @xmath117 can present a parallel energy relaxation channel , competing with cooper pair breaking . since @xmath118 does not change substantially between 4k and 0.8 t@xmath22 , it is conceivable that relaxation via these channels is the cause of the observed large difference between @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "the calculation of phonon emission rates for various possible _ e - ph _ scattering processes is generally difficult and clearly beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , for the generation of c - axis polar modes via the polar optical phonon scattering such a calculation is rather straightforward , and can be directly compared with the recent studies of time - resolved c - axis thz conductivity dynamics in the superconducting state of ybco.@xcite in this work in addition to the qp relaxation dynamics the dynamics of two infrared active phonons have been investigated , showing a remarkably fast increase in the phonon population density of the apical phonon on the timescale of @xmath119 fs.@xcite integrating eq.([eq2 ] ) with @xmath101 and taking into account that @xmath120 where @xmath121 , and @xmath122 are the static and the high frequency dielectric functions , respectively , we obtain ( see also eq . ( 4.53 ) in ref.@xcite ) @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the permittivity of vacuum . using the values for the c - axis dielectric constants @xmath125 , @xmath126@xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the lattice constant , and the free electron mass , we obtain @xmath129 fs for the generation of one c - axis polar optical phonon with @xmath130 mev .",
    "therefore , in the absence of phonon re - absorption processes , the electron ( hole ) at @xmath131 ev above(below ) the fermi energy releases its excess energy to c - axis polar optical phonons on the timescale of @xmath132 fs , consistent with measurements on ybco.@xcite indeed , the maximum photoinduced softening of the apical phonon in ybco is comparable to the effect induced by a thermal phonon population at @xmath133 k,@xcite suggesting that the phonon distribution function is on the sub picosecond timescale highly non - thermal .",
    "as we have shown , following absorption of high energy photons , hot electrons ( holes ) in cuprate superconductors rapidly relax towards the gap energy by generating large densities of phonons ( predominantly zone edge acoustic and zone center polar optical phonons ) . since in cuprates ( investigated to date ) @xmath16 is comparable to the phonon cut - off frequency , large portion of the absorbed energy is on the 100 fs timescale transferred to @xmath116 @xmath117 phonons without affecting superconductivity .",
    "the doping dependent study - see fig .",
    "5 - reveals a nearly linear increase of @xmath5 as a function of doping .",
    "qualitatively , the increase of @xmath5 from the strongly underdoped lsco towards optimal doping could be understood within the above scenario to be a result of an increase in the gap energy scale and therefore the number of phonon modes with @xmath116 @xmath117 upon doping . however , given the fact that @xmath17 shows a decrease upon entering the overdoped range,@xcite one would expect @xmath5 to follow this dependence .",
    "the fact that @xmath5 shows no decrease in the overdoped regime , however ,  implies that the generation rate of @xmath116 @xmath117 phonons is also affected by doping , increasing with @xmath134 .",
    "the question arises , however , whether the observation that the generation rate of @xmath116 @xmath117 phonons is increasing with doping necessary means that the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath135 is increasing with doping ?",
    "the short answer is no .",
    "the dimensionless e - ph coupling constant @xmath135 , which in the bcs theory determines the value of the critical temperature , is defined as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the eliashberg function , which depends only on the phonon frequency @xmath79 . in general",
    ", however , the eliashberg function depends also on the energy of electron . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider good metals , where screening is large , and the momentum dependence of electron - phonon interaction becomes less important . in this case",
    ", according to the eq.(28 ) of ref.[36 ] , the relaxation of hot electrons can be described in terms of the eliashberg function @xmath138 , which depends both on phonon frequency as well as the electron energy , @xmath139 , counted from fermy energy , @xmath140.@xcite since the characteristic energy of electron in the thermodynamic equilibrium is small ( of the order of @xmath141 ) , it is usually neglected in the eliashberg function which enters into eq.(5 ) , i.e. @xmath142 . however , after photo excitation the characteristic energy of hot electrons is sufficiently higher then @xmath79 .",
    "since the phonon generation rate by hot electrons is proportional to the spectral function of the electron - phonon interaction,@xcite neglecting the @xmath139 dependence in the eliashberg function may be incorrect .",
    "if the function @xmath143 at @xmath139 of the order of the photon energy , @xmath144 , is sufficiently different from eliashberg function at @xmath145 , this can have a very strong effect on the optical energy required for the depletion of the superconducting state .",
    "for example , if hot electrons interact mainly with the low frequency phonons ( i.e. @xmath146 is peaked at low frequencies ) , while @xmath147 is peaked in the range of high - frequency phonons , the initial relaxation of hot electrons may create phonons which do not interact with electrons at @xmath148 and do not give rise to cooper pair breaking . in the oposite case ,",
    "when hot electrons interact mainly with the high frequency phonons , while @xmath149 is peaked at low frequencies , the electrons near the fermi energy are only weakly coupled to the high frequency optical modes .",
    "in such a case , the optical phonons first need to decay into the low - frequency ones before copper pair - breaking can take place , and the pair - breaking process will be strongly delayed .    from the experiments performed on cuprates thus far,@xcite the characteristic time - scales for suppression of superconductivity are in the range of 100 to several 100 femtoseconds . from the above considerations we suggest ,",
    "that  in cuprates the dominant part of the absorbed energy is on the 100 fs timescale transferred to @xmath116 @xmath117 phonons , which do not take part in the cooper pair - breaking process . to further clarify these interesting observations , systematic studies of the cooper pair - breaking process as a function of excitation photon energy , measuring both the dynamics of the condensate as well as that of the phonons @xcite are required , some of which are already on the way",
    "utilizing optical pump - probe and optical pump - thz probe techniques , we have performed systematic studies of the dynamics of suppression and recovery of superconducting state in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 thin films .",
    "the results clearly demonstrate that the absorbed energy density required to suppress superconductivity exceeds the thermodynamically determined condensation energy by a factor of @xmath150 , yet this energy is by a factor of @xmath151 lower than the energy required to thermally heat up the photoexcited volume to above t@xmath22 .",
    "while there is some uncertainty in the existing determination of the condensation energy , it could hardly explain the observed high @xmath152 ratio .",
    "moreover , the lack of  temperature dependence of @xmath5 up to @xmath153 t@xmath22 clearly suggests that the measured @xmath154 , and suggests the existence of a parallel energy relaxation channel . by considering various _ e - ph _ scattering mechanisms",
    "we conclude that in cuprates a large amount of the absorbed optical energy is transferred to phonons with @xmath116 @xmath117 , on the 100 fs timescale .",
    "since cooper pair breaking by phonons with @xmath116 @xmath117 is strongly suppressed , it is the _ e - ph _ scattering to these phonons that presents the parallel relaxation path .",
