    "ever since graphene , a two dimensional crystal with honeycomb lattice structure , became recently available in research laboratories , a new variety of hybrid structures has been explored .",
    "this lead to the development of promising technological devices and the understanding of the non - intuitive physical mechanisms of relativistic - like massless fermions .",
    "it is well - known that electrons propagating through single layer graphene ( slg ) exhibit many peculiar properties , e.g. a gapless linear dispersion around the neutrality ( or dirac ) point which resemble massless dirac fermions , a minimum conductivity at zero carrier concentration , high mobility as well as the absence of backscattering .",
    "when in contact to superconductors , graphene exhibits exotic superconducting properties .",
    "although graphene was not found to sustain intrinsic superconductivity itself , there is experimental evidence @xcite that when in proximity with a conventional superconductor it becomes superconducting . because of the conventional superconducting proximity effect , which describes how cooper pairs diffuse from the superconducting material into metals , superconducting hybrid structures like superconducting - normal - superconducting ( sns ) josephson junctions rise as an interesting systems in which one can study electronic correlation of relativistic - like particles .",
    "these experiments have attracted considerable theoretical attention insofar as it was predicted that a finite supercurrent should exist even at zero doping where the density of states is vanishing @xcite or that specular andreev reflections should happen at the superconductor / graphene interface in slg @xcite . in the ballistic regime , which is realizable in sns graphene josephson junctions according to recent experiments @xcite ,",
    "theoretical studies have shown the existence of a finite bipolar superconducting current through the junction @xcite . with a gapless parabolic , instead of linear , band structure ,",
    "bilayer graphene ( blg ) appears at this point as a suitable alternative for investigating electronic correlations in two dimensional systems .",
    "also , as it is widely known theoretically and experimentally , a tunable gap can be induced in blg by an out - of - plane applied electric field , which is very useful for transistor applications @xcite .",
    "we expect that the role of the gapless parabolic dispersion may be important since the superconducting correlations depend strongly on the electronic properties of the material . moreover , the ability to open a gap in the spectrum by an external electric field could be of interest in superconducting devices .    within a tight - binding bogoliubov - de gennes formalism we calculated self - consistently the pair correlation and the josephson current through a superconducting - blg - superconducting josephson junction .",
    "our findings resemble previous numerical results shown for slg - based josephson junctions except near the dirac point in case of a long junction where a suppression of the current is found , mainly due to the vanishing density of states present only in non - dimer sites .",
    "we also show how the superconducting current can be switched off by applying a out - of - plane electric field .",
    "we consider bilayer graphene in the common ab ( bernal ) stacking with two inequivalent sublattices _ a _ and _ b _ in the top layer , and the corresponding sublattices _",
    "b _ and _  _ in the bottom layer .",
    "we model the interlayer interaction by a hopping parameter which couples the nearest - neighbors in sub - lattices _ a _ and _ b _ from the top and bottom layer .",
    "any additional interlayer coupling terms are ignored in this study .",
    "it is well known that in this case the electron dispersion displays two parabolic bands touching at the dirac point and two additional parabolic bands at higher energies due to interlayer induced splitting @xcite .",
    "we study the josephson effect in a blg - based junction by considering the hybrid nanostructure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ expsetup ] .",
    "the top and bottom layers are both in contact with superconducting leads while a junction of size _",
    "l _ is suspended .",
    "the influence of the superconducting contacts is modeled by assuming an on - site attractive pairing potential , @xmath0 and heavy doping , @xmath1 in the contact regions , which are labeled by _",
    "s _ , such that a s - wave superconducting state is induced in the outermost regions of both layers .",
    "the normal region labeled by _",

    "n _ , we took the pairing potential @xmath3 and a varying chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "phases @xmath7 and @xmath8 are kept fixed during the self - consistently calculation . ]",
    "we solve self - consistently for the order parameter along the junction following closely the self - consistent calculation performed in ref .",
    "for a ballistic single - layer graphene josephson junction .",
    "this is necessary in order to consider the possibility of cooper pairs being depleted close to the interface in the superconducting region due to the existence of the normal region , i.e. the inverse proximity effect .",
    "as is usually assumed for slg - based junctions we consider a clean and smooth interface such that all physical quantities are homogeneous along the @xmath9-direction parallel to the interface .",
    "in addition , we have considered a wide junction , with width @xmath10 , as well as periodic boundary conditions imposed along the @xmath11-direction .",
    "the latter assumptions make it possible to reduce the self - consistent calculation of the order parameter from a two - dimensional problem to a one - dimensional one since we can restrict the calculation to only a unit cell along the @xmath11-direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the pairing potential does not distinguish between sublattices defined on either layer .",
    "however , due to the interlayer coupling , the self - consistent calculation should be performed separately for only two inequivalent sites _ a _ and _ b _ ( or _  _ and _ b _ ) within the unit cell .",
    "the breaking of the inversion symmetry , which is easily achieved by considering a potential difference applied between the layers , makes it necessary to perform the self - consistent calculation for all four sub - lattice types within the unit cell .    in order to describe the dc josephson effect we fix the difference in the phases of the order parameter , @xmath12 , in the outermost parts of the _ s _ regions ( see fig .",
    "[ expsetup ] ) . in a finite region near the interfaces ,",
    "with size of the order of the coherence length , the order parameter is allowed to relax self - consistently .",
    "therefore the phase gradient over the non - superconducting region @xmath13 will be restricted according to @xmath14 , considering that the maximum value of @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "this constraint for @xmath13 was recently pointed out by black - shaffer _",
    "@xcite in a slg - based ballistic junction .",
    "superconducting correlations in a blg - based josephson junction are described by using the following tight - binding hamiltonian with on - site attractive hubbard interactions : @xmath17 where @xmath18vac@xmath19 creates a spin - up electron on the @xmath20-site in the top layer whereas @xmath21vac@xmath19 creates a spin - down hole on the @xmath22-site in the bottom layer .",
    "the hopping parameter , @xmath23 , describes the intralayer hopping integral between next - nearest neighbors in the same layers while @xmath24 correspond to the interlayer nearest - neighbors hopping which couples the dimer sites _ a _ and _",
    "b_. other hopping terms , like the interlayer coupling between the non - dimer _ b _ and _  _ sites , are not considered in the present work , since they influence only very low - energy excitations .",
    "the fermi level is shifted from the charge neutrality point or dirac point by the chemical potential @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the on - site attractive pairing potential which is non vanishing only in the right and left superconducting regions .",
    "the on - site energies @xmath27 and @xmath28 for atomic sites on the top and bottom layer , respectively , have been introduced in order to simulate a potential difference or gate voltage @xmath29 between the layers .    by using the hartree - fock decomposition and keeping only terms relevant to the superconducting order",
    ", one can transform the many - body hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) into a mean - field single - particle hamiltonian , which within the nambu formalism can be written as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the following @xmath33 matrices : @xmath34 @xmath35 where the diagonal elements of the matrix ( [ del ] ) correspond to the on - site mean - field superconducting order parameter @xmath36 .",
    "following refs .",
    "and we have performed the self - consistent mean - field calculation through a numerical approximation of the gorkov green s function by using the chebyshev - bogoliubov - de - gennes method .",
    "both , the normal and anomalous gorkov green s function , can be approximated by a superposition of a finite number of chebyshev polynomials as follows : @xmath37,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expansion coefficients for the diagonal , or normal ( @xmath38 ) , and the off - diagonal , or anomalous ( @xmath39 ) , components of the 2@xmath402 green function are defined respectively as @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the chebyshev polynomial of order @xmath43 , which is defined according to the recurrence relation : @xmath44 .    in order to perform the sum ( [ greenseries ] )",
    "one needs first to rescale the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) such that the eigenvalues lie in the [ -1,1 ] interval . to this end , matrices ( [ ham2 ] ) and ( [ del ] ) as well as the energies have being normalized according to : @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where the rescaling factors are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 being a small number .",
    "once the hamiltonian is normalized , the expansion coefficients can be obtained through a recursive procedure . starting with an initial vector @xmath50 and the first term in the iteration @xmath51 one",
    "can obtain the @xmath43-th term by using the chebyshev recurrence relation : @xmath52 .",
    "chebyshev moments are finally obtained from the scalar product @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are the vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 for moments expanding the ( [ normal ] ) and ( [ anomalous ] ) component of the green s function respectively .    since most of the computational effort corresponds to sparse matrix - vector and vector - vector multiplication , high speed - up",
    "can be achieved by implementing parallel computation on graphical processing units ( gpus ) .",
    "we are therefore able to solve efficiently systems described by matrices of sizes between 88k@xmath4088k and 320k@xmath40320k according to the junction size considered in this study .",
    "additional parallel computations can be implement by considering that all physically quantities calculated here , such as density of states , pair correlation or the josephson current , can be obtained from the green s function for each lattice point separately .",
    "it is well - known that the energy dispersion in slg and blg differ around the neutrality point .",
    "therefore , qualitative differences are expected in the proximity effect as well as in the josephson current in the two systems . for a quantitative comparison between slg and blg josephson junction",
    "we have set up the following values for the physical input parameters : @xmath57ev and @xmath58ev , similar to the values used in a previous self - consistent study for ballistic slg josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "these parameters lead to a finite s - wave bulk superconducting order parameter , @xmath59 , which corresponds to a superconducting coherence length @xmath60 unit cells similar to the one considered in the slg junction case . due to the difference in the local density of states between dimer and non - dimer locations ,",
    "the order parameter is slightly different for these two types of atoms .",
    "both junction length regimes are solved with the proposed self - consistent numerical method , e.g. short junction for @xmath61 and long junction for @xmath62 .",
    "previous analytical descriptions of blg josephson junctions based on the dirac equation @xcite requires smooth interfaces and a low energy regime , for which @xmath63 . here",
    "these restrictions are lifted but in order to compare with relevant experimental scenarios we performed calculations only for situations corresponding to @xmath64 .",

    "[ pairamp](a ) and [ pairamp](b ) , respectively .",
    "we present the pair correlation function for several doping levels in the non - superconducting region showing that the proximity effect is strongly dependent on the relative fermi level mismatch between the _ s _ and _ n _ regions .",
    "a significant difference between blg and slg can be seen for the undoped case ( @xmath66 ) while for other dopings the pair correlation is found to exhibit similar behavior in blg and slg . in particular , we can see that in the undoped case dimer sites in blg show a suppression of the pair correlation over the _",

    "[ pairamp](c ) that the difference between the pair correlation at sites _ a _ and _ b _ becomes larger as the junction length is increased , as large as a few orders of magnitude .      to further understand this peculiar behavior observed only in the undoped case we have plotted the local density of states ( ldos ) in the superconducting and non - superconducting regions .",
    "the ldos is plotted for dimer ( _ a _ ) and non - dimer ( _ b _ ) lattice sites along the inhomogeneous direction in the blg josephson junction away from the _ sn _ interface .",

    "in the absence of applied bias voltage but in the presence of a finite phase difference between the two superconducting sides , a dc supercurrent will flow across the junction @xcite .",
    "this is the usual dc josephson effect . for this purpose a phase bias",
    "is achieved by fixing a desired phase difference between the outermost parts of the superconducting regions , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the left and right sides of the junction respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ expsetup ] ) . in order to numerically calculate the josephson current we solve self - consistently for both phase and amplitude of the order parameter along the junction except in the extreme regions where we keep the phases fixed .",

    "[ currpro](a)-(d ) for an undoped non - superconducting link for different values of the pairing potential .",
    "as we can see , the supercurrent is found not to be constant within each layer separately , contrary to what is usually expected to happen for self - consistent current calculation in 2-dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "self - consistent josephson current as a function of position along the @xmath11-direction for top ( a ) and bottom ( b ) layer as well as the average current ( c ) in the system for different values of the pairing potential , i.e. different coherence lengths .",
    "the interlayer current between the _ a_-_b _ dimer sites is plotted in ( d ) . ]    instead , one interesting feature in blg is the appearance of a weak interlayer current between _ a_-_b _",
    "dimer sites as a consequence of the current conservation law .",
    "we observe that the ldos at the left interface is asymmetric in top - bottom layers while for the right interface the asymmetry is reversed . because of this ,",
    "the current is enhanced at the left interface in the top layer while being suppressed in the bottom layer , therefore a weak interlayer current appears .",
    "the reverse happens at the right interface , but the average current remains flat across the whole junction , as expected .",
    "next we construct the current - phase relation ( cpr ) by performing self - consistent current calculations for different phase differences between the superconducting contacts and doping levels in the non - superconducting region .",

    "note that , in most of the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ cpr ] a complete description of the current over the full [ 0,@xmath16 ] phase - range is not possible .",
    "this restriction appears as a consequence of the relaxation of the phase over the _",
    "s _ region which becomes significant as the flm is reduced in the junction until _ s _ and _ n _ regions are equally doped and the phase drop goes linearly through the self - consistent region .",
    "therefore the phase difference over the normal region will always be smaller than the applied phase difference in the superconducting regions .",
    "a similar constraint is found for slg - based junctions , as is shown in fig .",

    "we find that for no - flm situations the josephson current density and the cpr of the blg is almost identical to the one in slg for both short and long junction .",
    "in contrast , for the undoped and slightly doped cases the short and long junctions have different behavior .",
    "short blg junctions are similar to short slg ones , while for long blg junctions the josephson current is suppressed .",
    "the origins of this suppression could be traced back to the sublattice polarization of the leaking distance which remains even for doping levels lower than the interlayer hopping energy , @xmath76 .",
    "while one sublattice ( non - dimer sites ) has an enhanced leaking distance , the other sublattice ( dimer sites ) behaves like an insulator with a short leaking distance .",
    "the resulting combination corresponds to a slightly suppressed josephson current when compared to slg .",

    "we observe two distinct regimes , according to the relation between the fermi wave - length and the junction length . in the case",
    "when @xmath87 , we observe an enhancement of the josephson current .",
    "this is because the charge density in the junction does not recover its bulk expected value when the blg is under bias ( @xmath88 for one layer and @xmath89 in the other layer ) but has a finite positive value . in this regime",

    "a different dependence of the current is achieved when @xmath90 . in this case for the center of the junction the charge density has the opposite polarity , and the expected suppression of the current with bias voltage is obtained .    in fig .",

    "a doping activation is found in the bias case for an energy value around @xmath91 , in addition a slight increase in the current is observed at @xmath92 due to the enhancement of the ldos above the gap edge .",
    "slg results are included in order to compare directly with blg and show that for the chosen length the current density is slightly larger in slg . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ curr](b ) we focus on the low doping regime and observe that in blg additional oscillations appear , reminiscent of what was previously found analytically in the dirac approximation @xcite .",
    "in conclusion by using an efficient numerical procedure we solve self - consistently the bogoliubov de gennes equations for a tight - binding model of the ab - stacked bilayer graphene josephson junction . when compared to single layer graphene josephson junctions we uncover several regimes .",
    "first , in the short junction regime , the current density is similar for slg and blg for any doping of the normal junction region .",
    "second , in the long junction regime , for undoped junctions , the blg current density is suppressed while for doped junctions ( with doping larger than @xmath93 ) the blg and slg junction behave in a similar way .",
    "we attribute the peculiar behavior of the undoped blg junctions to the difference of the ldos between the dimer and non - dimer sites , which give suppressed or enhanced cooper pair leaking distances depending on the sublattice .",
    "we have calculated the current - phase relation and showed that similar to slg , even for short junctions there is a departure from conventional symmetric cpr . finally , we have shown that by applying a gate voltage perpendicular to the blg a gap in the spectrum can be induced and a supercurrent switch can be achieved given that the junction length is larger than the fermi wave - length .",
