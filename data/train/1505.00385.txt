    "it is well - known that low - dimensional superconductors such as josephson junctions  @xcite , thin films  @xcite , and narrow wires  @xcite sustain plasma excitations : low - frequency collective oscillations of the superfluid charge density .",
    "this is possible as the low dimensionality renders coulomb interactions less effective , thereby reducing the characteristic plasma frequency to values well below the superconducting gap . as a result , at low temperatures ,",
    "the damping due to quasi - particles is negligible . in extended homogeneous systems ,",
    "these oscillations acquire a propagating character with a dispersion relation that is linear for one - dimensional systems and of the square - root type for two dimensional systems  @xcite .    propagating plasma modes",
    "have been observed in a variety of systems , including wire networks  @xcite , josephson junction arrays  @xcite , and high-@xmath0 superconductors  @xcite .",
    "they play a fundamental role in the collective behaviour of low - dimensional superconductors .",
    "for example , propagating plasma modes provide the quantum fluctuations responsible for the occurrence of quantum phase - slips that eventually drive the superfluid - insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "this is relevant in view of recent experiments probing quantum phase - slips in nanowires  @xcite and in josephson junction chains  @xcite .",
    "the propagating plasma modes are also at the origin of the damping of vortex excitations in josephson junction arrays  @xcite .    using modern fabrication techniques ,",
    "the parameters characterizing the properties of the collective plasma excitations in low - dimensional superconductors can be chosen from a relatively wide range .",
    "this is especially true for nanostructured superconducting circuits such as josephson junction chains and arrays .",
    "squid - based chains for instance sustain propagating plasma modes with a phonon - like dispersion , whose group velocity can be tuned _ in situ _ with the help of the applied external flux  @xcite .",
    "this fact has already been exploited successfully in various experiments where josephson junction chains are used as metamaterials providing dedicated electromagnetic environments .",
    "examples are the use of josephson junction chains to obtain a tunable environment in order to study the bloch band dynamics of a single josephson junction  @xcite and to observe the dynamical casimir effect  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we show how the controlled introduction of inhomogeneities in a superconducting metamaterial can enhance its use as a dedicated environment . in general , a spatial modulation of the metamaterial s parameters will affect the propagating modes as well as their frequency spectrum .",
    "an example is the frequency shift found for the modes of a disordered josephson junction chain , together with the formation of localized modes  @xcite .",
    "this offers the possibility of mode engineering : positioning the mode frequencies and controlling the mode amplitudes locally along the metamaterial in order to optimize its frequency response as well as the way it couples to the system one wishes to study .    specifically , we consider a one - dimensional superconducting metamaterial , forming a loop closed by a small josephson junction .",
    "the loop is threaded by a magnetic flux which induces a persistent current in the loop , see fig .",
    "[ fig : configuration ] .",
    "the propagating plasma modes along the loop give rise to quantum fluctuations of the phase difference across the small junction , thereby renormalizing the junction s josephson energy , and hence the persistent current response  @xcite .",
