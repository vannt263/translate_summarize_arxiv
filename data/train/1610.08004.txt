    "the concept of network coding came into light in the year 2000 by a seminal work of ahlswede _",
    "et al._. in @xcite the authors showed that the min - cut bound in a multicast network can be achieved if the intermediate nodes are allowed to do operations on incoming messages before forwarding .",
    "this kind of operation of intermediate nodes has been termed as network coding .",
    "linear network coding refers to the scheme when all such operations are linear . in subsequent works",
    "it has been shown that linear network coding is sufficient to achieve the capacity of multicast networks @xcite . moreover , a capacity achieving network code can be designed efficiently @xcite . as far as a multicast network is concerned , a scalar linear network code over a sufficiently large finite field suffices to achieve the capacity .",
    "however , the requirement of field size can be reduced if vector linear network coding is used @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that binary field is sufficient if the vector length is large enough .",
    "these results related to multicast networks were known by the year 2005 .",
    "after a decade later , there has been a few interesting works related to intricacies involved in linear network coding for multicast network .",
    "in one such result it has been shown that a multicast network being linearly solvable over a sufficiently large finite field does not necessarily mean that over all larger fields it is also solvable @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that existence of a vector linear solution for a certain vector dimension does not necessarily mean that there exists a vector linear solution for all larger vector dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that for a multicast network , the characteristic of the finite field does not play an important role in the sense that there does not exist a multicast network which has a scalar / vector linear solution only over a finite field of certain characteristic .",
    "the non - multicast networks have very different properties . for non - multicast networks",
    "it has been shown that there exists a network where better throughput ( capacity ) can be achieved if the nodes are allowed to do non - linear operations @xcite .",
    "there are non - multicast networks where scalar / vector linear solution not only depends on the size of the field but also on the characteristic of the field @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown in @xcite that for any system of polynomial equations over integers , there exists a network which has a scalar linear network solution over a finite field if and only if the system of polynomial equation has a root in the same finite field .",
    "therefore , there exist networks which are solvable only over fields of certain characteristics .",
    "interesting examples are the fano and non - fano network presented in @xcite .",
    "the fano network has a vector linear solution for any vector dimension if and only if the characteristic of the finite field is even . over a finite field of odd characteristic",
    "it has linear coding capacity equal to @xmath2 .",
    "the non - fano network has a vector linear solution for any vector dimension if and only if the characteristic of the finite field is odd .",
    "if the characteristic is even then its linear coding capacity is equal to @xmath3 .    in the references",
    "@xcite and @xcite the authors considered networks where all terminals demand the sum of the symbols generated at the sources .",
    "such networks have been given the name sum - networks .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that for any finite set of primes there exists a sum - network which has a vector linear solution for any vector dimension if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the given set .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that for any sum - network , there exists a multiple - unicast network which has a rate @xmath0 solution if and only if the sum - network has a rate @xmath0 solution .",
    "they also show that for any co - finite set of primes there exists a sum - network which has a vector linear solution for any vector dimension if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belong to the given set @xcite .",
    "thus , these three results when combined , shows that for any given finite / co - finite set of primes there exists a multiple - unicast network which has a vector linear solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belong to the given set .",
    "however , in the works of @xcite , the dependency on the characteristic of the field is shown only for either scalar linear network coding @xcite or vector linear network coding of any vector length @xcite . in this paper , we generalise the previous results to show that for any non - zero positive rational number @xmath1 and for any given finite / co - finite set of prime numbers , there exists a non - multicast network which has a rate @xmath1 fractional linear network code solution if and only of the characteristic of the finite belongs to the given finite / co - finite set of primes .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we reproduce the standard definitions of fractional linear network coding , vector linear network and scalar linear network coding . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we show that for any non - zero positive rational number @xmath1 , and for any finite / co - finite set of primes , there exists a network which has a rate @xmath1 fractional linear network coding solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the given set . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we extend the results of section  [ sec2 ] to multiple - unicast networks .",

    "if however , the characteristic does not belong to the given set of primes , then , since there are @xmath43 copies of @xmath238 in @xmath322 , and each copy has a @xmath219 fractional linear network coding solution , a @xmath20 fractional linear network coding solution can easily be constructed for @xmath322 .",

    "this is fixed in the following way .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for any network there exists a solvably equivalent multiple - unicast network . to resolve the case of more than one terminals demanding the same source message , the authors considered two such terminals at a time and added a gadget to the two terminals .",

    "this modified gadget is shown in fig .",
    "it is assumed that the nodes @xmath331 and @xmath332 both demanded the same message @xmath333 in the original network ( network before attaching the gadget ) . after adding the gadget",
    ", the modified network has @xmath43 more source nodes @xmath334 , and @xmath335 new terminal nodes @xmath336 .",
    "nodes @xmath331 and @xmath332 becomes intermediate nodes in the modified construction .",
    "this process has to be repeated iteratively for every two terminals in the original network that demand the same source process . in the same way as shown in _ theorem ii.1 _ of @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that after the completion of this process , the resulting network has a @xmath219 fractional linear network coding solution if and only if the original network has a @xmath219 fractional linear network coding solution .    hence , as shown above , corresponding to each of the networks @xmath48 and @xmath238 , there exist multiple - unicast networks @xmath337 and @xmath338 which have a @xmath219 fractional linear network coding solution if and only if @xmath48 and @xmath238 have a @xmath219 fractional linear network coding solution respectively . now by connecting @xmath42 copies of @xmath337 and @xmath338 in the same way as @xmath233 and @xmath322 was constructed from @xmath48 and @xmath238 respectively , the following theorem can be proved in a similar way to theorem  [ thm1 ] and theorem  [ thm2 ] .    for any non - zero positive rational number @xmath1 and for any finite / co - finite set of prime numbers",
