    "among the fundamental parameters of the standard model of particle physics , the angle @xmath5 of the unitarity triangle formed from elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark mixing matrix  @xcite has a particular importance .",
    "not only is it one of the least well determined fundamental parameters of the standard model , it is also the only @xmath4-violating parameter that can be measured using only tree - level decays  @xcite .",
    "the precise determination of @xmath0 is thus a critical element of the programme towards understanding the baryon asymmetry of the universe , and is one of the main objectives of planned future @xmath6 physics experiments ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a method to measure the ckm phase @xmath0 in @xmath1decays by comparing the dalitz plot distribution obtained when the neutral @xmath3 meson is reconstructed in @xmath4 eigenstates to that when flavour - specific states are used has been proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "the method builds on the original proposal of gronau , london and wyler ( glw )  @xcite for a similar analysis using @xmath7decays , and exploits the fact that @xmath4 violation effects are expected to be enhanced in @xmath8 decays since the interfering amplitudes are of comparable magnitude  @xcite .",
    "since the charge of the kaon in @xmath1decays unambiguously tags the flavour of the decaying @xmath6 meson , there is no need for time - dependent analysis  @xcite .",
    "compared to previous proposals for similar analyses  @xcite this method has several attractive features : 1 ) the amplitudes can be measured directly in the dalitz plot analysis , relative to the flavour - specific @xmath9 amplitude ; 2 ) there is no need to normalise to decays with another final state ; 3 ) there is sufficient information to extract @xmath0 using only @xmath3 decays to @xmath4-even states ;-",
    "odd @xmath3 decays with large branching fractions such as @xmath10 are difficult to reconstruct , particularly in experiments at hadron colliders . ]",
    "4 ) the sensitivity to @xmath0 does not depend strongly on the values of @xmath0 and strong phases involved ; 5 ) @xmath0 is determined with only a single unresolvable ambiguity ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "these advantages have much in common with those of the @xmath7 , @xmath2method , which is currently providing the most constraining measurements of @xmath0  @xcite . moreover",
    ", this technique is especially promising for the lhcb experiment since it does not require the reconstruction of neutral particles in the final state .",
    "there is , however , a potential drawback of the method , in that the fit to the dalitz plot distribution is inherently model - dependent .",
    "the magnitude of the model - dependence has been estimated to be small  @xcite , but in view of the aim to achieve an @xmath12 measurement of @xmath0 at future experiments , it is certainly desirable to explore possibilities to remove such systematic uncertainties .    a model - independent analysis procedure has been proposed for the extraction of @xmath0 from @xmath7 , @xmath2decays  @xcite .",
    "the method uses data from charm factory experiments  specifically , @xmath4-tagged charm mesons  to obtain information about the strong phase variation across the @xmath3 decay dalitz plot . a similar approach to probe the strong phases present in the @xmath1dalitz plot is not immediately available since there is no realistic way to obtain sufficient samples of @xmath4-tagged @xmath6 decays .    in this paper",
    "we show that the study of dalitz plot distributions in the decay chain @xmath1 , @xmath2allows to translate the model - independent measurement of the @xmath2amplitude to the @xmath1mode .",
    "this approach allows not only to measure @xmath0 model - independently in this decay chain , but also to use the obtained constraints on the @xmath1amplitude in the @xmath13dalitz plot analysis . for clarity ,",
    "our method is independent of model assumptions in both @xmath1and @xmath2decays .",
    "the more straightforward cases which are either model - dependent in @xmath1but model - independent in @xmath2 , or vice - versa , are also possible but are not discussed in detail .",
    "a fully model - dependent analysis is , of course , also possible .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : idea ] we outline the basic idea and the formalism of the analysis . in section  [ sec : dflav ]",
    "we discuss how possible complications arising from the use of @xmath14 decays as quasi - flavour - specific states can be resolved . in section  [ sec : models ] we describe the dalitz plot models that we use in our feasibility study .",
    "we finally present the results of the study in section  [ sec : sensitivity ] , before concluding in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we begin by recalling the essentials of the @xmath7 , @xmath2model - independent method  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath7 , @xmath2decay can be written @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the amplitude of the @xmath17decay , @xmath18 is the amplitude of the @xmath19decay , @xmath20 is the ratio of the absolute values of the interfering @xmath21 and @xmath22 amplitudes , and @xmath23 is the strong phase difference between these amplitudes . assuming no @xmath4 violation in @xmath3 decay , @xmath24 .",
    "the density of the @xmath3 decay dalitz plot from @xmath7  decay is given by the absolute value squared of the amplitude @xmath25 where @xmath26 the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the cosine and sine of the strong phase difference @xmath29 between the @xmath19and @xmath17 amplitudes decay amplitudes used by cleo  @xcite .",

    "use of external constraints on @xmath46 and @xmath47 , that can be provided by charm - factory experiments  @xcite , leads to much improved sensitivity to @xmath0 .",
    "turning now to @xmath1decays , we find that the simplest approach towards performing a model - independent analysis is not viable .",
