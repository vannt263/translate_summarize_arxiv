    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is the nearest galaxy of the local group with a very populous system of globular clusters ( gcs ) that cover a wide range of metallicity and age .",
    "at least three main populations can be distinguished , namely an old population , coeval with the galactic gc system , an intermediate population ( 1 - 3 gyr ) and a young one ( @xmath3gyr ) .    despite its importance",
    ", there is still a lack of systematic and homogeneous works aimed at determining the accurate chemical abundances and abundance patterns of the lmc gc system .",
    "starting from the first compilation of metallicity by @xcite , the most systematic analysis remains the work by @xcite , who estimate the metallicity of 70 lmc clusters using the ca ii triplet .",
    "other metallicity determinations are based on the lick spectral indices @xcite , integrated infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy @xcite or derived from strmgren @xcite and washington @xcite photometry .",

    "results about the chemical composition of 4 old lmc gcs ( namely ngc 1989 , ngc 2005 , ngc 2019 and hodge 11 ) are presented by @xcite , based on high - resolution spectra taken with mike at the magellan telescope .",
    "+ in this letter we present the first results of an undergoing project aimed at screening the chemical composition of a complete sample of lmc gcs and their surrounding field populations , by using uves / flames . the major goal of our work is to derive a new homogeneous metallicity scale based on high resolution spectroscopy together with a detailed description of the abundance patterns of key metals as @xmath4 , iron - group and neutron - capture elements . + the first target observed in our survey is ngc 1978 .",
    "this intermediate - age ( @xmath53.5 gyr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) cluster is very massive ( @xmath6 , * ? ? ? * ) and located in a high density stellar region , about 3.5@xmath7 north of the bar field .",
    "it also shows a peculiar , very high ellipticity ( @xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the multicolor bvri photometry by @xcite has shown a broad red giant branch ( rgb ) , consistent with a metallicity spread [ fe / h]@xmath90.2 dex .",
    "on the basis of this evidence , the authors suggested the possible existence of two different sub - populations as the result of a merging .",
    "this scenario was furtherly supported by h00 who analyzed the high resolution spectra of two giant stars located in the south - east region of the cluster .",
    "they found [ fe / h]=1.1 and -0.82 dex , with a significant star - to - star difference ( @xmath10[fe / h]@xmath50.3 dex ) .",
    "however , the same stars were previously observed by @xcite , who found [ fe / h]=-0.46 and -0.38 , i.e. a much higher ( by a factor of @xmath53 ) metallicity and a much smaller ( @xmath10[fe / h]@xmath50.08 dex ) star - to - star difference .    in order to better understand the formation and evolution of ngc 1978 , a detailed high resolution spectroscopic study of a significant sample of cluster stars is needed . here",
    "we present the detailed abundance of iron for 11 giants in ngc 1978 .",
    "in order to establish whether a metallicity spread is present throughout ngc 1978 , 11 rgb stars were observed in two different runs on october 2003 ( eso program 072.d-0342(a ) ) and february 2005 ( as a back - up programme within the eso program 074.d-0369(a ) ) .",
    "we used the multi - object spectrograph uves / flames @xcite , mounted at the kueyen 8 m - telescope ( ut2 ) of the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) . the uves set - up ( red arm , centered at 5800 @xmath11 ) provides a wavelength coverage of 4800 - 6800 @xmath11 and a resolution r@xmath12 .",
    "the spectra have been acquired in series of 4 - 6 exposures of @xmath545min each , flat - field corrected and average - combined together for a total exposure time of 3 - 5 hrs .",
    "the final spectra have typical @xmath1340 .",

    "the analysis of the chemical abundances was performed using the rosa package @xcite . the line equivalent widths ( ews ) of the observed spectra have been measured by gaussian fitting the line profiles , adopting a relationship between ew and fwhm ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; an iterative clipping average over a fraction of the highest spectral points around each line has been applied to derive a local continuum .",
    "the details of the line list and the corresponding atomic parameters are given in @xcite .",
    "the stellar temperatures ( @xmath19 ) have been estimated using the ir ( j - k ) color and the transformations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the difference between the two temperature scales in the cool regime is always @xmath20 k , we adopted the average of the two values .",
    "gravity has been estimated accordingly to the location of the stars in the cmd and using a theoretical isochrone of @xmath93 gyr and z=0.008 from @xcite , by assuming a stellar mass of 1.37 @xmath21 , a distance modulus of @xmath22=18.5 @xcite , a reddening of e(b - v)=0.1 @xcite and the interstellar extinction law defined by @xcite .",
    "for the bolometric corrections we used those computed by @xcite . note that a slightly different choice of the isochrone metallicity has a negligible impact on the inferred stellar gravity : indeed , by varying the former by a factor of 2 , the mass changes by @xmath50.03 @xmath21 which translates into a gravity variation of @xmath50.01 dex .",
    "conversely different assumption for the cluster age can have some impact , we find that a 1 gyr age variation implies a 0.05 dex gravity variation .",
    "accordingly to @xcite prescriptions , the microturbulence velocity @xmath23 ( see table 1 ) is obtained by removing the residual trend of the derived fei abundances with the predicted line strengths x ( defined as @xmath24 ) , using a large number ( typically 70 - 80 ) of fei lines for each star .",
    "atlas model atmospheres with convective overshooting by @xcite are used to perform the abundance analysis .",
    "table 1 shows the adopted atmospheric parameters and the values of [ fe / h]i = log@xmath25-log@xmath26 for any abundance quantity a ; log(a ) is the abundance by number of the element a in the standard scale where log(h)=12 . ] and [ fe / h]ii for all the program stars .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 number of lines used to derive the abundance are also listed .",
    "we adopt reference solar log n(fei)=7.54 and n(feii)=7.49 for neutral and ionized fe , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "given the low temperature of the observed stars and in order to avoid spurious effects due to line blending , only a few safe lines were used to derive the feii abundance . in particular , for three stars ( namely , ngc1978 - 21 , ngc1978 - 34 , ngc1978 - 23 )",
    "no good lines are available .",
    "+ plots reported in fig .",
    "4 represent a test to the validity of our analysis . in particular",
    ", the absence of any trend of @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the excitation potential ) with respect to @xmath19 ( mid panel of figure 4 ) supports the reliability of our temperature scale derived from excitation equilibrium should be lower by @xmath31 k with respect to the photometric estimates .",
    "this systematic turns out to be comparable with internal errors in @xmath19 . ] .",
    "similarly , the absence of trend in upper panel is a good proof of the correctness of our microturbulent velocities .",
    "we underline this point because h00 estimated ( for similar stars in this cluster ) a larger value ( tipically @xmath32 km / s ) .",
    "this difference is clearly due to the different metodology used to calculate this parameter : h00 used the observed ews and not , as we do , the expected line strengths .",
    "our spectroscopic analysis based on 11 cluster member stars provides an average iron abundance from neutral fei lines of [ fe / h]i=0.38@xmath150.02 dex and [ fe / h]ii=0.26@xmath150.02 dex from singly ionized lines .",
    "the overall metallicity dispersion is @xmath16=0.07 dex .",
    "the overall error budget in [ fe / h ] has been computed accordingly to the uncertanties in the adopted atmospheric parameters and in the measured ews .",
    "uncertainties in temperatures ( typically @xmath15 60 k ) are estimated by taking in account the errors of the infrared colors ( typically @xmath33 mag ) and reddening ( @xmath34 mag ) .",
    "the uncertainty in gravity ( @xmath15 0.08 dex ) is obtained by quadratically summing uncertainties in temperature , in distance modulus and in bolometric correction .",
    "1@xmath16 random error ( @xmath15 0.11 km / s ) in microturbolent velocity has been estimated from the slope of the abundance / line strenght relation .",
    "the internal errors in [ a / h ] are typically less than 0.10 dex .",
    "finally , the contribution of the ew measurement uncertainties to the abundance error budget was estimated by dividing the average rms scatter of fei lines ( assumed to represent the error of each individual line ) by the square root of the number of lines .",
    "considering all these errors sources we obtain a total uncertanty of @xmath150.07 dex for [ fe / h]i and @xmath150.17 dex for [ fe / h]ii , fully consistent with the ( low ) cluster metallicity dispersion .",
    "this confirms the high homogeneity level in iron content of this cluster and the second with @xmath35 ; only the coolest star ( ngc 1978 - 23 ) is excluded .",
    "the spectra of stars in each group have been summed and high s / n combined spectra were obtained .",
    "we repeat the abundance analysis described above , using the average atmospheric parameters for each group .",
    "the resulting [ fe / h ] from these combined spectra is in excellent agreement with the the iron content derived from individual stellar spectra , the difference being @xmath36 dex . ] .",
    "our average metallicity is in good agreement with the previous estimate by @xcite , who obtained [ fe / h]=0.42@xmath150.04 , while both these estimates disagree with the significant lower abundance ( [ fe / h]=0.96@xmath150.15 ) found by h00 .",
    "unfortunately we did not re - observed the two stars measured by h00 , hence no direct comparison can be done . however , the relatively large number of giants measured in this work and the accurate tests we perform on the abundance analysis suggested that our result is quite solid .",
    "it is also worth noticing that high metallicity estimate for this intermediate - age cluster is in agreement with the recent finding ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the metallicity distribution of intermediate - age lmc field stars shows a remarkable peak in the abundance distribution at [ fe / h]@xmath37 dex .",
    "though the discussion of the overall age - metallicity relation in the lmc is beyond the purpose of this paper , the result obtained here deserves a few considerations .",
    "it is interesting to note that ngc1978 is in the age range where different star formation ( sf ) models provide significantly different predictions in the age - metallicity relation .",
    "for example , the predictions of the two models discussed by @xcite ( see their figure 4 ) , show significant differences for clusters in the 2 - 10 gyr age range .",
    "the two models are also discussed by h00 and compared with some observations ( see their figure 4a ) .",
    "here we just note that the current age estimate for ngc1978 ( @xmath53.5 gyr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and our metallicity determination , place the cluster in a position within the age - metallicity diagram more consistent with a smooth sf rather than with a bursting model .",
    "of course no firm conclusion can be reached on the basis of only one cluster , however we strongly emphasize how only the combination of accurate metallicities and age determinations could significantly improve our knowledge in the star formation history of the lmc .",
    "hence an accurate determination of the ngc1978 age based on highly accurate cmd is urgent to properly locate the cluster in the age - metallicity diagram .",
    "ngc  1978 is one of the most massive stellar cluster in the lmc and it has been suspected to harbor a chemically inhomogeneous stellar population ( see sect .  1 ) .",
    "note that both the most massive stellar systems in the halos of our galaxy ( @xmath38 cen , @xmath39 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and m31 ( g1 , @xmath40 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show evidence of a metallicity spread and a complex star formation history @xcite .",
    "curiously , both these massive stellar systems show a relatively large ellipticity ( @xmath410.2 ) , similar to ngc 1978 .",
    "these properties have been interpreted as possible signatures of a merging event .",
    "hence our findings deserve a few additional comments in the context of the cluster formation .",
    "the fact that our targets are well distributed within the entire cluster area ( see fig .  [ map ] ) and that they show an high level of homogeneity in their iron abundance allows us to safely conclude that ngc 1978 does not show any signature of metallicity spread .",
    "also , the ir cmds presented by @xcite do not confirm the presence of a significant spread along the rgb ( contrary to the claim of @xcite ) .",
    "of course , our finding makes the merging hyphothesis poorly convincing since it would require either that the two sub - units had similar metallicity or that the two gas clouds with different metallicities efficiently mixed at better than @xmath42=0.07 $ ] dex before star formation started .",
    "both these occurrences are quite unlikely , hence we can safely conclude that there is not signature pointing at a merging event in the formation history of this cluster .",
    "moreover , previous dynamical studies of this cluster @xcite already found no evidence for merging .",
    "finally , it is also worth noticing that ellipticity is a common feature of many lmc and galactic clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with no evidence of a metallicity spread .",
    "a few explanations for a large ellipticity , other than merging , can be advocated , the two most likely being either cluster rapid rotation and/or strong tidal interactions with the parent galaxy .",
