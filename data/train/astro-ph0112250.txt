    "the crab nebula has been the best laboratory for investigating the mechanism linking the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) with the pulsar .",
    "the energetics confirms that the pwn is powered by the spin - down energy of the pulsar , and it is generally believed that this energy is transported by a relativistic wind ( e.g. kennel & coroniti 1984 ) .",
    "hester ( 1998 ) and tanvir , thomson , & tsikarishvili ( 1997 ) showed that the `` wisps '' , which are elliptical ripples around the pulsar ( scargle 1969 ) , are moving outwards with a speed of about 0.5_c_. such high energy phenomena must be associated with x - ray emission .",
    "here , we present the results of a series of monitoring x - ray observations of the crab nebula with _",
    "chandra _ , whose spatial resolution of @xmath0 is comparable to that of ground - based optical telescopes .",
    "we adopt a distance of 2 kpc to the crab nebula throughout this paper .",
    "the crab nebula was observed with acis - s3 ( the back - illuminated ccd chip ) eight times , once every three weeks from 2000 november 3 to 2001 april 6 .",
    "these observations were coordinated with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) ( hester et al . 2002 ) .",
    "each observation has approximately 2.6 ksec of effective exposure time .",
    "we employed a 0.2 sec frame time to reduce pileup and a restricted window to reduce dead - time .",
    "the window size is only slightly larger than the x - ray extent of the crab nebula ( see fig  [ fig:2ndimage ] ) .",
    "all of the images shown were made using the 0.210 kev band .",
    "figure  [ fig:2ndimage ] shows one of eight images of the crab nebula .",
    "it clearly shows an axisymmetric structure about the polar jet with the torus and the inner ring resolved in an early _ chandra _ observation ( weisskopf et al .",
    "fine fibrous structures are also resolved at periphery of such large - scale structures .",
    "they show clear correlation with a optical polarization measurement ( hickson & van den bergh 1990 ) , indicating that they trace local magnetic field structures .",
    "figure  [ fig:2468image ] shows a series of the observations .",
    "two wisps moving outward are detected through all of eight observations .",
    "they can also be seen in simultaneous hst observations ( hester et al .",
    "2002 ) . here ,",
    "we denote them as `` wisp a '' and `` wisp b '' .",
    "they appear to break off from the inner ring .",
    "with respect to the inner ring s elliptical shape , the shapes of the wisps look warped due to the time delay of light travel ( hester et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we measured the speed of the wisps , assuming that they are moving in the equatorial plane which includes the inner ring , and taking the inclination of the plane ( the inclination angle was derived assuming the inner ring is circular ) and the time delays into account . in spite of the difference in the directions and the birth times , the speeds of the two wisps are almost same ,",
    "@xmath10.43_c_. their similarity indicates the existence of the continuous isotropic pulsar wind in the equatorial plane .",
    "the inner ring is also variable , but unlike the wisps , it preserves its overall ring - like shape and relative position with respect to the pulsar .",
    "the ring never forms a continuous loop , but appears intermittent and mostly consists of knot - like features . among them , three knots , which lie along the southeast portion of the ring and are symmetric about the axis of the jet , gradually brighten by factor @xmath11.5 within our observational period of 6 months .",
    "however , we note that these knots were bright enough to be detected 1 year before our 1st observation ( weisskopf et al .",
    "additionally , some blob - like features appear to move outward along the jet , with a speed of @xmath10.34_c_.    temporal variations can also be seen in the torus .",
    "figure  [ fig : diff ] shows the difference images of the 2nd@xmath23rd and the 2nd@xmath28th observations .",
    "although the variation is not strongly pronounced in the 3-week difference image , except for the wisps , differences within the torus and along its boundary are quite substantial over a duration of 19 weeks .",
    "the torus seems to be expanding at 0.10.2_c_. due to the small displacement and the ambiguous boundary , relatively large uncertainties remain .",
    "the fact that the angular extent along the major axis measured with _",
    "chandra _ agrees well with those measured with _",
    "( brinkmann et al . 1985 )",
    ", _ rosat _ ( hester et al . 1995 ; greiveldinger & aschenbach 1999 ) , and even from lunar occultation 25 years ago ( aschenbach & brinkmann 1975 ) suggests that the torus is stable on tens of arcsecond scales over decades , but varies on arcsecond scales on several months .",
    "the northwestern region and the end of the jet do not exhibit any strong variations .",
    "these x - ray observational pictures generally match the canonical scenario that the pwn is confined by the supernova ejecta .",
    "the relativistic winds from the pulsar are continuously transported in the equatorial plane and accumulate at the torus , outside of which the optical filaments  ejecta  can be seen .",
