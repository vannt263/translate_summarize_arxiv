    "many physical problems can be described by scalar fields @xmath2 with topologically non - trivial target spaces .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath2 often requires @xmath2 to represent a harmonic map from spacetime into the target space ( in the physics literature such maps are better known under the name non - linear @xmath3-model ) .",
    "the question arises whether a given field configuration is topologically trivial ( continuously deformable to the constant map ) .",
    "topological defects are topologically non - trivial field configurations .",
    "if we consider a topologically trivial four dimensional space - time manifold @xmath4 , non - trivial field configurations are in general singular on a certain sub - manifold @xmath5 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath6 depends on the first non - trivial homotopy of @xmath7 : + if @xmath8 is non - trivial , the submanifold @xmath6 forms a network of domain walls of space - time dimension 3 .",
    "if @xmath9 is non - trivial , a network of strings of space - time dimension 2 is formed . if @xmath10 is non - trivial monopoles of space - time dimension 1 appear . and if @xmath11 is non - trivial textures , singular events of space - time dimension 0 appear .",
    "higher homotopy groups do not lead to topological defects in four space - time dimensions .",
    "the simplest and most common examples of topological defects are the cases @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the sphere of dimension @xmath14 and @xmath15 . but",
    "also other examples play an important role in solid state physics ( helium@xcite , liquid crystals@xcite ) and cosmology@xcite .    in the case of a field living on @xmath13 with @xmath16 simple static domain wall  ( @xmath17 ) , string  ( @xmath18 ) and monopole  ( @xmath19 ) solutions are known ( see , e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) . the question which we want to address here",
    "is whether there also exist static texture solutions ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "a static texture solution is different from monopoles , strings and domain walls in that it is non - singular : a map from @xmath21 to @xmath22 which is asymptotically constant , @xmath23 , can wind around @xmath22 without being singular anywhere .",
    "derricks theorem@xcite then already implies that there is no static texture solution with finite energy",
    ". however , the simple static domain wall , string and monopole solutions we are alluding to ( which contain a singular sheet , line and point respectively ) , have infinite total energy and we thus want to allow also for infinite energy solutions .",
    "we therefore can not apply derricks theorem .",
    "nevertheless , numerical simulations@xcite indicate , that winding texture configurations always shrink , leading to a singularity , the unwinding event , at a finite time @xmath24 , after which the configuration becomes topologically trivial and approaches the constant solution , as predicted by derricks theorem .",
    "the total energy of the initial configuration is , however in general infinite so that derricks theorem can not be applied .",
    "this numerical finding prompted us to search for a proof for the non - existence of static texture in flat physical space .",
    "clearly , the result depends on the geometry of physical space .",
    "if space is a 3-sphere , the identity map represents a well defined static texture solution .",
    "we want to investigate whether such solutions are excluded , for example in minkowski space .",
    "we do not quite succeed in this task .",
    "first , we shall assume that the searched for static winding solution has a spherically symmetric lagrangian density .",
    "this assumption does not bother us too much .",
    "it seems physically well motivated ( we can , however not use any rigorous energy arguments to justify it , since the total energy of our solution must be infinite ) . also within the class of solutions",
    "with spherically symmetric lagrangian densities we have a proof only for a special ansatz for the field configuration and it remains an open problem how general our ansatz is .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section we write down the equations of motion for the scalar field and specify our ansatz . in section  3 we then show that within this ansatz no static solution with non - trivial winding number can exist and discuss the nature of the globally existing ( non - winding ) static solutions . in section  4 we present the conclusions and an outlook .",
    "we consider a scalar field ( order parameter ) @xmath25 and we ask @xmath2 to be harmonic , a non - linear @xmath3-model .",
    "a harmonic map satisfies the euler - lagrange equations for the action @xmath26 we consider the situation where @xmath4 is 4-dimensional minkowski spacetime with the flat lorentzian metric @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the unit three - sphere with the standard metric which we denote by @xmath29 .",
    "here @xmath30 denotes the volume element of the metric @xmath27 on @xmath4 and @xmath31 for some ( local ) coordinates @xmath32 on @xmath4 and @xmath33 on @xmath28 ( we always assume summation over repeated indices ) .",
    "we only consider regular maps @xmath34 , i.e. maps that have finite energy density @xmath35 everywhere .",
    "in addition to being stationary points of ( [ lagrangian ] ) we also demand our maps to be asymptotically constant , @xmath36 at fixed time we then can consider them as maps @xmath37 from compactified @xmath38 , @xmath39 to @xmath22 , assigning @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the winding number of this extended map @xmath42 is a topological invariant and counts how many times @xmath43 winds around the target @xmath22 .",
    "this number can not change under continuous time evolution .",
    "we would like to show that there are no static solutions @xmath2 with non - zero winding number .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to solve the problem in this generality .",
    "we thus impose some restrictions on the maps @xmath34 . one way of doing this is to demand @xmath2 to obey certain symmetry properties .",
    "we want to impose spherical symmetry , i.e. , invariance under @xmath44 , the group of rotations of physical space .",
    "the action of an element of the rotation group , @xmath45 on the maps @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 ( scalar field ) .",
    "the fixed points of the action ( [ groupaction2 ] ) are the spherically symmetric fields of the form @xmath48 .",
    "we might want to require spherical symmetry of the field @xmath2 itself . for our purposes however , this restriction is too severe : since the image of a smooth map can never have a dimension greater than the dimension of the domain , this would limit us to only two - dimensional ranges ( one - dimensional in the static case ) which are topologically not interesting .",
    "instead we will only demand that the lagrangian density @xmath49 be @xmath44 invariant , @xmath50 .",
    "we proceed as follows : we first derive the full euler - lagrange equations and then make an ansatz for @xmath34 ( which is inspired by our symmetry requirement ) .",
    "we then insert the ansatz into the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "since the equations remain self - consistent , we can try and solve them .",
    "the solutions we find are then always solutions of the full euler - lagrange equations .",
    "it remains to investigate whether they can be topologically nontrivial , i.e. , whether there exist solutions with nonzero winding number .",
    "we use standard spherical coordinates @xmath51 for the spatial part and write the standard metric on flat minkowski spacetime @xmath52 as @xmath53 for @xmath54 we use the standard spherical coordinates @xmath55 in our case the @xmath56 are functions living on spacetime @xmath52 , @xmath57 the standard ranges for the angles @xmath58 are @xmath59 $ ] , @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "it is important to note that for a map to cover all of @xmath22 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 have to assume both boundary values , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and @xmath66 must assume both @xmath64 and @xmath67 .",
    "the standard metric on @xmath28 expressed in terms of @xmath68 is @xmath69    the equations of motion corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) are @xmath70 with the standard metric ( [ standardm ] ) on @xmath28 they become : @xmath71\\\\      0&=&\\nabla^{\\mu}\\nabla_{\\mu}\\xi_{2}+2\\cot(\\xi_{3 } )      ( \\nabla_{\\mu}\\xi_{3})(\\nabla^{\\mu}\\xi_{2})-\\sin(\\xi_{2})\\cos(\\xi_{2 } )      ( \\nabla_{\\mu}\\xi_{1})(\\nabla^{\\mu}\\xi_{1})\\\\      \\nonumber      0&=&\\nabla^{\\mu}\\nabla_{\\mu}\\xi_{1}+2\\cot(\\xi_{2 } )      ( \\nabla_{\\mu}\\xi_{2})(\\nabla^{\\mu}\\xi_{1})+2\\cot(\\xi_{3 } )      ( \\nabla_{\\mu}\\xi_{3})(\\nabla^{\\mu}\\xi_{1 } )      \\label{elstd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to obtain a spherically symmetric lagrangian density we use a generalized hedgehog ansatz : @xmath72 the idea behind this ansatz is that we want to make use on the vaste knowledge on harmonic maps on 2-dimensional spaces , which will help us to first solve the 2-dimensional problem for @xmath66 and @xmath73 in the coordinates @xmath74 and @xmath75 and then afterwards solve the equation for the remaining function @xmath76 . the crucial point in order for this to work is that the equations of motion respects this ` decomposition ' of @xmath34 in a @xmath77-dependent and a @xmath78-dependent part .",
    "this is the subject of the theory of @xmath79-equivariant maps which is explained in great detail in @xcite .    with the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) we may introduce a map @xmath80 with lagrangian density @xmath81 the total lagrangian density of the map @xmath34 is then @xmath82 our ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) yields @xmath83 spherical symmetry of the lagrangian density then requires @xmath84 . inserting our ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) into the euler - lagrange equations ( [ elstd ] )",
    ", we find after multiplying with @xmath85 that for the components @xmath66 and @xmath73 these equations are just the euler - lagrange equations of the map @xmath86 .",
    "thus @xmath87 has to be harmonic ( on @xmath88 ! ) with constant lagrangian density @xmath89 , where @xmath90 now denotes the lagrangian density on @xmath88 . but",
    "this means that @xmath87 has to be an eigenmap of the laplacian @xmath91 on @xmath88 with eigenvalue @xmath92 ( in the sense of @xcite )",
    ". therefore the components @xmath93 have to be given by linear combinations of spherical harmonics of fixed degree @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96    if we apply this to our map @xmath86 , we obtain for @xmath97 ( with respect to the metric @xmath27 on spacetime ) @xmath98 we will always assume @xmath99 since we are only interested in spherically non - trivial maps . note that @xmath100 just corresponds to @xmath101 , the identity map , used for example in the ` hedgehog ' monopole .",
    "the remaining euler - lagrange equation for the last component @xmath76 is now @xmath102    it is this equation that we would like to analyze in this paper . in the next section",
    "we will prove the non - existence of _ static _ solutions with nonzero winding number , whereas an infinite family of _ time - dependent _ solutions of ( [ el3 ] ) in minkowski space for arbitrary winding number @xmath103 can be found @xcite .    in @xcite solutions from a geometrical @xmath22 to @xmath22",
    "are studied with the ansatz ( [ el3 ] ) for @xmath104 .",
    "here we consider compactified @xmath38 , which is topologically equivalent to @xmath22 , but with flat geometry .",
    "using our ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) on the geometrical @xmath28 , we can also generalize the results of @xcite by showing that there are actually two countable families of such maps for every @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the eigenvalue of the map @xmath87 defined in ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "this will be detailed in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "all of these results can also be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider maps to the standard three sphere where spacetime is parametrized by standard cartesian coordinates @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in what follows we will use the notation @xmath109    then ( [ el3 ] ) becomes @xmath110 an exact solution to ( [ glg1all ] ) which describes a winding time dependent texture for the case @xmath111 has been found in @xcite .",
    "( time - dependent solutions to ( [ glg1all ] ) can in fact be found for any @xmath112 and for any winding number @xmath103 @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath107-dependence of the last term in ( [ glg1all ] ) shows that nontrivial solutions of the form @xmath113 are impossible for @xmath114 .",
    "however , for static maps the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) becomes @xmath115 and equation ( [ glg1all ] ) reduces to ( @xmath116 ) @xmath117 the equation we will discuss in the following .",
    "equation ( [ glg1 ] ) has a singular point at @xmath118 . since we require solutions to be regular for all @xmath107 and @xmath108 , we assume that @xmath119 is described in a neighborhood of @xmath118 by some power series @xmath120 if we multiply equation ( [ glg1 ] ) by @xmath85 and insert ( [ powerseries ] ) at @xmath121 we obtain an equation in powers of @xmath122 @xmath123.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from comparison of the lowest order terms @xmath124 we obtain immediately @xmath125    let @xmath126 be the smallest integer for which @xmath127 .",

    "if we switch off the damping , we obtain the conservative system @xmath149 where the potential @xmath150 is given by @xmath151 the ` energy ' of this system @xmath152 is conserved , and all solutions are periodic , lying on the sets @xmath153=const .",
    "when we switch on the damping , the solutions no longer remain on levels with @xmath153=const . , but ` fall down into the potential wells ' at @xmath154 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "+    [ stattextphaseu ]    if the damping is weak ( @xmath155 ) they spiral several times around those points , gradually loosing energy and moving towards the center ( under - damped motion ) , whereas if the damping is strong ( @xmath156 ) they move towards the center quickly ( over - damped motion ) . in any case , since the energy is no longer conserved , non - trivial periodic solutions are not possible .",
    "we can formulate this more precisely : if we differentiate the ` energy ' ( [ conse ] ) with respect to @xmath142 and insert ( [ glg1e ] ) we obtain @xmath157 thus the energy is always decreasing with growing @xmath142 ( for non - constant @xmath135 ) . with this",
    "we can show the following lemma :    [ lemma1 ] if @xmath158 , for some @xmath159 , and if @xmath135 is not constant , it tends monotonically to @xmath160 for @xmath161 .",

    "therefore @xmath153 is monotonically increasing for @xmath167 and @xmath168 with @xmath169 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath135 tends monotonically to @xmath160 , the sign depending on the sign of @xmath170 .",

    "especially , @xmath179 which implies our statement .",
    "there is no static texture solution which satisfies the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) ( a texture solution being a solution with homotopy degree @xmath180 , i.e. , one that really winds ) .

    "all regular solutions @xmath193 with @xmath194 are bounded for every @xmath195 as follows directly from lemma [ lemma2 ] and its proof . therefore these solutions exist globally ( cf .",
    "@xcite , corollary 3.2 ) .",
    "( the local existence of solutions fulfilling ( [ staticboundary ] ) follows from our series expansion in section  [ expansionsect1 ] . )",
    "now let us discuss the stability of the critical points @xmath196 for this system which are given by @xmath197 in some neighborhood of a critical point we can approximate ( [ glg1ivp ] ) by the linearized system @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the first derivative of @xmath200 ( with respect to @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) . if we calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath203 and use the principle of linearized stability @xcite we find that the critical points @xmath204 are unstable , while the critical points @xmath205 , are stable , and attractive ( in the sense , that if we start at any point close enough to @xmath196 , we will always end up at the critical point itself for @xmath206 ) .",
    "the solutions thus spiral into a focus at @xmath154 . this behavior is clearly seen in fig .  1 :",

    "remember that from our power series expansion we need @xmath215 for a non - constant solution ( regular at @xmath118 ) .",
    "furthermore , since the ` energy ' ( [ conse ] ) is always decreasing there are no periodic solutions , and thus all non - constant regular solutions must end in one of the two focal points @xmath216 .",
    "we can therefore conclude :    the only non - constant solutions to equation ( [ glg1 ] ) with @xmath217 that are regular for all @xmath107 are the ones starting at @xmath218 and ending in a focus at @xmath219 without ever leaving the strip @xmath220 $ ] respectively @xmath221 $ ] for @xmath140 and some @xmath222 .",
    "this result is also visible in fig .  1 .",
    "we have found that static spherically symmetric harmonic maps ( solutions of the non - linear @xmath3-model ) from compactified @xmath38 into @xmath22 which satisfy our ansatz can not have non - trivial topology .",
    "therefore , if a static winding solution exists , it can not be represented as the tensor product of a map of the spherical angles ( our @xmath87 ) and a radial function .",
