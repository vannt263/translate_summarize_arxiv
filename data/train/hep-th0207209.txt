    "it is believed that the supermembrane in eleven dimensions @xcite plays an important role to understand the fundamental degrees of freedom in m - theory which is a unified description of the various superstring theories .",
    "actually , it was shown that the supermembrane in eleven dimensions is related to type iia superstring in ten dimensions by means of the classical double - dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "the procedure is the following : ( i ) consider the target space of @xmath3 .",
    "( ii ) set the compactified coordinate ( with radius @xmath4 ) proportional to one of the spatial coordinates of the world volume , which we call @xmath5 coordinate .",
    "( iii ) simply ignore the infinite tower of the kaluza - klein ( non - zero ) modes .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether such a reduction is justified also in quantum theory .",
    "actually , it was pointed out that the other set of zero - mode states which are independent of the other spatial coordinate of the world volume , which we call @xmath6 coordinate , do not decouple even in the zero - radius limit ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "hence , whether the kaluza - klein modes along the compactified @xmath5 direction are suppressed quantum mechanically seems to be a subtle question .",
    "sekino and yoneya analyzed the double - dimensional reduction quantum mechanically with the light - cone supermembrane action in the appendix of their paper @xcite .",
    "contrary to the classical treatments , they kept the kaluza - klein modes associated with the @xmath5 coordinate in the wrapped supermembrane theory on the target space @xmath3 and they integrated them out by using the perturbative expansion with respect to the radius @xmath4 .",
    "since the gauge coupling satisfies @xmath8 in the wrapped supermembrane theory , the expansion can be regarded as the strong coupling expansion .",
    "they calculated the effective action for the zero modes along the @xmath5 direction to the one - loop order of @xmath9 by integrating out the kaluza - klein modes .",
    "they found that the quantum corrections cancel out and the effective action agrees with the classical ( free ) action of type iia superstring except at the points where the usual string interactions could occur .",
    "however , as is emphasized in their paper @xcite , the strong coupling expansion does not give a rigorous proof of the quantum double - dimensional reduction .",
    "the free parts of the kaluza - klein modes in the strong coupling expansion have no derivatives and it leads to the propagators which are proportional to the two - dimensional @xmath10-function , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the loop diagrams suffer from the ultraviolet divergences of @xmath12 type , and we need a regularization for a rigorous treatment .",
    "however it is very difficult to find a suitable regularization which respects symmetries ( e.g. , supersymmetry and gauge symmetry ) , and hence the strong coupling expansion is not defined rigorously . in this sense , they gave a formal argument for the vanishing of the one - loop corrections of @xmath9 by demonstrating that the coefficients of @xmath12 coming from both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom cancel out .",
    "the purpose of this paper is essentially to extend their ( formal ) calculations to the two - loop order of @xmath9 .",
    "however , the naive extension is not straightforward because at the two - loop level , even the coefficients of the @xmath12 diverge due to the contribution of the infinite kaluza - klein towers .",
    "thus , we need another regularization for the summation over the infinite tower of the kaluza - klein modes at the two - loop level .",
    "contrary to the case of the divergence of @xmath12 itself , it is relatively easy to find a regularization ( which respects symmetries ) for the divergence of the coefficients due to the infinite kaluza - klein tower along the compactified @xmath5 direction .",
    "in fact , we know the matrix regularization of the supermembrane on @xmath13 in the light - cone gauge @xcite and also that of the wrapped supermembrane on @xmath14 in the light - cone gauge @xcite . the former is called matrix theory @xcite which was proposed to be a non - perturbative formulation of light - cone quantized m - theory in the large @xmath0 limit and the latter",
    "is called matrix string theory @xcite which will be a non - perturbative formulation of light - cone quantized type iia superstring theory in the large @xmath0 limit . furthermore , even at finite @xmath0 , matrix and matrix string theories are conjectured to be non - perturbative formulations of discrete light - cone quantized ( dlcq ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 is compactified on @xmath16 with radius @xmath17 in dlcq .",
    "] m - theory and type iia superstring theory , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper we consider matrix string theory and study whether the reduction from matrix strings to discrete light - cone type iia superstrings is justified quantum mechanically .",
    "according to the correspondence of the wrapped supermembrane with matrix string @xcite , the zero modes along the @xmath5 direction , i.e. , type iia superstring degrees of freedom in the wrapped supermembrane theory , are mapped to the diagonal elements in matrix string theory .",
    "hence , in this paper we study whether the reduction from matrix strings to the diagonal elements of strings is justified quantum mechanically to the two - loop order of @xmath9 , except at the points where the strings could interact usually .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the correspondence of the wrapped supermembranes on @xmath14 with matrix strings . in section [ sceinmst ]",
    "we discuss the strong coupling expansion in matrix string theory . by using the expansion in the path - integral formula ,",
    "we integrate out the off - diagonal matrix elements to the two - loop order of @xmath9 .",
    "we obtain the effective action for the diagonal matrix elements and study whether the reduction from matrix strings to the diagonal elements is quantum mechanically justified or not",

    "note that the light - cone momentum ( density ) , @xmath30 , is constant on the world volume .",
    "when the spatial surface of the supermembrane has a non - trivial topology , we have to impose further the global constraints .",
    "actually , in the case of the toroidal supermembrane , the global constraints are given by @xmath31    now , we consider the wrapped supermembrane theory on the target space @xmath3 and discuss the correspondence of the wrapped supermembrane with matrix string @xcite .",
    "we take the @xmath32 direction as the @xmath16 and identify the radius with the above parameter @xmath4 , @xmath33 thus @xmath4 has the physical meaning of a radius of the @xmath32 direction which is regarded as the `` eleventh '' direction in m - theory . substituting eq.([l ] ) into eq.([action1 ] ) , we obtain the following light - cone gauge fixed supermembrane action on @xmath3 , @xmath34 , \\label{action}\\\\    & & f_{\\tau\\sigma}={\\partial_\\tau}y - \\partial_{\\sigma}a -      \\frac{1}{l}\\{a , y\\},\\\\    & & d_{\\sigma}x^k=\\partial_{\\sigma}x^k-\\frac{1}{l}\\{y , x^k\\},\\\\    & & d_{\\sigma}\\psi=\\partial_{\\sigma}\\psi-\\frac{1}{l}\\{y,\\psi\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath35 run through @xmath36 .",

    ", this action agrees with the light - cone type iia superstring action in the green - schwarz formalism . in the matrix - regularized action ( [ action2 ] ) , such a classical double - dimensional reduction corresponds to the assumption that the off - diagonal elements of every matrix are zero , @xmath48 then the action reduces to the dlcq type iia superstring action in the light - cone momentum @xmath49 sector . depending on the boundary conditions with respect to @xmath42 ,",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath50 in the matrix ( [ diag ] ) describe one or more separate strings .",

    "a string of maximal length having @xmath49 is described by the boundary condition @xmath53 .",
    "it is expected that the above reductions are justified also in quantum theory . however , as was discussed in refs.@xcite and @xcite , the justification is not so simple .",
    "in particular , in the appendix of ref.@xcite , the quantum double - dimensional reduction of the wrapped supermembrane ( [ action ] ) was analyzed for the small radius @xmath4 , which corresponds to the strong gauge coupling @xmath8 in the wrapped supermembrane theory and also to the weak string coupling @xmath54 in type iia superstring theory .",
    "concretely , by using the perturbative expansion with respect to @xmath4 in the path - integral formula , the kaluza - klein modes along the @xmath5 direction were integrated out to the one - loop order of @xmath9 , and it was found that the effective action for the zero modes agrees with the classical ( free ) action of the type iia superstring except at the points where perturbative interactions would occur by joining or splitting of strings . that result is consistent with the expectation that the wrapped supermembrane theory in the region of small radius @xmath4 agrees with the perturbative type iia superstring theory . in the next section ,",
