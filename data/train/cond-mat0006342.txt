    "( [ condition ] ) are satisfied , the functional integral giving @xmath134 is dominated by the extremum of the action @xmath135 , namely the instanton .",
    "we assume that the instanton is spherically symmetric , so that @xmath136 is a function of @xmath137 only .",
    "following standard practice in instanton analysis we identify @xmath138 as the position of a particle along a line and @xmath139 as time , we have the equation of motion @xmath140 with the potential @xmath141 as shown in figure ( 1 ) .",

    "it should be kept in mind that the theoretical curve fails to make sense as @xmath175 approaches @xmath176 which , for our particular parameter choice , corresponds to @xmath177 . also , the numerical data is clearly dominated by finite size effects in the extreme tail where @xmath173 is o(1 ) .",

    "think of the particle being released at @xmath142 with zero velocity .",
    "we divide the trajectory into three regimes : ( 1 ) short time , during which the particle moves rapidly from @xmath142 to @xmath143 , ( 2 ) intermediate time , during which the particle passes through the minimum of the potential at @xmath143 , and ( 3 ) long time , during which the particle slowly climbs the hill to @xmath152 . a priori",
    ", it is not immediately obvious whether the short or long time regime gives the dominant contribution to @xmath180 .",
    "a detailed calculation , which we now outline , shows that the long time regime dominates for @xmath181 .",
    "in the short time regime , we approximate @xmath182 , thus obtaining @xmath183 similarly , we approximate @xmath184 in the other two regimes and match the trajectory , thus obtaining in the intermediate time regime @xmath185 and in the long time regime @xmath186 where @xmath187 substituting into @xmath188 we find that @xmath180 goes like @xmath189 @xmath190 , and @xmath191 in the short , intermediate , and long time regime respectively .",
