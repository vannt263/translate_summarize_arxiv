    "the discovery of the top quark at the fermilab tevatron completed the three generations of fermions as the fundamental structure of matter fields in the standard model ( sm ) . with the large data sample",
    "being accumulated , the cdf and d0 experiments at the tevatron are in a good position to search for heavier states at the high energy frontier .",
    "new vector - like quarks with sizable couplings to the sm quarks are a well - motivated extension of the sm , as they naturally appear in many theories beyond the sm .    due to the precision with which the couplings of light quarks have been measured ,",
    "new vector - like quarks are typically allowed to mix sizably only with the third generation , mainly with the top quark .",
    "however , there can be cases in which corrections to the couplings of the sm quarks due to their mixing with heavy quarks can cancel , leaving no observable trace of the existence of heavy quarks in sm interactions @xcite . the simplest possibility , that we discuss in detail in the appendix , is to introduce two degenerate doublets , with hypercharges @xmath2 and @xmath3 , that only have yukawa mixing with @xmath4 @xcite , in the basis of diagonal yukawa couplings in the up - type quark sector .",
    "this also ensures that flavor constraints are satisfied .",
    "such scenarios can occur naturally in models with warped extra dimensions _ with custodial protection of the @xmath5 coupling _ @xcite .",

    "the superscript @xmath12 denotes that the fields are not mass eigenstates and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the two new vector - like doublets with hypercharges @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the couplings in the physical basis can be easily computed , as discussed in the appendix .",
    "the result is that the corrections to the gauge couplings of the sm quarks are negligible .",
    "there are four new heavy quarks in the spectrum : one with electric charge @xmath15 , one with electric charge @xmath16 and two with electric charge @xmath6 .",
    "the phenomenologically relevant couplings of the new heavy quarks with the sm quarks are listed in table  [ tab : coup ] in the limit @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the heavy quark mass , @xmath19 gev is the sm higgs vacuum expectation value , @xmath20 is the weak coupling constant and @xmath21 is the cosine of the weak angle .",
    "all the other couplings of these new quarks to the sm quarks are extremely suppressed and therefore irrelevant .",
    "more interestingly in the models with extra dimensions that motivated our study , @xmath22 can be naturally order one .",
    "this large coupling , together with very distinctive kinematics , makes single production of a heavy quark an ideal process for its discovery .",

    "let us consider two new quarks , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with masses @xmath32 and electric charges @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",

    "we have not explicitly written down the heavy quark higgs couplings because they do not contribute appreciably to the production process of our interest .",
    "for the purpose of decay properties of heavy quarks the coupling of fermions with higgs can be reabsorbed in the definition of decay branching ratios that we will leave as a free parameter in our analysis .",
    "also , the extra quarks with exotic charges ( @xmath16 or @xmath42 ) can be trivially included by multiplying the corresponding production cross section by the appropriate number of quarks . in eq .",

    "this is unlikely to improve dramatically as the cross section falls off sharply due to phase space suppression and decreasing parton luminosity at large @xmath54 values .    on the other hand ,",
    "single heavy quark production has the advantage of less phase space suppression and longitudinal gauge boson enhancement of order @xmath55 at higher energies . due to the participation of @xmath56 valence quarks in the initial state with the coupling strength given in eq .",

    "we will also comment on the features of five - dimensional models that make natural the apparent fine - tunings of four - dimensional models .",
    "the set - up is the sm extended with two vector - like quark @xmath77 doublets with hypercharges @xmath3 and @xmath2 , denoted , respectively , by q^(0)_l , r= (          ) _ 7/6 , where we have denoted the hypercharge with a subscript .",
    "note that the new quarks have electric charges equal to @xmath6 ( for @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , @xmath15 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we assume that these new vector - like quarks are exactly degenerate and couple ( with identical strength ) only to the up quark , in the basis in which all the sm flavor mixing occurs in the down sector .",
    "the lagrangian reads in this basis = _ &",
    "-&,[full : lag ] where @xmath7 is the sum of the diagonal kinetic terms ( with covariant derivatives , thus including gauge couplings ) for all the fields in the theory , @xmath80 are family indices , @xmath81 is a unitary matrix ( the ckm matrix in the absence of new physics ) , @xmath10 is the sm higgs field , @xmath11 and @xmath82 with no generational index is the sm up quark .",
    "all fields have a superscript @xmath12 to denote that they are not mass eigenstates .",
    "in order to extract the physics from this system , we need to go to the mass eigenstate basis , in which the mass lagrangian is diagonal . before doing that",
    ", we should notice that the charm and top quarks are already mass eigenstates .",
    "furthermore , the charge @xmath15 quark mass eigenstates are simply defined in terms of the current eigenstates as d_l^i = v_ij d^(0)j_l , d_r^i = d_r^(0)i , q^d_l , r = q^(0)d_l , r .",
    "thus , the only non - trivial diagonalization comes from the mass lagrangian involving the up quark ( hereafter denoted simply by @xmath83 , similarly from now on @xmath84 ) and the charge @xmath6 quarks in the new vector - like multiplets .",
    "this diagonalization is done in two steps , first there is a redefinition of the heavy fields , q^(0)_l , r(q^(0)u^(0)d ) , so that the relevant part of the mass lagrangian now reads , = (                          ) , [ two : rotations ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 is already a mass eigenstate with mass @xmath18 and does not need to be rotated . the rotations in eq .",
    "( [ two : rotations ] ) can be computed exactly , but it is simpler to perturbatively expand the solution in the small parameter @xmath88 , as long as the relevant yukawa couplings are at most order one , @xmath89 and the new quarks are relatively heavy as compared with the higgs vev , @xmath19 gev , so that @xmath90 .",
    "the result for the rotations is & = & - _ u _ q ( ) ^2 , + & = & - _ q , whereas the masses read , m_u = _ u v , m_q^+ = m_q .",
    "in particular we see that we need to take @xmath91 in order to correctly reproduce the up quark mass .",
    "note however that @xmath22 can be order one without conflicting with the mass of the up quark .",
    "we will see below that an order one @xmath22 is in fact also compatible with electroweak and flavor constraints .    in the mass eigenstate basis ,",
    "the gauge and yukawa couplings are no longer diagonal and get corrections with respect to their original values .",
    "the fact that we have introduced new fields with non - sm gauge quantum numbers , like right - handed @xmath77 doublets , prevents the gim mechanism from protecting the gauge couplings in the physical basis .",
    "similarly , the fact that the masses not only come from yukawa couplings but also from direct dirac masses lead to non - diagonal yukawa interactions in the physical basis .",
    "we parametrize the new couplings in the physical basis as ^z&=&- z _ , + ^w & = & - w^+_+ , + ^h & = & - , where @xmath92 represent all the quarks with charges @xmath6 and @xmath15 , respectively , the dots represent couplings that are not relevant for the phenomenology of these quarks and @xmath93 is the electromagnetic current .",
    "we separate these couplings in two categories :    * the couplings of light quarks : these have been experimentally observed and are strongly constrained by electroweak precision and flavor data . * the couplings involving one light and one heavy quark :",
    "these have not been discovered yet and they give the main production and decay mechanism for the processes we have considered in this article .",
    "they can be constrained by flavor data if large flavor violations are introduced .",
    "recall that the mass mixing only involves the up quark .",
    "thus only the up and some of the down quark couplings can be modified , whereas the ones of the @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 quarks remain as in the sm .",
    "regarding the first category of couplings , we obtain x_uu^r&=&0 , w^r_u d_i=0 , y^u_uu = c_r(_u c_l+ _ q s_l ) _ u ( 1 - 3_q^2 ) , + x_uu^l&=&c_l^2 1 - 2 _ q^2 ^2_u ( ) ^4 , w^l_u d_i = c_lv_ud_i,[couplings : sm ] where the symbol @xmath98 indicates that we have neglected higher orders in the @xmath88 expansion . we see that no new rh currents are introduced among the light quarks and that the lh gauge couplings get corrected at order @xmath99 . furthermore , these corrections have an extra suppression proportional to @xmath100 and are therefore unobservable .",

    "the coupling in eq .",
    "( [ couplings : fcnc ] ) in particular is the only new source of flavor violation .",
    "the fact that it is suppressed by ckm angles and by @xmath101 ensures no conflict with flavor data , even for @xmath105 .",
    "the coupling in eq .",
    "( [ couplings : small2 ] ) is a yukawa coupling between @xmath24 and the up quark , but it is suppressed by one power of @xmath88 and most importantly by the tiny up yukawa @xmath104 and therefore has no phenomenological implications .",
    "recall that there is another large yukawa coupling between these two quarks that will be the main decay mode of @xmath24 .",
    "finally the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ couplings : zero ] ) are all identically zero .",
    "this analysis shows how one can have a scenario with large couplings of the up quark to new vector - like quarks without conflicting with current experimental data .",
    "a similar analysis could have been done for the down quark by adding two degenerate doublets with the right hypercharges ( @xmath3 and @xmath40 ) .    from the point of view of the four - dimensional model , however , there are a number of features that seem fine - tuned .",
    "in particular , we have introduced two exactly degenerate doublets with identical couplings to the sm quarks .",
    "we have assumed a large yukawa coupling , @xmath106 , between the new quarks and the up quark , which itself has a tiny yukawa coupling @xmath104 .",
    "also , we have set to zero a yukawa coupling between @xmath107 and @xmath41 , which is , _ a priori _ , not forbidden by any symmetry .",
    "finally , we have forbidden intergenerational mixing . however , as we said in the main text , all these features can appear naturally in models with extra dimensions .",
    "for instance , degenerate bidoublets can appear naturally in models with custodial symmetry due to the fact that the two doublets are part of a gauge multiplet of the higher - dimensional symmetry .",
    "another important property of the models with extra dimensions we are interested in is that not all yukawa couplings that are allowed by the low energy ( standard model ) gauge symmetries are actually allowed by the higher dimensional gauge symmetries .",
    "in particular there is a class of models in which there are only yukawa couplings between a particular sm fermion and its `` own vector - like quarks '' ( that correspond to its kaluza - klein excitations ) .",
    "this could explain why there is a yukawa coupling with the up but not with the down quark , for instance .",
    "a final important point from a model - building perspective is the large difference in the size of the two yukawas @xmath108 , which can be easily understood from the structure of the yukawas of the higher dimensional multiplets .",
    "let us exemplify it in a simplified four - dimensional model that simulates the extra - dimensional set - up .",
    "assume we have the matter content we have considered so far , the sm quarks plus two vector - like doublets with hypercharges @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , plus a vector - like singlet @xmath109 with hypercharge @xmath6 ( same quantum numbers as the sm @xmath4 quark ) .",
    "assume the two doublets and the @xmath4 live in the same higher dimensional multiplet and therefore they have yukawa couplings among themselves .",
    "similarly , the new singlet is in the same multiplet as @xmath110 and therefore it only has yukawa couplings with it .",
    "finally , @xmath4 and @xmath111 have the same quantum numbers and therefore can have a direct dirac mass coupling them ( for simplicity , we will also assume that the allowed dirac mass coupling @xmath110 and @xmath112 is vanishing ) .",
    "the resulting mass matrix lagrangian reads = (              ) + note that this mass matrix is non - diagonal even in the absence of electroweak symmetry breaking ( _ i.e. _ @xmath113 ) .",
    "in order to obtain a diagonal matrix in the absence of electroweak symmetry breaking , we perform the following rotation , (                          ) + if @xmath115 is much larger than @xmath18 , the effects of the singlet can be safely neglected and we just have to look at the @xmath116 submatrix involving the sm quarks and the two doublets . in that case , we recover our original lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ full : lag ] ) , with the identifications _ u = s_0 _ u , _ q = c_0 _ q. thus , starting with all yukawa couplings order one , @xmath117 , we see that @xmath118 requires @xmath119 and therefore @xmath120 .",
    "note that if the up quark was heavier ( or for heavier generations ) , then it is not necessary that @xmath121 be this small , in which case @xmath122 would have been smaller resulting in the coupling @xmath22 being smaller as well .",
    "thus , in this class of constructions which can naturally appear in models with extra dimensions , the coupling @xmath22 is large , _ precisely _ because the up quark is so light .",
    "an example of these features is the model in ref .",
    "this model was constructed with electroweak symmetry breaking in mind , which only involves third generation quarks .",
    "it has however all the ingredients to realize the set - up we study in this paper .",
    "there are light kaluza - klein excitations of five - dimensional quarks ( which are vector - like ) , with masses in the range @xmath123 gev , that come in degenerate doublets with hypercharges @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "as we mentioned , they are degenerate because they belong to the same multiplet of a higher symmetry , a bidoublet of so(4 ) , and have the same boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore , the two degenerate doublets and @xmath124 live in different five - dimensional multiplets , whereas @xmath82 lives in a superposition of both explaining that @xmath22 ( _ i.e. _ the corresponding @xmath57 ) is large , precisely because the up quark is so light ( @xmath101 so small ) .",
    "finally , although flavor issues were not discussed in that reference , the flavor constraints in warped models  @xcite , require some sort of flavor symmetry protection  @xcite that could easily explain why intergenerational mixing is forbidden . as an example , one point for the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath125 gev and @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "the fact that all these ingredients can naturally appear in successful models of electroweak symmetry breaking has motivated us to perform this study .",
