    "in recent years , surveys have begun to find young brown dwarfs with spectral types extending into the l dwarf regime @xcite .",
    "the low gravity , and hence youth , of these objects has typically been determined via a triangular h - band continuum shape which exists for brown dwarfs until they are at least tens of myr old ( log @xmath7 4.5 * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the masses of these sources have been estimated by placing them on an h - r diagram , with temperatures determined by either fitting theoretical spectra to observed spectra @xcite or by using a spectral  type - temperature relationship that is intermediate between dwarf and giant stars @xcite .",
    "both of these methods have systematic uncertainties which grow as one moves to later spectral types .",
    "spectral types of several young , late - m type brown dwarfs have been determined by comparing observed optical spectra to spectra of giants and dwarfs , with the best fit usually being an average of giant and dwarf spectra @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( sed s ) of late - m type objects peak in the near - ir @xcite , making them , particularly in the presence of foreground reddening , easier to observe in the near - ir than in the optical .",
    "an infrared spectral type classification scheme for young , late - m type objects has been developed by comparing their infrared spectra to those of optically classified young objects @xcite .",
    "spectral types can then be converted to t@xmath5 using a temperature scale ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which is intermediate to spt - t@xmath5 relationships for field m dwarfs @xcite and m giants @xcite .",
    "the tools available for classifying young l type brown dwarfs are considerably less well - developed than the tools for classifying young m stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "the l subclass for field dwarfs is defined by the disappearance of tio and vo bands as seen in their optical spectra @xcite . to date , however , there are only five young , optically classified l dwarfs , three of which are field objects displaying spectral signatures of youth @xcite and two of which were recently identified in nearby star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "the young l dwarfs identified to date are early - l type ( l0-l2 ) ; it remains unclear how to classify cooler young brown dwarfs , if and when they are found .",
    "there are no l giant stars that could be combined with field dwarf observations to fit a spectral type to young objects . even if a spectral type for a young l dwarf could be determined , the spt ",
    "t@xmath5 relationship is unknown for young l brown dwarfs , and there is no l - giant sequence to which one could compare the temperature  spectral type relation . in this paper",
    "we discuss the spectral properties of a sample of six m6l1 young brown dwarfs and low mass stars identified by @xcite , and by comparison to field dwarfs and giants , develop an empirical scheme for determining the spt and verifying the low - gravity of young objects , with a view toward studying young objects of even later spectral type .",

    "we tested indices of ki , nai , vo , feh , and co , and found that the only index which had little correlation with spt and had well separated index values for high ( field dwarf ) and low ( young objects and giants ) gravity objects was one based on the 1.14  @xmath0 m nai feature .",

    "are higher than the @xcite t@xmath5 s , slightly so ( @xmath10100 k ) in two cases , but more significantly ( 200 - 500 k ) for the remaining objects .    we have calculated the luminosities of our objects using the method described in @xcite , but using the values of a@xmath23 in table [ teff ] .",
    "the positions of our ophiuchus sources are within the boundary of the upper scorpius region , so we use a distance of 145@xmath320  pc @xcite to calculate the luminosities of oph1623 - 2338 and oph1622 - 2405 , rather than the 125  pc distance ( appropriate for the ophiuchus cloud core ) adopted by the `` cores to disks '' spitzer legacy team and used by @xcite . the uncertainties in luminosity , including photometric , a@xmath23 , and distance uncertainties , total 0.10 and 0.13  dex for our sources in chamaeleon ii and ophiuchus / upper sco respectively .",
    "our calculated luminosities ( table [ teff ] ) agree to within 0.2 dex with the @xcite luminosities for all of the sources in our sample .",

    "the derived ages and therefore the masses of our two brightest sources ( oph1623 - 2338 and cha1258 - 7709 ) , as determined from the cbah00 model isochrones ( 5 and 1  myr respectively ) , are in good agreement with the 1  myr and 3  myr ages assumed for ophiuchus and chamaeleon ii in @xcite . using the dm97 model isochrones yields ages for oph1623 - 2338 and cha1258 - 7709 ( 7 and 3  myr respectively ) that are in good agreement with the cbah00 model results , however , the masses estimated from dm97 are 1.6 times greater than those estimated from cbah00 for these two sources .",
    "the luminosity and temperature of our faintest source , cha1305 - 7739 , do not fall within the dm97 model parameter space , but the age and mass we derive using the cbah00 isochrones ( 10  myr , 15  m@xmath15 ) agree to well within the uncertainties with the age of the chamaeleon ii cloud and the 10  m@xmath15 mass from @xcite .",
    "the other three sources ( cha1257 - 7701 , oph1622 - 2405b and oph1622 - 2405a ) have implied ages of 2030  myr ( cbah isochrones ) or 1015  myr ( dm97 isochrones ) , and masses @xmath124 times larger than those reported by @xcite .",
    "given that two of these sources ( cha1257 - 7701 and oph1622 - 2405b ) show mid - ir excess emission , presumably from a circumstellar disk , and that typical lifetimes for t  tauri disks are @xmath106  myr @xcite , it is unlikely that these sources are 20 and 30  myr old if brown dwarf disks have similar lifetimes as t  tauri disks .",
    "our near - ir spectra of these sources also show that they must be young ( based on their h - band continuum shape and nai indices ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the @xcite and our derived t@xmath5 s , masses and ages from the same group of model isochrones could be a result of 1 ) our choice of spt  t@xmath5 relation , 2 ) an underestimation of the source luminosities , or 3 ) an older population of brown dwarfs associated with the chamaeleon ii and ophiuchus regions that still show signatures of youth .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty in the derived masses and ages of our objects lies in the evolutionary models themselves .",
    "further discussion of each of these possibilities follows .",
    "a possible source of the inconsistency in the effective temperatures and masses from @xcite and those in figure [ hr ] lies in the sensitivity of the derived parameters to the choice of spt ",
    "t@xmath5 relation .",
    "the best available relation is a compromise between the spt - t@xmath5 relation for field dwarfs and that for giants @xcite .",

    "the sources lie along the 1 myr isochrone , consistent with ages of other taurus ysos .",
    "interestingly , the 1 myr isochrone is parallel to the 3 myr isochrone at both higher and lower temperatures , but , just in the temperature range relevant for ttau bb ( @xmath12800  k ) , the 1 myr isochrone jumps closer to the 3 myr line @xcite .",

    "<S> we present near - infrared ( 1.02.4  @xmath0 m ) spectra confirming the youth and cool effective temperatures of 6 brown dwarfs and low mass stars with circumstellar disks toward the chamaeleon ii and ophiuchus star forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of one of our objects indicates that it has a spectral type of @xmath1l1 , making it one of the latest spectral type young brown dwarfs identified to date . comparing spectra of young brown dwarfs , field dwarfs , and giant stars , </S>",
    "<S> we define a 1.491.56 @xmath0 m h@xmath2o index capable of determining spectral type to @xmath31 sub - type , independent of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we have also defined an index based on the 1.14 @xmath0 m sodium feature that is sensitive to gravity , but only weakly dependent on spectral type for field dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> our 1.14 @xmath0 m na index can be used to distinguish young cluster members ( @xmath4  myr ) from young field dwarfs , both of which may have the triangular h - band continuum shape which persists for at least tens of myr . using t@xmath5 s </S>",
    "<S> determined from the spectral types of our objects along with luminosities derived from near and mid - infrared photometry , we place our objects on the h - r diagram and overlay evolutionary models to estimate the masses and ages of our young sources . </S>",
    "<S> three of our sources have inferred ages ( @xmath61030  myr ) significantly older than the median stellar age of their parent clouds ( 13  myr ) . </S>",
    "<S> for these three objects , we derive masses @xmath13 times greater than expected for 13  myr old brown dwarfs with the bolometric luminosities of our sources . </S>",
    "<S> the large discrepancies in the inferred masses and ages determined using two separate , yet reasonable methods , emphasize the need for caution when deriving or exploiting brown dwarf mass and age estimates . </S>"
