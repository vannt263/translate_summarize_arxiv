    "the power of a vibration - based generator strongly depends on the load .",
    "the power is maximized for matching load resistances , whose values are determined by the transducer figure of merit , external acceleration and vibration frequency @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of optimizing power generated by a velocity damped resonant generator ( vdrg ) , taking into account both of mechanical damping and electrical damping , is reported by mitcheson et al . @xcite . in summary , for unconstrained displacement or small forcing levels , and significant mechanical damping , the harvested power can be maximized by designing the electrical damping equal to the mechanical damping while the drive frequency is kept fix at resonant frequency .",
    "a bound on the output power of vibration energy harvesters when the proof mass is subject to parasitic , linear mechanical damping is determined on closed - form @xcite .",
    "halvorsen et at . proved that the optimal vdrg performance for a single sinusoid forcing coincides with the bound when the displacement is unconstrained .",

    "<S> this work is devoted to demonstration of the mathematical analysis on maximizing the output power harvested from vibration energy harvester under a single sinusoid input with time - dependent amplitude or drive frequency . </S>",
    "<S> while most of recent works have investigated the use of mechanical nonlinearities to increase extractable power , or determining the optimal resistive load at steady - state operation of the transducers , real - time optimization problems have not been explored yet . in this paper , the stiffness and the electrical time constant are regarded as control subjects of linear two - port harvesters . </S>",
    "<S> the mathematical model is treated as an optimal control problem . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of optimal controls is provided by means of _ pontryagin maximum principle_. furthermore , making use of geometric methods of optimal control theory for this model , we are able to point out the _ bang - bang _ property of optimal controls . finally , numerical results are illustrated to support our theoretical analysis and approach . </S>"
