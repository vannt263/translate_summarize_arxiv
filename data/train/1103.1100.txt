    "since the ads metric ( [ eq : adsz ] ) is invariant under a dilatation of all coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 , it follows that the additional dimension , the holographic variable @xmath1 , acts as a scaling variable in minkowski space : different values of @xmath1 correspond to different energy scales at which the hadron is examined . as a result ,",

    "this also leads to finite moments at @xmath235 , as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ pionff ] .",
    "since the computation of the form factor involves a twist-3 current @xmath217 , the poles do not correspond to the physical poles of the twist-2 transverse current @xmath236 present in the annihilation channel .",
    "consequently , the location of the poles in the final result should be rescaled to their physical positions . when this is done the results",
    "agree extremely well with available data .",
    "the non - perturbative effects from the  dressed \" current correspond to an infinite sum of diagrams .",
    "one should however be careful to avoid a double counting of terms .",
    "this important point deserves further investigation .",
    "the light - front holographic approach described in this paper provides a direct correspondence between an effective gravity theory defined in a fifth - dimensional warped space with a semiclassical approximation to strongly coupled qcd quantized on the light - front .",
    "this duality leads to a lorentz - invariant relativistic schrdinger wave equation  @xcite which provides a successful prediction for the light - quark meson and baryon spectra as a function of hadron spin , quark angular momentum , and radial quantum numbers .",
    "it also predicts the same multiplicity of states for mesons and baryons which is observed experimentally .",
    "thus this ads / qcd approach encodes the salient features of qcd .",
    "we originally derived light - front holography using the identity between electromagnetic and gravitational form factors computed in ads and light - front theory .",
    "@xcite the results for hadronic form factors are also successful , and the predicted power law fall - off agrees with dimensional counting rules as required by conformal invariance at small @xmath1 . in particular , we have shown the importance of including non - perturbative effects corresponding to the infinite sum of diagrams contained in the structure of the currents propagating in the confining geometry .",
    "this  dressed \" current is required to reproduce the time - like pole structure and finite moments near @xmath237 , effects which are not seen in the semiclassical approximation when comparing state by state .",
    "the semiclassical approximation to light - front qcd described in this paper does not account for particle creation and absorption ; it is thus expected to break down at short distances where hard gluon exchange and quantum corrections become important",
    ". other shortcomings of holographic methods are discussed in ref .",

    "<S> we give an overview of the light - front holographic approach to strongly coupled qcd , whereby a confining gauge theory , quantized on the light front , is mapped to a higher - dimensional anti de sitter ( ads ) space . </S>",
    "<S> the framework is guided by the ads / cft correspondence incorporating a gravitational background asymptotic to ads space which encodes the salient properties of qcd , such as the ultraviolet conformal limit at the ads boundary at @xmath0 , as well as modifications of the geometry in the large @xmath1 infrared region to describe confinement and linear regge behavior . </S>",
    "<S> there are two equivalent procedures for deriving the ads / qcd equations of motion : one can start from the hamiltonian equation of motion in physical space time by studying the off - shell dynamics of the bound state wavefunctions as a function of the invariant mass of the constituents . to a first semiclassical approximation , where quantum loops and quark masses are not included , </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a light - front hamiltonian equation which describes the bound state dynamics of light hadrons in terms of an invariant impact variable @xmath2 which measures the separation of the partons within the hadron at equal light - front time . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one can start from the gravity side by studying the propagation of hadronic modes in a fixed effective gravitational background . </S>",
    "<S> both approaches are equivalent in the semiclassical approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to identify the holographic variable @xmath1 in ads space with the impact variable @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> light - front holography thus allows a precise mapping of transition amplitudes from ads to physical space - time . </S>",
    "<S> the internal structure of hadrons is explicitly introduced and the angular momentum of the constituents plays a key role . </S>"
