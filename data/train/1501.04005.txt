    "the simultaneous presence of superconductivity ( sc ) and magnetism ( m ) , competing and/or coexisting in various families of iron - based superconductors , has captured the interest of the condensed matter community for many years now .",
    "particular attention has been devoted to the ln1111 family ( ln being a lanthanide ) , where the static long - range antiferromagnetic order ( afm ) , occurring in the feas planes , is progressively suppressed in favor of the superconducting state by carrier - doping of the parent compound . in the ln1111 family the m - sc crossover region",
    "is characterized by the coexistence of a short - range afm order and superconductivity on a nanoscopic length scale .",
    "this distinctive feature has been shown to be independent of the doping agent , since it occurs both in h - doped la1111,@xcite as well as on f - doped ce-1111,@xcite or sm-1111.@xcite while this suggests that h or f act merely as electron donors ( although with different efficiencies ) , it leaves open the question of the lanthanide ions , i.e. : are the m - sc ground - state properties of the ln1111 family also independent of the ln ion ?    to address this issue and to better understand the role of lno planes on the occurrence of a m / sc ground state , we considered the case of ndfeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 , a family about which relatively fewer studies have been published insofar , none of which addressing this important point .",
    "in particular , since the discovery of superconductivity in a nd1111 compound in 2008,@xcite most of the studies focused on the evolution of the structural and superconducting properties induced either by f - doping,@xcite or by simple oxygen deficiency.@xcite the magnetic properties of the undoped compound and those of an @xmath5 under - doped sample were reported in refs .   and , respectively . in the latter case",
    "it was emphasized that the dc magnetization response is dominated by the curie - weiss paramagnetism of the nd@xmath6 ions , whereas no signs of long - range antiferromagnetic order , due either to nd@xmath6 or to fe@xmath7 ions , could be detected below @xmath8 . later on , mssbauer - effect studies confirmed the absence of magnetically - ordered phases in an @xmath9 superconducting sample.@xcite @xmath3sr  measurements on either undoped,@xcite or on f - doped@xcite samples were performed , too . in the former case",
    "they could detect an afm long - range magnetic order with @xmath10k and a local field @xmath11 t , while in the latter a gapped - like superfluid density was inferred .",
    "unfortunately , due to the lack of good - quality , finely - tuned f - doped samples , a systematic study of the most interesting region , that of the m - sc crossover , has been missing to date .",
    "+ in the present paper we address exactly this issue by investigating via @xmath3sr  four different f - doped polycrystalline samples with @xmath12 , 0.05 , 0.08 , and 0.25 . in the first two cases we find a long - range af order , that gradually extinguishes as the f content increases . on the other hand , in the @xmath13 sample , we do not find any magnetically ordered phases .",
    "the intermediate @xmath14 case , instead , is particularly remarkable since here we detect the simultaneous presence of bulk superconductivity ( below @xmath15k ) and of short - range magnetic order ( below @xmath16k ) .",
    "interestingly , in an intermediate @xmath17 temperature range , sizable spin - fluctuations with a slow dynamics dominate .",
    "we ascribe these magnetic spin fluctuations to the glassy character of the ordered magnetic phase . + in a broader context",

    "a series of ndfeaso@xmath1f@xmath2  polycrystalline samples , with nominal fluorine content ranging from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , was prepared at eth zurich using cubic - anvil , high - pressure , and high - temperature techniques.@xcite due to the toxicity of arsenic , all procedures related to the sample preparation were performed in a glove box .",
    "pellets containing the high - purity ( @xmath20 ) precursors ( ndas , feas , fe@xmath21o@xmath22 , fe , and ndf@xmath22 ) were enclosed in a boron nitride container and placed inside a graphite heater .",
    "six tungsten carbide anvils generated the required high pressure ( 3 gpa ) on the assembly .",
    "while the pressure was kept constant , the temperature was ramped up in 2 h , from @xmath23c to the maximum value of @xmath24c , and maintained there for 15 h. following the temperature quenching , the pressure was released and the sample removed .",
    "the structural characterization was performed by means of standard powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements carried out at room temperature .",
    "the crystalline structure was refined using the rietveld technique .",
    "the lattice constants , the type of impurities , and the respective volume fractions are reported in table  [ tab : xrdiff ] .",

    "we note two important features : ( _ i _ ) the @xmath25-axis length is slightly reduced with doping .",
    "this effect is almost ln - independent and has been ascribed to the presence of small oxygen deficiencies in samples grown at high pressure.@xcite ( _ ii _ ) the @xmath26-axis length decreases linearly with increasing @xmath27(f ) , too . in this case",
    ", the replacement of oxygen with the more electronegative fluorine implies a reduction of the unit - cell volume as the f content increases .",

    "the absence of muon - spin precession and a large damping of asymmetry at short times clearly indicate the presence of a wide distribution of fields .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether this distribution is due to static fields , or to strongly fluctuating ( i.e. , dynamic ) magnetic moments . to disentangle these two possibilities , we carried out longitudinal - field ( lf ) @xmath3sr measurements at 30k .",
    "this temperature represents a good compromise , since it is above the superconducting critical temperature @xmath42 k ( see fig .  [",

    "an understanding of the f - doping effects in nd1111 compounds , both regarding their magnetic and superconducting properties , as well as the possible presence of an m - sc crossover region , is expected to provide a more complete picture of the iron - arsenide superconductors .",
    "the results of our systematic investigation of the structural and magnetic properties of representative compounds of the nd family are summarized and discussed in detail below .      in nd1111 the macroscopic magnetic behavior ( dc susceptibility )",

    "[ fig : fig10 ] , the main feature of the phase diagram is the presence of a narrow region where electron doping induces both _ bulk _ superconductivity and feas magnetic order in the _ whole _ sample volume .",
    "the most reasonable way of reconciling the simultaneous presence of m and sc bulk phenomena is to assume their coexistence at a _",
    "nanometer length scale _ , as already invoked in the case of the sm1111,@xcite ce1111,@xcite and la1111@xcite families .",
    "therefore , one can most likely conclude that this particular kind of m - sc coexistence is a common feature of all the ln1111 iron pnictides , independent of the lanthanide ion .",
    "on the other hand , contrary to the above cases , the @xmath41 sample of the nd1111 family shows clear signs of non - negligible _ magnetic fluctuations _ near the feas ordering temperature .",
    "this peculiar feature is discussed in detail in the following section",
    ".      the muon lf asymmetry data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] exhibit two clearly distinct relaxation regimes ( see , e.g. , data at @xmath52mt ) . at short times , the ( fast ) relaxation is dominated by static magnetic moments ( on the @xmath3sr  time scale ) , while at long times , the ( slow ) asymmetry relaxation rate ( @xmath53 ) is mostly determined by dynamic ( i.e. , fluctuating ) magnetic moments . to account for both contributions ,",
    "the lf-@xmath3sr  data were fitted by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : osc_008 ] ) , where the stretched exponential term can accommodate different situations .",
    "indeed , the stretching coefficient @xmath48 can assume a value @xmath54 , indicating a gaussian relaxation process ( with the implanted muons probing quasi - static electronic moments with short - range magnetic correlations ) , or @xmath55 , indicating a _ single _ spin - spin autocorrelation time for the entire electronic spin system .",
    "the case @xmath56 , instead , is typical of broad inhomogeneous _ distributions _ of dynamic ( i.e. , fluctuating ) local fields ( or relaxation rates ) , which can be due to randomness , disorder , or frustration , as e.g. , in the case of spin glasses",
    ".    figures  [ fig : fig7](b ) and [ fig : fig9](c ) , which report the evolution of the @xmath48 parameter with temperature and lf field , respectively , show similar features : @xmath48 exhibits a broad minimum at about @xmath57 , where it assumes the value 0.6 .",
    "then , for temperatures below 20 k , where the magnetic moments in the feas planes become static , it grows back again to ca",
    ".  1 . also @xmath58 shows a broad minimum centered in the 0.050.1 t field range , where the longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath40 has a narrow peak reflecting the competition between the static and dynamic components of the local field at the muon site . for applied fields above 75 mt ,",
    "the @xmath59-dependence of the longitudinal relaxation rate is no more due to decoupling , but is determined only by the long - lived local field fluctuations .",
    "this fact is confirmed by the slow recovery of the longitudinal muon - asymmetry component .",
    "a similar behavior was observed also in tb@xmath60sn@xmath21o@xmath61,@xcite where the occurrence of such a peak was attributed to the inapplicability of the redfield relaxation model and , consequently , reported as evidence of a broad distribution of spin - spin correlation times .    from these observations",
    "we argue that in the 2040k temperature interval the local magnetism shows a spin - glass character , most likely due to the proximity of the magnetic transition at @xmath62k .",
    "consequently , in this @xmath45 range one can tentatively use the same approach valid for spin - glass systems .",
    "this will allow us to discuss the relation between the longitudinal - field data and the dynamic spin fluctuations occurring in the magnetic phase .",
    "to this aim we recall that the relaxation at long times probes the spin - fluctuation dynamics and , in absence of cross - correlations ( as is the case for spin glasses ) , the relaxation rate is just the fourier transform of the dynamic spin - spin autocorrelation function , @xmath63 .",
    "when the spin - glass transition is approached from above , @xmath64 exhibits either a power - law ( pl ) , @xmath65 , or a stretched - exponential ( se ) dependence , @xmath66.@xcite since in our case the magnetic transition is quite broad ( see @xmath4 data in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] ) , we can use the same theoretical approach valid in spin glasses .",
    "the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function , @xmath67 , leads then to a time - field scaling of the @xmath3sr asymmetry @xmath68 , where @xmath69 for power - law and @xmath70 for stretched - exponential correlations.@xcite this scaling stops being valid at high fields , where @xmath64 is directly affected by the applied lf field , typically for @xmath71 , a limit which is never reached in our case .    as a next step",
    ", one can try to establish the nature of the spin - spin correlation function and , from this , the nature of the dynamic component of the relaxation . by using the same method adopted in spin - glass systems , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] we display the time - dependent asymmetry as a function of the scaled variable @xmath72 . to exclude from this analysis the effects of the static component of the local field at the muon site , we removed the short - time data ( i.e. , @xmath73@xmath3s ) .",
    "( color online ) .",
    "muon asymmetry data taken at @xmath44  k in the @xmath41 sample in various applied longitudinal fields vs.  the scaled variable @xmath74 , with @xmath75 for @xmath41.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    with a value of @xmath75 the @xmath76-dependent muon asymmetries obtained at different fields overlap over almost two orders of magnitude in @xmath77@xcite , except for very low field values , where the static local field is expected to dominate .",
    "since the scaling exponent @xmath78 is lower than one , it suggests that at the @xmath3sr  time scale the spin - spin correlation function @xmath64 is best approximated by a power law , rather than by a stretched exponential , hence suggesting a picture of _ cooperative critical spin fluctuations _ rather than a distribution of local fluctuation rates .",
    "this finding seems in marked contrast with the field- and temperature - behavior of the stretched exponential parameter , @xmath79 , which hints at a broad inhomogeneous distribution of the local magnetic fluctuation rates .",
    "the scenario of an inhomogeneous sample is , nevertheless , very unlikely : ( i ) the presence of a peak in @xmath80 at about 30k , that should be absent in a fully disordered system ; ( ii ) at @xmath44k not less than 70% of the sample volume shows static ordered magnetism , and ( iii ) as suggested by the x - ray analysis and confirmed by a rather sharp superconducting transition ( relative to this family ) , the @xmath4 sample is expected to be fairly homogeneous .",
    "therefore , as in the case of cefepo,@xcite the sizable dynamic component evidenced in our sample most likely reflects a cooperative scenario .",
    "+ interestingly , the critical slowing down of spin fluctuations occurs at sufficiently low temperatures , i.e. , at @xmath81k , where both the static magnetism and the superconductivity occur over the whole sample volume .",
    "unfortunately , we have no means of distinguishing whether the dynamic component can be related to the superconducting state or , most likely , it reflects a glassy magnetic phase .",
    "+ finally , we remark that the disordered magnetic phase seems a constant feature of the m - sc crossover region of the iron - based superconductors that was observed , for instance , also in iron chalcogenides at intermediate se - te substitutions.@xcite this type of short - range ( disordered ) magnetism could be driven by orbital nematic correlations induced by the tendency towards ordering of the iron 3@xmath82 orbitals.@xcite to address this fundamental issue and unveil the true nature of the disordered magnetic phase , a systematic study of the structural and of the in - plane transport properties vs.  temperature on high quality ndfeaso@xmath1f@xmath2  single crystals should be seriously considered .",
    "in this work we reported on the evolution with f - doping of the magnetic and superconducting properties of the nd1111 family . we have shown that its electronic phase diagram presents similar features to other compounds of the ln1111 family ( ln = la , sm , ce ) .",
    "in particular , at low doping ( @xmath83 ) a long - range antiferromagnetic order sets in for @xmath84 . at intermediate doping ( @xmath85 )",
    "a short - range magnetic order develops which , at low temperature , coexists with bulk superconductivity on a nanometer length scale .",
    "finally , at high f - doping values ( @xmath86 ) , only the superconductivity survives , with no relevant traces of any magnetic order .",
    "contrary to the other ln1111 cases , in the intermediate f - doping regime of nd1111 , we find clear evidence of fluctuating magnetism on the @xmath3sr  time scale . this _ dynamic _ magnetic component persists down to low temperature , until a short - range _ static _ magnetism and superconductivity develop over the whole sample volume .",
    "this peculiarity of nd1111 seems to be related to the glassy nature of its magnetically ordered phase at intermediate temperatures , i.e. , just below the average nel temperature .",
