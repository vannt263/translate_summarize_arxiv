    "the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) theory of simple atoms like hydrogen or hydrogen - like ions provides precise predictions for different energy levels @xcite .",
    "particularly , some accurate results were obtained for the lamb shift in the ground state of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the accuracy of the qed calculations of the lamb shift has been limited by unknown higher - order two - loop corrections and inaccuracy of determination of the proton charge radius @xcite .",
    "as far as the proton size is going to be determined very precisely from a new experiment @xcite on the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen , the only theoretical uncertainty is now due to the two - loop contribution .",
    "improvement of the theory is important to determine the rydberg constant with high accuracy @xcite and to test the bound state qed precisely .    since the theory seems not to be able to give now any results on higher - order two - loop corrections ( @xmath0 and higher ) we have to look for another way to estimate these terms and so the uncertainty of the hydrogen lamb shift theory .",
    "an opportunity is to study the problem experimentally , measuring the lamb shift in different hydrogen - like ions at not too high value of the nuclear charge @xmath1 . only for two such ions the lamb shift can be available with a high accuracy from experiment at the present time or in the near future .",
    "namely , these are helium @xcite and nitrogen @xcite ions .",
    "the experimental estimation of higher - order two - loop terms is quite of interest also because of recent speculation on a great higher - order term @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath2 is determined by the scaling behaviour of different qed values :    * the scaling of the lamb shift is @xmath3 ; * the scaling of the radiative line width of excited states ( e. g. of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states ) is @xmath3 as well ; * the scaling of the unknown higher - order two - loop corrections to the lamb shift is @xmath6 .",
    "thus , relatively imprecise measurements with higher @xmath1 can nevertheless give some quite accurate data on some qed corrections .",
    "our target is to develop a theory for the lamb shift and the fine structure in these two atomic systems .",
    "eventually we need to determine the @xmath7 splitting in the helium ion ( for comparison with the experiment @xcite ) , difference of the lamb shifts @xmath8 in @xmath9he@xmath10 ( for the project @xcite ) and the @xmath11 interval in hydrogen - like nitrogen .",
    "the difference mentioned is necessary @xcite if one needs to compare the results of the lamb shift ( @xmath12 ) measurement @xcite and the @xmath13 experiment .    since the uncertainty of the qed calculations",
    "is determined for these two ions ( he@xmath10 and n@xmath14 ) by the higher - order two - loop terms , we are going to reduce the other sources of uncertainty .",
    "we present results appropriate to provide an interpretation of the experiments mentioned as a direct study of the higher - order two loop corrections .",
    "the results of the ions experiments should afterwards be useful for the hydrogen atom .",

    "the dimensionless dirac energy of the electron in the external coulomb field is of the form @xmath19    the lamb shift is mainly a qed effect , perturbed by the influence of the nuclear structure @xmath20 the qed contribution @xmath21 includes one- , two- and three - loop terms calculated within the external - field approximation @xmath22\\,,\\ ] ] and a recoil corrections @xmath23 , which is a sum of pure recoil and radiative recoil contributions depending on the nuclear mass @xmath16 @xmath24      let us start with the one - loop contribution .",
    "the terms of the external - field contribution are usually written in the form of an expansion @xmath25 the dominant contribution comes from the one - loop self energy of the electron .",
