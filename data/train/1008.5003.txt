    "in @xcite , gabai defines knot width and thin position as a measure of the complexity of various morse functions on a given knot in @xmath0 .",
    "one important aspect of thin position is that it yields an embedding of a given knot that is minimal with respect to certain types of isotopies . in @xcite , schultens defines the width complex of a knot in order to better understand these isotopies and the various positions a given knot can occupy in @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , she asks the following two questions : + * question 12 . *",
    "_ can the width complex of a knot have local minima that are not global minima ? _ + * question 13 .",
    "* _ is every vertex of the width complex of a knot connected to one of the global minima of this complex by a monotonically decreasing path ? _",
    "+ schultens also defines a similar width complex for 3-manifolds , and her theorem 13 from @xcite provides a positive answer to the 3-manifold version of question 12 , namely that there exist 3-manifolds whose width complexes contain local minima that are not global minima . on the other hand , combining the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we see that if @xmath3 is @xmath0 or a lens space , then the width complex of @xmath3 has a unique minimum , corresponding to a minimal genus heegaard splitting .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to expect that the simplest knots might share this property .",
    "this is further suggested by otal s proof that non - minimal bridge positions of the unknot and 2-bridge knots are stabilized @xcite and ozawa s recent proof of the same statement for torus knots @xcite .",
    "+ schultens compares question 13 to one answered by goeritz in 1934 .",
    "goeritz produced a nontrivial diagram of the unknot @xmath1 such that any reidemeister move increases the diagram s crossing number .",
    "we find an analogous result concerning the width complex of @xmath1 , finding a nontrivial embedding such that any isotopy must increase the complexity of the embedding , the difference being that in this context complexity refers to knot width instead of crossing number . as a result",
    ", we give an affirmative answer to schultens first question , which shows that the answer to the second question must be no .",
    "in fact , we show the surprising and much stronger result that for every knot @xmath2 , the width complex of @xmath2 has infinitely many local minima that are not global minima .",
    "let @xmath2 be a knot in @xmath0 , and fix a morse function @xmath4 such that @xmath5 has exactly two critical points .",
    "we can think of @xmath2 as an equivalence class , denoted @xmath6 , of the set of embeddings of @xmath7 into @xmath0 modulo ambient isotopy . in the usual definition of knot width ,",
    "the embedding of @xmath2 is fixed and the morse function @xmath5 is allowed to vary up to isotopy ; however , this definition is equivalent with the one that follows .",
    "let @xmath8 such that @xmath9 is morse , and let @xmath10 be the critical levels of @xmath11 .",
    "choose regular levels @xmath12 , and define @xmath13 now , let @xmath14 the invariant @xmath15 is called the width of @xmath2 , and if @xmath8 satisfies @xmath16 , we say that @xmath17 is a thin position for @xmath2 .",
    "+ for our purposes it will be useful to split an embedding @xmath17 into thick and thin levels .",
    "for @xmath18 , we say that a regular value @xmath19 of @xmath9 corresponds to a thick level @xmath20 if @xmath21 .",
    "likewise , @xmath19 corresponds to a thin level @xmath20 if @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath32 cobounds a disk @xmath43 with @xmath33 such that @xmath43 has no critical points in its interior , and we call @xmath43 a _ strict upper disk for @xmath17 at @xmath34_. for any @xmath44 , the highest maximum of @xmath11 , we have that @xmath45 ) \\cap k$ ] consists of arcs @xmath30 , which cobound pairwise disjoint strict upper disks with arcs @xmath38 contained in @xmath46 .",

    "thus , from this point forward we will ( under slight abuse of notation ) let @xmath57 denote the set of embeddings isotopic to @xmath2 up to this equivalence .",
    "now , we use the set @xmath6 and pairs of strict upper and lower disks to define the width complex of @xmath2 , a directed graph @xmath58 whose vertices correspond to elements of @xmath57 . we first make several definitions :    suppose that @xmath8 .",

    ", we call this a _ type i move_. if @xmath17 has a weakly reducible thick surface @xmath34 , we can again slide @xmath17 along the pair @xmath59 to move a minimum of @xmath17 above a maximum of @xmath17 .",
    "this changes @xmath17 to @xmath62 such that @xmath64 , and we call this a _ type ii move_. in either case , we call @xmath59 a _ pair of reducing disks _ at @xmath34 and we make an directed edge from @xmath17 to @xmath52 in @xmath58 . the next theorem , theorem 1 from @xcite , is important to our understanding of the width complex :    the width complex of a knot is connected .",
    "this theorem says that given @xmath65 , there is a series of level isotopies and type i and type ii moves taking @xmath17 to @xmath52 .",
    "schulten s width complex also contains higher dimensional cells , but we need only consider the one - skeleton of the complex in this context .",
    "we call @xmath8 a _ local minimum _ of the width complex if there are no directed edges leaving @xmath17 in @xmath58 .    the position @xmath17 is called a local minimum because any isotopy that changes @xmath17 to @xmath62 must increase @xmath15",
    ". let @xmath66 denote the set of local minima of the width complex of @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear that any thin position @xmath17 for @xmath2 must come from @xmath67 ; otherwise there is an isotopy decreasing @xmath68 .",
    "we also have the following , the proof of which is clear from the definition of the width complex :    [ mini ] an element @xmath8 is in @xmath67 if and only if every thick level of @xmath17 is strongly irreducible .    using the definitions of this section",
    ", we can reformulate schulten s questions as follows : + * question 12 .",
    "* _ is there a knot @xmath2 with @xmath69 such that @xmath70 ? _ + * question 13 . * _ given @xmath8 , is there a directed path in @xmath58 starting at @xmath17 and ending at a thin position for @xmath2 ? _ + explicitly , a directed path is a sequence of vertices @xmath71 such that each there is a directed edge from @xmath72 to @xmath73 for each @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the unknot in @xmath0 , and let @xmath8 be the position of the unknot depicted in figure 1 , where @xmath5 is the standard height projection onto a vertical axis .",
    "[ unkn ]   of the unknot , shown with thick / thin levels , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=55.0% ]    we will label the thick / thin levels of @xmath17 as @xmath75 , as shown .",
    "first , we need several results about bridge position .    for any knot @xmath2 with embedding @xmath17 ,",
    "the bridge number of @xmath17 , @xmath76 , is defined to be the number of maxima in @xmath17 with respect to @xmath5 , and the bridge number of @xmath2 , @xmath77 , is the minimum of @xmath76 over @xmath8 .",
    "we call @xmath17 a _ bridge position _ for @xmath2 if @xmath78 and @xmath17 has exactly one thick level , called a bridge sphere for @xmath17 .",
    "schultens shows in @xcite that the bridge number of any @xmath79-cable of a 2-bridge knot is @xmath80 , and we demonstrate in @xcite that any thin position is a bridge position for such a knot . in this case",
    ", the bridge sphere must be strongly irreducible .",
    "we will use this fact in the following :    [ unknot ] the pictured embedding @xmath17 of the unknot is a local minimum in the width complex .    by lemma [ mini ]",
    ", it suffices to show that every thick surface of @xmath17 is strongly irreducible .",
    "observe that the thick surfaces @xmath81 are identical except for the extra vertical segments contained in @xmath39 and @xmath82 .",
    "thus , we need only show that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are strongly irreducible .",
    "+ * claim 1 * : @xmath83 is strongly irreducible .",
    "suppose not .",
    "then there is a pair of reducing disks @xmath59 at @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath85 denote the regular value corresponding to the thin level @xmath86 .",

    "thus , the pair @xmath59 of reducing disks at @xmath83 is also a pair of reducing disks at the bridge sphere @xmath83 of the trefoil s cable , a contradiction to the fact that this cable is in thin position .",

    "this contradicts the fact that @xmath105 is not the unlink ( see for instance , @xcite , section 5e ) .",

    "thus , every thick surface of @xmath17 is strongly irreducible , and by lemma [ mini ] , @xmath17 represents a local minimum in the width complex of @xmath117 . for instance , consider the projection of the figure eight @xmath118 knot shown in figure 4 .",
