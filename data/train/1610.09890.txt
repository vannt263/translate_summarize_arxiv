    "the role of environment in the triggering of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is a topic that has received much attention in the literature .",
    "one reason is that , because we understand that interactions and mergers may lead to gas inflow and hence accretion onto a central massive black hole , there has been a general expectation that agn should exist in denser environments than inactive galaxies .",
    "however , finding such a link has proven to be difficult and any relations between agn and environment are weak .",
    "@xcite summarize some specific issues that may contribute to the lack of a clear consensus .",
    "they point out that there are many definitions of ` environment ' , which may be local or large scale , including ( i ) a high local density of neighbours , ( ii ) membership of a group or cluster and the relative location within that group or cluster , and ( iii ) galaxy - galaxy interactions ( e.g. pairs ) .",
    "they also note that the environmental dependence may differ according to agn luminosity and whether the physical feeding mechanism is radiatively efficient ( e.g. x - ray and optical samples ) or not ( e.g. low excitation radio samples ) .",
    "an additional complication is the short timescale variability of agn @xcite , which implies that comparing agn to a control sample may completely remove any relation between the agn and the phenomenon being studied .",
    "as described by @xcite , a simple way to understand this intuitively is to hypothesize that , for example , gas inflow is triggered at some point in every galaxy that is part of a group . over a gyr timescale , inflow will occur at different times in different galaxies , perhaps more than once . in any snapshot",
    ", one sees only a random subset of active galaxies , which will be different for another snapshot .",
    "one might conclude from a snapshot that agn fuelling is related to the group environment ; but since at any given time many galaxies in the group are inactive , the conclusion from using a control sample would be that it is not , contradicting the original hypothesis .",
    "a way to avoid this problem could be to look at the incidence of agn activity as a function of environment , for example as was done by @xcite . with a sample of 10 groups and 6 clusters , they find that the fraction of agn ( with @xmath0ergs@xmath1 ) in groups is a factor 2 higher than in clusters , although the result has marginal significance .",
    "due to concerns about the differing morphological mix of galaxies in these different environments , they also looked at the agn fraction in early type galaxies , finding a similar result .",
    "many other studies of the environment of x - ray selected agn have used correlation analysis to assess the clustering bias on different scales as well as the typical halo mass .",
    "recent examples include @xcite who found a strong clustering signal for agn with median @xmath2 and @xmath3ergs@xmath1 .",
    "the correlation length matched that of galaxies with stellar mass @xmath4m@xmath5 , and implied a typical halo mass of @xmath6m@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite found that agn ( @xmath7ergs@xmath8 \\la 10^{44}$ ] ) typically reside in haloes of mass @xmath9m@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite found similar halo masses for the infrared selected agn they studied at @xmath10 , with @xmath11m@xmath5 and  @xmath12m@xmath5 depending on whether the agn are obscured or not .",
    "these papers highlight that the luminosity , selection technique , and redshift of an agn population are also important factors in assessing environment . indeed ,",
    "@xcite show that at @xmath131.5 there may be a reversal in the incidence of agn in clusters versus the field .",
    "more locally , using a large number of galaxies from the sdss , with agn identified via their [ oiii ] line emission , @xcite found little difference between the clustering of agn and control galaxies on scales greater than 1mpc , suggesting that the halos of active and inactive galaxies have similar masses .",
    "between 100kpc and 1mpc agn were more weakly clustered , a result these authors argued could be explained if agn are preferentially located at the centres of their haloes . and at scales less than 70kpc",
    ", agn appeared to be marginally more clustered .    in our analysis here , we use a complementary technique to the correlation analyses above .",
    "we use existing group catalogues to assess environment , and look simply at the sizes of the groups ( i.e. halo occupation number , which is related to halo mass ) in which local , moderately luminous agn are found .",
    "we make use of the very hard x - ray selected agn in the _ swift bat _",
    "catalogue , noting that @xcite found a higher fraction of interactions and close pairs of galaxies than in the general galaxy population .",
    "in contrast , @xcite have argued that the availability of cold gas in the nuclear regions , rather than local galaxy density or galaxy - galaxy interactions , is the key driver for agn activity and luminosity .",
    "we fold this issue into our analysis by looking at the environmental dependence separately for the two most common types of host galaxy , spirals and lenticulars . in doing so , we build on the work of @xcite and @xcite , who discuss secular inflow and external accretion in disk - dominated and bulge - dominated hosts .",
    "in addition to their own sample , these authors made use of published integral field spectroscopy data of agn with matched inactive samples @xcite . comparing",
    "the spatially resolved stellar and gas kinematics , they found that the presence of gas and its co- versus counter- rotation with respect to the stars was consistent with secular inflow from the host galaxy for agn in spirals but with accretion from the environment for s0 galaxies .",
    "similar misalignments between the stellar and molecular gas kinematics have also been reported for two early type liners @xcite . however , these authors could not probe the environment itself .",
    "that is our aim in this paper , to test whether the environmental dependence differs for agn in spirals versus s0 hosts .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : sample ] we describe the sample of agn we use and the group catalogues with which we cross - correlate them .",
    "the analysis itself is the focus of sec .",
    "[ sec : z0.04 ] . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : lumfunc ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : obsc ] we discuss the additional topics of luminosity function and obscured fraction , that one may expect to differ if the environmental dependence of agn activity depends itself on the host galaxy .",
    "we then finish with a summary of our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the sample of agn we study is related to the llama ( local luminous agn with matched analogues ) sample described in @xcite , who also give a detailed description of the selection and the rationale for it .",
    "the key aspect is that these are selected from the all - sky flux limited 14195kev 58-month _ swift bat _ survey in such a way as to create a volume limited sample of active galaxies that is as unbiassed as possible , for detailed study using high resolution spectroscopy and adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy .",
    "the sole selection criteria were @xmath14 ( corresponding to a distance of @xmath15mpc ) , @xmath16ergs@xmath8 > 42.5 $ ] ( using redshift distance ) , and @xmath17 so that they are observable from the vlt .",
    "this yielded 20 agn .",
    "a set of inactive galaxies were selected to match in terms of host galaxy type , mass ( using h - band luminosity as a proxy ) , inclination , presence of a bar , and distance .",
    "while this sample is sufficient for detailed studies of the molecular and ionised gas kinematics and distributions , as well as the stellar kinematics and populations , in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions , it is not sufficient for a statistical analysis of the type discussed in this paper .    in order to increase the number of agn for the purposes of the study here , we go beyond the llama sample while keeping as close as possible to the original ideal .",
    "we therefore select all agn at @xmath18 with @xmath16ergs@xmath8 > 42.5 $ ] in the 70-month catalogue @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : batplot ] .",
    "in addition we have excluded two objects for which the counterparts were mis - identified and are at redshift higher than our threshold , and included a number of additional sources that meet our criteria as given in ricci et al .",
    "( in prep . ) and @xcite .",
    "this yields 350 agn .",
    "this sample is no longer volume limited but otherwise imposes no additional bias compared to the llama sample .",
    "an obvious concern would be that the large number of more distant agn that are excluded because they are below the survey flux limit , may impose a redshift bias on the distribution of host galaxy morphology . in order to address this ,",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ subsec : groupcats ] for the specific context of host galaxy morphological classification , that there is no bias with respect to redshift .              to assess the environment we cross - correlate the agn with two group / cluster catalogues , which are both based largely on the 2mass redshift survey @xcite of galaxies brighter than @xmath19 but in which the groupings are defined in completely different ways .",
    "using two independent catalogues based on the same set of galaxies allows us to minimise the impact of any bias from the way the groups are defined , and better assess the uncertainties .",
    "the first catalogue is that of @xcite , which is based on a friends - of - friends algorithm with additional refinement procedures , applied to a combined catalogue of galaxies from several surveys of the local universe .",
    "since the galaxy identifications are based on the pgc catalogue ( @xcite , constituting the framework of the hyperleda database ) , we have adopted the host galaxy morphological classifications given in the pgc catalogue . of the selected agn",
    ", we find 199 in the @xcite catalogue that also have morphological host galaxy classifications .",
    "the second catalogue is that of @xcite , for which groups were constructed using an iterative method in which initial halos are defined according to scaling relations , and then overlapping halos are assigned to a single group halo . host galaxy morphological classifications from @xcite are given in the data tables of this catalogue , and so we use those . in a comparison of their catalogue to this one",
    ", @xcite pointed out that the groups are only reliable to @xmath20 .",
    "we have therefore limited our analysis with the @xcite catalogue to that redshift , leaving 229 agn with both group classifications and host classifications . as comparison samples",
    "we take all the galaxies that have morphological identifications in each group catalogue to the same redshift limit .",
    "this yields about 23500 and 27000 objects with host classifications in the @xcite and @xcite group catalogues respectively .    in order to confirm that there is no major difference in galaxy mass between the active and comparison samples , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : hlum ] the h - band luminosity calculated from the j - h and j - k colours and k - band luminosity given by @xcite . the h - band luminosity can be used as a proxy for stellar mass since the uncertainty in the h - band mass - to - light ratio is about 0.2dex ( @xcite , using masses from @xcite ) . for the agn hosts we find a median luminosity of @xmath21 = 10.7 $ ] with a distribution of @xmath22dex ; while for the galaxies as a whole we find @xmath21 = 10.5 $ ] with @xmath23dex .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have used threshold column of n@xmath25 and n@xmath26 to indicate an absorbed agn , since these correspond to optical classifications of sy2and sy1.8 respectively for defining optically obscured agn ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    bearing this in mind , for the purposes of this study , we consider seyfert  11.5 as unobscured and seyfert  1.82 to be obscured .",
    "table  [ tab : obsc ] reports the fractions of obscured and unobscured seyferts in spiral and s0 hosts .",
    "since some fraction of the agn have unclear or multiple classifications ( here referred to as ` other ' ) , we also show in parentheses the fraction of obscured and unobscured seyferts excluding those .",
    "an independent assessment of the same physical phenomenon can be found by looking at the fractions of x - ray absorbed and unabsorbed agn in the different hosts .",
    "we have used absorbing columns derived through a consistent analysis of the 0.3150kev band by ricci et al .",
    "( in prep . ) and @xcite , who provide the details for the modelling of the x - ray spectra . in our analysis",
    "we have excluded blazars since the n@xmath27 measured in these objects may be affected by the extended x - ray emission from the jet .",
    "we have used two threshold column densities of 10@xmath28@xmath29 and 10@xmath30@xmath29 to define absorbed agn , since these correspond approximately to thresholds of sy2 and sy1.8 in definitions of optical obscuration @xcite .",
    "the absorbed and unabsorbed fractions are shown in table  [ tab : xabs ] .",
    "both optical obscuration and x - ray absorption show the same general trend .",
    "for the luminosity range considered here , agn in disk galaxies are consistent with an equal split between unobscured and obscured or equivalently unabsorbed and absorbed",
    ". however the fraction of obscured or absorbed agn in s0 galaxies appears to be higher at about a 2@xmath31 level of significance .",
    "if agn in s0 hosts are fuelled by externally accreted gas , then that gas could provide a source of obscuration towards the nucleus , that is additional to the gas internal to the galaxy on small scales .",
    "since much of the nuclear obscuration is expected to occur on small scales , on might expect that the additional obscuration on large scales should make only a minor difference to the obscured fraction .",
    "however , this is a marginal result and so we consider it as indicative rather than robust .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the environment , host type , and luminosity distribution for about 200 agn selected from the _ swift bat _ hard x - ray survey according to @xmath16ergs@xmath8 > 42.5 $ ] and @xmath18 .",
    "to do so , we have used two independent group catalogues which are based on similar galaxy surveys but with the groups defined in different ways .",
    "the main conclusions are :    * our data support the emerging consensus that the typical halo mass of local x - ray selected agn is of order @xmath32m@xmath5 , corresponding to a typical group size of not more than a few galaxies .",
    "however , we also caution that this is most likely a consequence of the fact that most galaxies ( at the sensitivity of current all - sky galaxy catalogues ) are in such haloes . * most hard x - ray selected agn",
    "are in spiral galaxies , and these show no evidence for an environmental dependence ( although our data do not rule out a dependence ) .",
    "we argue that this is because the galaxies have their own internal gas supply which is sufficient to fuel an agn . *",
    "the fraction of s0 hosts with an agn decreases in large groups and clusters ( in contrast to the fraction of s0 galaxies itself , which , as expected for the well established morphology density relation , increases in denser environments ) .",
    "we argue that this is because agn in s0 hosts are fuelled by gas from the environment that falls into the galaxy . while this is possible in small groups , gas in an intra - cluster medium",
    "is ionised and so can not be accreted onto the galaxy efficiently .",
    "* there is a difference in the luminosity functions of agn in bulge - dominated and disk - dominated galaxies , with the latter having significantly more lower luminosity agn .",
    "this can be understood in the context of their relative bulge sizes and the @xmath33 relation .",
    "* there is some evidence that the fraction of obscured agn is higher in s0 galaxies than spirals .",
    "if confirmed , this could be due to the importance of external accretion for fuelling agn in s0 hosts , which implies the presence of gas and dust in the group environment around the galaxy that could lead to additional obscuration .",
