    "radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) are models of black hole accretion at rates much smaller than the eddington rate . in this regime , numerous physical effects reduce the ability of the infalling gas to radiate , thereby robbing accretion of its capacity to convert gravitational energy into light .",
    "for example , in an early riaf model known as an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) the gas density is low enough that the electrons and ions thermally decouple ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , so that the accretion energy is carried by the ions into the black hole with little escaping as radiation @xcite .",
    "later work found that these low density flows resulted in gas that is unstable to large radial circulations @xcite and only marginally bound to the black hole @xcite .",
    "thus , given a tiny perturbation , only a fraction of the gas that is fed to the outer regions of the accretion flow will actually successfully fall into the black hole , further reducing the radiative efficiency .",
    "the benchmark against which all riaf models are tested is the black hole at the center of the galaxy , sgr a * , which radiates at @xmath0 of its eddington luminosity , and has a well determined spectral energy distribution from radio wavelengths to x - ray energies in both quiescent and flaring states @xcite .",
    "several different riaf models fit the spectrum of sgr a *  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in different solutions to the desired physical parameters such as the run of temperature , magnetic field strength , and density with radius .",
    "the constraints tightened when @xcite reported the tentative detection of linear polarization in the sub - millimeter spectrum of sgr a*. @xcite and @xcite then showed that the higher density adaf solutions would likely depolarize any emission in this wavelength range , and speculated that only the hotter , more tenuous models are viable candidates .",
    "now , with several successful observations , linear polarization measurements are being used to constrain the accretion rate and density profile of the flow onto sgr a *  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paper discusses how the relativistic plasma in riaf solutions will effect the polarization properties of any propagating radiation .",
    "in particular , we show that observations of both linear and circular polarization at multiple frequencies can provide important constraints on many of the key predictions of riafs .",
    "radiation propagating through a plasma pierced by a uniform external magnetic field will travel via two wave modes that have orthogonal polarizations and different phase velocities .",
    "the polarization properties of the radiation are thus altered as it passes through the medium .",
    "the best known example of this effect is faraday rotation , where a linearly polarized wave has its plane of polarization rotated during passage through a cold ( i.e. , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electron temperature and mass ) plasma with circularly polarized normal modes . in general , however , both the plasma modes and radiation have elliptical polarizations giving rise to generalized faraday rotation .",
    "an effective way to visualize the result of this general case is to construct a three - dimensional space using the stokes parameters as the cartesian coordinates @xmath5 .",
    "the unit sphere in this space is the poincar  sphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is shown in figure  [ fig : sphere ] .",
    "the surface of this sphere denotes all possible polarizations of the radiation and plasma wave modes .",
    "the poles and the equator of the sphere indicate either pure circular or linear polarization , respectively .",
    "the two orthogonal normal modes of a plasma are found as a line passing through the center of the sphere and one mode is drawn as the vector @xmath6 in figure  [ fig : sphere ] .",
    "a polarized light ray @xmath7 passing through this medium will rotate around the wave mode at a constant angle ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphere ] as the circle on the sphere s surface ) changing its polarization properties .",
    "the amount of this generalized faraday rotation depends on the relative orientation between the polarization vector of the propagating radiation and of the normal modes of the intervening medium .",
    "the precession of the polarization vector can be analyzed by decomposing it into one component , @xmath8 , that is parallel to @xmath6 and one component , @xmath9 that is perpendicular to it .",
    "the parallel component is unaffected by the propagation through the medium , whereas the perpendicular component undergoes rapid rotation on the plane perpendicular to @xmath6 , which results in a cyclic conversion between linear and circular polarization @xcite .",
    "this mechanism for generating circular polarization has long been considered as a possible origin for the observed circular polarization from radio quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it also has been applied to sgr a *  in the context of a jet emission model @xcite .    in a cold plasma",
    "the wave modes are coincident with the poles , so polarized radiation will rotate around a line of constant latitude on the sphere resulting in the classical faraday rotation .",
    "if such a cold plasma produces a large number of rotations around the normal modes ( i.e. , it has a large rotation measure ) , then the radiation may be linearly depolarized as the linear polarized vectors are averaged out over different lines of sight .",
    "interestingly , this does not occur for generalized faraday rotation .",
    "even if the perpendicular component of the polarization vector suffers very large rotations around @xmath6 , the emerging radiation will still have a net elliptical polarization described by the component @xmath8 of the incident radiation parallel to the normal mode .",
    "therefore , there will always remain some linearly polarized component to the radiation and it is not generally true that a large rotation measure will lead to a linearly depolarized signal .    to begin to identify the polarization signatures of a riaf we first must calculate the ellipticity of the normal modes in the accretion flow . the axial ratio of the elliptical wave modes in a plasma can be written as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath10^{1/2 } \\over      { 2i\\alpha^{12}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the plasma dielectric tensor and @xmath12 .",
    "the components of @xmath13 are functions of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the frequency of the propagating radiation .",
    "the general expression for @xmath16 for a thermal magnetized plasma of any temperature was derived by @xcite , and can be expressed in an analytic form in either the very low temperature ( @xmath1 ) or very high temperature ( @xmath17 ) limit .",
    "if @xmath18 or @xmath19 , then the wave modes are linear and lie along the equator of the poincar  sphere , and significant conversion between linear and circular polarization will occur . if @xmath20 then the modes are circular and only standard faraday rotation is possible .",
    "examination of equation  [ eq : t ] shows that the key parameter in determining the axial ratio of the linear modes is @xmath21 . for a plasma that has both a cold component with number density @xmath22 and a relativistic ( @xmath23 ) component with density @xmath24 then @xcite @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is",
    "the angle between the magnetic field and the direction of propagation , and @xmath28 is the cyclotron frequency of an electron in a magnetic field of strength @xmath29 .",
    "these two expressions are valid only for @xmath30 . for a non - relativistic plasma ,",
    "the wave modes are independent of temperature , so the @xmath31 in equations  [ eq : a11minusa22 ] and  [ eq : a12 ] refers to the temperature of the relativistic plasma .",
    "consider now a thermal plasma with a temperature @xmath32 that can range from non - relativistic to ultra - relativistic , such as within an riaf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we can use the above equations to determine how the wave modes of this plasma will vary with temperature and thus its effects on polarized radiation . without loss of generality",
    ", the distribution of energies in this plasma can be written using the relativistic maxwellian : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the lorentz factor , @xmath35 is the electron velocity in units of @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the modified bessel function . for any value of the electron temperature",
    ", a critical lorentz factor @xmath38 can be defined , above which a fraction of this plasma will always be considered ultra - relativistic . integrating equation  [ eq : maxwell ] above @xmath38 allows us to split the thermal plasma into a relativistic component with density @xmath24 and a cold component with density @xmath39 .",
    "re - defining @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the mean energy of the plasma above @xmath38 , the three quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 can all be calculated as functions of the electron temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : vskt ] shows the result of such a calculation and plots the axial ratio of the normal modes @xmath44 as a function of plasma temperature for an observed frequency of 100  ghz and a magnetic field of 100  g.    a value of @xmath45 was used for this and all subsequent calculations .",
    "while approximations have been made to obtain this result , we see the expected behavior that the modes are purely circular ( @xmath46 ) for temperatures @xmath47 .",
    "it is in this regime that adafs reside ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and so they will only cause classical faraday rotation .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig : vskt ] shows the value of @xmath44 assuming a magnetic field that is tilted at @xmath48 to the direction of propagation , while the dashed line shows the results when @xmath49 and the dotted line denotes @xmath50 . at low values of the electron temperature ,",
    "the magnetic field geometry is practically irrelevant with the modes remaining nearly purely circular .",
    "in contrast , for a thermal plasma with a temperature @xmath51 , the modes are elliptical resulting in generalized faraday rotation .",
    "when the temperature climbs to values so that @xmath52 , the wave modes become linear ( @xmath18 ) and radiation may undergo significant conversion between linear and circular polarization .",
    "the magnetic field geometry has a large influence when the modes are elliptical .",
    "when the field is closely aligned to the direction of propagation , @xmath27 is small and the modes remain circular up to larger temperatures , increasing the importance of faraday rotation .",
    "however , when the field is nearly perpendicular to the direction of propagation , @xmath27 is large , increasing the ellipticity of the wave modes and the importance of conversion .",
    "both semi - analytic and numerical simulations of riafs models predict relativistic electron temperatures in the inner part of the accretion flows @xcite .",
    "therefore , the wave modes will be elliptically polarized and generalized faraday rotation will be important .",
    "linear polarization has been observed from sgr a *  in the sub - millimeter range of the spectrum @xcite . at these frequencies ,",
    "the emission originates from synchrotron emitting thermal electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the emission is optically thick and the synchrotron emissivity is a very steep function of radius @xcite , each frequency can be mapped to a specific emission radius in the accretion flow .",
    "sub - millimeter vlbi observations have resolved the image of sgr a *  at a few wavelengths @xcite , allowing a tentative calibration of the radius - frequency relation @xcite : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and a distance of 8  kpc has been assumed to sgr a*. @xcite have used this relation and the observed spectrum of sgr a *  to estimate the run of the electron temperature and magnetic field strength with radius : @xmath56 and @xmath57  g , where @xmath58 is a factor of order unity which we take to be @xmath59 .",
    "these values are comparable with those found from riaf model fits to the sgr a *  spectrum @xcite .    with these three relations",
    ", we can use the procedures described in   [ sect : plasma ] to calculate the axial ratio of the normal modes @xmath44 as a function of the radial distance from the black hole .",
    "this is equivalent to calculating @xmath44 at the emission point for each frequency @xmath15 .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : vsnu ] the results of this exercise , where we have calculated @xmath44 from 6 to @xmath60  schwarzschild radii , which translates to frequencies from @xmath61@xmath62  ghz , for three different magnetic field geometries .",
    "we have assumed a black hole mass of @xmath63  m@xmath64 @xcite , spherical geometry , and have ensured that @xmath30 at every radius .",
    "the gas temperature in this model of sgr a *  is large enough over the entire range of radii that the plasma normal modes are nearly always highly elliptical and thus generalized faraday rotation will be relevent .",
    "this plot can not give a specific prediction for the amount of circular and linear polarization expected from sgr a *   that must wait for a full polarized radiative transfer calculation through an mhd accretion simulation  but it does indicate that conversion will be important in the millimeter and sub - millimeter , and , thus if riaf models are accurate , circular polarization is likely to be observed at these wavelengths .",
    "as we saw in the previous section , the magnetic field geometry in the accretion flow will also have an effect on the shape of the linear modes .",
    "figure  [ fig : vsnu ] shows that a line - of - sight nearly aligned with the magnetic field will significantly suppress conversion to circular polarization over the entire frequency range .",
    "of course , polarization observations include the entire accretion flow within the beam , therefore , for a purely radial magnetic field , only the central region of the beam will observe lines - of - sight with low values of @xmath44 . however , numerical simulations of accretion flows find that the velocity shear in the gas stretches radial magnetic fields in the azimuthal direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , generating a toroidal geometry ( i.e. , a large @xmath27 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : vsnu ] shows that , in this case , conversion between linear and circular polarization will be enhanced in the beam center .",
    "it seems possible , therefore , that measurements of the percentage of both linear and circular polarization over a range of frequency may allow a constraint to be placed on the overall magnetic field geometry in the accretion flow .",
    "these results clearly indicate that generalized faraday rotation will be important in riafs , and thus could impact the interpretation of the linear polarization observations of sgr a*. as discussed in   [ sect : plasma ] , if the generalized faraday rotation is large enough , then the observed linear polarization is just the projected polarization of the plasma normal modes .",
    "changes in the measured position angle with frequency are then due to differences in the plasma normal modes at different radii , and not to classical faraday rotation . thus ,",
    "unless the generalized faraday rotation is very small , the constraints on the accretion rate onto sgr a *  derived from the classical rotation measure @xcite will not be valid .",
    "if this is the case and the linear polarization measurements track the changes in the plasma normal modes , then these observations remain powerful probes of the accretion flow .    the importance of generalized faraday rotation in the accretion flow onto sgr a *  can be estimated by calculating the angle through which the polarization vector will rotate @xcite @xmath65 where we have assumed a purely relativistic gas . taking representative values and assuming @xmath66 we obtain @xmath67 therefore , it seems plausible that generalized faraday rotation will be important in sgr a * , and the observed linear polarization measurements must be carefully interpreted .",
    "more precise calculations of @xmath68 will be performed in future work .",
    "the latest riaf models of sgr a *  indicate that the thermal plasma is relativistic over a large range of radii @xcite . this paper has shown that , in general",
    ", riafs have highly elliptical wave modes and therefore generalized faraday rotation will dominate at millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelengths . since generalized faraday rotation in riafs will not depolarize the linear polarized component of the radiation even if the number of rotations is very large , linear polarization observations of sgr a *  and other low - luminosity accretion flows may directly probe the plasma normal modes , an important diagnostic of the accretion physics .",
    "in addition , the elliptical normal modes of the plasma will cause a cyclic conversion between linear and circular polarization in this frequency range . as the ellipticity of the normal modes depend on the magnetic field geometry , circular and linear polarization observations of sgr a *  over a wide range of frequency may differentiate between radial and toroidal magnetic field geometry in the accretion flow .",
    "exact predictions of these effects require a detailed numerical simulation which is planned for future work .",
    "it is hoped that the general considerations presented here will help motivate future linear and circular polarization observational campaigns on sgr a*.      aitken , d.a .",
