    "yet the formation of multiple stellar systems is still poorly understood .",
    "currently , the most promising mechanism appears to be fragmentation during the collapse of dense molecular cloud cores @xcite .",
    "recent surveys of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars in certain star - forming regions have measured a binary frequency about twice that in the solar neighborhood ( see @xcite for a review and caveats ) . whether this is an evolutionary or environmental effect is open to debate . in any case , higher - order multiple systems appear to be relatively rare in both young and old stellar populations ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "high - resolution observations of pms multiple systems help determine the stellar and disk configurations of young objects , leading to better constraints on models of multiple star formation and early evolution .",
    "we have undertaken an adaptive optics imaging program of known pms close binary systems to search for additional companions and to detect circumstellar or circumbinary disks . in this _",
    ", we present our observations of one such system , vwcha in the chamaeleoni star - forming cloud at a distance of @xmath3160pc @xcite . the vwcha system has previously been reported to consist of several components ; @xcite listed sz23 located @xmath4 away as a possible wide companion ; @xcite discovered a closer companion at separation ; @xcite observed these components and reported an additional companion at separation from the primary .",
    "* bz97 ) obtained spatially resolved spectra of the close binary .    here ,",
    "we present the discovery of a new close companion to the secondary of vwcha and an infrared excess from the primary in the system , probably due to a dusty disk .",
    "we observed the vwcha system on 11 - 13 march 2000 with the european southern observatory 3.6-meter telescope at la silla , chile , using the adaptive optics near infrared system ( adonis ) and the sharpii+ camera .",
    "the sharpii+ camera is based on a 256@xmath5256 nicmos  iii array .",
    "we used a plate scale of 0.035arcsec / pixel , nyquist - sampling the diffraction limited point spread function ( psf ) and giving an effective field of view of @xmath5 .",
    "( 1.25@xmath6 m ) observations of vwcha were conducted during the first night and @xmath1 band ( 2.18@xmath6 m ) during the second . at @xmath0",
    "we obtained 60 frames , each with an integration time of 10s , chopping the source out of the field of view for a 10s integration on sky between each frame .",
    "the science target itself was used as the wavefront sensor of the adaptive optics ( ao ) system .",
    "the seeing during the vwcha observations the first night , as reported by the la silla seeing monitor , fluctuated in the @xmath7 band ( 0.55@xmath6 m ) between and .",
    "the @xmath1 band observations of the second night were obtained in a similar manner with 10 frames of 30s integration time each , with the difference that the sky frames were obtained after the series of on - source frames and not in between .",
    "the seeing in @xmath7 this time was stable at about . during both nights",
    "most frames showed a diffraction limited core while the strehl ratios fluctuated between 0.1 and 0.3 .",
    "after each series of observations of vwcha , an identical series of observations with the same ao correction parameters were obtained of a psf calibrator star , for post processing purposes .",
    "we used the f5v star sao256804 with @xmath7 magnitude 8.50 .",
    "the basic data reductions were done in a standard way by subtracting sky frames from source frames and then dividing by a flat field obtained on sky during dusk .",
    "the resulting frames were then not stacked together but instead processed with the myopic deconvolution algorithm idac .    from the psf",
    "calibrator star observations , we obtained an initial guess of the psf during the science data acquisition .",
    "since the psf calibrator star data were not obtained simultaneously with the science data , the initial guess psf is then modified by idac iteratively to better match the different frames of science data .",
    "a series of psf estimates corresponding to the science object series is thus produced along with the deconvolved image .",
    "the deconvolution procedure using idac took about two weeks of processing time on an ultrasparc workstation .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details on idac .",
    "we performed astrometry of the vwcha system using the deconvolved images in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the error in separation was estimated by checking the consistency of measured separations of other multiple star systems observed several times during the two nights .",
    "the error in position angle was then estimated from the error in separation , by assuming positional errors to be isotropic .    for flux calibration , we used observations of 10 other sao stars distributed over the sky and obtained during the two nights in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "their known @xmath8 and @xmath7 magnitudes and spectral classes were used to derive their @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes using standard colors @xcite and an estimate of the color excess due to extinction using table  1 of @xcite , where we assumed an optical extinction ratio @xmath9 .",
    "we then fitted a relation to the observed count rates and derived magnitudes , estimating the absolute photometric errors from the statistical error of the fit . by checking the consistency of the measured flux of stars observed several times during the two nights we derived the relative photometric errors",
    "in our observations , we are able to detect binaries at separations between and @xmath10 , where the lower limit corresponds to the diffraction limit of the 3.6-m telescope in @xmath0 , and the upper limit is due to the @xmath5 field of view . the inner binary is already resolved in the raw data in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "after deconvolution , the secondary is split up into a tight binary in itself ; see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the reported companion was not seen in any of our images . based on the background noise levels , our @xmath11 detection limits are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , well below @xmath14 derived from table 2 in @xcite .",
    "the cause for a drop in brightness by a factor of @xmath15 is hard to imagine and we suggest that either the star has drifted out of our field of view , or that the detection was spurious .      comparing our observations with measurements from 1992 @xcite",
    ", we find no significant change ( less than ) of the relative positions between the a and b+c components .",
    "since vwcha has a proper motion of about yr@xmath16 @xcite , the system as a whole has moved at least @xmath17 over the past 10 years .",
    "thus the proper motions of the components are highly correlated , corresponding to a relative velocity of less than 5kms@xmath16  at the distance of vwcha .",
    "we therefore conclude that the vwcha system is not due to chance alignment but a physical triple star .        from observations in the visual ( bz97 ) and in the infrared ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) it follows that the primary increasingly dominates the emission at increasingly longer wavelengths .",
    "interpolating between the flux ratios in different wavebands , we aportion the observed total @xmath18-magnitude @xmath19 @xcite as 11.03 to a and 11.73 to b+c . the resulting observed colors , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , can then be compared to the intrinsic colors of k5/k7 and k7 stars ( bz97 ) for @xmath22 of 3.5 and solar metallicity of the model atmospheres by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ahs00 ) , viz .",
    "( @xmath23 and 0.92 respectively .",
    "the color excess of the relatively ` blue star ' b+c is probably mainly due to foreground dust extinction , hence @xmath24 which yields @xmath25=3.03mag , where we have used the extinction curve for the chai cloud ( g.olofsson , private communication : e.g. @xmath25=2.90@xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "the assumption that this value of @xmath25  also applies to the primary would imply excess emission from component a , at the level of about 0.1mag at @xmath0 and 0.9mag at @xmath1 .",
    "an active circumprimary disk would be a natural source of such excess radiation .",
    "for the extinction and excess emission corrected @xmath0-magnitude of the primary , @xmath29 , the absolute bolometric magnitude can be obtained from [ ahs00 ] as @xmath30 . for b and c ,",
    "this value is 5.0 and 5.3 , respectively .",
    "consequently , the _ bolometric _ luminosities are @xmath31l@xmath32 , @xmath33l@xmath32  and @xmath34l@xmath32 .",
    "the ` blue ' components b and c contribute to the total flux mainly at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the neglect of correcting for extinction is expected , therefore , to underestimate the total luminosity of the system .",
    "this is indeed the case , as the _ calorimetric _ luminosity of @xmath35l@xmath32  by @xcite constitutes merely 70% of @xmath36l@xmath32 .",
    "a natural explanation of this deficit would be that only a fraction of the stellar photons are reprocessed to the infrared , while the rest escapes non - isotropically due to the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "the empirically determined parameters of the individual stellar components of vwcha are consistent with those of the theoretical evolution models ( for single stars ) by @xcite for masses of a , b and c of 1.0m@xmath32 , 0.40m@xmath32  and 0.35m@xmath32 , respectively , at the common age of @xmath37yr ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "this assumes a systematic shift of @xmath38 , not unreasonable .",
    "bz97 found the h@xmath39-line to be in emission toward both a and b+c .",
    "if dominated by disk accretion processes , some infrared excess could be expected also from the fainter pair and should thus be corrected for",
    ". however , the h@xmath39  flux is larger from a ( bz97 ) and the mass accretion rate , @xmath40 , is presumably also larger for the primary .",
    "estimates of @xmath40 , which are in reasonable agreement with the @xmath1-excess , are in the range of a few times 10@xmath41m@xmath42   @xcite to 10@xmath43m@xmath42  @xcite , but certainly much less than the large rates ( 10@xmath44 to 10@xmath45m@xmath42 ) obtained by @xcite in the far - uv , a spectral region which is highly susceptible to extinction corrections .",
    "vwcha was detected by iso at 6.7@xmath6 m  and 14.3@xmath6 m  @xcite , but not by iras at 60@xmath6 m  and 100@xmath6 m  @xcite , suggesting that only small amounts of dust exist in the system which are at temperatures significantly below 50k . for the stellar properties and mass accretion rate determined above , an outer circumprimary disk radius @xmath46au",
    "could then be inferred from standard theory of steady state , thin - disk accretion @xcite , using a temperature profile of the form @xmath47 .",
    "this minimum temperature would also be consistent with the scenario of a tidally truncated disk around a of size of at most twice the @xmath48 binary separation , advocated in the next section ( the separation of corresponds to 30 au , where @xmath49k ) .",
    "further , the observed excess in @xmath0 would be consistent with the presence of hot dust and thus of only a small central hole .",
    "however , as illustrated by the interpretation of the observed weakness of the 10@xmath6 m  silicate feature in vwcha @xcite some caution seems to be called for , when applying simplified disk theories developed for single stars to close multiples .",
    "it is interesting to note that the secondary in the ttau binary system recently has been resolved into a binary in itself @xcite .",
    "the projected relative distances for a:(b+c ) and b : c are about 100au and 10au respectively , making the configuration very similar to vwcha . in addition ,",
    "evidence for a circumprimary disk around ttau with a radius @xmath340au has been presented by @xcite .",
    "the major difference is the much higher luminosity of the ttau system , @xmath330l@xmath32  @xcite .",
    "an apparent difference is also the extremely red appearence of ttaus .",
    "this has previously been interpreted as the ( unresolved ) secondary being in a considerably earlier stage of evolution than the primary .",
    "however , later results suggest that the ir - excess may be due to foreground extinction ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the possibility that vwcha is a physical triple , bound and stable for @xmath31myr ( upper limit on age ) .",
    "components b and c form a tight pair b : c at the projected separation of 16au , while a is found at a 7 times larger projected separation of 106au .",
    "we first show analytically that a nearly planar 3-body system similar to vwcha , with low eccentricities , is forever stable against the disintegration of the close binary by the third massive body .",
    "we utilize energetic constraints on the motion of a 3-body system , similar to the familiar zero - velocity curves in the restricted 3-body problem where the jacobi integral entails the so - called hill stability , involving no exchange of components and no ionization. a small binary b : c will never be pulled apart by component a , if ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the total mechanical energy of the triple system , @xmath52 its total angular momentum , @xmath18 the semi - moment of inertia ( one - half times the sum of the squares of radius vectors times masses ) , and @xmath53 the total potential energy of the triple .",
    "subscript @xmath54 denotes the value at the collinear `` lagrange point '' between the two most massive bodies .",
    "stability does not depend on either the total mass or the distance units .",
    "e.g. , tilting a given system with respect to the plane of the sky merely rescales the inferred periods but not the shapes of orbits .",
    "if projection effects are not extreme , the orbital periods are close to those in a planar system with semi - major axes of @xmath55au and @xmath56au for the a:(b+c ) and b : c pairs , i.e.  on the order of 872yr and 74yr .    for the masses given in table  [ tbl-1 ]",
    ", we found that right hand side of the stability criterion equals @xmath57 ( where @xmath58m@xmath32   is the total mass ) .",
    "our results show that if the initial orbit of the outer binary a:(b+c ) is circular ( @xmath59 ) , then the b : c pair is hill stable for a wide range of @xmath60 ( its initial eccentricity ) @xmath61 and its semi - major axis @xmath62au . if @xmath63 , stability can be assures for @xmath64au . alternatively , assuming cautiously that in the current configuration both orbits are at apocenters ( maximum extension ) we find that eccentricities @xmath65 and @xmath66 are required for stability . in summary , the 3-body , @xmath67 criterion guarantees that a nearly coplanar hierarchical system ( with geometry consistent with vwcha ) , having small eccentricities , will never restructure by ejecting any star to infinity or form a close pair of either a : b or a : c .    the analytical criterion can not guarantee that the b and c components will not physically collide .",
    "it might also indicate instability where none actually occurs on interesting , short , time scale ( which we fix at 1 myr ) . to confirm its predictions , we therefore integrated the motion of vwcha - like configurations with a 7th-8th order runge - kutta method , accurate to 10 significant digits in the total energy .",
    "we assumed @xmath68 au and @xmath69 au .",
    "only the ratio @xmath70 , is decisive for stability",
    ". mutual approaches of stars to less than @xmath71 km ( @xmath72 pms stellar radii ) were treated as physical mergers following a tidal capture .",
    "we found that the analytical and numerical criteria approximately coincide .",
    "for instance , we confirmed numerically our analytical predictions discussed above .",
    "[ fig-2 ] presents numerical results for the planar and inclined system configurations .",
    "curves are labeled with the starting initial inclination of the inner and outer orbits .",
    "combinations of the eccentricities located below the plotted curves represent stable systems .",
    "all destruction modes including physical collisions of stars were observed above the curves .",
    "strictly speaking , the lines shown in the figure result from averaging of the results over such unessential initial parameters as the longitudes of pericenters , ascending nodes and true anomalies    from fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] we conclude that a wide variety of eccentricities result in stable behavior .",
    "while @xmath73 is generally required , larger @xmath60 values ( up to 0.8 ) are consistent with stability , independent of the mutual orbital inclination ( with exception of unstable , almost perpendicular orbits not presented here ) .",
    "we conclude that the hierachical projected structure of vwcha likely reflects a stable physical configuration for the estimated age of the system .",
    "the young double star vwcha ( separation ) has been successfully observed with adaptive optics techniques in the infrared @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "these ao observations led to the followig main findings :    * the secondary is a very close binary itself ( separation ) . *",
    "this physical triple system is shown to be stable over a period exceeding its estimated age of 0.4myr . *",
    "follow - up astrometric observations may , within a few years , constrain the dynamical mass of the b : c subsystem , thus testing evolutionary models of pms stars . * the primary ( a ) has a significant ir - excess , indicating the presence of a circumprimary disk .",
    "this disk is probably small , with a radius not exceding @xmath330au .",
    "we had many helpful discussions on vwcha with gran olofsson and gsta gahm .",
