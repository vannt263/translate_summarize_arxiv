    "during the last decade , due to the advances in the control of materials growth , and also in the techniques of characterization , a new interest arose in the study of the magnetic order in layered materials .",
    "this area is not restricted to magnetism in metals , but it also includes the study of magnetic semiconductor pseudo - binary alloys like a@xmath1m@xmath2b , where m stands for a magnetic ion .",
    "these alloys are called diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) .",
    "@xcite    recently some groups @xcite succeeded in producing homogeneous samples of ga@xmath1mn@xmath2as alloys with @xmath4 up to @xmath5 using low temperature ( @xmath6 c ) mbe techniques .",
    "mn is a transition metal having its @xmath7 level partially filled with five electrons , in such a way that it carries a magnetic moment of @xmath8 , according to the hund s rule . in the insulating phase , as in ii - vi dms , two mn@xmath3 ions occupying the nearest neighbor positions are assumed to interact with each other _ via _ a super - exchange mechanism , resulting in an anti - ferromagnetic ordering of their magnetic moments . in the fcc alloys , these interactions are frustrated , establishing the possibility of settling a spin - glass phase at low temperature .",
    "a double exchange mechanism which might stabilize a ferromagnetic coupling between the mn ions in iii - v dms has been suggested by akai , @xcite but has not been confirmed in the epr experiments performed by szczytko et al , @xcite who did not observe trace of neutral mn , concluding that the double exchange mechanism is not effective .",
    "the possibility of having a dms based on gaas opens a wide range of potential applications such as integrated magnetooptoelectronic devices .",
    "besides its practical importance , this kind of dms introduces an interesting problem : an mn impurity in gaas is an acceptor ( it binds one hole ) , and at the same time it carries a localized magnetic moment . in the ga@xmath1mn@xmath2as alloy mn",
    "is , in fact , a strong @xmath9 dopant , @xcite the free hole concentration reaching even @xmath10 . at small mn concentrations ,",
    "the alloy is a paramagnetic insulator .",
    "as @xmath4 increases it becomes ferromagnetic , going through a non - metal - to - metal transition for higher concentrations , and keeping its ferromagnetic phase . for @xmath4 above @xmath11 ,",
    "the alloy becomes a ferromagnetic insulator .",
    "@xcite in the metallic phase , depending on the value of @xmath4 , the temperature of the ferromagnetic transition is observed in the range of 30 - 100 k , the highest values observed in dms . the ferromagnetic order in the metallic phase",
    "is understood , at present , as resulting from the indirect exchange between the mn@xmath12 ions due to the spin polarization of the hole gas .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the magnetic order resulting of the indirect exchange between magnetic moments in a gaalas@xmath0ga@xmath1 mn@xmath2as quantum well .",
    "a confinement - adapted ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) @xcite mechanism is believed to be the most important interaction in such systems , if sufficiently strong doping is provided , as it is the case in metallic samples .",
    "it leads to an indirect exchange coupling between mn@xmath3 ions , mediated by carriers ( holes ) , which come from the same mn@xmath3 ions .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ rkky ] we present the calculation of the rkky exchange for a confined fermi gas in a semiconductor heterostructure . for the sake of relating our results with other previous ones ,",
    "we explicitly separate our calculations as intra - subband and inter - subband contributions .",
    "we emphasize that , in the quantum limit , i.e. , when only the first subband is occupied , the intra - subband exchange is factorized into a purely 2-d rkky exchange times a form factor determined by the architecture of the confining structure.@xcite    in sec .",
    "[ moncar ] a monte carlo simulation is performed to determine the resulting magnetic phases and the relevant properties .",
    "our calculations reveal that a ferromagnetic order may occur in a single dms quantum well only beyond a minimum width of the magnetic layer , otherwise the sample is paramagnetic .",
    "this is in keeping with recent experiments,@xcite and is a consequence of the need of a certain number of magnetic neighbors before a ferromagnetic phase settles in . depending on the well width and on the effective two - dimensional carrier concentration , a canted phase can occur , with a sizeable net low - temperature magnetization , @xmath13 , and a well behaved edwards - anderson order parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the origin of the canted spin phase is investigated by analyzing the parallel and the perpendicular magnetizations , and the spin - spin correlation function components .",
    "the magnetic susceptibilities are calculated in the existing phases .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ comments ] we summarize the results obtained , and comment about the expected magnetic order in the structures analyzed .",
    "the rkky interaction between localized magnetic moments imbedded in a fermi gas is a well understood problem , since its early developments almost fifty years ago .",
    "however , the new areas for experimental research brought into evidence some theoretical problems concerning the rkky interaction in low dimensional systems , so far unexplored , such as purely 2-d and 1-d arrangements of magnetic moments , interaction between magnetic layers , magnetic moments in inhomogeneous electron gas , etc . @xcite the indirect exchange between localized magnetic moments in a quantum well mediated by a fermi gas has been addressed several times",
    ". basically , it deals with a confined electron ( or hole ) gas , therefore a quasi - two - dimensional system , being locally polarized by magnetic moments distributed in a layer . to our knowledge ,",
    "korenblit and shender,@xcite were the first to obtain a closed expression to the equivalent of the rkky interaction in the limiting situation of a purely 2-d electron gas , although kittel@xcite obtained a numerical solution to this question earlier .",
    "larsen @xcite derived an expression for a general dimensionality , reproducing korenblit and shender results for d=2 . a detailed calculation to obtain a closed expression in 2-d was shown by bal - monod.@xcite gummich and da cunha lima @xcite studied the indirect exchange between magnetic impurities in a doped gaas / alas quantum well in the diluted regime , obtaining a ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "finally , another expression for a generic dimensionality has been derived by aristov .",
    "@xcite the approximation of the fermi gas in a quantum well by a purely 2-d system is seldom a reasonable choice .",
    "helman and baltensperger @xcite treated the question of the polarization of an inhomogeneous electron gas in several circumstances , emphasizing the roles of the confined and extended states .",
    "the specific case of a dms quantum well was addressed recently by dietl et al , @xcite but they assumed that the magnetic moments are spread all over the region allowed to the carriers , and in that case the inter - subband contributions to the curie - weiss temperature cancel out in a mean field approximation .",
    "the interaction potential between a fermi gas and a set of localized magnetic moments at positions @xmath15 is well described by the hund - type exchange potential :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the spin of the magnetic moment at position @xmath18 , which will be treated as a classical variable , and @xmath19 is the spin operator of the fermion at @xmath20 .",

    "are confined in the growth direction , assumed to be the z - axis , due to the mismatch of the conduction and valence band edges .",

    "the transition temperatures were found in the range of 40 to 50 k. no spin glass phase with vanishing magnetization was found .",
    "the existence of the canted phase requires a careful analysis of a possible dependence on the cooling process initial conditions . in order to clarify that point , we performed two additional simulations on sample # 5 , starting at @xmath108 k , where the sample shows already a significant partial alignment of spins , and we proceeded with the slow cooling down process . in the first simulation , we assumed a starting configuration in which all spins are aligned perpendicularly to the interface . in the second",

    "in other samples , however , the ferromagnetic interaction prevails and the total magnetization is reached ( samples # 08 and # 09 ) . notice that the canted phase appears here already for @xmath110 , while the phase is still ferromagnetic for that width when @xmath111 .",
    "the transition temperatures were estimated to lie between 30 k and 50 k.    in fig .",

    "the choice of a larger @xmath84 ordered spins in a ferromagnetic phase , with transition temperatures calculated to be @xmath116 k for the sample # 15 , and @xmath117 k for sample # 16 .",
    "the cutoff radius of 4 ml is smaller than the first zero of @xmath118 . in this situation",
    "the canted spin arrangement is not allowed , and the sample can be either paramagnetic or ferromagnetic .    finally in fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] the magnetic susceptibility for sample # 07 is presented , calculated from the equilibrium magnetization fluctuations .",
    "notice that the peak in the in the susceptibility indicates the same @xmath119 as estimated from the magnetizations and ea order parameter curves ( figs .",
    "[ fig01 ] and [ fig02 ] respectively ) .",
    "the results of the monte carlo simulations indicate that , besides the choice of the range of the interaction ( the cutoff radius @xmath84 ) , two parameters are determining in the magnetic ordering in these heterostructures : the magnetic layer width @xmath120 , and the carrier concentration @xmath9 .    it is observed from resistivity measurements , that the holes have a small mean free path @xcite in these materials",
    ". the criteria for choosing the cutoff in a monte carlo simulation must take into account natural scales of the interaction .",
    "these scales are the transport mean free path ( since the rkky interaction is based on the very existence of free carriers ) , and also the spin coherence length .",
    "we tested different @xmath121 s , in the range of the mean free path estimated from resistivity data .",
    "the influence of this parameter on the magnetic order is simple . if @xmath121 is smaller than the first zero of @xmath122 ( a proper choice for the case in which the transport mean free path or the spin coherence length are small ) , there are two possibilities of magnetic order : ferromagnetic or paramagnetic . for larger @xmath84 , on the other hand ,",
    "corresponding to the cases where both the transport mean free path and the coherence length are large , a canted magnetization may be observed .    in all the explored samples ,",
    "no spin glass phase was found .",
    "this is presumably due to the fact that while the spin frustration exists , as witnessed by the occurrence of canted spin phases , it is not strong enough to produce a spin glass phase , as in canonical metallic spin glasses . a spin glass phase in these dms structures would probably require a much higher carrier concentration .    in what concerns the influence of the width of the quantum well",
    ", we conclude that , for thin layers , the number of interacting ions is small within the cutoff radius , and the sample is paramagnetic . when @xmath120 becomes larger , the number of interacting ions increases and a collective magnetic ordering may be observed .",
    "the fact that the appearance of a magnetic order occurs only above a minimum thickness of the magnetic layer has already been observed experimentally.@xcite    since the rkky interaction oscillates with the argument ( @xmath123 ) , which depends on the carrier concentration , raising @xmath9 produces a change on @xmath124 , increasing the number of oscillations of @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , antiferromagnetic interactions can be turned on , resulting in all kind of couplings . in this situation ,",
    "ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions compete in establishing the magnetic order , which depends on the other sample characteristics , resulting in a total or in a partial alignment of the mn magnetic moments .",
    "the occurrence of partial magetization ( about 40% ) has also been observed in samples of ( in , mn)as/(ga , al)sb .",
    "@xcite    to conclude , we believe that the rkky mechanism explains the high transition temperatures experimentally observed in ga@xmath1mn@xmath2as heterostructures , at least in the metallic phase . additionally , it explains , as it becomes clear after these monte carlo simulations , the occurrence of samples showing a partial magnetization at low temperatures .",
    "the possibility of having a ferromagnetic phase in samples with a low mn concentration , i.e. , in the ferromagnetic insulator ga@xmath1mn@xmath2as , remains to be explained .",
