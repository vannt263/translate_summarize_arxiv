    "the massless scalar field serves as internal time in einstein and wheeler - dewitt equations used in loop quantum cosmology @xmath1 .",
    "one regards the massless scalar field as a parameter connecting the space - time coordinates . by doing",
    "that one does not replace the lorentz time variable with the massless scalar field , but instead adds one more time variable , since the lorentz time plays an important role in wdw derivation being an adm split variable .",
    "the original form of the equation @xmath2 uses the adm split of the 4-dimensional riemann space by the @xmath3 hyper - surfaces .",
    "therefore there are eventually two time variables in the loop quantum cosmology version of wdw equation .",
    "the goal of the current research is to use only one time variable - the massless scalar field , for both purposes : the adm split and as internal time . in order to achieve this",
    "we consider a 4-dimensional lorentz space as embedded into the 5-dimensional space by adding the massless scalar field as a fifth coordinate . we define a new adm split by the @xmath0 , scalar field equals constant hyper - surfaces , and derive the analog of the wheeler - dewitt equation for the 4-dimensional supermetric .",
    "such equation will describe the evolution of the 4-dimensional lorentz hyper - surfaces along the scalar massless field .",
    "we derive the dynamics equation by considering the hilbert - einstein 5-dimensional action in two different forms : the new adm split and the non - compactified version of the kaluza - klein formalism .",
    "the kaluza - klein 5-dimensional unified theory was known for a long time @xmath4 . by varying the hilbert - einstein vacuum action in the 5-dimensional space ,",
    "one obtains the 4-dimensional einstein equation with the electromagnetic and matter stress - tensor on the right hand side plus the maxwell equation .",
    "the magic is probably due to the campbell s conjecture stating that any 4-dimensional riemann space can be embedded into the 5-dimensional ricci flat space @xmath5 .",
    "one had yet to explain why the fifth dimension was not observable in the classical world . to address it",
    ", klein introduced the compactified model , @xmath6 , where the fifth coordinate belonged to a compact group .    in the wdw equation used in the loop quantum cosmology",
    "the fifth coordinate plays the role of internal time and has a physical meaning of the scalar massless field .",
    "therefore there is no need in any compactification procedures .",
    "hence we use in this paper the non - compactified kaluza - klein formalism .",
    "a few recent papers studied the conventional adm in the 5-dimensional space @xmath7 @xmath8 , where the split was carried out by the time - constant @xmath9 hyper - surfaces , rather than by matter - constant @xmath0 hyper - surfaces used in this paper .",
    "following that research , the 3-dimensional supermetric wheeler - dewitt equation was studied in @xmath10 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath11",
    ", we carry out the new adm split by the @xmath0 hyper - surfaces . in section @xmath12",
    ", we consider kaluza - klein non - compactified representation . in section @xmath13 , we derive the 4-dimensional supermetric wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "we conclude with the discussion in the final section @xmath14 .",
    "we begin with the adm split in the 5-dimensional riemann space with respect to the scalar massless field as internal time .",
    "the riemann space coordinates are @xmath15 , the metric below is a 4-dimensional lorentz metric plus the massless scalar field corresponding to the fifth coordinate . for the 5-dimensional metric we use the notation @xmath16 for the 4-dimensional metric we use @xmath17 , where the indeces are @xmath18 and @xmath19 + @xmath20 +",

    "consider the 4 + 1 split of the 5-dimensional space - time - matter manifold @xmath24 by the four dimensional hyper - surfaces @xmath0 .",
    "+    we proceed similar to 3 + 1 case with @xmath25 playing the role of the time lapse n , and @xmath26 playing the role of the time shift @xmath27 , with the very important difference : we consider both @xmath0 spacelike and timelike cases .",
    "the spacelike case corresponds to @xmath28 , while the timelike to @xmath29 .",
    "we project the 5-dimensional covariant derivative and decompose it into lapse and shift :    @xmath30    @xmath31    we then define the extrinsic curvature to be the first term in ( @xmath32 ) + @xmath33    as for the second term in ( @xmath32 ) , it is a 4-dimensional covariant derivative in the 4-dimensional space .",
    "@xmath34    it is easy to prove that the expression above is a 4-dimensional connection ( covariant derivative ) .",
    "one should prove that it satisfies the leibniz law , preserves the metric and is torsion free .    by applying the above formula to the massless scalar field",
    "we obtain ( see figure 1 )    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    we use ( @xmath38 ) in order to project the 5-dimensional riemann curvature tensor to the 4-dimensional subspace and obtain the gauss and codazzi equations for the 5-dimensional space .    by the riemann tensor definition : @xmath39    and ( @xmath40 ) , ( @xmath38 ) we obtain the gauss equation in 5-dimensional spacelike adm    @xmath41    and codazzi equation for the 5-dimensional adm    @xmath42    by contracting the indexes in the above formula we get the expression for the 4 + 1 scalar riemann curvature @xmath43      the hilbert - einstein 5-dimensional vacuum space action with the metric as above    @xmath44    by using ( @xmath45 ) we can now write the action via 4 + 1 decomposition :    @xmath46    we used the @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is a 5-dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "since we are considering the case of the comoving coordinates @xmath49 , i.e only lapse and no shift , the extrinsic curvature is    @xmath50    from ( @xmath51 ) and ( @xmath52 ) we obtain the expression for the momentum + @xmath53    where we used @xmath54 to denote the derivative with respect to the fifth coordinate @xmath55 to distinguish it from the usual dot symbol , the derivative with respect to time variable @xmath56    from the momentum expression and legendre transform we obtain the hamiltonian :    @xmath57    thus the hamiltonian constraint becomes : @xmath58      we can now see if the 4-dimensional supermetric can be defined similar to dewitt s @xmath2 3-dimensional one .",
    "fortunately it works .",
    "one can check that    @xmath59    or by introducing the 4-dimensional supermetric notation @xmath60    and recalling the expression ( @xmath61 ) for the momentum @xmath62 we can rewrite ( @xmath63 ) as    @xmath64    we can now obtain the expression for the adm hamiltonian . from ( @xmath65 ) and ( @xmath66 )    @xmath67",

    "it will be expressed in the terms of the massless scalar field . by comparing it with the action in terms of extrinsic curvature obtained in the previous section we will derive 4-dimensional supermetric analog of the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "we begin with the introduction to the kaluza - klein theory .",
    "one considers the 5-dimensional hilbert - einstein action @xmath5 in vacuum @xmath68    and by varying it with respect to the following 5-dimensional metric + @xmath69 + one obtains the einstein equation in 4-dimensional space with the electromagnetic and matter stress energy tensor on the r.h.s plus the maxwell equation for the electromagnetic field .",
    "we consider the case @xmath70 with no electromagnetic field and only the massless scalar field @xmath25 being present .",

    "the action ( @xmath71 ) is also the same as the one considered in the 5-dimensional adm model above .",
    "thus we have two formalisms describing the same physical system : 5d adm and 5d kaluza - klein .",
