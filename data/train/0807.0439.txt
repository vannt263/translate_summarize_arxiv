    "because of the potential relevance for inflationary cosmology , the quantum behavior of gravitons on a ( locally ) de sitter background has been a widely studied subject over the past years  @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "one line of research deals with the back - reaction of gravitational waves on the background spacetime  @xcite . however of more interest for the present work is the one loop back - reaction by virtual gravitons on a de sitter background which has been calculated by several authors using different techniques  @xcite@xcite@xcite . since it is not clear whether in these works exactly the same quantity is calculated and the renormalization schemes differ , the numerical coefficients differ .",
    "however the main result is qualitatively the same : one loop graviton contributions to the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor result in a finite , time independent shift of the effective cosmological constant .",
    "since the contribution can always be absorbed in a counterterm  @xcite , the exact numerical coefficient has no real physical meaning .",
    "+ the goal of this paper is to go beyond the works mentioned above and calculate the one loop effective action induced by gravitons in a more general background space - time using dimensional regularization .",
    "the geometry we consider is a friedmann - lematre - roberston - walker ( flrw ) geometry with hubble parameter @xmath4 and the additional constraint that @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "standard matter , radiation or dark energy dominated universes all satisfy this constraint ( recall that in matter era @xmath6 , while in radiation era @xmath7 ) and de sitter space is the special limit when @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "one immediate problem with working in such a space - time , instead of in de siter space , is that , for consistency of the einstein equations , the addition of matter fields is unavoidable . whereas in de",
    "sitter space , the only relevant metric fluctuations are the tensor modes ( gravitational waves ) , in a more general setting also the scalar modes , due to the mixing of gravitational and matter degrees of freedom , have to be taken into account  @xcite@xcite @xcite .",
    "this full treatment is considerably more complicated and is presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "for now we will only focus on the tensor modes , and do not consider the mixing of degrees of freedom .",
    "+ the main motivation for this work is to show explicitly that new effects can occur when one considers loop effects in a more general background then de sitter space .",
    "we find new effects first of all in quasi de sitter space , where due to the presence of an ultraviolet divergence one generates small , but physical corrections to the quantum friedmann equations that can not be subtracted by local counterterms .",

    "before specializing the discussion to the two cases discussed above , we make some general remarks on the validity of our results .",

    "a nonconstant @xmath2 would induce corrections to the propagators as calculated in section [ sprop ] and unfortunately it is not yet known how to calculate these .",

    "+ a second general concern is the issue of gauge invariance ( invariance under infinitesimal coordinate transformations ) .",
    "when both a gravitational field and a matter field are present , the fluctuations in those fields are coupled and do not transform independently . therefore one can not self consistently quantize the gravitational fluctuations , without quantizing the matter fluctuations .",
    "the types of structures ( e.g. the poles in the digamma functions ) , however , are generic since they are naturally generated by the coincident limit of any propagator of the form ( [ scal_prop ] ) , and they do not disappear when matter fluctuations are included  @xcite .    because the poles of the digamma functions @xmath215 that yield a divergent one loop effective potential  ( [ un - renormalized ] ) are sufficiently distant from the quasi - de sitter limit @xmath8 considered here , the results of our dynamical analyisis can be trusted as long as @xmath216 . when this condition is satisfied , quantum effects do not change the fact that at late times the universe asymptotes a de sitter attractor , albeit with a modified expansion rate given by @xmath195 in eq .",
    "( [ 4roots ] ) .",
    "the leading order quantum effect at late times has a contribution proportional to @xmath217 to the effective energy momentum tensor .",
    "a contribution of this form has also been found in earlier studies of graviton one - loop effects in de sitter space  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the exact contribution is unknown because of the ambiguity in the counterterms .",
    "depending on the choice of counterterms , the contribution could slightly increase or decrease the effective late time cosmological constant .",
    "although in our more general treatment , divergencies appear in the effective action , leading to the logarithmic correction to ( [ friedepsklein ] ) , these corrections have no significant effect at late times .",
    "+ at early times the contribution of quantum effects becomes more significant .",
    "however in this regime we have lost predictability , since the results strongly depend on the unknown part of the counterterms and the renormalization scale @xmath142 @xmath218 . moreover , the assumption that @xmath219 and nearly constant appears to be violated .",
    "in this paper we calculated the quantum corrected friedmann equations due to the one loop vacuum bubble from gravitons in a flrw universe with constant @xmath220 .",
    "the result has a divergence that contains terms proportional to @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 , which can be renormalized using local counterterms , which include both geometric and scalar field counterterms .",
    "this is consistent with the result that in de sitter space ( @xmath1 ) one loop effects lead to a finite constant shift of the cosmological term @xmath224 .",
    "we study the dynamics in the quasi de sitter limit and find that they are not much different from the dynamics in true de sitter space .",
    "indeed , the quantum effects induce a shift in the effective , late time , cosmological constant @xmath225 , where @xmath52 is an unknown parameter , that can be expressed in terms of the gauss - bonnet counterterm with an @xmath226 coefficient .",
    "although our results are correct within the approximations used , the results described above should not be taken too literally .",
    "the propagators we used ( and hence the singularity structure we find ) are strictly speaking only valid when @xmath227 .",

    ", our late time solution does have @xmath228 .",
    "therefore we have good reasons to believe that our solution approximates well the solution of the full theory , at least at late times and sufficiently close to de sitter space .",
    "another issue is that we choose our propagator such to describe a physically meaningful vacuum state .",
    "however , due to the evolution and mixing of modes , close to the de sitter attractor the universe will not be in a vacuum state , but in some excited state ( that can be described by mode mixing in momentum space ) , which might influence our results .",
    "we postpone a study of this question for future publication .",
    "the next issue is the question of gauge invariance . since there is both matter and gravity in our model",
    ", one should self - consistently take both fluctuations in matter and gravitons into account .",
    "this issue is complicated due to the mixing of the degrees of freedom , and hence it is addressed in a separate publication  @xcite .",
    "taking this mixing into account changes our results quantitatively , but since the singularity structure is inherent in the propagators ( and those do not change ) , the logarithmic terms do not cancel , such that qualitative features of the analysis presented here remain unchanged .",
    "finally , an important question is what are the dynamics near the poles of the digamma functions @xmath215 where the one loop effective potential  ( [ renormalized ] ) diverges .",
    "the corresponding dynamical analysis is performed in ref .",
    "here we just note that the universe typically gets stuck near the poles , such that each pole acts as a late time attractor .",
    "probably the most important attractors are the two highest poles @xmath229 and @xmath230 ( the latter is also the value of @xmath2 in matter era ) .",
    "the latter pole is the late time attractor of a universe filled mostly with radiation and a cosmological term  @xcite , which represents a realistic composition of the universe immediately after the big bang .",
