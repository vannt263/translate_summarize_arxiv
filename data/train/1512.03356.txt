    "the field of frustrated magnetism represents an active research topic in condensed matter physics ,  @xcite due to the possibility that unconventional phases may be stabilized , with topological properties and fractionalized excitations ( i.e. , carrying fractions of the `` elementary quantum numbers '' or obeying fractional or anyonic statistics ) .",
    "fascinating examples are given by the so - called spin liquids , which are obtained whenever competing magnetic interactions are strong enough to prevent any possible magnetic ordering down to zero temperature . among various materials that show promising low - temperature behaviors ,",
    "the family of organic charge - transfer salts @xmath6-(et)@xmath7x represents a very important candidate for hosting spin - liquid properties . in these materials , strongly dimerized organic molecules are arranged in stacked two - dimensional anisotropic triangular layers , where , up to a good level of approximation , two out of three hoppings are equal ( @xmath8 ) , while the third one is different ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "several magnetic and superconducting phases may be observed , by varying pressure and temperature , as well as the nature of the anion x.  @xcite the most interesting compound of the family is given by @xmath6-(et)@xmath7cu@xmath7(cn)@xmath10 , where no signal of magnetic order has been detected down to very low temperatures , thus indicating that a non - magnetic mott insulator may be eventually realized .",
    "@xcite since this compound is moderately correlated , the estimate of the frustrating ratio has been performed by several independent groups within density - functional approaches , which estimated the values of the two different hoppings @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these calculations lead to a degree of anisotropy that is between the square lattice and the isotropic triangular one , e.g. , @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite however , this result has been recently questioned by a calculation that instead suggests a more isotropic triangular structure , e.g. , @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite in any case , the @xmath6-(et)@xmath7x family is a fertile field for the search of spin - liquid compounds . indeed , besides @xmath6-(et)@xmath7cu@xmath7(cn)@xmath10 , compounds have been recently discovered , showing interesting low - temperature properties ; among them , we would like to mention @xmath6-(et)@xmath7b(cn)@xmath13 , which appears to be strongly correlated and with a marked one - dimensional character .",
    "@xcite finally , also another family of salts based on the organic molecule pd(dmit)@xmath7 has been shown to possess rich phase diagrams .",
    "@xcite even if a fully anisotropic triangular lattice is more suitable to properly describe these materials ,  @xcite a simpler modelization in terms of a @xmath14 anisotropic triangular lattice has been also considered in density - functional theory .",
    "@xcite the estimated hopping parameters fall in the window @xmath15 for the two compounds with a non - magnetic ground state , namely me@xmath10etsb[pd(dmit)@xmath7]@xmath7  @xcite and me@xmath10etp[pd(dmit)@xmath7]@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite    besides these organic materials , the anisotropic triangular lattice is also appropriate to describe two isostructural and isoelectronic compounds , cs@xmath7cubr@xmath13 and cs@xmath7cucl@xmath13 , where magnetic copper atoms lie on weakly coupled triangular lattices . while cs@xmath7cucl@xmath13 shows spin - liquid behavior over a broad temperature range , with spin excitations that appear to be gapless ,  @xcite the cs@xmath7cubr@xmath13 compound exhibits a magnetic ground state with spiral order in zero magnetic field .",
    "@xcite both these materials are much more strongly correlated than organic salts and their physical properties can be captured by frustrated heisenberg models ( possibly decorated by small perturbations , such as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ) .",
    "most importantly , these materials have @xmath17 and , therefore , their structure can be seen as chains ( defined along @xmath1 ) coupled together through a zigzag coupling ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the distinct physical behaviors are generally attributed to the different degree of frustration , i.e. , the ratio between inter - chain and intra - chain super - exchange couplings in the underlying anisotropic triangular lattice . for cs@xmath7cucl@xmath13 ,",
    "a direct comparison between neutron scattering experiments and theoretical calculations ,  @xcite the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility ,  @xcite as well as recent estimates based on spin - resonance spectroscopy experiments ,  @xcite suggest that the ratio between intra - chain @xmath1 and inter - chain @xmath0 magnetic couplings is @xmath18 .",
    "a small inter - layer coupling @xmath19 of the order of @xmath20 is responsible for the appearance of a three - dimensional magnetic order below @xmath21k .",
    "instead , the situation is more controversial for the cs@xmath7cubr@xmath13 compound , where a comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical calculations of ref .",
    "suggests a frustrating ratio of @xmath22 ,  @xcite in agreement with density - functional theory calculations ,  @xcite while a more recent determination of the super - exchange couplings via spin - resonance spectroscopy indicates more one - dimensional features , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we study the frustrated @xmath24 heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular lattice . despite its simplicity , the ground state of this model is still controversial , with different methods giving more emphasis either to spin liquids or to magnetic phases . on the one hand ,",
    "spiral orders with non - trivial periodicities appear at the classical level and may survive to quantum fluctuations ; previous calculations have considered this issue within various approximations , e.g. , by using series expansion ,  @xcite coupled - cluster approaches ,  @xcite and the gutzwiller approximation .",
    "@xcite recently , the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) has been used to study magnetic correlations and the associated finite - size effects , obtaining an incommensurate behavior over a wide range of the phase diagram .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the presence of competing interactions in the anisotropic triangular lattice attracted also a large interest in the search of spin - liquid phases .",
    "while the isotropic point is well established as a magnet with a three - sublattice periodicity ( the so - called @xmath25 order ) ,  @xcite the presence of anisotropies may favor a non - magnetic ground state with respect to generic spiral states .",
    "however , on the anisotropy regime interpolating between a square lattice and the isotropic triangular one , the quest for spin - liquid phases has been very limited and includes only calculations based upon spin - wave theories  @xcite or on schwinger bosons .",
    "@xcite a dimer - ordered state has been also proposed for @xmath26 by a series - expansion approach .",
    "@xcite on the contrary , when the anisotropic triangular lattice interpolates between the triangular lattice and a set of decoupled chains , the existence of an essentially one - dimensional spin - liquid phase for @xmath27 has been investigated by using variational monte carlo ( vmc ) based on gutzwiller projected states ,  @xcite exact diagonalization ,  @xcite and the functional renormalization group ,  @xcite the last study also including the presence of incommensurate magnetism , close to the isotropic point .",
    "the strong one - dimensional nature of this spin - liquid phase has been also investigated by a mean - field study based on majorana fermions .",
    "@xcite an alternative scenario has been suggested in the limit of quasi - one dimensional lattices , where magnetic order with a collinear pattern could be stabilized ;",
    "@xcite this claim has been supported by using coupled - cluster methods  @xcite and dmrg calculations on a three - leg ladder .",
    "@xcite some evidence that , for @xmath27 , collinear antiferromagnetism is favored over generic spiral states with coplanar order has been also reported by an exact diagonalization study with twisted boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite finally , in addition to the one - dimensional ( gapless ) spin liquid , vmc calculations also suggested the possibility that a ( gapped ) spin liquid exists close to the isotropic point .",
    "@xcite however , in this regime , a direct comparison with magnetically ordered states with spiral order was not fully considered .",
    "the aim of this work is to perform a direct comparison of different spin liquids and magnetic states with spiral order , that are treated on the same ground within the vmc approach , thus going beyond the previous limitations .",
    "we draw the complete phase diagram of the heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular lattice , for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 . with respect to previous vmc works that considered complicated parametrizations of the wave functions with several variational parameters ,",
    "@xcite here we construct more transparent wave functions for both spiral magnetic order and non - magnetic states .",
    "in particular , spiral phases are considered for the first time ; moreover , we analyze the spin liquids that can be constructed by using the fermionic projective - symmetry group classification .",
    "@xcite the main result of our calculations is that magnetic states with spiral order have competing energies with respect to magnetically disordered states in the whole phase diagram . for @xmath2",
    ", magnetic states always have a lower energy compared to spin liquids , which are competitive only in a small window @xmath4 . for @xmath3 , we confirm that , close to the limit of decoupled chains , spin - liquid wave functions have better energies with respect to magnetic states ( including collinear ones ) , indicating the presence of a quasi - one - dimensional magnetically disordered phase for @xmath5 . in contrast , close to the isotropic point , spiral states have lower energies than spin - liquid ones .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "we consider the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular lattice , as described by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the spin-1/2 operator at the site @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the antiferromagnetic coupling , including an intra - chain @xmath1 along @xmath32 , and an inter - chain @xmath0 along @xmath33 and @xmath34 , see fig  [ fig : lattice ] and ref .  .",
    "the coordinates of the lattice sites are given by @xmath35 . in the following ,",
    "we consider clusters with periodic boundary conditions defined by the vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which contain @xmath38 sites",

    "finally , @xmath48 is the ground state of a non - interacting fermionic hamiltonian , which can describe either magnetic or non - magnetic states .",
    "all the calculations are performed in the subspace with no net spin polarization , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "given the presence of the gutzwiller projector and the jastrow factor , a monte carlo sampling is needed to compute any expectation value over these correlated variational states .",
    "let us now describe the two families of variational states that are used to draw the phase diagram .",
    "the first one is given by magnetic states . in this case , @xmath48 is the ground state of a non - interacting fermionic hamiltonian that contains both a band contribution and a magnetic term : @xmath50 the magnetic term is of the form @xmath51 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & h \\sum_j \\left [ e^{-i { \\bf q}\\cdot{\\bf r}_j } c^{\\dagger}_{j,\\uparrow } c^{{{\\phantom{\\dagger}}}}_{j,\\downarrow } +                       e^{i { \\bf q}\\cdot{\\bf r}_j } c^{\\dagger}_{j,\\downarrow } c^{{{\\phantom{\\dagger}}}}_{j,\\uparrow } \\right ] , \\label{eq : haf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the pitch vector @xmath52 determines the magnetic ordering in the @xmath53 plane and @xmath54 is a variational parameter to be optimized . here , the fermionic operator @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) creates ( destroys ) one electron with spin @xmath57 on the site @xmath58 .    in real space",

    "for example , a pitch angle of @xmath65 corresponds to nel order , appropriate for the limit @xmath66 , while @xmath67 corresponds to the @xmath25 order , suitable for @xmath68 .",
    "in addition to these two magnetic orderings , we consider in our calculations few intermediate spiral orders , as allowed by the size of the clusters on which the simulations are performed . indeed , given an @xmath69 cluster with periodic boundary conditions , the allowed @xmath59 s are given by @xmath70 , with @xmath71 being an integer . besides this class of spiral states",
    ", we also consider states with collinear order in the limit @xmath72 , i.e. , states with @xmath73 and @xmath74 or @xmath75 , see fig  [ fig : orders ] right panel , as suggested in ref .  .",

    "the fact of having a non - trivial pattern of magnetic fluxes in the kinetic part of the non - interacting hamiltonian could be surprising .",
    "however , on the square lattice , we have shown that the best variational wave function can be constructed by considering both nel order and superconducting pairing with @xmath86 symmetry in the non - interacting hamiltonian ,  @xcite which is equivalent to having non - trivial magnetic fluxes . also in the triangular lattice",

    "in this paper , we performed a systematic vmc study of the heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular lattice , for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , namely going from the unfrustrated square lattice ( @xmath127 ) to the isotropic triangular lattice ( @xmath179 ) and then from it to a set of decoupled chains ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "in particular , we constructed correlated wave functions for spiral magnetic orders and compared them with spin - liquid states obtained from the fermionic projective symmetry group classification of ref .  .",
    "given the fact that these two families of variational states are written with the same language ( abrikosov fermions and spin - spin jastrow factor ) , magnetic and non - magnetic states are treated on the same ground .",
    "the final sketch of the vmc phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] .    starting from the unfrustrated case with @xmath127 and increasing the frustrating ratio up to @xmath165 , the ground state exhibits nel order .",
    "notice that , since at the classical level the nel state is stable up to @xmath180 , we have a clear indication that quantum fluctuations favor the collinear magnetic order against coplanar spirals .",
    "then , for @xmath4 , magnetic states with generic pitch vectors ( along the border of the brillouin zone ) and a @xmath109 gapless spin liquid have very similar energies . on the @xmath158 cluster that has been mainly used in our numerical simulations ,",
    "the spiral state has @xmath160 and we can not resolve the competition between this state and the spin - liquid one , the difference between their energies being of the order of @xmath181 . finally , for @xmath182 , the ground state is expected to have magnetic order , with a pitch angle that continuously changes and reaches @xmath67 for @xmath153 , as suggested by the color gradient in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] . on the @xmath158 cluster",
    ", we can only consider a further spiral state with @xmath161 ( besides the @xmath177 order with @xmath67 ) , which gives the best variational energy for @xmath175 .    although the heisenberg model is not fully appropriate to describe organic charge - transfer salts , which are only moderately correlated , we observe that the parameter region where the spin - liquid _ ansatz _ is competitive with magnetic states corresponds to the regime that is relevant for the spin - liquid compound @xmath6-(et)@xmath7cu@xmath7(cn)@xmath10 and for the pd(dmit)@xmath7 salts that do not order magnetically .",
    "@xcite since , for the heisenberg model , our present results suggest that the system is predominantly magnetic , charge fluctuations are expected to play an important role in stabilizing a non - magnetic ground state .    on the other side of the phase diagram , starting from the isotropic triangular lattice and reducing the inter - chain coupling @xmath0 , we expect to have spiral order in the vicinity of the isotropic point . on the @xmath158 lattice",
    ", we clearly see the stabilization of a magnetic state with @xmath183 for @xmath184 . unfortunately , due to the finite size of the cluster , it is extremely difficult to follow in detail the evolution of the pitch vector as a function of @xmath185 .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that spiral phases are stabilized for @xmath186 . for @xmath5",
    ", we obtain a clear indication that a gapless spin - liquid phase can be stabilized , in agreement with previous vmc calculations .",
    "@xcite in contrast , our results suggest that the gapped spin liquid that has been proposed to appear close to the isotropic point  @xcite is defeated by magnetically ordered states . in order to further check this outcome",
    ", we have also performed a green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) calculation ,  @xcite with the fixed - node approximation ,  @xcite at @xmath187 and @xmath188 , by using both the best spin - liquid and the best magnetic state as trial wave functions .",
    "our results show that the energy obtained by applying the gfmc method on the magnetic trial state is slightly lower ( orders of @xmath189 ) than both the one obtained by using a non - magnetic trial state and the one reported in ref .",
    "( where the gapped spin - liquid state has been originally proposed ) . therefore , our present results do not support the presence of a gapped spin liquid when @xmath190 .",
    "our finding that a gapless spin liquid is present in the weakly - coupled chain limit @xmath5 is compatible with previous claims on cs@xmath7cucl@xmath13 , which shows no magnetic order down to very small temperatures , with presumably gapless spin excitations , and is characterized by @xmath18 .",
    "our results are also compatible with the recently discovered spin - liquid material @xmath6-(et)@xmath7b(cn)@xmath13 , where a coupling ratio @xmath191 has been extracted from magnetic susceptibility measurements .",
    "finally , we notice that , according to our numerical results , there is a striking difference between the ground - state properties with @xmath23 , which should be magnetically disordered ( or at most with a small antiferromagnetism with collinear order ) , and @xmath22 , which should correspond to spiral magnetic order .",
    "since cs@xmath7cubr@xmath13 is marked by having incommensurate spin correlations , the larger value of @xmath185 seems to be more appropriate for its low - energy description .",
