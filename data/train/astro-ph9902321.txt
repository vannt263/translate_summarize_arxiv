    "gravitational interactions have been proposed as a triggering mechanism for seyfert - type activity since the early 70 s .",
    "the interaction - agn connection is now part of the standard paradigm of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , for recent discussions emerging from different perspectives ) .",
    "gravitational disturbances are expected to be effective in transferring angular momentum on scales of hundreds of parsecs ( e. g. @xcite , and references therein ) , even though observational tests have produced somewhat sparse or mixed results .",
    "the agn - interaction connection has been investigated following two main observational approaches : _ statistical _ : counts of the number of galaxies near to galaxies hosting seyfert nuclei and _ specific _ : studies of the kinematics and dynamics of ionized gas in spiral disks and circumnuclear regions of individual seyferts .",
    "both methods have drawbacks : present - day observational techniques are not ideal for large scale studies that are needed for a proper survey of companions within @xmath5 1 mpc , and we are unable to resolve structure within which nuclear activity seems to be confined ( @xmath6 1 pc ) .",
    "several statistical papers based on sky surveys have added important insight , even if some of them obtained contradictory results ( @xcite ; @xcite analyze the origins of such disagreement ) .",
    "the most firm result is probably a significant excess of bright companions in the vicinity of seyfert 2 galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "restricting the attention to dynamical studies of disk gas , direct observational evidence in favor of interaction - driven neutral , molecular or ionized gas infall toward the nucleus on scale of several hundreds of parsecs remains scant .",
    "successful observations require a special time in the evolution of an interacting system , and detailed observations of gas morphology and kinematics .",
    "perhaps only in the triple system ngc 7592 spectroscopic evidence of ionized gas infalling toward the seyfert nucleus has been convincingly found ( @xcite ) .",
    "ugc  3995 was selected as part of a larger investigation on the effects of interaction on the gaseous component in a small set of galaxies where activity might have been induced by mass - tranfer of tidally stripped gas from a companion .",
    "ugc  3995 is a bright pair of spiral galaxies with partially overlapping disks and negligible redshift difference that , at first glance , offers the possibility of direct evidence in favor of tidal stripping and/or more quiescent cross fueling into an active nucleus : a bright filament appears to connect the seyfert 2 nucleus of ugc  3995a with the nucleus of ugc  3995b over @xmath0 29.2 arcsec of angular distance , which corresponds to @xmath09 kpc of projected linear distance ( see fig .",

    "the earliest investigations pointed out the peculiar nature of ugc 3995 .",
    "ugc  3995 has been included in the catalog of isolated pairs of galaxies ( cpg 140 , @xcite ) where it is assigned the strongest interaction class lin(br+ta ) intended to indicate the presence of tidal tails and bridges .",

    "@xcite first identified the nucleus of ugc  3995a as having seyfert 2 properties ; he suggested that the ugc  3995 system was `` a close pair of spirals one of which has a type 2 seyfert nucleus and apparent knotty jet '' .",
    "more recently , a report based on integral field spectroscopy , and high spatial resolution ( @xcite ) suggested that gas may be infalling toward the active nucleus in the central regions of the ugc  3995 system .    from our data ,",
    "unambiguous evidence for interaction and gas transfer is difficult to find in the ugc3995 pair .",

    "our r - band image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] ) suggests that the distorted appearance of the bright filament joining ugc  3995a and ugc  3995b is almost entirely due to the foreground spiral arms of ugc  3995b ( and to dust lanes associated with them ) , which cross the hammer - shaped bar like sickle blades .",
    "the eastern spiral arm of ugc 3995a obscures the bar of ugc3995a at its nw end , creating the illusion of a filamentary region ( the highest surface brightness part of the bridge , which appear `` semi - detached '' from the inner part of the ugc 3995a bar ) in between the nuclei of ugc 3995a and b ( clearly visible in both fig .",

    "the radial velocity demonstrates that knot 13 belongs to ugc 3995a and is seen through the disk of b. the ratio /@xmath0 0.4 suggests that it is an region located at the end of a `` semi - detached '' high surface brightness region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "it may be therefore part of the `` bridge . ''",
    "knot 13 is in any case difficult to explain if ugc3995a and b is a chance projection .",
    "\\3 ) the northern arm of ugc 3995a has a more diffuse appearance , suggesting the possibility of a perturbation .",
    "this is appreciable especially in the poss plates and in the b image after subtraction of the two dimensional galaxy models ( not shown ) .",
    "\\4 ) the bright filament motivated the `` bridge '' classification in the cpg . as a matter of fact",
    ", the bridge appears to be due to : ( a ) the nw side of the ugc 3995a bar ; ( b ) the `` semi detached '' high surface brightness region , which includes the nw end of the hammer shaped bar isolated by the eastern arm of ugc 3995a ; ( c ) a region that includes ugc 3995 - 13 , which appears to join the other features to the nucleus of ugc 3995b . a model based on reflection of the unobscured end of the ugc 3995a bar , coupled with the overlapping spiral arms of ugc 3995b ,",
    "does not entirely explain the extension of the `` semi - detached '' feature , which may have been tidally deformed .",
    "however , the nature of region ( c ) is not free of ambiguity because the surface brightness measured on the hst image appears to be only marginally higher ( @xmath6 20% ) than its symmetric counterpart on the western side of ugc 3995b . on the r image , which is contaminated by  emission ,",
    "the surface brightness difference is more evident .",
    "\\5 ) as noted in   [ morph ] , the western arm of ugc 3995b appears to extend much farther than its symmetric counterpart . the two arms are reflections of one another for the first 180@xmath57 of winding .",
    "the western arm extends towards component a and crosses the circumnuclear region of that galaxy .",
    "it is visible as a prominent dust lane , especially , on the hst image .",
    "it is tempting to ascribe the extension as evidence of interaction and the analogy to the extension of an arm of m51 towards its companion is obvious ( e. g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the apparent lack of symmetry for the eastern and western spiral arm of ugc 3995a may be due only to the lack of background emission on the western side of ugc 3995b : the eastern extension of the western arm can be noted only because it adsorbs light from ugc 3995a .",
    "concluding , the most robust evidence of interaction is due to the brighter  emission on the eastern side of ugc 3995b , and to region ugc 3995 - 13 , which is right at the end of the high - surface brightness distortion of the bar ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) . other features ( points ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) above ) are more ambiguous in their interpretation .      the relative orientation of ugc 3995a and b is well constrained .",
    "the sc galaxy ugc  3995b is oriented almost face - on ( @xmath58 8@xmath1 ) and is located in front of the sbbc galaxy ugc  3995a ( @xmath58 60@xmath1 ) .",
    "component b partially obscures the western side of component a. if spiral arms trail then the northern side of ugc  3995a is the near side . a similar consideration suggests that the southern side of ugc 3995b is nearer .",
    "however , the line of nodes for ugc 3995b is unconstrained .",
    "a dominant velocity component along the e @xmath59 w direction would imply a prograde encounter .",
    "the system does not show any of the morphological features expected from such a prograde encounter _ after _",
    "closest approach .",
    "the global symmetry of both galaxies is more consistent with an encounter stage before perigalacticon . in this case",
    ", the western arm of ugc 3995b could have been really distorted towards ugc 3995a as the two galaxies should have already passed in front of each other on the plane of the sky ( see point ( 5 ) of  [ int ] ) .",
    "the observed  21 cm profile argues against the prograde encounter scenario , as any velocity perturbation of disk gas ( not to be confused with the orbital velocity of the two galaxies ) would have to be entirely on the plane of the sky .",
    "the alternative possibility involves a velocity component along the direction",
    "w @xmath59 e. in this case , the encounter would be retrograde , with the two galaxies either before or after their closest approach . among interacting seyfert galaxies",
    ", a significant fraction appears to undergo a retrograde encounter ( @xcite )",
    ". a retrograde encounter may be as efficient as a prograde one in driving gas from the inner central parsecs of a gas rich galaxy like ugc 3995a toward the central black hole .",
    "a retrograde encounter is consistent with the unperturbed appearance of the  disk , and with the presence of localized star formation in knots along the spiral arms",
    ". a retrograde encounter , always assuming that the galaxies are at , or close to perigalacticon , would not produce large - scale distortions .",
    "test particles in a restricted three body simulation are subject to forces pulling them alternatively inward and outward , with little net result ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these kind of forces are expected to enhance the probability of molecular cloud collisions , and hence to favor localized star formation especially in spiral arms , as observed in ugc 3995 .",
    "the bar appears strong , regular , and dominated by stellar emission .",
    "a tidal perturbation due to the proximity of a companion may be enough to induce the formation of such a bar , which is though to facilitate inflow of gas toward the center ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "strong bars are though to be only a transient phase in the life of galaxy , and form relatively quickly , in a time that can be comparable to the dynamical timescale at the end of the bar of ugc 3995a ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results are consistent with our suggestion that the encounter is recent .",
    "in addition , recent work has shown that bars are more frequent in seyfert 2 than in seyfert 1 galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found clear evidence of a sequence of bar incidence that decreases from /starburst galaxies , through liners , seyfert 2 and seyfert 1 .",
    "an important conclusion of these authors is that this sequence can be interpreted as an evolutionary sequence in time , dependent also on the interaction strength ( or on the strength of any other non - axisymmetric perturbation ) .",
    "ugc 3995 could be seen as an `` early '' seyfert 2 according to this scheme .",
    "it is most likely that the gaseous component in the eastern part of the disk of ugc 3995b ( enhanced  emission on the side closest to ugc 3995a ) , and also in the western part of ugc 3995a ( nw end of bar , region 13 ) has been affected by the encounter ( see  [ results ] and  [ disc ] ) .",
    "the relative orientation , motion and morphologies of ugc  3995a and b are most consistent if the two galaxies are not widely separated but are in the early stages of their encounter .",
    "the presence of an active nucleus in an early stage encounter apparently does not pose a problem , since gas in the circumnuclear regions may reach the nucleus on time scales comparable to the dynamical timescale ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "if the encounter is prograde , then the two galaxies should be before their first closest approach . otherwise , the galaxy orientation and motions , and especially the unperturbed  profile are consistent with a retrograde encounter .",
