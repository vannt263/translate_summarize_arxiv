    "the reasons to perform event - by - event azimuthal angle fluctuations were to investigate plasma instabilities @xcite , search for the critical point and onset of deconfinement , and measure fluctuations of elliptic flow @xcite . in this work",
    "the @xmath0 measure @xcite is chosen as it is a strongly intensive measure of fluctuations ( does not depend on volume and on volume fluctuations ) .",
    "the @xmath0 measure was already successfully used by na49 to study average @xmath27 fluctuations @xcite and charge fluctuations @xcite .",
    "there are several other effects that influence the values of this measure , such as resonance decays , momentum conservation , flow , and quantum statistics .",
    "the @xmath0 measure is not well suited to the analysis of these effects which represent a background for the present study .",
    "let @xmath1 be a particle s azimuthal production angle .",
    "one can define a single - particle variable @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an average over the single - particle inclusive azimuthal angle distribution .",
    "let us also define an event variable @xmath30 , where the summation runs over particles in a given event .",
    "then the @xmath2 measure is defined as :    @xmath31 ,    where @xmath32 represents averaging over events .",
    "when particles are emitted by a number ( @xmath33 ) of identical sources , which are independent of each other and @xmath34 is the distribution of this number , then @xmath35 is independent of @xmath36 ( an intensive measure ) and its distribution @xmath34 ( a strongly intensive measure ) .",
    "additionally , if particles are produced independently ( no inter - particle correlations ) , @xmath2 equals zero .",
    "general properties of the @xmath2 measure were already studied using analytical calculations @xcite .",
    "fluctuations due to elliptic flow , quantum statistics and resonance decays in the hadron gas were evaluated . in this paper we present model studies that were conducted to investigate in detail the behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "several toy models were employed to test separately the influence of various physics effects .",
    "full event generators such as urqmd @xcite , pythia @xcite , and hijing @xcite were used as a direct reference to experimental results .      to simulate elliptic flow events",
    "were generated with azimuthal angle distribution of particles following @xmath37 .",
    "for each event the reaction plane angle @xmath38 was generated from a flat distribution in azimuthal angle , and the multiplicity n of particles in an event was taken from a negative binomial distribution with given @xmath39 and dispersion @xmath40 .",
    "the value of @xmath41 was a simulation parameter , constant for each simulation series ( fig .",

    "moreover , event - by - event fluctuations in @xmath41 cause an additional increase of @xmath2 values .    to simulate global momentum conservation ( fig .",
    "[ zachowanie ] ) , each particle had its transverse momentum @xmath27 drawn from the distribution @xmath44 , where @xmath45 mev , and its azimuthal angle from a flat distribution .",
    "afterwards , for every particle @xmath46 and @xmath47 was modified : @xmath48 , and @xmath49 to obey momentum conservation in the whole event ( @xmath50 is the event multiplicity generated from a negative binomial distribution ) .",
    "results show negative @xmath2 values ( anti - correlation ) which weakly depend on multiplicity .",
    "a simulation using urqmd 3.3 was performed for p+p collisions in a wide energy range ( sps , rhic , lhc ) ( fig . [ urqmd_pp ] ) .",
    "default parameters of the generator were used , which for this version means simulation of hard processes ( for energies @xmath51 gev ) , but no hydrodynamics stage .",

    "the na49 experiment @xcite at the cern sps operated between 1994 and 2002 .",

    "it is a fixed target hadron spectrometer ( four tpcs , two of them , vtpc-1 and vtpc-2 , inside a magnetic field ) with precise determination of the collision centrality ( forward calorimeter measuring energy of projectile spectators ) .",
    "the na49 detector has a limited azimuthal angle acceptance ; the acceptance losses are concentrated mainly around the up - down regions . due to the magnetic field in vtpc-1/2 particles of opposite charge are almost completely separated in the mtpcs ( fig .",
