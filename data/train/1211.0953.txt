    "these analysis did not include relativistic mass effects in the plasma response ( and therefore did not include relativistic drifts ) and were applied to a code that solved the scalar and vector potential using the coulomb gauge .",
    "however , most present day codes solve directly for the electric and magnetic fields and use a rigorous charge conserving current deposition .",
    "recent results indicate that there is only an instability in 2d and 3d @xcite .    to better understand and with the hope of mitigating the observed instability , we present here an analysis of the numerical instability for a plasma drifting relativistically in multi - dimensions in which the electric field @xmath1 and magnetic field @xmath2 are solved for directly and where only a current deposit is included .",
    "we follow the basic method and notation of @xcite and concentrate on situations where the plasma is cold but is drifting near the speed of light . the dispersion relation can be applied for various maxwell field solvers and it includes finite size particle and aliasing effects .",
    "the dispersion relation reduces to purely longitudinal plasma waves and purely transverse light waves in a drifting plasma in the appropriate limits .",
    "the dispersion relation predicts the growth rates and range ( pattern ) of unstable modes in fourier space . by comparing the theoretical predictions against the simulation results using the em - pic fdtd code osiris @xcite and the ucla pic framework @xcite which is based on spectral solver ,",
    "we conclude that the observed instability is indeed induced by the relativistic plasma drift ( and not due to under - resolved backscattered radiation ) .",
    "it is found that the unstable modes lie near the intersection between beam modes and transverse em modes .",
    "we use this fact to develop asymptotic expressions for the instability growth rate .",

    "our dispersion relation now predicts the time steps for which the minimal instability growth rate was observed after reading ref .",
    "we then use these results as a guide to discuss the methods for mitigating this instability .",
    "it is found that by using a spectral solver to advance the em field in fourier space ( which supports light waves with phase velocity greater than plasma drifting velocity ) , we can obtain desirable patterns of the instability which makes the mitigation of it more convenient . to better explore the instability in 3d scenario",

    "the parameter scan using the asymptotic expression for the karkkainen solver with ec scheme shows the `` magic time step '' at around @xmath164 , which agrees with the results reported in ref .",
    "however , according to our simulation and theoretical results , we found the `` magic time step '' not only in karkkainen solver , but also in yee solver ; and not only for ec scheme , but also for mc scheme .",
    "this is also reported in @xcite for the 2d cases .",
    "the fact that the `` magic time step '' @xmath161 does not depend on @xmath157 for square ( and cubic ) cell for the yee and karkkainen solver is evident from eq .",

    "we emphasized trying to understand the source of the instability and the structures of the dispersion relation .",

    "maxwell solvers , such as spectral solvers , that have em waves with phase velocities greater than the plasma drifting velocity are therefore free of any instability due to the main beam mode .",
    "we showed that the use of a spectral solver does indeed eliminate any instability from the main beam mode , leading to instability predominantly from coupling between the em wave and the lowest order aliased beam modes .",

    "we showed that a low pass filter with a hard cutoff can eliminate these modes without effecting lower @xmath175 modes that are physically important in a properly resolved simulation .",
