    "a great effort covering several decades has been devoted to developing full - purpose montecarlo codes ( e.g. @xcite , see @xcite for a more general review ) for high - energy hard processes .",
    "however , the most known codes do not allow for simulation of effects like azimuthal asymmetries in sidis , in @xmath0 @xmath1 hadrons , in drell - yan processes etc , i.e. those processes where the transverse spin of the quark has a relevance ( for an overview of this field , see the proceedings @xcite , and the reviews @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "although it is possible to modify a monte carlo generator in such a way to produce such asymmetries , the perspective of touching the core of such complicate codes is surely a nightmare for most of the people that are potentially interested in .",
    "what i present here is a set of techniques aimed at introducing ( transverse ) spin physics in a generator without touching it at all . of course one needs writing patches of code , but these use the parton level and hadron level outputs of the generator as an input , and are completely independent ( small ) programs .    in this work ,",
    "i will consider @xmath0 @xmath1 hadrons .",
    "i will start from events generated by pythia-8 @xcite .",
    "i need to modify pythia outputs in such a way that :    \\(i ) in the hard vertex @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath4 , transverse polarizations are added to the quark and to the antiquark , and the correlated distribution of spins and momenta is coherent with the known matrix elements .",
    "\\(ii ) the momenta of the final hadrons in each hemisphere ( quark hemisphere and antiquark hemisphere ) are modified in a way that is correlated with the transverse spin of the parent quark .",
    "the modification must be under our full control , i.e. we should be able to obtain exactly what we want to obtain .",
    "this may mean a fragmentation function with pre - assigned form , or the implementation of a model .",
    "i will describe some techniques to implement the previous requirements . as an example",
    ", i will apply them to modify pion final momenta so to have them distributed according with the sum of an unpolarized and a collins fragmentation function@xcite .",
    "although here i just want to show an example of application of these simulation techniques , the chosen case is of special interest , since the collins function has a relevant role in the extraction of information on the transverse polarization of the nucleon@xcite , there are models for it @xcite , and it appears in asymmetries measured in sidis @xcite and @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xcite .    as a consequence of a nonzero collins function ,",
    "the correlated distribution of pions detected in opposite hemispheres is expected to present a @xmath6 asymmetry in the sum of the azimuthal angles of the pions @xcite ( see section viii of @xcite for details ) .",
    "this will be confirmed by an analysis of the events generated by pythia and modified as suggested here .",
    "i will not try to reproduce the detailed physical outputs of the recent measurement of this quantity at belle @xcite , because this is just an exercise and the aim of this work is to present a more general group of techniques .",
    "once the individual hadron tracks have been modified in a physically motivated way , other azimuthal asymmetries could be generated in a set of simulated events , like the @xmath7asymmetry ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , or dihadron - dihadron correlations @xcite , or even asymmetries associated with a larger number of particles@xcite .",
    "let me name npmc the `` non polarized '' montecarlo code whose outputs have to be modified by the external patches .",
    "the two main steps , corresponding to previous ( i ) and ( ii ) are :    step ( 1 ) : take a @xmath4 pair produced in the hard vertex by the npmc and `` stick '' a pair of reciprocally independent random transverse spins , in such a way that the correlated spin - momentum distribution agrees with the polarized quark - lepton squared matrix element .",
    "transverse spins are assumed to be classical fixed - length vectors with one degree of freedom ( the angle in the plane that is normal to the quark momentum ) .",
    "this step is the critical point of the method .",
    "it needs to be demonstrated that it is feasible .",
    "one thing is to sort both momenta and spins according with a joint distribution , and another thing is first sorting momenta according with the spin - averaged distribution ( that is done by the npmc ) , and next dividing the sorted events into fairly distributed spin subsets ( that is done by us ) .",
    "section 2 is devoted to this .",
    "step ( 2 ) : modify the ( final or intermediate ) hadronic momenta so to reproduce the effect of an assigned quark - spin - dependent fragmentation function .",
    "alternatively , one could like to implement a physical model that is behind this fragmentation function .    here",
    "the underlying assumption is that azimuthal effects are a @xmath8 distortion of a final particle distribution that is mainly determined by the physics implemented in the npmc .",
    "there are two classes of techniques that may be exploited : `` distortion '' , and `` filtering '' techniques . in distortion techniques the individual particle properties in a given event",
    "are modified .",
    "these techniques exploit each event produced by the npmc .",
    "in filtering techniques only a subset of the events produced by the npmc is accepted .",
    "filtering may be expensive , when many npmc - events are needed to obtain one final event .",
    "it may be necessary when we think that the additional physical processes affect quantities like the final pion multiplicity , or the general structure of the event . if we do not expect this to be the case , distortion techniques are preferable .    in section 3",
    ", i show the effect of two possible distortion techniques in producing a nonzero collins function for the pions .",
    "a @xmath3asymmetry involving pions of the opposite hemispheres is a synthesis of the presence of collins functions on both sides , and of the spin correlations between the quark and antiquark produced in the hard vertex .",
    "so , if things in the steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have been properly performed it must be present .",
    "section 4 is devoted to show that this is the case , i.e. that a @xmath3asymmetry is present in a set of pythia - events modified by the presented techniques .",
    "in most montecarlo codes for high - energy physics , the starting point is the hard scattering process at parton level .",

    "the first aim of these modifications is attributing a transverse spin to the quark and to the antiquark pair produced in the hard vertex , in such a way to get a physically sound distribution for the correlated set of quark momenta and spins produced in the hard vertex .",

    "the former group is suitable for producing final distributions according with fragmentation functions of the form @xmath132 , where @xmath38 is the unpolarized fragmentation function and @xmath133 a spin - dependent term , like e.g. a collins function .",
    "the `` convolution '' techniques are more appropriate for those cases where a model predicts that the final moment is a convolution of two contributions , one due to the unpolarized physics , and the other one to polarization - related effects .    as a test case ,",
    "this has been applied to modification of a set of pythia events , so to produce an azimuthal asymmetry that derives from the combined effect of the collins functions of two opposite - produced pions .",
