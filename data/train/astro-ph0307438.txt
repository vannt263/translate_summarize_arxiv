    "in earlier work ( robertson & leiter 2002 ) we presented evidence for the existence of intrinsic magnetic moments of @xmath0 g @xmath1 in galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) .",
    "these findings are recapitulated and extended in table 1 and appendix d , which summarizes the equations and the analysis of observations . combined with rotation rates in the range 10 - 50",
    "hz , these magnetic moments provide a robust unified mechanism for the spectral state switches observed in gbhc and neutron stars ( ns ) , a common origin of quiescent power - law emissions as spin - down luminosity , and a unified driving mechanism for the ubiquitous low - state jets and synchrotron emissions of both .",
    "magnetosphere topology also serves to stabilize the inner accretion disk ( arons et al .",
    "the great strength of the magnetospheric model that we describe is that it allows a unified description of all of the various spectral and luminosity states of x - ray novae , whether ns or gbhc",
    ". similarities of ns and gbhc properties , particularly in low and quiescent states , have been previously noted , ( e.g. van der klis 1994 , tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) as well as the lack of compelling evidence for event horizons ( abramowicz , kluzniak & lasota 2002 ) .",
    "the central question at this point is , what is the nature of the compact objects that we call gbhc .",
    "there is a plethora of piece meal models of these various phenomena .",
    "for example , comptonizing coronae near event horizons , bulk flow comptonization and magnetic flares on accretion disks have all been invoked to explain the hard spectral tail of low state gbhc . but the observed ingress / egress times for dipping sources imply large radiating regions ( church 2001 ) that are inconsistent with the compact corona models and can be consistent with bulk comptonization models only for large scale outflows .",
    "similarly , radiatively inefficient advective flows at high accretion rates have been proposed to explain the quiescent power - law emissions of gbhc , ( narayan et al .",
    "1997 , garcia et al .",
    "2001 ) . while ignoring the fact that the similar emissions of accreting millisecond pulsars are adequately explained by magnetospheric spin - down .",
    "stated more bluntly , cir x-1 , a burster with a magnetic moment similar to those found for gbhc ( table 1 and iaria et al . 2001 ) , exhibits essentially all of the x - ray spectral and timing characteristics that have been proposed at various times as distinguishing features of black holes .",
    "a unified model of gbhc and ns that can be used to clarify subtle differences is clearly needed .",
    "others have reported evidence for strong magnetic fields in gbhc .",
    "a field in excess of @xmath2 g has been found at the base of the jets of grs 1915 + 105 ( gliozzi , bodo & ghisellini 1999 , vadawale , rao & chakrabarti 2001 ) .",
    "a recent study of optical polarization of cygnus x-1 in its low state ( gnedin et al .",
    "2003 ) has found a slow gbhc spin and a magnetic field of @xmath3 gauss at the location of its optical emission . given the @xmath4 dependence of field strength on magnetic moment , the implied magnetic moments are in good agreement with those we have found . a recent correlation ( mauche et al .",
    "2002 , warner & woudt 2003 ) of quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) frequencies extending over six orders of magnitude in frequency , from dwarf novae to neutron stars shows points for gbhc squarely in the middle of the line .",
    "if the higher of the correlated frequencies is generated where the inner radius of an accretion disk interacts with a magnetosphere ( goodson , bohm & winglee 1999 , titarchuk & wood 2002 ) , this would be additional evidence of intrinsic magnetic moments for gbhc .",
    "a relativistic frame - dragging explanation is surely not applicable .    while accommodating intrinsic magnetic moments in models of gbhc would require revisions in the current theoretical picture of these compact objects ,",
    "such an approach would also greatly simplify the problem of understanding the spectral , timing and jet ejection mechanisms of compact objects .",
    "if gbhc have intrinsic magnetic moments that are not generated by external currents in an accretion disk , then they would not possess event horizons .",
    "as noted by abramowicz , kluzniak & lasota ( 2002 ) , it is unlikely that we will ever find direct observational proof of an event horizon , however , we may be able to observationally determine whether or not gbhc have intrinsic magnetic moments .",
    "if gbhc are not black holes , they would almost certainly be magnetized and likely to at least a degree similar to their compact ns cousins .",
    "although there are widely studied models for generating magnetic fields in accretion disks , most can produce equipartition fields at best ( livio & pringle 1999 ) , perhaps at the expense of being too luminous ( bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 2000 ) in quiescence . while tangled magnetic fields in accretion disks are very likely responsible for their large viscosity , ( e.g. hawley , balbus & winters 1999 ) the highly variable mass accretion rates in lmxb make it unlikely that disk dynamos could produce the stability of fields needed to account for either spectral state switches or quiescent spin - down luminosities .",
    "both also require magnetic fields co - rotating with the central object .",
    "further , if disk dynamos produced the much larger apparent magnetic moments of gbhc , they should produce them also for the ns systems and cause profound qualitative spectral and timing differences via interactions with the intrinsic ns magnetic moments .",
    "such qualitative differences as have been observed , e.g. , the hard spectral tail of the high / soft state , lack of surface bursts for gbhc and stronger gbhc jets , are easily explained by differences in masses and magnetic field strengths .",
    "not only are there are no observed differences that require explanation in terms of event horizons ( abramowicz , kluzniak & lasota 2002 ) , there appear to be none that would be consistent with having two different magnetic structures for ns and gbhc .",
    "it has been suggested that stable magnetic fields could be produced by electrically charged , rotating black holes ( punsley 1998 , gnedin et al .",
    "2003 ) , however the charge necessary to endow cygnus x-1 with a @xmath2 g magnetic field , well out in the accretion disk , was found to be @xmath5 esu ( gnedin et al .",
    "2003 ) . due to the large charge / mass ratios of accreting protons or electrons ,",
    "this quantity of black hole charge would produce electric forces at least @xmath6 larger than the gravitational attraction of @xmath7 , thus causing charges of one sign to be swallowed and the other to be blown away . at accretion rates needed to account for the x - ray luminosity of cygnus x-1 , the original charge",
    "would be neutralized in a fraction of one second .",
    "thus it appears that current black hole models are unable to offer unified explanations of such obviously magnetic phenomena as jets , spectral state switches and quiescent synchrotron emissions and if they could , it seems unusually generous for nature to have provided different mechanisms for ns and gbhc to produce such strikingly similar phenomena .",
    "astrophysicists nowadays generally accept the inevitability of the curvature singularities of black holes , however , if the gbhc are intrinsically magnetized , this will be nature s way of telling us that such singularities are not really permitted to exist .",
    "if so , we are left with the task of finding a fundamental reason for their prohibition . in general relativity ( gr )",
    "the strong principle of equivalence ( spoe ) requires that special relativity ( sr ) must hold locally for freely falling time - like observers in all of spacetime .",
    "this spoe requirement is a tensor relationship that implies that ( i ) the spacetime manifold for observers located in field - free regions , distant from gravitating masses , must approach the flat spacetime of sr and ( ii ) the spacetime world lines of massive matter must always be timelike . at the schwarzschild radius",
    "is sufficient to cause free - fall geodesics of test particles in non - singular finkelstein or kerr - schild coordinates , for constant central mass , to become null at the event horizon , though the crossing can at least be accomplished in a finite coordinate time , as well as proper time , for kerr - schild .",
    "see appendix a. it has been shown ( leiter & robertson 2003 ) that null geodesics occur at surfaces of infinite redshift . in kruskal - szekeres coordinates , in which @xmath8 does not vanish , there is no surface of infinite redshift at the schwarzschild radius and timelike test particle geodesics can traverse it _ in either direction _",
    ", so long as the initial conditions are chosen in a manner that permits the ` time ' coordinate to change in a positive sense .",
    "however , a central singularity still exists in these coordinates and they can not apply to a gravitational collapse process ( weinberg 1972 , rindler 1977 ) nor can they describe the distant asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "they do , however , have a surface of infinite redshift as @xmath9 , at which outgoing geodesics become null .",
    "thus they appear to have no applicability to astrophysics .",
    "] such spacetime manifolds are known as ` bundle complete ' ( wheeler & ciuofolini 1995 ) .    as a guiding principle",
    ", we look for solutions of the einstein equations that satisfy the spoe requirement that the world lines of physical matter under the influence of both gravitational and non - gravitational forces must not be allowed to become null or spacelike in any region of spacetime .",
    "since the energy - momentum tensor serves as both a source of curvature in the einstein equations and a generator of the equations of motion of matter , any constraints on the latter will affect the former . hence to assure ` timelike world line completeness ' , the right hand side of the gr field equation @xmath10 must contain non - gravitational elements capable of stopping the collapse of physical matter before the formation of a ` trapped surface ' , thus dynamically avoiding the hawking and penrose theorem which states that once a trapped surface is formed , an event horizon and curvature singularities are unavoidable .    in this context , we have found that it is possible to virtually stop and maintain a collapsing compact physical plasma object outside of its schwarzschild radius with photon pressure generated by synchrotron radiation from an equipartition magnetic field , though the object must then radiate at the local eddington limit .",
    "there is strong recent evidence for the presence of such extreme magnetic fields in gravitational collapse .",
    "equipartition magnetic fields have been implicated as the driver of grb 021206 ( coburn & boggs 2003 ) and strong residual fields much in excess of those expected from mere flux compression during stellar collapse have been found in magnetars ( ibrahim , swank & parke 2003 ) .",
    "kluzniak and ruderman ( 1998 ) have described the generation of @xmath11 g magnetic fields via differential rotation in neutron stars .",
    "it is likely that larger fields might be generated for the more massive gbhc .",
    "an equipartition field would have @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is magnetic field strength and @xmath14 the mass density .",
    "generating @xmath15 g , for nuclear densities , should be possible via differential rotation and relativistic field compression as surface redshift increases from the vicinity of @xmath16 during the final adiabatic decay of core neutrino emissions .",
    "other possibilities for producing extreme magnetic fields would include ferromagnetic phase transitions during the collapse ( haensel & bonnazzola 1996 , j. noble private communication ) or the formation of quark condensates .",
    "fields of this order have been modeled for quark condensates ( tatsumi 2000 ) , who notes that quark liquids can undergo a ferromagnetic phase transition at densities as low as nuclear saturation .",
    "an equipartition magnetic field seems to be a necessary part of a mechanism to ensure the spoe requirement for timelike worldline completeness .    at the temperatures and compactness of stellar collapse",
    ", a pair plasma is produced .",
    "pelletier & marcowith ( 1998 ) have shown that the energy density of magnetic perturbations in equipartition pair plasmas is preferentially converted to photon pressure , rather than causing particle acceleration .",
    "the radiative power of an equipartition pair plasma is proportional to @xmath17 , ( pair density @xmath18 and synchrotron energy production @xmath19 . )",
    "lacking the equipartition pair plasma , magnetic stress , @xmath20 , and gravitational stress , @xmath21 , on mass density @xmath14 , would both increase as @xmath22 during gravitational collapse .",
    "magnetic fields below equipartition levels would be incapable of stopping the collapse .",
    "however , since photon pressure generated by the pairs at equipartition increases more rapidly than gravitational stresses , it is possible to stabilize the rate of collapse at an eddington limit rate . with this extremely efficient photon production mechanism",
    ", the radiation temperature is buffered near the pair production threshhold . in effect , the rate of collapse is buffered by a phase transition .",
    "for equipartition conditions , the field also exceeds that required to confine the pair plasma . a stable rate of collapse",
    "is maintained by increased ( decreased ) photon pressure ( @xmath23 ) if the field is increased ( decreased ) by compresssion or expansion .",
    "since the photon luminosity is not confined to the core it will not be trapped , as occurs with neutrinos , however , the radiation should be thermalized as it diffuses through an optically thick environment . _ to reduce the field to the distantly observed levels implied by our previous gbhc studies would require the existence of a red shift of @xmath24 .",
    "thus we are motivated by the spoe to look for solutions of the gr field equations that are consistent with eddington limited , highly redshifted , gravitational collapse . _ the residual , distantly observed magnetic moment and extremely faint , redshifted radiations would be the only things that would distinguish such an object from a black hole ( abramowicz , kluzniak & lasota 2002 ) .    in section 3",
    "we show that strict enforcement of the spoe requirement for timelike world line completeness leads to a ` no trapped surface ' condition . in section 4",
    "we show that the gravitational collapse of a magnetospheric , eternally collapsing object ( meco ) that radiates at its local eddington limit would continue for a duration exceeding a hubble time . in sections 5 - 10",
    ", we examine other physical characteristics of meco .",
    "the simplest form of the energy - momentum tensor , which can satisfy the spoe requirement of time like world line completeness , is one which describes a collapsing , radiating plasma containing equipartiton magnetic fields which emit outgoing radiation . between the extremes of pure magnetic energy ( thorne 1965 ) and weakly magnetic , radiation dominated polytropic gases or pressureless dust ( baumgarte & shapiro 2003 ) there should be cases where the rate of collapse can be stable .",
    "to first order , in an eddington limited radiation dominated context , these can be described by the energy momentum tensor : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 describes outgoing radiation in a geometric optics approximation , @xmath14 is energy density of matter and @xmath28 the pressure .",
    "energy momentum tensors corresponding to metrics describing ingoing radiation , which are used in many black hole model calculations , ( e.g. baumgarte & shapiro 2003 ) can not be used here because they are incompatible with the @xmath29 boundary conditions associated with collapsing , outwardly radiating objects .",
    "we choose a comoving interior metric given by @xmath30 and an exterior vaidya metric with outgoing radiation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the areal radius and @xmath33 is the retarded observer time . following lindquist , schwarz & misner ( 1965 ) , we define @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a proper length element in a zero angular momentum comoving frame , @xmath39 an increment of proper time , @xmath40 is the proper time rate of change of the radius associated with the invariant circumference of the collapsing mass , and @xmath41 is the mass enclosed within this radius .",
    "the last two of the relations above have been obtained from the @xmath42 component of the field equation ( lindquist , schwarz & misner 1965 ) . at the boundary of the collapsing , radiating surface , s , we find that the proper time will be positive definite , as required for timelike world line completeness if @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the distantly observed redshift of the collapsing surface . from equation ( 9 )",
    "we see that in order to avoid a violation of the requirement of timelike world line completenes for @xmath45 , it is necessary to dynamically enforce the ` no trapped surface condition ' field equation in a zero angular momentum comoving frame produces the ` no trapped surface condition ' for any interior r(r , t ) , provided that b(r , t ) does not become singular at a location where a(r , t ) vanishes",
    ". however this requirement will be satisfied as long as timelike world line completeness is maintained by photon pressure generated by the equipartition magnetic field everywhere in the comoving frame .",
    "we can consider any interior location and the radiation flux there without requiring a joined vaidya metric .",
    "but there will ultimately be an outer radiating boundary and the required match to the non - singular outgoing exterior vaidya metric guarantees that there will be no metric singularity there . ] : @xmath46 since there is nothing in the einstein tensor @xmath47 that enforces this condition , we must rely on non - gravitational forces in @xmath48 to enforce the spoe condition of time like world line completeness .",
    "for the meco model , we use radiation pressure where @xmath49 at the comoving meco surface the luminosity is @xmath50 and the distantly observed luminosity is @xmath51",
    "among the various equations associated with the collapse process there are three proper time differential equations applicable to a compact collapsing and radiating physical surface . when evaluated on the physical surface ( hernandez jr .",
    "& misner , 1966 , lindquist , schwartz & misner 1965 , misner 1965 , lindquist , 1966 ) these equations are : @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 in eddington limited steady collapse , the conditions @xmath55 and @xmath56 hold after some time , @xmath57 , that has elaspsed in reaching the eddington limited state .",
    "then @xmath58 where @xmath59 includes the magnetic field energy in the pressure term and radiant energy in q.    equation ( 17 ) when integrated over a closed surface can be solved for the net outward flow of eddington limited luminosity through the surface .",
    "taking the escape cone factor of @xmath60 into account , ( see appendix a ) the outflowing ( but not all escaping ) surface luminosity , l , would be @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xmath64 is the plasma opacity .",
    "( for simplicity , we have assumed here that the luminosity actually escapes from the meco surface rather than after conveyance through a meco atmosphere and photosphere .",
    "the end result is the same for distant observers . )",
    "however the luminosity @xmath65 which appears in equations ( 15 - 16 ) is actually the net luminosity , which escapes through the photon sphere , and is given by @xmath66 thus in equations 15 and 16 , the @xmath65 appearing there is given by @xmath67 in this context from ( 15 ) we have that @xmath68 which can be integrated to give @xmath69 this yield a distantly observed meco lifetime of @xmath70 yr for @xmath71 .",
    "finally , equation ( 16 ) becomes @xmath72 which , in view of ( 13 ) has the solution @xmath73 which is consistent with ( 8) and ( 10 ) .",
    "if one naively attributes the eddington limit luminosity to purely thermal processes , one quickly finds that the required meco surface temperatures would be so high that photon energies would be well beyond the pair production threshhold and the compactness would assure that photon - photon collisions would produce numerous electron - positron pairs .",
    "thus the meco surface region must be dominated by a pair plasma , and at a temperature buffered near the @xmath74 threshhold for photon - photon collisions to produce pairs ( pelletier & marcowith 1998 ) .",
    "as we shall see , an electron - positron pair atmosphere of a meco is an extremely significant structure that conveys radiation from the meco surface to a zone with a much lower red shift and larger escape cone from which it escapes . in order to describe this process computationally within a numerical grid , a radial grid interval no larger than @xmath75",
    "would be needed , where @xmath76 is the gravitational radius .",
    "although there have been many numerical studies of the behavior of collapsing compact objects in gr , to our knowledge none have indicated that they have sufficient numerical resolution to examine the extreme red shift regime associated with meco nor have they considered the emergent properties of equipartition magnetic fields and pair plasmas at high red shift .",
    "the strength of the poloidal component of the intrinsic magnetic fields @xmath77 observed in the distant environment around the meco are reduced by a factor of @xmath78 from their values near @xmath79 .",
    "the fields needed to produce jets in agn are observed to be of the order @xmath80 gauss as judged distantly . on the other hand",
    ", a distantly observed equipartition field would be @xmath81 gauss , where @xmath82 .",
    "this suggests that for an @xmath83 agn , the combined effect of mass scaling and red shift would need to reduce the surface field from @xmath84 gauss to @xmath85 gauss",
    ". this would require the meco to have a red shift of @xmath86 . in this and previous work , ( robertson & leiter 2002 ) we have found typical magnetic fields of a few times @xmath87 gauss for gbhc .",
    "these would require similar values of @xmath88 , as well as @xmath89 .",
    "therefore for both gbhc and agn we find that we need erg / s ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) were capable of very briefly sustaining a neutrino eddington limit rate of collapse , then the subsequent reduction of neutrino luminosity as neutrino emissions are depleted in the core would lead to an adiabatic collapse , magnetic flux compression , and photon emissions reaching an eddington limit . at this point the photon luminosity would need to support a smaller diameter and more tightly gravitationally bound mass .",
    "a new photon eddington balance would thus require an escaping luminosity reduced by at least the @xmath90 opacity ratio @xmath91 , where @xmath92 @xmath93 is the thompson cross section and @xmath94 @xmath93 is the neutrino scattering cross - section .",
    "thus @xmath95 erg / s would be required . for this to be @xmath96 for a 10 m@xmath97 gbhc would require @xmath98 .",
    "the adiabatic relaxation of neutrino support and formation of a pair plasma is an important step in gravitational collapse that is not encompassed by polytropic equation of state models of collapse .",
    "it is of some interest that if neutrinos have non - zero rest mass they might be trapped inside the photon sphere anyway . ]",
    "the quiescent luminosity of a meco originates deep within its photon sphere . when distantly observed it is diminished by both gravitational red shift and a narrow exit cone .",
    "the gravitational red shift reduces the surface luminosity by @xmath100 while the exit cone further reduces the luminosity by the factor @xmath101 for large z. ( see appendix a ) .",
    "here we have used @xmath102 where r and z refer to the location from which photons escape .",
    "the net outflow fraction of the luminosity provides the support for the collapsing matter , thereby dynamically maintaining the spoe requirement of timelike world line completeness .",
    "the photons which finally escape do so from the photosphere of the pair atmosphere .",
    "the fraction of luminosity from the meco surface that escapes to infinity in eddington balance is @xmath103 the distantly observed luminosity is : @xmath104 when radiation reaches the photosphere , where the temperature is @xmath105 , the fraction that escapes to be distantly observed is : @xmath106 where @xmath107 erg / s/@xmath93 and subscript p refers to conditions at the photosphere .",
    "equations 28 and 29 yield : @xmath108 to examine typical cases , a @xmath7 , @xmath109 gbhc modeled in terms of a meco with @xmath24 would have @xmath110 kev , a bolometric luminosity , excluding spin - down contributions , of @xmath111 , and a spectral peak at 220 a@xmath112 , in the photoelectrically absorbed deep uv . for an m=@xmath113 agn , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and a spectral peak in the near infrared at 7000 a@xmath116 .",

    "hence passive meco without active accretion disks , although not black holes , have lifetimes much greater than a hubble time and emit highly red shifted quiescent thermal spectra that may be quite difficult to observe .",
    "there are additional power law components of similar magnitude that originate as magnetic dipole spin - down radiation ( see below ) .    escaping radiation passes through a pair plasma atmosphere that can be shown , _",

    "an agn with @xmath132 would have a somewhat warmer photosphere at @xmath133 k , but with a red shift of 360000 .",
    "from the viewpoint of a distant observer , accretion would deliver mass - energy to the meco , which would then radiate most of it away . the contribution from the central meco alone",

    "thus the high accretion state luminosity of a gbhc would originate primarily from the central meco .",
    "the thermal component would be ` ultrasoft ' with a temperature of only @xmath148 ( 1.1 kev ) .",
    "a substantial fraction of the softer thermal luminosity would be compton scattered to higher energy in the plunging flow inside @xmath136 .",
    "even if a disk flow could be maintained all the way to the meco surface , where a hot equatorial band might result , the escaping radiation would be spread over the larger area of the photosphere due to photons origins deep inside the photon orbit .    for radiation passing through",
    "the photosphere most photons would depart with some azimuthal momentum on spiral trajectories that would eventually take them across and through the accretion disk .",
    "thus a very large fraction of the soft photons would be subject to bulk comptonization in the plunging region inside @xmath136 .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the situation for neutron stars where there probably is no comparable plunging region and few photons from the surface cross the disk .",
    "this could account for the fact that hard x - ray spectral tails are comparatively much stronger for high state gbhc .",
    "our preliminary calculations for photon trajectories randomly directed upon leaving the photon sphere indicate that this process would produce a power law component with photon index greater than 2 .",
    "these are difficult , but important calculations for which the effects of multiple scattering must be considered .",
    "but they are beyond the scope of this paper , which is intended as a first description of the general meco model .",
    "the progression of configurations of accretion disk , magnetic field and boundary layer is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the caption summarizes the spectral features expected in four regimes :    * quiescence * + a low accretion rate is ablated by @xmath149 erg / s radiation from the central object at a large inner disk radius .",
    "this luminosity is sufficient to raise the temperature of the optically thick inner disk above the @xmath150 k instability temperature for hydrogen out to a distance of @xmath151 cm .",
    "therefore we expect the quiescent inner disk to be essentially empty with a large inner radius .",
    "the rate of mass flow ablated at the inner disk radius would only need to be @xmath152 g / s to produce the quiescent optical emission observed for gbhc and ns .",
    "the ablated material could escape if it reached the magnetic propeller region , which is confined to the light cylinder at a much smaller radius , @xmath153 , than that of the inner disk .",
    "this makes the meco model compatible with the disk instability model of x - ray nova outbursts , which begin as ` outside - in ' events in which substantial outer mass reservoirs have been observed to fill an accretion disk on the viscous timescale of a very subsonic radial flow ( orosz et al .",

    "it has recently been shown ( muno et al . 2002 ) that the distinction between ` atoll ' and ` z ' sources is merely that this point is reached near the eddington limit for ` zs ' and at perhaps @xmath178% of this luminosity ( barrett & olive 2002 ) for the less strongly magnetized ` atolls ' .",

    "more likely , the plasma stream is broken up by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities and filters through the magnetosphere . in any event ,",

    "* quasi - periodic oscillations * + although many mechanisms have been proposed for the high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) of x - ray luminosity , they often require conditions that are incompatible with thin , viscous keplerian disks .",
    "several models have requirements for lumpy flows , elliptical inner disk boundaries , orbits out of the disk plane or conditions that should produce little radiated power . in a conventional thin disk , the vertical oscillation frequency , which is approximately the same as the keplerian frequency of the inner viscous disk radius should generate ample power .",
    "accreting plasma should periodically wind the poloidal meco magnetic field into toroidal configurations until the field lines break and reconnect across the disk .",
    "field reconnection across the disk should produce high frequency oscillations that couple to the vertical oscillations .",
    "if so , there would be an automatic association of high frequency qpo with the harder power - law spectra of magnetospherically driven emissions , as is observed .",
    "mass ejection in low state jets might be related to the heating of plasma via the field breakage mechanism , in addition to natural buoyancy of a plasma magnetic torus in a poloidal external field .",
    "it seems possible that toroidal winding and reconnection of field lines at the magnetopause , might continue in high states inside @xmath136 .",
    "if so , there might be qpo that could be identified as signatures of the meco magnetosphere .",
    "if they occur deep within the magnetosphere , they might be at locally very high frequencies , and be observed distantly as very redshifted low frequencies . as shown in appendix a , the ` keplerian ' frequencies in the plunging region inside @xmath136 are given by @xmath195 hz .",

    "even if qpo are not produced inside @xmath136 or inside the photon sphere for gbhc , there is an interesting scaling mismatch that might allow them to occur for agn .",
    "although the magnetic moments of agn scale inversely with mass , the velocity of plasma inside @xmath136 does not .",
    "thus the energy density of disk plasma inside @xmath136 will be relatively larger than magnetic field energy densities for agn accretion disks .",
    "when field energy density is larger than kinetic energy density of matter , the field pushes matter around . when the reverse is true , the matter drags the field along . thus toroidal winding of the field at the magnetopause could fail to occur for gbhc , but might easily do so for agn .",
    "if the process is related to mass ejection , then very energetic jets with lorentz factors @xmath200 might arise from within @xmath136 for agn . a field line breakage model of ` smoke ring ' like mass",
    "ejection from deep within @xmath136 has been developed by chou & tajima ( 1999 ) . in their calculations ,",
    "a pressure of unspecified origin was needed to stop the flow outside @xmath201 and a poloidal magnetic field , also of unspecified origin was required .",
    "meco provide the necessary ingredients in the form of the intrinsic meco magnetic field .",
    "the chou & tajima mechanism , aided by intense radiation pressure , may be active inside @xmath136 for gbhc and produce extremely large episodic mass ejections such as those shown by grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "although not developed for conditions with large inner disk radius , the same magnetic mechanism could produce the jet emissions associated with the low / hard state ( gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) .",
    "finally , some of the rich oscillatory behavior of grs 1915 + 105 may be readily explained by the interaction of the inner disk and the central meco .",
    "the objects in table 1 have co - rotation radii of order @xmath202 , which brings the low state inner disk radius in close to the central object . a low state meco , balanced near co",
    "- rotation would need only a small increase of mass flow rate to permit mass to flow on to the central meco .",
    "this would produce more than 20x additional luminosity and enough radiation pressure to blow the inner disk back beyond @xmath154 and load its mass onto the magnetic field lines where it is ejected .",
    "this also explains the association of jet outflows with the oscillatory states .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that after ejection of the inner disk , it then refills on a viscous time scale until the process repeats .",
    "thus one of the most enigmatic gbhc might be understood as a relaxation oscillator , for which the frequency is set by a critical mass accretion rate .",
    "it may be possible to detect meco in several ways .",
    "firstly , as we have shown , for a red shift of @xmath24 , the quiescent luminosity of a gbhc meco would be @xmath203 erg / s with @xmath204 kev .",
    "this thermal peak might be observable for nearby or high galactic latitude gbhc , such as a0620 - 00 or xte j1118 + 480 .",
    "secondly , at moderate luminosities @xmath205 erg / s but in a high state at least slightly above @xmath206 , a central meco would be a bright , small central object that might be sharply eclipsed in deep dipping sources .",
    "a high state meco should stand out as a small bright source .",
    "this is consistent with analyses of absorption dips in gro j1655 - 40 ( church 2001 ) which have shown the soft source of the high state to be smaller than the region that produces the hard spectral component of its low states .",
    "a conclusive demonstration that most of the soft x - ray luminosity of a high state gbhc is distributed over a large accretion disk would be inconsistent with meco or any other gbhc model entailing a central bright source . if the meco model is correct , the usual identification of the bright , high state soft component as disk emissions would be wrong .",
    "thirdly , a pair plasma atmosphere in an equipartition magnetic field should be virtually transparent to photon polarizations perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the x - rays from the central meco should exhibit some polarization that might be detectable , though this is far from certain since the distantly observed emissions could originate from nearly any point on the photosphere .",
    "meco presumably would not be found only in binary systems .",
    "if they are the offspring of massive star supernovae , then they should be found all over the galaxy . if we have correctly estimated their quiescent temperatures , isolated meco would be weak ,",
    "possibly polarized , euv sources with a power - law tail in soft x - rays .",
    "it is now becoming apparent that many of the spectral properties of lmxb , including the gbhc , are consistent with the existence of intrinsically magnetized central objects .",
    "we have shown that the existence of intrisically magnetic gbhc are consistent with a new class of magnetospheric eternally collapsing object ( meco ) solutions of the einstein field equations of general relativity .",
    "these solutions are based on a strict adherence to the strong principle of equivalence ( spoe ) requirement for timelike world line completeness ; i.e. , that the world lines of physical matter under the influence of gravitational and non - gravitational forces must remain timelike in all regions of spacetime . since there is nothing in the structure of the einstein tensor , @xmath207 , on the left hand side of the einstein field equation that dynamically enforces",
    "` time like world line completeness ' , we have argued that the spoe constrains the physically acceptable choices of the energy momentum tensor , @xmath48 to contain non - gravitational forces that can dynamically enforce it . in this context",
    "we have found the meco solutions .",
    "since meco lifetimes are orders of magnitude greater than a hubble time , they provide an elegant and unified framework for understanding the broad range of observations associated with gbhc and active galactic nuclei .",
    "an enormous body of physics scholarship developed primarily over the last half century has been built on the assumption that trapped surfaces leading to event horizons and curvature singularities exist .",
    "misner , thorne & wheeler ( 1973 ) , for example in sec .",
    "34.6 clearly state that this is an assumption and that it underlies the well - known singularity theorems of hawking and penrose .",
    "in contrast , we have found that strict adherence to the spoe demand for timelike world line completeness requires a _ ` no trapped surface condition'_. this has led to the quasi - stable , high red shift meco solutions of the einstein field equations .",
    "the physical mechanism of their stable rate collapse is an eddington balance maintained by the distributed photon generation of an equipartition magnetic field .",
    "this field also serves to confine the pair plasma dominated outer layers of the meco and the thin meco pair atmosphere .",
    "red shifts of @xmath24 have been found to be necessary for compatibility with our previously found magnetic moments for gbhc .",
    "we have delineated the expected spectral properties of meco in quiescence and in accreting states and shown that the central magnetic moments are large enough to require their accretion disks to be dominated by gas pressure , though the inner disk may be subject to substantial irradiation .",
    "the meco model seems able to robustly account for the general spectral and timing behaviours of gbhc while providing for their appropriate quantitative differences from ns .",
    "lastly , we have indicated some ways in which meco might be detected and confirmed .",
