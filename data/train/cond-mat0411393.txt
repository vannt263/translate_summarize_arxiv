    "<S> we report the first results of time - dependent density functional simulations of magnetic properties of fe and ni at finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> they reveal the existence of local moments in ni above the curie temperature , coupled to strong short range order . in fe the short range order is also present to a lesser extent but spin wave like excitations persist in both materials well above the curie temperature in the paramagnetic state . the prevailing view of magnetic order should be reconsidered in light of these findings .    </S>",
    "<S> a proper description of the microscopic behavior of magnetic systems at finite temperature represents one of a few fundamental problems still existing in the theory of magnetism . while numerous model theories with different adjustable parameters lead to some description of magnets at finite temperatures , the attendant approximations significantly influence the final results . </S>",
    "<S> _ ab initio _ methods have been used since the early 1980 s ; however they are limited to zero temperature and largely reproduce the heisenberg model . </S>",
    "<S> as might be expected , such methods provide a good description of magnets with localized moments , but the results for itinerant magnets are rather unsatisfactory . in particular , the temperature dependence of longitudinal fluctuations and magnetic short - range order ( msro ) have always been neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> msro in itinerant magnets is the subject of a long - standing controversy . </S>",
    "<S> early reports on inelastic neutron scattering experiments indicated the persistence of spin wave - like modes with relatively small wave vectors above the curie temperature @xmath0 in both ni and fe@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on these results , the local band theory was developed@xcite , but its assumptions are incompatible with the observed curie - weiss susceptibility and specific heat anomaly@xcite . since then , various experimentssro confirm the presence of some degree of msro in many ferromagnets , and the present belief is that it can be very strong . </S>",
    "<S> however , up to now theory has failed to estimate the degree of msro in different magnets , owing to the formidable challenges in implementing a tractable theory for real materials .    </S>",
    "<S> several quantitative theoretical methods based on the use of the calculated band structure have been developed . in many cases the _ ab initio _ version of the single - site coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) </S>",
    "<S> was employed . </S>",
    "<S> the first calculation@xcite evaluates the msro in fe by calculating the non - local exchange coupling . </S>",
    "<S> however , the single - site cpa presupposes that msro is absent ; hence the calculated msro is small . </S>",
    "<S> further cpa calculations@xcite also obtained a good description of finite - temperature properties of bcc fe , but do not find any local magnetic moment ( lmm ) at high temperatures in fcc ni . using onsager s reaction - field approach@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the description of ni can be improved , which indicates that some interatomic correlations beyond the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) should be included , at least for ni .    </S>",
    "<S> different tight - binding methods not based on the cpa have been used to estimate the msro and the effective coupling in fe and ni @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most did not find strong msro and failed to explain the corresponding experimental data . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was claimed that the effective coupling is much stronger at the curie temperature than at @xmath1 , which makes the temperature - dependence of the exchange coupling a very important problem . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we will discuss below , the tight - binding approximation leads to a strong underestimation of msro , and hence to different physics . </S>",
    "<S> the first band - structure calculations of the effective exchange coupling@xcite may be regarded as being in the limit which is opposite to the cpa , since the local band theory assumes strong msro . however , these calculations@xcite yielded a much smaller degree of msro in contradiction with the initial assumption . </S>",
    "<S> this contradiction has yet to be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it seems that no numerical calculations so far have explicitly shown the presence of strong msro in fe or ni based on their band structures , while the experiments clearly indicate its presence .    </S>",
    "<S> the second key point concerns the proper inclusion of longitudinal fluctuations in itinerant magnets at finite - temperature , which are missing in any rpa theory .    if it were not for serious challenges limiting its tractability , _ ab initio _ spin dynamics would be a very powerful tool to address all these issues . in ref.@xcite a combination of first principles spin dynamics with different stochastic or deterministic types of finite - temperature description was proposed . in the present paper we present an implementation that makes this technique practicable , and apply it for the first time to studies of finite - temperature behavior of ferromagnetic fe and ni . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is based on time - dependent spin density functional theory tddft . </S>",
    "<S> the main equation in this theory is @xmath2where @xmath3 is a non magnetic part of the total potential , @xmath4 is the magnetic part of the exchange correlation potential and @xmath5 is the external magnetic field .    instead of considering the evolution of the non - local density matrix </S>",
    "<S> , one can introduce the closed system of coupled equations for the three local one electron quantities : the charge density @xmath6 , the magnetization density @xmath7 , and the velocity density @xmath8 . separating the magnetization dynamics adiabatically </S>",
    "<S> , one can obtain the main one - electron equation of spin dynamics @xmath9   \\label{kss}\\]]where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the velocity field for the electron liquid .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic assumption of the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) is that the exchange - correlation potential of the homogeneous electron gas with fixed charge density @xmath13 and magnetization density @xmath14 can be applied to real external potentials . in this approximation @xmath15 @xmath16 , and hence assumes very strong exchange correlation field @xmath17 compared to the ` kinetic ' field @xmath18 and the smallness of dynamics associated with the exchange correlation term . </S>",
    "<S> this important approximation assumes that correlation effects do not contribute to the spin dynamics of magnets , but attributes all of the dynamics to the kinetic term . </S>",
    "<S> many static calculations of spin excitations have generally confirmed that this approximation is valid for many materials . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> saga we estimated the strength of correlation effects by calculating the contribution of non - local coulomb correlations to the spin wave stiffness in the gw approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution happened to be very small compared to the kinetic contribution . </S>",
    "<S> below we will confirm that this approximation is quite reasonable for dynamic simulations as well .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we solve eq.([kss ] ) by using the classical langevin approach for finite temperatures , and employ the so - called orbital dynamics approach@xcite so that each orbital can precess with its own frequency , independent of the other orbitals . in this treatment we avoid the standard adiabaticity which is assumed in the dynamic rigid spin approximation , and account for all decoherence effects properly within lsda . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is similar to the linear response technique when the external field is small . </S>",
    "<S> however , our approach does not necessarily assume that the _ perturbation _ is small .    </S>",
    "<S> all calculations were performed within lsda using the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital method . </S>",
    "<S> in typical calculations with 100 - 120 atoms per cell we used 20 - 30 @xmath19-points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> the correct description of possible long - range magnetic order ( especially at low temperatures ) requires that the simulation cell contains many atoms . </S>",
    "<S> to avoid this numerical difficulty , we added temperature - dependent spin - spiral boundary conditions @xcite that is dynamical , with its corresponding equation of motion . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the static case , such combined real / reciprocal space spin dynamics allowed us to significantly reduce the number of atoms per cell in our simulations and made numerous statistical calculations possible . from the physical point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the simultaneous inclusion of real - space short - range modes ( inside the supercell ) and long - wavelength modes ( between supercells ) enables the description of magnetic excitations developing at different length scales , as well as their interactions , on an equal footing . as we now show , the ability to include multiple - length scales was essential to this work .    </S>",
    "<S> first , let us discuss static properties . in fig.1 </S>",
    "<S> we show the total magnetization of fe as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the results for 128-atom simulations ( using dynamical spin spiral boundary conditions ) for fe are shown together with the finite - size scaling result . </S>",
    "<S> the finite - size scaling results were obtained using supercells of four different sizes for both ni and fe . </S>",
    "<S> the effectiveness of the dynamical spiral boundary conditions can be seen in the 128-atom simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the low magnetization tail above @xmath0 was reproduced in standard real space calculations ( monte carlo simulations for the heisenberg model ) only when 7000 - 8000 atoms were used@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 resulting from the simulation is quite satisfactory . for fe , </S>",
    "<S> nearly perfect agreement with experiment is obtained : 1070k ( 1023k ) ; in ni @xmath0 is about 25% smaller then experiment : 470 k ( 623k ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this discrepancy may be attributed to the lsda itself : the total energy difference between fully ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic ni is about 550k ( with all parameters identical to the dynamical simulation ) . while this upper limit to the @xmath0 in ni is somewhat higher when gradient corrections are added to lsda , we do not at present have a sufficiently accurate density functional to disentangle the lsda contribution to the error . </S>",
    "<S> we only suggest that this error is connected with some on - site coulomb correlations which are missing in lsda at @xmath1 k. the proper acccount of quantum corrections could significantly affect @xmath0 as well .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective paramagnetic moment @xmath21 the was extracted from the calculations of high - temperature susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> these moments compared to experimental values@xcite are 3.3 ( 3.13 ) and 1.75 ( 1.6 ) bohr magnetons for fe and ni respectively .    to interpret these large moments </S>",
    "<S> we will now discuss the dynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> a very unusual picture of magnetic order near @xmath0 emerges . the crucial physical quantity which reveals a degree of short- or long - range order in magnets is the spin - spin correlation function@xmath22where @xmath23 indicates thermodynamic average . </S>",
    "<S> the short - range part of @xmath24 is strongly affected by the presence of itineracy in the magnetic system . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of @xmath24 shows that the average angle between nearest neighbors lmm is 67@xmath25 in bcc fe near @xmath0 , however in fcc ni it is just 28@xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers are very stable as a function of temperature : within a temperature range of 0.95@xmath0 to 1.05@xmath0 their overal changes do not exceed 3 - 4% . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation from 90@xmath25 indicates that in fe the msro is relatively small ( but noticeable ) , while in ni it is enormous . </S>",
    "<S> a real - space analysis of the correlation function shows that in ni the dynamic ordering is of the spin - spiral or domain - wall type , with a period of @xmath2614 a.u . on the other hand , in fe </S>",
    "<S> nearest neighbor correlations dominate and a relatively weak superparamagnetic type msro is realized at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the dynamic correlation function has very well defined peaks well above @xmath0 and clearly demonstrates the persistence of the spin - wave - like perturbations in the paramagnetic state of fe and ni . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively high energy of short - wave ferromagnons in these materials is primarily responsible for this feature .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such msro at @xmath0 indicates that the nearest neighbor interactions in these materials must be larger then @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the exchange couplings in these materials are well known ( see ref.wang,prb1 ) and corresponding numbers are somewhat lower then @xmath0 making the existence of the strong msro  in these materials impossible . on the other hand , starting from pioneering calculations in ref.@xcite all calculations of @xmath27 assumed a long wave approximation ( lwa ) which has smallness parameter @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the stoner parameter@xcite . in general , this approximation is inapplicable to systems with strong interatomic interactions ( as in the case of itinerant magnets ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the usage of the more general definition @xmath30 leads to a much better interpretation of our results . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the lwa is suitable for a relatively ` localized ' system such as fe , and the corresponding change in the nearest neighbor exchange is relatively small ( @xmath2615% ) but still somewhat higher than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> ni represents a rather itinerant system , and any local approach ( especially lwa ) is expected to produce a large error . in our case , @xmath31 for ni is increased by more than 3 times relative to the lwa , clearly that the effective coupling is much larger than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these results explain why the msro was missed in previous calculations of @xmath27 and indicate that the traditional mf approach ( or any other approach which is based on the assumption of no short - range order ) is inapplicable to itinerant systems in general , predicting very high @xmath0 ( above 1000 k in ni ) . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation has a qualitative character due to known violation of adiabaticity criteria in the itinerant magnets .    </S>",
    "<S> the msro allows us to provide a different interpretation of the susceptibility results as described above . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the effective magnetic moment @xmath21 in the curie - weiss law compared to the localized model is directly related to clustering ( for example , of the superparamagnetic type ) when the effective moment of the cluster is several times larger then original atomic moment . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the effective moment to the atomic moment is larger in ni than in fe . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations also indicate that in ni a significant contribution ( 15% ) comes from longitudinal fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> . the high temperature paramagnetic state of ni has both tangential and longitudinal modes as soft modes which are much closer to each other than at @xmath1 k. we performed several model calculations for ni assuming static disorder with 90@xmath25 average angle between nearest lmm ( no msro ) . </S>",
    "<S> for all eight random configurations studied the value of @xmath21 was much lower ( about 50 - 60% of our theoretical value ) , clearly supporting msro contribution to the @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , all final self consistent states in ni for these random configurations appeared to be non magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> so , we believe that strong msro is a necessary requirement for fcc ni to be ferromagnetic and a similar conclusion should apply to all itinerant magnets .    </S>",
    "<S> such strong msro can not appear only at finite temperatures ; it must exist already at @xmath1 k ( as indicated by our calculations of the effective coupling ) . </S>",
    "<S> to study msro in more detail we performed the following model calculations at t=0 k. first , we studied the degree of localization by rotating the lmm at one site by an arbitrary angle ( similar to ref.@xcite but with lwa removed ) . in case of the fully localized heisenberg type of interaction </S>",
    "<S> one can expect that such perturbation is perfectly stable and the total energy is described by @xmath32 type of behavior . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation revealed completely different picture ( fig.2 ) . in case of single site perturbation , </S>",
    "<S> the atomic magnetic moment in fe disappears at approximately 120@xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> longitudinal fluctuations at this point become so important that the moment is inverted . </S>",
    "<S> as we mentioned above , such effects can not be described in any tight - binding type of approach . in ni </S>",
    "<S> the situation is even more complicated and at @xmath2650@xmath25 the local moment is completely destroyed . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations immediately suggest that both fe and ni do not have a well defined lmm at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we also found , that the lmm with opposite spin configuration in bcc fe can be stabilized if the perturbation is extended to the first shell of neighboring atoms , providing a clear range of minimal msro to support such strong local perturbation . in the itinerant ni the complete flip of lmm </S>",
    "<S> can not be stabilized even if the perturbation is extended to the first neigboring atoms ( fig.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation is stabilized only when it is extended to three shells of neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations strongly support the idea of giant msro in fcc ni and relatively small ( but essential ) msro in bcc fe .    </S>",
    "<S> another indication of itineracy ( and strong msro ) only was obtained from studies of non - magnetic configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the range of existence of lmm in non magnetic fcc ni . in case </S>",
    "<S> when lmm  exist only at one atom such fluctuation is unstable and lmm simply does not exist . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the lmm is fixed at its equilibrium value ( 0.6 @xmath33 ) on nearest atoms , the atomic lmm is stable . according to our lsda calculations fcc ni at its experimental density has stable lmm of @xmath260.6 @xmath33 only if it has ferromagnetic interaction with two nearest shells of atoms with the same moments . </S>",
    "<S> this result clearly indicates that magnetism in ni has itinerant character . </S>",
    "<S> its nature in this material is not so much in intra - atomic interactions but rather in interatomic ferromagnetic interactions with nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> this also indicates that the standard adiabatic criterion is not applicable in ni at finite temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> such strong msro also allow us to resolve a very old issue of the importance of quantum corrections for @xmath0 and high - temperature susceptibility calculations . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections are traditionally small in the localized systems ( @xmath34 magnets ) , but always considered to be significant in the itinerant systems . </S>",
    "<S> msro described above also strongly suppresses quantum corrections in the case of the itinerant magnets by increasing the effective moment .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we performed _ </S>",
    "<S> ab - initio _ spin dynamic simulations at finite temperatures using time - dependent spin density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations revealed the existence of magnetic short range order at @xmath0 in @xmath35 ferromagnetic magnets fe and ni . </S>",
    "<S> this short - range order is relatively small in bcc fe ( the average angle between local magnetic moments @xmath36 ) , while in fcc ni it is rather large ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of distorted spin waves above @xmath0 significantly reduces the range of applicability of the traditional models of magnetism which are based on the idea of the spin wave disappearing at @xmath0 , and demonstrates that more reliable models of magnetism are needed . </S>",
    "<S> this msro strongly affects all observable properties and establishes that the thermodynamics of fe and ni can be described in the framework of the density functional approach . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that msro is a natural property of any magnet over a very wide temperature range and is the _ sine qua non _ in low moment ( @xmath38 ) itinerant magnets where msro dramatically influence thermodynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> this msro is unique in each system and has a certain memory about the ground state of that system . from the methodical point of view </S>",
    "<S> the successful usage of our approach clearly indicates that the kinetic energy produces the largest contribution to the dynamics of magnets at finite temperature while the exchange - correlation contribution is small .    </S>",
