    "when hadronic systems are described in terms of quarks and gluons , it is part of nature that the characteristic momenta are of the same order or even very much larger than the masses of the particles involved .",
    "for example , relativistic effects are crucial to describe the low - lying hadrons made of @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks and anti - quarks@xcite .",
    "it has also been realized that a parametrization of nuclear reactions in terms of non - relativistic wave functions must fail .",
    "thus , a relativistic treatment is one of the essential ingredients that should be incorporated in developing a successful strong interaction theory .    for the relativistic hamiltonian approach ,",
    "several forms of dynamics have been suggested@xcite .",
    "although the point form dynamics has also been explored recently@xcite , the most popular choices were thus far the equal-@xmath2 ( instant form ) and equal-@xmath3 ( light - front form ) quantizations . a crucial difference between the instant form and the light - front form may be attributed to their energy - momentum dispersion relations .",
    "when a particle has the mass @xmath4 and the four - momentum @xmath5 , the relativistic energy - momentum dispersion relation of the particle at equal-@xmath2 is given by @xmath6 where the energy @xmath7 is conjugate to @xmath2 and the three - momentum vector @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 .",
    "however , the corresponding energy - momentum dispersion relation at equal-@xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where the light - front energy conjugate to @xmath10 is given by @xmath12 and the light - front momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 are orthogonal to @xmath15 and form the light - front three - momentum @xmath16 . while the instant form ( eq.([droft ] ) ) exhibits an irrational energy - momentum relation , the light - front form ( eq.([droftau ] ) )",
    "yields a rational relation and thus the signs of @xmath17 and @xmath15 are correlated , _",
    "e.g. _ the momentum @xmath17 is always positive when the system evolve to the future direction ( _ i.e. _ positive @xmath10 ) ) so that the light - front energy @xmath15 is positive . in the instant form ,",
    "however , no sign correlations for @xmath7 and @xmath8 exist .",
    "such a dramatic difference in the energy - momentum dispersion relation makes the light - front quantization quite distinct from other forms of the hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the light - front quantization @xcite has already been applied successfully in the context of current algebra @xcite and the parton model @xcite in the past . with the recent advances in the hamiltonian renormalization program@xcite",
    ", light - front dynamics ( lfd ) appears to be even more promising for the relativistic treatment of hadrons . in the work of brodsky , hiller and mccartor @xcite ,",
    "it is demonstrated how to solve the problem of renormalizing light - front hamiltonian theories while maintaining lorentz symmetry and other symmetries .",
    "the genesis of the work presented in @xcite may be found in @xcite and additional examples including the use of lfd methods to solve the bound - state problems in field theory can be found in the recent review@xcite .",
    "these results are indicative of the great potential of lfd for a fundamental description of non - perturbative effects in strong interactions",
    ". this approach may also provide a bridge between the two fundamentally different pictures of hadronic matter , i.e. the constituent quark model ( cqm ) ( or the quark parton model ) closely related to experimental observations and the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) based on a covariant non - abelian quantum field theory .",
    "again , the key to possible connection between the two pictures is the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation given by eq.([droftau ] ) that leads to a relatively simple vacuum structure .",
    "there is no spontaneous creation of massive fermions in the lf quantized vacuum .",
    "thus , one can immediately obtain a constituent - type picture  , in which all partons in a hadronic state are connected directly to the hadron instead of being simply disconnected excitations ( or vacuum fluctuations ) in a complicated medium .",
    "a possible realization of chiral symmetry breaking in the lf vacuum has also been discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one of the most popular formulations for the analysis of exclusive processes involving hadrons exists in the framework of light - front ( lf ) quantization  @xcite . in particular , the drell - yan - west ( @xmath18 ) frame has been extensively used in the calculation of various electroweak form factors and decay processes  @xcite . in this frame@xcite",
    ", one can derive a first - principle formulation for the exclusive amplitudes by choosing judiciously the component of the light - front current .",
    "as an example , only the parton - number - conserving ( valence ) fock state contribution is needed in @xmath19 frame when the  good \" component of the current , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , is used for the spacelike electromagnetic form factor calculation of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "one does nt need to suffer from complicated vacuum fluctuations in the equal-@xmath10 formulation once again due to the rational dispersion relation .",
    "the zero - mode contribution may also be avoided in drell - yan - west frame by using the plus component of current @xcite .",
    "however , caution is needed in applying the established drell - yan - west formalism to other frames because the current components do mix under the transformation of the reference - frame@xcite .    in lfd",
    "a fock - space expansion of bound states is made .",
    "the wave function @xmath22 describes the component with @xmath23 constituents , with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath24 , perpendicular momentum @xmath25 and helicity @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "it is the aim of lfd to determine those wave functions and use them in conjunction with hard scattering amplitudes to describe the properties of hadrons and their response to electroweak probes .",
    "important steps were taken towards a realization of this goal@xcite . however ,",
    "at present there are no realistic results available for wave functions of hadrons based on qcd alone . in order to calculate the response of hadrons to external probes",
    ", one might resort to the use of model wave functions .",
    "this way to estimate matrix elements has been presented in many literatures @xcite .",
    "especially , the variational principle enabled the solution of a qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian , and the constructed lf quark - model provided a good description of the available experimental data spanning various meson properties @xcite . the same reasons that make lfd so attractive to solve bound - state problems in field theory make it also useful for a relativistic description of nuclear systems .",
    "lf methods have the advantage that they are formally similar to time - ordered many - body theories , yet provide relativistically invariant observables .",
    "on the other hand , the poincar algebra in the ordinary equal-@xmath2 quantization is drastically changed in the light - front equal-@xmath10 quantization . although the maximum number ( seven ) of the ten poincare generators are kinematic ( i.e. interaction independent ) and they leave the state at @xmath28 unchanged  @xcite , rotation becomes a dynamical problem in the light - front quantization . because the quantization surface @xmath10 = 0 is not invariant under the transverse rotation whose direction is perpendicular to the direction of the quantization axis @xmath29 at equal @xmath10@xcite , the transverse angular momentum operator involves the interaction that changes the particle number .",
    "leutwyler and stern showed that the angular momentum operators can be redefined to satisfy the su(2 ) spin algebra and the commutation relation between mass operator and spin operators  @xcite ; @xmath30 = i { \\epsilon_{ijk } } { \\cal{j}}_k,\\ ] ] @xmath31 = 0.\\ ] ] however , in lfd , there are two dynamic equations to solve : @xmath32 and @xmath33 where the total angular momentum(or spin ) and the mass eigenvalues of the hadron(@xmath34 ) are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "thus , it is not a trivial matter to specify the total angular momentum of a specific hadron state .    as a step towards understanding the conversion of the dynamical problem from boost to rotation , in this work we construct the poincar algebra interpolating between instant and light - front time quantizations .",
    "we use an orthogonal coordinate system which interpolates smoothly between the equal - time and the light - front quantization hypersurface .",
    "thus , our interpolating coordinate system has a nice feature of tracing the fate of the poincare algebra at equal time as the hypersurface approaches to the light - front limit .",
    "the same method of interpolating hypersurfaces has been used by hornbostel . in an arbitrary interpolation angle",
    ", we find the transformation that allows not only the simultaneous assignments of mass and angular momentum but also su(2 ) algebra among the angular momentum operators .",
    "approaching the light - front limit , we verify that the lfd has one more kinematic operator than the dynamics with any other interpolation angle . also , we find that the roles of angular momentum and boost are smoothly exchanged as the interpolation angle moves from @xmath2 to @xmath10 .",
    "we also obtain a general definition of @xmath37 and @xmath38 at an arbitrary interpolation angle and show that it is consistent with the result obtained by leutwyler and stern in the light - front limit .    in the next section , section",
    "ii , we present the poincar algebra interpolating between equal-@xmath2 and equal-@xmath10 . in section iii , we construct the angular momenta that satisfy the su(2 ) spin algebra in any interpolation angle and present the two dynamic equations to be solved simultaneously in an arbitrary interpolation angle .",
    "discussion of results and conclusions follow in section iv . in appendix",
    "a , we summarize the forty - five commutation relations for the poincar generators with an arbitrary interpolation angle . in appendix b",
    ", we provide explicit representations of the helicity operator and the spin 1 and spin 1/2 polarization vectors with an arbitrary interpolation angle .",
    "we begin by introducing an interpolating parameter @xmath39 .",
    "previous authors have used the parameter @xmath40 such that @xmath41 here @xmath42 plays the role of `` time '' and @xmath43 is the longitudinal coordinate as defined on an arbitrary interpolation front . in this work",
    "we define @xmath44 so that @xmath45 this parameter is easily visualized and ranges from @xmath46 on the equal - time instant @xmath47 to @xmath48 on the light - front @xmath49 . in this new basis",
    "the metric becomes @xmath50 =   \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc } c & 0 & 0 & s \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ s & 0 & 0 & -c \\end{array } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , we transform the poincar matrix to this new basis , so that @xmath54 = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc } 0 & k^1 & k^2 & k^3 \\\\ -k^1 & 0 & j^3 & -j^2 \\\\ -k^2 & -j^3 & 0 & j^1 \\\\ -k^3 & j^2 & -j^1 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ) \\rightarrow [ m^{\\mu\\nu } ] = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc } 0 & e^1 & e^2 & -k^3 \\\\ -e^1 & 0 & j^3 & -f^1 \\\\ -e^2 & -j^3 & 0 & -f^2 \\\\ k^3 & f^1 & f^2 & 0 \\end{array } \\right),\\ ] ] where we introduce the operators @xmath55 on an arbitrary interpolation front",
    ".    the ten generators of the poincar algebra are @xmath56 , where each poincar generator is defined on the interpolation front as follows .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath57 , where @xmath58 similarly the momentum vector is @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the transverse rotation operators can be read from @xmath61 $ ] to be @xmath62 and @xmath63 . as in both the equal - time and light - front cases ,",
    "transverse rotations are chosen to commute with the hamiltonian , @xmath64 = 0 $ ] .",
    "finally , the transverse boost operators for an arbitrary interpolation front are @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "again as in both the equal - time and light - front cases , transverse boosts are chosen to commute with the longitudinal momentum , @xmath67 = 0 $ ] .",
    "note that the longitudinal angular momentum and longitudinal boost operators are essentially unaffected by the transformation to an arbitrary interpolation front .",
    "other commutation relations among the ten generators may be obtained from the usual rules @xmath68 = -i(g^{\\mu\\rho}-g^{\\mu\\sigma}p^{\\rho})$ ] and @xmath69 = -i(g^{\\beta\\sigma}m^{\\alpha\\rho}-g^{\\beta\\rho}m^{\\alpha\\sigma}+ g^{\\alpha\\rho}m^{\\beta\\sigma}-g^{\\alpha\\sigma}m^{\\beta\\rho})$ ] .",
    "a comprehensive list of the 45 commutation relations among the contravariant components of the poincar generators is presented in the appendix .",
    "this algebra is consistent with the equal - time algebra for @xmath46 ; it is also consistent with the light - front algebra for @xmath48 .",
    "next we investigate the algebraic structure of the poincar group on an arbitrary interpolation front .",
    "the stability group of the initial surface @xmath70 is the set of operators which generate poincar transformations that leave this surface invariant . following the literature ,",
    "we describe such operators as kinematical . in physical terms ,",
    "kinematical operators are those operators that do not change the direction of the time ( @xmath42 ) axis . to clarify the distinction between kinematic and dynamic operators , we define an alternate set of poincar genarators by transforming the poincar matrix : @xmath71 , so that : @xmath72 = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc } 0 & { \\cal d}_1 & { \\cal d}_2 & k^3 \\\\   -{\\cal d}_1 & 0 & j^3 & -{\\cal k}_1 \\\\ -{\\cal d}_2 & -j^3 & 0 & -{\\cal k}_2 \\\\",

    "thus the @xmath77 eigenvalue for a given momentum state is invariant under @xmath75 .",
    "it follows that the + component of any four - vector is invariant under @xmath75 , and therefore @xmath78 . as the instant @xmath79 is unaltered , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are kinematic .",
    "the sets of kinematic and dynamic generators are presented in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "there are two key features to be noted in this algebra .",
    "the first is the appearance of the longitudinal boost operator in the stability group on the light - front .",
    "the number of kinematic generators remains unchanged until we reach the light - front quantization , where the operator @xmath82 becomes kinematic . to understand this , note that @xmath83 = ip_{- } =   i(sp^+ - cp^- ) \\rightarrow ip^+$ ] as @xmath84 .",
    "similarly we have @xmath85 = ix_{- } =   i(sx^+ - cx^- ) \\rightarrow ix^+$ ] as @xmath84 .",
    "therefore the instant defined by @xmath70 becomes invariant under longitudinal boosts as we move to the light - front . besides this new feature , the operators in each group change continuously as we move from the equal - time quantization to the light - front .",
    "the second feature to note is the smooth exchange of the roles of transverse boosts and rotations . in the equal time case ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "rotations are kinematic and boosts are dynamic . on the light front , however , transverse rotations are dynamic and transverse boosts are kinematic . in the interpolating case , the kinematic generators @xmath80 and @xmath81 are mixtures of boosts ( @xmath86 ) and rotations ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the dynamic generators @xmath88 and @xmath89 are also mixtures of boosts and rotations .",
    "the mixing coefficients are smooth functions of interpolating angle , as displayed in figure 1 .",
    "we now construct the form for an arbitrary kinematic transformation on a fixed interpolation front .",
    "in general we have @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are free parameters . under what conditions",

    "within this subspace , eq.([lf - j ] ) coincides with eq.([lf - angula ] ) .",
    "it follows that our interpolating spin operators are consistent with the light - front spin operators within the subspace on which they are defined .",
    "now let us consider the equal - time limit . in the equal - time limit",
    "the kinematic subspace contains only the rest state , and @xmath94 becomes a rotation . since any sequence of rotations leaves the rest state invariant , the parameters @xmath158 may take on any value ( see footnote 3 ) .",
    "the spin operators become @xmath181 where @xmath182 .",
    "if we set @xmath183 , then @xmath184 these are rotated about the x - axis .",
    "similarly if we set @xmath185 , then @xmath186 these are rotated about the y - axis .",
    "thus the spin operators are angular momentum operators @xmath187 , about rotated axes , as we should expect .",
    "when we restrict @xmath94 to be the identity transformation , each @xmath188 , and we recover the ordinary equal - time angular momentum operators .",
    "in this work , we constructed the poincare algebra valid for any interpolation angle between the instant limit and the light - front limit .",
    "we find that the light - front limit @xmath48 is a special angle that adds a new kinematic operator @xmath169 .",
    "the conversion of the dynamical operator between boost and rotation is quite smooth as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the general result of @xmath136 in the instant limit agrees with the ordinary angular momentum @xmath189 while it agrees with the lf @xmath136 obtained by leutwyler and stern in the light - front limit with operation to the parabolic subspace shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the subspace is limited to only the rest frame in the instant limit while it can expand to an arbitrary frame in the light - front limit .",
    "we have also presented the helicity operator in an arbitrary interpolation angle .",
    "explicit verification for the correct helicity eigenvalues is summarized in the appendix b. since our results are model independent , they can play the role of testing any suggested hadron model .",
    "our results indicate that the interpolation method preserving the orthogonal coordinate system is useful in tracing the fate of interesting results obtained by one form of hamiltonian dynamics in the other end of interpolation angle .",
