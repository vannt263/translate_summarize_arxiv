    "leptogenesis @xcite is an extremely successful theory in explaining the baryon asymmetry of the universe by adding three heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath2 to the standard model , @xmath3 with masses @xmath4 at the scale of grand unified theories ( guts ) and yukawa couplings @xmath5 similar to the other fermions .",
    "this also solves the problem of the light neutrino masses via the see - saw mechanism without fine - tuning @xcite .    the heavy neutrinos decay into lepton and higgs boson after inflation , the decay is out of equilibrium since there are no gauge couplings to the standard model .",
    "if the cp asymmetry in the yukawa couplings is large enough , a lepton asymmetry is created by the decays which is then partially converted into a baryon asymmetry by sphaleron processes . as temperatures are high , interaction rates and the cp asymmetry need to be calculated using thermal field theory @xcite rather than vacuum quantum field theory .",
    "however , in the conventional approach @xcite , thermal masses have been put in by hand without investigating the validity of this approach in detail .",
    "we have adressed this issue in @xcite and found that corrections arise through the occurence of two lepton dispersion relations in the thermal bath . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the decay rate of the heavy neutrino in a consistent way ( chapter  [ decay ] ) which automatically includes the effect of leptonic quasiparticles , compare it to the conventional approach ( chapter [ leptogenesis ] ) and give an outlook of what needs to be done to arrive at consistent descriptions of leptogenesis .",
    "our calculation is general enough to be applied to all decays of a yukawa fermion at finite temperature , which has interesting implications for other early universe dynamics ( chapter [ conclusions ] ) .",
    "if a particle reaction like scattering or decay takes place in the background of a heat bath , e.g.  in the hot state of the early universe , thermal field theory has to be employed to describe this process .",
    "there are two different approaches for considering finite temperatures within quantum field theory , the imaginary and real time formalism @xcite , both yielding the same results . in this work",
    ", we will use the imaginary time formalism .",
    "going from zero to finite temperature , ensemble - weighted expectation values of operators have to be used rather than vacuum expectation values .",
    "for an operator @xmath6 , this reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density operator describing the ensemble . in this way",
    "it can be shown that the propagator at finite temperature @xmath9 is given by its usual vacuum expression where the zero component of the momentum is replaced by imaginary discrete matsubara frequencies @xmath10 in the case of bosons or @xmath11 in the case of fermions with integers @xmath12 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "perturbation theory at finite temperature then follows from using these propagators and summing over the matsubara frequencies in loop diagrams .",
    "however , using these bare thermal propagators can lead to inconsistent results , which are not complete to leading order , infrared divergent , and gauge dependent in the case of gauge theories .",
    "a famous example is the damping rate of a plasma wave in the quark gluon plasma , which is different in different gauges . in order to cure this ,",
    "the hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummation has been invented @xcite .",
    "for this purpose one has to distinguish between hard momenta of the order @xmath9 or larger and soft momenta of the order @xmath13 or smaller , where @xmath14 is the coupling constant , which is strictly possible only in the weak coupling limit @xmath15 .",
    "after all , the htl improved perturbation theory has been successfully applied to thermal qcd for the description of the quark - gluon plasma ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea is that the bare propagators are replaced by resummed propagators , if the external momentum is soft @xmath16 .    for a scalar field ( fig .",
    "[ resummed ] ) , this resummation follows from the dyson - schwinger equation as    resummed propagator ]    @xmath17    the thermal self - energy @xmath18 of the scalar field then acts as a thermal mass @xmath19 and gives a correction to the zero - temperature mass @xmath20 . since @xmath18 is of the order @xmath21 , the resummation will only affect the propagator when @xmath22 , which is reflected in the prescription to resum only soft momenta .",
    "the resummed fermion propagator has a more complicated structure and will be explained in the next section . in general , the self - energy is momentum dependent , e.g.  the photon self - energy in qed . in this case , the leading order gauge independent self - energy follows from integrating only over hard momenta in the loop diagram defining the self - energy .",
    "this htl contribution in the resummed propagator leads to a correction of the order @xmath13 which can not be neglected if the momentum of the propagator is soft .",
    "the poles of the htl resummed propagators then describe the dispersion relations in the medium , e.g. plasma waves following from the resummed photon propagator .",
    "in addition to propagators also htl effective vertices related to the propagators by ward identities might have to be used .",
    "in the neutrino decay we want to calculate , the higgs boson and the lepton acquire thermal masses of the order @xmath23 via their interactions with other standard model particles . in the regime where the temperature is of the order of the neutrino mass @xmath24 , one of the momenta of the decay products can be soft and",
    "has to be resummed . in the regime",
    "where @xmath25 , both higgs boson and lepton momentum will be soft and need to be resummed .",
    "we are interested in both regimes , therefore we will resum both higgs boson and lepton propagator .",
    "the case of resumming only one propagator is included in this approach , since resumming a hard propagator gives only a negligible correction to the bare propagator .",
    "the htl resummation has been invented for the weak coupling limit @xmath15 .",
    "this limit does not apply in our case , our more phenomenological approach is rather motivated by the desire to capture effects beyond perturbation theory and justified a posteriori by the sizeable corrections it reveals , similar to the treatment of meson correlation functions in @xcite .",
    "we consider a leptogenesis - inspired model with a massive majorana fermion _",
    "n _ coupling to a massless dirac fermion @xmath26 and a massless scalar @xmath27 .",
    "the interaction and mass part of the lagrangian then reads @xmath28 the htl resummation technique has been considered in @xcite for the case of a dirac fermion with yukawa coupling , from which the htl resummed propagators for the lagrangian in eq .",

    "since the quasi - particles are our final states , we will set @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .",

    "as pointed out in more detail in @xcite , we have shown that the approach to treat thermal masses like zero temperature masses in the final state @xcite is justified since it equals the htl treatment with an approximate fermion propagator .",
    "however this approach does not equal the full htl result .    concluding this calculation , a caveat has to be added : the external majorana fermion will also acquire a thermal mass of order @xmath13 .",
    "thus , if its zero temperature mass is smaller than that , the external fermion also needs to be described by leptonic quasiparticles to be consistent .",
    "however , in our leptogenesis application , the yukawa coupling giving rise to the majorana neutrino decay is much smaller than the couplings giving rise to the thermal masses of the higgs boson ( scalar ) and the lepton ( dirac fermion ) and thus the thermal mass of the heavy neutrino can be neglected .",
    "we have calculated the decay rate assuming a majorana particle , but the result can be very easily generalized to the case of two dirac fermions by inserting the appropriate factors of two in the decay rate and the thermal masses .",
    "when turning to leptogenesis with @xmath109 we sum over the two components of the doublets , particles and antiparticles and the three lepton flavors .",

    "the other yukawa couplings can be neglected since they are much smaller than unity and the remaining couplings are renormalized at the first matsubara mode @xmath123 as explained in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ comp ] , we compare our consistent htl calculation to the approximation adopted by @xcite , while we add quantum statistical distribution functions to their calculation which then equals the approach of using an approximated lepton propagator @xmath124 as in eq .   @xcite .",

    "considering two modes , the kinematics exhibit a more interesting behavior .",
    "for the positive mode , the phase space is reduced due to the larger quasi - mass and at @xmath136 , the decay is only possible into leptons with small momenta , thus the rate drops dramatically .",
    "the decay into the negative , quasi - massless mode is suppressed since its residue is much smaller than the one of the positive mode . however , the decay is possible up to @xmath137 . due to the various effects , the two mode rate differs from the one mode approach by more than one order of magnitude in the interesting temperature regime of @xmath138 .",
    "it is extremely tempting to put this result in a boltzmann - solver and obtain an effect for the produced baryon asymmetry .",
    "however , in the quest for consistent treatments which capture effects of the same origin and size , other effects need to be included as well . at higher temperatures , when @xmath139 , the higgs can decay into neutrino and lepton modes and this process acts as production mechanism for neutrinos @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cp asymmetry needs to be calculated taking into account the two lepton modes in order to have a consistent treatment .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , we have , by employing htl resummation and finite temperature cutting rules , confirmed that treating thermal masses as kinematic masses as in @xcite is a reasonable approximation .",
    "however , quantum statistical functions need to be included as they always appear in thermal field theory .",
    "moreover , the full htl lepton propagator shows a non - trivial two - mode behavior which is not accounted for by the conventional approach .",
    "we have calculated the effect of the two modes in a general way which is applicable to any decay and inverse decay rates involving fermions at high temperature .",
    "thus , this calculation is a valuable tool for other particle processes in the early universe , as other leptogenesis processes , the thermal production of gravitinos or the like .",
    "the behavior of the decay density of the two lepton modes can be explained by considering the dispersion relations @xmath58 of the modes and assigning momentum - dependent quasi - masses to them .",
    "the thresholds for neutrino decay reported in @xcite are shifted and the decay density shows deviations of more than an order of magnitude in the interesting temperature regime @xmath140 .",
    "thus we expect these effects to have a sizeable impact on the final baryon asymmetry",
    ". however , in order to arrive at a minimal consistent treatment , also the decay @xmath141 at high temperatures needs to be included as well as a cp asymmetry that is corrected for lepton modes . in a further step , it will be interesting to include the effect of thermal widths in the calculations .",
    "as for all effects arising from thermal field theory , the effects are only important in the weak washout regime , where leptogenesis takes place at high temperatures .",
    "we are aware of the progress that is currently being made in approaching the effects of quantum statistics @xcite , quantum transport equations @xcite or other collective phenomena as e.g.  the landau - pomeranchuk effect @xcite .",
    "these efforts contribute to getting an idea of the size and impact of various thermal effects by approaching the extremely complex situation from different angles .",
