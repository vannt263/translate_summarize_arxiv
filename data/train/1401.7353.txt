    "realization of the quantum regime  @xcite of physical systems has been of great interest .",
    "one important signature of the quantum regime is the squeezing which has been studied rather extensively for radiation fields  @xcite , collection of two level atoms and spins  @xcite , optical phonons  @xcite , and bose condensates  @xcite .",
    "the squeezing is of fundamental importance in precision measurements  @xcite and thus quantum metrology drives the demand not only for higher levels of squeezing but also for the availability of squeezing in a variety of systems .",
    "there are several studies demonstrating squeezing in optomechanical systems  @xcite . in the present work on optomechanical systems ,",
    "we develop an analog of the standard method for producing squeezing in quantum optics . we will also give a comparison of our proposal with other squeezing schemes .    in quantum optics ,",
    "the downconverter is an important resource for producing squeezing  @xcite , thus it is desirable to have an optomechanical system which can behave effectively like a downconverter . in a downconverter , three light field modes defined by annihilation operators @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 get coupled in a nonlinear medium where the second order nonlinearity is nonzero .",
    "this coupling is described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 which , under the condition of a strong undepleted pump field @xmath1 , reduces to @xmath5 .",
    "the photon pairs @xmath2 and @xmath3 are spontaneously produced from the pump .",
    "these are the entangled pairs .",
    "an appropriate linear combinations @xmath6 of the modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 can produce quadrature squeezing . note that the susceptibility @xmath7 for the downconverter has no resonances in the frequency range of interest .",
    "any system whose effective interaction can be reduced to the form @xmath5 becomes a good candidate for squeezing .",
    "the third order nonlinearities in optical fibers can also give rise to such an interaction leading to a large number of studies on squeezing  @xcite .",
    "in the cavity optomechanics , one can realize several parametric processes : a blue detuned pump with frequency @xmath8 can in fact produce spontaneously a cavity photon of frequency @xmath9 and a phonon of frequency @xmath10 . in the undepleted pump approximation , this process would be described by an effective hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath2 stands for the cavity photon and @xmath3 stands for the phonon . though this hamiltonian has the form of a downconverter , it can not produce squeezing of the light field since @xmath10 is many orders less than @xmath9",
    ". then one would like to replace the phonon mode by another optical mode .",
    "the cavity optomechanics has another parametric process where a red detuned pump and a probe , defined by annihilation operator @xmath11 , can produce a coherent phonon . in the undepleted pump approximation",
    ", this is described by @xmath12 .",
    "this interaction also implies that a phonon in combination with a red detuned pump will produce a cavity photon @xmath11 .",
    "thus a cavity photon can be produced using either the blue detuned pump or by using a red detuned pump and a phonon . in what follows ,",
    "we use both these mechanisms to produce a pair of photons in a double cavity optomechanical system .",
    "thus we produce a photon pair by using phonons in a manner as discussed by several authors  @xcite .",
    "it should be kept in mind that although we produce a photon pair , the mediating mechanism is an active mechanism which puts a limit on the amount of achievable squeezing .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation with a downconverter where the crystal participates in a passive manner in the sense that it does not contribute to quantum noise .",
    "we show generation of very large squeezing even at temperatures like @xmath0mk .",
    "the large squeezing is a consequence of active phonon nonlinearities which become large due to the resonant nature of the underlying processes .",

    "ii we present the basic model , underlying equations and the different parametric processes in the two cavities . in sec .",
    "iii we present the calculation of the squeezing spectra for the field which is a linear superposition of the two output fields . in sec .",
    "iv we present numerical results for squeezing .",
    "we explain the origin of squeezing via the phonon mediated four - wave mixing ( fwm ) process .",
    "we also compare our squeezing scheme to those obtained using other methods . in sec .",
    "v we investigate the effect of the brownian noise of the mirror and its effect on the output state purity . in sec .",
    "vi we present our conclusions .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we consider a double cavity optomechanical system model , in which a mechanical resonator coated with perfect reflecting films on both sides are coupled to two identical optical cavities .",
    "one possible realization is using `` membrane - in - the - middle '' setup  @xcite , except that we assume the membrane is fully reflective on both sides .",

    "<S> we propose a scheme generating robust squeezed light by using double cavity optomechanical system driven by a blue detuned laser in one cavity and by a red detuned laser in the other . this double cavity system is shown to mimic effectively an interaction that is similar to the one for the downconverter , which is known to be a source of strong squeezing for the light fields . </S>",
    "<S> there are however distinctions as the phonons , which lead to such an interaction , can contribute to the quantum noise . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the squeezing of the output fields in the order of @xmath0db can be achieved even at the mirror temperature at the order of @xmath0mk . </S>"
