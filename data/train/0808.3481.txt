    "hydrodynamic turbulence remains a basically unsolved problem of modern physics .",
    "this is especially noticeable as the fundamentals seem to be fairly easy  the navier - stokes - equations for the velocity and pressure fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 with the additional constraint @xmath3 express the conservation of momentum in a classical , newtonian , incompressible fluid of viscosity @xmath4 and density @xmath5 .",
    "laminar flows are reproduced very accurately ; in the turbulent regime , it still is an open question how the universal characteristics of a flow , the scaling exponents @xmath6 of the structure functions @xmath7 of order @xmath1 , defined by @xmath8 can be extracted from the basic equations .",
    "intermittency is reflected by exponents @xmath6 that differ from those expected by dimensional analysis .",
    "+ monte - carlo - simulations enable us to analyze turbulent flow patterns in detail , to gain direct insight into the formation of localized structures and their behaviour , and to measure observables like the scaling exponents .",
    "+ instead of working with the full navier - stokes - eqs . , we decided to elaborate the methods using burgers eq . @xmath9 which can be interpreted as the flow equation for a fully compressible fluid . a finite viscosity @xmath4 and energy dissipation @xmath10",
    "provide a dissipation length scale @xmath11 corresponding to the kolmogorov - scale in navier - stokes - turbulence : @xmath12 besides being of interest of its own ( e.g. in cosmology ) , working with eq .",
    "( [ dh : eqburg ] ) has a number of technical advantages :    * burgers eq .",
    "is local , while the incompressibility condition acts as a nonlocal interaction in navier - stokes - turbulence . * the fundamental solutions to burgers eq .",
    "are well - known ; in the limit of vanishing viscosity ( hopf - eq . ) , these form singular shocks as seen in fig .",
    "( [ dh : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the dissipation - scale provides an uv - regularization of the shock structures .",
    "+   as a function of @xmath13 in periodic boundary conditions at constant @xmath14.,width=216 ] * a huge variety of analytical methods have been applied to burgers eq . , giving results that can directly be compared to numerical measurements ; and the origin of intermittency is well understood .",
    "for the moment , we restrict our work to 1-dimensional burgulence which already shows intermittent statistics . a random force",
    "@xmath15 has to be introduced into eq .",
    "( [ dh : eqburg ] ) so that solutions are statistically homogenous in time : @xmath16\\doteq \\partial_{t}v + v \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}v - \\nu   \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2 } v = f,\\ ] ] where we model the stochastic force to be gaussian distributed with zero mean , energy injection rate @xmath10 and correlation length @xmath17 : @xmath18 we then expect intermittent statistics to be found within the inertial subrange @xmath19 .",
    "we can further identify a characteristic velocity at the injection scale , @xmath20 , and a reynolds - number @xmath21 the path integral is introduced via the standard martin - siggia - rose - formalism , giving for the generating functional @xmath22 & = & \\int \\mathcal{d}v \\ , \\mathcal{d}f \\ , \\delta(\\mathbf{b}[v ] - f )",

    "we discretized the above action onto a rectangular lattice with @xmath24 sites in space- , and @xmath25 sites in time - direction .",
    "derivatives have been written in a symmetric ( stratanovich- ) prescription .",
    "lattice spacings will be denoted @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "we mainly used a heat bath algorithm on single nodes .      to indentify the lattice parameters with the constants of the continuum theory , we first notice that the viscosity has to be defined as @xmath28 in which we define the arbitrary constant @xmath29",
    "the so - defined @xmath4 gives us @xmath30 according to eq .",
    "( [ dh : egre ] ) .",
    "we further find that the dissipation length @xmath11 is related to the correlation length @xmath17 simply by @xmath31 in any practical application , it is sufficient to define the @xmath32 and @xmath30 , to chose @xmath24 and @xmath17 , and to calculate from that @xmath25 and @xmath10 . stability considerations lead to further constraints for the lattice size , as will be explained in the following subsection .",
    "as would be expected , the stability of the simulations over a large number of monte - carlo - steps is a big issue , due to the shock - like solutions of eq .",
    "( [ dh : eqburg ] ) . indeed , if certain restrictions to the lattice parameters are not taken care of rigorously , the simulation terminates sooner or later due to divergencies . + it is interesting to notice that the occurence of instabilities in our mc - simulations is related to the ( non - trivial ) existence of the dissipation scale @xmath11 .",
    "we found that to obtain stable simulations , @xmath11 has to be resolved on the lattice : @xmath33 .",
    "unstable simultations occur otherwise  we observed that the overall energy of the configurations accumulate in the smallest scale @xmath26 , causing the configuration to separate into two sub - configurations , of which one looks as the expected solution to the hopf - eq . , while the other grows beyond any limit , eventually breaking the simulation . +",
    "as long as the dissipation length is resolved , the simulations are stable . having performed several millions of mc - steps , no further instabilities occured .",
    "if length scales are measured in units of the system size , this translates into a constraint involving the reynolds - number : @xmath34 which enforces huge lattices for high @xmath30 as @xmath35 .",
    "we simulated systems of different sizes , from @xmath36 to larger lattices of the same viscosity , as @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and also different viscosities , like @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "the reynolds - number ranged from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , not respecting the above conditions for stability .",
    "this may seem surprising , but we could see that interesting information could also be extracted from the physical sub - configurations .",
    "stable runs have been obtained for @xmath43 .",
    "+ long runs of several millions of mc - steps , on a single node , are realistic for small lattices like @xmath44 or @xmath37 only . for larger lattices , a parallelized version of the code will be needed .",
    "+ we obtained the following results :    * thermalization and autocorrelation times are very long , up to the order of @xmath45 mc - steps . * in the stable runs , after thermalization , the typical shock solutions of the burgers eq . form and can be observed moving and interacting with each other , see fig .",
    "( [ dh : fig2 ] ) . +   of a @xmath46-lattice ; the plot shows a slize of constant @xmath14 , periodic boundary conditions in @xmath13 .",
    "two shock - like structures are clearly visible-,width=216 ] * in the unstable runs before occurence of the instability , configurations resemble the kink - solutions of the hopf - eq .. * the disctinction between stable and unstable simulations can directly be related to the existence of a dissipation length scale which is either bigger ( stable ) or smaller ( unstable simulations ) than the lattice spacing .",
    "we have shown how to perform stable mc - simulations of stochastic partial differential eq . , like burgers or the hopf - eq .. the lattice versions of the theories can directly be identified with their continuum counterparts , and , as long as certain constraints on the lattice size are respected , unlimited numbers of configurations produced . direct insight into the structures leading to intermittency and ,",
    "thus , multiscaling , can be obtained .",
    "especially , we want to point out that the existence of a dissipation length scale can be observed . + as next steps , complete statistics will be made ; especially the scaling exponents of the structure functions have to be compared with the analytic results .",
    "later , we will proceed by analyzing the incompressible navier - stokes - eqs ..",
