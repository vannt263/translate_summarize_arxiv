    "brown dwarfs with effective temperatures of 18003000  k have spectra closely resembling those of red dwarf stars at similar temperatures , and the two types of objects share the same classification scheme , either as m - types in roughly the upper two - thirds of this range or as early l - types in the lower one - third .",
    "the later l - types ( with t@xmath9 below about 1800  k ) are solely the domain of brown dwarfs , but the visible and short wavelength ir spectra of these objects are a steady continuation of the trends seen in the spectra of early l - types , with alkali metal lines , metal hydride bands , and water vapor bands strengthening with decreasing temperature . as the surface of a brown dwarf cools below approximately 13001500  k , however , an important chemical change occurs as methane ( ch@xmath10 ) attains a large abundance at the expense of carbon monoxide ( co ) .",
    "the many strong infrared absorption bands of ch@xmath10 and the disappearance of condensates ( which significantly affect the spectra of l - types ) below the photosphere substantially alter the spectral appearance of the brown dwarf , the former making it totally unlike any stellar object .",

    "the mismatches are probably due to variations in guiding accuracy and in seeing during the observations , as well as probable inaccuracies in the ir magnitudes of the calibration star used in the reduction .",

    "the only atomic feature observed in the spectrum of gl  570d is the potassium doublet near 1.25  @xmath1 m , which is considerably weaker than the doublet in gl  229b and is only just discernable .",
    "the strong absorption bands of ch@xmath10 and h@xmath20o define the overall shapes of the two spectra , which are quite similar .",
    "however , the bands are deeper and in some cases broader in gl  570d than gl  229b . the increasing blueness at @xmath2 with decreasing temperature is thus seen to be a consequence of the relative degrees of strengthening of the ( already very strong ) absorption bands of water and methane .",
    "it also is due in part to the increased opacities of the broad ( and blended ) h@xmath20 pressure - induced 1 - 0 s(1 ) , s(0 ) and q(1 ) absorptions at 2.12  @xmath1 m , 2.22  @xmath1 m , and 2.41  @xmath1 m ( e.g. , borysow , j@xmath21rgensen , & zheng 1996 ) .",

    "briefly , the atmospheres are in radiative / convective equilibrium and the molecular opacities are treated with the k - coefficient method ( goody et al .",

    "the present models also include the line opacities of na , k , and cs as described in burrows , marley , & sharp ( 2000 ) .",
    "it appears that condensates do not play a significant role in shaping the spectrum of the cooler t dwarfs ( burrows et al .",
    "2000 ; however , see tsuji , ohnaka , & aoki 1999 ) .",
    "the opacities of condensation clouds are not included in the present models , although the chemical equilibrium calculation takes into account the formation of condensates .",
    "particulates are assumed to fall below the spectroscopically accessible region of the atmosphere .",
    "the equation of radiative transfer is solved including scattering , following toon ( 1989 ) .",
    "compared to the t dwarf gl  229b , gl  570d offers the advantage that the primary star of the system is fairly well studied .",
    "the metallicity of gl  570a was determined by hearnshaw ( 1976 ) and feltzing & gustafsson ( 1998 ) to be [ fe / h]=0.01 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "we adopt the solar abundances of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) for modeling gl  570d .    using the same monochromatic opacities used to compute the k - coefficients ,",
    "high - resolution synthetic spectra were generated from the atmospheric structures by solving the radiative transfer equation with the feautrier method ( mihalas 1978 ) on a frequency grid with @xmath28@xmath29 .",
    "the synthetic spectra were convolved with a gaussian filter to match the resolution of the observations .      because the present spectrum samples more than half of the flux emitted by gl  570d , and because the distance is known to be 5.91@xmath120.06  pc ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) , we can tightly constrain the possible solutions for the surface parameters of gl  570d by using both synthetic spectra and evolution calculations .",
    "we use a method similar to the one applied to gl  229b by saumon et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . the solar - metallicity evolution sequence for cooling brown dwarfs of burrows et al .",

    "the integral of the observed flux over wavelength , @xmath38w / m@xmath39 , allows us to estimate @xmath30 .",
    "we obtain the bolometric correction factor from our synthetic spectra by taking the ratio of the flux integrated over the observed wavelength range to the total emergent flux ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this synthetic correction is a function of the spectrum parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and is found to vary between 1.6 and 1.9 in the parameter range of interest here . by applying the bolometric correction to the empirically - determined flux , we obtain another relation for the bolometric luminosity , @xmath41 . the intersection of the two @xmath30 surfaces gives a curve @xmath42 which represents the allowed parameters for gl 570d . for a given gravity , this curve and the cooling sequence give @xmath31 , @xmath30 , the mass , the radius , and the age of the brown dwarf .",
    "the results are given in table 3 for three representative gravities .",
    "there are three sources of uncertainty in our determination of @xmath43 .",
    "the distance to gl  570d is known to a precision of @xmath44% and the absolute calibration of our spectrum has an uncertainty of @xmath45% .",
    "finally , the synthetic bolometric correction depends on the reliability of our synthetic spectra . as discussed below ( section 4.2 ) , there are systematic differences between the synthetic and observed spectra of t dwarfs .",
    "fortunately , these tend to cancel out when calculating integrated fluxes for the bolometric correction .",
    "for example , varying the abundance of the main absorber , h@xmath22o , by 0.1 dex affects the bolometric correction by only 2% .",
    "a consistency check can be made with the l@xmath14 measurement , which we did not include in the computation of the bolometric correction .",
    "the synthetic @xmath46 magnitude is 14.32 , or 0.2 mag fainter than the observed value .",
    "however , only 7.6% of the total flux of gl  570d is in the l@xmath14 band so the resulting error in the bolometric correction is @xmath47% .",
    "other modifications of the synthetic spectrum calculations all indicate that the bolometric correction is correct to within @xmath48% .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath43 and @xmath31 are thus @xmath49% ( @xmath50 dex ) and @xmath51k , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows the models listed in table 3 superimposed on brown dwarf cooling curves . the nearly vertical band running through the center is a constant luminosity curve with the luminosity of model",
    "b ( @xmath52 ) . since all three models a , b , and c have nearly the same luminosity ( see table 3 ) , models a and c also fall within that band .",
    "we find that for a given , assumed gravity , gl  570d is about 160@xmath4k cooler than gl  229b .",
    "so far , we have greatly reduced the allowed space for the physical parameters of gl  570d ( fig .",
    "however , while @xmath31 is between 700 and 870@xmath4k , and the well - determined luminosity can range from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , the gravity remains largely unconstrained , and , with it , the mass and age of gl  570d .",
    "we can reduce the possible range of gravities by determining the age of the system .",
    "fortunately , the primary star , gl  570a , is a well - observed k4 v star to which we can apply several age indicators .",
    "the gl  570 system contains a spectroscopic binary , gl 570bc .",
    "based on the projected separation of the a ",
    "bc system ( @xmath55au ) , the mass of the primary ( @xmath56 ) , and the mass of the bc pair ( @xmath57 ) , the orbital period of the a ",
    "bc system is of the order of 1400 years ( forveille et al .",
    "1999 ) . by comparison ,",
    "the rotation period of gl  570a is only 40 days ( cumming , marcy , & butler 1999 ) .",
    "we can safely assume that there has been no spin - up of the primary star due to tidal interaction with the bc pair and that we can use stellar activity indicators as if gl  570a were an isolated star .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of gl  570a is @xmath58 ( schmitt & kahabka 1995 ) or @xmath59 times lower than hyads of the same spectral type ( stern , schmitt , & kahabka 1995 ) , clearly indicating that gl  570a is older than the hyades cluster .",
    "gl  570a has old disk kinematics ( leggett 1992 ) , and thus is older than @xmath60gyr ( eggen 1989 ) .",
    "the bc pair has a combined spectral type of m1 v , with individual masses of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ( forveille et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the lack of h@xmath63 emission from the bc pair indicates that it is older than @xmath64gyr ( soderblom , duncan , & johnson 1991 ; hawley , gizis , & reid 1996 ) .",
    "thus these indicators suggest a lower bound of @xmath64gyr for the age of the gl 570 system .    on the other hand ,",
    "gl  570a is chromospherically active with a ca ii h and k emission index of @xmath65 ( henry et al .",
    "this is 0.15 less than hyads of the same spectral type , indicating that gl  570a is older than the hyades , in complete agreement with our lower bound for the age . for comparison ,",
    "the sun varies from @xmath66 to @xmath67 during the solar cycle and is considered inactive . using the age - emission index relation of donahue ( 1993 ; given in henry",
    "et al . 1996 ) , we obtain an age of 0.8@xmath4gyr for gl  570a . however , if we assume that gl  570a was observed during a maximum phase of activity and that its emission index varies with the same amplitude as the sun s , then the emission index of gl  570a might be as low as @xmath68 , with a corresponding age of 3.1@xmath4gyr .",
    "figure 10 of soderblom et al .",
    "( 1991 ) shows the data used to derive a similar age - emission index relation . if we consider the stars showing the most extreme scatter toward older ages for a given value of @xmath69 , _ including the error bars on the age determinations _ , we find that to be older than the sun , gl  570a would have to have an emission index of less than -4.95 , which is extremely unlikely .",
    "we conclude that the chromospheric activity of gl  570a indicates relative youth and a very conservative upper bound of 5@xmath4gyr for its age .",
    "figure 2 shows isochrones for our adopted age range for the gl  570 system .",
    "the allowed range of gravities for gl  570d is now considerably reduced to 5.00  @xmath70  @xmath71  5.27 .",
    "these extremes correspond to @xmath72 ( 824 ) , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , and @xmath75 ( 52 ) , respectively .",
    "our values for the physical parameters of gl  570d agree very well with the estimates of burgasser et al .",
    "the midpoints of these ranges are @xmath76 , @xmath77k , and @xmath78 .",
    "the last is less than half the luminosity of gl  229b .",
    "a meaningful comparison of the masses of gl  570d and gl  229b is not possible since the mass of the latter is poorly constrained .",
    "we derived the physical parameters simply from the observed integrated flux , the distance to gl  570d , synthetic bolometric corrections , and cooling tracks for brown dwarfs .",
    "as for gl  229b ( saumon et al .",
    "2000 ) , it was not necessary to fit the observed spectrum with models to derive @xmath31 and the gravity . while the synthetic spectra of t dwarfs are fairly successful at reproducing the observations , there are known problems which affect a few spectral regions ( see below ) .",
    "fitting the spectrum over a wide range of wavelengths remains an imprecise exercise and our method is far more reliable . by relying only on wavelength - integrated fluxes ,",
    "most of the errors in the synthetic spectrum cancel one another .",
    "our procedure also uses cooling calculations for the @xmath79 relation , which is rather insensitive to the details of the atmospheric surface boundary condition .",
    "further improvements in the modeling of brown dwarf atmospheres , principally by the inclusion of condensation clouds , will have a very modest effect on this relation .",
    "we have computed synthetic spectra for the models in table  3 .",
    "the flux received at earth is simply obtained from the radius of each model and the distance to gl  570d .",
    "the resulting spectra are compared to our 0.832.52@xmath37 m spectrum in fig .  3 .",
    "we emphasize that no fitting of the spectra has been performed , although spectrum b is a generally better fit to the observations than either a or c. the overall agreement of the model with the data is remarkable .",
    "this demonstrates both the power and the internal consistency of our method of analysis and that the overall spectral energy distribution is well - modeled .",
    "nevertheless , all three models show particular deviations from the observed spectrum , most of which are also seen in models for gl  229b ( allard et al .",
    "1996 ; marley et al . 1996 ; saumon et al .",
    "2000 ) .    as discussed by saumon et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the ch@xmath23 opacity line list becomes increasingly incomplete at temperatures above 300@xmath4k .",
    "since gl  570d is about 160@xmath4k cooler than gl  229b , we expect to obtain a better agreement with the observed spectrum in the ch@xmath23 bands . indeed , the 2.3@xmath37 m ch@xmath23 band , which is formed at a level where @xmath80k , matches the data extremely well .",
    "the 1.6@xmath37 m band is formed at @xmath81k , and its overall strength also matches well .",
    "the edge of the band appears at longer wavelengths in the model and the features in the 1.631.72@xmath37 m region have a much larger amplitude than in the data , however .",
    "this also occurs in models of gl  229b and shows the limitation of the ch@xmath23 opacity data base .",
    "the h@xmath22o bands in the model are too strong , notably in the 1.11.2@xmath37 m , 1.31.6@xmath37 m , and 1.82.1@xmath37 m regions .",
    "this problem also has plagued cloudless models of gl  229b and can not be resolved by simply invoking a lower abundance of h@xmath22o .",
    "its persistence suggests that condensates are present in the atmosphere ( tsuji et al .",
    "1999 ; ackerman & marley , 2001 ) and that they have a small but detectable effect on the spectrum .",
    "the heavily pressure - broadened k i resonance doublet at 0.77@xmath37 m is mostly responsible for the very weak flux at 0.81.0@xmath37 m ( tsuji et al .",
    "1999 ; burrows et al . 2000 ) . in this model ,",
    "the opacity of the doublet is significant up to 1.1@xmath37 m , yet the flux is overestimated on the blue side of the 1.08  @xmath1 m peak .",
    "most of this mismatch is due to an underabundance of neutral k in the cooler part of the atmosphere .",
    "the potassium abundance at levels where @xmath82k depends on the overall treatment of condensates and can be modeled in two ways .",
    "one is to consider that condensates form and remain in local equilibrium with the gas .",
    "this means that existing high temperature ( primary ) condensates can react with the gas at lower temperatures and secondary condensates form via gas - solid reactions in the upper , cooler part of the atmosphere .",
    "this is the case described as `` no rainout '' by burrows & sharp ( 1999 ) and burrows et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and is the one used in the present analysis .",
    "however , this scenario for condensate formation may be relevant only for low - gravity environments such as the solar nebula and stellar outflows and thus may be unlikely for brown dwarf atmospheres .    a second approach to condensate formation",
    ", more applicable for low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , is the `` condensation cloud formation '' model , also described as `` rainout '' by burrows & sharp ( 1999 ) and burrows et al .",
    "primary condensates form directly from the gas and are sequestered in a condensate cloud of finite vertical extent because of the gravity field .",
    "this prevents the formation of secondary condensates by gas - solid reactions at lower temperatures ( above the cloud ) that deplete the abundance of gaseous potassium in the former case of `` no rainout . ''",
    "the condensation cloud formation model predicts a higher abundance of gaseous potassium in the upper part of the atmospheres of t dwarfs ( compare figs . 2 and 3 of burrows et al .",
    "2000 ) . in fig .",
    "4 , we compare the spectrum computed with the k i abundance from our calculation without `` rainout '' ( solid curve , burrows & sharp 1999 ) and with the condensation cloud formation model ( dotted curve , lodders 1999 ) .",
    "the latter agrees much better with the observed spectrum in the region dominated by the k i resonance doublet .",
    "this further strengthens the case for the formation of condensate clouds in the atmospheres of t dwarfs as argued by fegley & lodders ( 1996 ) and lodders ( 1999 ) .",
    "the k i doublet at 1.2432 and 1.2522@xmath37 m is weak but detected in our spectrum , while the model predicts very strong lines .",
    "decreasing @xmath31 , increasing @xmath32 , and decreasing the potassium abundance could all reduce the strength of the lines in the model .",
    "the magnitude of the changes required in these parameters is unreasonable in view of the other constraints , however .",
    "the two lines of the doublet share the same lower level of k i ( about 1.6@xmath4ev above the ground state ) and are quite sensitive to temperature . in gl",
    "570d , this doublet is formed at the level where @xmath83k .",
    "the strength of the doublet decreases rapidly at lower temperatures .",
    "the larger than observed strength of the computed k  i doublet may be due to remaining uncertainties in the @xmath84 profile in the atmosphere model ( perhaps due to the effects of condensates deep in the atmosphere ) .",

    ".    a better fit to the spectrum of gl  570d could be obtained with a more detailed study .",
    "while the deviations we find could be due to residual uncertainties in the @xmath84 profile of the atmosphere or the presence of a warm dust layer , compositional variations from a solar mixture of heavy elements may play a role .",
    "feltzing & gustafsson ( 1998 ) found that the abundances of individual elements in gl  570a are scattered around the solar values by @xmath85  dex .",
    "in particular , they find [ o / h]=0.16 , [ na / h]=0.06 , and [ ca / h]@xmath86 with uncertainties of @xmath87 dex",
    ". if the abundances of several other key elements ( c , n , o , k , si , and mg , for example ) also deviate appreciably from their solar values , and if we assume that gl  570d shares the same atmospheric composition as the primary star , the modeled spectrum would be altered .",
    "such refinements go beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "new and improved spectra and photometry of gl  570d , one of the coolest and least luminous brown dwarfs known , have been analyzed by spectral modeling to yield more accurate estimates of luminosity , effective temperature , and surface gravity .",
    "the observations demonstrate that the increasing blueness at @xmath2 of t dwarfs with decreasing temperature continues down to objects with effective temperatures of at least 800  k. comparison of model spectra with the observed spectra provides some evidence for rainout of condensates and suggests that the k  i doublet at 1.25  @xmath1 m may be a sensitive indicator of the temperature profile in t dwarfs .",
