    "understanding nonleptonic @xmath15 meson decays is crucial for testing the standard model , and also for uncovering the trace of new physics .",
    "the simplest case is two - body nonleptonic @xmath15 meson decays , for which bauer , stech and wirbel proposed the factorization assumption ( fa ) in their pioneering work @xcite . considerable progress , including the generalized fa @xcite and qcd - improved fa ( qcdf ) @xcite , has been made since this proposal . on the other hand ,",
    "techniques to analyze hard exclusive hadronic scattering has been developed by brodsky and lepage @xcite based on collinear factorization theorem in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "a modified framework based on @xmath16 factorization theorem has been given in @xcite , and extended to exclusive @xmath15 meson decays in @xcite .",
    "the infrared finiteness and gauge invariance of @xmath16 factorization theorem was shown explicitly in @xcite . using the pqcd approach ,",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of nonleptonic @xmath15 meson decays @xcite .",
    "our observations are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "fa is approximately correct , as our computation shows that nonfactorizable contributions in charmless @xmath15 meson decays are negligible . 2 .",
    "penguin amplitudes are enhanced , as the pqcd formalism inludes dynamics from the energy region as low as @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 , being the @xmath15 meson and @xmath19 quark mass difference .",
    "note that @xmath17 is much lower than @xmath20(or @xmath21 ) which is often used as the energy scale .",
    "annihilation diagrams give rise to large short - distance strong phases through @xmath22 penguin operators .",
    "4 .   the sign and magnitude of cp asymmetries in two - body nonleptonic @xmath15 meson decays can be calculated , and we have predicted relatively large cp asymmetries in the @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 modes@xcite .    in this talk",
    "we summarize the pqcd method and important theoretical issues , and describe the analysis of branching ratios of b - meson decays including @xmath25 decays and discuss the origin of large direct cp - violation in @xmath8 process .",
    "* end point singularity and form factors : * if we calculate the @xmath26 transition form factor @xmath27 at large recoil using the brodsky - lepage formalism @xcite , a difficulty immediately occurs .",
    "the lowest - order diagram for the hard amplitude is proportional to @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the momentum fraction associated with the spectator quark on the @xmath15 meson side and @xmath30 the momentum fraction carried by the spectator quark in final pion . if the pion distribution amplitude vanishes like @xmath30 as @xmath31 ( in the leading - twist , _",
    "i.e. _ , twist-2 case ) , @xmath27 is logarithmically divergent . if the pion distribution amplitude is a constant as @xmath31 ( in the next - to - leading - twist , _",
    "i.e. _ , twist-3 case ) , @xmath27 even becomes linearly divergent .",
    "these end - point singularities have also appeared in the evaluation of the nonfactorizable and annihilation amplitudes in qcdf .",
    "note that in the above discussion parton transverse momenta @xmath32 has been neglected .",
    "more accurately , we have @xmath33 } \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] and the end - point singularity is smeared out .",
    "more precise analysis including the sudakov and threshold resummation effects has been given @xcite .",
    "in pqcd , we can calculate the form factors for @xmath34 transitions @xcite .",
    "the typical hard scale is about 1.5 gev as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "since the rg evolution of the wilson coefficients @xmath35 increase drastically as @xmath36 , while that of @xmath37 remain almost constant , we can get a large enhancement effects from both wilson coefficents and matrix elements in pqcd .",
    "in general the amplitude can be expressed as @xmath38 \\,\\ , \\cdot \\,\\ , < k\\pi|o|b > \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] with the chiral factors @xmath39 $ ] for pseudoscalar meson and @xmath40 for vector meson . to accommodate the @xmath41 data in fa and qcd - factorization approach ,",
    "one relies on the chiral enhancement by increasing @xmath42 to as large as about 3 gev at @xmath43 scale .",
    "so two methods accomodate large branching ratios of @xmath44 .",
    "but , there is no such adjustable parameter for @xmath45 decay .",
    "for @xmath45 there is no chiral factor in lcdas of the vector meson . here",
    "it is difficult to explain large penguin contribution in qcdf@xcite .",
    "we can test whether a dynamical enhancement or a chiral enhancement is responsible for the large @xmath44 branching ratios by measuring the @xmath47 modes . in these modes",
    "penguin contributions dominate , such that their branching ratios are insensitive to the variation of the unitarity angle @xmath9 .",
    "our prediction for various modes are shown at table 2 .",
    "we point out that qcdf can not globally fit the experimental data for @xmath48 and @xmath49 modes simultaneously with same sets of free parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "for this reason , annihilation contribution was not included in the general factorization approach and the first paper on qcd - factorization by beneke et al .",
    "in fact there is a suppression effect for the operators with structure @xmath104 because of a mechanism similar to the helicity suppression for @xmath105 .",
    "however annihilation from the operators @xmath106 with the structure @xmath107 via fiertz transformation survive under the helicity suppression",
    ". moreover , they provide large imaginary part .",
    "the real part of the factorized annihilation contribution becomes small because there is a cancellation between left - handed gluon exchanged diagram and right - handed gluon exchanged one as shown in table 1 of ref.@xcite .",
    "this mostly pure imaginary value of annihilation is a main source of large cp asymmetry in @xmath11 and @xmath108 decays . in table 3",
    "we summarize the cp asymmetry in @xmath109 decays with experimental measurements .",
    "we have seen that the dominant strong phase in pqcd comes from the factorizable annihilation diagram@xcite . for fa and qcdf ,",
    "stong phases come from the bander - silverman - soni ( bss ) mechanism@xcite and from the final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "in fact , the two sources of strong phases in the fa and qcdf are strongly suppressed by the charm mass threshold and by the end - point behavior of meson wave functions .",
    "so the strong phase in these approaches is almost zero without soft - annihilation contributions .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table3 ]    because we have a large imaginary contribution from factorized annihilation diagrams , we predict large cp asymmetry ( @xmath110 ) in @xmath0 decay and about @xmath111 cp violation effects in @xmath112 .",
    "the detail prediction is given in table 3 .",
    "the precise measurement of direct cp asymmetry ( both magnitude and sign ) is a crucial way to test factorization models which have different sources of strong phases .    in pqcd ,",
    "penguin contributions enhances both @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "as noted before , in fa and qcdf , the penguin enhancement can achieved by taking @xmath42 as large as 3 @xmath115 , however , they fail to explain the large branching ratio for @xmath116 decay .",
    "another hot issue is how can we understand @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath118 decay is penguin dominant process and @xmath119 decay is tree dominant one : @xmath120 , it is hard to get the same branching ratio .",
    "pqcd method predicts @xmath121 and @xmath122 , which still has about factor 2 differences between them .",
    "we need more precise measurements on @xmath123 decay .",
    "[ fig : cpipi ]",
    "even though isospin analysis of @xmath8 can provide a clean way to determine @xmath7 , it might be difficult in practice because of the small branching ratio of @xmath125 .",
    "here we describe the time - dependent analysis of @xmath126 .",
    "since penguin contributions are sizable and are about 20 - 30 % of the total amplitude , we expect that direct cp violation can be large if strong phases are different in the tree and penguin diagrams .",
    "the ratio between penguin and tree amplitudes is @xmath127 ( here we use the c - convention notation ) and the strong phase difference between penguin and tree amplitudes @xmath128 .",
    "the time - dependent asymmetry measurement provides two equations for @xmath129 and @xmath130 in terms of three unknown variables @xmath131 and @xmath7@xcite .",
    "since pqcd provides us @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the allowed range of @xmath7 at present stage is determined as @xmath134 as shown in figure [ fig : cpipi ] .    according to the power counting rule in the pqcd approach ,",
    "the factorizable annihilation contribution with large imaginary part becomes big and give a negative strong phase from @xmath135 .",
    "therefore we have a relatively large strong phase in contrast to qcd - factorization ( @xmath136 ) and predict large direct cp violation effect in @xmath137 with @xmath138 , which will be tested by more precise experimental measurement within two years .    in the numerical analysis , since the data by belle collaboration@xcite is located outside allowed physical regions , we considered the recent babar measurement@xcite with @xmath139 c.l .",
    "interval taking into account the systematic errors :    * @xmath140 [ -0.54 , + 0.58 ] * @xmath141 [ -0.72 , + 0.12 ] .",
    "the central point of babar data corresponds to @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 when the standard model works .",
    "even though the data by belle collaboration@xcite is located outside allowed physical regions , we can have overlapped ranges within 2 @xmath145 bounds .",
    "[ fig : rk ]",
    "by using tree - penguin interference in @xmath146 versus @xmath147 , cp - averaged @xmath41 branching fraction may lead to non - trivial constaints on the @xmath9 angle@xcite . in order to determine @xmath9 , we need one more useful information on cp - violating rate differences@xcite .",
    "let s introduce the following observables : r_k & = & ( b^0k^+^- ) _ + ( b^+k^0^+ ) _ 0 = 1 -2 r_k cos cos_3 + r_k^2 + a_0 & = & ( |b^0 k^-^+ ) - ( b^0 k^+^- ) ( b^-|k^0 ^ - ) + ( b^+|k^0^+ )   + & = & a_cp(b^0 k^+^- ) r_k = -2 r_k sin_3 sin . where @xmath148 is the ratio of tree to penguin amplitudes in @xmath41 and @xmath149 is the strong phase difference between tree and penguin amplitides .",
    "after eliminating @xmath150 in eq.(8)-(9 ) , we have r_k = 1 + r_k^2 . here",
    "we obtain @xmath151 from the pqcd analysis and @xmath152 by combining recent babar measurement on cp asymmetry of @xmath153 : @xmath154 @xcite with present world averaged value of @xmath155@xcite .",
    "pqcd method provides @xmath156 , @xmath157 and the negative @xmath158 : @xmath159 . as shown in fig.2",
    ", we can constrain the allowed range of @xmath9 within @xmath160 range of world averaged @xmath161 as follows :    * for @xmath162 , @xmath163 : we can exclude @xmath164 .",

    "when we take the central value of @xmath165 , @xmath9 is allowed within the ranges of @xmath169 , which is consistent with the results by the model - independent ckm - fit in the @xmath170 plane .",
    "* large @xmath171 in @xmath4 decays : * being free from the end - point singularities , all topologies of decay amplitudes of charmed decays can be computed in the pqcd approach , including the nonfactorizable color - suppressed diagram .",
    "this amplitude can not be calculated in the qcdf approach based on collinear factorization theorem because of the existence of the singularities .",
    "however , we found that this amplitude is crucial for explaining the observed @xmath172 branching ratios , since it is not suppressed by the wilson coefficient ( proportional to @xmath173 ) , and provides a large strong phase required by the isospin relation .",
    "the tree annihilation amplitude , also contributing to the strong phase , is not important . as stated above ,",
    "we have predicted large strong phases from the scalar - penguin annihilation amplitudes , which are required by the large cp asymmetries in two - body charmless decays .",
    "the success in predicting the strong phases from the nonfactorizable color - suppressed amplitudes for the two - body charmed decays further supports @xmath16 factorization theorem .",
    "the conclusion is that the short - distance strong phase is sufficient to account for the @xmath172 data .",
    "a long - distance strong phase from final - state interaction may be small , though it should exist .",
    "finally we obtained @xmath174 and @xmath175 by including annihilation contributions@xcite .",
    "in this talk we have discussed ingredients of pqcd approach and some important theoretical issues with numerical results . the pqcd factorization approach provides a useful theoretical framework for a systematic analysis on non - leptonic two - body b - meson decays .",
    "specially pqcd predicted large direct cp asymmetries in @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 decays , which will be a crucial touch stone to distinguish pqcd approach from others in future precise measurement .",
    "we discussed two methods to determine weak phases @xmath7 and @xmath9 within the pqcd approach through 1 ) time - dependent asymmetries in @xmath179 , 2 ) @xmath41 processes via penguin - tree interference .",
    "we can get interesting bounds on @xmath7 and @xmath9 from present experimental measurements . from babar measurement of cp asymmetry in @xmath11 decay",
