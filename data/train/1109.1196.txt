    "ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) interact with the cosmic microwave background and produce a cutoff structure in their energy spectrum ( gzk cutoff ) at the energy around @xmath3 ev as predicted by greisen , zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite@xcite . the hires group reported that there is a gzk cut - off in their observed energy spectrum at the energy it was predicted @xcite@xcite .",
    "a similar suppression in the energy spectrum is reported by the auger experiment in the southern hemisphere @xcite . however , the agasa experiment observed a spectrum which continued unabatedly with 11 events beyond the gzk cutoff @xcite@xcite . to understand this discrepancy ,",
    "the telescope array ( ta ) experiment was constructed in the desert area near the town of delta in utah , the usa .",
    "it is a hybrid detector consisting of surface detector ( sd ) array and three fluorescence detector ( fd ) stations .",
    "it measures the energy spectrum , anisotropy and composition of uhecrs to identify their origin .",
    "the ta has three fd stations called `` black rock mesa''(br ) , `` long ridge''(lr ) and `` middle drum''(md ) , which have been installed surrounding the sd array .",
    "the br site ( 1404 m a.s.l . ) is located at the southeast corner of the sd array while the lr site ( 1554 m a.s.l . )",
    "is to the southwest .",
    "the br and lr stations each have 12 telescopes . the md site ( 1610 m a.s.l . )",
    "is located at the northwest , and has 14 telescopes .",
    "the fd stations overlook an array of 507 sds .",
    "the uv fluorescence light generated by an air shower is scattered and lost along the path of transmission to the telescope .",
    "the main scattering processes are rayleigh scattering by molecules and scattering by aerosols in the atmosphere . the rayleigh scattering process is well understood and the attenuation length can be calculated using the rayleigh scattering cross - section and the molecular densities of the atmosphere @xcite@xcite@xcite . in order to calculate the molecular densities of the atmosphere , radiosonde data from elko(nevada ) are used to obtain temperature , pressure and humidity around the ta observatory as a function of height .",
    "sizes , shapes and spatial distribution of aerosols around the site are not known , and are variable with time .",
    "therefore , on - site monitoring of aerosols is essential in a fluorescence experiment .    in the ta",
    ", we employ a variety of measurements for atmospheric monitoring , using two laser systems and a cloud camera .",
    "the first laser system is the lidar ( light detection and ranging , we call lidar ) installed near the br station , which injects a pulsed laser light in the atmosphere and observes the back - scattered light at the same location .",
    "lidar is widely used in ground based aerosol measurement .",
    "the lidar system is operated before the beginning and after the end of an fd observation , twice a night .",
    "the second laser system is located at the geographical center of the three fd stations .",
    "it fires a vertical laser beam of @xmath4 and the scattered light by the atmosphere is observed by each fluorescence detector station .",
    "this system is called clf ( central laser facility ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "we are shooting 300 shots of laser at @xmath5 from the clf every 30 minutes during fd observation .",
    "in addition , we installed an infrared ccd camera for cloud monitoring near the lidar system , and take pictures of the night sky every hour during fd observation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the weather monitors are installed in each of the fd stations and at the clf to obtain the atmospheric status at the ground level .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the lidar system ( section @xmath6 ) , the data set and the analysis method ( section @xmath7 ) , the determination of the rayleigh scattering by the radiosonde data ( section @xmath8 ) , the result of aerosol scattering by the lidar data ( section @xmath9 ) , and a model of atmospheric transparency at the ta site ( section @xmath10 ) .",
    "a photograph of the lidar system is shown fig.@xmath11 .",
    "the lidar is composed of five basic system blocks .",
    "those are ( 1 ) a laser , ( 2 ) a steerable telescope , ( 3 ) a photo - multiplier tube , ( 4 ) a digital oscilloscope , and ( 5 ) a control system as shown in fig.@xmath12(b ) .",
    "we use an air cooled nd : yag laser ( orion model by new wave research ) with a third harmonic oscillation module ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the laser fires a pulse with the width of @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "the maximum energy of the laser pulse is @xmath16 .",
    "a meade lx200gps-30 telescope with a diameter of 305 mm and a focal length of 3048 mm is used with a photo - multiplier tube ( hamamatsu r3479 ) mounted at the focus of the telescope .",
    "a linear range of the pmt was checked by simultaneously firing a series of uv - led pulses at the telescope overlaying with the laser shot , and confirming that the overlaid signal has the same charge as the led - only signal without the laser shot .",
    "the laser is attached to the telescope mount , therefore the direction control of the laser - telescope - pmt system can be simply accomplished by commands to the telescope mount .",
    "the back - scattered photons from the laser are collected by the telescope , detected by the pmt , and the signals are digitized with a digital oscilloscope ( tektronix 3034b ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "in addition , a portion of each laser shot is picked off for measurement by an energy monitor .    by measuring the time structure of the back - scattered photons",
    ", we can determine the atmospheric conditions including aerosol distributions along the path of the laser beam .",
    "the operation of the lidar is composed of horizontal shots in the north and vertical shots .",
    "the vertical operation was made in high ( @xmath17 ) and low ( @xmath18 ) energies in order to measure the extinction coefficient @xmath19 over a large range .",
    "the horizontal operation uses only the high energy . in each vertical and horizontal operation , 500 laser pulses are shot and recorded . a total of 1500 shots composed one lidar operation .",
    "the pedestal level is measured in between each shot and is subtracted from the laser shot data in order to account for the background . in the following analysis , we use an average of the pmt signal profiles in order to reduce shot - to - shot fluctuations .",
    "cc     as a function of the distance @xmath20 . ]     as a function of the distance @xmath20 . ]",
    "a waveform @xmath21 is obtained by averaging the pmt signal for 500 laser shots .",
    "a range corrected power return @xmath22 of the lidar is defined by the waveform @xmath21 as a function of the distance @xmath20 from the lidar .",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 is the speed of light and @xmath25 is the time from the laser shot .",
    "the solid angle correction is taken into account in the definition of @xmath22 .",
    "an example of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is shown in fig.@xmath26 and fig.@xmath27 .",
    "the extinction coefficient @xmath28 at a distance @xmath20 is related with @xmath22 by the lidar equation ; @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the back - scattering coefficient .",
    "the factor 2 of @xmath19 indicates a round - trip photon propagation .",
    "if the atmosphere is spatially uniform along @xmath20 , such as the case for the horizontal shots , @xmath31 and @xmath22 becomes exponential .",
    "we can exactly solve the equation and obtain the extinction coefficient @xmath28 ( the slope method @xcite@xcite ) .    in the case of vertical laser shots , where the atmospheric condition ( @xmath19 and @xmath30 ) changes with @xmath20 , we need an additional assumption on the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath30 and also a boundary condition to solve the equation . in klett s",
    "method @xcite@xcite , a boundary condition is assumed that @xmath19 at enough high altitude is given by that of rayleigh scattering because the aerosol scattering can be neglected at high altitude .",
    "the back - scattering coefficient @xmath30 is assumed to be @xmath32 .",
    "the value of @xmath33 is 1.00 for the molecular atmosphere but is known to vary significantly ( @xmath34 ) for the atmosphere heavily loaded by the aerosol or with rain and snow @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , for a typical desert atmosphere of the ta site , we found that the aerosol contribution increases towards the lower altitude and that it modifies the value of @xmath33 from 1.00 at the high altitude up to 1.14 near the ground . in solving eq .",
    "( @xmath35 ) by klett s method , we assume that @xmath30 is in proportion to @xmath19 for the whole interval of @xmath20 .",
    "we estimate a systematic error caused by this assumption by the iterative method ( see section @xmath9 ) .    the extinction coefficient at the distance @xmath20 is thus calculated from the acquired waveform @xmath21 by adopting the slope method for horizontal shots or the klett s method for the vertical shots .",
    "the obtained extinction coefficient , @xmath36 , contains effects of both attenuation processes caused by rayleigh and aerosol scattering .",
    "the extinction coefficient by the aerosol scattering @xmath37 is obtained using a relation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the extinction coefficient by rayleigh scattering .",
    "the lidar operation has been performed 515 times from september 2007 to october 2009 . out of 515 operations",
    ", we passed 325 operations to the detailed analysis after removing the operations performed under apparent bad weather or bad atmospheric conditions , with irregular forms of @xmath22 caused by the existence of clouds and other scatters , and of hardware troubles .",
    "two selection criteria on the data quality , the first for the horizontal shots and the second for the vertical shots , are then applied on 325 samples .",
    "firstly , we discarded the data with @xmath36 on the ground level larger than @xmath40 because the atmosphere is too hazy for meaningful measurement .",
    "we are left with 250 operations after this cut .",
    "secondly , we accepted only measurements for which the lowest viable data is below @xmath41 and the highest viable data is above @xmath42 .",
    "a total of 137 operations have passed the second cut .",
    "these two conditions indicate a transparent atmosphere and the altitudinal distribution of @xmath36 can be derived from the observed lidar data with high accuracy . in section @xmath9 , we use these 137 lidar measurements for characterizing the aerosol scattering .",
    "the molecules ( nitrogen and oxygen ) are the main sources of photon scattering in the atmosphere .",
    "the scattering processes of photons of wavelengths in the range between @xmath43 and @xmath44 nm @xcite , which is the sensitivity band used in air fluorescence experiments , are well described by atmospheric molecules based on the rayleigh scattering theory .",
    "we can calculate the attenuation of the photon intensity , or the extinction coefficient , from the rayleigh scattering cross - section and the molecular density of the atmosphere .",
    "the former can be calculated with an accuracy of  1% @xcite and the latter is obtained by the measured distribution of atmospheric temperature and pressure employing the equation of state @xcite .",
    "we investigated radiosonde data of several stations around the ta site to determine the atmospheric conditions .",
    "worldwide balloon - borne radiosonde measurements are carried out at more than 900 launch stations twice a day at 0:00 and 12:00 utc , and various atmospheric parameters including temperature and pressure are recorded along the altitude up to 30 km above the sea level .",
    "we examined the data from 5 radiosonde stations within 500 km range of the ta site , and found that the atmospheric parameters obtained from the elko(nevada ) are most suitable for ta data analysis .",
    "elko is located about @xmath45 northwest of the ta site .",
    "it is at a similar altitude to the ta site and has similar climate , temperature , and precipitation .    in calculation of the extinction coefficients of rayleigh scattering ,",
    "we use monthly averages of the atmospheric parameters at 00:00 and 12:00 .",
    "the distribution of monthly averages of @xmath39 from january 2007 to december 2009 is shown in fig.@xmath46 .",
    "the average of @xmath39 at the ground level and its standard deviation are @xmath47 , which translates in an average attenuation length of rayleigh scattering of @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "the systematic error of @xmath39 is approximately @xmath50 coming from the inaccuracy of the rayleigh scattering cross - section . at the ta site ( @xmath51 a.s.l . )",
    ", an average temperature of @xmath52 and atmospheric pressure of @xmath53 at the ground level is measured .     at @xmath54 . ]",
    "the aerosol component consists of large molecules and particles of sizes up to @xmath55 cm .",
    "it influences the light scattering mostly at the low altitude .",
    "the light scattering by a sphere of a given size is described by mie scattering theory , however , it is difficult to apply the theory for light scattering in the lower atmosphere because we do not know shape and the spatial distribution of the aerosols a priori .",
    "the method used in this analysis is as follows .",
    "first , a total extinction coefficient @xmath36 that is the sum of rayleigh scattering and aerosol scattering is determined using the lidar data , in a unit of @xmath56 , as a function of the height .",
    "next , we calculate the extinction coefficient of rayleigh scattering @xmath39 using the radiosonde data . finally , the extinction coefficient of aerosol scattering @xmath37 is calculated by assuming @xmath57 .",
    "cc            the aerosols are more prevalent at the ground surface and decrease as a function of the height .",

    "examples of extinction coefficient obtained from the measurement for the different distributions of aerosol scattering are shown in fig.@xmath64(a)@xmath65(d ) .",
    "the @xmath36 obtained at the ground level by the horizontal shooting and the distribution of @xmath36 measured by the vertical shooting are shown in the closed circle and the crosses in fig.@xmath64 respectively . for vertical shots ( crosses ) , we used data only above @xmath66 for which the linear response of the pmt was confirmed by the uv - led calibration .",
    "the data points above 8 km are removed because the collected photon signal is too small .",
    "the solid line of fig.@xmath64 represents @xmath39 calculated for pure rayleigh scattering ( see section @xmath8 ) .",
    "finally the open square boxes in fig.@xmath64 represent the altitudinal distribution of @xmath67 .",
    "the systematic error of @xmath67 is @xmath68 from the linearity calibration of the pmt , @xmath69 from the assumption of @xmath70 for klett s method .",
    "the latter is estimated by iteration ; at first , the aerosol contribution was obtained by the klett s integration with the assumption @xmath71 , then the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath30 was recalculated at each altitude assuming the aerosol phase function obtained by the hires experiment @xcite and the second klett s integration was performed .",
    "we found the second integration gives a correction of @xmath72 or less at any altitude of the typical atmosphere .",
    "in order to understand the aerosol contribution with respect to the height , we define a height below which the @xmath37 is greater than @xmath73 , @xmath74 aerosol scattering is no longer negligible .",
