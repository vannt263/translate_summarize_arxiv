    "for reliable realization of quantum feedback control , it is indispensable to take into consideration some real - world limitations , such as incomplete knowledge of the physical systems and poor performance of the control devices .",
    "various efforts on these issues have been undertaken in these few years , see e.g. , @xcite for the system parameter uncertainty . among such limitations , time delays in the feedback loop , which happen due to the finite computational speed of _ classical _ controller devices ,",
    "are extremely serious , since their effect may completely lose the benefit of feedback control @xcite . to avoid the time delays",
    ", one can think to use the markovian feedback control , in which the measurement results are directly fed back @xcite .",
    "however , while these experimental simplification has been extensively studied , theoretical ways to evaluate the effect of the time delays have not been proposed so far .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of the time delays on the control performance , which is defined in terms of the cost function optimized by feedback control .",
    "this investigation provides theoretical guidelines for the feedback control experiment . as the controlled object",
    ", the linear quantum systems are considered . in order to prepare the tool for the analysis",
    ", we first consider the optimal lqg control problem subject to the constant time delay .",
    "the optimal controller is obtained via the existing results in the classical control theory @xcite .",
    "further , these results allow us to obtain the formula for the optimal value of the cost .",
    "the obtained formula enables us to examine the relation between the optimal control performance and the time delay both in an analytical and a numerical ways .",
    "then , the intrinsic stability of the systems is dominant for the performance degradation effect .",
    "if the system is stable , the degradation effect converges to some value in the large time delay limit .",
    "otherwise , the performance monotonically deteriorates as the delay length becomes larger .",
    "based on this fact , we perform the analysis stated above for several physical systems that possess different stability properties .",
    "in addition to the controller design , we examine the relationship between the measurement apparatus and the best achievable performance . based on this",
    ", we propose a detector parameter tuning policy for feedback control of the time - delayed systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "linear quantum control systems are introduced in the next section . in section iii , we state the control problem for dealing with the time delay issue , and provide its optimal solution . in section iv , we investigate the effect of the time delay in quantum feedback control based on two typical examples possessing different stability properties .",
    "section v concludes the paper .",
    "we use the following notation . for a matrix @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are defined by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , where the matrix element @xmath7 may be an operator and @xmath8 denotes its adjoint .",
    "the symbols @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the real and imaginary parts of @xmath11 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . all the rules above are applied to any rectangular matrix .",
    "consider a quantum system which interacts with a vacuum electromagnetic field through the system operator @xmath14 where @xmath15{^{\\sf t}}$ ] and @xmath16\\in{{\\mathbb c}}^{1\\times 2}$ ] .",
    "when the system hamiltonian is denoted by @xmath17 , this interaction is described by a unitary operator @xmath18 obeying the following quantum stochastic differential equation called the _ hudson - parthasarathy equation _",

    "the field operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the creation and annihilation operator processes , which satisfy the following quantum it rule : @xmath23 further , suppose that the system is trapped in a harmonic potential , and that a linear potential is an input to the system .",
    "the system hamiltonian @xmath24 at time @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the control input at time @xmath25 , the system parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 are a symmetric matrix and a column vector , and @xmath30 is given by @xmath31}.\\ ] ] then , by defining @xmath32{^{\\sf t}}=[u_t q u_t^\\dagger , u_t p u_t^\\dagger]{^{\\sf t}}$ ] and by using the commutation relation @xmath33=i$ ] and the quantum it formula , we obtain the following linear equation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "measurement processes are described as follows .",
    "suppose that the field observable @xmath36 is measured by the perfect homodyne detector , where @xmath37 denotes the detector parameter that the experimenter can change @xcite .",
    "then , the output signal @xmath38 is obtained by @xmath39 the simple calculation yields the infinitesimal increment of the observable @xmath38 as follows : @xmath40 in the following section , we refer to ( [ system ] ) and ( [ output ] ) as the system dynamics and the output equation , respectively .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the effect of time delays is significant in feedback control of quantum systems .",
    "those delays are mainly originated from the computational time for a controller and the transition delay of signals .",
    "thus , they should be modelled practically as input - output delays in the feedback loop , i.e. , at time @xmath25 , the signal @xmath41 works as a control input for the system and the information @xmath42 is available in the controller , where we assume that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constants . without loss of generality",
    ", when we consider the optimal control problem for such a system , the total delay time can be simply put together into one input ( or output ) delay .",

    "in the experiment of the feedback control , it is of importance to reduce the time delay by carefully setting up the experimental devices and achieve the best performance possible @xcite .",

    "we investigate how the time delay deteriorates the optimal control performance by using the formula ( [ performance ] ) .",
    "in addition to the algorithm in the controller , we have the tunable parameter in the measurement apparatus .",
    "thus , we do the analysis taking the detector parameter tuning into consideration .",
