    "recently the kamland experiment has measured @xmath0 with great accuracy @xcite .",
    "their fit to the data , assuming neutrino oscillations , gives the result : @xmath9 the error in this measurement , already as low as @xmath10 , can be further improved with more data .",
    "the accuracy of kamland in determining the mixing angle @xmath5 is not so good .",
    "the reason , for this great disparity in the accuracies of the two oscillation parameters , is the following : the anti - neutrino survival probability , for two flavour oscillations , is given by @xmath11 this expression has minima when the energy takes the following values , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an integer .",
    "thus the position of the minimum is dictated by @xmath0 and the depth of the minimum is dictated by @xmath5 .",
    "the inverse beta - decay spectrum of positrons , measured by kamland as a function of the anti - neutrino energy , is a product of the spectrum in the case of no oscillations ( which is a smooth function ) and the above survival probability .",
    "the minima of the survival probability lead to kinks ( or distortions ) in the measured spectrum . given the baseline of kamland and the energy range of the anti - neutrinos only the minimum corresponding to @xmath14 is relevant . the position of the kink produced by this minimum can be measured with great accuracy which leads to @xmath0 being determined with great accuracy .",
    "the amount of distortion in the kink can be measured only with a limited accuracy which means that @xmath5 can be determined only with a limited accuracy .",
    "detailed stastical calculations also lead to the same conclusion @xcite .    given the accurate measurement of @xmath0 by kamland",
    ", it is worth raising the question : what is its impact on the solar neutrino problem ? in the @xmath15 plane , the allowed contours of global solar data and that of kamland data have a significant overlap @xcite .",
    "this overlap region is essentially what is obtained if an analysis of all solar neutrino and kamland data is performed @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , we address the following question : given @xmath16 ev@xmath3 , what predictions do we get for the solar neutrino spectrum ?",
    "we first analyze the neutrino survival probability ( @xmath1 ) of the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution of the solar neutrino problem assuming two flavour oscillations .",
    "we study the energy dependence of @xmath1 in detail as a function of the mixing angle @xmath5 and show how these details can be tested in the future by precise data from super - k and sno experiments .",
    "we then demonstrate that a potential conflict with future spectral measurements can be resolved by reanalyzing @xmath1 in a three flavour framework and by invoking a moderate value of @xmath17 .",
    "varying @xmath0 within the range allowed by kamland , does not change our conclusions .",
    "in this section we assume that only two mass eigenstates participate in the oscillations of electron neutrinos and those of their anti - neutrinos .",
    "this is equivalent to setting @xmath18 in three flavour oscillations @xcite and we have @xmath19 we also assume cpt invariance and take the mass - square difference measured by kamland to be @xmath0 .",
    "the electron neutrino survival probability , in the case of lma solution of the solar neutrino problem , is given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the matter dependent value of @xmath22 at the solar core and is given by , @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the wolfenstein term @xcite in the core of the sun and @xmath25 is the corresponding mass - squared difference .",
    "it is given by @xmath26 analysis of solar neutrino data @xcite restricts the @xmath27 range of @xmath22 to be @xmath28 , with the best fit at @xmath29 .    the data from various gallium experiments @xcite requires that the average @xmath1 for low energy ( @xmath30 mev ) should be about @xmath31 and super - k spectrum data requires that for high energy ( @xmath32 ) mev , @xmath1 should be essentially constant with a value of about @xmath33 @xcite . to see the variation of @xmath1 with respect to energy , we differentiate it and obtain @xmath34^{3/2}}.   \\label{dpeede}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we now point out the two essential features of eq .",
    "( [ dpeede ] ) .    *",
    "the slope of @xmath1 is steepest at the energy when @xmath35 .",
    "this energy of steepest slope is given by @xmath36 , where we have used the value of @xmath37 from kamland .",
    "* in the neighbourhood of @xmath38 , the slope achieves its maximum value of @xmath39 .",
    "this shows that smaller the value of the vacuum mixing angle greater will be the slope of @xmath1 in the neighbourhood of @xmath38 .",
    "vs @xmath40 for the energy range 5 - 15 mev for @xmath41 ev@xmath3 and for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "data points with @xmath44 error bars are obtained using the super - k data from @xcite.,scaledwidth=83.0% ]    in figure  1 , we have plotted @xmath1 vs @xmath40 , for three values of @xmath22 , which are the best fit value and the lower and the upper @xmath27 bounds obtained by global analysis . as stated earlier",
    ", the value of @xmath37 is fixed to be the kamland best fit value @xmath2 ev@xmath3 . to facilitate the comparison between lma predictions and the data , the spectrum data from super - k @xcite",
    "are also shown in the figure .",
    "we observe the following important features of each of these plots .    1 .   for a low value of @xmath45 , @xmath1 decreases sharply from @xmath46 at @xmath47 mev to @xmath48 at @xmath49 mev and further decreases to @xmath50 at @xmath51 mev",
    "this is in conflict with the essentially flat spectrum observed by super - k and sno for @xmath52 mev @xcite . for this value of @xmath22",
    ", the energy region of the steepest slope in @xmath1 is centered around @xmath53 .",
    "hence there is a sharp drop in the probability in this range .",
    "the average value of @xmath1 for this curve is close to the average @xmath1 measured by super - k but the sharp drop in the @xmath4 mev region means that the curve misses the points at both low and at high energies .",
    "2 .   for a high value of @xmath54",
    ", we do have a flat spectrum , but the average value of @xmath1 is @xmath55 , which is considerably higher than @xmath33 measured by super - k and sno @xcite .",
    "for this value of @xmath22 , the energy region of the steepest slope in @xmath1 is centered around @xmath56 , so the energy range @xmath4 mev is reasonably away from this point .",
    "the flat spectrum in this case is the consequence of @xmath22 being close to maximal mixing , i.e @xmath57 , in which case matter effects play no role and where @xmath1 is predicted to be close to @xmath58 for the whole energy range .",
    "3 .   for the best fit value of @xmath59",
    ", @xmath1 changes from @xmath55 at @xmath47 mev to @xmath60 at @xmath49 mev and further decreases to @xmath33 at @xmath51 mev . for this value of @xmath22",
    ", the energy region of the steepest slope in @xmath1 is centered around @xmath61 .",
    "the energy range @xmath4 mev is a little away from this point but well within the region where @xmath62 ( c.f . eq .  [ dpeede ] ) is not negligible .",
    "thus we find that low values of @xmath22 give the correct average value of @xmath1 in the energy range visible at super - k but predict a steep slope .",
    "high values of @xmath22 have flat spectrum but the average value of @xmath1 is much higher than that measured by super - k . the best fit value is a presently acceptable compromise between the two different pulls on @xmath22 generated by the two different features of @xmath1 , _ i.e. _ its average value and its slope .",
    "but even the best fit curve suffers from two objections when compared to the data .    1 .",
    "the predicted values of @xmath1 in the energy range @xmath4 mev are @xmath63 too high compared to the data .",
    "2 .   the predicted values show slope in the @xmath4 mev range which is not observed in the data .",
    "these features are also reflected in table  1 , where the present super - k data @xcite and the two flavour lma predictions for @xmath1 for the best fit value of @xmath22 are shown .",
    "if future data from super - k and sno reduce the error bars in these bins by a factor @xmath7 , and if the central values of the measurements do not change , then it must be concluded that two flavour oscillations are inadequate to explain both kamland data and the solar neutrino spectrum .",
    ".@xmath1 extracted from super - k spectral data vs the values predicted by the lma solution .",
    "all error bars are @xmath64 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we now consider three flavour oscillations with non - zero @xmath17 .",
    "we are concerned only with @xmath1 and @xmath65 which are independent of the mixing angle @xmath66 and cp - phase @xmath67 @xcite but do depend on @xmath17 . because @xmath68 , oscillations due to @xmath69 are averaged out at kamland and we have @xmath70 for this expression of @xmath65 also , the position of the kink in the positron spectrum depends only on @xmath37 and is independent of @xmath22 and @xmath17 .",
    "hence the value of @xmath37 determined by the spectral distortion data of kamland , even in the case of three flavour oscillations , is the same as in the case of two flavour oscillations and has the same accuracy .",
    "@xmath1 for solar neutrinos for the lma solution is given by @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is given by eq .",
    "( [ th12c ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ d21c ] ) , with the modification that @xmath73 in those equations should be replaced by @xmath74 .",
    "matter dependence of @xmath17 is given by @xmath75 ;   \\cos \\theta_{13}^c = \\cos \\theta_{13 } \\left[1 - \\frac{a^c}{\\delta_{31 } }   \\sin^2 \\theta_{13 } \\right ]   \\label{th13c}.\\ ] ] here @xmath76 for the whole energy range of solar neutrinos . hence in eq .",
    "( [ pee3 ] ) @xmath77 can be replaced by @xmath17 and @xmath1 , of three flavour oscillations , simplifies to : @xmath78 thus the solar neutrino survival probability in three flavour oscillations depends only on one additional parameter @xmath17 .",
    "analysis of only solar neutrino data allows @xmath79 @xcite and analysis of only atmospheric neutrino data allows @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "it is the chooz experiment , which in combination with the @xmath69 measurement from atmospheric neutrino data which sets a stringent upper bound on @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "present lower bound on @xmath69 from super - k data is @xmath81 ev@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "for this small a value of @xmath69 , chooz sets an upper bound of about @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the potential conflict between the lma predictions for @xmath41 ev@xmath3 and the super - k measurement of the solar spectrum can be naturally resolved in a three flavour oscillation framework . in the three flavour case , the energy range where @xmath83 is centered around the energy @xmath84 .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath22 , the strongest distortion is shifted to slightly higher energies as compared to the two flavour case . for even moderate values of @xmath17",
    ", @xmath85 differs appreciably from @xmath86 .",
    "hence , in three flavour oscillations , both @xmath1 and its slope become smaller , thus mitigating the two discrepancies between the solar spectrum data and lma predictions of two flavour oscillations @xcite .",
    "first we take a look at low energies , where @xmath87 mev . in this energy range the matter term @xmath88 and we have @xmath89 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ pee3sim ] ) simplifies to : @xmath90 if we set @xmath91 , eq.([pee3low ] ) gives us the usual low energy form for the lma solution .",
    "from the gallium experiments we have @xmath92 . in pure two flavour oscillations ,",
    "this data pulls @xmath22 towards @xmath93 .",
    "however , we see from eq .",
    "( [ pee3low ] ) that a moderate value of @xmath17 allows @xmath22 to differ appreciably from @xmath93 .    to study the behaviour at high energies it is convenient to recast eq.([pee3 ] ) as ,",
    "@xmath94 there is no immediate simplification of the above formula because for the solar neutrino energy range the wolfenstein term is never much larger than @xmath37 .",
    "hence we use the full expression and study its dependence on @xmath17 for the best fit value of @xmath22 , by means of graphs of @xmath95 .",
    "vs @xmath40 for the energy range 5 - 15 mev for @xmath41 ev@xmath3 , @xmath59 and @xmath96 . for comparison",
    ", super - k data @xcite with @xmath44 error bars also are included.,scaledwidth=83.0% ]    in fig.(2 ) , for @xmath97 , we plot @xmath1 for different values of @xmath17 along with the graph for @xmath91 .",
    "note that the effect of even moderate values of @xmath17 is to pull the predictions for @xmath1 towards the data , thus leading to a better agreement .",
    "recent kamland data has unambiguously picked the parameters in the lma region as the solution to the solar neutrino problem , confirming the expectations of global analyses of solar neutrino data .",
    "however , for the large value of @xmath37 obtained by kamland , there is a discrepancy between the two flavour predictions of @xmath1 and the super - k spectrum data for all allowed values of @xmath22 . for low values of @xmath22",
    "the discrepancy is in the slope of @xmath1 in the range @xmath4 mev and for larger values of @xmath22 the discrepancy is in the average value of @xmath1 in the energy range @xmath98 mev .",
    "this discrepancy can turn into a full fledged conflict if the error bars on the solar neutrino spectrum data can be reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "this conflict between the large value of @xmath37 and the super - k spectrum can be resolved in a three flavour oscillation analysis for moderate values of @xmath17 .",
    "a non zero value of @xmath17 of about @xmath99 can both reduce the average value of @xmath1 and give a flatter spectrum and the conflict with the spectrum measurement can be resolved .",
    "an equivalent and perhaps more striking way of looking at this analysis is that a careful study of solar neutrino spectrum gives us an handle on @xmath17 _ independent of the reactor constraints_. * acknowledgement * we thank ameeya bhagwat for his help in preparing the figures .",
