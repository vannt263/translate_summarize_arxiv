    "as the temperature of the cosmic bath decreases , atoms start to recombine and therefore decouple from the cmb radiation at redshift @xmath5 .",
    "the baryonic jeans mass immediately after this event is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the matter and baryon density parameters , respectively .",
    "masses larger than @xmath9 are gravitationally unstable and should , in principle , collapse . however , in order for the actual collapse to occur a more severe condition must be satisfied , that the cooling time of the gas is shorter than the hubble time at that epoch .",
    "in fact , radiative losses provide the only way for the gas to lose pressure and settle down in the potential well of the host dark matter halo .",
    "since the virial temperature corresponding to the masses of the first objects ( popiii ) is typically @xmath10  k , cooling by hydrogen ly@xmath11 excitation is strongly quenched , and the only viable coolant in a primordial h - he plasma is molecular hydrogen . is produced during the recombination phase , but its relic abundance is very small ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this primordial fraction is usually lower than the one required to fulfill the above time - scale constraint , but during the collapse phase the molecular hydrogen abundance reaches values that are high enough to allow the collapse to continue .",
    "it follows that the fate of a virialized lump depends crucially on its ability to rapidly increase its content during the collapse phase .",
    "haiman , thoul & loeb ( 1996 ) and tegmark ( 1997 ) have addressed this question by calculating the evolution of the abundance for different halo masses and initial conditions for a standard cdm cosmology .",
    "they conclude that if the prevailing conditions are such that a molecular hydrogen fraction of order of @xmath13 can be produced during the collapse , then the lump will cool , fragment and eventually form stars . this criterion is met only by the largest popiiis , implying that at each virialization redshift one can define a critical mass , @xmath14 , such that only protogalaxies with total mass @xmath15 will be able to eventually form stars . as an example",
    ", a 3@xmath16 fluctuation of a cold dark matter primordial spectrum , has @xmath17 and collapses at @xmath18 .",
    "other studies have revised the value of @xmath14 as a result of a more accurate treatment of the micro - physics ( nishi & susa 1999 ; fuller & couchman 2000 ; machacek , bryan & abel 2001 ) ; however , these results do not qualitatively alter the basic argument given above .",
    "recently , some works have started to tackle the formation and collapse of popiii objects through numerical simulations ( abel 1998 ; nakamura & umemura 1999 ; nakamura & umemura 2001 ; bromm , coppi & larson 1999 , 2001 ; abel , bryan & norman 2000 - abn00 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2001 - bcl01 ; bromm 2001 ) based on hierarchical scenarios of structure formation .",
    "these studies have shown that gravitational collapse induces fragmentation of the first pregalactic objects with initial baryonic mass @xmath19 into smaller clumps of typical mass of about @xmath20 , which corresponds to the jeans mass set by molecular hydrogen cooling .",
    "tracking the subsequent evolution of these clumps is a very challenging problem as it requires the simultaneous solution of the hydrodynamic equations and of radiative transfer in lines . at present , due to the tremendous computational demand ,",
    "this as only been possible in one dimensional formulations of the problem .",
    "star formation in the early universe naively appears easier to understand as compared to the present , because several complicating effects can be neglected to a first approximation : among these are magnetic fields , dust grains and metal enrichment .    in their pioneering work ,",
    "omukai & nishi ( 1998 ) ( on98 ) showed that at a certain stage of the collapse a quasi - hydrostatic central core is formed whose specific mass is almost independent on the details of the problem , with a typical value of @xmath21 .",
    "however , as the accretion rate of the infalling gas is found to be rather high , around @xmath22  yr@xmath23 , the core mass at its formation might be unimportant in setting the final mass of the star . in the absence of any effect quenching accretion ,",
    "a large fraction of the initial object can become soon part of the protostar . pushing this conclusion a bit further",
    ", one might predict a top heavy imf for this first generation of sources .",
    "if the infall can instead be stopped , different scenarios can be envisaged .",
    "it has yet to be firmly established if standard ways proposed to halt the infall continue to work under primordial conditions : radiation force might be opacity limited ; bipolar flows need some mhd acceleration process and therefore seem to be excluded by the weak magnetic field present at the main formation epoch ( gnedin , ferrara & zweibel 2000 ) , although the magnetic field could be amplified during the protostar formation process .",
    "angular momentum barrier related to disk formation and competitive accretion among different clumps are slightly more promising , but much more difficult to model accurately .",
    "the estimate of the first mechanism ( radiation reaction ) requires to accurately derive the properties of the radiation field produced during the collapse and to evaluate the effects of the radiation force on the infalling envelope .",
    "this is one of the main aims of the present paper .",
    "the second motivation for our study consists in assessing the detection chances of distant popiii objects via the ( infrared ) radiation they release during the collapse phase .",
    "ciardi & ferrara ( 2001 ) have already pointed out that ir molecular lines produced by the cooling of supernova shocked popiii gas will be very likely observed by the _ next generation space telescope_. however , as roto - vibrational lines are essentially the only carrier of the entire gravitational energy release , it seems worthwhile to compute the intensity , shape and evolution of the emitted spectrum in detail . recently ,",
    "kamaya & silk ( 2001 ) ( ks01 ) have estimated the luminosity from primordial collapsing stars using a very approximated treatment .    to investigate the described problem we have performed 1d numerical simulations including a detailed treatment of the molecular line radiative transfer .",
    "the study is germane to the one of on98 but it includes the radiative force term in the dynamical equations adding a number of imporvement , as we outline throughout the paper . the paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we present our numerical methodology .",
    "the choice and justification for the initial conditions , and the results of the simulation are discussed in  3 . in ",
    "4 we discuss the luminosities and the detectability , and in the final section we give a brief summary .",
    "we developed a 1-d lagrangian hydrodynamical code , including full treatment of radiative transfer and chemical evolution ( with careful treatment of the molecule , which is the main coolant in the initial phases of the collapse ) .",
    "such code is similar to the one described by on98 .",
    "here we only summarize the relevant differences between the two ; a more detailed description is given in the appendix .",
    "we included the radiative force term into the momentum equation , which then becomes    @xmath24    where we are exploiting the spherical symmetry , and where @xmath25 is the radiative force per unit mass , @xmath26 is the specific energy flux at frequency @xmath27 ( both @xmath28 and @xmath26 are considered in the radial outward direction ) , and @xmath29 is the opacity at the frequency @xmath27 .      as discussed by several authors (  hummer & mihalas , 1988 ; mihalas , dppen & hummer , 1988 ; saumon , chabrier & van horn , 1995 ;",
    "hereafter scvh95 ) , at high densities ( @xmath30 ) particles are jammed closely together , and the bound electron orbitals filling too large a volume fail to survive so that electrons migrate from atom to atom .",
    "such an effect is known as _ pressure ionization _ and generally it is not taken into account in the saha equations . as an example , a pure hydrogen gas with @xmath31 g @xmath32 and @xmath33 k is largely ionized ( the mean distance between nuclei is only twice the bohr radius of an h atom on the fundamental level , and the electrons are free in a fermi gas , interacting simultaneously with several ions ) , while solving the saha equations results in a completely molecular gas , which is clearly unphysical . in such regimes ,",
    "the gas is also non - ideal , and the perfect gas equations are poor approximations .    for these reasons ,",
    "at high densities and temperatures we find the chemical abundances and thermodynamical properties ( such as the pressure @xmath34 , the internal energy per unit mass @xmath35 and the entropy per unit mass @xmath36 ) by interpolation of the values tabulated by scvh95 , which are calculated using the _ free energy minimization _ technique .",
    "scvh95 calculations include several non - ideal effects , such as , ( a ) the partial electron degeneracy , ( b ) the coulomb interactions among charged particles , ( c ) the finite extension of `` hard - sphere '' particles , ( d ) weak attractive interactions ( van der waals ) , and ( e ) modifications of the internal partition functions due to the shift of the energy levels .",
    "the main parameters specifying the initial condition of our runs are : the total cloud mass @xmath37 , the temperature , density , and velocity profiles @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , respectively , and the hydrogen molecular fraction @xmath41 .",
    "several previous investigations set constraints on such parameters .",
    "theoretical predictions of the mass of fragments leading to the birth of the first stars are quite uncertain , ranging from a minimum of @xmath42 ( palla , salpeter & stahler 1983 ) , to @xmath43 ( hutchins 1976 ) . on the other hand , there is agreement about the value of @xmath44 , and about the value of @xmath38 which is of order of few hundreds degrees ( tegmark 1997 ) .",
    "detailed numerical simulations ( bcl01 , abn00 ) suggest that the runaway collapse starts soon after the ( number ) density reaches a value of @xmath45 .",
    "such value is determined by the transition from non - lte cooling ( with @xmath46 ) to lte cooling ( with @xmath47 ) , slowing down the contraction , and allowing the gas to reach a quasi - hydrostatic state .",
    "this transition occurs when @xmath48  k and @xmath49 , inside a cloud with a mass of a few thousand @xmath50 , a value close to the jeans mass of the cloud .    to check how our results depend on the choice of the initial conditions , we run a set of models with different initial mass @xmath37 , ranging from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "we use a constant profile for the abundance and zero velocity ( the cloud is at rest ) .",
    "the density and temperature profiles inside the cloud are derived imposing hydrostatic equilibrium and a polytropic index equal to 5/3 or 1 ( isothermal ) .",
    "in addition we have considered ` numerical ' profiles as given by abn00 from cosmological simulations . in runs",
    "p10 , due to the high value of the initial central density , we used a higher value for @xmath41 .",
    "the initial electron fraction adopted is @xmath53 .",
    "with the exception of run p100/2 , we always divide our simulated cloud into 100 lagrangian shells , with massive external shells and much lighter internal ones ( , in run p100 each external shell comprises @xmath54 of gas , while the central one has a mass of only @xmath55 ) .",
    "such choice is aimed to follow with good resolution the fast evolution of the centre of the cloud , which accounts only for a tiny fraction of the total mass .",
    "details of the initial conditions and general set up are given in table [ initial_c ] .",
    "note that runs p100 and p10 are directly comparable to those of on98 .",
    "run p100/2 is identical to run p100 , but the object is divided into 140 ( rather than 100 ) shells ; the `` extra '' shells were used to improve the resolution in the particularly important region where the shock forms ( @xmath56 ) .",
