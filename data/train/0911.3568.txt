    "the standard model ( sm ) based on the local gauge group @xmath8 @xcite , with all its successes , fails to explain several fundamental issues such as : hierarchical charged fermion masses , fermion mixing , charge quantization , strong cp violation , replication of families , neutrino masses and oscillations  @xcite , etc .. all this make us think that we must call for extensions of the model .",
    "the flavor problem encloses two of the most intriguing puzzles in modern particle physics , which are the number of fermion families in nature and the pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles , both in the quark and lepton sectors . with each family being anomaly - free by itself ,",
    "the sm renders , on theoretical grounds , the number of generations completely unrestricted , except for the indirect bound imposed by the asymptotic freedom of the strong interactions theory , based on the local gauge group @xmath9 , also known as quantum cromo dynamics or qcd .",
    "many attempts to answer the question of hierarchical quark masses and mixing angles for three families have been reported in the literature , using the top quark as the only heavy quark at the weak scale @xcite . but",
    "further insight into the flavor problem can be gained by contemplating the existence of additional heavy quarks .",
    "popular and well motivated extension of the sm which containt extra heavy quarks are based on the local gauge group  @xcite @xmath0 ( called hereafter 3 - 3 - 1 for short ) . the several possible structures enlarge the sm in its gauge , scalar , and fermion sectors .",
    "let us mention some outstanding features of 3 - 3 - 1 models :    * the simple models are free of gauge anomalies , if and only if the number of families is a multiple of three  @xcite ( becoming just three by imposing qcd asymptotic freedom ) . *",
    "a peccei - quinn chiral symmetry can be implemented easily  @xcite .",
    "* one quark family has different quantum numbers than the other two , fact that may be used to explain the heavy top quark mass  @xcite . *",
    "the scalar sector includes several good candidates for dark matter  @xcite . *",
    "the lepton content is suitable for explaining some neutrino properties  @xcite . *",
    "the hierarchy in the yukawa coupling constants can be avoided by implementing several universal see - saw mechanisms  @xcite .    in the sm with three generations ,",
    "the quark mixing matrix , called in the literature the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix  @xcite , is a @xmath1 unitary matrix . as a consequence of this unitary character , and for models with only one sm higgs doublet , the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are absent at tree level , with a strong suppression of the same fcnc at the one - loop level , due to the existence of the glashow - iliopoulos - miani ( gim ) mechanism  @xcite . for the minimall 3 - 3 - 1 model of pisano - pleitez and frampton",
    "@xcite the quark mixing matrix is the same ckm mixing matrix of the sm , but fcnc at tree level appears due to the existence of a new , non - universal neutral gauge boson  @xcite .    in this analysis",

    "a classification of all those models has been presented allready in refs .",
    "as far as the quark content is concerned , all the three family 3 - 3 - 1 models without exotic electric charges fall into four categories : * category a * which includes models with four up - type quarks and five down - type quarks , * category b * which includes models with five up - type quarks and four down - type quarks , * category c * for models with six up - type quarks and three down - type quarks , and * category d * for models with three up - type quarks and six down - type quarks .",
    "for all the models in the four categories above , the number of up - type quarks is not equal to the number of down - type quarks and thus , the quark mixing matrix looses its unitary character .",
    "one outstanding consequence of a nonunitary mixing matrix is the existence of new fcnc processes .",
    "our aim in this analysis is to see , in the context of some 3 - 3 - 1 models without exotic electric charges , how large the mixing between the ordinary and exotic quarks can be , without violating current experimental measurements , both in the @xmath1 ordinary quark mixing matrix and in the values and bounds measured for fcnc processes .",

    "[ sec : sec3 ] we review the gauge boson , the fermion , and the scalar content of the 3 - 3 - 1 model with right handed neutrinos , calculate the effective tree - level hamiltonian for fcnc and introduce the most general quark mass matrices for this model , in sec .",

    "the basic motivation of the present work was to study fcnc effects in the context of the 3 - 3 - 1 models with right - handed neutrinos . for this model",
    "there are four up - type quarks and five down - type quarks and its quark mixing matrix fails to be unitary .",
    "besides , a new non - universal neutral current , able to produce fcnc effects at the tree level is present for this model .    for this analysis we searched for the largest mixing between ordinary and exotic quarks without violating current experimental constrains in the quark mixing matrix and in the values and bounds measured for fcnc processes .    even though our analysis is  ansatz \" dependent , two main approaches , with different consequences , can be distinguish : the first one characterized by a value of @xmath185 and the second one for a value @xmath316 . for the first approach the mixing of the ordinary quarks with the exotic ones is large , the penguin contributions to the fcnc are relevant and the tree - level meson mixing are perfectly under control for a mass @xmath286 at the tev scale . for the second approach the mixing of the ordinary quarks with the exotic ones is small , the penguin contribution to the fcnc are negligible , but the tree - level meson mixing became large , unless @xmath286 gets a mass larger than 10 tev .",

    "a value of @xmath316 associated with a new non - universal neutral gauge boson below the tev scale are almost incompatible , and in particular will rule out not only the 3 - 3 - 1 model with right - handed neutrinos , but also most of the 3 - 3 - 1 extensions of the sm . on the contrary , a value of @xmath325 in the range @xmath326 can coexist with a new non - universal neutral gauge boson at the tev scale , with strong predictions of rare top decays such as @xmath4 , with a branching ratio of the order of @xmath327 , perfectly reachable at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "fcnc produced by higgs scalar fields are not relevant for the 3 - 3 - 1 model with right - handed neutrinos . for the third family",
    "they do not exist at tree - level because the higgs field @xmath328 which couples to the third family , does not couple to the other two families .",
    "for the first two families the processes may exist , but they are negligible small and proportional to @xmath329 or to @xmath330 , where @xmath331 stands for the higgs scalar mass .",
    "finally , let us mention that in the context of the 3 - 3 - 1 model with right - handed neutrinos , no fcnc effects at tree - level are present in the lepton sector , due to the universality for leptons present in the weak basis .",
    "in order to explain the known hierarchy of the quark masses and mixing angles , several  ansatz \" for up and down quark mass matrices have been suggested in the literature  @xcite , some of them including the so - called texture zeros  @xcite . in particular , symmetric mass matrices with four and five texture zeros were studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , precision measurements of several entries in the mixing matrix , rule out most of the suggested simple structures .    in this appendix",
    "we are going to introduce what we have called the up - down approach which consists in fitting the data ( six quark masses and three mixing angles ) to a unitary @xmath1 mixing matrix , and then allow this matrix to loose its unitary character by letting the ordinary quarks to mix with the exotic ones .",
    "contrary to the approach used in the main text , this approach is characterized by the fact that @xmath316 .",
    "our numerical study suggest to start with the following hermitian , parallel , four texture zeros ansatz for the sm quark mass matrices @xmath332      where @xmath334 is a yukawa coupling constants fixed by the top quark mass .",
    "the former ansatz for up and down quark mass matrices has the extra ingredient of being compatible with a new kind of flavor symmetry and its perturbative breaking as proposed by froggatt and nielsen  @xcite , including a third order effect at the level of the bottom quark mass , implied by the entry @xmath335 .    to check the validity of our ansatz",
    "let us use a value of @xmath336 and @xmath337 gev in matrices ( [ uptex ] ) and ( [ dowtex ] ) which produce the following quark mass values in units of mev : @xmath338 @xmath339 numbers to be compared with the following values quoted from the second paper in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where they were calculates at the fermi scale @xmath340 , using the @xmath341 scheme ) : @xmath342      the consistency of our analysis shows up when we calculate the absolute values of @xmath347 which gives the following values @xmath348 which is an ( allmost ) unitary matrix , in agreement with the experimental constrains quoted in matrix ( [ maexp ] ) .    extending the previous analysis to the 3 - 3 - 1 model with right - handed neutrinos which includes four up type quarks and five down type quarks , we find that the maximall mixing allow of the ordinary quarks with the new ones , which does not violates the experimental values quoted in @xmath166 in matrix ( [ maexp ] ) , neither the quark mass values quoted above , preserving the allmost unitary character of ( [ mix0 ] ) , is given by        the @xmath128 rotation matrix which diagonalize the hermitian mass matrices @xmath192 in ( [ uptex4 ] )",
    "is now given by @xmath351 and the @xmath129 rotation matrix which diagonalize the hermitian mass matrices @xmath193 in ( [ dowtex5 ] ) is now given by        to finish , let us mention that from our @xmath1 mass matrices ( [ uptex ] ) and ( [ dowtex ] ) we can obtain at the end a @xmath163 mixing matrix depending only of a single phase .",
    "as a matter of fact , we have chosen allready three arbitrary phases in the up quark sector such that the mass matrix @xmath355 becomes real .",
    "then , two more phases can be eliminated from @xmath356 by a redefinition of the left - handed down quark fields , ending up with a single phase which propagates to @xmath357 .",
    "this single phase which shows up in a nonstandard parametrization of @xmath163 is the source of cp violation in the context of our ansatz .",
