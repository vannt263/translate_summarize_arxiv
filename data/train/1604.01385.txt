    "the quantum mechanics employed by physicists every day to make predictions concerning the outcomes of experimental measurements is not , as it is conventionally understood , sufficient to make predictions in physical situations in which a clearly defined concept of `` measurement '' is absent .",
    "prime examples of such physical situations may be found in the early universe , or indeed , any time or place in the universe where measuring ( recording ) apparatus are not present .",
    "how , then , may physical theories offer clear and unambiguous predictions concerning the behavior of the physical universe in the moments surrounding the epoch normally considered to be the big bang ?    one ( possibly partial ) answer to this question lies in the consistent ( or decoherent ) histories formulation of quantum theory pioneered and subsequently developed by griffiths @xcite , omnes @xcite , gell - mann and hartle @xcite , halliwell @xcite and others.@xcite in this framework quantum theory is supplemented by a _ consistency condition _ which must be satisfied in any specific physical situation in order for quantum theory to offer definite predictions concerning that situation .",
    "this condition amounts to the requirement that there is essentially no interference ( overlap ) between the branch wave functions corresponding to each of the alternative quantum histories describing that scenario . only in that case",
    "can quantum theory consistently assign definite probabilities to each of those possible alternative histories .",
    "this condition of `` decoherence '' or `` consistency '' among the branch wave functions is satisfied in any physical scenario that would normally be thought of as a classical `` measurement situation , '' and hence the framework of consistent histories encompasses the ordinary quantum mechanics of measurements  sans the additional hypothesis of `` collapse of the wave function '' upon measurement .",
    "however , it also extends it in an objective , observer - independent manner to a wide range of physical situations in which observers and measuring apparatus are not present , thus giving quantum theory a voice even when and where physicists themselves do not have one .",
    "the central mathematical object in the consistent histories framework is the _ decoherence functional_. it is a natural generalization of the notion of the quantum state of a system as it arises in the algebraic formulation of quantum theory , and is a sesquilinear functional of the possible quantum histories of the system .",
    "the decoherence functional measures the quantum interference between the possible histories , and , when that interference vanishes among all the possible histories ",
    "i.e.  the family of histories _ decoheres _ or `` is consistent ''  the probabilities of each of them . in this way",
    "the decoherence functional  the quantum state itself  provides definite quantum predictions for the behavior of a system even in the absence of observers , recording apparatus , or `` measurements . '' in this contribution we will summarize recent work on the application of these ideas to loop quantum cosmology , developed in collaboration with parampreet singh,@xcite and based on earlier work of j.b .",
    "hartle and others.@xcite all of the discussion will be formulated in the context of a flat , homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological model sourced by a massless , minimally coupled scalar field . in section [ sec : gqt ] we describe the consistent histories formalism in general terms .",
    "we then discuss in section [ sec : chqc ] the implementation of this formalism in both a conventional so - called `` wheeler - dewitt '' quantization of this cosmology , as well as a distinct _ loop _ quantization of the same model . in section [ sec : app ] we illustrate the application of this formalism to show how it may be used to make predictions concerning quantum histories of various physical quantities . as an important illustration , we show that in the wheeler - dewitt quantization , all quantum states are invariably singular , as they are in the classical theory .",
    "by contrast , in the loop quantization all quantum states remain non - singular , and indeed `` bounce '' from large volume to large volume , approaching well - defined states of the corresponding wheeler - dewitt quantization . in this way",
    "we illustrate how consistent histories formulations of quantum cosmological theories may be defined and then deployed to make consistent quantum predictions in these theories in the absence of the observers or measurements typically viewed as essential to prediction in quantum mechanics .",
    "a `` generalized quantum mechanics '' , as originally defined by hartle@xcite , consists in the specification of four ingredients : ( i ) the _ * fine - grained histories * _ @xmath0 of the system , the most refined descriptions of the possible alternative physical histories of the system it is possible to give . in lagrangian mechanics , for example , for a set of generalized coordinates @xmath1 , the fine - grained histories are all possible paths @xmath2 . the fine - grained histories may be collected into exhaustive ( complete ) sets of mutually exclusive alternative histories which we will sometimes denote by @xmath3 .",
    "depending upon the theory , there may be many distinct ( possibly incompatible ) such exclusive , exhaustive sets of histories , as happens for example in ordinary hilbert space quantum mechanics because of the existence of non - commuting operators .",
    "( explicit examples of histories in hilbert space quantum theory will be given below . )",
    "( ii ) the allowed _ * coarse - grainings * _ ( partitions ) of exclusive , exhaustive sets of alternative histories into more coarse - grained descriptions of the system . for example , in a diffeomorphism - invariant theory it would be typical to require coarse - grainings to be themselves diffeomorphism - invariant .",
    "( it is common to denote by @xmath4 a course - grained history that contains the history @xmath0 when it is convenient to refer back to @xmath0 specifically .",
    "it is also common to allow @xmath0 alone to represent both fine - grained and coarse - grained histories as is convenient in context . )",
    "it is assumed that all exclusive , exhaustive sets of fine - grained histories @xmath3 have a common complete coarse - graining @xmath5 .",
    "( iii ) the _ * decoherence functional * _ @xmath6 .",
    "the decoherence functional is a complex - valued function on pairs of histories that is    ( i ) : :    _ hermitian _ : @xmath7 ( ii ) : :    _ positive _ : @xmath8 ( iii ) : :    _ additive _ ( `` principle of superposition '' ) :    @xmath9 ( iv ) : :    _ normalized _ : @xmath10    note these conditions imply @xmath11 .",
    "finally , the decoherence functional is used to define ( iv ) the _ * decoherence condition * _ that determines when probabilities may be assigned to the histories in an exclusive , exhaustive set @xmath12 .",
    "the simplest and most common decoherence condition ( usually called `` medium decoherence '' in the literature@xcite ) simply requires that the decoherence functional be diagonal on a set of histories @xmath12 in order for probabilities to be assigned to the histories in @xmath12 . in that case",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath6 are the corresponding probabilities , and @xmath12 is said to be a _",
    "consistent _ or _ decoherent _ set of histories : @xmath13 if @xmath12 is a consistent set .",
    "only when @xmath12 is consistent may the diagonal elements of @xmath6 be interpreted as ( kolmogorov ) probabilities , for which @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( whence the term `` consistent histories '' . ) in particular , if decoherence does not obtain , the putative `` probabilities '' @xmath16 do not add consistently in the sense that @xmath17 , as happens for example in the two - slit experiment when the slit traversed is not measured .",
    "it is the consistency condition ( [ eq : dfndmtl ] ) that alone determines whether or not probabilities may be meaningfully assigned in any family of histories , and not any notion of `` observer '' or `` measurement '' ( though it does reproduce the predictions of ordinary copenhagan quantum theory when quantum measuring apparatus are included in the system . )",
    "it is an objective criterion that depends only on the system s quantum state and dynamics  and , of course , on the set of histories in question .    in ordinary hilbert space quantum theory ,",
    "fine - grained histories may be specified by sequences of eigenvalues @xmath18 of operators @xmath19 at a sequence of times @xmath20 : @xmath21 . is @xmath22 . in other words ,",
    "the _ superscript _ labels the _ observable _ , while the _ subscript _ labels the _ eigenvalues _ of that observable . ]",
    "corresponding to each history @xmath0 may be defined the operator @xmath23 where if @xmath24 is the theory s propagator , @xmath25 is a heisenberg picture projection operator .",
    "@xmath26 is called the `` class operator '' for the history @xmath0 , and is typically identified with @xmath0 itself .",
    "coarse - grainings of these histories then correspond to the operator sums @xmath27 corresponding to the history @xmath28 in which the value of @xmath29 is in the range @xmath30 labeled by @xmath31 ( so the spectrum of @xmath32 is the union of the intervals @xmath33 ) , and so on .",

    "if the intial state is pure , @xmath38 , this reduces simply to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the so - called `` branch wave function '' corresponding to the history @xmath0 . up to normalization , it is simply the wave function at time @xmath41 a system that began in the state @xmath42 would have were the system observed to have had values of observable @xmath29 in @xmath43 at time @xmath44 , @xmath45 in @xmath46 at time @xmath47 , and so on , i.e.  for the system to have been observed to `` follow '' the particular history @xmath0 .",
    "however , in consistent histories quantum theory we do _ not _ ( necessarily ) have observers as an essential element of the predictive scheme , and consequent wave function `` collapse '' . here , it appears simply as a description of one of the many possible alternative histories of the system , and it is up to decoherence to decide if the corresponding family of histories is consistent , and if so , what the probability of each such decohering history may be . , which is not strictly necessary ",
    "it cancels in the decoherence functional  and is introduced only in order to enable us to think of @xmath48 as an evolving solution of the schrdinger equation for all @xmath41 . ]",

    ". considerable further detail concerning the construction of the decoherence functional in theories whose amplitudes are defined by path integrals , both relativistic and non - relativistic , may be found in refs .  .",
    "in this way , in conjunction with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdefts ] ) , a consistent histories formulation may be given to spin foam models of quantum gravity@xcite and loop quantum cosmology,@xcite though we will not discuss these here .",
    "the process of making a physical prediction in this formulation of quantum theory proceeds as follows .",
    "given a quantum state @xmath42 and its associated decoherence functional , one constructs the class operators for the family of histories corresponding to the physical question in which one is interested  for example , what ( coarse - grained ) path does a quantum particle follow through a two - slit apparatus .",
    "the decoherence functional is then calculated to determine whether or not that family of histories decoheres i.e.  is consistent .",
    "if the family is consistent , the decoherence functional determines the probability of each history in the family , and the quantum question has been answered .",
    "however , if the family of histories is _ not _ consistent , then no probabilities can be assigned , and quantum mechanics says that the question being asked _ has no consistent answer within the theory .",
    "_ familiar examples are replete in ordinary quantum theory ",
    "e.g.  the precise values of the position and momentum of a particle at the same moment , or which slit a particle passed through in the two slit experiment if no information was gathered to determine it .",
    "this important point is perhaps worth some emphasis : the inability of quantum mechanics to make definite predictions concerning what are classically perfectly sensible physical statements is not in any way a unique feature of consistent histories quantum theory .",
    "what the consistent histories formulation provides is simply an _ observer - independent criterion _ , derived from the quantum state itself , for determining when that is the case , rather than relying on the copenhagen notion of a wave function - collapsing `` measurement '' , which is in any case impossible to make sense of in environments such as the early universe .",
    "we will see how this scheme works in quantum cosmology in the sequel .",
    "we consider what must be the simplest possible cosmological model , namely , a flat , homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker cosmology sourced by a single massless , minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "this model has two relevant advantages .",
    "first , it is simple enough that it admits two distinct , exactly solvable quantizations : a conventional `` wheeler - dewitt '' quantization , and a _ unitarily inequivalent _ loop quantization , the exactly solvable version of which is dubbed slqc .",
    "moreover , the loop quantization can be cast in the form of a spin - foam ( quasi-``path integral '' ) quantization of flat scalar flrw , with an explicitly solvable vertex expansion .",
    "it is thus a perfect playground within which to explore and contrast the consistent histories formulations of each of these three quantizations in a context in which mathematically explicit expressions and exact calculations are possible .",
    "second , in this model the scalar field emerges as an internal physical `` clock '' . while not essential to the consistent histories formulation , the presence of an internal clock variable does make it easier to conceptualize and interpret the results .",
    "thus , this model is rich enough to supply an exceptional proving ground for the exploration of the technical and conceptual issues associated with the consistent histories formulation of quantum gravitational models , in a technically manageable context .",
    "the flrw metrric for a homogeneous isotropic universe may be expressed as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the scale factor , @xmath60 is the lapse , and @xmath61 is a fixed , flat fiducial metric on the spatial slices @xmath62 , which we take to be topologically @xmath63.@xcite to construct a hamiltonian formulation of the dynamics spatial integrals over finite volumes are required .",
    "therefore , one introduces a fixed fiducial cell @xmath64 with volume @xmath65 relative to @xmath61 , the physical volume of which is therefore @xmath66 .",

    "the argument is once again based on the behavior of the eigenfunctions @xmath170 inserted into ( [ eq : lqcqwfdef ] ) .",
    "the uv cutoff in the eigenfunctions ensures that for * any * finite volume @xmath268 , _ all _ states in slqc vanish as @xmath276 , again on account of riemann - lebesgue .",
    "in addition , essentially because the eigenfunctions vanish at @xmath282 , the probability the volume of the fiducial cell is precisely 0 is 0 for _ all _ @xmath94 : @xmath283 .",
    "these universes never become singular for any value of @xmath94 .",
    "we have shown how , within a consistent histories framework , it may be demonstrated that the probability that the universe achieves zero volume is zero , while the probability that generic quantum states achieve arbitrarily large volume in both limits @xmath276 is unity : _ all _ quantum states in slqc `` bounce '' from large volume to large volume .",
    "by contrast , in the wheeler dewitt quantum theory , we showed that all right - moving ( expanding ) states inevitably assume zero volume as @xmath154 , and contracting states do so as @xmath284 , and are therefore singular .",
    "however , a _ superposition _ of expanding and contracting states leads to a probability for the universe having small volume that is in general never unity , just as it is never zero .",
    "this is suggestive that , in the wheeler - dewitt quantum theory , such a superposition state leads to a non - zero probability that it , too , might `` bounce '' from large volume to large volume ( with probability @xmath285 ) .",

    "so it is important to recognize that the question of whether or not a quantum universe bounces _ is not a question about a single value of @xmath94 _  it is a question about a coarse - grained _ * trajectory * _ : does the universe have a large volume at ( at least ) _ two _ values of @xmath94 , one in the `` past '' and one in the `` future '' ?",
    "this is a _ genuinely quantum _ question , and only has a definite quantum answer in the instance that the corresponding family of histories decoheres.@xcite we shall show , in fact , that in an appropriate limit it does , and that indeed loop quantum universes are generically non - singular and wheeler - dewitt universes are singular .    to pose the question concretely ,",

    "similarly , in loop quantum cosmology one finds instead that @xmath293 while @xmath294 again , these histories decohere , but now @xmath295 , and the probability arbitrary loop quantum states are singular is 0 .",
    "we have here reviewed the formulation of a consistent histories approach to quantum theory for loop quantum cosmology , showing how the framework provides the structure necessary  the decoherence functional  to enable the theory to make consistent quantum predictions in the absence of measurements , external observers , or other similar apparatus typically required in quantum theory before one can make definite predictions .",
    "we have illlustrated the application of the framework in showing how loop quantum cosmologies are non - singular for generic states , contrasting that striking result with the inevitable singularity of the wheeler - dewitt quantization of the same family of comological models .",
    "we have also made an effort to point to some other work on consistent histories formulations of quantum cosmological models , even though there was not sufficient space to review them here .",
    "discussion of a few important points is in order .",
    "it is no secret that while physicists generally agree on how to _ do _ quantum mechanics , the story is quite different when one has the temerity to inquire what it _ means_. we wish to emphasize that it is not necessary to commit to any particular ontology for quantum mechanics to acknowledge the centrality of the role of interference among alternative outcomes in arriving at quantum predictions . indeed ,",
    "destruction of this interference is the fundamental _ technical _ role played by the classical idea of `` measurement '' in quantum theory via the postulated `` collapse '' of the wave function upon measurement of a property by an external agent .",
    "consistent histories quantum theory supplies , more or less , the * minimal * additional structure one requires to provide quantum theory with an objective , observer independent , purely _ internal _ measure of this interference , that _ reproduces the predictions of ordinary measurement - based quantum theory _ in traditional `` measurement situations '' , but also _ extends it _ to physical circumstances in which there is no meaningful notion of an `` external observer '' , thus enabling quantum theory to make predictions concerning questions of fundamental physical interest such as in the early universe .",
    "in particular , we emphasize that apart from introducing the decoherence functional , the objective measure of interference derived from the quantum state ( an object already present in the conventional theory ) , consistent histories quantum theory _ is still quantum theory _ , with all of the interpretational challenges that implies .",
    "it is neither the place nor our intention here to analyze the limitations of the consistent histories framework as a complete answer to the question , `` what is the quantum mechanical account of reality ? ''",
    "it is our view that while the concepts of consistent histories  even supplemented by physical mechanisms and ideas such as environmental decoherence , envariance , and `` quantum darwinism''@xcite  are at best only a _ partial _ answer to this question , we nonetheless believe it likely they will play a role in an eventual picture .    we have just alluded to the fact that the consistent histories framework does not offer a fresh answer to the `` true '' meaning of the probabilities quantum theory supplies .",
    "nonetheless , we take it as uncontroversial that the meaning of a probability that is unity or zero is not ambiguous ",
    "the theory predicts that thing either does , or does not , happen , with certainty.@xcite these are the * definite * predictions of a theory .",
    "it is for this reason we have emphasized the @xmath276 limit in our assessment of the probabilities that wheeler - dewitt or loop quantum universes are ( or are not ) singular .",
    "it is in this limit that we are _ guaranteed _ that * all * wheeler - dewitt states are singular , and that * all * loop quantum states bounce , quasiclassical or not .    it may be natural to inquire whether one could have argued that wheeler - dewitt cosmologies are necessarily singular even for superposition states such as ( [ eq : psilrcatdef ] ) by arguing that the amplitude @xmath296 , without invoking the consistent histories formulation , and in spite of the fact that the `` single-@xmath94 '' probability illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : pvolplot ] suggests otherwise .",
    "( indeed , one finds such arguments in the classical literature on quantum cosmology.@xcite ) this is tempting , and is certainly the thrust of the consistent histories calculation itself .",
    "however , doing so _ assumes _ that this amplitude may be interpreted as a probability for a sequence of events , and thereby glosses over one of the fundamental messages of quantum theory : _ _ * quantum amplitudes do not represent quantum probabilities unless interference among the alternative outcomes vanishes . *",
    "_ _ simply put , quantum mechanics says that * some questions do not have physically meaningful answers . * in ordinary laboratory applications of quantum mechanics , the act of gathering information about a system  `` measurement ''  supplies the physical mechanisms that destroy that interference .",
    "amplitudes for outcomes which are measured do not interfere , and therefore may be interpreted as probabilities for those measured outcomes .",
    "if the measurement is not made , those amplitudes may * not * be consistently interpreted as probabilities for the unmeasured outcomes .",
    "the consistent histories perspective on quantum theory simply recognizes that amplitudes are not probabilities unless such interference vanishes , and supplies an objective measure of that interference that may be applied in the absence of laboratories and measurements in environments such as the very early universe , where there were certainly no observers present .",
    "even so , physical mechanisms may exist which destroy interfence among possible alternatives , and thereby enable quantum theory to assign definite probabilities to those alternatives .",
    "indeed , additional degrees of freedom may supply a resource which effectively `` gathers information '' ( i.e.  creates records@xcite ) about the physical alternatives of interest , leading to decoherence of those alternative histories and consequent ability to assign them meaningful probabilities .",
    "one would expect this to be the case in the actual physical universe which even in a globally homogeneous and isotropic cosmology carries both geometric and matter degrees of freedom which may imprint information about quantum alternatives and lead to decoherence .",
    "matter density perturbations in the early universe are just such degrees of freedom , and a consistent histories analysis of such perturbations should lead to a coherent picture of the `` quantum - to - classical '' transition of inflationary perturbations.@xcite    thus , the methods described in this review provide the tools to tell a consistent quantum story of the predictions of quantum gravitational theories in the early universe . in forthcoming work these methods will be applied to provide a similar analysis of spin - foam loop quantum cosmological models.@xcite",
