    "most of the known accreting compact objects emitting in the x - ray band , both in our and other galaxies , show large variations in their fluxes ( up to a factor of a few or even more in some cases ) over several decades in frequency .",
    "x - ray binaries , hosting neutron stars and black holes with masses between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are known to be variable on time scales ranging from milliseconds up to several days ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , on the other end of the mass spectrum , with masses in the range @xmath7 to @xmath8 , fluctuates on time scales ranging from a few minutes up to a few years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of this strong variability is currently not understood .    from the theoretical point of view , the main goal of variability studies is to understand the physical processes that modulate the emission of high - energy radiation and , in particular , how the fundamental properties of the central compact object ( mass , spin , surface or lack thereof ) determine the spectrum of observed frequencies . from the phenomenological point of view , observations provide a powerful tool for constraining mathematical models which , in turn , provide a guide in the investigation of physical models that can account for the observed variability . the studies carried out over the last decade with the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _",
    "( _ asca _ ) and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) and , more recently , with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and _ xmm - newton _  have revolutionized the timing phenomenology of both x - ray binaries and agn .    in the case of galactic sources , because of the typical timescales involved and thanks to the unprecedented timing capabilities of _ rxte _ , it has become possible to derive the power spectral density ( hereafter the power spectrum ) of a large number of accreting binaries with exquisite detail ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this made possible an important step forward toward understanding the similarities and differences exhibited in the power spectra of neutron stars and black holes @xcite    recently , it has become evident that the most salient timing features present in many x - ray binaries can be well described by a small number of lorentzians with different centroid frequencies , widths , and amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological framework has provided a solid ground for studying a number of tight correlations exhibited by the parameters characterizing the different lorentzian components .",
    "surprisingly , these correlations are not only present in any given source but are also maintained across sources ( both neutron stars and black holes ) over several decades in frequency space @xcite",
    ". some of these correlations might even be present in white - dwarf systems , extending the range of their validity to lower frequencies by two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the study , and eventual understanding , of these correlations offers one of the most promising avenues for constraining theoretical models of x - ray variability in accreting binaries .",
    "the lower observed fluxes and longer timescales associated with agn have not made possible a comparable progress in our understanding of their timing properties .",
    "both of these aspects affect the characterization of the power spectrum from the data at high and low frequencies , but also , through sampling effects , within the accessible frequency range . if there is significant variability below or above the lowest and/or highest frequencies probed by the observations , then the estimation of the power spectrum from the data suffers from the effects of red noise leakage and aliasing ( see , e.g. ,",

    "* ) .    in the last few years , however , it has become clear that agn power spectra do present characteristic frequencies ( `` breaks '' ) on the scale of hours to months @xcite .",
    "these frequencies have been linked to similar characteristic frequencies detected in early observations of a number of galactic black - hole candidates ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the similarities shared by the x - ray variability of agn and x - ray binaries extends beyond the overall shape of their power spectra .",
    "these similarities encompass a strong linear correlation between the rms variability amplitude and the x - ray flux , time scale - dependent lags between the hard and soft x - ray bands , and a similar energy - dependence of the power spectrum shape with higher energies showing flatter slopes above the frequency break ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the remarkable similarities shared by the global timing properties of objects with masses that differ so widely and the fact that the characteristic dynamical frequencies observed in agn seem to correlate with mass , has encouraged the use of x - ray variability as a mean for estimating supermassive black - holes masses .",
    "two different approaches are in use .    for the handful of agn",
    "for which there are good available data covering a long period of time , it is possible to identify one ( and in a few cases two ) characteristic frequency(ies ) in their power spectrum . assuming that the same characteristic frequency can be identified in a galactic black hole of known mass ( usually cyg x-1 ) and that the characteristic break frequency scales inversely with mass",
    ", the mass of several agn can be inferred @xcite .    as it is most often the case",
    ", however , the sparsity of the available data does not permit a reliable estimation of the power spectrum .",
    "in these cases , it is still possible to quantify the variability directly from the observed light curves by calculating the fractional rms variability amplitude ( or simply fractional rms ) , @xmath9 , i.e. , the square root of the variance of the light curve normalized by the mean flux over the period of observation after subtracting the experimental noise ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "obtaining variances from x - ray light curves is a much less intensive observational task than obtaining reliable power spectra . as a result",

    "* for a recent compilation of @xmath10 masses ) has allowed the study of correlations between @xmath1 and black - hole mass , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the fact that larger black holes are less variable for a given observation period suggests that the observed ( anti)correlation is partially due to a corresponding difference in the size of the x - ray emitting region .",
    "the fact that the fractional rms can be easily obtained from the observed x - ray light curves , and that the number of agn with measured variances is rapidly increasing , has motivated the theoretical modeling of the @xmath1-@xmath2 correlation . a fruitful approach to addressing this problem is to assume a functional form for the underlying power spectrum that depends on mass , @xmath11 , and calculate the square of the fractional rms that one would obtain when observing according to some sampling pattern , i.e. , @xmath12 . here , the set of values @xmath13 stands for the duration of the observation , the sampling interval , and the binning interval respectively .",

    "we consider model agn band - limited noise spectra that can be described as a sum of lorentzian components .",
    "this framework exposes ( and allows to explore further ) the underlying assumption often made when measuring agn masses by comparing their power spectra with those of x - ray binaries , i.e. , that the global timing properties of both systems simply `` scale '' with mass .",
    "an appealing feature of this framework is that it allows an analytical approach to account for the effects that the sampling pattern imprints on the observed power spectrum , facilitating the inclusion of sampling effects in theoretical models of the @xmath1-@xmath2 correlation .",

    "some of the mathematical details are presented in the appendices .    while writing this paper , we became aware of a calculation similar to the one that we present in ",
    "[ sec : sampling ] carried out by @xcite .",
    "their derivation accounts for sampling effects directly in the power spectrum as they would be present due to discrete sampling in a `` continuous '' monitoring campaign ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the derivation that we present here is more general and shows explicitly how the different processes which one subjects the light curve to ( i.e. , binning , sampling , and segmentation ) , affect the observed power spectrum for a sampling pattern characterized by the set of values @xmath13 . in this sense ,",
    "our derivation is more along the lines of @xcite , explicitly showing what happens to the real light curve in the process of obtaining the data .",
    "from the theoretical point of view , it is common to model and characterize the spectral content of a variable stochastic process by specifying the underlying ( or model ) power spectrum , @xmath16 , as a continuous function of the frequency @xmath17 .",
    "this spectrum can be thought of as associated with a process , @xmath18 , that varies over time in a continuous way . in the context of x - ray variability ,",

    "therefore , if we had unlimited access to the x - ray light curve , we could reconstruct the underlying power spectrum accurately for every frequency .    in practice , however , we do not have access to the continuous light curve , @xmath18 , but rather to a finite and discrete set of values @xmath19 that results from observing the source for a period of time @xmath20 every @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the inverse of the sampling rate and @xmath23 ( without loss of generality we will assume here that @xmath24 is even ) . in order to work with reasonably good signal - to - noise ratios ,",
    "the data are usually binned for an interval of time @xmath25 ( objects are said to be monitored `` continuously '' when @xmath26 ) . in what follows we will refer to the set of values @xmath27 as the `` sampling pattern '' .",
    "the finite and discrete nature of the observations not only dictates that we only have access to a finite and discrete set of values of the observed power spectrum , i.e. , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , but also that , through the effects of red noise leakage and aliasing @xcite , these values do not coincide with the values of the underlying ( model ) power spectrum at those frequencies ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) .",
    "moreover , because of the stochastic nature of the underlying process , the observed values @xmath28 differ , in general , from observation to observation . for a stationary process , however , the average taken over different observations ( with the same sampling pattern ) , is well defined and it can be used as a consistent estimator of the underlying power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the aim of this section is to find an equation that relates the continuous underlying power spectrum , @xmath16 , with the set of values @xmath32 obtained by averaging several observations with the same sampling pattern .",
