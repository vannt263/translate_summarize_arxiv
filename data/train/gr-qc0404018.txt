    "this section is divided into three parts . in the first",
    ", we outline the general , conceptual viewpoint that underlies loop quantum gravity ; in the second , we recall some of the central physical problems of quantum gravity ; and in the third , we summarize the progress that has been made in addressing these issues and sketch the organization of the paper .      in this approach , one takes the central lesson of general relativity seriously : gravity _ is _ geometry whence , in a fundamental theory , there should be no background metric . in quantum gravity , geometry and matter should _ both _ be ` born quantum mechanically ' .",
    "thus , in contrast to approaches developed by particle physicists , one does not begin with quantum matter on a background geometry and use perturbation theory to incorporate quantum effects of gravity .",
    "there _ is _ a manifold but no metric , or indeed any other fields , in the background . at the classical level , riemannian geometry provides the appropriate mathematical language to formulate the physical , kinematical notions as well as the final dynamical equations of modern gravitational theories .",
    "this role is now taken by _ quantum _",
    "riemannian geometry , discussed in sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] . in the classical domain , general relativity stands out as the best available theory of gravity , some of whose predictions have been tested to an amazing accuracy , surpassing even the legendary tests of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask : _ does quantum general relativity , coupled to suitable matter _ ( or supergravity , its supersymmetric generalization ) _ exist as a consistent theory non - perturbatively ? _    in the particle physics circles ,",
    "the answer is often assumed to be in the negative , not because there is concrete evidence against non - perturbative quantum gravity , but because of an analogy to the theory of weak interactions . there , one first had a 4-point interaction model due to fermi which works quite well at low energies but which fails to be renormalizable .",
    "progress occurred not by looking for non - perturbative formulations of the fermi model but by replacing the model with the glashow - salam - weinberg renormalizable theory of electro - weak interactions , in which the 4-point interaction is replaced by @xmath0 and @xmath1 propagators .",
    "it is often assumed that perturbative non - renormalizability of quantum general relativity points in a similar direction .",
    "however this argument overlooks the crucial fact that , in the case of general relativity , there is a qualitatively new element .",
    "perturbative treatments pre - suppose that space - time can be assumed to be a continuum _ at all scales _ of interest to physics under consideration .",
    "this appears to be a safe assumption in theories of electro - weak and strong interactions . in the gravitational case , on the other hand , the scale of interest is given by the planck length @xmath2 and there is no physical basis to _ pre - suppose _ that the continuum picture should be valid down to that scale .",
    "the failure of the standard perturbative treatments may be largely due to this grossly incorrect assumption and a non - perturbative treatment which correctly incorporates the physical micro - structure of geometry may well be free of these inconsistencies .",
    "note that , even if quantum general relativity did exist as a mathematically consistent theory , there is no a priori reason to assume that it would be the ` final ' theory of all known physics .",
    "in particular , as is the case with classical general relativity , while requirements of background independence and general covariance do restrict the form of interactions between gravity and matter fields and among matter fields themselves , the theory would not have a built - in principle which _ determines _ these interactions .",
    "put differently , such a theory would not be a satisfactory candidate for unification of all known forces .",
    "however , just as general relativity has had powerful implications in spite of this limitation in the classical domain , quantum general relativity should have qualitatively new predictions , pushing further the existing frontiers of physics .",
    "indeed , unification does not appear to be an essential criterion for usefulness of a theory even in other interactions .",
    "qcd , for example , is a powerful theory even though it does not unify strong interactions with electro - weak ones .",
    "furthermore , the fact that we do not yet have a viable candidate for the grand unified theory does not make qcd any less useful .",
    "finally , the quantum theory of geometry provides powerful tools to do quantum physics in absence of a background space - time .",
    "being kinematical , it is not rigidly tied to general relativity ( or supergravity ) and may well be useful also in other approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "approaches to quantum gravity face two types of issues : problems that are ` internal ' to individual approaches and problems that any approach must face .",
    "examples of the former are : incorporation of physical rather than half flat gravitational fields in twistor theory ; mechanisms for breaking of supersymmetry and dimensional reduction in string theory ; and issues of space - time covariance in the canonical approach . in this sub - section",
    ", we will focus on the second type of issues by recalling some of the long standing issues that _ any _ satisfactory quantum theory of gravity should address .",
    "@xmath3 _ big - bang and other singularities _ : it is widely believed that the prediction of a singularity , such as the big - bang of classical general relativity , is primarily a signal that the physical theory has been pushed beyond the domain of its validity .",
    "a key question to any quantum gravity theory , then , is : what replaces the big - bang ?",
    "are the classical geometry and the continuum picture only approximations , analogous to the ` mean ( magnetization ) field ' of ferro - magnets ?",
    "if so , what are the microscopic constituents ?",
    "what is the space - time analog of a heisenberg quantum model of a ferro - magnet ? when formulated in terms of these fundamental constituents , is the evolution of the _ quantum _ state of the universe free of singularities ?",
    "general relativity predicts that the space - time curvature must grow unboundedly as we approach the big - bang or the big - crunch but we expect the quantum effects , ignored by general relativity , to intervene , making quantum gravity indispensable before infinite curvatures are reached .",
    "if so , what is the upper bound on curvature ?",
    "how close to the singularity can we ` trust ' classical general relativity ?",
    "what can we say about the ` initial conditions ' , i.e. , the quantum state of geometry and matter that correctly describes the big - bang ?",
    "if they have to be imposed externally , is there a _ physical _ guiding principle ?",
    "@xmath3 _ black holes : _ in the early seventies , using imaginative thought experiments , bekenstein @xcite argued that black holes must carry an entropy proportional to their area .",
    "about the same time , bardeen , carter and hawking ( bch ) showed that black holes in equilibrium obey two basic laws , which have the same form as the zeroth and the first laws of thermodynamics , provided one equates the black hole surface gravity @xmath4 to some multiple of the temperature @xmath5 in thermodynamics and the horizon area @xmath6 to a corresponding multiple of the entropy @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , at first this similarity was thought to be only a formal analogy because the bch analysis was based on _ classical _ general relativity and simple dimensional considerations show that the proportionality factors must involve planck s constant @xmath8 .",
    "two years later , using quantum field theory on a black hole background space - time , hawking @xcite showed that black holes in fact radiate quantum mechanically as though they are black bodies at temperature @xmath9 . using the analogy with the first law , one",
    "can then conclude that the black hole entropy should be given by @xmath10 .",
    "this conclusion is striking and deep because it brings together the three pillars of fundamental physics general relativity , quantum theory and statistical mechanics .",
    "however , the argument itself is a rather hodge - podge mixture of classical and semi - classical ideas , reminiscent of the bohr theory of atom .",
    "a natural question then is : what is the analog of the more fundamental , pauli - schrdinger theory of the hydrogen atom ?",
    "more precisely , what is the statistical mechanical origin of black hole entropy ?",
    "what is the nature of a quantum black hole and what is the interplay between the quantum degrees of freedom responsible for entropy and the exterior curved geometry ?",
    "can one derive the hawking effect from first principles of quantum gravity ?",
    "is there an imprint of the classical singularity on the final quantum description , e.g. , through ` information loss ' ?",
    "@xmath3 _ planck scale physics and the low energy world : _ in general relativity , there is no background metric , no inert stage on which dynamics unfolds .",
    "geometry itself is dynamical .",
    "therefore , as indicated above , one expects that a fully satisfactory quantum gravity theory would also be free of a background space - time geometry .",
    "however , of necessity , a background independent description must use physical concepts and mathematical tools that are quite different from those of the familiar , low energy physics .",
    "a major challenge then is to show that this low energy description does arise from the pristine , planckian world in an appropriate sense , bridging the vast gap of some 16 orders of magnitude in the energy scale . in this",
    "` top - down ' approach , does the fundamental theory admit a ` sufficient number ' of semi - classical states ?",
    "do these semi - classical sectors provide enough of a background geometry to anchor low energy physics ? can one recover the familiar description ?",
    "furthermore , can one pin point why the standard ` bottom - up ' perturbative approach fails ?",
    "that is , what is the essential feature which makes the fundamental description mathematically coherent but is absent in the standard perturbative quantum gravity ?",
    "there are of course many more challenges : the issue of time , of measurement theory and the associated questions of interpretation of the quantum framework , the issue of diffeomorphism invariant observables and practical methods of computing their properties , practical methods of computing time evolution and s - matrices , exploration of the role of topology and topology change , etc etc .",
    "however , it is our view that the three issues discussed in detail are more basic from a physical viewpoint because they are rooted in general conceptual questions that are largely independent of the specific approach being pursued ; indeed they have been with us longer than any of the current leading approaches .      in recent years , a number of these fundamental physical issues were addressed in loop quantum gravity .",
    "these include : i ) a natural resolution of the big - bang singularity in homogeneous , isotropic quantum cosmology [ 103 - 117 ] ; ii ) a statistical mechanical derivation of the horizon entropy , encompassing astrophysically interesting black holes as well as cosmological horizons [ 122 - 141 ] ; and , iii ) the introduction of semi - classical techniques to make contact between the background independent , non - perturbative theory and the perturbative , low energy physics in minkowski space [ 142 - 160 ] .",
    "in addition , advances have been made on the mathematical physics front .",
    "in particular , these include : iv ) a demonstration that all riemannian geometric operators have discrete eigenvalues , implying that the space - time continuum is only an approximation [ 65 - 80 ] ; v ) a systematic formulation of quantum einstein equations in the canonical approach [ 85 - 102 ] ; and , vi ) the development of spin - foam models which provide background independent path integral formulations of quantum gravity [ 161 - 173 ] .",
    "these developments are also significant . for example , in contrast to v ) , quantum einstein s equations are yet to be given a precise mathematical meaning in quantum geometrodynamics a canonical approach that predates loop quantum gravity by two decades or so because the products of operators involved are divergent .",
    "all these advances spring from a detailed quantum theory of geometry that was systematically developed in the mid - nineties .",
    "this theory is , in turn , an outgrowth of two developments : a ) formulation of general relativity ( and supergravity ) as a dynamical theory of connections , with the same phase space as in yang - mills theories [ 12 - 16 ] ; and , b ) heuristic but highly influential treatments of quantum theories of connections in terms of loops [ 33 - 38 ] . in this review",
    ", we will first provide a brief but self - contained and pedagogical introduction to quantum geometry and then discuss its applications to problems mentioned above .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we recall connection formulations of general relativity .",
    "( readers who are primarily interested in quantum geometry rather than dynamical issues of general relativity may skip this section in the first reading . )",
    "the next four sections present the basics of quantum theory . in section [ s3 ] we summarize the overall strategy used in the construction of quantum kinematics ; in section [ s4 ] , we discuss background independent formulations of general quantum theories of connections ; in section [ s5 ] , the basics of quantum riemannian geometry and in section [ s6 ] the basics of quantum dynamics .",
    "these sections are self - contained and the reader is referred to the original papers only for certain proofs , technical subtleties and details that are interesting in their own right but not essential to follow the general approach .",
    "sections [ s7]-[s9 ] are devoted to applications of quantum geometry and a summary of current directions , where the treatment is less pedagogical : while the main ideas are spelled out , the reader will have to go through at least some of the original papers to get a thorough working knowledge .",
    "section [ s10 ] contains a summary and the outlook .    for simplicity ,",
    "most of the discussion in the main body of the review is focussed on the gravitational field .",
    "there is a large body of work on coupling of gauge , fermionic and scalar fields to gravity where the quantum nature of underlying geometry modifies the physics of matter fields in important ways .",
    "appendix [ a1 ] illustrates these issues using the einstein - maxwell theory as an example .",
    "appendix [ a2 ] contains a list of symbols which are frequently used in the review .    for a much more detailed review , at the level of a monograph , see , @xcite .",
    "less pedagogical overviews , at the level of plenary lectures in conferences , can be found in @xcite .",
    "general relativity is usually presented as a theory of metrics .",
    "however , it can also be recast as a dynamical theory of connections .",
    "such a reformulation brings general relativity closer to gauge theories which describe the other three fundamental forces of nature in the sense that , in the hamiltonian framework , all theories now share the same kinematics . the difference , of course , lies in dynamics . in particular , while dynamics of gauge theories of other interactions requires a background geometry , that of general relativity does not . nonetheless , by a suitable modification",
    ", one can adapt quantization techniques used in gauge theories to general relativity .",
    "we will see in sections [ s4],[s5 ] and [ s6 ] that this strategy enables one to resolve the functional analytic difficulties which have prevented ` geometrodynamical ' approaches to quantum gravity , based on metrics , to progress beyond a formal level .    in this section",
    ", we will present a self - contained introduction to connection formulations of general relativity .",
    "however , we will not follow a chronological approach but focus instead only on those aspects which are needed in subsequent sections . for a discussion of other issues ,",
    "see [ 2 , 12 - 23 ] .",
    "our conventions are as follows .",
    "@xmath11 will denote the 4-dimensional space - time manifold which we will assume to be topologically @xmath12 , equipped with a fixed orientation .",
    "for simplicity , in this section we will assume that @xmath13 is an oriented , compact 3-manifold without boundary .",
    "( modifications required to incorporate asymptotic flatness can be found in @xcite and those needed to allow an isolated horizon as an inner boundary can be found in @xcite . ) for tensor fields ( possibly with internal indices ) , we will use penrose s abstract index notation .",
    "the space - time metric will be denoted by @xmath14 and will have signature -,+,+,+ ( or , occasionally , + , + , + , + . in the lorentzian case , space - time",
    "will be assumed to be time - orientable . )",
    "the torsion - free derivative operator compatible with @xmath14 will be denoted by @xmath15 and its curvature tensors will be defined via @xmath16 } k_\\gamma$ ] ; @xmath17 ; and @xmath18 . for the tetrad formalism",
    ", we fix a 4-dimensional vector space @xmath19 equipped with a fixed metric @xmath20 of signature -,+,+,+ ( or + , + , + , + ) , which will serve as the ` internal space ' .",
    "orthonormal co - tetrads will be denoted by @xmath21 ; thus @xmath22 . in the passage to the hamiltonian theory ,",
    "the metric on a space - like cauchy surface @xmath23 will be denoted by @xmath24 and the spatial co - triads will be denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we will often set @xmath26 where @xmath27 is newton s constant .",
    "due to space limitation , we will focus just on the gravitational part of the action and phase space . for inclusion of matter , see e.g. , @xcite ; for extension to supergravity , see , e.g. , @xcite ; and for ideas on extension to higher dimensions , see @xcite .      in the palatini framework ,",
    "the basic gravitational variables constitute a pair @xmath28 of 1-form fields on @xmath11 taking values , respectively , in @xmath19 and in the lie algebra @xmath29 of the group @xmath30 of the linear transformations of @xmath19 preserving @xmath31 .",
    "because of our topological assumptions , the co - frame fields @xmath32 are defined globally ; they provide an isomorphism between @xmath33 and @xmath19 at each @xmath34 .",
    "the action is given by _",
    "( p)(e , )  =  _ _ ijkle^ie^j ^klwhere @xmath35 is an alternating tensor on @xmath19 compatible with @xmath31 such that the orientation of @xmath36 agrees with the one we fixed on @xmath13 and  : =  d+ , is the curvature of the connection 1-form @xmath37 .",
    "the co - frame @xmath38 determines a space - time metric @xmath39 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the more familiar einstein - hilbert action , @xmath40 depends on an additional variable , the connection @xmath41 .",
    "however , the equation of motion obtained by varying the action with respect to the connection implies that @xmath41 is in fact completely determined by the co - frame : de + e  =  0.[de ] if we now restrict ourselves to histories on which the connection is so determined , @xmath40 reduces to the familiar einstein - hilbert action : _ ( p)(e,(e ) )  =   _ d^4x r .",
    "where @xmath42 is the scalar curvature of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the equation of motion for the metric is the same as that of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the action @xmath40 is invariant under diffeomorphisms of @xmath11 as well as _ local _ @xmath30 transformations ( e , ) ( e, )  =  ( b^-1e , b^-1b + b^-1db ) .[rotations]it is straightforward but rather tedious to perform a legendre transform of this action and pass to a hamiltonian theory @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the theory has certain second class constraints and , when they are solved , one is led to a triad version of the standard hamiltonian theory of geometrodynamics ; all reference to connection - dynamics is lost .",
    "this can be remedied using the following observation : there exists another invariant , constructed from the pair @xmath43 , with the remarkable property that its addition to the action does not change equations of motion .",
    "the modified action , discussed by holst @xcite , is given by : _",
    "( h)(e , )  =  * s*_(p)(e , ) - _ e^ie^j_ij [ holst]where @xmath44 is an arbitrary but fixed number , called the _ barbero - immirzi _ parameter . for applications to quantum theory ,",
    "it is important to note that _ @xmath44 can not be zero . _",
    "the purpose of this section is to analyze this action and the hamiltonian theory emerging from it . in sections [ s2.2 ] and [ s2.3 ]",
    "we will show that the hamiltonian theory can be naturally interpreted as a background independent , dynamical theory of connections .",
    "recall that , in yang - mills theories , one can also add a ` topological term ' to the action which does not change the classical equations of motion because its integrand can be re - expressed as an exterior derivative of a three - form . in the present case , while the extra term is not of topological origin , because of the first bianchi identity it vanishes identically on histories on which ( [ de ] ) holds .",
    "therefore the situation is similar in the two theories in some respects : in both cases , the addition of the term does not change the classical equations of motion and it induces a canonical transformation on the classical phase space which fails to be unitarily implementable in the quantum theory .",
    "consequently , the parameter @xmath44 is in many ways analogous to the well - known @xmath45 parameter in the yang - mills theory @xcite . just as the quantum theory has _",
    "@xmath45-sectors in the yang - mills case , it has _ inequivalent _",
    "@xmath44-sectors in the gravitational case .",
    "we will conclude this preliminary discussion by exhibiting the symplectic structure in the covariant phase space formulation . here",
    "the phase space @xmath46 is taken to be the space of ( suitably regular ) solutions to the field equations on @xmath11 . to define the symplectic structure ,",
    "one follows the following general procedure .",
    "denote by @xmath47 tangent vectors in the space of histories .",
    "since field equations are satisfied on @xmath46 , the change in the lagrangian 4-form @xmath48 under a variation along @xmath49 is for the form @xmath50 for some 3-form @xmath51 on @xmath11 which depends linearly on @xmath49 .",
    "one can now define a 1-form @xmath52 on the space of histories via : @xmath53 .",
    "the symplectic structure @xmath54 is simply the pull - back to @xmath46 of the curl of @xmath52 on the space of histories . in our case , @xmath55 is given by @xmath56.\\ ] ] whence the symplectic structure is given by : ( _ 1,_2 )  = - _ [ symp]for all tangent vectors @xmath57 and @xmath58 to @xmath46 . from general considerations",
    ", it follows that the value of the integral is independent of the specific choice of a cauchy surface @xmath13 made in its evaluation .",
    "using the fact that the tangent vectors to @xmath46 must , in particular , satisfy the linearized version of ( [ de ] ) it is easy to verify that the @xmath44-dependent term in ( [ symp ] ) vanishes identically : not only is @xmath46 independent of the value of @xmath44 ( see footnote 5 ) but so is the symplectic structure @xmath54 on it . as is clear from ( [ symp ] ) , the momentum conjugate to @xmath59 , on the other hand , does depend on the choice of @xmath44 .",
    "thus , as noted above , like the @xmath45 term in the yang - mills theory , the @xmath44 term in ( [ holst ] ) only induces a canonical transformation on the phase space .    in effect",
    "the canonical transformation is induced by the map @xmath60 on @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to verify that this map is a vector space isomorphism on @xmath29 except when @xmath61 the sign of the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath31 . , the equation of motion for the connection resulting from variation of @xmath62 with respect to @xmath41 is again ( [ de ] ) .",
    "hence the space of solutions obtained by varying @xmath63 is the same as that obtained by varying @xmath40 . for the exceptional values",
    ", this equation says that the ( anti- ) self dual part of @xmath41 equals the ( anti- ) self dual part of the connection compatible with the co - frame @xmath38 .",
    "however , it is again true that the spaces of solutions obtained by extremizing @xmath62 and @xmath40 are the same @xcite . ] at these exceptional values of @xmath44 , the map is a projection onto the subspace of @xmath64 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath65 of the hodge - dual operator @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , in this case the map is a _ lie algebra homomorphism_. in the riemannian case ( when @xmath67 has signature + , + , + , + ) this occurs for @xmath68 while in the lorentzian case ( when @xmath67 has signature -,+,+,+ ) it occurs for @xmath69 . in all these exceptional cases",
    "the theory has a richer geometrical structure .",
    "in particular , the combination @xmath70 that occurs in the symplectic structure is again a ( half - flat ) connection .",
    "chronologically , the background independent approach to quantum gravity summarized in this review originated from a reformulation of general relativity in terms of these half - flat connections @xcite .",
    "it turns out that all equations in the classical theory simplify considerably and underlying structures become more transparent in these variables .",
    "they are also closely related to penrose s non - linear gravitons @xcite and newman s h - space constructions @xcite . in the riemannian signature",
    ", one can continue to use these variables also in the quantum theory . in the lorentzian case , on the other hand",
    ", the half - flat connections take values in the lie algebra of non - compact groups and functional analysis on spaces of such connections is still not sufficiently well - developed to carry out constructions required in the quantum theory .",
    "therefore , in the lorentzian case , most progress has occurred by working in sectors with real values of @xmath44 where , as we will see , one can work connections with compact structure groups .    in section [ s2.2 ]",
    "we will summarize the situation with half - flat connections in the riemannian case and in section [ s2.3 ] we will discuss the lorentzian theory using real valued @xmath44 sectors .",
    "let us then assume that @xmath31 is positive definite .",
    "since @xmath71 , the half flat case corresponds to setting @xmath72 .",
    "let us set ^(+)_ij  =  ( _ ij - _ ij^kl_kl ) so that @xmath73 is the anti - self dual part of @xmath74 if @xmath75 and self dual , if @xmath76 . in these cases , the holst action simplifies to : _",
    "( h)(e , ^(+ ) )  = -__(+)^ij^(+)_ij where @xmath77 is the ( anti-)self dual part of @xmath59 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 is both the ( anti-)self dual part of @xmath80 _ and _ the curvature of @xmath81 : @xmath82 _ note that the theory under consideration is full ( riemannian ) general relativity _ ; we are just describing it in terms of the fields @xmath83 where @xmath81 is a half flat ( i.e. , self dual or anti - self dual ) connection .",

    "1-form @xmath89 on @xmath13 , the 3-form @xmath90 is a volume element on @xmath13 which is independent of the choice of coordinates @xmath91 . ]",
    "let us introduce on @xmath11 a smooth ( ` time ' ) function @xmath92 such that @xmath93 is everywhere non - zero and each @xmath94 slice is diffeomorphic with @xmath13 .",
    "introduce a vector field @xmath95 such that @xmath96 .",
    "thus , @xmath95 is to be thought of as the ` time - evolution vector field ' .",
    "denote by @xmath97 the unit normal to the @xmath94 slices @xmath13 and decompose @xmath95 as @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",

    ", it is now straightforward to perform the legendre transform .",
    "the calculation is remarkably short ( especially when compared to the legendre transform in the metric variables ; see , e.g. page 47 of @xcite ) . in terms of fields @xmath107 and @xmath87 introduced above , one obtains . ] : [ lt1 ] * s*_(h ) = dt_m d^3x ( p^a_ij l_t a_a^ij - h_(+)(a , p , n ,",

    "the form of ( [ h+ ] ) confirms that , as suggested by ( [ sympl2 ] ) , we should regard @xmath107 as the configuration variable and @xmath87 as its momentum .",
    "the momentum is related in a simple way to the 3-metric : @xmath113 note that @xmath114 and @xmath115 are lagrange multipliers ; there are no equations governing them .",
    "the basic dynamical variables are only @xmath107 and @xmath87 ; all other dynamical fields are determined by them .",
    "variation of @xmath62 with respect to these multipliers yields constraints : g_ij  = 0;c_a^(+ )  = 0 ; c^(+ )  = 0 .",
    "as is always the case ( in the spatially compact context ) for theories without background fields the hamiltonian is a sum of constraints .",
    "variations of the action with respect to @xmath107 and @xmath87 yield the equations of motion for these basic dynamical fields .",

    "we wish to emphasize two important points .",
    "first , note that in the hamiltonian theory we simply begin with the fields @xmath167 ; neither they nor their poisson brackets depend on the barbero - immerzi parameter @xmath44 .",

    "@xmath44 appears only when we express geometrical fields the spatial triad @xmath171 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath150 in terms of the basic canonical variables ( see ( [ p ] ) and ( [ k ] ) ) .",
    "the second point concerns a conceptual difference between the use of half flat and general connections .",
    "the configuration variables in both cases are connections on @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , as noted in section [ s2.3.1 ] , the relation ( [ pa ] ) between these connections and the fields @xmath172 is identical in form . however , while the variable @xmath107 of section [ s2.2 ] is the pull - back to @xmath13 of a _ space - time _",
    "connection @xmath173 , the variable @xmath151 now under consideration is not so obtained @xcite . from the space - time geometry perspective , therefore , @xmath151 is less natural .",

    "\\3 . throughout this section",
    "we have assumed that the frames , co - frames and metrics under consideration are non - degenerate .",
    "however , the final hamiltonian framework can be naturally extended to allow degenerate situations .",
    "specifically , by replacing the scalar lapse function @xmath100 with one of density weight @xmath185 , one can allow for the possibility that the fields @xmath152 become degenerate , i.e. , have @xmath186 .",

    "although individual steps in the construction are straightforward , the motivation , the goals , and the relation to procedures used in standard quantum field theories may not always be transparent to an uninitiated reader .",

    "let us examine this issue further .",
    "any one cylindrical function is a ` fake ' infinite dimensional function in the sense that its ` true ' dependence is only on a finite number of variables .",
    "however , in the cauchy completion , we obtain states which ` genuinely ' depend on an infinite number of degrees of freedom",
    ". however , in general , these states can not be realized as functions on @xmath187 . in the case of free fields ,",
    "the appropriate measures are gaussians ( with zero mean and variance determined by the operator @xmath212 ) and all quantum states can be realized as functions on the space @xmath213 of tempered distributions , the topological dual of the space @xmath191 of probes .",
    "in fact , the cylindrical measure can be extended to a regular borel measure @xmath208 on @xmath213 and the hilbert space is given by @xmath214 .",

    "we saw in section [ s2 ] that general relativity can be recast in such a way that the configuration variables are @xmath184 connections on a ` spatial ' manifold @xmath13 . in this section",

    "hence , our first task is to introduce a set of probes to extract a finite number of degrees of freedom from the connection field .",
    "the new element is gauge invariance : now the probes have to be well adapted to extracting gauge invariant information from connections .",

    "since these basic excitations are 1-dimensional , the quantum geometry is said to be _ polymer - like_. if the graph has just a few edges , we have a highly quantum mechanical state the analog of a state of the quantum maxwell field with just a few photons . to approximate a classical geometry",
    ", one needs a _ highly _ excited state , with a huge number of edges , cris - crossing @xmath13 ` very densely ' .",
    "let us summarize our discussion of quantum kinematics for background independent theories of connections . in section [ s4.3.1 ]",
    ", we introduced a lie algebra of holonomy and flux functions on the classical phase space @xcite .",
    "in the subsequent sub - sections , we constructed a natural , diffeomorphism covariant representation of the quantum analog of this holonomy - flux algebra . for pedagogical reasons , we chose a constructive approach and developed the theory step by step starting from quantum mechanics on a compact lie algebra @xmath27 and passing through the quantum theory of connections on graphs .",
    "the actual development of the subject , on the other hand , began with a broader perspective and first principles @xcite ) .",
    "the main problem is that of finding the physically appropriate representation of the holonomy - flux algebra .",
    "the starting point was the observation @xcite that @xmath203 , which serves as the algebra of configuration variables , has the structure of an abelian @xmath489-algebra . by completing it in the sup - norm one obtains the @xmath490 algebra @xmath491 of quantum configuration operators .",
    "the strategy was to first seek its representations and then represent the momentum operators on the resulting hilbert spaces . a general theorem due to gelfand ensures that _ every _ representation of @xmath491 is of the following type : the hilbert space is the space of square - integrable functions on a compact hausdorff space called the gelfand spectrum of the @xmath490-algebra with respect to a regular borel measure , and the configuration operators act on it by multiplication .",
    "the non - trivial fact is that the structure of @xmath203 is such that the spectrum is easy to exhibit : it is precisely our space @xmath227 @xcite .",
    "thus , the representation of the algebra of elementary variables we constructed step by step is in fact rooted in the general gelfand representation theory .    even though this procedure is quite general and well - motivated ,",
    "one can nonetheless ask why we did not adopt the more general algebraic approach but focused instead on a specific representation .",
    "interestingly , several partial uniqueness theorems have been established indicating that the requirement of general covariance suffices to select a unique cyclic representation of the kinematic quantum algebra @xcite .",
    "this is the quantum geometry analog to the seminal results by segal and others that characterized the fock vacuum in minkowskian field theories .",
    "however , while that result assumed not only poincar invariance but also specific ( namely free ) dynamics , it is striking that the present uniqueness theorems make no such restriction on dynamics .",
    "thus , the quantum geometry framework is surprisingly tight .",
    "these results seem to suggest that , for background independent theories , the full generality of the algebraic approach may be unnecessary : if there is a unique diffeomorphism invariant representation , one might as well restrict oneself to it .",
    "for non - trivially constrained systems such as general relativity , this is fortunate because a satisfactory and manageable algebraic treatment of theories with such constraints is yet to become available .",
    "in this section , we will introduce simple geometric operators on @xmath209 . recall from section [ s2 ] that the internal group for the phase space of general relativity is @xmath184 and the riemannian geometry",
    "is coded in the triad field @xmath492 ( of density weight one ) , where @xmath493 is the barbero - immirzi parameter ( see ( [ p ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the quantum theory we set @xmath228 and our geometric operators are built from the ( smeared ) triad operators @xmath494 .",
    "because of space limitation , we will only discuss the area and the volume operators [ 65 - 78 ] which have had direct applications , e.g. , in the entropy calculations and quantum dynamics .",
    "for the length operator , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath7 be either a closed 2-dimensional sub - manifold of @xmath13 or an open 2-dimensional sub - manifold without boundary . in the classical theory ,",
    "its area is a function on the phase space given by @xmath495 , where @xmath161 is the determinant of the intrinsic 2-metric @xmath496 on @xmath7 .",
    "our task is to construct the quantum operator corresponding to this phase space function and analyze its properties .",
    "( for further details , see @xcite ) .",
    "a natural strategy is to first re - express @xmath497 in terms of the ` elementary ' observables @xmath498 , and then replace each @xmath499 by its unambiguous quantum analog .",
    "this strategy naturally leads to a regularization procedure which we now summarize .",
    "let us divide @xmath7 in to a large number of elementary cells , @xmath500 , with @xmath501 .",
    "on each cell , introduce an internal triad @xmath231 and , using its elements as test fields @xmath452 , set @xmath502 .",
    "next , recall from ( [ p ] ) that the orthonormal triad @xmath503 of density weight one is related to the momentum field @xmath152 via @xmath504 . set _",

    "then , we first define an approximate area operator by first noting that , for each @xmath507 , @xmath510 is a positive definite self - adjoint operator on @xmath209 with a well - defined ( positive ) square - root , and setting [ approxahat ] [ _ s]_n : = 8g_i=1^n . to obtain an explicit expression of this operator ,",
    "let us restrict its action to hilbert space @xmath316 associated with any one graph @xmath195 .",
    "let us first refine the partition sufficiently so that every elementary cell @xmath500 intersects @xmath195 transversely at most at one point ( or contains a segment of @xmath195 ) . then , using the expression ( [ esf1 ] ) of the smeared triad operators , we conclude that a non - zero contribution to the sum in ( [ approxahat ] ) comes only from those @xmath500 which intersect @xmath195 and , furthermore , a subsequent refinement of the partition does not change the result .",
    "thus , for any given @xmath195 , the limit @xmath511 is reached already at a finite step ; somewhat surprisingly , the removal of the regulator can be achieved rather easily in the quantum theory .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the resulting operator @xmath512 is given by : [ hata]_s , = 4 ^ 2 _ v .",

    "( the ` up ' and ` down ' operators @xmath457 and @xmath514 are defined in ( [ esf2 ] ) . )",
    "thus , on each @xmath316 we have obtained a non - negative , self - adjoint area operator @xmath515 .",
    "the question is if these operators can be glued together to obtain a well - defined area operator on the full hilbert space @xmath209 . as in the definition of measures on @xmath227 ,",
    "this is a question about _ consistency _ of the family .",
    "more precisely , suppose an element @xmath190 of @xmath203 belongs both to @xmath516 and @xmath517 , for two different graphs @xmath405 and @xmath406 . the question is whether @xmath518 equals @xmath519 as an element of @xmath203 .",
    "the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "thus , there is a non - negative , self - adjoint operator @xmath520 on @xmath209 whose restriction to @xmath200 is given by ( [ hata ] ) for any graph @xmath195 .",
    "in fact , we can also define an _ area element operator _ corresponding to @xmath521 whose integral over @xmath7 gives the total area operator @xmath522 .",

    "shrinking the coordinate size of the cells uniformly , @xmath526 tends to @xmath521 .",
    "as before , we can pass to a regularized quantum operator = simply by replacing the smeared @xmath363 s with corresponding operators .",
    "finally , we remove the regulator .",
    "the result is a well - defined operator - valued distribution on @xmath209 , whose action on @xmath200 is given by : = 4 ^ 2 _ v ^2_(s)(x , v ) .",
    "where @xmath527 is the 2-dimensional dirac distribution on @xmath7 and the sum is over intersections @xmath323 of @xmath195 and @xmath7 .",
    "again , this family of operators is consistent and therefore defines an operator @xmath528 on @xmath209 .",
    "_ remark _ : in the definition of the momentum operators @xmath529 and area operators @xmath520 , we only considered 2-manifolds @xmath7 without boundary .",

    "one is led to assign a quantum area operator @xmath536 also to a point @xmath323 of @xmath7 .",

    "the eigenvalues of the operator are given by finite sums [ as ] a_s  =   4 ^ 2 _ i , where @xmath541 are arbitrary eigenvalues of the operators @xmath542 .",
    "now , this operator can be cast in a convenient form as a sum of three commuting operators , -_s , v  =  2(^(d)_s , v)^2 + 2(^(u)_s , v)^2 - ( ^(u)_s , v + ^(d)_s , v)^2 , which makes its eigenvalues transparent .",

    "thus , all eigenvalues are discrete and the area gap the smallest non - zero eigenvalue @xmath545 is given by",

    "this implies that , although the eigenvalues _ are _ fundamentally discrete , the continuum approximation becomes excellent _ very rapidly_. on the full kinematic hilbert space @xmath209 as opposed to the gauge invariant sub - space considered below all these properties are insensitive to the topology of @xmath7 .",

    ", quantum connection - dynamics is very ` tight ' ; once we choose the holonomies @xmath368 and the ` electric fluxes ' @xmath369 as basic variables , there is essentially no freedom in the background independent quantization .",

    "furthermore , at gauge invariant 4-valent vertices , @xmath617 agrees with @xmath601 , _ modulo _ a multiplicative factor which depends on the diffeomorphism class of the tangent vectors at @xmath323 . in spite of this close relation on simple states ,",
    "the two operators are fundamentally different because of the absence of the orientation factor @xmath618 in ( [ extvol ] ) .",
    "in particular , because of this factor , the operators constructed in section [ s5.2.1 ] know about the differential structure at vertices of graphs . by contrast , the action of ( [ extvol ] ) is ` topological ' .    in the literature ,",
    "internally regulated operators of section [ s5.2.1 ] are used more often .",
    "for example , thiemann s analysis of properties volume operators in the continuum @xcite and loll s analysis on lattices @xcite refer to ( [ vol1 ] ) .",
    "the same is true of the volume operators used by thiemann and others in the discussion of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the quantum geometry framework provides the appropriate arena for a precise formulation of quantum einstein s equations . as indicated in section [ s2 ] , because of the difficult problems of background independent regularization of products of operator valued distributions , quantum einstein s equations still remain formal in geometrodynamics . in connection - dynamics , by contrast , we have a well - defined hilbert space @xmath209 of kinematical states and it is natural to attempt to represent left sides of quantum einstein s equations by well - defined operators on @xmath209 .",
    "now , in interacting ( low dimensional ) quantum field theories , there is a delicate relation between quantum kinematics and dynamics : unless the representation of the basic operator algebra is chosen appropriately , typically , the hamiltonian fails to be well - defined on the hilbert space . for a complicated system such as general relativity ,",
    "then , one would imagine that the problem of choosing the ` correct ' kinematic representation would be extremely difficult ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , a major simplification arises from the striking uniqueness result discussed at the end of section [ s4 ] : the requirement of general covariance picks out a unique representation of the algebra generated by holonomies and electric fluxes @xcite .",

    "let us now consider the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "we will find that the imposition of this constraint is more complicated because of a key difference : while there is an infinite dimensional subspace @xmath628 of @xmath209 that is invariant under the @xmath184 gauge rotations , since diffeomorphisms move graphs , the only element of @xmath209 left invariant by the action of all diffeomorphisms is the constant function on @xmath227 ! as a result , solutions to the quantum constraints lie not in the kinematical hilbert space @xmath209 but in a larger space , the dual @xmath487 of @xmath203 .",

    "finally there is an important technical subtlety coming from the fact that , graphs @xmath195 are required to have closed - piecewise analytic edges .",
    "the classical phase space , on the other hand , consists of smooth ( i.e. @xmath398 ) fields @xmath649 . smooth diffeomorphisms @xmath638 correspond to finite canonical transformations generated by the constraint ( [ diff ] ) and have a well - defined action on the phase space .",
    "it is just that the action does not extend to our full algebra of ` elementary variables ' since their definition involves closed - piecewise analytic edges and surfaces .",
    "a natural strategy to impose the diffeomorphism constraint , therefore , is to enlarge the framework and allow smooth edges and surfaces .",
    "this is possible @xcite but then the technical discussion becomes much more complicated because , e.g. , two smooth curves can intersect one another at an infinite number of points . here we will adopt an ` in - between ' approach and use the sub - group @xmath650 of all @xmath398 diffeomorphisms of @xmath13 , introduced in section [ s4.3.5 ] , which has a well - defined action on our elementary variables and the hilbert space @xmath209 . from a physical perspective",
    ", this is more appropriate than averaging with respect to just the analytical diffeomorphisms and from a mathematical perspective it enables us to bypass the complications associated with non - analytical edges and surfaces .",
    "our task now is to construct the general solution to the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "for this , we will use the spin - network decomposition ( [ snd ] ) : @xmath651 .",
    "let us begin by introducing some notation . given a graph @xmath195 , denote by @xmath652 the sub - group of @xmath650 which maps @xmath195 to itself and by @xmath653 its subgroup which has trivial action on @xmath195 , i.e. , which preserves every edge of @xmath195 and its orientation .",

    ", we proceed in two steps .",
    "first , given any @xmath657 , we average it using _ only the group of graph symmetries _ and obtain a projection map @xmath658 from @xmath659 to its subspace which is invariant under @xmath660 : _ , _  : =   _ _ _ , where @xmath661 is the number of the elements of @xmath662 ( the volume of the obit of @xmath663 ) and @xmath664 denotes the pull - back of @xmath199 under @xmath638 .",
    "the map extends naturally to a projection @xmath665 from @xmath666 to its subspace which is invariant under @xmath656 for all @xmath195 .    in the second step ,",
    "we wish to average with respect to the remaining diffeomorphisms _ which move the graph @xmath195_. this is a very large group and the result of averaging now belongs to @xmath487 rather than @xmath209 .",
    "thus , to each @xmath667 , we now associate an element @xmath668 , defined by its ( linear ) action on arbitrary cylindrical functions @xmath669 : [ av ] ( ( _ ) | _  = _ /diff _ _ , _ , _ , where the bracket on the right side denotes the inner product between elements of @xmath209 . although @xmath670 contains an infinite number of elements @xmath638 , for any given @xmath206 only a finite number of terms",
    "are non - zero , whence @xmath671 is well - defined . however , there is no vector @xmath672 in @xmath209 such that @xmath673 equals the right side of ( [ av ] ) for all @xmath674 .",
    "thus , @xmath675 is a ` genuine distribution ' on @xmath227 rather than a function .",
    "because of the diffeomorphism invariance of the scalar product on @xmath209 , @xmath676 is invariant under the action of @xmath677 : ( ( _ ) | _  = ( ( _ ) | _ for all @xmath678 . we will denote the space of these solutions to the diffeomorphism constraint by @xmath679 . finally ,",
    "since @xmath680 was an arbitrary element of @xmath203 , we have constructed a map : : ^_. thus , _ every _ element of @xmath203 gives rise , upon group averaging , to a solution to the diffeomorphism constraint . in this sense , we have obtained the general solution to the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "the map @xmath672 is the analog of the projection from @xmath209 to its gauge invariant sub - space @xmath628 in the case of the gauss constraint .",
    "however , because of the differences between the two constraints discussed above , @xmath672 is _ not _ a projection since it maps @xmath203 onto a _ different _",

    "( for subtleties , see @xcite ) .",
    "we will denote by @xmath681 the cauchy completion of @xmath679 .",
    "finally , we can obtain the _ general solution to both the gauss and the diffeomorphism constraints _ by simply restricting the initial @xmath682 to be gauge invariant , i.e. , to belong to @xmath683 .",
    "we will denote this space of solutions by @xmath684 : ^_= ( ^g _ ) what is the situation with respect to operators ?",
    "note first that there do exist non - trivial ( gauge and ) diffeomorphism invariant operators on @xmath203 ; an example is the total volume operator @xmath595 .",

    "the operator @xmath686 is self adjoint with respect to the natural scalar product ( [ ip3 ] ) on @xmath681 if and only if @xmath685 is self adjoint in @xmath209 .",

    "let us summarize .",
    "the basic idea of the procedure used to solve the diffeomorphism constraint is rather simple : one averages the kinematical states with the action of the diffeomorphism group to obtain physical states .",
    "but the fact that this procedure can be implemented in detail is quite non - trivial .",
    "for example , a mathematically precise implementation still eludes the geometrodynamics program .",
    "furthermore , even the final answer contains certain subtleties .",
    "we will conclude by pointing them out .",
    "_ remarks : _",
    "i ) note that while @xmath688 is a solution to the diffeomorphism constraint for any @xmath682 , it is _ not _ true that there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between elements of @xmath203 and solutions to the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "this is because the map @xmath672 has a non - trivial kernel . in particular , the projection map @xmath689 itself has a non - trivial kernel which , by ( [ av ] ) is also in the kernel of @xmath672 .",
    "( in addition , elements of @xmath203 of the form @xmath690 are also in the kernel of @xmath672 . ) therefore statements such as `` solutions to the diffeomorphism constraint are diffeomorphism classes of spin network states '' that one often finds in the literature are only heuristic .",
    "+ ii ) one also finds claims to the effect that the diffeomorphism constraint can be imposed simply by replacing spin networks embedded in a manifold @xmath23 by abstract , non - embedded spin networks . within the systematic approach summarized in this section ,",
    "these claims are simply incorrect ( for a detailed discussion in the context of 2 + 1 gravity on a lattice , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular a graph , one of whose edges is knotted , can not be mapped by a diffeomorphism to one in which all edges are unknotted , whence the mapping @xmath672 sends spin - network states associated with the two graphs to _ distinct _",
    "solutions to the diffeomorphism constraint . as abstract , non - embedded graphs ,",
    "on the other hand , they can be equivalent and define the same spin - network functions .",
    "one can imagine a new approach in which one simply declares that the diffeomorphism constraint is to be incorporated by replacing embedded spin - networks by abstract ones .",
    "but since the original diffeomorphism constraint acts on the basic canonical variables @xmath691 on @xmath13 and the action can be transferred to graphs only if they are embedded , it would be difficult to justify such an approach from first principles .",
    "+ iii ) note that there are continuous families of 4 or higher valent graphs which can not be mapped to one another by @xmath398 diffeomorphisms with @xmath692 .",
    "consequently , states in @xmath681 based on two of these graphs are mutually orthogonal . thus , even though we have ` factored out ' by a very large group @xmath650 , the hilbert space @xmath681 is still non - separable .",
    "however , if we were to let @xmath693 , i.e. consider homeomorphisms of @xmath13 which preserve the family of graphs under consideration , then these ` problematic ' continuous families of graphs would all be identified in the group averaging procedure and the hilbert space of solutions to the diffeomorphism constraint _ would be _ separable .",
    "however , since the classical constraints do not generate homeomorphims , and furthermore homeomorphisms do not even have a well - defined action on the phase space , it is difficult to ` justify ' this enlargement of @xmath650 from direct physical considerations .",
    "+ iv ) note that @xmath679 is a proper subset of the space @xmath694 of _ all _ elements of @xmath487 invariant under @xmath650 .",
    "however , every @xmath695 can be uniquely decomposed as [ decomp ] ( |  =  _ [ ] ( _ [ ] | , ( _ [ ] | ( _ ) , where @xmath696 $ ] runs through the diffeomorphism classes of graphs .",
    "the sum on the right side is uncountable but the result is a well - defined element of @xmath487 because , in its action on any cylindrical function , only finite number of the terms fail to vanish .",
    "the canonical transformations generated by the gauss and the diffeomorphism constraints are _ kinematical _ gauge symmetries of the classical theory in the sense that , in the space - time picture , they operate at a ` fixed time ' . the crux of quantum dynamics lies in the scalar constraint .",
    "one can imagine implementing it in the quantum theory also by a group averaging procedure . however , this strategy is difficult to adopt because the _ finite _ canonical transformations generated by this constraint are not well - understood even at the classical level .",
    "therefore , one follows the procedure used for the gauss constraint : construct a quantum operator corresponding to the classical , smeared constraint function and then seek its kernel .",
    "because the form of this constraint is so intricate , its implementation is still rather far from being as clean and complete as that of the other two constraints . in particular , genuine ambiguities exist in the regularization procedure and distinct avenues have been pursued [ 95 - 102 ] .",
    "what is non - trivial at this stage is the _ existence _ of well - defined strategies .",
    "whether any of them is fully viable from a physical perspective is still an open issue . in this summary , we will essentially follow the most developed of these approaches , introduced by thiemann @xcite",
    ". however , to bring out quantization ambiguities we have generalized the method , emphasizing points at which there is freedom to modify the original procedure and still arrive at a well - defined constraint operator .",
    "our emphasis is more on clarifying the underlying conceptual structure than on providing efficient calculational tools .      as with area and volume operators ,",
    "our first task is to re - express the classical expression of the scalar constraint as a riemann sum involving only those phase space functions which have direct quantum analogs .",
    "recall from section [ s2 ] that in terms of real connection variables , the scalar constraint ( [ bt ] ) smeared with a lapse @xmath100 can be written as a sum of two terms : ( n ) = ( ) ^ _ d^3x n where , as before , @xmath26 and we have used the relation @xmath697 . had we worked in the + , + , + , + signature and in the half - flat sector @xmath698 , the second term would have been zero .",
    "thus , the first term has the interpretation of the the scalar constraint of euclidean general relativity .",
    "therefore , the full lorentzian constraint can be written as ( n ) = ( n ) - 2(1+^2 ) ( n ) [ c ] where we have used @xmath699 corresponding to the lorentzian signature .     in a cubic partition .",
    "@xmath700 are the edges of the cell and @xmath701 the three oriented loops which are boundaries of faces orthogonal to these edges.,height=288 ]    let us begin by exploring the first term . in comparison with geometric operators discussed in section [ s5 ] , we now have three sets of complications .",
    "first , the expression of @xmath702 involves not only triads @xmath152 but also curvature @xmath703 of the connection @xmath151 .",
    "however , following the standard procedure in gauge theories , it is straightforward to express curvature in terms of holonomies which can be directly promoted to operators .",
    "the second complication arises from the fact that the expression of @xmath704 involves extrinsic curvature terms .",
    "fortunately , we will see that these can be expressed using the poisson bracket between @xmath705 and the total volume , both of which have well - defined operator analogs .",
    "the final complication is the presence of the volume element @xmath706 in the denominator . at first",
    ", this seems to be a fatal drawback .",
    "a key insight of thiemann s @xcite was that this is not the case ( see also @xcite for a further discussion ) .",
    "for , the combination e^i_a  : =   _ abc ^ijk . representing the co - triad @xmath707 can be expressed as a manageable poisson bracket : e^i_a(x )  =  \\{a^i_a(x),v}.[e ] using this fact , the euclidean scalar constraint part @xmath702 is written as ( n )  =  -_m d^3x n(x ) ^abc ( f_ab(x)\\{a_c(x ) , v } ) [ eu]we will see that this this expression is well - suited for quantization .",
    "the second term @xmath704 in the expression ( [ c ] ) of the constraint is given by : ( n )  =  _ m d^3x n ( k_[a^ik_b]^j ) to cast this term in the desired form , we first note that @xmath150 can be expressed as a poisson bracket bracket , k_a^i = \\{a_a^i , |k } where @xmath708 is the integral of the trace of the extrinsic curvature |k  =  k_m d^3x k^i_a p_i^a .",
    "now @xmath708 itself can be expressed as a poisson bracket |k  =  ^-\\{(1),v } .",
    "hence @xmath704 , can be expressed as : ( n ) = - _ m d^3xn(x ) ^abc ( \\{a_a(x ) , |k } \\{a_b(x ) , |k}\\{a_c(x ) , v } ) .",
    "thus , to express the constraint in terms of variables adapted to quantum theory , it only remains to re - express the curvature and connection terms appropriately .",
    "now , if @xmath709 is a line segment of coordinate length @xmath710 and if a loop @xmath206 is the boundary of a coordinate plane @xmath363 of area @xmath711 we have : \\{_s a , v } & = & -[(s)]^-1 \\{(s ) , v } + o ( ) + \\{_s a , |k } & = & -[(s)]^-1 \\{(s ) , |k } + o()and , _ p f  =  ( ( ^-1 ) - ( ) ) + o(^2 ) .",
    "these formulas provide a concrete strategy to replace the connection and curvature terms in terms of holonomies .",
    "for example , if @xmath23 is topologically @xmath549 , it is simplest to introduce a cubic partition where the coordinate length of edges of elementary cells is @xmath710 .",
    "denote by @xmath712 , @xmath713 , @xmath714 , the edges of an elementary cell @xmath715 based at a vertex @xmath716 and by @xmath717 , @xmath718 , and @xmath719 the three oriented loops based at @xmath716 which are boundaries of faces orthogonal to these edges ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "then , the @xmath720 , where _ ( n )  =  - _ i ( ( ( _ i ) - ( _ i^-1 ) ) ( s_i)^-1\\{(s_i ) , v } ) , is a riemann sum which converges to @xmath702 as the cell size tends to zero ( and the number of cells tends to infinity ) .",
    "similarly , the sum @xmath721 _",
    "( n ) = ^ijl ( ( s_i^-1)\\{(s_i),|k } ( s_j^-1 ) \\{(s_j),|k } ( s_l^-1)\\{(s_l),v } ) is a riemann sum which converges to @xmath704 as the cell size tends to zero .",
    "these riemann sums can therefore be regarded as providing a ` regularization ' of the classical constraint . as in the discussion of the geometric operators of section [ s5 ] , the idea is to first replace classical quantities in the ` regularized expression ' by their quantum counterparts and _ then _ remove the regulator . _",
    "a remarkable feature of this regularization , first pointed out by rovelli and smolin @xcite , is that the regulating parameter @xmath710 has disappeared from the expression_. hence it is not necessary to multiply the constraint by a suitable power of @xmath710 before removing the regulator ; no renormalization is involved .     in a general partition .",

    "one encounters three non - trivial issues .    as in the case of geometric operators ,",
    "the first step is rather straightforward because the regulated expressions involve only those phase functions which have direct quantum analogs .",
    "however , while the ` obvious ' quantum operator would be well - defined on states which are cylindrical with respect to any one graph , at the end we have to ensure that the resulting family of operators is consistent .",
    "this is the first non - trivial issue .",
    "the simplest way to address it is to use the decomposition @xmath733 of the hilbert space , introduced in section [ s4.3.3 ] , and define the quantum constraint on each @xmath687 separately . because of the orthogonality of any two @xmath687 , the resulting family of operators would then be automatically consistent .",
    "let us begin with @xmath734 .",
    "fix a subspace @xmath687 of @xmath209 .",
    "the quantum operator can be obtained simply by promoting the holonomies and volume functions to operators and replacing the poisson brackets by @xmath735-times commutators .",

    "we now encounter the second non - trivial issue : we have to ensure that the final operator is diffeomorphism covariant .",
    "to address it , we need to use regulators which are not fixed but transform covariantly as we move from a graph @xmath195 to any of its images under diffeomorphisms .",
    "therefore , we will restrict our regulators appropriately .    a _ diffeomorphism covariant quantum regulator _",
    "@xmath738 is a family of permissible classical regulators , one for each choice of the graph @xmath195 , satisfying the following properties :    * the partition is sufficiently refined in the sense that every vertex @xmath323 of @xmath195 is contained in exactly one cell of @xmath739 ; and , * if @xmath740 is diffeomorphic to @xmath741 then , for every @xmath710 and @xmath742 , the quintuple @xmath743 is diffeomorphic to the quintuple @xmath744 where @xmath715 and @xmath745 are the cells of @xmath730 and @xmath746 respectively , containing @xmath323 and @xmath747 respectively . is non - trivial only if one of the segments @xmath748 of the regulator intersects a vertex of @xmath195 . ]",
    "such diffeomorphism compatible quantum regulators exist ; an explicit example is given in @xcite .",
    "given such a @xmath739 , for every value of @xmath710 , the operators @xmath749 are densely defined on @xmath687 with a common domain @xmath750 .",
    "this family of operators determines a densely defined operator @xmath751 on the full hilbert space @xmath209 with domain @xmath203 , independently of the value of @xmath710 .",
    "furthermore , for any value of @xmath710 , this domain is mapped to itself by the operator @xmath751 .",
    "thus , it only remains to remove the regulator .",
    "here we encounter the third non - trivial issue .",
    "typically @xmath752 is orthogonal to @xmath753 if @xmath754 , whence the operator does not converge ( even in the weak topology ) on @xmath209 .",
    "this is a rather general problem associated with the topology of @xmath209 ; we encountered it also while defining the operator analog of the diffeomorphism constraint @xmath755 .",
    "recall , however , that solutions to the diffeomorphism constraint also fail to lie in the kinematical hilbert space @xmath209 ; they belong to @xmath487 , the algebraic dual of @xmath203 .",
    "therefore , for the consistency of the whole picture , what we need is the action of the scalar constraint only on a sufficiently large subspace of @xmath487 and not on @xmath209 . _ and this action is well - defined and non - trivial . _ more precisely , for each @xmath756 , the action of the regulated constraint operator is naturally given by : | : = ( | for all @xmath757 . we can now remove the regulator in the obvious fashion .",

    "[ celim]note that the limit has to exist only pointwise , i.e. , for each @xmath758 separately . as a consequence the domain of the operator , the set of @xmath759 in @xmath487 for which the limit exists , is quite large . in particular , as discussed below , it includes a large class of solutions to the diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "the term @xmath704 in the scalar constraint can be handled in a completely parallel fashion .",
    "specifically , we can first define the operator @xmath760 through  : =   [ , ^e(1 ) ] and use @xmath760 and the quantum regulator @xmath738 to define the regulated operator @xmath761 : ( |_(n )  =  t^ijk ( | ( & & ( s_i^-1)[_s_i , ] ( s_j^-1)[(s_j ) , ] + & & ( s_k^-1 ) [ ( s_k),]),[te ] on the domain @xmath487 .",
    "collecting these definitions , we now have a regulated scalar constraint operator : ( |_r_(n ) : = ( | ( _ r_(n )  - 2(1 + ^2 ) _ _ ( n))[clim ] for all @xmath762 .",
    "again , we can remove the regulator by taking the limit as @xmath763 as in ( [ celim ] ) . by construction ,",
    "the action of this operator is diffeomorphism covariant .",
    "thus , each diffeomorphism covariant quantum regulator defines a scalar constraint operator .",
    "since there is a great deal of freedom in choosing these regulators , there is considerable quantization ambiguity .",
    "nonetheless , all these constructions exhibit some very non - trivial properties .",
    "we will conclude this section by providing two illustrations .",
    "first , as mentioned in the beginning of this section , it is significant that well defined prescriptions exist to give precise meaning to quantum einstein equations in a background independent setting . in geometrodynamics , for example",
    ", the wheeler - dewitt equation still remains only formal .",
    "secondly , these constructions match surprisingly well with the solutions of the diffeomorphism constraint . to see this note first that , irrespective of the choice of the diffeomorphism covariant quantum regulator , _ up to diffeomorphisms _ , the operator @xmath764 is independent of @xmath710 :",
    "for every @xmath765 and @xmath766 , there is a diffeomorphism @xmath638 such that _ r_(n ) |",
    "= u__r_(n ) | , for every @xmath100 . next , suppose that @xmath767 is diffeomorphism invariant",
    ". then , for every lapse function @xmath100 , the result @xmath768 , is in fact _ independent _ of @xmath710 , and so is the expression under the limit on the right hand side of ( [ clim ] ) .",
    "hence the regulator can be removed trivially @xcite .",
    "thus because of the form of the regulated operators , diffeomorphism invariant states in @xmath487 ( constructed by group averaging elements of @xmath769 ) are automatically in the domain of the scalar constraint operator .",
    "this tight matching between the way in which the two constraints are handled is quite non - trivial .    _",
    "remark : _ in the original construction by thiemann @xcite , the hamiltonian constraint operator was defined on @xmath770 .",
    "now , as we saw in section [ s2 ] , the poisson bracket of any two scalar constraints is given by a diffeomorphism constraint in the classical theory .",
    "therefore , on diffeomorphism invariant states , one would expect the quantum scalar constraint operators to commute .",
    "irrespective of the choice of the regulator @xmath730 , they do . to obtain a more stringent test ,",
    "the domain of the thiemann operator was extended slightly in @xcite .",
    "the extended domain , called the ` habitat ' @xcite , also includes certain elements of @xmath487 which are not diffeomorphism invariant . nonetheless , it turned out that the commutator between scalar constraints continues to vanish on the habitat .",
    "this may seem alarming at first .",
    "however , it turns out that the quantum operator corresponding to the classical poisson bracket also annihilates every state in the habitat @xcite .",
    "thus , there is no inconsistency ; the habitat just turned out to be too small to provide a non - trivial viability criterion of this quantization procedure .",
    "the domain of the operator introduced in this section includes the habitat and the same result continues to hold .",
    "more importantly , it is likely that this domain is significantly larger and may contain semi - classical states . if this turns out to be the case , stronger viability criteria to test this quantization procedure will become available . in particular , in addition to the relation to the classical poisson algebra of constraints , one may be able to analyze the relation between the classical evolution and the action of the constraint on semi - classical states .      in this section , we will illustrate how the difficult problem of finding solutions to the quantum constraints can be systematically reduced to a series of simpler problems .",
    "for this , we will need to make the quantum regulator @xmath739 more specific .",
    "the most convenient class of regulators requires some modifications in the original construction due to thiemann .",
    "restrictions defining this class can be summarized as follows .",
    "fix a graph @xmath195 and consider a cell @xmath715 containing a vertex @xmath323 in the partition of @xmath23 defined by the regulator .",
    "the first restriction is that every edge @xmath771 assigned to @xmath715 must be a proper segment of an edge incident at @xmath323 , oriented to be outgoing at @xmath323 .",
    "the next restriction is on the closed loops @xmath206 . to every pair of edges @xmath772",
    "assign a triangular closed loop @xmath773 such that : i ) the loop contains @xmath323 but no other point in the graph @xmath195 ; ii ) it lies ` between ' the 2-edges , in a 2-plane containing the edges , where the plane is defined up to diffeomorphisms preserving @xmath195 ; and iii ) it is oriented clockwise with respect to the orientation defined in the plane by the ordered pair of segments @xmath774 .",
    "( the double index @xmath775 labelling the loop corresponds to the single index @xmath776 before , e.g. in ( [ ce ] ) . ) finally , the constants @xmath777 and @xmath732 of the regulator are , respectively , @xmath778 and @xmath779 depending on the orientation of a triad of vectors tangent to the segments @xmath780 at @xmath323 relative to the background orientation on @xmath23 , where @xmath781 and @xmath782 are fixed constants .",
    "given such a regulator , the action of the resulting operators @xmath783 and @xmath784 on diffeomorphism invariant elements of @xmath487 has a rather simple geometric structure which can be roughly summarized as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath785 is obtained by group averaging a state in @xmath687 .",
    "then , if @xmath195 contains no closed loops of the type introduced by the regulator at any of its vertices , it is annihilated by both the operators .",
    "if @xmath195 does contain such closed loops , @xmath783 removes one loop , @xmath784 removes two loops , and in each case there is also a possible change in the intertwiners at the vertex . following a terminology introduced by thiemann in his regularization",
    ", closed loops of the type introduced by the regulator will be called _",
    "more precisely , constraint operators act as follows .",
    "consider a labelled graph @xmath786 such that no labelled graph belonging to the same diffeomorphism class contains an extraordinary loop labelled by @xmath787 where @xmath729 is the representation used in the regularization . call a labelled graph with this property _ simple_. given a simple graph @xmath195 , all states @xmath788 in @xmath789 obtained by group averaging elements of @xmath790 are in the kernel of @xmath784 .",
    "this is a large class of solutions .",
    "however , these states are annihilated by each of the two terms , @xmath783 and @xmath791 , of @xmath784 separately whence they solve both the euclidean and the lorentzian scalar constraint . in this sense , they are the analogs of time - symmetric solutions to the classical hamiltonian constraint and will at best capture very special physical situations .",
    "more interesting solutions can be obtained starting from graphs which do admit extraordinary edges .",
    "we begin by introducing some notation .",
    "consider the set of all the labelled graphs @xmath792 that can be obtained from a given @xmath786 by creation of @xmath198 extraordinary loops labelled by @xmath787 , and by the diffeomorphisms .",
    "denote this set by @xmath793)]}$ ] and denote by @xmath794}$ ] the linear span of the corresponding diffeomorphism averaged spin - network states .",
    "the resulting spaces are _ finite _ dimensional and have trivial intersection with one another : ( [ ( _ 0,j_0)],n)= ( [ ( _0,j_0)],n )  ^(n)_[(_0,j_0 ) ] ^(m)_[(_0,j_0)]=\\ { 0}. as a consequence , one can show that they have the following very useful property : every @xmath795 can be uniquely decomposed as [ dec ] ( |  =  _ , j , n ( |_(n)[(,j ) ] , ( |_(n)[(,j)]^(n)_[(,j ) ] .",
    "the availability of this decomposition systematizes the task of finding solutions to the scalar constraint .",
    "let us begin with @xmath783 .",
    "for the euclidean theory , one can obtain the following surprising result : ( |(n )  =  0  ( |_(n)[(,j ) ]  =  0 ,  for  every [ ( , j ) ] , n. thus , _",
    "@xmath759 is a solution of the euclidean part of the constraint if and only if each of its components with respect to the decomposition ( [ dec ] ) is a also solution .",
    "_ this is a very useful property because the problem of finding a general diffeomorphism invariant solution to the euclidean constraint is reduced to that of finding solutions in _ finite _ dimensional subspaces . on each of these sub - spaces",
    ", one has just to find the kernel of certain matrices , a problem that can be readily put on a computer .",
    "reciprocally , given any diffeomorphism invariant solution to the constraint e.g .",
    "the state supported just on flat connections the decomposition provides a family of new solutions . in 2 + 1",
    "dimensions this property implies that any semi - classical state can be obtained by a superposition of these ` elementary ' solutions .",
    "finally , let us turn to the full ( lorentzian ) scalar constraint operator , @xmath784 . in the present scheme ,",
    "the problem of obtaining diffeomorphism invariant solutions is reduced to a hierarchy of steps .",
    "more precisely , the equation ( |(n )  =  0 , is equivalent to the following hierarchy of equations ( _ ( 1)[,j]| ( n ) & = & 0 , + ( _ ( 2)[,j]| ( n ) & = & ( _ ( 1)[,j]| ( n ) , + .&.&. + ( _ ( n+1)[,j]| ( n ) & = & _ n ( _ ( n)[,j]| ( n ) , + .&.&. in general , the procedure involves infinitely many steps .",
    "however , it gives a partial control on the solutions and suggests new anstze , e.g. requiring that the series terminate after a finite number of steps .",
    "_ remark : _ since the procedure outlined above is a variation on thiemann s original strategy , it is worth comparing the relative merits .",
    "thiemann s procedure is simpler in that two of the three edges of triangles @xmath723 ( holonomy around which captures the curvature term in @xmath702 ) are along edges of the graph under consideration .",
    "however , now the analogs of our spaces @xmath796 overlap , making the procedure for solving the constraint more complicated .    to summarize , in this section we have presented a general framework for defining the hamiltonian constraint and for finding its solutions .",
    "this procedure provides a good handle on the problem and also brings out the ambiguities involved . specifically , each choice of a diffeomorphism covariant quantum regulator @xmath739 gives rise to a quantum constraint operator @xmath797 on @xmath798 . for each choice of the regulator",
    ", there is also a certain factor ordering freedom which was ignored for brevity . in general these operators will differ from each other , defining distinct quantum dynamics and one has to invoke _ physical _ criteria to test their viability .",
    "quantum cosmology results discussed in section [ s7 ] favor the factor ordering used here .",
    "there have also been attempts at restricting the freedom in the choice of the quantum regulator by imposing heuristically motivated conditions .",
    "however , a canonical choice has not emerged .",
    "thus , there is still a great deal of ambiguity and it is not clear if any of the candidates are fully viable .",
    "a key criterion is that the the solution set to the constraints should be rich enough to admit a large number of semi - classical states .",
    "this issue will not be systematically resolved until one has a greater control on the semi - classical sector of the theory . as discussed above",
    "there is now a general strategy to find solutions , whence one can hope to address this issue .",
    "partial support for this strategy comes from 2 + 1 dimensional euclidean general relativity . as mentioned above , in this theory ,",
    "all semi - classical states can be recovered by superposing the ` elementary solutions ' to quantum constraints , obtained via our systematic procedure .",
    "this result is encouraging because the 2 + 1 theory has all the conceptual problems associated with the absence of a background geometry .",
    "however , it can not be taken as a strong indication because the 2 + 1 dimensional theory has only a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this concludes the general framework for quantum kinematics and dynamics . in the next three sections we will discuss various applications",
    "in cosmology , one generally freezes all but a finite number of degrees of freedom by imposing spatial homogeneity ( and sometimes also isotropy ) . because of the resulting mathematical simplifications , the framework provides a simple arena to test ideas and constructions introduced in the full theory both at the classical and quantum levels .",
    "moreover , in the classical regime , the symmetry reduction captures the large scale dynamics of the universe as a whole quite well .",
    "therefore , in the quantum theory , it provides a fertile test bed for analyzing the important issues related to the fate of the initial singularity ( highlighted in section [ s1 ] ) . over the last three years , bojowald and",
    "his collaborators have made striking advances in this area by exploiting the quantum nature of geometry [ 104 - 117 ] . in this section",
    "we will provide a self - contained summary of the core developments using constructions which mimic the ones introduced in sections [ s4][s6 ] .",
    "( for subtleties and details , see especially @xcite . )",
    "loop quantum cosmology also provides a number of lessons for the full theory .",
    "however , to fully understand their implications , it is important to keep track of the differences between the symmetry reduced and the full theories .",
    "the most obvious difference is the tremendous simplification resulting from the reduction of a field theory to a mechanical system .",
    "however , there are also two other differences which make it conceptually and technically _ more _ complicated , at least when one tries to directly apply the methods developed for the full theory in section [ s6 ] .",
    "first , the reduced theory is usually treated by gauge fixing and therefore fails to be diffeomorphism invariant . as a result ,",
    "key simplifications that occur in the treatment of full quantum dynamics do not carry over and , in a certain sense , dynamics now acquires _",
    "new _ ambiguities in the reduced theory !",
    "the second complication arises from the fact that spatial homogeneity introduces distant correlations .",
    "consequently , in contrast to section [ s4 ] , quantum states associated with distinct edges and electric flux operators associated with distinct 2-surfaces are no longer independent .",
    "both these features give rise to certain complications which are _ not _ shared by the full theory .",
    "once these differences are taken in to account , loop quantum cosmology can be used to gain valuable insights about certain qualitative features of the methods introduced in section [ s6.3 ] to formulate and solve the hamiltonian constraint in the full theory .      for simplicity",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to spatially homogeneous , isotropic cosmologies .",
    "( for non - isotropic models , see @xcite .",
    "specifically , we will focus only on the case where the isometry group @xmath449 is the euclidean group .",
    "then the 3-dimensional group @xmath799 of translations ( ensuring homogeneity ) acts simply and transitively on the 3-manifold @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 is topologically @xmath800 .",
    "it is convenient to fix on @xmath23 a fiducial flat metric @xmath801 , an associated constant orthonormal triad @xmath802 and the dual co - triad @xmath803 .",
    "let us now turn to the gravitational phase space in the connection variables . as we saw in section [ s2 ] , in the full theory , the phase space consists of pairs @xmath804 of fields on a 3-manifold @xmath13 , where @xmath151 is an @xmath184 connection and @xmath152 a triplet of vector fields with density weight 1 .",
    "a pair @xmath805 on @xmath13 will be said to be spatially homogeneous and isotropic or , for brevity , _ symmetric _ if for every @xmath806 there exists a local gauge transformation @xmath807 , such that [ ge ] ( s^a^ , s^p^ )  = ( g^-1ag + g^-1dg , g^-1pg ) . as is usual in cosmology , we will fix the local diffeomorphism and gauge freedom . to do so , note first that for every symmetric @xmath808 ( satisfying the gauss and diffeomorphism constraints ) there exists an equivalent pair @xmath809 ( under ( [ ge ] ) ) such that [ ss ] a  =   ^i _ i ,  = _ i^i where @xmath810 and @xmath811 are constants , carrying the only non - trivial information contained in the pair @xmath812 , and the density weight of @xmath813 has been absorbed in the determinant of the fiducial metric .",
    "denote by @xmath814 and @xmath815 the subspace of the gravitational configuration space @xmath219 and of the gravitational phase space @xmath816 defined by ( [ ss ] ) .",
    "tangent vectors @xmath817 to @xmath818 are of the form : [ tv ] = ( a , p ) , a ( ) _ a^i , ( ) ^a_i .",
    "thus , @xmath814 is 1-dimensional and @xmath818 is 2-dimensional : we made a restriction to _ symmetric _ fields and solved and gauge - fixed the gauge and the diffeomorphism constraints , thereby reducing the infinite , local , gravitational degrees of freedom to just one .    because @xmath13 is non - compact and fields are spatially homogeneous ,",
    "various integrals featuring in the hamiltonian framework of section [ s2 ] diverge .",
    "this is in particular the case for the symplectic structure of the full theory .",
    "however , one can bypass this problem in a natural fashion : fix a ` cell ' @xmath819 adapted to the fiducial triad and restrict all integrations to this cell .",
    "the volume @xmath820 of this cell ( with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath801 ) can also be used to absorb the dependence of the basic variables @xmath821 on the fiducial @xmath801 .",
    "let us rescale the basic variables to remove this dependence , c : = v_o^ p : = 8 g v_o^ , and express the gravitational symplectic structure @xmath54 on @xmath816 in terms of them : ( _ 1 , _ 2 ) & = & _ v d^3x ( _ 1 a^i_a(x)_2 p_i^a(x ) - _ 2 a^i_a(x)_1 p_i^a(x ) ) + & = & 3 dc dp .",
    "this expression also makes no reference to the fiducial metric ( or the volume @xmath820 of the cell @xmath819 ) .",
    "we will work with this phase space description .",
    "note that now the configuration variable @xmath822 is dimensionless while the momentum variable @xmath383 has dimensions @xmath823 .",
    "( while comparing results in the full theory , it is important to bear in mind that these dimensions are different from those of the gravitational connection and the triad there . ) in terms of @xmath383 , the physical triad and co - triad are given by : [ e1 ] e^a_i = ( sgnp ) |p|^-",
    "( v_o^ ^a_i ) , e_a^i = ( sgn p ) |p|^ ( v_o^- _ a^o ) we have specified the gravitational part of the reduced phase space .",
    "we will not need to specify matter fields explicitly but only note that , upon similar restriction to symmetric fields and fixing of gauge and diffeomorphism freedom , one is led to a finite dimensional phase space also for matter fields .",
    "finally , let us turn to constraints .",
    "since the gauss and the diffeomorphism constraints are already satisfied , there is a single non - trivial scalar / hamiltonian constraint ( corresponding to a constant lapse ) : [ scalar ] - c^2 sgnp + c_matter  =  0 .",
    "we will now adapt the general procedure of sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] to the symmetry reduced phase space and emphasize how it leads to interesting departures from the ` standard ' quantum cosmology in geometrodynamic variables .",
    "let us begin by singling out ` elementary functions ' on the classical phase space which are to have unambiguous quantum analogs . in the full theory ,",
    "the configuration variables were constructed from holonomies @xmath368 associated with edges @xmath192 and momentum variables , from @xmath824 , triads @xmath825 smeared with test fields @xmath241 on 2-surfaces .",
    "but now , because of homogeneity and isotropy , we do not need all edges @xmath192 and surfaces @xmath7 .",
    "symmetric connections @xmath124 in @xmath814 can be recovered knowing holonomies @xmath826 along straight lines in @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , it is now appropriate to smear triads only by constant fields , @xmath827 , and across squares to which the fiducial triads @xmath802 are tangent .. we chose not to break the symmetry artificially and consider instead all lines and all rectangles . ]    the @xmath184 holonomy along an edge @xmath192 is given by : a(e ) = + 2 [ ] ( ^a_a^i ) ^i where @xmath828 is the oriented length of the edge .",
    "therefore , a typical element of the algebra generated by sums of products of matrix elements of these holonomies can be written as [ f ] f(a ) = _ j _ j e^i_j c where @xmath266 runs over a finite number of integers ( labelling edges ) , @xmath829 and @xmath830 .",
    "these are precisely the _ almost periodic functions _ which have been studied in the mathematical literature in detail .",
    "one can regard a finite number of edges as providing us with a graph ( since , because of homogeneity , the edges need not actually meet in vertices now ) and the function @xmath831 as a cylindrical function with respect to that graph .",
    "the vector space of these almost periodic functions is the space of cylindrical functions of symmetric connections and will be denoted by @xmath832 .    to define the momentum functions ,",
    "we are now led to smear the triads with constant test functions and integrate them on a square ( with respect to the fiducial metric ) .",
    "the resulting phase space function is then just @xmath383 multiplied by a kinematic factor .",

    "note that , in contrast with the full theory , now there is only one momentum variable whence non - commutativity of triads is no longer an issue .",
    "therefore , the triad representation also exists in quantum theory .",
    "in fact it turns out to be convenient in making the quantum dynamics explicit .      to construct quantum kinematics ,",
    "let us seek a representation of this algebra of elementary variables .",
    "we will find that the quantum theory is quite different from the ` standard ' geometrodynamical quantum cosmology .",
    "this differences arises from the fact that the configuration variables are not smooth functions of compact support on @xmath834 , but rather , almost periodic functions . as we saw in section [ s7.2.1 ] , this choice can be directly traced back to the full theory where holonomies play a primary role .",
    "because we are repeating the procedure used in the full theory as closely as possible , the fundamental discreteness underlying polymer geometry will trickle down to quantum cosmology and lead to results which are _ qualitatively different _ from those in standard quantum cosmology .",

    "@xmath832 is dense in @xmath842 , and serves as a common domain for all elementary operators .",
    "the configuration and momentum operators have expected actions : ( _  ) ( ) & = & f ( ) n_ ( ) + ( _  ) ( ) & = & n_(a ) . as in the full theory ,",

    "holonomy operators are well - defined but there is no operator representing the connection itself .",
    "similarly , @xmath852 are well defined unitary operators on @xmath839 but they fail to be continuous with respect to @xmath853 , whence there is no operator corresponding to @xmath822 on @xmath841 .",
    "thus , as in section [ s4.3 ] , to obtain physically interesting operators , one has to _ first express them in terms of the elementary variables @xmath843 and @xmath383 and then promote those expressions to the quantum theory .",
    "_    there is , however , one important difference between the full and the reduced theories : while eigenvalues of the momentum ( and other geometric ) operators in the full theory span only a discrete subset of the real line , now every real number is a permissible eigenvalue of @xmath844 .",
    "this difference can be directly attributed to the high degree of symmetry . in the full theory",
    ", eigenvectors are labelled by a pair @xmath854 consisting of continuous label @xmath192 ( denoting an edge ) and a discrete label @xmath266 ( denoting the ` spin ' on that edge ) , and the eigenvalue is dictated by @xmath266 .",
    "because of homogeneity and isotropy , the pair @xmath855 has now collapsed to a single continuous label @xmath853 .",
    "note however that there _ is _ a weaker sense in which the spectrum is discrete : all eigenvectors are _ normalizable_. hence the hilbert space can be expanded out as a direct _ sum _",
    "rather than a direct integral of the 1-dimensional eigenspaces of @xmath844 ; i.e. , the decomposition of identity on @xmath856 is given by a ( continuous ) sum i = _  || rather than an integral .",
    "consequently , the natural topology on the spectrum of @xmath844 is _",
    "discrete_. although weaker , this discreteness plays a critical role both technically and conceptually .      in the reduced classical theory ,",
    "curvature is simply a multiple of the _ inverse _ of the square of the scale factor @xmath857 .",
    "similarly , the matter hamiltonian invariably involves a term corresponding to an _ inverse _ power of @xmath858 .",
    "therefore , one needs to obtain an operator corresponding to the inverse scale factor , or the triad ( with density weight zero ) of ( [ e1 ] ) . in the classical theory ,",
    "the triad coefficient diverges at the big bang and a key question is whether quantum effects ` tame ' the big bang sufficiently to make the triad operator ( and hence the curvature and the matter hamiltonian ) well behaved there .",
    "now , given a self adjoint operator @xmath859 on a hilbert space , the function @xmath860 is well - defined if and only if @xmath241 is a measurable function on the spectrum of @xmath124 .",
    "thus , for example , in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the spectrum of the operator @xmath861 is the positive half of the real line , equipped with the standard lesbegue measure , whence the operator @xmath862 is a well - defined , self - adjoint operator .",
    "by contrast , the spectrum of @xmath844 has discrete topology and @xmath863^{-1}$ ] is not a measurable function of @xmath844 .",
    "more explicitly , since @xmath844 admits a _ normalized _ eigenvector @xmath864 with zero eigenvalue , the naive expression of the triad operator fails to be densely defined on @xmath839 .",
    "one could circumvent this problem in the reduced model in an ad - hoc manner by just making up a definition for the action of the triad operator on @xmath864 .",
    "but then the result would have to be considered as an artifact of a procedure expressly invented for the model and one would not have any confidence in its implications for the big bang .",
    "however , we saw in section [ s6.3 ] that a similar problem arises in the full theory and can be resolved using a strategy due to thiemann .",
    "it is natural to use the same procedure also in quantum cosmology . as in the general theory , therefore , we will proceed in two steps . in the first",
    ", we note that , on the reduced phase space @xmath865 , the triad coefficient @xmath866 can be expressed as the poisson bracket @xmath867 which can be replaced by @xmath868 times the commutator in quantum theory .",
    "however , as in the full theory , a second step is necessary because there is no operator @xmath869 on @xmath839 corresponding to @xmath822 : one has to re - express the poisson bracket in terms of _ holonomies _ which do have unambiguous quantum analogs .",
    "the resulting triad ( coefficient ) operator is given by : [ qtriad1 ] = - ( ^ - ^ ) where @xmath870 is the eigenvalue of the volume operator given in ( [ vol2 ] ) . although the triad involves both configuration and momentum operators , it commutes with @xmath844 , whence its eigenvectors are again @xmath847 .",
    "the eigenvalues are given by : |= ( v_+1 ^ 1/3 - v^1/3_-1 ) |",
    ".where @xmath870 is the eigenvalue of the volume operator ( see ( [ vol2 ] ) ) .",
    "a key property of the triad operator follows immediately : it is bounded above !",
    "the upper bound is obtained at the value @xmath871 :    proportional to @xmath872 , in quantum theory , it is bounded above by @xmath873 .",
    "note that @xmath8 is essential for the existence of this upper bound ; as @xmath8 tends to zero , the bound goes to infinity just as one would expect from classical considerations .",
    "this is rather reminiscent of the situation with the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , @xmath874 , which is bounded from below because @xmath8 is non - zero .",
    "while this boundedness is physically appealing , at first it also seems puzzling because the triad coefficient and the momentum are algebraically related in the classical theory via @xmath875 and @xmath844 admits a _ normalized _ eigenvector with zero eigenvalue .",
    "a key criterion of viability of the triad operator is that the classical relation should be respected in an appropriate sense .",
    "more precisely , one can tolerate violations of this condition on states only in the planck regime ; the equality must be satisfied to an excellent approximation on states with large @xmath853 ( i.e. , with large volume ) .",
    "is this the case ?",
    "we have : [ approximate ] ( v_+1 ^ 1/3 - v^1/3_-1 ) & = & ( - ) + & = & ( 1+o(^-2 ) ) thus , up to order @xmath876 , the eigenvalue of the triad operator is precisely @xmath877 , where @xmath878 is the eigenvalue of @xmath844 ( see ( [ vol2 ] ) ) . on states representing a large universe ( @xmath879 ) , the classical algebraic relation between the triad coefficient and @xmath383",
    "is indeed preserved to an excellent approximation .",
    "violations are significant only on the eigen - subspace of the volume operator with eigenvalues of the order of @xmath880 or less , i.e. , in the fully quantum regime .",
    "since the classical triad diverges at the big bang , it is perhaps not surprising that quantum effects usher - in the planck scale .",
    "however , the mechanism by which this came about is new and conceptually important .",
    "for , the procedure did not call for a cut - off or a regulator . the classical expression of the triad coefficient we began with",
    "is _ exact _ whence the issue of removing the regulator does not arise . it _ is _ true that the quantization procedure is somewhat ` indirect ' .",
    "however , this was necessary because _ the spectrum of the momentum operator @xmath844 _ ( or of the ` scale factor operator ' corresponding to @xmath858 ) _ is discrete _ in the sense detailed in section [ s7.2 ] . had the hilbert space @xmath881 been a direct integral of the eigenspaces of @xmath844 rather than a direct sum the triad operator could then have been defined directly using the spectral decomposition of @xmath844 and would have been unbounded above . indeed , this is precisely what happens in geometrodynamics .",
    "thus , the key differences between the mathematical structures of the present quantum theory and quantum geometrodynamics are responsible for the boundedness of the triad coefficient on the entire hilbert space @xcite .",
    "a natural question then is : how can there be such inequivalent quantizations ?",
    "after all , here we are dealing with a system with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "does nt the von neumann uniqueness theorem ensure that there is a unique representation of the exponentiated heisenberg relations ?",
    "the answer is no : von neumann s theorem requires that the unitary operators @xmath882 corresponding respectively to the classical functions @xmath883 and @xmath884 be _ weakly continuous _ in the parameters @xmath853 and @xmath642 . as we noted in section [ s7.2.2 ] , this assumption is violated by @xmath885 in our representation this in fact is the reason why there is no operator corresponding to @xmath822 and only the holonomies are well defined . a priori",
    ", it may seem that by dropping the continuity requirement , one opens up a pandora s box . which of the possible representations is one to use ?",
    "the most important aspect of this construction is that it came directly from the full theory where , as discussed at the end of section [ s4.3.4 ] , diffeomorphism invariance severely constrains the choice representation .",
    "since the curvature is bounded above on the entire kinematical hilbert space @xmath839 , one might expect that the classical singularity at the big bang would be naturally resolved in the quantum theory .",
    "this turns out to be the case .      rather than starting from the reduced hamiltonian constraint ( [ scalar ] ) , to bring out the relation to the full theory",
    ", we will return to the full constraint and use the procedure spelled out in section [ s6.3 ] .",
    "because of spatial homogeneity and flatness , two simplifications arise : i ) the two terms in the expression ( [ c ] ) of the full hamiltonian constraint are now proportional ; and , ii ) without loss of generality one can restrict ourself to a constant lapse function @xmath100 , and we will just set it to one .",
    "then , the gravitational part of the constraint can be written as : _",
    "grav = - _ ijk f_ab^i as in section [ s6.3 ] , we have to ` regulate ' this classical expression by writing it in terms of phase space functions which can be directly promoted to quantum operators . as in the full theory",

    "consider a square @xmath886 in the @xmath776-@xmath266 plane spanned by two of the triad vectors @xmath802 , each of whose sides has length @xmath887 with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath801 . then",

    "next , let us consider the triad term @xmath890 . as in the full theory",
    ", this can be handled through the thiemann regularization .",
    "thus , let us begin with the identity on the symmetry reduced phase space @xmath891 : [ cotriad ] _",
    "ijk^i = -2 ( _o ( 8g)^1/2 v_o^1/3)^-1 ^abc ^k_c a(e_k ) \\{a(e_k^-1 ) , v } where @xmath892 is the holonomy along the edge @xmath893 parallel to the @xmath894th basis vector of length @xmath887 with respect to @xmath801 .",
    "note that , unlike the expression ( [ f ] ) for @xmath703 , ( [ cotriad ] ) is exact , i.e. does not depend on the choice of @xmath895 .",
    "collecting terms , we can now express the gravitational part of the ` regulated ' constraint as : [ reg ] _",
    "grav^_o = -4(8g^3_o^3 ) ^-1 _ ijk ^ijktr ( a(e_i )",
    "a(e_j ) a(e_i^-1 ) a(e_j^-1 ) a(e_k)\\{a(e_k^-1 ) , v } ) where , the term proportional to identity in the leading contribution to @xmath703 in ( [ f ] ) drops out because of the trace operation and where we used @xmath896 . in the limit @xmath897 , the right side of @xmath898 reproduces the classical expression ( [ scalar ] ) of the constraint .",
    "thus , @xmath895 or the length of the edge used while expressing @xmath899 in terms of the holonomy around the square @xmath900 plays the role of a regulator in ( [ reg ] ) .",
    "because of the presence of the curvature term , there is no natural way to express the constraint _",
    "exactly _ in terms of our elementary variables ; a limiting procedure is essential .",
    "this faithfully mirrors the situation in the full theory : there , again , the curvature term is recovered by introducing small loops at vertices of graphs and the classical expression of the constraint is recovered only in the limit in which the loop shrinks to zero .",
    "it is now straightforward to pass to quantum theory .",
    "the regulated quantum constraint is : [ qreg ] _",

    ", one could remove the regulator to obtain a well - defined operator on ( suitable ) diffeomorphism invariant states in @xmath487 . the reduced model , on the other hand , does not have diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "therefore , one would expect that the obvious @xmath902 limit would run in to problems .",
    "this is indeed what happens . in this limit ,",
    "the classical regulated expression ( [ reg ] ) equals the hamiltonian constraint ( [ scalar ] ) which , however , contains @xmath903 .",

    "however , since @xmath905 is not well - defined on @xmath839 , now the limit as @xmath897 fails to exist . thus , one can not remove the regulator in the quantum theory of the reduced model .",
    "this feature can be traced back directly to the symmetry reduction @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that the presence of @xmath895 in the quantum hamiltonian constraint should be regarded as a quantization ambiguity . indeed , as we discussed in section [ s6.3 ] , even in the full theory , there is a similar ambiguity associated with the choice of the @xmath266 label used on the new edges introduced to define the operator corresponding to @xmath899 @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in the full theory , the quantization procedure involves the introduction of a pair of labels @xmath855 where @xmath192 is a continuous label denoting the new edge and @xmath266 is a discrete label denoting the spin on that edge .",
    "diffeomorphism invariance ensures that the quantum constraint is insensitive to the choice of @xmath192 but the dependence on @xmath266 remains as a quantization ambiguity . in the reduced model , diffeomorphism invariance",

    "label @xmath895 .",
    "if one works in the strict confines of the reduced model , there does not appear to exist a natural way to remove this ambiguity . in the full theory , on the other hand , one can fix the ambiguity by assigning the _ lowest _ non - trivial @xmath266 value , @xmath906 , to each extra loop introduced to determine the operator analog of @xmath899 .",
    "this procedure can be motivated by the following heuristics . in the classical theory",
    ", one can use a loop enclosing an arbitrarily small area in the @xmath858-@xmath907 plane to determine @xmath899 locally . in quantum geometry",
    ", on the other hand , the area operator ( of an open surface ) has a lowest eigenvalue @xmath908 , suggesting that it is _ physically _ inappropriate to try to localize @xmath899 on arbitrarily small surfaces .",
    "the best one could do is to consider a loop spanning an area @xmath909 , consider the holonomy around the loop to determine the integral of @xmath899 on a surface of area @xmath909 , and then extract an effective , local @xmath899 by setting the integral equal to @xmath910 .",
    "it appears natural to use the same physical considerations to remove the quantization ambiguity also in the reduced model .",
    "then , we are led to set the area of the smallest square spanned by @xmath900 to @xmath909 , i.e. to set @xmath911 , or @xmath912 . thus , while in the reduced model itself , area eigenvalues can assume arbitrarily small values , if one ` imports ' from the full theory the value of the smallest non - zero area eigenvalue , one is naturally led to set @xmath912 .",
    "to summarize , in loop quantum cosmology , one adopts the viewpoint that ( [ qreg ] ) , with @xmath913 , is the ` fundamental ' hamiltonian constraint operator which ` correctly ' incorporates the underlying discreteness of quantum geometry and the classical expression ( [ scalar ] ) is an approximation which is valid only in regimes where this discreteness can be ignored and the continuum picture is valid .",
    "this viewpoint is borne out by detailed calculations @xcite : the expectation values of @xmath914 in semi - classical states reproduce the classical constraint .",
    "furthermore , one can calculate corrections to the classical expression arising from the fundamental discreteness and quantum fluctuations inherent in the semi - classical quantum states @xcite .",
    "let us now solve the quantum constraint and obtain physical states . for simplicity , we assume",
    "that the matter is only minimally coupled to gravity ( i.e. , there are no curvature couplings ) . as in non -",
    "trivially constrained systems , one expects that the physical states would fail to be normalizable in the kinematical hilbert space @xmath915 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as in the full theory , they do have a natural ` home ' .",
    "we again have a triplet @xmath916 of spaces and physical states will belong to @xmath917 , the algebraic dual of @xmath832 .",
    "since elements of @xmath917 need not be normalizable , as in section [ s6.3 ] , we will denote them by @xmath759 .",
    "( the usual , normalizable bras will be denoted by @xmath918 . )",
    "it is convenient to exploit the existence of a triad representation .",

    "note that the sum is over a continuous variable @xmath853 whence @xmath759 need not be normalizable .",
    "now , the constraint equation ( |(_grav^(_o ) + 8g_matter^(_o ) ) ^ = 0turns into the equation [ de1 ] & & ( v_+5_o - v_+3_o ) ( , +4_o ) - 2(v_+_o - v_ - _o ) ( ,  ) + & + & ( v_-3_o - v_-5_o ) ( , -4_o ) = -8g^3_o^3 ^ 2 _ matter^(_o)( ) ( ,  ) for the coefficients @xmath921 , where @xmath922 only acts on the matter fields ( and depends on @xmath853 via metric components in the matter hamiltonian ) . note that , even though @xmath853 is a continuous variable , the quantum constraint is a _ difference _ equation rather than a differential equation .",
    "strictly , ( [ de1 ] ) just constrains the coefficients @xmath921 to ensure that @xmath759 is a physical state . as in the full quantum theory",
    ", we do not have a background space - time , hence no natural notion of ` time ' or ` evolution ' .",
    "however , since each @xmath920 is an eigenbra of the volume operator , it tells us how the matter wave function is correlated with volume , i.e. , geometry .",
    "now , if one wishes , one can regard @xmath383 as providing a heuristic ` notion of time ' , and then think of ( [ de1 ] ) as an evolution equation for the quantum state of matter with respect to this time .",
    "( note that @xmath383 goes from @xmath923 to @xmath924 , negative values corresponding to triads which are oppositely oriented to the fiducial one .",

    "this heuristic interpretation often provides physical intuition for ( [ de1 ] ) ; one can regard it as a discrete ` evolution ' equation .",

    "what is the fate of the classical singularity ? at the big bang , the scale factor goes to zero .",
    "hence it corresponds to the state @xmath926 in @xmath839 .",
    "so , the key question is whether the quantum ` evolution ' breaks down at @xmath927 .",
    "let us examine this issue .",
    "starting at @xmath928 for some large positive @xmath100 , and fixing values of @xmath929 and @xmath930 , one can use the equation to determine the coefficients @xmath931 for all @xmath932 , _ provided _ the coefficient of the highest order term in ( [ de1 ] ) continues to remain non - zero .",
    "now , it is easy to verify that the coefficient vanishes if and only if @xmath933 .",
    "thus , the coefficient @xmath934 remains undetermined . in its place ,",
    "one just obtains a consistency condition constraining the coefficients @xmath935 and @xmath936 .",
    "now , since @xmath937 remains undetermined , at first sight , it may appear that one can not ` evolve ' past the singularity , i.e. that the quantum evolution also breaks down at the big - bang .",
    "however , the main point is that this is _ not _ the case . for",
    ", the structure of the quantum scalar constraint is such that _ the coefficient @xmath938 just decouples from the rest_. this comes about because of two facts : i ) the minimally coupled matter hamiltonians annihilate @xmath939 @xcite ; and ii ) @xmath940 .",
    "thus , unlike in the classical theory , evolution does not stop at the singularity ; the difference equation ( [ de1 ] ) lets us ` evolve ' right through it . in this analysis , we started at @xmath941 because we wanted to test what happens if one encounters the singularity ` head on ' .",
    "if one begins at a generic @xmath853 , the ` discrete evolution ' determined by ( [ de1 ] ) just ` jumps ' over the classical singularity without encountering any subtleties .",
    "next , let us consider the space of solutions .",
    "an examination of the classical degrees of freedom suggests that the freedom in physical quantum states should correspond to two functions _ just _ of matter fields @xmath188 .",
    "the space of solutions to the hamiltonian constraint , on the other hand is much larger : there are as many solutions as there are functions @xmath921 on an interval @xmath942 , where @xmath943 is any fixed number .",
    "thus suggests that a large number of these solutions may be redundant . indeed , to complete the quantization procedure , one needs to introduce an appropriate inner product on the space of solutions to the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the physical hilbert space is then spanned by just those solutions to the quantum constraint which have finite norm . in simple examples",
    "one generally finds that , while the space of solutions to all constraints can be very large , the requirement of finiteness of norm suffices to produce a hilbert space of the physically expected size .",
    "for the reduced system considered here , one have a quantum mechanical system and with a single constraint in quantum cosmology .",
    "hence it should be possible to extract physical states using the group averaging technique of the ` refined algebraic framework ' @xcite .",

    "this issue is being investigated .",
    "to summarize , two factors were key to the resolution of the big bang singularity : i ) as a direct consequence of quantum geometry , the hamiltonian constraint is now a difference equation rather than a differential equation as in geometrodynamics ; and ii ) the coefficients in the difference equation are such that one can evolve unambiguously ` through ' the singularity even though the coefficient @xmath944 is undetermined . both these features are robust : they are largely insensitive to factor ordering ambiguities and persist in more complicated cosmological models @xcite .",
    "the qualitative changes introduced by quantum geometry in kinematics and dynamics are significant only in the planck regime .",
    "a careful analysis shows that the discrete evolution is extremely well approximated by the wheeler dewitt differential equation at scales larger than @xmath895 in a precise sense @xcite .",
    "thus the fundamental discreteness , characteristic of loop quantum gravity , intervenes in a subtle way precisely in the planck regime where geometrodynamics fails to resolve singularities . since loop quantum cosmology mimics the full theory as closely as possible , within the limitations discussed at the very beginning of section [ s7 ]",
    ", these results provide support for the approach to quantum dynamics in the full theory .",
    "loop quantum cosmology illuminates dynamical ramifications of quantum geometry but within the limited context of mini - superspaces where all but a finite number of degrees of freedom are frozen . in this section , we will discuss a complementary application where one considers the full theory but probes consequences of quantum geometry which are not sensitive to the details of how the hamiltonian constraint is imposed .",
    "( for further details , see @xcite . for early work ,",
    "see @xcite . )    as was explained in section [ s1 ] , since mid - seventies , a key question in the subject has been : what is the statistical mechanical origin of the black hole entropy @xmath945 ?",
    "what are the microscopic degrees of freedom that account for this entropy ?",
    "this relation implies that a solar mass black hole must have @xmath946 quantum states , a number that is _ huge _ even by the standards of statistical mechanics . where do all these states reside ? to answer these questions , in the early nineties wheeler @xcite had suggested the following heuristic picture , which he christened ` _ _ it _ _ from _ bit _ ' .",
    "divide the black hole horizon in to elementary cells , each with one planck unit of area , @xmath947 and assign to each cell two microstates",
    ". then the total number of states @xmath948 is given by @xmath949 where @xmath950 is the number of elementary cells , whence entropy is given by @xmath951 .",
    "thus , apart from a numerical coefficient , the entropy ( ` _ _ it _ _ ' ) is accounted for by assigning two states ( ` _ _ bit _ _ ' ) to each elementary cell .",
    "this qualitative picture is simple and attractive .",
    "thus , one is led to ask : can these heuristic ideas be supported by a systematic analysis from first principles ? what is the origin of the ` elementary cells ' ? why is each cell endowed with precisely two states ? and most importantly : _ what has all this to do with a black hole ? _",
    "the ` it from bit ' considerations seem to apply to any 2-surface !",
    "quantum geometry enables one to address all these issues in detail .",
    "the precise picture is much more involved : because the area spectrum is quite complicated in quantum geometry , ` elementary cells ' need not all carry the same area and the number of ` internal states ' of each cell is also not restricted to two .",
    "nonetheless , it does turn out that a dominant contribution in the entropy calculation comes from states envisaged by wheeler .",
    "the purpose of this section is to summarize the overall situation .",
    "our discussion is divided in to three parts . in the first",
    ", we recall the ` isolated horizon framework ' in classical general relativity which serves as a point of departure for quantum theory . in the second we discuss the quantum geometry of the simplest ( undistorted and non - rotating ) horizons and",
    "present the entropy calculation allowing for the presence of minimally coupled matter . in the third ,",
    "we discuss extensions that include non - minimal couplings , distortions and rotation .",
    "a systematic approach to the problem of entropy requires that we first specify the class of horizons of interest .",
    "since the entropy formula is expected to hold unambiguously for black holes in equilibrium , most analyses were confined to _",
    "stationary _ , eternal black holes ( i.e. , to the kerr - newman family in 4-dimensional general relativity ) . from a physical viewpoint",
    "however , this assumption seems overly restrictive .",
    "after all , in statistical mechanical calculations of entropy of ordinary systems , one only has to assume that the given system is in equilibrium , not the whole world .",
    "therefore , it should suffice for us to assume that the black hole itself is in equilibrium ; the exterior geometry should not be forced to be time - independent .",
    "furthermore , the analysis should also account for entropy of black holes which may be distorted or carry ( yang - mills and other ) hair .",
    "finally , it has been known since the mid - seventies that the thermodynamical considerations apply not only to black holes but also to cosmological horizons @xcite .",
    "a natural question arises : can these diverse situations be treated in a single stroke ? in classical general relativity , the isolated horizon framework provides a natural avenue by encompassing all these situations .",
    "it also provides a hamiltonian framework which serves as a natural point of departure for quantization @xcite    let us begin with the basic definitions @xcite . in this discussion",
    ", we need to begin with a 4-dimensional space - time manifold @xmath11 although we will return to 3-manifolds @xmath13 once we have a hamiltonian framework",
    ".    a _ non - expanding horizon _",
    "@xmath952 is a null , 3-dimensional sub - manifold of the 4-dimensional space - time @xmath953 , with topology @xmath954 , such that : + i ) the expansion @xmath955 of its null normal @xmath956 vanishes ; and , + ii ) field equations hold on @xmath952 with stress energy , @xmath957 , satisfying the very weak requirement that @xmath958 is a future - directed , causal vector .",
    "( throughout , @xmath959 will be assumed to be future pointing . )",
    "+ note that : i ) if the expansion vanishes for one null normal , it vanishes for all ; and , ii ) the condition on stress energy is satisfied by all the standard matter fields _ provided they are minimally coupled to gravity_.    the definition ensures that the area of any 2-sphere cross - section of the horizon is constant and matter flux across @xmath952 vanishes .",
    "it also implies that the space - time derivative operator @xmath15 naturally induces a unique derivative operator @xmath798 on @xmath952 .",
    "since @xmath952 is a null 3-surface , it has a degenerate intrinsic ` metric ' @xmath24 of signature 0,+,+ . the pair @xmath960 is referred to as _ the geometry _ of @xmath952 . the notion that the black hole itself is in equilibrium",
    "is captured by requiring that this geometry is time independent :    an _ isolated horizon _",

    "the isolated horizon definition extracts from the notion of the killing horizon just that ` tiny ' part which turns out to be essential for black hole mechanics and , more generally , to capture the notion that the horizon is in equilibrium , allowing for dynamical processes and radiation in the exterior region .",
    "indeed , einstein s equations admit solutions with isolated horizons in which there is radiation arbitrarily close to the horizons @xcite .",
    "note that in the definition uses conditions which are _ local _ to @xmath952 .",
    "thus , unlike event horizons , this notion is local , not ` teleological ' . for our purposes ,",
    "the two important considerations are : + i ) the definition is satisfied not only by event horizons of stationary black holes but also by the standard cosmological horizons .",
    "thus , all situations in which thermodynamical considerations apply are treated in one stroke .",
    "+ ii ) if one restricts oneself to space - times which admit an internal boundary which is an isolated horizon , _ the action principle and the hamiltonian description is well - defined _ and the resulting phase space has an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this would not be the case if one used general event horizons or killing horizons instead .",
    "next , let us examine symmetry groups of isolated horizons .",
    "a _ symmetry _ of @xmath964 is a space - time diffeomorphism which maps @xmath952 to itself ; at most rescales @xmath956 by a constant , and preserves @xmath111 and @xmath798 .",
    "it is clear the diffeomorphisms generated by any smooth extension of @xmath959 are symmetries .",
    "so , the symmetry group @xmath965 is at least 1-dimensional .",
    "the question is : are there any other symmetries ? at infinity , we generally have a universal symmetry group ( such as the poincar or the anti - de sitter ) because all metrics under consideration approach a fixed metric ( minkowskian or anti - de sitter ) there . in the case of the isolated horizons ,",
    "generically we are in the strong field regime and space - time metrics do not approach a universal metric .",
    "therefore , the symmetry group is not universal .",
    "however , there are only three universality classes : + i ) type i : the isolated horizon geometry is spherical ; in this case , @xmath965 is four dimensional ; + ii ) type ii : the isolated horizon geometry is axi - symmetric ; in this case , @xmath965 is two dimensional ; + iii ) type iii : the diffeomorphisms generated by @xmath959 are the only symmetries ; @xmath965 is one dimensional .",
    "note that these symmetries refer _ only to _ the horizon geometry .",
    "the full space - time metric need not admit any isometries even in a neighborhood of the horizon .",
    "physically , type ii horizons are the most interesting ones .",
    "they include the kerr - newman horizons as well as their generalizations incorporating distortions ( to due exterior matter of other black holes ) and hair .",
    "the zeroth and the first laws of black hole mechanics can be naturally extended to type ii isolated horizons @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the einstein - maxwell theory , one can define the mass @xmath966 and angular momentum @xmath967 of the horizon using only the intrinsic geometry of the isolated horizon and show that the first law holds : m_= a _",
    "+ j_+ q_where @xmath968 are , respectively , the surface gravity , angular velocity and the electric potential at the horizon and @xmath969 denotes the exterior derivative on the ( infinite dimensional ) phase space .",
    "this law of isolated horizon mechanics encompasses all black holes and cosmological horizons in equilibrium , including the ones which arbitrary distortion and rotation .",
    "let us first discuss type i isolated horizons in detail and then generalize the results to include non - minimally coupled matter and type ii horizons .",
    "we will divide the type i discussion in to three parts . in the first ,",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian formulation ; in the second , we describe the quantum horizon geometry ; and in the third , we summarize the entropy calculation .",
    "consider the sector of general relativity consisting of gravitational and matter fields for which the underlying space - time admits an internal boundary which is a type i isolated horizon @xmath952 _ with a fixed area _",
    ". we will focus on geometrical structures near @xmath952 and on the modifications of the hamiltonian framework of section [ s2 ] caused by the presence of an internal boundary .",
    "denote by @xmath7 the 2-sphere intersection of the ( partial ) cauchy surface @xmath13 with the isolated horizon @xmath952 .",
    "introduce on @xmath952 an internal vector field @xmath970 , i.e. any isomorphism from the unit 2-sphere in the lie algebra of @xmath184 to @xmath7 and partially gauge fix the internal @xmath184 freedom to @xmath971 by requiring that @xmath972 , where @xmath973 is the unit normal to @xmath7",
    ". then it turns out that _ the intrinsic geometry of @xmath952 is completely determined by the pull - back @xmath974 to @xmath7 of the connection @xmath975 on @xmath23 _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath976 is in fact a spin - connection intrinsic to the 2-sphere @xmath7 : @xmath977 on @xmath7 ( see ( [ pa ] ) .",
    "thus , if we consider orthonormal dyads @xmath978 on @xmath7 with internal rotation freedom in @xmath979 , @xmath976 is a connection on the corresponding @xmath980 bundle .",

    ". this fact will be useful in the discussion of the symplectic structure . ) finally , the fact that @xmath7 is ( the intersection of @xmath23 with ) a type i isolated horizon is captured in a relation between the two canonically conjugate fields : [ bc1 ] f : = dw= - 8 g ^i r_i .where @xmath985 is the pull - back to @xmath7 of the 2-forms @xmath986 on @xmath13 , dual to the momentum @xmath152 .",
    "thus , because of the isolated horizon boundary conditions , fields which would otherwise be independent are now related .",
    "as one would expect , the boundary conditions _ reduce _ the number of independent fields ; in particular , the pull - backs to @xmath7 of the canonically conjugate fields @xmath987 are completely determined by the @xmath980 connection @xmath976 .",
    "the main modification in the hamiltonian framework of section [ s2 ] is that the gravitational symplectic structure now acquires a surface term : [ sym2 ] * * ( _ 1 , _ 2 ) = -_m tr ( _ 1 a _ 2 - _ 2 a _ 1 ) + _ s _ 1 w _ 2 w , where , as in section [ s2 ] , @xmath988 denote tangent vectors to the phase space @xmath816 . since @xmath976 is essentially the only ` free data ' on the horizon , it is not surprising that the surface term of the symplectic structure is expressible entirely in terms of @xmath976 .",
    "however , it is interesting and somewhat surprising that the new surface term is precisely the symplectic structure of the @xmath980-chern simons theory .",
    "_ the symplectic structures of the maxwell , yang - mills , scalar and dilatonic fields do not acquire surface terms .",
    "_ conceptually , this is an important point : this , in essence , is the reason why ( for minimally coupled matter ) the black hole entropy depends just on the area and not , in addition , on the matter charges .      in the classical theory ,",
    "the bulk fields determine the surface fields just by continuity ; there are no _ independent _ degrees of freedom on the surface in the classical phase space . in the quantum theory ,",
    "on the other hand the fields are distributional and arbitrarily discontinuous whence the surface and the bulk fields effectively decouple .",
    "it is this phenomenon that is responsible for creating ` independent surface states ' in the quantum theory .",
    "the main task is to extend the ` bulk ' quantum geometry of sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] to allow for the presence of an internal boundary @xmath7 .",
    "now , the space of generalized connections @xmath227 is a product @xmath989 , where a volume generalized connection @xmath990 assigns an @xmath184 element to any ( closed - piecewise analytic ) edge lying in the bulk while @xmath991 assigns an @xmath992 element to each ( closed - piecewise analytic ) edge lying in the surface @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to begin with a total hilbert space @xmath993 where @xmath994 is built from suitable functions of generalized connections in the bulk and @xmath856 from suitable functions of generalized surface connections .",
    "the volume hilbert space @xmath994 is the one that comes from bulk quantum geometry of section [ s4 ] : @xmath995 .",
    "the question is : what would be the surface hilbert space ?",
    "the answer is suggested by the structure of the surface term in the symplectic structure : it should be the hilbert space of chern - simons theory on the horizon .",
    "furthermore , the coefficient in front of this surface term tells us that the quantum chern - simons theory must have a ( dimensionless ) coupling constant / level @xmath894 given by : [ level ] k = but we also have to incorporate the boundary condition ( [ bc1 ] ) _ which ensures that @xmath7 is not any old 2-surface but an isolated horizon_. the _ key _ idea is to impose it quantum mechanically , _ as an operator equation _ on @xmath209 , i.e. via [ qbc](1 ) = - 8g(r)1 ) , where the notation emphasizes that @xmath996 is a _ surface _ operator while @xmath997 is an operator on the _ volume _ hilbert space . it is easy to show that a basis of solutions is given by states of the type @xmath998 where @xmath999 is an eigenstate of the volume operator , @xmath1000 an eigenstate of the surface operator with _ same _ eigenvalues .",
    "now , all the eigenvalues of the bulk operator on the right side of ( [ qbc ] ) are known from bulk quantum geometry of section [ s4.3.4 ] ( see ( [ esf1 ] ) .",
    "they are given by : [ triadevs ] - ( ) ( 8 ^ 2 _",
    "i m_i ^3(x , p_i ) _ ab ) , where @xmath1001 are half integers , the sum ranges over a finite set of points called punctures on @xmath7 and where @xmath1002 is the metric independent levi - civita density on @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the quantum boundary condition ( [ qbc ] ) tells us that @xmath856 should be the hilbert space of @xmath980-chern - simons theory on a punctured 2-sphere @xmath7 where the curvature @xmath1003 has the form of a @xmath817-distribution concentrated at a finite number of punctures .",
    "let us then begin by fixing a set @xmath1004 of punctures on @xmath7 and consider @xmath992-chern - simons theory on this punctured sphere .",
    "the phase space of this theory is @xmath1005 where @xmath1006 is the space of connections which is flat everywhere except at the punctures ; @xmath1007 is the space of local @xmath992 gauge transformations which are identity except at the punctures ; @xmath1008 is the space of diffeomorphisms of @xmath7 which fix the punctures and certain structure at the punctures ; and @xmath1009 stands for semi - direct product .",
    "this phase space is isomorphic with the torus @xmath1010 if there are @xmath198 punctures in the set @xmath1004 , equipped with the natural symplectic structure on @xmath1010 . a convenient set of canonically conjugate coordinates can be introduced as follows .",
    "let us fix the @xmath198th puncture as ` origin ' and , as in fig [ entropyfig1 ] , denote by @xmath1011 , a family of curves joining the @xmath507th puncture to the @xmath198th , ( with @xmath1012 ) and by @xmath1013 , ` small ' closed loops surrounding each of the first @xmath1014 punctures .",
    "then , for each @xmath507 , two holonomies around @xmath1011 and @xmath1013 are canonically conjugate .",
    "this phase space is often referred to as the _ non - commutative torus_.    the hilbert space @xmath1015 of surface states results from geometric quantization of this torus @xcite .",
    "this is the space of quantum states of the @xmath980 chern - simons theory on @xmath1016 .",
    "the total surface hilbert space @xmath856 is the inductive limit of these hilbert spaces as the set @xmath1004 becomes larger and larger . as discussed in section [ s4 ] ,",
    "the volume hilbert space @xmath1017 can also be obtained as the inductive limit of the hilbert spaces @xmath1018 associated with graphs @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "next one has to impose the quantum boundary condition ( [ qbc ] ) .",
    "_ this introduces a highly non - trivial test of the whole framework .",
    "_ construction of the surface hilbert space was strongly motivated by ( [ qbc ] ) .",
    "however , now that it is complete , there is no more freedom . in the chern - simons hilbert space",
    ", one can compute the eigenvalues of the surface operator @xmath996 .",
    "this calculation is _ completely independent _ of the volume hilbert space ; it has never heard of the quantum geometry in the bulk .",
    "the _ key _",
    "question on which everything hinges is : are the eigenvalues of @xmath996 the same as the eigenvalues ( [ triadevs ] ) of the bulk operator in ( [ qbc ] ) ? if not , there will be no solutions to the quantum boundary conditions !",
    "the remarkable fact is that _ the infinite set of eigenvalues of the two operators match _ , even though the two calculations are completely distinct .",
    "this comes about because the level of the chern - simons theory is related to the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath44 and the area @xmath1019 in a very specific way , which in turn is a consequence of the isolated horizon boundary conditions .",
    "thus there is a seamless matching between three completely independent theories : the isolated horizon framework in classical general relativity ; the bulk quantum geometry ; and , the chern - simons theory on the punctured horizon .",
    "and this matching provides a coherent mathematical description of the quantum geometry of the horizon .        finally , one has to impose quantum einstein s equations .",
    "the gauss constraint asks that the total state @xmath1020 should be gauge invariant .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint asks that diffeomorphisms on @xmath7 should be regarded as gauge .",
    "again there are important mathematical subtleties .",
    "but the final picture is simple .",
    "while each of the bulk and the surface states transforms non - trivially under the remaining gauge freedom ( @xmath1021 ) , the total state is gauge invariant as needed .",
    "implementation of the remaining diffeomorphism constraint ( corresponding to @xmath1022 ) asks that what matters is only the number of punctures ; their location is irrelevant .",
    "is well - defined ; @xmath996 itself is not .",
    "therefore , the mathematically meaningful quantum boundary condition is the exponentiated version of ( [ qbc ] ) .",
    "ii ) the @xmath980 gauge group at the punctures is replaced by the quantum @xmath980 group .",
    "the deformation parameter is supplied by the level @xmath894 of the chern - simons theory which is required to be an integer because of the pe - quantization requirements .",
    "this also implies that the deficit angles at each puncture are quantized .",
    "iii ) recall that one has to fix certain structure at the punctures in the construction of the surface hilbert space . under @xmath1023 ,",
    "this structure changes .",
    "therefore , strictly , to begin with one has infinitely many copies of the surface hilbert spaces , one for each choice of the extra structure and the fact that @xmath1023 is gauge implies that only one of these copies is physically relevant .",
    "that is , the fact that diffeomorphisms in @xmath1022 are gauge is incorporated by ` gauge fixing ' . ] the hamiltonian constraint , by contrast does not restrict the surface states , i.e. , the quantum geometry of the horizon .",
    "this is because in the classical theory , the constraint is functionally differentiable ( i.e. generates gauge ) only when the smearing function ( the lapse ) goes to zero on the isolated horizon boundary ( and , as usual , at infinity ) .",
    "the time - evolution along the isolated horizon is generated by a _",
    "true hamiltonian _ , not just the constraint .",
    "let us summarize .",
    "the physical surface hilbert space @xmath1024 is given by @xmath1025 , with @xmath1026 , the hilbert space of the @xmath992 chern - simons theory on the sphere @xmath7 with @xmath198 punctures , where the polymer excitations of the bulk geometry intersect @xmath7 .",
    "( see fig [ entropyfig2 ] ) .",
    "let us focus on @xmath1026 . since @xmath976 is the intrinsic spin - connection on @xmath7 and since @xmath1003 vanishes except at the punctures , the intrinsic geometry of the quantum horizon is flat except at the @xmath198 punctures .",
    "the @xmath1027-holonomies around these punctures are non - trivial , whence the punctures carry deficit angles which , furthermore , are quantized .",
    "they add up to @xmath1028 , providing a quantum analog of the gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "_ remarks _ : i ) note that the above analysis makes a crucial use of the horizon boundary condition ; it is not applicable to a general 2-surface .",
    "thus the most important limitation of wheeler s ` it from bit ' considerations is overcome .",
    "the strategy of incorporating the boundary condition through an _ operator equation _ ( [ qbc ] ) allows both the connection @xmath976 and the triad @xmath1029 to fluctuate and requires only that they do so in tandem .",
    "this equation provides the first step in the answer to the question : what is a quantum black hole ?",
    "\\ii ) for extensions of this framework to include non - minimally coupled fields and type ii horizons ( discussed in section [ s8.3 ] ) , let us note that there are just three essential mathematical ingredients which serve as the input for this construction of the surface hilbert space : a ) the form of the surface term in ( [ sym2 ] ) which shows that the surface symplectic structure is that of the @xmath992-chern - simons theory with level @xmath894 of ( [ level ] ) ; b ) the horizon boundary condition ( [ bc1 ] ) ; and c ) the spectrum ( [ triadevs ] ) of the triad operator @xmath1030 .      in the classical theory , @xmath1019 in the expression of the surface term of the symplectic structure ( [ sym2 ] ) and in the boundary condition ( [ bc1 ] ) is the horizon area .",
    "however in the _ quantum theory _ , @xmath1019 has simply been a parameter so far ; we have not tied it to the _ physical area of the horizon_. to calculate entropy , one has to construct a suitable ` micro - canonical ' ensemble by relating @xmath909 to the physical area .",
    "it follows from the definition of volume connections that , as depicted in fig [ entropyfig2 ] , the polymer excitations of the bulk geometry puncture the horizon _ transversely _ from the ` exterior ' .",
    "hence , the relevant area eigenvalues are those given in ( [ rev ] ) : @xmath1031 therefore , one is led to construct the micro - canonical ensemble by considering only that sub - space of the bulk theory which , at the horizon , satisfies : [ micro1 ] a_o -8 ^ 2 _ i a_o + where @xmath507 ranges over the number of punctures , @xmath1032 is the spin label ( the eigenvalue of the vertex operator @xmath1033 associated with the puncture @xmath1034 ) , and @xmath1035 . in presence of matter fields carrying charges , one fixes values of horizon charges",
    "@xmath1036 ( labelled by @xmath211 ) and restrict the matter configurations so that [ micro2 ] q_o^ ( ) -^ ( ) q_o^ ( ) q_o^ ( ) + ^()for suitably chosen @xmath1037 . ( as is usual in statistical mechanics , the leading contribution to the entropy is independent of the precise choice of these small intervals . ) now , the physical states belonging to this ensemble contain information also about gravitational and electromagnetic radiation far away from the horizon which is obviously irrelevant to the calculation of black hole entropy . what is relevant are the states directly associated with the horizon of a given area @xmath909 , and charges @xmath1038 .",
    "one is therefore led to trace over the volume degrees of freedom and construct a density matrix @xmath1039 describing a maximum entropy mixture of surface satisfying ( [ micro1 ] ) and ( [ micro2 ] ) .",
    "the statistical mechanical entropy is then given by @xmath1040 ) .",
    "as usual , this number can be calculated simply by counting states : s_= _ where @xmath1041 is the number of chern - simons surface states consistent with the area and charge constraints . a detailed analysis @xcite ,",
    "estimates this number and leads to the expression of entropy of large black holes : [ entropy ] s _ : = _",
    "= + o ( ) , _ o = thus , ignoring terms @xmath1042 , entropy is indeed proportional to the horizon area .",
    "however , even for large black holes , one obtains agreement with the hawking - bekenstein formula _ only _ in the sector of quantum geometry in which the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath44 takes the value @xmath1043 .",
    "thus , while all @xmath44 sectors are equivalent classically , the standard quantum field theory in curved space - times is recovered in the semi - classical theory only in the @xmath1044 sector of quantum geometry .",
    "it is quite remarkable that thermodynamical considerations involving _ large _ black holes can be used to fix the quantization ambiguity which dictates such planck scale properties as eigenvalues of geometric operators .",
    "now , the value of @xmath44 can be fixed by demanding agreement with the semi - classical result just in one case e.g .",
    ", a spherical horizon with zero charge , or a cosmological horizon in the de sitter space - time , or ,  . once the value of @xmath44 is fixed , the theory is completely fixed and one can ask : does this theory yield the hawking - bekenstein value of entropy of _ all _ isolated horizons , irrespective of the values of charges , angular momentum , and cosmological constant , the amount of distortion , or hair .",
    "the non - trivial fact is that the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "thus , the agreement with quantum field theory in curved space - times holds in _ all _ these diverse cases .",
    "physical interpretation of @xmath1045 is that it represents the entropy that observers in the ` external region ' ( used in the construction of the phase space ) associate to the horizon .",
    "why does @xmath1044 not depend on other quantities such as charges ? as noted in section [ s8.2.2 ] ,",
    "only the gravitational part of the symplectic structure develops a surface term at the horizon ; the matter symplectic structures have only volume terms .",
    "( furthermore , the gravitational surface term is insensitive to the value of the cosmological constant . ) consequently , there are no independent surface quantum states associated with matter .",
    "this provides a natural ` explanation ' of the fact that the hawking - bekenstein entropy depends only on the horizon geometry and is independent of electro - magnetic ( or other ) charges ( of minimally coupled matter fields ) .",
    "finally , let us return to wheeler s ` it from bit ' .",
    "one can ask : what are the states that dominate the counting ? perhaps not surprisingly , they turn out to be the ones which assign to each puncture the smallest quantum of area ( i.e. , spin value @xmath1046 ) , thereby maximizing the number of punctures . in these states ,",
    "each puncture defines wheeler s ` elementary cell ' and his two states correspond to whether the deficit angle is positive or negative .",
    "to summarize , quantum geometry naturally provides the micro - states responsible for the huge entropy associated with horizons . in this analysis ,",
    "all black holes and cosmological horizons are treated in an unified fashion ; there is no restriction , e.g. , to near - extremal black holes .",
    "the sub - leading term has also been calculated and shown to be proportional to @xmath1047 @xcite .",
    "finally , in this analysis quantum einstein s equations _ are _ used . in particular , had the quantum gauss and co - vector / diffeomorphism constraints not been imposed on surface states , the spurious gauge degrees of freedom would have given an infinite entropy . however , because of the isolated horizon boundary conditions , the scalar / hamiltonian constraint has to be imposed just in the bulk . since in the entropy calculation one traces over bulk states , the final result is insensitive to the details of how this ( or any other bulk ) equation is imposed .",
    "thus , as in other approaches to black hole entropy , the calculation does not require a complete knowledge of quantum dynamics .",
    "we will now show that , while the introduction of non - minimal couplings @xcite and distortion and rotation @xcite does introduce interesting modifications , the qualitative picture of section [ s8.2 ] remains unaltered .",
    "consider a scalar field @xmath188 non - minimally coupled to gravity through the action [ g_ab , ] = d^4x [ action1 ] where @xmath241 is a nowhere vanishing function ( minimal coupling results if @xmath1048 ) and @xmath1049 is the potential .",
    "now the stress energy tensor does not satisfy even the weak energy requirement ii ) in the definition of a non - expanding horizon .",
    "however , one can replace it by : + ii) field equations hold on @xmath952 and the scalar field @xmath188 satisfies @xmath1050 on @xmath952 .",

    "( for minimal couplings , time independence of matter fields on @xmath952 is ensured by ii ) . )",
    "the isolated horizon framework then leads to the zeroth and first laws @xcite .",
    "however , now the form of the first law is modified : m = [ _ s f ( ) d^2v_s ] + j_suggesting that the entropy should be given by : s_= _ s f ( ) d^2v .",
    "( the same conclusion is reached using the general framework of @xcite which deals with a broad class of theories but which requires a globally defined killing field with a bifurcate killing horizon . )",
    "the question now is : can the statistical mechanical derivation of entropy of [ s8.2 ] , based on quantum geometry , go through also in this case ?",
    "this is a non - trivial check on the robustness of that framework , first because the seamless matching between chern - simons theory and bulk geometry required for a coherent description of the quantum horizon geometry is very delicate , and second , because the entropy now depends not only on geometry but also on the scalar field . in spite of these non - trivialities ,",
    "the framework does turn out to be robust .    for type i horizons , as one would expect , @xmath188 is constant on @xmath7 .",
    "let us consider the sector of the phase space consisting of fields for which @xmath952 is a type i horizon with fixed area @xmath909 and scalar field @xmath1051 .",
    "then , the main modifications of the discussion of [ s8.2 ] , caused by the non - minimal coupling , are the following : + i ) denote by @xmath1052 the momentum conjugate to the gravitational connection @xmath151 .",
    "if we only have minimally coupled matter , @xmath1053 and the geometrical triad @xmath1054 is given by @xmath1055 ( see ( [ p ] ) ) . with non - minimal coupling ,",
    "the geometrical triad involves _ both _",
    "@xmath1052 _ and _ the scalar field : @xmath1056 .",
    "conceptually , this is an important change because quantum geometry is now dictated not just by the gravitational variables @xmath1057 but also involves the matter variable @xmath188 .",
    "+ ii ) the geometrical relation between the pulled back triad and the gravitational connection on the horizon remains unaltered .",
    "therefore , in terms of the phase space variables , the boundary condition ( [ bc1 ] ) is now replaced by : [ bc2 ] f : = dw= - 8 g ^i r_i .where @xmath1058 is now the pull - back to @xmath7 of the dual @xmath1059 of the gravitational momentum .",
    "+ iii ) the surface term in the symplectic structure is again given by that of the @xmath992 chern - simons theory but the level is modified : [ level2 ] k = iv ) since the description of the bulk hilbert space in terms of the gravitational momentum variables remains unaltered , the eigenvalues of the gravitational momentum operator @xmath1060 continue to given by ( [ triadevs ] ) : [ triadevs2 ] - ( ) ( 8 ^ 2 _",
    "i m_i ^3(x , p_i ) _ ab ) , v ) finally , for the 2-surface @xmath7 , the area eigenvalues are now given by : [ rev2 ] _ i . in place of ( [ rev ] ) .",
    "thus , in the key equations , @xmath909 is just replaced by @xmath1061 everywhere .",
    "one can now repeat the analysis of section [ s8.2 ] ( using the  polymer representation also of the scalar field @xcite . )",
    "equations ( [ bc2 ] ) , ( [ level2 ] ) and ( [ rev2 ] ) now imply that the quantum boundary condition does have ` enough ' solutions : although the level of the chern - simons theory and the boundary condition are both modified , the delicate interplay between the surface and the volume sectors required for a coherent theory of the geometry of quantum horizons survives in tact .",
    "the state counting procedure can be repeated and ( [ rev2 ] ) now implies that the entropy is given by : [ entropy2 ] s _ : = = + o ( ) , _ o = .",
    "thus , if @xmath1062 , one obtains the answer suggested by the classical analysis . note that the value @xmath1063 of the barbero - immirzi parameter is the _ same _ as it was for minimally coupled matter fields .",
    "let us now extend the framework of section [ s8.1 ] to type ii horizons @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the _ type ii problem can be mapped on to the type i problem _ already at the classical level .",
    "thus , in the quantum theory , the underlying mathematics will be the same as that in the type i case .",
    "however , the physical meaning of the chern - simons connection on the boundary will be different . as is usual when one maps a given , complicated problem to a mathematically simpler one , the physical non - trivialities are contained in the map . in the present case",
    "it is the map that carries all the information about distortion and angular momentum .    for brevity ,",
    "let us focus just on the gravitational sector and ignore other fields on @xmath952 .",
    "the ` free data ' on type ii isolated horizon is again determined by an @xmath992 connection @xmath1064 on @xmath7",
    ". however , now the connection also has the information about distortion and angular momentum : @xmath1065 , where @xmath1066 is a real @xmath992 connection on the spin - bundle over @xmath7 which now carries information about distortion and @xmath1067 is a globally defined , real - valued 1-form on @xmath7 which carries information about angular momentum ( see([pa ] ) .",
    "the gauge and diffeomorphism invariant characterization of the free data @xmath19 can be coded in a pair , @xmath1068 of mass and angular momentum multipoles @xcite . in the type",
    "i case , @xmath1069 is the mass and all other horizon multipoles vanish . in the type ii case , @xmath1069 is again the mass , @xmath1070 continues to vanish , @xmath1071 is the angular momentum and higher multipoles represent departures from sphericity .",
    "the @xmath1072 and @xmath1073 have the interpretation of ` source multipoles ' of the black hole .",
    "recall from section [ s8.1 ] that two ingredients from the classical theory play the key role in quantization : the isolated horizon boundary condition ( [ bc1 ] ) and the surface term in the symplectic structure ( [ sym2 ] ) .",
    "now , ( [ bc1 ] ) is replaced by : [ bc3 ] f : = dv = f 8g^i r_i the major difference from the type i case is that @xmath241 is _ not a constant but a genuine function on _ @xmath7 ( determined by the newman - penrose component @xmath226 of ) the weyl curvature .",
    "similarly , while the symplectic structure does have a surface term which is fully determined by the surface connection @xmath19 , it is _ not _ the chern - simons symplectic structure for @xmath19 .",
    "so , at first , the situation appears to be quite different from that in the type i case .",
    "however , one can in fact map the present problem to the type i problem which was already solved . to see this ,",
    "note first that if one is interested in any one macroscopic black hole , one has to fix its macroscopic parameters . in the globally vacuum context of classical general relativity , for example",
    ", one would fix the mass ( or the horizon area ) and the angular momentum . in the present , very general discussion of isolated horizons",
    ", we have allowed arbitrary distortions .",
    "therefore , to fix the macroscopic black hole , one has to fix all multipole moments @xmath1074 .",
    "the type i phase space can also be constructed my fixing all multipoles ( now @xmath1075 and all other multipoles zero ) .",
    "hence , one would intuitively expect that this sector is ` of the same size ' as the type i sector .",
    "however , is this really the case ? more importantly , do the arguments that one should be considering a _ chern - simons theory on a punctured 2-sphere _ go through ?",
    "the answer to both questions turns out to be in the affirmative : one can explicitly coordinatize the type ii surface phase space @xmath1076 with a new @xmath992 connection @xmath976 on the spin - bundle over @xmath7 such that the surface symplectic structure @xmath1077 is given by : [ sym5 ] * * _ s(_1 , _ 2 ) = _ s _ 1 w _ 2 w . and the curvature of @xmath976 is given by : [ w ] dw = - 8 g ^ir_i thus , the sector of the surface phase space corresponding to any fixed set of multipoles on a type ii horizon is isomorphic with the phase space of a type i horizon",
    ". moreover , the horizon boundary condition in the type ii case ( when expressed in terms of @xmath976 ) are identical to those in the type i case . therefore in terms of the surface connection @xmath976 ,",
    "one can proceed with quantization as we did before in the type i case .",
    "all mathematics underlying the quantum horizon geometry and the state counting is the same !",
    "however , the physical meaning of symbols and constructions is different . in particular , in the type i case , @xmath976 was the natural spin connection which directly described the horizon geometry and therefore the punctures where its curvature is concentrated could be directly associated with deficit angles . in the present case ,",
    "it is the connection @xmath19 that determines the physical horizon geometry and not @xmath976 and the relation between the two involves distortion and rotation .",
    "classically , this non - trivial information is coded in multipole moments of @xmath19 . on the quantum hilbert space",
    ", one can introduce the multipole moment operators and their eigenvalues distinguish the physical situation of interest , coded in @xmath19 , from the physics of the fiducial connection @xmath976 .",
    "thus , there are non - trivial differences on issues related to interpretation .",
    "however , the counting argument of [ s8.3 ] is unaffected by these .    to summarize , one can treat generic type ii isolated horizons via following steps : i ) construct parameters ( the multipoles ) which characterize these horizons in an invariant fashion macroscopically ( i.e. in the classical theory ) ; and , ii ) introduce an isomorphism from the phase space of horizons of interest to that of type i horizons , which maps the physical isolated horizon condition to the horizon condition in the type i case .",
    "together , these properties enable us to construct the quantum theory of horizon geometry and count the horizon states . _",
    "the procedure guarantees that the value of the barbero - immirzi parameter that reproduces the hawking bekenstein formula for large black holes is the same as that used in the type i case , independent of the values of the mass and angular momentum multipoles . _",
    "the value is thus robust .",
    "finally , note that because this analysis incorporates arbitrary distortions , we are going well beyond the kerr - newman family .",
    "the method encompasses a vast class of astrophysically realistic black holes .",
    "in the last six sections , we presented a self - contained summary of the quantum geometry framework and its physical applications which have been worked out in detail . in this section",
    ", we turn to current research .",
    "there are two major thrusts : i ) recovery of low energy physics through semi - classical quantum geometries ; and , ii ) spin foam models , which provide a ` sum over histories ' approach based on quantum geometry .",
    "since these are frontier areas , a finished physical picture is yet to emerge .",
    "therefore , our discussion will be briefer .",
    "a basic premise of loop quantum gravity is that there should be no background fields ; everything , including space - time geometry is dynamical and treated quantum mechanically from the start .",
    "however , of necessity , a background independent description must use physical concepts and mathematical tools that are quite different from those normally used in low energy quantum physics which is rooted in classical , minkowskian geometry .",
    "a major challenge , then , is to show that this low energy description does arise from the pristine , planckian world in an appropriate sense .",
    "this challenge is now being met step by step , although one is still far from reaching the final goal .",
    "let us begin by listing some of the main issues and questions .",
    "loop quantum gravity is based on _ quantum geometry _ , the essential discreteness of which permeates all constructions and results .",
    "the fundamental excitations are 1-dimensional and polymer - like",
    ". a convenient basis of states is provided by spin networks .",
    "low energy physics , on the other hand , is based on quantum field theories which are rooted in a flat space continuum .",
    "the fundamental excitations of these fields are 3-dimensional , typically representing wavy undulations on the background minkowskian geometry .",
    "the convenient fock - basis is given by specifying the occupation number in one particle states labelled by momenta and helicities . at first sight , the two frameworks seem disparate . _",
    "what then is the precise sense in which the fock states are to arise in the low energy limit of the full theory ?",
    "_    from a mathematical physics perspective , the basic variables of quantum geometry are holonomies ( or wilson loops ) of the gravitational connection @xmath124 along 1-dimensional curves and fluxes of the conjugate momenta ( the triads ) @xmath825 across 2-surfaces . in the final quantum theory , the connection @xmath124 fails to be a well - defined operator(-valued distribution )",
    "; only the holonomies are well - defined . in perturbative quantum field theories , by contrast , the vector potential operators are distributions , whence , a priori , their holonomies fail to be well - defined operators .",
    "similarly , fluxes of electric field operators across 2-surfaces fail to be well - defined on the fock space of photons .",
    "heuristically , then , it would appear that , even at a kinematic level , loop quantum gravity describes a ` phase ' of gauge theories which is distinct from the one used in electrodynamics . since it is generally believed that distinct phases carry distinct physics , it is natural to ask : _ is the well - tested , macroscopic ` coulomb phase ' of low energy gravity compatible at all with the planck scale discreteness of quantum geometry ? _ if so , in what sense ?",
    "how does it emerge from loop quantum gravity ?",
    "so far these issues have been analyzed through simple examples , where the focus is on constructing mathematical and conceptual tools that will be ultimately necessary for the systematic analysis of quantum fields on semi - classical states of quantum geometry @xcite .      in non - relativistic quantum mechanics ,",
    "one generally begins with the weyl algebra generated by operators @xmath1078 and @xmath1079 and seeks representations in which @xmath1080 and @xmath1081 are represented by 1-parameter family of unitary operators which are weakly continuous in @xmath642 and @xmath208 .",
    "the von neumann uniqueness theorem tells us that every irreducible representation of this algebra is isomorphic with the schrdinger representation .",
    "therefore , one typically develops the theory using just this representation .",
    "however , if one drops the requirement of weak continuity , say in @xmath208 , new representations become available .",
    "specifically , there is one in which states @xmath1082 are almost periodic functions of @xmath1083 . in this representation ,",
    "operators @xmath1084 are unitary as desired but the self - adjoint generator of @xmath1081 , which provides the momentum operator in the schrdinger representation , fails to exist .",
    "the position operator @xmath251 , on the other hand , does exist and is self - adjoint .",
    "furthermore , its spectrum is discrete in the sense that all its eigenvectors are normalizable .",
    "this representation is referred to as ` polymer particle ' because of its close mathematical similarities with the ` polymer ' representation of the algebra generated by holonomies and electric fluxes introduced in section [ s4 ] .",
    "( indeed , the underlying mathematical framework is the same as that used in quantum cosmology in section [ s7 ] , but the physical interpretations are very different . )",
    "@xmath251 is analogous to the electric flux operators and its eigenstates provide us with analogs of spin network states .",
    "@xmath1081 is analogous to the holonomies . just as the connection operator does not exist in quantum geometry ,",
    "the generator of space translations -the momentum operator of the schrdinger theory does not exist on the hilbert space @xmath1085 of the polymer particle representation .",
    "while the absence of the standard momentum operator is alarming from the perspective of non - relativistic quantum mechanics , _ heuristically _ it can be thought of as arising from a fundamental discreteness of spatial geometry .",
    "however , this motivation can not be taken too literally : non - relativistic quantum mechanics has limitations which become manifest _ much _ before quantum gravity discreteness can become significant .",
    "rather , the primary motivation in this study is mathematical : we have a simple toy model to probe the questions raised in the beginning of this section . in this analogy ,",
    "schrdinger quantum mechanics plays the role of quantum theories used in low energy physics and the main question is : can the polymer particle framework reproduce the results of schrdinger quantum mechanics , in spite of the fact that the two descriptions are fundamentally so different ?",
    "the answer is in the affirmative and the analysis has provided some conceptual and technical insight to recover low energy physics from the planck scale framework based on polymer geometry .",
    "main results @xcite can be summarized as follows :    although the standard creation and annihilation operators fail to be well - defined in @xmath1085 , their exponentials _ are _ well - defined and can be used to construct coherent states purely in the polymer framework .",
    "as one might expect of semi - classical states , they belong to @xmath1086 , the analog of @xmath487 of quantum geometry .",
    "a key question is whether they can be regarded as semi - classical states . at first",
    "this appears to be difficult because @xmath1086 does not carry a hermitian inner product .",
    "however , one _ can _ provide a meaningful criterion of semi - classicality through a notion of _ shadow states _",
    "( explained in section [ s9.1.2 ] ) and verify that these coherent states satisfy the criterion .    as in quantum cosmology , by introducing a length scale @xmath420 which is thought of as arising from the fundamental discreteness of spatial geometry , one can define a momentum operator and the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian using @xmath1081 : @xmath1087\\ , .\\ ] ] with @xmath1088 , where @xmath229 is the smallest length scale in the problem .",
    ", which , for the vibrational modes of a co molecule is @xmath1089 .",
    "since laboratory experiments show no signature of discreteness at the @xmath1090 scale , it is safe to take @xmath1091 the schrdinger equation then reduces to a difference equation . for the case of the harmonic oscillator , one can transform it to the well - known mathieu equation and , using the rather large body of results on this equation , show that all energy eigenstates are non - degenerate and eigenvalues discrete , given by : @xmath1092 thus the ` polymer corrections ' to the schrdinger eigenvalues become significant only when @xmath1093 ! using the notion of shadow states , one can also show that that there is a precise sense in which the eigenvectors are ` close ' to the schrdinger eigenvectors .",
    "since in the final picture one is in effect using a discrete approximation to the schrdinger equation , it may seem ` obvious ' that a close agreement with schrdinger quantum mechanics must occur .",
    "however , the detailed analysis contains a number of subtleties and the agreement emerges only when these subtleties are handled appropriately @xcite .",
    "more importantly , one does not simply begin with the schrdinger equation and discretize it ` by hand ' .",
    "rather , one follows procedures that are natural from the ` polymer ' perspective and arrive at the discrete substitute of the schrdinger equation .",
    "thus , polymer particle has turned out to be a simple toy model to illustrate how the gap between inequivalent mathematical frameworks can be bridged and how they can lead to physically equivalent results in the ` low energy regime ' in spite of the deep conceptual and structural differences at a fundamental level .",
    "the next two models that have been studied in detail are the maxwell field and linearized gravity in minkowski space - time @xcite .",
    "since our goal is to only to provide a bird s eye view , we will focus the main discussion on the maxwell case and return to linearized gravity at the end .    following the general procedures outlined in section [ s4 ] to the case when the gauge group @xmath27 is @xmath992",
    ", one can construct a ` polymer representation ' of the maxwell field ( see appendix [ a1 ] .",
    "polymer representations were first introduced by buchholz and fredenhagen in a different context . )",
    "the goal is to understand its relation to the standard fock representation of photons .",
    "again , the viewpoint is _ not _ that the polymer representation provides a better physical description of photons in minkowski space .",
    "rather , the primary goal is to develop mathematical and conceptual tools to compare the disparate descriptions , tools which will be finally useful in understanding the relation between quantum field theories on semi - classical quantum geometries representing classical space - times and continuum quantum field theories in these space - times .",

    "for the maxwell theory in minkowski space - time discussed in the section [ s9.1.2 ] , in the polymer picture one can proceed as follows .",
    "first , given a graph @xmath195 , one can set @xmath1132 where @xmath1034 denotes the momentum vector in the cotangent bundle over @xmath992 associated with the @xmath507th edge .",

    "note however that the state is defined simply by analogy with the simpler systems .",

    "however , compelling candidate states are yet to emerge .",
    "finally , the emphasis in this work is on constructing states which are peaked at points on the constraint surface of the classical phase space .",
    "these are kinematical states ; as simple examples show , these states will not solve quantum constraints .",
    "indeed , semi - classical solutions to the quantum constraints would be peaked at points of the reduced phase space , i.e. , roughly , on equivalence classes of 4-metrics where two are equivalent if they are related by a diffeomorphism . to make contact with low energy physics ,",
    "what we need is states peaked at _ individual classical space - times _ , whence it is the kinematical semi - classical states considered here which are more directly relevant .",
    "the relation between the two is being explored systematically .",
    "the overall picture can be summarized as follows : i ) the kinematical states can be regarded as ` gauge fixed versions ' of the semi - classical solutions to constraints ; and , ii ) the expectation values and fluctuations of dirac observables agree in an appropriate sense on the two sets .",
    "spin foams can be thought of as histories traced out by ` time evolution ' of spin networks and provide a path integral approach to quantum dynamics .",
    "since an entire review article devoted to spin foams has appeared recently @xcite , our discussion will be very brief .    in the gravitational context ,",
    "the path integral can play two roles .",
    "first , as in standard quantum field theories , it can be used to compute ` transitions amplitudes ' . however outside , say , perturbation theory about a background space - time , there still remain unresolved conceptual questions about the physical meaning of such amplitudes .",
    "the second role is ` cleaner ' : as in the euclidean approach of hawking and others , it can be considered as a device to extract physical states , i.e. solutions to all the quantum constraint equations . in this role as an _ extractor",
    "_ , it can shed new light on the quantum hamiltonian constraint and on the issue of finding a physical inner product on the space of solutions to all constraints .",
    "the well - defined quantum kinematics of sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] has motivated specific proposals for the definition of path integrals , often called ` state sum models ' .",
    "perhaps the most successful of these is the barrett - crane model and its various modifications . at the classical level",
    ", one regards general relativity as a topological field theory , called the bf theory , _ supplemented with an algebraic constraint_. the bf theory is itself a 4-dimensional generalization of the 3-dimensional chern - simons theory mentioned in section [ s8.2 ] and has been investigated in detail in the mathematical physics literature .",
    "however , the role of the additional constraint is very important .",
    "indeed , bf theory has no local degrees of freedom ; it is the extra constraint that reduces the huge gauge freedom , thereby recovering the local degrees of freedom of general relativity .",
    "the crux of the problem in quantum gravity is the appropriate incorporation of this constraint . at the classical level , ( modulo issues related to degenerate configurations ) the constrained bf theory is equivalent to general relativity . to obtain euclidean general relativity",
    ", one has to start with the bf theory associated with @xmath1147 while the lorentzian theory results if one uses @xmath1148 instead . the barrett - crane model and its extensions are specific proposals to define quantum geometry based path integrals for the constrained bf theory in either case .",
    "fix a 4-manifold @xmath11 bounded by two 3-manifolds @xmath1149 and @xmath1150 .",
    "spin - network states on the two boundaries can be regarded as ` initial ' and ` final ' quantum geometries .",
    "one can then consider histories , i.e. , quantum 4-geometries , joining them .",
    "each history is a spin - foam .",
    "each vertex of the initial spin - network on @xmath1149 ` evolves ' to give a 1-dimensional edge in the spin - foam and each edge , to give a 2-dimensional face .",
    "consequently , each face carries a spin label @xmath266 .",
    "however , in the course of ` evolution ' _ new vertices _ can appear , making the dynamics non - trivial and yielding a non - trivial amplitude for an ` initial ' spin - network with @xmath299 vertices to evolve into a ` final ' spin - network with @xmath1151 vertices .",
    "for mathematical clarity as well as physical intuition , it is convenient to group spin - foams associated with the same 4-dimensional graph but differing from one another in the labels , such as the spins @xmath266 carried by faces .",
    "each group is said to provide a _ discretization _ of the 4-manifold @xmath11 .",
    "physically , a discretization has essentially just the topological information . the geometrical information such as the area associated with each face resides in the labels .",
    "this is an important difference from lattice gauge theories with a background metric , where a discretization itself determines , e.g. , the edge lengths and hence how refined the lattice is .",
    "a notable development is the discovery that the non - perturbative path integral , defined by a certain modification of the barrett - crane model , is equivalent to a manageable _ group field theory _",
    "( gft ) in the sense specified below @xcite .",
    "the gft is a rather simple quantum field theory , defined on four copies of the underlying group @xmath1152 in the case of lorentzian gravity and @xmath1153 in the case of euclidean .",
    "( note that these are just double covers of the lorentz group and the rotation group of euclidean 4-space . )",
    "thus gfts live in high dimensions .",
    "the action has a ` free part ' and an interaction term with a coupling constant @xmath642 .",
    "but the free part is non - standard and does not have the familiar kinetic term , whence the usual non - renormalizability arguments for higher dimensional , interacting theories do not apply .",
    "in fact , the first key recent result is that _ this gft is finite order by order in the feynman perturbation expansion . _",
    "the second key result is @xmath1154 , where @xmath1155 is the modified barret - crane amplitude obtained by summing over all geometries ( i.e. , spin labels @xmath266 ) for a fixed discretization and @xmath1156 is the coefficient of @xmath1157 in the feynman expansion of the gft .",
    "together , the two results imply that , in this approach to quantum gravity , _ sum over geometries for a fixed discrete topology is finite_. this is a highly non - trivial result because , on each face , the sum over @xmath266s ranges from zero to infinity ; there is no cut - off .",
    "however , many open issues remain .",
    "first , in the specific proposal of perez and others , convergence is achieved at a price : the integral is dominated by ` degenerate ' geometries described by by spin foams where all the spins labelling faces are zero except for ` islands ' of higher spin @xcite .",
    "second , in any of the finite models , it is not clear if there is a direct physical interpretation , _ in gravitational terms _ , of the specific amplitudes ( associated with 2-faces and tetrahedra ) that lead to a suppression of divergences .",
    "more importantly , while many of these developments are very interesting from a mathematical physics perspective , their significance to quantum gravity is less clear .",
    "physical issues such as gauge fixing in the path integral are not fully understood in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "( however , recently there has been notable progress in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite . ) finally , the discrete topology is fixed in most of this work and issue of summing over all topologies , or a substitute thereof , remains largely unexplored .",
    "however , this is a very active area of research and the hope is that the current investigations sill soon yield a sufficient intuition and control on mathematical issues to enable one to analyze in detail the deeper , physical problems . in particular",
    ", it is likely that a judicious combination of methods from the canonical treatment of the hamiltonian constraint and spin foam models will lead to significant progress in both areas .",
    "loop quantum gravity is a non - perturbative , background - independent approach to the problem of unification of general relativity and quantum physics . in the last nine sections",
    ", we gave a self - contained account of the core developments in this approach and then summarized the most important physical applications of the framework .",
    "however , due to space limitation we had to leave out several interesting developments , particularly at the forefront of the field . in this section",
    ", we will discuss some of them briefly and outline a few open issues .",
    "_ quantum geometry .",
    "_ as mentioned in section [ s1 ] the necessity of a quantum theory of geometry was strongly motivated by the fact that , in general relativity , gravity is coded in space - time geometry .",
    "however , the quantum geometry framework itself is more general and could be used for background independent quantization of other theories as well .",
    "for example , in two space - time dimensions , yang - mills theory requires only a background volume element , not a metric .",
    "since the classical theory is invariant under all volume preserving diffeomorphisms , it is natural to quantize it in a way that this symmetry is manifest at every step .",
    "quantum geometry techniques have been used to carry out this quantization and this construction has certain advantages over others @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the standard treatments of bosonic string theory , one fixes only a conformal metric on the world - sheet . in 2 dimensions ,",
    "the group of conformal isometries is an infinite dimensional subgroup of the diffeomorphism group and one can again use the standard techniques developed in section [ s4 ] to carry out a quantization in which this symmetry is manifest @xcite .",
    "a recent mathematical development is the natural emergence of quantum groups from quantum geometry considerations @xcite .",
    "suppose for a moment that quantum groups had yet not been invented and one was trying to extend the construction of @xmath203 , introduced in section [ s4 ] , to the most general setting possible , e.g. to obtain mathematically viable generalizations of quantum gauge theories .",
    "then , one would have naturally discovered that @xmath203 can be replaced by a _",
    "non - commutative @xmath490-algebra which has precisely the same structure as a quantum group _ !",
    "this is a fascinating result which brings out the naturalness of constructions underlying quantum geometry .    from conceptual considerations ,",
    "an important issue is the _ physical _ significance of discreteness of eigenvalues of geometric operators ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recall first that in the classical theory differential geometry simply provides us with formulas to compute areas of surfaces and volumes of regions in a riemannian manifold . to turn these quantities in to physical observables of general relativity",
    ", one has to define the surfaces and regions _ operationally _",
    ", e.g. using matter fields .",
    "once this is done , one can simply calculate values of these observables using formulas supplied by differential geometry .",
    "the situation is the same in quantum theory .",
    "for instance , the area of the isolated horizon is a dirac observable in the classical theory and the application of the quantum geometry area formula to _ this _ surface leads to physical results . in 2 + 1 dimensions ,",
    "point particles have recently been incorporated and physical distance between them is again a dirac observable@xcite . when used in this context , the spectrum of the length operator has direct physical meaning . in all these situations ,",
    "the operators and their eigenvalues correspond to the ` proper ' lengths , areas an volumes of physical objects , measured in the rest frames .",
    "finally sometimes questions are raised about compatibility between discreteness of these eigenvalues and lorentz invariance .",
    "there is no tension whatsoever @xcite : it suffices to recall that discreteness of eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator @xmath1158 of non - relativistic quantum mechanics is perfectly compatible with the rotational invariance of that theory .",
    "_ quantum einstein s equations .",
    "_ the challenge of quantum dynamics in the full theory is to find solutions to the quantum constraint equations and endow these physical states with the structure of an appropriate hilbert space .",
    "the general consensus in the loop quantum gravity community is that while the situation is well - understood for gauss and diffeomorphism constraints , it is very far from being definitive for the scalar ( i.e. , the hamiltonian ) constraint .",
    "it _ is _ non - trivial that well - defined candidate operators representing the scalar constraint exist on the space @xmath681 of solutions to the gauss and diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "however as section [ s6.3 ] shows there is a host of ambiguities and none of the candidate operators has been shown to lead to a ` sufficient number of ' semi - classical states in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "a second important open issue is to find restrictions on matter fields and their couplings to gravity for which this non - perturbative quantization can be carried out to a satisfactory conclusion . in the renormalization group approach , for example ,",
    "the situation is as follows .",
    "there is significant evidence for a non - trivial fixed point for pure gravity in 4 dimensions @xcite but when matter sources are included it continues to exist only when the matter content and couplings are suitably restricted",
    ". for scalar fields in particular , percacci and perini @xcite have found that polynomial couplings ( beyond the quadratic term in the action ) are ruled out , an intriguing result that may ` explain ' the triviality of such theories in minkowski space - times .",
    "are there similar constraints coming from loop quantum gravity ?    to address these core issues ,",
    "at least four different approaches are being followed .",
    "the first , and the closest to ideas discussed in section [ s6.3 ] is the ` master constraint program ' recently introduced by thiemann @xcite .",
    "the idea here is to avoid using an infinite number of constraints @xmath1159 , each smeared by a lapse function @xmath100 .",
    "instead , one squares the integrand @xmath1160 itself in an appropriate sense and then integrates it on the 3-manifold @xmath23 .",
    "in simple examples , this procedure leads to physically viable quantum theories @xcite . in the gravitational case , however , the procedure does not seem to remove any of the ambiguities . rather , its principal strength lies in its potential to resolve the difficult issue of finding the physically appropriate scalar product on physical states .",
    "the general philosophy is similar to that advocated by john klauder @xcite over the years in his very interesting approach based on coherent states .",
    "however , there are two key differences",
    ". first , klauder seeks solutions to constraints in the original , kinematical hilbert space rather than in a larger space such as @xmath487 .",
    "consequently , when zero is in the continuous part of the spectrum of constraint operators his physical states are only approximately annihilated by the constraints .",
    "second , in klauder s proposal _ all _ constraints are to be imposed in this manner . in loop quantum gravity",
    ", this does not seem to be feasible for several important technical reasons ; one needs to first solve the gauss and the diffeomorphism constraint and work on the hilbert space @xmath681 .",
    "indeed , to our knowledge , the proposal has not been implemented in sufficient detail to know if the original strategy can be employed to solve the diffeomorphism constraint rigorously , even by itself .",
    "but the program has a key advantage that , since it is based on coherent states , the semi - classical sector can be readily located .",
    "a cross - fertilization of this program and loop quantum gravity is likely to be fruitful in the analysis of low energy physics .",
    "a second approach to quantum scalar constraint is due to gambini , pullin and their collaborators @xcite .",
    "it builds on their earlier extensive work @xcite on the interplay between quantum gravity and knot theory .",
    "the more recent developments use the relatively new invariants of _ intersecting _ knots discovered by vassiliev .",
    "this is a novel approach which furthermore has a potential of enhancing the relation between topological field theories and quantum gravity . as our knowledge of invariants of intersecting knots deepens",
    ", this approach is likely to provide increasingly significant insights . in particular",
    ", it has the potential of leading to a formulation of quantum gravity which does not refer even to a background manifold ( see footnote 5 ) .",
    "the third approach comes from spin - foam models @xcite discussed briefly in section [ s9.2 ] . here",
    ", amplitudes used in the path integrals can be used to restrict the choice of the scalar constraint operator in the canonical theory .",
    "this is a promising direction and the detailed analysis of restrictions is already in progress in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite . in the fourth approach ,",
    "also due to gambini and pullin , one first constructs consistent discrete theories at the classical level and then quantizes them @xcite . in this program",
    ", there are no constraints ; they are solved to find lapse and shift fields .",
    "it has already been applied successfully to gauge theories and certain cosmological models .",
    "an added bonus here is that one can revive a certain proposal made by page and wootters to address the difficult issues of interpretation of quantum mechanics which become especially acute in quantum cosmology , and more generally in the absence of a background physical geometry .",
    "_ applications .",
    "_ as we saw in sections [ s7 ] and [ s8 ] , loop quantum gravity has resolved some of the long - standing physical problems of quantum gravity . as in other approaches to black hole entropy @xcite",
    ", concrete progress could be made because the constructions do not require detailed knowledge of how quantum dynamics is implemented in the _ full _ quantum theory .",
    "recently , the first law of black hole mechanics has been extended to fully dynamical situations @xcite .",
    "its form suggests that the entropy is given by the area of the dynamical horizon .",
    "can the quantum entropy calculation be extended to these non - equilibrium situations ?",
    "this may even provide an input to non - equilibrium statistical mechanics where the notion of entropy is still rather poorly understood .    in quantum cosmology ,",
    "there is ongoing work on obtaining ` effective field equations ' which incorporate quantum corrections @xcite .",
    "quantum geometry effects significantly modify the effective field equations which in turn leads to new physics in the early universe .",
    "in particular , not only is the initial singularity resolved but the ( belinski - khalatnikov - lifschitz type ) chaotic behavior predicted by classical general relativity and supergravity also disappears !",
    "as explained @xcite , this is to be expected on rather general grounds if the underlying geometry exhibits quantum discreteness because even in the classical theory chaos disappears if the theory is truncated at any smallest , non - zero volume",
    ". there are also less drastic but interesting modifications of the inflationary scenario with potentially observable consequences @xcite .",
    "while the technical steps used in these analyses of effective equations are not as clean as those of section [ s7 ] , it is encouraging that loop quantum cosmology is already yielding some phenomenological results .    as explained in section [ s9.1 ] , a frontier area of research is contact with low energy physics . here , a number of fascinating challenges appear to be within reach .",
    "fock states have been isolated in the polymer framework @xcite and elements of quantum field theory on quantum geometry have been introduced @xcite .",
    "these developments lead to concrete questions . for example , in quantum field theory in flat space - times , the hamiltonian and other operators are regularized through normal ordering . for quantum field theory on quantum geometry ,",
    "on the other hand , the hamiltonians are expected to be manifestly finite ( see , e.g. , appendix [ a1 ] ) .",
    "can one then show that , in a suitable approximation , normal ordered operators in the minkowski continuum arise naturally from these finite operators ?",
    "can one ` explain ' why hadamard states of quantum field theory in curved space - times are special ?",
    "these issues also provide valuable hints for construction of viable semi - classical states of quantum geometry .",
    "the final and much more difficult challenge is to ` explain ' why perturbative quantum general relativity fails if the theory exists non - perturbatively . as explained in section [ s1 ] , heuristically the failure can be traced back to the insistence that the continuum space - time geometry is a good approximation even below the planck scale . but a more detailed answer is needed .",
    "is it because , as recent developments in euclidean quantum gravity indicate @xcite , the renormalization group a non - trivial fixed point ?    finally , there is the issue of unification . at a kinematical level",
    ", there is already an unification because the quantum configuration space of general relativity is the same as in gauge theories which govern the strong and electro - weak interactions .",
    "but the non - trivial issue is that of dynamics .",
    "we will conclude with a speculation .",
    "one possibility is to use the ` emergent phenomena ' scenario where new degrees of freedom or particles , which were not in the initial lagrangian , emerge when one considers excitations of a non - trivial vacuum .",
    "for example , one can begin with solids and arrive at phonons ; start with superfluids and find rotons ; consider superconductors and discover cooper pairs . in loop quantum gravity",
    ", the micro - state representing minkowski space - time will have a highly non - trivial planck scale structure .",
    "the basic entities are 1-dimensional and polymer like . even in absence of a detailed theory",
    ", one can tell that the fluctuations of these 1-dimensional entities will correspond not only to gravitons but also to other particles , including a spin-1 particle , a scalar and an anti - symmetric tensor .",
    "these ` emergent states ' are likely to play an important role in minkowskian physics derived from loop quantum gravity .",
    "a detailed study of these excitations may well lead on to interesting dynamics that includes not only gravity but also a select family of non - gravitational fields .",

    "one can easily repeat the procedure used in section [ s2 ] by carrying out a 3 + 1 decomposition also of the maxwell action .",

    "t^i g_i + _ t , where the lapse @xmath100 and shift @xmath115 are the same as in the gravitational sector ( see([h ] ) ) ; @xmath1178 is a freely specifiable function , the lagrange multiplier for the maxwell gauss constraint @xmath1179 ; and @xmath1180 and @xmath1181 , are functionals of @xmath1182 , representing the maxwell energy and momentum density , respectively . specifically , the electromagnetic contribution to the scalar constraint is [ maxham ] ^max ( n )  =  d^3x n(x ) ( ^a(x ) ^b(x ) + ^a(x ) ^b(x ) ) , and ^a  = ^abc(_a_b-_b_a ) is the magnetic vector density . in comparison with the hamiltonian of the maxwell field in minkowski space - time , the presence of the inverse square root of @xmath111 may seem surprising .",
    "note however that the electric and magnetic fields naturally carry density weight one , whence this factor is quite essential . in minkowski space the background metric",
    "is implicitly used to remove the density weight .",
    "one can just use the procedure of section [ s4.3 ] to carry out quantization using @xmath1183 , where @xmath184 refers to geometry and @xmath992 to the maxwell field .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space of the einstein - maxwell theory is given by : _",
    "em  =  _ maxwhere @xmath209 is the hilbert space of states of the quantum geometry of section [ s4.3.2 ] and @xmath1136 is the corresponding hilbert space for the case @xmath1184 .",
    "since we discussed the structure of @xmath209 and of the operators thereon in detail in sections [ s4.3 ] and [ s5 ] , let us focus just on the maxwell sector .",
    "convenient orthonormal basis states @xmath1185 , called _ flux networks _ , in @xmath1186 can be constructed as follows . given a graph @xmath195 , assign an orientation to the edges @xmath1187 , label them by integers @xmath1188 and set f _ , ( )  =  [ ( e_1)]^n_1  [ ( e_n)]^n_n note that if the orientation of an edge @xmath1189 is reversed , the state is unchanged if @xmath1190 is replaced by @xmath1191 .",
    "the poisson bracket relation ( [ maxpb ] ) leads to the definition of the smeared electric operator @xmath1192 : ( g )  =  i \\{(g),}capturing the expectation that @xmath1193 should be represented by @xmath1194 . on the flux network states",
    ", the action reduces to : [ elec ] ( g ) f _ ,  = -(_in_i_e_ig ) f_,.if the support of @xmath367 has non - trivial intersection just with a single edge @xmath1189 of @xmath195 , then the flux network @xmath1185 is an eigenstate of @xmath1195 and the eigenvalue just measures @xmath1190 , the ` electric flux carried by the oriented edge @xmath1189 ' .",
    "thus the electric flux is quantized and the each edge of the flux network @xmath1196 can be thought of as carrying an integral multiple of the fundamental quantum .",
    "as noted in section [ a1.1 ] , the einstein - maxwell theory again has a set of three first class constraints . the action of the gauss constraint for the group @xmath1197 naturally factors on @xmath1198 : @xmath1199 , where @xmath1200 is the gauss constraint operator on the quantum geometry hilbert space @xmath209 and @xmath1201 that on the maxwell hilbert space .",
    "imposition of this constraint selects the _ gauge invariant sub - space _ of @xmath1202 .",
    "the gauge invariant subspace of @xmath209 was obtained in section [ s6.1 ] . on the maxwell hilbert space @xmath1136",
    ", the constraint simply restricts the flux network states as follows : at each vertex the sum of the labels @xmath1190 assigned to the incoming edges is equal to the sum of the labels assigned to the outgoing edges .",
    "note that the solution space is a _ sub - space _ on @xmath1202 .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint @xmath1203 is also straightforward to impose in the exponentiated version .",
    "the general procedure is the same as that of section [ s6.2 ] .",
    "again , the solutions lie in the dual @xmath1204 of @xmath1205 $ ] where @xmath1206 is the space of the cylindrical functions of @xmath992 connections",
    ".    finally , we have to impose the scalar constraint .",
    "regularization of the einstein part @xmath1207 of the constraint was discussed in detail in section [ s6.3 ] . here",
    "we will focus just on the maxwell part @xmath1208 .",
    "we have organized the discussion so that it will serve a dual purpose . on the one hand",
    ", it will provide us the maxwell part of the total hamiltonian constraint that must be imposed to select the physical states of the einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "for this purpose , we will construct an operator which is well - defined on the ( gauge and ) diffeomorphism invariant sector @xmath1209 of @xmath1210 .",
    "on the other hand , in the framework of field theory in a given classical space - time , @xmath1211 can also be regarded as the _ physical hamiltonian _ of the maxwell field .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask if one can construct from @xmath1211 a well - defined operator which will act on @xmath1212 , where @xmath1213 is a given semi - classical state of quantum geometry and @xmath1214 the fock - space of photons on this geometry .",
    "we will show that this is also possible .",
    "the result will be a hamiltonian governing the dynamics of a test quantum maxwell field on a fixed , semi - classical quantum geometry .",
    "in contrast to the maxwell parts @xmath1215 and @xmath1216 of the gauss and the vector constraints , the maxwell part @xmath1217 of the scalar constraint contains a coefficient @xmath1218 that explicitly depends on geometry .",
    "we will first ` regularize ' this term , i.e. express it using variables which have direct operator analogs on the quantum geometry hilbert space .",
    "this discussion will bring out the role played by quantum geometry in regulating the quantum matter hamiltonians . for simplicity",
    ", we will work with just the electric term ; by inspection all equations of this sub - section continue to hold if the electric fields are replaced by magnetic .",
    "consider then the term [ e2 ] _",
    "n(x ) ^a(x)^b(x ) .",
    "we can express the metric @xmath24 using ( a slight generalization of ) the expression ( [ e ] ) for the orthonormal co - frame @xmath707 , e^i_a(x )  =  \\{a^i_a(x ) , v_r } where @xmath1219 is an arbitrary open neighborhood of @xmath484 , and @xmath1220 is its volume with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "the poisson bracket is independent of @xmath1219 and for our regularization purposes , it is convenient to choose it to be the ball @xmath1221 of coordinate volume @xmath1222 , centered at @xmath484 .",
    "denote the geometric volume of this ball ( with respect to @xmath24 ) by @xmath1223 .",
    "approximating @xmath1224 by @xmath1225 it is easy to verify : [ geom ]  = _ 0 ^ 3 \\{a^i_a(x ) , } \\{a^i_b(x ) , } now , in the quantum maxwell theory in minkowski space - time , the electric field becomes an operator valued distribution whence the product of electric fields at the same point , such as the one in ( [ e2 ] ) , is ill - defined .",
    "therefore , with an eye towards quantization , let us point - split the product by introducing a two - point smearing function @xmath1226 : _ ( x , y )  =  .then , we obtain : [ heps ] d^3x n(x ) ^a(x ) ^b(x ) = & & _ 0 _ m d^3x n(x ) _ m d^3y ^a(x)^b(y ) + & & _ ( x , y ) \\{a^i_a(x ) , } \\{a^i_a(y ) , } : = _ 0 ^_elec note that the point splitting procedure requires us to set @xmath1227 but the factor @xmath1228 in the denominator is cancelled by the factor @xmath1222 in the geometric term ( [ geom ] ) .",
    "we will see that , thanks to point splitting , this regulated classical version has a well - defined operator analog in the quantum theory .",
    "had we worked in minkowski space - time , the geometric term @xmath1218 would simply be a smooth field on @xmath23 .",
    "then , the @xmath1228 factor required in the point - splitting procedure would have remained and led to a divergence in the limit as @xmath1229 , i.e. , when the regulator is removed .",
    "this divergence is now avoided because the quantum geometry operator corresponding to @xmath1230 has a well - defined limit as @xmath564 tends to infinity .",
    "_ in this precise sense , the quantum nature of geometry provides a natural regulator for matter hamiltonians _ @xcite .",
    "we now wish to find the quantum analog of the expression on the right side of ( [ heps ] ) . following a strategy introduced by thiemann @xcite",
    ", we will proceed in two steps . in the first , we replace the classical electric field by the corresponding operators and in the second we do the same for geometric fields .",
    "connection @xmath124 . ]",
    "consider a flux network state @xmath1231 in the maxwell hilbert space .",
    "then , using the action ( [ elec ] ) of smeared electric field operators , we immediately obtain the action of the regulated operator @xmath1232 ( see eq .",

    "the second step is now facilitated because the gravitational connection @xmath124 appears only through its along edges of the graph . by dividing the edges into segments of",
    "coordinate length @xmath1234 , replacing the integrals by sums of holonomies and taking the limit @xmath1235 first , followed by the limit @xmath1229 , one obtains the action of the electric part of @xmath1211 on a state @xmath1236 in the full hilbert space @xmath1202 : _",
    "elec(n ) [ _ f _ , ]  = & & _ v n(v ) _",
    "i , jn_in_j + & & ( ( e^-1_i)[(e_i ) , ] ( e_j^-1)[(e_j ) , ] ) [ _ f _ , ] [ elecop]where @xmath323 ranges over the vertices of the graph @xmath180 and , given @xmath323 , @xmath1237 run over the labels of the edges intersecting @xmath323 .",
    "note that this action preserves each sub - space @xmath1238 of @xmath1202 ; it does _ not _ require us to extend the graph @xmath180 . finally , it is straightforward to check that @xmath1239 admits a self - adjoint extension to @xmath1202 .",
    "the starting point is again the expression ( [ heps ] ) , but with @xmath1165 replacing @xmath1240 .",
    "we need to define operator analogs of the magnetic field .",
    "the strategy is the same as that used in section [ s6.3 ] for curvature @xmath899 of the @xmath184 connection of quantum geometry : approximate the dual @xmath1241 of the magnetic field @xmath1240 by holonomies around small closed loops . for this purpose , as in section [ s6.3.1 ] , we again cover @xmath23 with cells @xmath715 ( possibly with arbitrary shape ) and , in every cell , introduce edges @xmath1242 and loops @xmath1243 .",
    "let us label this structure by @xmath1244 .",
    "the idea now is to replace the double integral in the left hand side of ( [ heps ] ) by a generalized riemann sum in which the gravitational connection @xmath1245 are approximated by holonomies along the edges @xmath1242 and the magnetic field is approximated by the holonomies along @xmath1243 .",

( here @xmath1247 are constants determined by the geometry of @xmath1244 . )",
    "it is now straightforward to pass to the regulated operator @xmath1248 . while this operator is well defined in @xmath1249 , as in the gravitational case , its limit as @xmath1229 fails to be well - defined on @xmath1202 .",
    "therefore , to define the constraint operator , as in section [ s6.3.2 ] , we pass to @xmath1209 . given @xmath1250 , the procedure used in section [ s6.3.2 ] leads to the following well - defined action : & &    & & ( ( _ v^i ) ( ( s_v^j)^-1 ) [ ( s_v^j ) , ] ( _ v^i)((s_v^j)^-1 ) [ ( s_v^j ) , ] )    @xmath180 , @xmath1251 and @xmath1252 are the edges and loops of @xmath1244 originating at @xmath323 .",

    "but the geometric operators that appear on the right hand side do not refer to the loops @xmath1252 .",
    "therefore , while the action of @xmath1253 does add new edges to the graph , the spin labels of these edges vanish ; only the maxwell flux quantum numbers @xmath1254 are non - trivial on these edges .      collecting the results of the last two sections , solutions to the quantum scalar constraint",

    "can we use this operator to ` derive ' , _ in a suitable approximation _ , the quantum theory of maxwell fields on static space - times ?",

    "note that these states are _ not _ diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "however , we can exploit the availability of a background metric and use in place of @xmath1253 the regulated operator @xmath1259 , where the area of the loops @xmath1260 is given by the minimum non - zero eigenvalue of the area operator .",
    "the resulting maxwell hamiltonian @xmath1261 has a well - defined action on @xmath1262 .",
    "therefore , we can analyze the evolution of the resulting state and compare it with the standard evolution in the fock space . an important viability criterion for this strategy to work",
    "is that the geometry part of the state does not change appreciably under the action of @xmath1217 . to analyze whether this condition is met",

    "therefore , it is plausible that @xmath1213 does not change appreciably .",
    "however , so far it is not obvious that any of the candidate semi - classical states proposed to date satisfy this condition ; this issue is being investigated .",
