    "new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been intensively studied over the past years@xcite .",
    "most extensions of the sm require an electroweak symmetry breaking sector , which is composed of two scalar isospin - doublets , and the charged higgs bosons are part of its physical spectrum at the weak scale . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "is one of the typical example . from the phenomenological point of view , if a light neutral higgs boson was found , it is still very hard to tell which model it belongs to , since the fundamental properties of such a particle ( quantum number , couplings , branching ratios , etc . ) are almost the same in some models , e.g. in the sm and in the decoupling regime of the mssm ( i.e. , when @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) . while the discovery of the charged higgs boson is an unambiguous signature of existing new physics beyond the sm .",
    "historically , a lot of effort has been invested in the charged higgs boson pair production at the future colliders , such as the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , tevatron , and the proposed linear colliders ( lc ) : nlc@xcite , jlc@xcite , tesla@xcite and clic@xcite .",
    "refs.@xcite@xcite presented the calculations of the charged higgs boson pair productions at hadron colliders in different important production channels .",
    "it shows that the production cross section can reach few femto - bar .",
    "linear colliders can also produce the charged higgs pair with larger production rate , because the process can occur at the tree level and is not suppressed by the light yukawa couplings .",
    "furthermore , the signature of event at lc is much cleaner than that produced at hadron colliders . with the help of high integrated luminosity , the precise measurement at lc for probing the new physics is possible .",
    "therefore , the theoretical calculations beyond the tree - level are necessary in studying the charged higgs boson productions . in ref.@xcite , the process @xmath12 involving one - loop fermion and sfermion corrections has been studied , it points out that the corrections are about @xmath6 in a wide range of parameter space of the mssm .",
    "ref.@xcite gives the complete one - loop electroweak corrections to the cross section of the process @xmath12 in the thdm as well as the mssm .",
    "it shows that the corrections vary in the range between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the o(@xmath15 ) yukawa corrections to the process @xmath16 in the thdm were studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite presents the squarks one - loop corrections to the process @xmath17 in the mssm .",
    "it says that the relative corrections are from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . from the previous works which deal with the complete one - loop corrections to the new particle production processes ,",
    "we know that the detailed study of the one - loop electroweak corrections for those processes at a very high colliding energy is necessary .",
    "an electron - positron lc can be designed to operate in either @xmath20 or @xmath0 collision mode .",
    "@xmath0 collision is achieved by using compton backscattered photons in the scattering of intense laser photons on the initial polarized @xmath20 beams@xcite .",
    "normally , the cross section for @xmath21 is larger than that of @xmath22 due to the fact that the production rate in @xmath20 collision mode is s - channel suppressed . in this paper",
    ", we present the calculations of the full one - loop radiative corrections to the process @xmath16 in the mssm .",

    "finally , we give a short summary .",
    "we denote the subprocess @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the four - momenta of the incoming partons and the outgoing particles , respectively .     subprocess . ]    the feynman diagrams for the subprocess @xmath23 at the leading order(lo ) are shown in fig.1 .",
    "there are three feynman diagrams for this subprocess at the tree - level .",
    "the corresponding tree - level amplitude of the subprocess @xmath27 can be represented as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the amplitudes arising from the t - channel , u - channel and quartic coupling diagrams , respectively .",

    "then the lo cross section for the subprocess @xmath38 is obtained by using the following formula : @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "the summation is taken over the spins of initial and final states , and the bar over the summation denotes averaging over the spins of initial partons .",
    "in our calculations we use the thooft - feynman gauge . in the calculation of one - loop diagrams",
    "we adopt the definitions of one - loop integral functions in ref.@xcite . in order to control the ultraviolet(uv ) divergences , we take the dimensional reduction ( @xmath41 ) regularization scheme , which is commonly used in the calculation of the electroweak correction in the framework of the mssm as it preserves supersymmetry at least at one - loop order@xcite . in doing renormalization",
    "we use on - mass - shell(oms ) scheme@xcite .",
    "the feynman diagrams and their amplitudes are automatically generated by using @xmath42 package@xcite .",
    "there are total 570 one - loop feynman diagrams for the subprocess @xmath43 in the mssm , and we can classify them into four groups : self - energy , vertex , box diagrams and counter - term diagrams .",

    "nevertheless , it still contains the soft ir singularities .",
    "the ir singularity in the @xmath69 is originated from the virtual photonic loop correction , it can be cancelled by the contribution of the real photon emission corrections .",
    "we shall discuss that in the following subsection .",
    "we denote the real photon emission process as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the four - momentum of the radiated photon , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the four - momenta of two initial photons and final charged higgs pair @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the real photon emission feynman diagrams for the process @xmath77 are displayed in fig.[fig : feyn_realphoton ] .    .",
    "]    in our paper , we adopt the general phase - space - slicing method@xcite to separate the soft photon emission singularity from the real photon emission process . by using this method ,",
    "the bremsstrahlung phase space is divided into singular and non - singular regions .",
    "then the correction of the real photon emission is broken down into corresponding soft and hard terms @xmath78 in the c.m.s .",
    "frame , the radiated photon energy @xmath79 is called ` soft ' if @xmath80 or ` hard ' if @xmath81 . here , @xmath82 is a small photon mass , which is used to regulate the infrared divergences existing in the soft term .",
    "although both @xmath83 and @xmath84 depend on the soft photon cutoff @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the electron beam energy in the c.m.s .",
    "frame , the real correction @xmath87 is cutoff independent . in the calculation of soft term",
    ", we use the soft photon approximation .",
    "since the diagrams in fig.[fig : feyn_realphoton ] with real photon radiation from the internal charge higgs line or photon - charge higgs vertex do not lead to ir - singularity , we can neglect them in the calculation of soft photon emission subprocesses ( [ process2 ] ) by using the soft photon approximation method .",
    "in this approach the contribution of the soft photon emission subprocess is expressed as@xcite @xmath88 ^ 2\\ ] ] where the soft photon cutoff @xmath89 satisfies @xmath90 .",
    "the integral over the soft photon phase space has been implemented in ref.@xcite , then one can obtain the analytical result of the soft real photon emission correction to @xmath43 .",
    "as mentioned above , the ir divergence of the virtual photonic corrections can be exactly cancelled by that of soft real correction .",
    "therefore , @xmath91 , the sum of the virtual and soft contributions , is independent of the ir regulator @xmath82 . in the following numerical calculations ,",
    "we have checked the cancellation of ir divergencies and verified that the total contributions of soft photon emission and the virtual corrections are numerically independent of @xmath82 .",
    "in addition , we present the numerical verification of that the total one - loop level ew correction to the cross section of @xmath66 , defined as @xmath92 , is independent of the cutoff @xmath93 .    finally , we get an uv and ir finite correction @xmath94 : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the one - loop relative correction .      the total cross section of the parent process @xmath98 can be written as @xmath99 with @xmath100 , and @xmath101(@xmath102 ) being the @xmath103(@xmath0 ) center - of - mass energy .",
