    "the observation of neutrinos coming from the next galactic supernova ( sn ) driven by gravitational core collapse ( hereafter , sn implies the one caused by the gravitational collapse ) is expected to provide very interesting information on the dynamics of the process , namely , how these stars explode and form black holes , see for instance ref .",
    "moreover , it may also shed light on some unknown neutrino properties such as the neutrino mass ordering , see for e.g.  @xcite . since neutrinos can break free from the dense region of the star from which photons can not escape",
    ", they will be the first messengers from the sky to inform us the occurrence of the gravitational collapse .",
    "indeed , it might be possible that the next galactic sn can not be located by optical observations due to obscuration .",

    "most of the authors considered neutrino electron elastic scattering events in a water cherenkov detector in order to determine the sn direction  @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , for a sn at 10 kpc , the pointing accuracy is @xmath3 at 95% c.l . if the super - kamiokande detector is considered .",
    "this can be further improved to @xmath4 if gadolinium is added to water  @xcite , allowing to tag neutrinos from the inverse beta decay background . a megaton size water cherenkov detector using this technique may be able to increase the pointing precision to @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the method of the arrival - time triangulation , previously discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , was readily dismissed due to the low precision on the arrival time of sn neutrinos expected mainly because the available detectors at that time were too small to register enough statistics for such a purpose .",
    "we are now , however , entering a new era of large - scale detectors with icecube currently working in the south pole  @xcite , the proposals of hyper - kamiokande in japan  @xcite and of the european detectors which will be built in the pyhsalmi mine in finland  @xcite . in view of this new trend ,",
    "it is timely to revisit the usefulness of neutrino triangulation using big detectors in different continents , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    according to  @xcite , the icecube detector can determine the arrival time of sn neutrinos with an uncertainty of @xmath0 3.5 ms at 95 % c.l .. in the case of a so - called failed sn , where a black hole is formed while the neutrino flux is still measurably high  @xcite , one expects the neutrino signal to terminate abruptly . as this sharp transition",
    "is expected to take place in @xmath6 0.5 ms  @xcite the end - point of the neutrino spectrum can also be used for triangulation .    since the observation of the arrival of sn neutrinos by various detectors will be a valuable tool to alert astronomers about the occurrence of the star collapse  @xcite allowing them to observe the light curve as early as possible or the formation of a black hole ( in the case of a failed sn )",
    ", it is important to explore different approaches to reconstruct the location of the sn as well as the failed sn in the sky .",
    "the distribution of sn in the milky way is expected to be concentrated in the galactic disc . for the sake of discussion ,",
    "let us consider the same sn distribution considered in refs .",

    "this is because four is the minimum number of detector positions needed to uniquely determine the sn location , as we will see below .",
    "if we add more detector sites such as gran sasso and sudbury , the results would be improved .",
    "we note that there is no strong dependence of the results as long as we select four detector locations which are well separated from each other .",

    "it is also possible to see that if we have three different detector sites , we can restrict the possible sn positions to only two locations in the sky .",
    "for example , the curves for the kamioka - south pole and pyhsalmi - south pole combinations intersect in two locations , the true location of the sn as well as a _ fake _ solution .",
    "if we have detectors at four different sites , it is possible to eliminate the fake solutions and single out the true location in the sky , as shown in @xcite . in practice , however , due to the finite resolution of the sn neutrino arrival time measurement , we can only establish the sn direction with limited precision .",

    "this value is about a factor 6 worse than what we obtained in table i for icecube .",

    "let us make a brief summary of our results on how the pointing accuracy depends on the number of detectors used in the analysis .",

    ". nevertheless , this is better than no information at all and especially useful in the case where the sn can not be located by optical observation , because of dust , or , in the case of a failed sn , because it is accompanied by a bh formation .",
    "the era of high - statistics neutrino detectors has started .",
    "icecube is already operating in the south pole and in a decade or so we expect to also have hyper - kamiokande in japan as well as one very large neutrino detector in the future european underground laboratory in pyhsalmi .",
    "there is also a possibility to construct a new neutrino detector in the southern hemisphere at andes .",
    "this makes the determination of the angular position of a nearby sn by comparing the arrival time of the first sn neutrinos at these different detector locations on the earth an interesting possibility .",
    "the time resolution of the triangulation technique will be dominated by the smallest detector , since the precision of the reconstruction of the neutrino signal onset depends on the number of neutrinos registered by the detector ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : delta - t-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : delta - t-2 ] ) ) . we have demonstrated that , in general , one needs to combine the timing of four different detector locations in order to uniquely localize the sn using this method .    assuming a rather optimistic , but not impossible , uncertainty on the arrival time difference between two detectors to be @xmath90 ( 2 - 4 ) ms , we have estimated the angular resolution of the determination of the location of a sn that could occur in the galactic center given by four detectors located at the south pole ( icecube ) , kamioka ( super - kamiokande or hyper - kamiokande ) , andes and pyhsalmi ( lena , memphys and glacier ) .",
    "we established that in this case the angular position can be known within @xmath1 5 ( 10)@xmath2 in declination and @xmath91 in right ascension for the time resolution of 2 ( 4 ) ms .",

    "also thanks institut de physique thorique of cea - saclay for the hospitality during the time this work was developed and acknowledges partial support from the european union fp7 itn invisibles ( pitn - ga-2011 - 289442 ) .",
    "the sn location can be given in the so - called equatorial coordinate system by two angular coordinates , @xmath9 known as right ascension and @xmath10 known as declination .",
    "right ascension measures the angular distance eastward along the celestial equator from the vernal equinox , its is analogous to terrestrial longitude . usually right ascension is not given in degrees but rather in sidereal hours , minutes and seconds .",
    "the vernal point is defined by where the celestial equator and the ecliptic intersect at 00@xmath9200@xmath9300@xmath94 and longitude 0@xmath2 . by definition",
    "the north celestial pole corresponds to @xmath95 , so it is analogous to the terrestrial latitude .",
    "let us assume that a detector positioned at the @xmath80-th site on the earth is localized , at a certain time @xmath99 , by the following vector @xmath100 with coordinates @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the radius of the earth and @xmath103 is the latitude corresponding to the position of the detector .",
    "the angle @xmath104 depends on time and can be given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the longitude corresponding to the initial position of the detector , @xmath107 is the angular velocity of the daily rotation of the earth and @xmath108 is the angular velocity corresponding to the annual rotation of the earth around the sun .",
    "the time @xmath99 refers to the moment of the day the sn explosion occurred ( @xmath109 h ) , given in terms of the coordinated universal time ( utc ) , whereas @xmath110 , assumed to be common for all detectors , is the time elapsed after the vernal point when the detector received the sn neutrinos .",
    "so , if we have two detectors , say , one at site 1 and the other at site 2 , we can , explicitly , write the observed arrival time difference as @xmath111 , \\label{eq : delta - t2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which constrains the possible values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
