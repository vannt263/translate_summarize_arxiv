    "in a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) a massive ob - type star is in close orbit with a compact x - ray source , a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "the x - ray source is powered by accretion of material originating from the ob star , transported by the ob - star wind or by roche - lobe overflow . the majority ( @xmath0  % ) of the hmxbs",
    "are be / x - ray binaries with relatively wide ( @xmath1 weeks to several years ) and eccentric orbits .",
    "most be / x - ray binaries are transients , the x - ray flux being high when the compact star in its eccentric orbit passes through the dense equatorial disk around the be star ( van den heuvel & rappaport 1987 , negueruela , these proceedings ) .",
    "about a dozen hmxbs host a massive ob - supergiant companion ( about 10 to over 40  m@xmath2 ) , in a relatively tight orbit ( @xmath1 several days ) with an x - ray pulsar or black - hole companion ( e.g. kaper 2001 ) .",
    "some of these x - ray binaries include a dense accretion disk and produce relativistic jets ( e.g. fender 2005 ) .",
    "hmxbs mark an important though short phase ( on the order of 10,000 year ) in the evolution of the most massive binaries .",
    "the compact companion is the remnant of the initially most massive star in the system that exploded as a supernova ( or as a gamma - ray burst ) . due to a phase of mass transfer ,",
    "the secondary became the most massive star in the system before the primary supernova , so that the system remained bound ( van den heuvel & heise 1972 ) .",
    "a consequence , however , is that hmxbs are runaways due to the kick velocity exerted by the supernova ( blaauw 1961 , kaper et al .",
    "1997 , van den heuvel et al .",
    "2000 ) . when the secondary starts to become a supergiant , a second phase of mass transfer is initiated , first through an enhanced stellar wind , later by roche - lobe overflow , which results in the production of x - rays by the compact companion . with increasing mass transfer rate",
    ", the system will enter a phase of common - envelope evolution causing the compact object to spiral into the ob companion . in the relatively wide",
    "be / x - ray binaries the spiral - in likely results in the removal of the envelope of the be companion , and after the supernova a bound ( or disrupted ) double neutron star remains , like the hulse - taylor binary pulsar psr  1913 + 16 ( or a neutron star  white dwarf system , if the mass of the be companion is less than @xmath3  m@xmath2 ) .",
    "in close hmxbs ( orbital period less than about a year ) the compact object will enter the core of the ob companion which will become a so - called thorne - zytkow object ( thorne & zytkow 1977 ) , a red supergiant with a high mass - loss rate .",
    "these objects have been predicted on evolutionary grounds , but have so far not been recognized as such ( for an extensive review on binary evolution , see van den heuvel 1994 ) .    in case",
    "the system hosts an x - ray pulsar , its orbit can be very accurately determined through pulse - timing analysis .",
    "when also the radial - velocity curve of the ob supergiant is obtained , the mass of the neutron star and that of the massive star can be derived with precision , given an estimate of the system inclination ( cf .",
    "rappaport & joss 1983 ) .",
    "the neutron star mass carries information on the formation mechanism ( i.e. the supernova ) , as well as on the equation of state ( eos ) of matter at supra - nuclear density .",
    "evolutionary calculations by timmes et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that in single hydrogen - rich stars with a mass less than 19  m@xmath2 the collapsing fe core has a mass of about 1.3  m@xmath2 , while stars with a higher initial mass produce an fe core of about 1.7  m@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , one would predict a bimodal mass distribution of the neutron stars in these systems .",
    "the eos , i.e. the relation between pressure and density in the neutron - star interior , can so far only be studied on the basis of theoretical models .",
    "it is not yet possible to produce the required extremely high density ( about an order of magnitude higher than an atomic nucleus ) in accelerator experiments .",
    "theoretical predictions of the eos come in two flavors : the so - called `` soft '' and `` hard '' equations of state .",
    "the hardness of the eos depends on the fraction of bosons formed in the neutron - star interior , which unlike the fermions ( neutrons ) do not contribute to the fermi pressure that helps to sustain gravity .",
    "the harder the eos , the higher the mass a neutron star can have . if a neutron star has a mass higher than the maximum mass allowed by a given eos , this eos is ruled out as only one eos can be the right one . obviously , this relatively simple measurement has major implications for our understanding of the properties of matter at supra - nuclear density .",
    "the properties of the ob star in a hmxb give insight into the evolutionary history of the binary system : its current mass provides a constraint on the initial mass of the primary , its surface may show evidence of nuclearly processed material coming from the primary , and its rotation rate has been altered by the angular momentum content of the gained mass . also , the space velocity of the system carries information on the amount of mass lost during the supernova explosion ( nelemans et al .",
    "1999 , ankay et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "contrary to the be / x - ray binaries , a few ob - supergiant systems host a black - hole companion ( e.g. cyg  x-1 , gies & bolton 1982 ) , which suggests that black holes are formed by the most massive stars only .",
    "the majority of the about twenty known black - hole candidates have a low - mass companion ( soft x - ray transient or x - ray nova , e.g. mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) , but only the three black - hole candidates known in hmxbs are persistent x - ray sources .",
    "some of the black holes in x - ray novae appear to be linked to hypernovae believed to power gamma - ray bursts , based on the detection of r - processed elements at the surface of the low - mass companions ( e.g. israelian et al .",
    "table  1 lists the basic properties of the hmxbs with ob supergiant companions in the milky way and the magellanic clouds .",
    "most sources contain an x - ray pulsar : the pulse period is short and the x - ray luminosity high ( near the eddington limit @xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 ) in systems undergoing roche - lobe overflow due to the higher accretion rate .",
    "the latter systems also have circular orbits , while the wind - fed systems have eccentricities up to @xmath6 ( gx301 - 2 ) and an x - ray luminosity @xmath7  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "the x - ray source drastically increases the degree of ionization of the surrounding stellar wind .",
    "hatchett & mccray ( 1977 ) predicted that the ionizing power of the x - ray source would cause the orbital modulation of ultraviolet resonance lines formed in the stellar wind .",
    "the hatchett - mccray effect has been detected in several systems ( e.g. van loon et al .",
    "2001 ) , and recently in the wind - fed system 4u1700 - 37 for which the original prediction was made ( see iping et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "van der meer et al .",
    "( 2005a ) find evidence for the ionization zone in 4u1700 - 37 through x - ray spectroscopy carried out with xmm-_newton_. a secondary effect of the presence of an x - ray ionization zone is the development of a strong shock ( called a photo - ionization wake ) at its trailing border , where fast wind collides with the stagnant flow inside the ionization zone ( blondin et al .",
    "1990 , kaper et al .",
    "1994 ) . in roche - lobe overflow systems",
    "the high x - ray luminosity makes that only in the x - ray shadow behind the ob supergiant a normal stellar wind can develop , a so - called shadow wind ( e.g. blondin 1994 , kaper et al .",

    "knowledge of the orbital inclination is essential ; in systems showing an x - ray eclipse the inclination must be larger than @xmath16 . for roche - lobe overflow systems",
    "a valid assumption is that the ob supergiant is in corotation with the orbit , which provides a strong constraint on the inclination . in eclipsing systems the radius of the ob supergiant",
    "can be derived from the duration of the x - ray eclipse .",
    "the mass ratio sets the size of the roche lobe ( e.g.eggleton 1983 ) ; it turns out that the measured radii of the ob supergiants are in very good agreement with the estimated size of the roche lobe ( kaper 2001 ) .",
    "earlier studies ( e.g.  conti 1978 , rappaport & joss 1983 ) suggested that the ob supergiants in hmxbs are too luminous for their masses .",
    "e.g.  the o6.5 giant companion of cen  x-3 has a mass of 20  m@xmath2 , while its luminosity corresponds to that of a star of more than 50  m@xmath2 . besides this , the radius corresponding to the luminosity and effective temperature is larger than its measured ( roche - lobe ) radius ( cf .",
    "kaper 2001 ) .",
    "thus , apart from being undermassive , the ob supergiants in hmxbs also seem to be undersized for their luminosity and temperature .",
    "this inconsistency is probably related to the phenomenon of roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the ob star tries to become a supergiant , but at some point it reaches its critical roche lobe and starts to transfer mass to its companion .",
    "while the luminosity of the star is determined by the core ( which does not notice much of what is happening to the outer mantle ) , the star would like to be bigger than allowed by its roche lobe and is peeled off .",
    "in figure  1 the mass distribution is shown of neutron stars and black holes , based on measurements collected from literature ( stairs 2004 , mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) .",
    "the neutron stars occupy a relatively narrow mass range near 1.4  m@xmath2 .",
    "the most accurate neutron - star masses have been derived for the binary radio pulsars , with an average mass of 1.35@xmath170.04  m@xmath2 ( thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) .",
    "the x - ray pulsars show a somewhat larger mass range , extending both below and above 1.35  m@xmath2 .",
    "the neutron star in vela  x-1 is significantly more massive : @xmath18  m@xmath2 ( barziv et al .",
    "2001 , quaintrell et al .",
    "such a high neutron - star mass would rule out the soft equations of state .",
    "also for 4u  1700 - 37 a high neutron - star mass is claimed ( @xmath19  m@xmath2 , clark et al .",
    "2002 ) , although the x - ray source is , contrary to vela  x-1 , not an x - ray pulsar ( and perhaps a low - mass black hole ) .",
    "van der meer et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) are currently analyzing the radial - velocity curves of other ob - supergiant systems with an ( eclipsing ) x - ray pulsar to find out whether vela  x-1 is an exception or that the neutron stars in these systems systematically deviate from the `` canonical '' mass of 1.35  m@xmath2 .",
    "this would provide an important constraint on the neutron - star formation mechanism ( i.e. the supernova ) .",
    "evolutionary calculations by timmes et al .",
    "( 1996 ) predict that massive stars in close binaries which explode as type  ib supernova give rise to initial neutron star masses in a narrow mass range around 1.3  m@xmath2 .",
    "this value does not include subsequent mass accretion from a reverse shock or from a massive component in a binary system , and timmes et al .",
    "expect that the final masses could be somewhat higher .",
    "interestingly , for single stars , which explode as type  ii supernovae , they find a bimodal neutron - star mass distribution , with narrow peaks near 1.27 and 1.76  m@xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned , they did not find a bimodal distribution for stars in close binaries , but at present it is not clear whether this result will hold .",
    "if stars in close binaries turn out to be more similar to single stars after all , one could assign most neutron stars to the first peak , and vela  x-1 ( and 4u1700 - 37 ) to the second .",
    "the estimated masses of black - hole candidates are substantially larger ( @xmath20  m@xmath2 ) than those measured for neutron stars .",
    "this suggests that neutron stars and black holes are formed in different ways .",
    "if , for example , black holes are the result of `` failed '' supernovae in which the stellar mantle is not blown away , but accreting on the compact remnant , one would expect a significant difference in mass between neutron stars and black holes .",
    "however , if the mass of the ( proto ) neutron star is increased by the fall back of material which was located outside the collapsing degenerate fe core , one would predict that neutron stars would occupy a range in mass , up to the maximum neutron star mass allowed by the equation of state . certainly in the binary radio pulsars such a mass distribution is not observed . with the recent evidence that a black hole may be formed during the collapse of a massive star during a gamma - ray burst ( grb980425 , galama et al .",
    "1998 , iwamoto et al . 1998 ) , the hypothesis would be that neutron stars are formed in `` ordinary '' supernovae , while black holes originate from gamma - ray bursts .",
    "some x - ray binaries , most notably those hosting a black hole , produce relativistic jets ( e.g. fender 2005 ) . a famous example is ss433 which shows collimated , precessing jets with velocities of @xmath21 ( margon 1982 ) . in some systems ,",
    "e.g. grs1915 + 105 , superluminal motions have been measured , proving that the material in the jet is moving at relativistic velocities as is observed in quasars . in our sample ( tab .  1 )",
    "three `` microquasars '' are included , i.e. ls5039 , ss433 , and cyg  x-1 .",
    "lmc  x-1 and lmc  x-3 are also candidate members of this group , but for these systems only upper limits are obtained in observations searching for the radio synchrotron emission produced by the jets .",
    "this jet phenomenon is not unique to black - hole systems ; also some x - ray binaries hosting a neutron star are known to produce jets ( e.g. sco  x-1 , cir  x-1 ) . besides the jets",
    ", these systems also include a ( large ) accretion disk . apparently , a relatively large mass and angular momentum accretion rate results in the formation of a dense accretion disk and jets .",
    "cyg  x-1 is one of the most famous stellar - mass black - hole candidates and one of the most intensively studied x - ray sources in the sky , at all wavelengths .",
    "cyg  x-1 probably represents a situation between pure , spherical wind accretion and roche - lobe overflow .",
    "every few years cyg  x-1 makes a transition from a low / hard state to a high / soft state in which the soft x - ray flux increases dramatically and the spectrum softens for a period of weeks to months .",
    "the radio flux also varies during state changes and is associated with jets ( stirling et al .",
    "the precise physical cause for the state transitions remains unclear , but may be triggered by episodes of decreased mass - loss rate in the supergiant donor star ( gies et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "hillwig et al .",
    "( 2004 ) present spectroscopy of ss433 obtained near primary eclipse and disk precessional phase @xmath22 , when the accretion disk is expected to be most `` face - on '' .",
    "these conditions are the most favourable to have a change to detect the mass donor .",
    "the spectra show clear evidence of absorption features consistent with a classification of an a3-a7 supergiant .",
    "the observed radial velocity variations are in antiphase to the disk spectrum ; the latter includes strong emission lines similar to those observed in wolf - rayet stars ( see also fuchs et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "hillwig et al .",
    "derive masses of @xmath23  m@xmath2 and @xmath24  m@xmath2 for the mass donor and compact object plus disk , respectively .",
    "ls5039 is an o6.5  v((f ) ) star ( clark et al .",
    "2001 ) with a compact companion , most likely a neutron star .",
    "it has radio - emitting relativistic jets and is probably a high - energy gamma - ray source as well ( paredes et al .",
    "it is a 4.4-day binary with a high eccentricity ( @xmath25 ) , which probably results from the huge mass loss that occured with the supernova producing the compact star .",

    "( 2004 ) present new optical and ultraviolet spectra of the o star and find evidence for nitrogen enhancement and carbon depletion in its atmosphere , indicative of the accretion of nuclearly processed material originating from the compact star s massive progenitor . the observed eccentricity and runaway velocity can be reconciled only if the neutron star received a modest kick velocity due to a slight asymmetry in the supernova explosion ( during which more than 5  m@xmath2 was ejected ) .",
