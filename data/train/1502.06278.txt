    "+ a natural extension of marchal s theorem is to search solutions defined on an infinite interval @xmath17 , starting from a given configuration at @xmath18 and having a given asymptotic behaviour for @xmath19 .",
    "the classification of all possible asymptotic behaviour of solutions in the n - body problem has been investigated since the beginning of the last century .",
    "the main results in this direction are due to j. chazy . in [ cha1 ]",
    "it is shown that there are only seven possible final evolutions in the three - body problem . among these seven possibilities",
