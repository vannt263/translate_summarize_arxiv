    "the so - called _ adiabatic piston _ is a long known problem in classical thermodynamics , which can be stated as follows  @xcite .",
    "an isolated cylinder of length @xmath0 , containing a gas , is divided by an adiabatic wall ( no internal degrees of freedom ) , _ the piston _ , into two compartments ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the initial condition is prepared in the following way : the piston is kept fixed by a clamp at a given position @xmath1 ; the gases in the left ( @xmath2 ) and right ( @xmath3 ) compartments are in equilibrium defined by their pressure , temperature and volume : @xmath4 . by assuming that the two gases are perfect and composed by @xmath5 molecules with equal masses @xmath6 , the gas state equation @xmath7 holds in both chambers ( where the boltzmann constant is set to unity by rescaling the temperatures ) . being the piston adiabatic , the two subsystems are in equilibrium even if @xmath8 . at @xmath9",
    "the clamp is removed and the piston is free to move without friction with the cylinder .",
    "the nontrivial question is to predict the system evolution and the final position of the piston and of the thermodynamic quantities .     and",
    "@xmath3 indicate the left and right compartments , respectively . ]    at the beginning of last century , the above setup was used as experimental device for measuring the ratio @xmath10 of the specific heat of gases @xcite , that is linked to the period of the piston oscillations . renewed interest on the problem has lead to recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , several attempts were made to predict the final equilibrium state by using the laws of thermodynamics only , ending in controversial answers .",
    "a naive application of the first two laws of thermodynamics lead to the ( wrong ) conclusion that the equilibrium conditions is @xmath11 .",
    "a more careful treatment  @xcite shows that the correct answer is @xmath12 .",
    "however , such a condition says nothing about the final position of the piston and gas temperatures , which remain undetermined .",
    "therefore , equilibrium thermodynamics can not predict the final state . to shed light on the problem one has to cope with the non - equilibrium process that occurs after the clamp removal .    from a microscopic point of view",
    "the adiabatic piston problem for ideal gases ( non - interacting particles ) can be described in terms of a one dimensional model , where the piston is a heavy particle of mass @xmath13 much larger that the mass @xmath6 of the gas molecules , which collide elastically with the piston .",
    "as argued by feynman , the system first converges toward a state of mechanical equilibrium with @xmath14 , consistently with the thermodynamic prediction .",
    "then , the pressure fluctuations , which are asymmetric because @xmath15 , very slowly drive the system toward thermal equilibrium @xmath16 @xcite . in this way",
    "the final position of the piston and the thermodynamic quantities are determined .",
    "more recently , the problem was the subject of renewed attention , mainly stimulated by the talk of lieb at the statistical physics conference in 1998 @xcite , and by the connection of this problem with the physics of mesoscopic systems @xcite and brownian motors @xcite .    among the first attempts to understand quantitatively the time evolution of the adiabatic piston we mention crosignani et al .",
    "@xcite who introduced a set of ordinary differential equations for the macroscopic observables .",
    "however , this model was only able to account for the position of the piston in the state of mechanical equilibrium and not for the final thermodynamic one .    remaining in the framework of ideal gases , a systematic investigation in statistical mechanics terms , together with numerical simulations , has been carried on in the last decade by gruber and coworkers  @xcite . in these works",
    "the problem has been examined in several limits ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "in particular , in the thermodynamic limit taken by letting the system size @xmath0 and the piston mass @xmath13 to go to infinity by holding fixed the ratios @xmath17 and @xmath18 , it has been shown that the system evolution can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations for the macroscopic observables ( i.e. the gas left / right temperatures , and the moments of the piston velocity ) .",
    "these equations were obtained by using the liouville and boltzmann equations .",
    "within such an approach it is possible to control the deviations from maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the gas velocities , observed in the simulations , and a whole hierarchy of equations can be written for all moments of the piston velocity .",
    "remarkably , these equations describe not only the reaching of mechanical equilibrium , which comes from the treatment at zero order in @xmath19 @xcite , but also the final equilibrium state , which comes from the first order terms in @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "these analytical results have been shown by the same authors to be in agreement with numerical simulations of the ideal gas piston problem . though it remains open the problem of a detailed description of the early stage of the dynamics in which the presence of shock waves has an important impact on the dynamics .",
    "some recent attempts in this direction can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the initial pressures are different , the system phenomenology can be described as follows  @xcite . in a first stage , the piston oscillates driven by the pressure difference .",
    "these oscillations are then damped till the `` mechanical equilibrium '' state , @xmath20 but @xmath21 , is reached .",
    "then , as argued by feynman , it follows a regime controlled by the asymmetry in the fluctuations felt by the left / right walls .",
    "this phase is characterized by a very slow approach to the thermodynamic equilibrium , @xmath20 and @xmath22 , with the piston position fluctuating around the middle of the cylinder . in the oscillatory phase , both experiments @xcite ,",
    "numerical computations and analytical arguments  @xcite have shown the existence of two different regimes : _ weak and strong damping _ , the relevant parameter being @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 the adiabatic oscillations of the piston are weakly damped , while for @xmath25 they are over - damped , @xmath26 being @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "still in the context of ideal gases , it is worth mentioning some recent approaches based on dynamical systems theory that have been developed by chernov , lebowitz and sinai  @xcite . in this context , also the case of gases starting from non - equilibrium conditions has been considered  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the ultimate goal would be to quantitatively understand the behavior of the system for an interacting gas , but this seems to be still too ambitious .",
    "indeed only very few studies analyzed the case of gas composed by interacting particles  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a limiting case which has the advantage of being more tractable while displaying most of the non - trivial features of the problem .",
    "the basic idea of our approach is to assume that the gases in the two compartments are composed of interacting molecules and thus characterized by a relaxation time toward the equilibrium state .",
    "our main hypothesis is that this time is very short compared with all the other characteristic times of the system . in particular , we require that any fluctuation away from equilibrium ( which is characterized by homogeneously distributed gas molecules with a maxwell - boltzmann velocity statistics ) induced by the collision with the piston is re - adsorbed before the new collision with the piston walls . physically speaking , the efficient re - adsorption of the fluctuations means that the ( mechanical ) work done by the piston is immediately converted into heat ; an obvious consequence is that shock waves are ruled out . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the gases follow the perfect gas law .",
    "these hypothesis make the problem tractable while retaining the basic phenomenology of the original problem .",
    "although a microscopic model of a gas able to fulfill the above requirements may sound rather artificial , at a practical level such a `` microscopic model '' can be easily implemented on a computer .",
    "the basic idea is to start with an equilibrium configuration with temperatures @xmath28 for the gases , and then reinitialize the gas molecules as soon as one particle collides with the piston .",
    "the temperatures are recomputed after the collision and used for extracting a new configuration of the gas molecules .",
    "the procedure is then repeated . in the following",
    "we shall call such a model",
    "_ randomized gas_. even though , no actual interaction among the particles is actually considered , one can think that the re - generation of the gas configuration from an equilibrium one ( but with the new temperature ) is the result of such `` unresolved '' interactions .    with the above assumptions for the gas",
    ", we will derive a set of ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of the macroscopic quantities describing the state of the system .",
    "indeed the fact that the gas is always homogeneous and following the maxwell - boltzmann distribution allows us to compute the joint probability density function that , in a given state of the system , the first colliding gas particle hits the piston in a time @xmath29 and with a velocity @xmath30 .",
    "then , by averaging over this joint distribution the energy and momentum exchange due to the collisions with the piston , we derive the evolution of the macroscopic observables .",
    "the minimal set of variables required to have a closed set of equations is made up of the gas temperatures , the mean piston position , the first and second moment of the piston velocity .",
    "the second moment is required for accounting the piston fluctuations which , as argued by feynman , are crucial for recovering the correct thermodynamic equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the equations are derived perturbatively up to the first order in @xmath19 .",
    "as we will see , though with a different approach and assumption , these equations are very similar to those derived by gruber and coworkers  @xcite , in particular at the zeroth order in @xmath19 they are identical .",
    "we compare then the evolution of the system obtained by simulations of the ideal and randomized gas .",
    "in particular , the agreement in the first ( mechanical ) regime is quantitatively perfect in the case of the randomized gas . while in the second regime , which is dominated by the fluctuations , the agreement seems to be only qualitative .",
    "somehow surprisingly , we found that , in this regime , a better quantitative agreement seems to be possible disregarding some @xmath31 terms .",
    "however , with such terms excluded the equipartition of energy at equilibrium is violated by the piston . some hints to explain these findings could come by higher orders terms in the expansion .",
    "unfortunately , the computation of the higher order terms is very cumbersome .",
    "since the newest aspects of our work is in the proposed derivation and in the introduction of the randomized gas model , we present in this paper the all approach up to first order in @xmath19 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec:1 ] we present our approach based on the collision statistics and derive the equations for the macroscopic observables . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we compare the results of the model with those obtained by simulations .",
    "discussions and conclusions can be found in section  [ sec:3 ] . in order to avoid long appendices , the technical material , with the detailed derivation and all the formulas needed to make explicit",
    "the equations , is presented as _ electronic supplementary material _",
    "the underlying idea of our approach is to derive a set of deterministic dynamical equations for the `` macroscopic '' variables describing the evolution of the thermodynamic state of the system under the assumption that , at any time , the gases in both chambers are perfect and at equilibrium . in other words",
    "the gases are able to instantaneously dissipate the fluctuations induced by the collisions with the piston .",
    "thus a maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium state holds always in both compartments but , in general , with different temperatures and volumes .",
    "while the above hypothesis define the macroscopic state of the gas , for the piston the problem is more subtle .",
    "we would like to describe its motion on times longer than the single collisions , that is to average its instantaneous position and velocity @xmath32 over the collisions so to obtain a deterministic ( macroscopic ) trajectory defined by the average position @xmath33 and velocity @xmath34 the symbol @xmath35}$ ] denotes the average over the collisions . as discussed in the introduction , it is crucial to account also for the fluctuations of the piston velocity . for this reason , the second moment of the piston velocity @xmath36",
    "is included in the description .    in the thermodynamic limit we will consider",
    ", one can argue that the fluctuation of the piston position can be safely ignored .",
    "this means that in the following we will consider the piston position as a deterministic quantity and we shall use only the mean piston position @xmath37 .",
    "given the piston position , the gas is characterized by the temperature @xmath28 , and volume @xmath38 , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( we assume a 1d geometry for the sake of simplicity ) .",
    "being perfect gases , the pressures are given by the equation of state @xmath41 .    in the sequel",
    "we show how to derive a set of differential equations for the evolution of @xmath37 , @xmath42 , @xmath36 and @xmath28 . in order to keep the presentation as simple as possible , here we shall sketch how the equations can be derived and the averages performed skipping all the algebra of the computation , which is detailed in @xcite .      for the formal derivation of the deterministic equations , we only need the above discussed assumptions and a microscopic ingredient : the elastic collision rules @xmath43 primes denote postcollisional velocities , and @xmath30 the colliding gas particle velocity .",
    "the quantities we are interested in are the time derivatives of the macroscopic observables @xmath44 where we set the boltzmann constant @xmath45 .",

    "the first observation is that eqs .",
    "( [ eq2:vx]-[eq2:tr ] ) ensure the energy conservation ( [ eq : energy_conservation ] ) both at the zeroth and first order , meaning that the expansion is consistent .",
    "notice also that the relative importance of the various terms is not the same at all times .",
    "as the system evolves , their relative weights change corresponding to the different stages of the evolution , briefly summarized in the introduction and detailed in the following .",
    "for example , consider @xmath58 . at the beginning @xmath73",
    ", then it grows until it reaches its equilibrium value .",
    "consequently , the terms which involve the velocity fluctuations are not important at the beginning .",
    "while they become @xmath31 and play a crucial role in the final stage of the system evolution .",
    "the opposite is true for the terms involving the average drift @xmath42 , which is close to zero in the second ( brownian ) stage of the evolution , and large in the first ( mechanical ) part of the system evolution . among the terms involving the piston velocity fluctuations",
    ", we should mention a special role played by those in which it does not ( explicitly ) appear @xmath58 .",
    "these are the terms of the form @xmath74 and @xmath75 , as we will see they will be both proportional to @xmath58 and , as anticipated , find their origin in the way the fluctuations of @xmath63 affect the collision statistics ( see next subsections and the supplementary material  @xcite ) .",
    "however , a closer inspection shows that @xmath76 is very small at all times . in the first stage",
    "the fluctuations are negligible while in the second stage the average drift is very small . though we retained this term in the equations and in the numerical simulations , one can show that they can be removed without problem .",
    "differently the terms @xmath77 are very important in the final stage of the evolution and , as discussed below , for obtaining the correct equilibrium state .",
    "we are still left with performing the infinite volume limit .",
    "we anticipate here that all the terms appearing in the averages are proportional to either @xmath78 , when coming from a left - chamber average , or @xmath79 when coming from a right - chamber average .",
    "there is no other dependence on @xmath37 or @xmath0 in equations  ( [ eq : x]-[eq : temp ] ) and , consequently , eqs .",

    "we detail the procedure by which the averages can be computed .      in order to finalize our program",
    "we have now to make explicit the averages in ( [ eq2:vx]-[eq2:tr ] ) .",

    "let us now derive @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "we start by the equilibrium distribution of the gases , which is uniform in the particle positions @xmath133 and maxwell - boltzmann for the velocities @xmath30 : @xmath134 that , under our assumptions , describe the gases at all times .",
    "note that the above distributions depend ( parametrically ) on the dynamical variables @xmath37 and @xmath28 .    from the equilibrium joint distributions ( [ eq : equilibrio ] ) we can derive the probability density @xmath135 that a particle on the left / right collides in a time @xmath29 given its velocity @xmath30 and the macroscopic state of the system defined by the temperatures , the piston position @xmath37 and velocity @xmath63 and the equation of state .",
    "of course , most of the weight to such an hitting probability comes from particles that are close to the piston and that have a large ( negative ) relative velocity with it .",
    "these particles are far from the bulk of the gas and in this derivation we assume that we can use the evolution of free particles to compute their hitting time with the piston .",

    "it is worth noticing that for the ideal gas , since the molecules interact only through the collisions with the piston , the probability distribution of the velocities of the gas molecules may ( and actually do ) deviate sensibly from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution that is recovered only after the reaching of the final equilibrium state  @xcite . by construction , this problem is not present in the randomized gas which is forced to remain maxwell - boltzmann .    in the following",

    "note that the simulation has been performed with @xmath204 because the time scale for reaching the equilibrium is controlled by @xmath13 ; with @xmath201 , as here , working with @xmath205 would have implied the necessity to reach too large time scales to study the relaxation .",
    "as shown in the figure , the macroscopic equations ( dashed line ) predict a relaxation slower than both the randomized and ideal gases .",
    "this came out as a surprise for us , because we were encouraged by the very good agreement in the mechanical regime , discussed in the previous section .",

    "we remark that going to higher order in their approach requires to include into the description also higher order moments of the piston velocity , namely @xmath216 ; while within our approach the description remains at the level of the second order moment because the statistics is constrained to remain gaussian ( maxwell - boltzmann ) for the gases and the piston",

    "their equations at the first order might likely correspond to a resummation of higher order terms in our approach , meaning that their closure with the second moment of the velocity is exact while ours remains only approximate .",
    "in the framework of kinetic theory , we derived a set of deterministic equations describing the evolution of the macroscopic variables in the adiabatic piston problem .",
