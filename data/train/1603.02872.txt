    "in spin glasses , frustration is an essential ingredient of the glassiness  @xcite , responsible for nonequilibrium phenomena such as memory effects .",

    "for example , the peculiar dynamical response observed in triangular - based organic systems  @xcite has been intensively discussed recently in terms of geometrical frustration .",
    "indeed , while geometrically frustrated magnets lack disorder to generate a rugged energy landscape , they have topology as a new ingredient for the generation of slow dynamics : in the simplest terms , gauge - charged topological defects can not spontaneously disappear but rather only pair - annihilate with an oppositely charged partner .",
    "this provides connections to the physics of reaction - diffusion systems , as well as to the coarsening literature , and more generally to the study of kinetically constrained models  @xcite .",
    "while such topological constraints provide hard conditions on the kinds of allowed dynamical processes , they can be supplemented by soft yet important , non - topological energetic considerations .",
    "adding short - range interactions between topological defects can give rise to a rich phenomenology which has not yet been thoroughly or systematically explored  for a case study of quantum hall physics and the links to different types of superconductivity , see ref .  [ ] .",

    "this phenomenon has invited several interpretations , such as chiral spin liquid formation  @xcite .",
    "possibly , this spontaneous hall effect may alternatively be attributed to the nature of low - energy excitations .",
    "the initial state obviously breaks time - reversal symmetry under a magnetic field , and naturally shows a finite hall response . accordingly , if there exist non - magnetic excitations which somehow encode the information of time - reversal symmetry breaking , then the population of these excitations reflect the broken time - reversal symmetry of the initial state , and the hall response might persist for a period after the field quench . moreover , if the excitation has a long lifetime , and do not relax within observable time scales , even the  steady \" state may retain a finite hall response .",

    "non - contractible pairs of monopoles are formed through the attractive interaction between monopoles , and they exhibit long lifetime@xcite , as their pair annihilation can only proceed across an energy barrier . the formation of composite excitations may also occur in metallic spin ice , where the magnetic moments interact through an rkky - type interaction , where the farther - neighbor interaction brings about effective interactions between topological defects .",

    "the behavior of these charges is the subject of our analysis of their stochastic dynamics .",
    "the dynamical bottleneck caused by the jellyfish excitations leads to the possibility of interesting memory effects , including an emergent chiral degree of freedom which carries zero magnetization .",
    "indeed , the ring part of jellyfish carries a clockwise or counterclockwise circular flow of magnetization , which gives it a well - defined toroidal moment .",
    "the stability of jellyfish excitations implies a slow relaxation of these toroidal moments .",
    "accordingly , once the system is subject to a perturbation which breaks time - reversal symmetry , e.g. a magnetic field , this symmetry breaking can in principle persist for a long time , even after relaxation of the magnetization . in the context of a magnetic field",

    "the jellyfish structure is quite stable . accordingly , the toroidal moment associated with its ring part has quite a long lifetime . here , we discuss two dominant processes which collapse the ring structure and destroy the toroidal moment , accordingly .",

    "accordingly , if there is a jellyfish composed of a certain numbers of positive charges , there must be the same numbers of negative charges elsewhere in the system , which is likely to form a jellyfish or methane cluster to lower their energy , near @xmath17 . under the circumstances , to destroy the positive jellyfish",
    ", one can consider the following three - step process : ( i ) one monopole is detached from the negative jellyfish / methane , ( ii ) it migrates to the positive jellyfish , and ( iii ) makes a pair - annihilation with one of the positive charges composing the target positive jellyfish .",
    "the energy barrier accompanying ( i ) is at least @xmath369 .",

    "however , if there are finite numbers of stray charges , possibly due to thermal excitation , the step ( i ) is not necessary . in this case , @xmath370 is reduced to @xmath372 , and it gives a comparable value to the lower bound of double charge - vacuum creation energy barrier : @xmath373 , near @xmath17 .",

    "this process involves the migration of charge , which we call step ( ii ) above .",
    "if the charge density is low , the charge has to migrate for quite a long time until it successfully go overs the energy barrier due to the step ( iii ) .",
