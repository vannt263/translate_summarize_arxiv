    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with high precisions are of great importance in modern cosmology , since it is the most powerful way to understand the origin and evolution of our universe .",
    "it is commonly believed that currently observed cmb anisotropies and large scale structure are originated from the quantum fluctuations at very early times preceding the hot expansion .",
    "theoretical hypothesis about this very early universe includes inflation @xcite , ekpyrotic / cyclic universe @xcite and so on . according to these theories",
    "the universe was smoothed and flattened at the early epoch , and at the same time the quantum fluctuations from vacuum extended outside the horizon and formed the primordial perturbations , i.e. , the initial conditions of cosmic structure formation .",
    "the primordial perturbations can be decomposed into three types : scalar , vector and tensor perturbations .",
    "the scalar perturbations cause the anisotropies of cmb and the structure formation of large scale structure , while the vector perturbations , correspond to vortices decline rapidly during the expanding universe and can be neglected at later time ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more interestingly , the tensor perturbations , i.e. , the primordial gravitational waves @xcite leave the unique imprint on the large scales power spectrum of cmb b - modes polarization @xcite .",
    "therefore , probes of cmb primordial b - modes polarization are always treated as crucial ways to test the early universe models .",
    "searching for the primordial gravitational waves is one of the key scientific goals of the cmb polarization experiments , such as the bicep3 @xcite , the ebex @xcite , the spt polarization @xcite and the act polarization @xcite .    in order to describe the primordial tensor perturbations",
    ", we usually use the amplitude parameter , the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the power spectra of tensor and scalar perturbations . due to the precision limitations of current cmb experiments ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath0 are still weak and consistent with zero very well @xcite . in 2014 , the bicep2 collaboration published their final three - year cmb observational data and announced the detection of cmb b - modes polarization at scales @xmath8 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath9 , and the null detection ( @xmath10 ) is disfavored at about @xmath11 .    however , few months later , the planck collaboration measured the angular power spectra of the polarized thermal emission from diffuse galactic dust , which is the main foreground present in measurements of the cmb polarization at frequencies above 100 ghz @xcite , and pointed out that the contribution of thermal dust on the cmb bb power spectrum has been significantly underestimated in the bicep2 foreground analyses @xcite .",
    "they found that the magnitude of the bb power spectrum , contributed by the polarized thermal dust emission , at 150 ghz in the sky field observed by the bicep2 experiment is at the same level as the one predicted by the early universe model with the primordial gravitational waves @xmath9 . when the polarized dust contribution is properly taken into account ,",
    "the joint analysis of the bicep2/keck and planck collaborations preferred the null detection of the primordial gravitational waves and obtained the upper limit of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath12 at 95% confidence level @xcite .",
    "besides the polarized thermal dust emission , the cosmic birefringence can also generate the cmb b - modes polarization at large scales .",
    "this phenomenon can be introduced by the interaction between cmb photons and the external scalar field @xmath13 through the chern - simons ( cs ) term @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the dual of the electromagnetic tensor .",
    "this coupling is gauge invariant if @xmath16 .",
    "this is possible if @xmath13 is a constant field over the spacetime or arises from the derivative of a cosmic scalar field @xmath17 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath17 can be identified as the dark energy in the quintessential baryo-/leptogenesis @xcite and as the ricci scalar @xmath18 in the gravitational baryo-/leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the cs term violates the lorentz and cpt symmetries spontaneously if @xmath13 has nonzero background values .",
    "this induces rotations of polarization directions of the propagating photons @xcite and productions of cmb tb and eb cross - correlations , even though they are absent before the recombination in the traditional cmb theory @xcite .",
    "the crucial point for this paper is that this phenomenon provides a mechanism to produce the cmb b - modes , alternative to the primordial gravitational waves and weak lensing . because the rotation converts part of e - modes polarization to b - modes polarization , even the primordial b - modes polarization is absent , sizable cmb b - modes power spectrum",
    "can still be obtained from the e - modes power spectrum through the rotation .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the cosmological birefringence degenerates with primordial tensor mode perturbations at large scales and with the gravitational lensing at small scales , respectively . and due to this degeneracy , considering the anisotropic polarization rotation could slightly lower the best - fit value of @xmath0 and relax the tension on the constraints of @xmath0 between from bicep2 and from planck 2013 data @xcite , even without the help of the isotropic part of the rotation angle , which is removed by the `` self - calibration '' method in the bicep2 data analysis @xcite .    therefore , it is important and necessary to study the influences of the polarization rotation angle on the measurements of cmb primordial tensor perturbations using the current and future cmb experiments",
    ". recently , @xcite found that constraints on the tensor - to - scalar ratio could be significantly biased , when the isotropic rotation angle can not be taken into account properly . in this paper , our main task is to focus on the influences of the anisotropic polarization rotation angle on the detection of primordial gravitational waves by performing the global fitting with the latest cmb datasets and simulated mock data of future cmb experiments included .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ theory ] we briefly introduce the cosmic birefringence mechanism and the effects on cmb polarization power spectra from the isotropic and anisotropic polarization rotation angle .",
    "section [ result ] contains our main results from the current observations and future measurements , while section [ summary ] is dedicated to the conclusions and discussions .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the cosmic birefringence which has been widely studied in the literatures @xcite .",
    "we consider the cs coupling between the cosmic scalar field @xmath17 and the electromagnetic field : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an arbitrary function of @xmath17 . as mentioned before",
    ", the cs term violates lorentz and cpt symmetries but not the gauge symmetry of the electromagnetic field , so will not change the number of dynamical components of photons .",
    "however , the states with opposite helicity propagates with different velocities , so that the polarization vectors of photons will not be parallel transported along the light rays .",
    "consequently the observed polarization directions are changed by rotations when compared with the original directions at the source .    in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the rotated linear polarization state ( denoted by a prime )",
    "is related to the unrotated one through @xmath23 the rotation angle @xmath24 corresponds to the cpt violation and is frequency independent .",
    "it can be calculated by the integration along the light rays @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the affine parameter of the light ray , the subscripts @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the source and the observer , respectively .",
    "naturally , we observe cmb photons at a single point , hence @xmath29 should be a constant .",
    "however the dynamical field @xmath17 is expected to fluctuate on the last scattering surface ( lss ) .",
    "the observer at the fixed position receives cmb photons from all directions and will find that the rotation angle varies across the sky , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the anisotropies are proportional to the distribution of @xmath17 on the lss , which means we can separate the rotation angle @xmath24 into the isotropic part and the small anisotropic one as follows @xmath30 with @xmath31-f(\\phi_0)~,\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta\\alpha(\\hat{\\bf n})&=&\\frac{df}{d\\phi}\\delta\\phi(\\vec{x}_{\\rm lss } , \\eta_{\\rm lss})~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the position and the conformal time on the last scattering surface . for the isotropic part @xmath34 ,",
    "the first evidence in terms of the full cmb datasets was done in @xcite and stimulated many interests in this field ( see @xcite , and references within ) .",
    "assuming the anisotropic rotation angle @xmath4 is a zero mean field defined on two dimensional sphere , it can be decomposed in terms of spherical harmonics : @xmath35 furthermore , if we assume the perturbation field @xmath4 is a gaussian random field and satisfies the statistical isotropy , so we can define the angular power spectrum of the anisotropic rotation angle : @xmath36 in this paper we set @xmath37 for simplicity , in which @xmath38 represents the cut - off mass in the effective field theory and @xmath39 stands for the dimensionless coupling coefficient .",
    "we find the relationship between the angular power spectrum of anisotropic rotation angle @xmath40 and the power spectrum of the scalar field @xmath41 at the lss @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fourier transform of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the spherical bessel function .",
    "@xcite has considered several specific dark energy models , such as the massless scalar field and the quintessence field , and then calculated their power spectra explicitly . in this paper",
    "we study the constraint on the perturbations of this scalar field through the polarization rotation angle in a model - independent way .",
    "it is convenient to expand its power spectrum on the super hubble scale , just as what we usually do in the study of slow - roll inflation , @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent the amplitude and spectral index of the power spectrum and the pivot scale , respectively . due to the precision limitation of current cmb experiments",
    ", we set @xmath48 to be zero and neglect the higher order running parameters of the spectral index [ @xmath50 in the following calculations .    in order to investigate the influence on the cmb polarization power spectra due to the cosmic polarization rotation angle",
    ", we firstly define two - point correlation function using the following relation @xmath51 where @xmath52 corresponds to the angle between these two directions , @xmath53 . combining eqs .",

    "( [ newcmb ] ) we have separated the influences of isotropic and anisotropic polarization rotation angle .",
    "it is apparently that they both get involved in all scales of cmb polarization power spectra .",
    "the isotropic rotation angle copies the original cmb ee power spectrum , zooms it out and then prints it onto the rotated bb power spectrum .",
    "it will inevitably create additional cmb tb and eb power spectra which should be vanished in normal cmb theories .",
    "we can see the terms @xmath59 or @xmath60 appear as coefficients in almost all equations .",
    "this suggests us that the isotropic rotation angle should perform a global modulation on rotated cmb power spectra if it exists .",
    "however , the situation for the anisotropic one is somehow different .",
    "non - zero tb and eb spectra are not longer necessary if the isotropic part [ @xmath61 vanishes , which is consistent with some current cmb experiments .",
    "the bicep2/keck array collaboration has used the `` self - calibration '' method for the detector polarization orientations , and as a result , any signal of the isotropic polarization rotation angle has been eliminated from data .",

    "@xmath64 , the contribution on bb power spectrum from the anisotropic polarization rotational angle can be negligible . therefore , probing the reionization bump of cmb bb power spectrum at very large scale may provide a smoking gun for distinguishing the polarization rotational angle and primordial gravitational waves .",
    "in this paper we perform a global analysis to all the power spectra of the cmb data with the public available markov chain monte carlo package cosmomc @xcite , which has been modified to compute the rotated cmb polarization power spectra discussed above .",
