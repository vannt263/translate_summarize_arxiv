    "as we have four independent co line ratios , single - component co models are , in principle , fully constrained by the four adjustable parameters . in practice ,",
    "relatively large observational uncertainties allow only fitting of three parameters as a function of the fourth , for which we have chosen @xmath31 = 6 , 10 and 14 k. neutral carbon column densities are adjusted to yield , at the relevant kinetic temperature , the observed [ ci]/@xmath1 ( 21 ) ratio of 0.24 . by combining these with the model calculations of van dishoeck @xmath13 black ( 1988 )",

    "brinks @xmath13 shane ( 1984 ) we find a neutral hydrogen column density @xmath52 = 1.8 @xmath6 10@xmath53 @xmath54 at the position of d  478 .",
    "parameters thus determined for single - component models are shown in table 2 , together with corresponding model line ratios .",
    "although these models generally yield greater differences between the @xmath1 ( 2 - 1)/(1 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 2)/(2 - 1 ) ratios than observed , the 14 k model fits the observations within the errors .",
    "the 10 k model is barely consistent and the 6 k model fails to reproduce the observed ratios , predicting too low a @xmath1 @xmath12 = 32 strength .",
    "loinard @xmath13 allen ( 1998 ) have argued that the @xmath1 structure of d  478 can be explained by a large , dense and very smooth cloud in lte at even lower temperatures close to that of the cosmic background .",
    "although it is possible to reproduce the @xmath1 line ratios in this manner , the observed @xmath2 ( 21)/(10 ) ratio of about 0.5 is only obtained at high @xmath2 optical depths requiring @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios of order unity , which is clearly not the case .",
    "alternatively , the observed @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios can be reproduced with lower @xmath2 optical depths satisfying one of the two observed @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios , but the @xmath2 ( 21)/(10 ) ratio then is only a third of the actually observed value .    for such reasons , allen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) concluded to the necessity of a model incorporating at least two components . in their analysis , they modelled the co emission from d  478 with two different density / temperature components , and showed that the observed line ratios are , for instance , reproduced by a cold low - density gas ( @xmath55 = 4 k , @xmath56 = 100 @xmath57 , d@xmath27 = 5 @xmath20 ) and a high - density gas ( @xmath58 = 7 k , @xmath56 = 3000 @xmath57 , d@xmath27 = 10 @xmath20 ) , both with a low surface - filling factor .",
    "we have also calculated two - component models .",
    "as there are eleven adjustable parameters ( six column densities , two densities , two temperatures and the relative contributions of the two components to the total emission ) , no unique solution can be obtained .",
    "we have chosen to model the same @xmath8 densities as given in the example by allen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and similar @xmath1 column densities , and calculate the remaining parameters as a function of temperature .",
    "furthermore , we require the column density ratio of the tenuous and the dense components to be the same for @xmath2 and for @xmath1 . over the range of applicable parameters ,",
    "the [ ci ] emission from the dense component is more efficiently produced ( i.e. characterized by a higher ratio of [ ci ] intensity to carbon column density ) than that from the tenuous component . by taking the maximum permissible contribution from the dense component , and ascribing the remainder to the tenuous component , we have minimized overall neutral carbon column densities required , and thus maximized permitted total hydrogen column densities .",
    "although other combinations of input parameters are possible , the range of admissible parameters is nevertheless limited by the observations .",
    "for instance , changes in the assumed @xmath8 densities and @xmath1 column densities , immediately require adjustment of the relative weights of the two components in order to reproduce the same line ratios which tends to minimize the effect of these changes on the parameter ratios as well .    in table 2",
    ", we present four such cases , for temperatures varying from 6 to 14 k. as an example , the 6/6 k case corresponds closest to the example given by allen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , with the surface filling factor of the low - density component twice that of the high - density component . for this case",
    ", we obtain a reasonable fit for a @xmath1/@xmath2 column - density ratio of 360 . if , instead , we require the column density ratio to be 90 , @xmath2 optical depths increase significantly and we obtain for the same relative filling factors a @xmath1/@xmath2 _ temperature _ ratio of less than 4 , inconsistent with the observed values .",
    "this may be repaired by increasing the relative filling factors to 1:6 or higher , but then the @xmath1 @xmath12=21/@xmath12=10 and especially the @xmath12=32/@xmath12=21 ratios drop to unacceptably low values of 0.32 and 0.19 respectively .",
    "as table 2 shows , increasing the temperature generally leads to higher @xmath40 ratios , lower ratios of neutral carbon to co column density and a lower required contribution of the dense component .",
    "the dense component has low @xmath59 ratios characteristic of giant molecular cloud complexes in the milky way ( 0.10.2 : keene et al .",
    "1985 ) , whereas the tenuous component exhibits ratios similar to those found in galactic translucent and dark clouds ( 0.33 : stark @xmath13 van dishoeck 1994 ; stark et al . 1996 ) .",
    "if we increase the temperature of the dense component over that of the tenuous component , the @xmath2 column densities change only by a small amount , the implied c column densities decrease and the relative contribution of the tenuous component also decreases . the predicted line ratios ,",
    "although somewhat different , are consistent with the observed ratios .",
    "thus , from a radiative - transfer point of view , the temperature of d  478 is not strongly constrained in a two - component model , although we note that the higher temperature ( 10/10 k and 10/14 k ) models give slightly better fits to the observed line ratios . in the models in table 2 ,",
    "the [ ci ] emission is optically thick at 6 k , and optically thin at 14 k. in all cases , the expected strength of the 809 ghz line is ( much ) less than 10 per cent of that of the 492 ghz line . as neutral",
    "carbon radiates ineffectively at temperatures below 10 k , the observed [ ci ] intensity rapidly requires very large c column densities and high @xmath59 ratios if lower temperatures are assumed .",
    "this again rules out satisfactory solutions at very low temperatures .",

    "more reasonable carbon abundances would imply higher @xmath8 column densities and projected gas mass densities , but the large neutral carbon column densities required by the observed line strength at the assumed temperature of 6 k would then imply @xmath59 ratios much larger than allowed at such column densities .    with increasing temperature , the co and [ ci ] column densities required by the observed line emission become more modest . because the carbon / hydrogen column density ratio also drops , total hydrogen and molecular hydrogen column densities change relatively little . at these temperatures , @xmath90 , which corresponds to a total carbon abundance [ c]/[h ] @xmath91 if @xmath92 = 0.4 .",
    "this is about 2.5 times the value ascribed to the solar neighbourhood , and close to the value expected from the extrapolation of m  31 disk abundances .",
    "the co intensity to @xmath8 column density value for these models is relatively well - determined with @xmath9 = 0.9@xmath930.3 @xmath94 mol cm@xmath11 @xmath78 , or about half of the solar neighbourhood value .",
    "projected mass densities are in the range of 59 m@xmath10 pc@xmath11 .",
    "surface filling factors for the emission within the beam are given in table 3 for both the high - density and the low - density components ; the ratio of the two is for each model , of course , equal to the ratio of the weights given in table 2 .",
    "again , the lower temperature models have the largest filling factors .",
    "the two models with dense gas temperatures of 10 k yield surface filling factors of 6@xmath76 for the dense gas and about 30@xmath76 for the tenuous gas .",
    "these values appear to be consistent with the small fraction ( 15@xmath76 ) of the single - dish co flux recovered in the interferometric map by loinard @xmath13 allen ( 1998 ) .",
    "the model @xmath8 column densities divided by the input @xmath8 densities provides a measure for the line - of - sight depth z through the clouds in the emitting surface fraction .",
    "for the two - component models in table 3 , we find 0.3 pc < @xmath95 < 0.7",
    "pc and 4.5 pc < @xmath96 < 7.5 pc .",
    "the subscripts @xmath97 and @xmath98 refer to the dense and the tenuous components respectively , and the larger depths occur at the higher temperatures .",
    "both the surface filling factors and the subcloud depths suggest that the structure of d  478 is highly fragmented and filamentary .    the models discussed do not fully constrain the physical conditions applying to d  478 .",
    "various other combinations of parameters could be used as input .",
    "multi - density models incorporating temperature gradients might be better representations of the actual structure of d  478 , and could easily be made to satisfy the observations .",
    "for instance , adding a contribution of material at intermediate densities and temperatures to the two - component models in table 2 within the limits imposed by observed line ratios would indeed change the detailed set of physical parameters , but would not substantially change the overall result .",
    "we conclude that the observations of d  478 , and in particular the relatively strong [ ci ] emission appear to rule out the presence of very large amounts of molecular gas at very low temperatures in this complex . at the very least , our models show that there is no compelling need to assume such a state of affairs .",
    "the interferometric results obtained by loinard @xmath13 allen ( 1998 ) indicate a relatively small contribution by dense , compact material .",
    "this suggests that the 10/10 k and 10/14 k models with their small surface - filling fraction of the dense component are a better representation than the lower - temperature models .",
    "most likely , d  478 is rather similar to dark cloud complexes in our own galaxy , at the higher metallicity consistent with its central location in m  31 .",
    "it has a modest projected mass density and a relatively low @xmath9-factor , both of which are consistent with this conclusion .",
    "a comparison with the galactic taurus - auriga dark cloud complex at a distance of 140 pc is illustrative .",
    "we have already noted similar [ ci]/@xmath99co ( 2 - 1 ) ratios ( schilke et al .",
    "1995 ) . likewise , the taurus @xmath100co ( 21)/(10 ) ratio of 0.53 ( sakamoto et al .",
    "1997 ) is close to that of d  478 .",
    "more in detail , an area 30@xmath87 ( 80 pc ) across was mapped in co by ungerechts @xmath13 thaddeus ( 1987 ) . ignoring the more distant and unrelated clouds , we find that the mean integrated line intensity of the complex is 4.5 @xmath101 with individual clouds having intensities between 3 and 15 @xmath101 .",
    "the surface filling factor of the complex is 0.3 , and its appearance is indeed very fragmented and clumpy .",
    "the complex has a mean mass - density d@xmath69/d@xmath70 = 7 m@xmath10pc@xmath11 .",
    "both the observed line ratios and the derived quantities thus suggest that d  478 is similar to a larger version of the taurus - auriga dark cloud complex .    assuming an overall cloud size of 1@xmath102 ( allen",
    "@xmath13 lequeux 1993 ) and including a contribution by helium , the gas mass of d  478 is of the order of 1 @xmath6 10@xmath103 m@xmath10 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude lower than the virial mass deduced by allen @xmath13 lequeux ( 1993 ) and loinard @xmath13 allen ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , it is doubtful whether molecular cloud complexes are virialized at all .",
    "moreover , the shape of the line profiles of d  478 suggests the presence of at least two distinct components .",
    "its location near the tangential point of a rapidly rotating structure with noncircular motions suggests that various individual clouds , separated by significant distances , may be seen with very similar velocities in the same line of sight ; the appearance of the hi distribution in the position - velocity maps published by brinks @xmath13 shane ( 1984 ) lends credibility to this suggestion . in this respect",
    "it is relevant to note that the velocity width of line spectra incorporating emission of various unrelated clouds in the same beam will reflect the cloud - cloud velocity dispersion of about 9 @xmath20 ( stark 1979 ) in addition to any systematic velocity shifts and the velocity widths of the individual clouds .",
    "applying the virial equation to such a collection of clouds will lead to a potentially large overestimate of the actual mass .",
    "1 .   we have detected the 492 ghz emission line from the @xmath0 transition towards the dark cloud d  478 in m  31 .",
    "the [ ci ] line strength is comparable to that of @xmath2 @xmath12=10 and about twice as strong as that of the @xmath2 @xmath12=21 transition .",
    "this is similar to the intensity ratios found in galactic dark and translucent clouds .",
    "2 .   we have used @xmath1 and @xmath2 intensities from the literature together with the newly determined [ ci ] intensity to model conditions in the d  478 cloud complex .",
    "we have considered both single - density filamentary clouds and two - density core / envelope clouds .",
    "in particular , inhomogeneous ( two - component ) models produce good fits to the observations .",
    "dense core @xmath59 ratios are found to be similar to those of giant molecular clouds in the milky way , whereas the ratios derived for the extended more tenous gas are similar to those found in galactic dark and translucent clouds .",
    "3 .   d  478 appears to be similar to galactic dark cloud complexes , such as the taurus - auriga dark cloud complex .",
    "most likely , it is characterized by a higher metallicity consistent with an extrapolation of m  31 disk abundances to its central location in the galaxy .",
    "its kinetic temperature is of the order of 10 k. there appears to be no need to assign very low temperatures and very high @xmath8 mass densities to the d  478 complex ; our results do not support the virial mass surface densities of d  478 of @xmath104100 m@xmath10pc@xmath11 suggested by loinard @xmath13 allen ( 1998 ) .",
    "4 .   actual cloud mass densities projected onto the m  31 midplane are of the order of 510 m@xmath10pc@xmath11 .",
    "the co to @xmath8 conversion factor is @xmath9 = 0.9@xmath290.3 @xmath6 10@xmath53 cm@xmath11 @xmath78 , about half the value in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the d  478 complex may not be a single entity , but instead may consist of various clouds at different locations projected onto the same line - of - sight towards the tangential direction of a rapidly rotating structure characterized by noncircular velocities .",
    "we are indebted to ewine van dishoeck and david jansen from the leiden astrochemistry group for letting us use their statistical equilibrium calculation models and benefitted from discussions with ewine van dishoeck .",
    "we also thank james lequeux for kindly providing us with the unpublished full - resolution parameters of the @xmath1 @xmath12=21 profile of d  478 .",
    "critical remarks on an earlier draft by ron allen and lasurent loinard led to a substantial improvement in the paper .",
