    "equivalence between mass and energy is a cornerstone of special relativity , yet the formal derivations provide little physical intuition .",
    "students can calculate quantitatively correct values for the masses of different configurations , e.g. a capacitor with varying plate separation , but often gain little or no qualitative understanding of the mechanisms which produce the differences .",
    "one of the primary mechanisms has been understood , at least in principle , since the 1881 observation of j.j .",
    "thomson that a charged , accelerating sphere experiences a `` back - reaction '' force from its own electromagnetic ( em ) field , which acts to resist the acceleration and effectively increases the mass of the sphere.@xcite this effect , and its extension to other systems of charges such as capacitors or atomic bound states , provides the mechanism by which internal em energy contributes to the overall mass of a system .",
    "the magnetic component of the em back - reaction should already be familiar to most students as the phenomenon of self - induction .",
    "different charge configurations lead to different back - reaction forces , which , along with internal kinetic energy such as electron orbital motion , accounts for most of the mass differential between different states of ordinary matter .",
    "moreover , as has been emphasized by wilczek,@xcite back - reaction of the strong nuclear force accounts for most of the mass of protons and neutrons , only a small fraction of which comes from the intrinsic ( or higgs - derived ) quark masses .",
    "students who have studied self - induction therefore understand , in essence , one of the primary sources of mass in the universe , as well as one of the principal mechanisms of mass / energy equivalence , but they may not be aware of these connections .    given the centrality of this mechanism it would be beneficial to expose students to it , for example by computing back - reaction in simple classical configurations and showing its effect on mass .",
    "however , a vexing problem arises : computations of this sort do not give correct answers .",
    "one expects to find that the mass contributed by back - reaction equals the stored em energy divided by @xmath0 , as predicted by einstein s formula , but model computations give answers differing from this by geometry - dependent factors , most notoriously the factor 4/3 for spherically symmetric cases ; indeed , the problem has come to be known as the `` 4/3 problem''.@xcite    an explanation for such discrepancies was proposed long ago by poincar , who noted that the charge distributions appearing in classical models are unstable and require additional forces to stabilize them.@xcite adding in the energy and momentum contributions from these `` poincar stresses '' compensates the discrepancy and allows the overall momentum and energy to transform properly as a 4-vector.@xcite    poincar stresses do resolve the problem , but when treated generically they leave the mechanism rather obscure , and the focus on additional forces is confusing since everyday matter is , in fact , constructed from em forces and charged particles .",
    "here we clarify how the problem is resolved within realistic atomic matter , with the aim of encouraging classroom discussion of back - reaction examples .",
    "the 4/3 problem has , of course , been discussed many times previously , but most often in the context of constructing classical models of the electron , which is not our present interest.@xcite    we view this as part of a broader effort to introduce more qualitative or constructive explanations into the teaching of special relativity , with the goal of improving students intuition for relativistic effects and showing how those effects connect to prior elements of the physics curriculum.@xcite no originality is claimed for the calculations to follow , and references have been cited when known .",
    "natural units @xmath1 will be used throughout , and `` mostly - plus '' metric signature @xmath2.@xcite greek indices @xmath3 refer to 4-space coordinates , while @xmath4 refer to 3-space , with repeated indices summed in both cases .",
    "perhaps the simplest configuration in which to study em back - reaction is the parallel - plate capacitor , fig.[fig : cap ] .",
    "this also provides a model for bound states in general , since varying the separation of the plates changes the internal em energy just as , e.g. , for different atomic levels .",
    "we consider a capacitor having square plates with sides of length @xmath5 parallel to the @xmath6 , @xmath7 axes , separated by distance @xmath8 in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "the top plate holds uniform surface charge density @xmath10 and the bottom plate @xmath11 , leading to the electric field @xmath12 .",
    "the question to be answered is how much of the mass of the capacitor is due to its em field .",
    "according to einstein s formula the answer should be @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the em field energy , given by @xmath15    one measures mass by trying to accelerate the system , i.e. by applying a force and measuring the total impulse required for the system to attain a given speed .",
    "assuming that the external force does nt interact with the internal em field directly , the only way in which the internal em field affects this measurement is through back - reaction onto the charges .",
    "we consider first accelerating the capacitor in the @xmath16 direction , in which case the back - reaction takes the form of self - induction .",
    "as the charges accelerate , a magnetic field @xmath17 develops between the plates , parallel to @xmath18 .",
    "the growing b - field in turn creates an e - field which acts back on the charges , opposing the acceleration . instead of following this process explicitly",
    ", we will calculate the total back - reaction impulse in a more general way which applies more easily to other configurations .",
    "the back - reaction is just force applied by the em field , i.e. , momentum exchanged between the field and the matter .",
    "the total back - reaction impulse generated by an em field between two time points is therefore the negative of the change in the em field momentum .",
    "the em field momentum is given by the poynting vector@xcite @xmath19 and we note that the capacitor has @xmath20 when at rest .",
    "the cumulative back - reaction impulse from accelerating the capacitor to velocity @xmath21 is then found by calculating @xmath22 for the moving system , a calculation which is often quite easy because one can use a lorentz transformation to find the em field of the moving system .    here , and",
    "in the remainder of the paper , we consider only small velocities , and work to first order in @xmath21 .",
    "first - order calculations suffice to determine the effective mass and exhibit the primary back - reaction mechanisms , while simplifying the calculations greatly",
    ".    the expected em momentum in light of einstein s formula ( eq.[expect ] ) would be @xmath23 but the actual situation is not so simple . applying the standard lorentz transformation of the em field",
    ", the boosted state acquires a magnetic field @xmath24 , leading to momentum@xcite @xmath25 a formula which applies to any configuration having negligible initial b - field .    for the capacitor accelerated along @xmath16 ,",
    "the second term vanishes , and by comparing with eqs.([hem],[emlor ] ) one sees immediately that the result is too large by a factor of two ! hence , although the example clearly shows a qualitative effect of back - reaction on mass , it does not successfully reproduce the quantitative mass / energy relation .    for acceleration in the @xmath26 direction",
    "the situation is equally perplexing , for no b - field is generated and the final em momentum is also zero.@xcite it would appear that there is no back - reaction at all , hence no contribution from the em energy to the mass of the system .",
    "one might say that the @xmath16 case has a `` factor of two '' discrepancy , while the @xmath26 case has a `` factor of zero '' discrepancy .",
    "in fact the discrepancy was discovered in studying spherically - symmetric geometries ( models of the electron ) and has long been referred to as the `` @xmath27 problem '' , after the factor which is found for these cases .",
    "we note that , in addition to self - induction , one must usually also include electrostatic self - forces ; however , eq.([boostedp ] ) remains valid .",
    "if the momentum stored in the em field does not account for the relativistically - required contribution eq.([emlor ] ) , the difference must be stored somewhere else , since the underlying theory of quantum electrodynamics does respect both momentum conservation and lorentz invariance .",
    "the only place additional momentum could be stored is in the surrounding atomic material of the capacitor , hence there must be a compensating momentum discrepancy in the atomic matter ; in other words , the total momentum of the electrons and nuclei in the moving atomic system must also differ from that expected by simply applying einstein s formula ( the analog of eq.[emlor ] for the matter subsystem ) . in the following sections we show how this `` matter momentum discrepancy '' arises .    for future reference",
    "we show the general form of the em momentum discrepancy , obtained by subtracting eq.([emlor ] ) from eq.([boostedp ] ) : @xmath28",
    "if matter consisted of a static assembly of components then it would be hard to see how an object could harbor any momentum beyond that of its bulk motion ; however , the modern view of matter involves a great deal of internal motion which can , in fact , develop a net momentum in relativistic theories .",
    "we consider first a classical atomic model consisting of a uniformly distributed ring of identical charged particles in circular orbits at fixed radius around a central charged nucleus .",
    "we neglect radiation , and assume that the total orbiting charge density is small enough that the charges have negligible effect on each other s motion .",
    "the force on a charge @xmath29 located at position @xmath30 relative to the nucleus is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is constant .",
    "when the system ( i.e. , the nucleus ) is at rest , the orbital momenta of the charges cancel and add nothing to the total momentum . in newtonian physics",
    "this would also be true of the moving system , but in a relativistic theory it need not be .",
    "we consider boosting the system to a small velocity @xmath21 , where @xmath21 lies in the plane of the orbits ( fig.[fig : boost ] ) .",
    "the orbits remain circular to first order , since length contraction starts at @xmath33 , but they receive two types of first - order correction .    first , the orbital velocities are altered due to the relativistic addition - of - velocity formula . this change does not , however , lead to any momentum discrepancy , since it corresponds to taking a snapshot of the particle momenta at a fixed time and then lorentz - transforming them all .",
    "the resulting total @xmath34-momentum is just the lorentz transform of the original total @xmath34-momentum , with no extra discrepancy ; in other words , this part gives rise to the analog of eq.([emlor ] ) for the orbiting particles .",
    "transforming all the momenta in a fixed - time snapshot does not , however , give an accurate picture of the moving system , since the definition of fixed time differs between frames .",
    "because the orbiting particles are continually accelerating , this difference can translate into an extra contribution to the total momentum . more concretely",
    ", the varying orbital velocities of the particles also imply a varying density , which creates net momentum .",
    "it is easiest to calculate the momentum discrepancy directly in terms of the internal force @xmath35 and the relativistic simultaneity change .",
    "the boosted trajectories are obtained , to first order , by substituting the coordinate change @xmath36 into the rest - frame trajectories .",
    "the momentum discrepancy arises from the simultaneity shift , @xmath37 which effectively shifts the particles forwards or backwards in their trajectories by @xmath38 , giving rise to the density shifts shown schematically in fig.[fig : boost ] . during time @xmath38",
    ", a particle at location @xmath30 changes its momentum by @xmath39 , hence the overall momentum discrepancy is @xmath40 in the last line , the equation has been written in more general form as an integral against the orbital charge distribution @xmath41 , anticipating calculations to follow .     at right",
    "indicate the sign of @xmath38 , eq.8 . ]    for the circular orbits of the model , @xmath42 is nonzero since both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are odd under reflection through the origin ; hence , the orbital momentum develops a discrepancy , and the next step is to compare this to the em momentum discrepancy , eq.([discp ] ) . for this",
    "we first need to rewrite eq.([mattdisc ] ) to include the full charge distribution , i.e. the nuclear charge as well , since eq.([discp ] ) includes the e - fields arising from all charges .",
    "we define @xmath45 to be the orbital and nuclear charge densities , respectively , and @xmath46 to be the respective electric fields resulting from these charges .",
    "we can then write @xmath47 where the first term is just eq.([mattdisc ] ) , while the second term vanishes since @xmath48 is zero at the center of the orbit , where @xmath49 is concentrated .",
    "since the b - field is negligible in the system at rest , the fields @xmath50 are derived from scalar potentials , @xmath51 , and one has also @xmath52 .",
    "inserting the scalar potentials and integrating by parts several times , one arrives at @xmath53 ( this result is also shown through a slightly more general method in sec.[sec : emfull ] . )    this may now be compared to the em momentum discrepancy , eq.([discp ] ) , with @xmath54 , and one sees that the matter discrepancy cancels the `` interaction '' portion of the em momentum discrepancy , i.e. , the terms containing both @xmath48 and @xmath55.@xcite it does not cancel the `` self - energy '' terms which are quadratic in @xmath48 or @xmath55 alone ; this makes sense because the self - energies are already implicitly included in the particle masses of the classical model .",
    "we note also that it is the interaction energy which is relevant for understanding mass differentials between different configurations of the same charges , e.g. a capacitor with varying plate separation .",
    "eq.([mattdisc3 ] ) and its comparison to the em momentum discrepancy are , intuitively , the main results , but the classical model is too far removed from the true atomic theory to be fully convincing .",
    "in addition to many other well - known deficiencies , one may doubt that the orbiting system would , in fact , attain the same state through physical acceleration which is found by lorentz transformation , because the orbits are largely unconstrained and could change in many ways .",
    "this doubt is considerably reduced in the wave theory of atomic orbitals due to the discreteness of the solutions , since a slow acceleration will not typically cause a jump between different solutions.@xcite for these reasons , we recalculate the momentum discrepancy in the following section using the dirac formalism .",
    "for a dirac particle of charge @xmath29 coupled to an em field @xmath56 , the hamiltonian and momentum operators are ( see appendix and ref . 16 ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 are the standard matrices of dirac ( @xmath59 is unrelated to the boost velocity @xmath60 ) .",
    "we will consider just one dirac field , and work in the single - particle formalism , ignoring the complications of multi - electron states and the additional field for the nucleus ; these do not fundamentally change the calculation",
    ".    given a wavefunction @xmath61 which satisfies the dirac equation , boosting the wavefunction means substituting the coordinate changes , eq.([lorentz ] ) , and applying a spinor rotation given by @xmath62.@xcite working for convenience at time @xmath63 , the only coordinate change is @xmath64 , the effect of which can be computed using the hamiltonian : @xmath65 the change in expected momentum is then given by @xmath66 we choose a gauge where @xmath67 in the rest frame ( again assuming negligible @xmath17 field ) , so the boosted state has @xmath68 ( an additional gauge transformation could accompany the boost , but there is no reason to consider this ) .",
    "the change in @xmath69 implies @xmath70 , and we will also need to use @xmath71 = -i\\vec{\\beta}\\cdot\\vec{\\hat{\\alpha}}$ ] , which cancels the spinor rotation terms .",
    "one finds @xmath72\\hat{p}^i           + \\hat{p}^i\\left[i(\\vec{\\beta}\\cdot\\vec{x})\\hat{h}+ { 1\\over 2}(\\vec{\\beta}\\cdot\\vec{\\hat{\\alpha}})\\right ]              -q\\phi\\beta^i             \\right)\\psi \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\int d^{3}x\\,\\ ,   \\left(-i(\\vec{\\beta}\\cdot\\vec{x})\\psi^\\dagger[\\hat{h},\\hat{p}^i]\\psi                                   + i\\psi^\\dagger[\\hat{p}^i,\\vec{\\beta}\\cdot\\vec{x}]\\hat{h}\\psi                                  -q\\phi\\beta^i\\psi^\\dagger\\psi",

    "the second term is the momentum discrepancy , confirming the result found from the classical model , eq.([mattdisc ] ) .",
    "this calculation , based as it is on a fixed background em field @xmath56 , still does not account for self - energies , which are again implicitly included in the particle masses .",
    "a full calculation would require quantum field theory and renormalization , but otherwise would follow the same manipulations leading to eq.([hdirac2 ] ) , and indeed would lead to the same result , at lowest order .",
    "the formula ( eq.[discp ] ) for the em momentum discrepancy involved only the em field , while the matter momentum discrepancy ( e.g. , eq.[mattdisc ] ) involved both the em field and the charge density . the computation outlined above eq.([mattdisc3 ] ) shows that the two forms are , in fact , opposite to each other , but it is worthwhile to show this using a slightly more general method .",
    "the em energy and momentum derive from the stress - energy tensor ( see appendix ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the em field strength . in the presence of charges , @xmath75 is not conserved but rather satisfies @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total charge current , with @xmath78 .",
    "the em momentum and energy eqs.([hem],[pem ] ) are given by @xmath79 and we wish to calculate the variation of @xmath80 under the small boost eq.([lorentz ] ) .",
    "this is given by the tensor index transformations plus the time change : @xmath81 in the last term we can substitute eq.([emcons ] ) and integrate the resulting spatial derivatives by parts , cancelling the second term and arriving at @xmath82 which , for negligible @xmath17 field , and noting @xmath83 , reduces to @xmath84 showing a discrepancy exactly opposite to the matter momentum discrepancy of eqs.([mattdisc],[hdirac2 ] ) .",
    "the apparent discrepancies in back - reaction calculations involving classical charge distributions are thus accounted for by compensating discrepancies within the materials holding the charges .",
    "this is precisely the mechanism proposed by poincar many years ago ; our purpose has been to describe it more concretely in terms of the underlying matter theories which are now known to hold .",
    "more specifically , the external electric field which is sourced by the classical charges ( e.g. , charges on the capacitor plates ) develops a momentum discrepancy eq.([discp ] ) , which seems puzzling because the classical charges are fixed in place and can not store additional momentum .",
    "however , eq.([mattdisc3 ] ) shows that the full em momentum discrepancy , both external and internal , is cancelled by the corresponding matter discrepancies , when all charges are included .",
    "the classical charges do not contribute to this because ( noting eq.[mattdisc ] ) the total e - field at their locations must vanish in order for the charges to be static .",
    "discrepancies of the `` 4/3 '' variety are seen to be inevitable when boosting a composite relativistic system , because the boost alters the simultaneity surface differently in different directions , changing the way momentum is divided between the subsystems .",
    "another way to understand the discrepancies is to note that the back - reaction from one subsystem onto another arises from a local interaction , which has no way of accounting for the total energy contained in the extended region occupied by the subsystem .",
    "this was not an issue in newtonian physics because interactions in that paradigm are not mediated by local fields , hence do not cause energy and momentum to be dispersed over an extended spatial region to begin with .    a more formal way to see",
    "the orgin of discrepancies is to observe that the interaction lagrangian @xmath85 typically contains no time derivatives ( cf .",
    "appendix ) , hence does not contribute to the momentum density @xmath86 , but the energy @xmath87 does contain @xmath88 .",
    "the boosted momentum must then contain a term @xmath89 , and this can only be produced through discrepancies in the subsystem momenta .",
    "for completeness in understanding sections [ sec : dirac ] and [ sec : emfull ] , we show the derivation of fundamental energy- and momentum - related quantities for the em and dirac fields . the action for an em field coupled to fermions of charge @xmath29",
    "is given by @xmath90 , where@xcite @xmath91 where @xmath74 .",
    "the em field satisfies the equation @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the charge current @xmath94 .",
    "we note that in the mostly - plus metric convention one has @xmath95 , giving @xmath96 , which is the expected form of the charge density .",
    "the matter equation of motion is @xmath97 from which one derives @xmath98 where the single - particle dirac hamiltonian @xmath99 is as in eq.([diracops ] ) , and we note the mostly - plus definitions @xmath100 and @xmath101 , as well as @xmath102 .",
    "the canonical stress - energy ( se ) tensors are given by@xcite @xmath103 and @xmath104 the total energy and momentum of the system are then defined by @xmath105 these overall quantities are gauge invariant since they are derived from a gauge - invariant lagrangian , but the separate em and matter tensors are not gauge invariant , and using @xmath106 one does not obtain the familiar expressions eqs.([hem],[pem ] ) . to avoid",
    "this inconvenience one usually redefines the em tensor to the gauge - invariant form @xmath107 which gives the normal expressions eqs.([hem],[pem ] ) .",
    "this change corresponds to adding an extra term @xmath108 to the canonical em tensor , and the same must then be subtracted from the matter tensor . both se tensors",
    "are then separately gauge invariant .",
    "we note that the overall se tensor is not symmetric , although the em side becomes symmetric after the correction .",
    "the fully symmetrized se tensor is obtained by adding a further total divergence to the matter se tensor , which does not change the integrated energy and momentum.@xcite    hence , to verify that matter momentum discrepancies cancel those generated by the standard em expressions eqs.([hem],[pem ] ) , one must use energy and momentum derived from the matter se tensor @xmath109 which looks strange , but gives a reasonable result because the added term can be integrated by parts and then converted to a @xmath61 term using eq.([emeq ] ) . in this way",
    "one finds energy @xmath110 showing the correctness of the energy used in eq.([hdirac2 ] ) . for the dirac field momentum one finds similarly that the added se term converts derivatives @xmath111 to the gauge - invariant form @xmath112 , justifying the gauged momentum operator given in eq.([diracops ] ) .",
    "we note lastly that the se tensor alteration eq.([extrat ] ) does not affect the momentum discrepancies in the two subsystems , as this term by itself has no discrepancy .",
