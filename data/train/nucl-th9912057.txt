    "the correlated basis function ( cbf ) theory is one of the most promising many  body tools currently under development to attack the problem of dealing with the complicate structure ( short range repulsion and strong state dependence ) of the nuclear interaction .",

    "it is essential , however , that the two  body correlation @xmath11 has an operatorial dependence analogous to that of the modern nucleon  nucleon interactions @xcite . nowadays , sophisticated cbf calculations consider @xmath11 of the form : @xmath13 where the involved operators are : @xmath14\\otimes \\left [ 1 , { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}}_i \\cdot { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}}_j \\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath15 is the tensor operator .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath16 , as well as the set of single particle wave functions , are fixed by the energy minimization procedure .",
    "a key point in applying cbf is the evaluation of the many ",
    "variables integrals necessary to calculate the energy functional ( [ enfun ] ) .",
    "a direct approach consists in using monte carlo sampling techniques ( variational montecarlo , vmc ) @xcite .",
    "however , the required numerical effort is such that , for realistic interactions and correlations , vmc can be efficiently used only in light nuclei .",
    "actually , a realistic calculation of the ground state of @xmath0o has been done in ref.@xcite by using the so called cluster montecarlo ( cmc ) method . in cmc",
    "the terms related to the scalar part of the correlation ( @xmath17 ) are completely summed by vmc , whereas the remaining operatorial ( @xmath18 ) contributions are approximated by considering up to four or five  body cluster terms .",
    "an alternative to the montecarlo methodology is provided by cluster expansions and the integral summation technique known as fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) @xcite , particularly suited to treat heavy systems . by means of the fhnc equations it is possible to sum infinite classes of mayer - like diagrams resulting from the cluster expansion of the expectation value of the hamiltonian , or of any other operator .",
    "fhnc has been widely applied to both finite and infinite systems with purely scalar ( state independent , or jastrow ) correlations .",
    "the case of the state dependent @xmath11 , needed in nuclear systems , is more troublesome since the non commutativity of the correlation operators prevents from the development of a complete fhnc theory for the correlated wave function of eq.([psi ] ) .",
    "for this reason an approximated treatment of the operatorial correlations , called single operator chain ( soc ) , has been developed @xcite .",
    "the soc approximation , together with a full fhnc treatment of the jastrow part of the correlation , provides an accurate description of infinite nucleonic matter @xcite .",
    "it is therefore believed that fhnc / soc effectively includes the contribution of many  body correlated clusters at all orders .",
    "the evaluation of additional classes of diagrams in nuclear matter has set the estimated accuracy for the ground state energy to less than @xmath19 mev at saturation density ( @xmath200.16 @xmath21 ) @xcite .    in a series of papers @xcite",
    "we have extended the fhnc scheme to describe the ground state of doubly closed shell nuclei , from @xmath22he to @xmath23pb , with semi - realistic , central interactions and two - body correlations , either of the jastrow type or depending , at most , on the third components of the isospins of the correlated nucleons . in ref.@xcite",
    "we used fhnc / soc to evaluate energies and densities of the @xmath0o and @xmath1ca nuclei , having doubly closed shells in the _ ls _ coupling scheme , with potentials and correlations containing operator terms up to the tensor components . in the @xmath0o nucleus",
    "the comparison of our results with those of a cmc calculation confirmed the accuracy of the fhnc / soc approximation estimated in nuclear matter .",

    "the ground state properties of the @xmath0o and @xmath1ca nuclei are calculated within the fhnc / soc formalism by using a complete , realistic nucleon  nucleon potential , with @xmath24 components , and by considering also three  nucleon interactions .",

    "they are the non energy weighted sums of the inclusive dynamical responses of the nucleus to external probes .",
    "we have studied the density , the electromagnetic and the spin static responses , both in the longitudinal and transverse channels .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly present the interaction and the correlated wave function properties and recall the basic features of fhnc / soc ; section 3 deals in short with the insertion of the spin  orbit components and of the three ",

    "the elementary functions , @xmath117 , represent an input to the fhnc equations , as they can not be calculated in a closed form .",
    "the fhnc/0 approximation consists in neglecting all the elementary contributions .",
    "this seemingly crude approximation is actually based on the fact that the elementary diagrams are highly connected and have , at least , a quadratic dependence on the density of the system .",
    "these diagrams are not expected to produce relevant contributions in the relatively low density nuclear systems , whereas they are important in denser systems , like atomic liquid helium .",
    "a test of the validity of the fhnc/0 approximation , and , in general , of the importance of the elementary diagrams , is provided by the degree of accuracy in satisfying the densities normalizations . in ref .",
    "@xcite particular attention has been paid to the normalization of the one - body density , @xmath118 and to that of the central and isospin two - body densities , @xmath119 @xmath120    deviations of the sum rules from their exact values are due to ( _ i _ ) the approximate evaluation of the elementary diagrams and ( _ ii _ ) the soc approximation .",
    "the first item has been already investigated in ref.@xcite , where it has been found that the most relevant corrections to the fhnc/0 sum rules come from the @xmath121 diagrams , _",

    "these diagrams mainly contribute to the isospin saturation sum rule ( [ srtau ] ) and to the potential energy , if the interaction has large exchange terms .",

    "this difference is compatible with the nuclear matter estimates .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the novelty of this work with respect to ref.@xcite is the inclusion of the spin  orbit and three  body terms of the potential . in this section",
    "we briefly show how to extend the fhnc / soc formalism to consider these parts of the interaction .",
    "the treatment of the spin - orbit interaction within the fhnc / soc formalism has been discussed in details in ref.@xcite for the nuclear matter case . in that paper ,",
    "the evaluation of the mean value of the spin - orbit terms of the interaction , @xmath126 , was done using a @xmath127 correlation factor , so including all the 8 operatorial components in eq.([corr8 ] ) .",
    "here we extend the nuclear matter formalism to the finite nuclei case for a @xmath70 correlation . a correlation containing spin ",
    "orbit components would , probably , be more efficient from the variational point of view",
    ". however , these correlation terms introduce extra uncertainties in the cluster expansion , and we have chosen to work with a simpler correlation in favor of a safer convergence .",

    "the table also contains the kinetic energies computed with only the mean field wave functions .",

    "the comparison between the ws calculations done with the two different interactions shows small differences in the results , of the order of 7% in @xmath184 . from the relative point of view",
    "the largest differences are those related to @xmath189 , which for a14 are 50% smaller than those of a8. these rather similar values of the energies have been obtained with two quite different sets of single particle wave functions .",

    "this may indicate that charge distributions and rms radii are sensitive to details of the many body wave function which have small effects on the energy calculation .",
    "to better study this aspect , we have done calculations by using a set of single particle wave functions fixed to reproduce at best the empirical charge densities . in this case , the only variational parameters are those related to the correlation functions .",

    "the analysis of these results shows that the values of the kinetic and potential energies have considerably changed , while their sum remains almost constant .",
