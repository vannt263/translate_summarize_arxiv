    "the levenshtein ( or edit ) metric @xcite is a standard tool to estimate the distance between two sequences .",
    "it is widely used in linguistics and bioinformatics , and for the recognition of text blocks with isolated mistakes . as is well known , its computational complexity , when applied to two sequences of ( approximately ) the same length @xmath3 , is @xmath4 . since this is a hurdle in many practical applications , it is desirable to replace , or to approximate , the levenshtein ( l ) distance by some quantity of smaller ( preferably linear ) computational complexity .",
    "two fast approximation algorithms for edit distances were suggested by @xcite , one based on maximal exact matches , the other on suitably restricted subword comparisons between the two sequences ; compare also @xcite .",
    "this would indeed give @xmath5 , due to their computability from the suffix tree ; see @xcite .",
    "however , they only provide lower bounds , and hence no complete solution of the problem .",
    "it seems possible to estimate probabilistically , with sublinear complexity , whether the l - distance of two sequences is ` small ' or ` large ' ; see @xcite .",
    "whether an improvement of this rather coarse result or even a replacement of the l - distance is possible , with at most linear complexity and a non - probabilistic outcome , seems open .",
    "below , we compare the l - distance with a representative dictionary - based distance .",
    "our findings support the conclusion that such a simplification might be difficult or even impossible . on the way , we highlight some interesting properties that have been neglected so far , but seem relevant for a better understanding of such distance concepts .",
    "to keep discussion and results transparent , we concentrate on two specific distances , and on binary sequences .",
    "we have also tried a number of obvious alternatives , but they did not show any significantly different behaviour . in this sense ,",
    "the structure of our example is more likely typical than exceptional .",
    "the l - distance @xmath6 of two sequences @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( not necessarily of equal length ) is the minimum number of edit operations ( insertions , deletions , or substitutions ) needed to transform @xmath7 into @xmath8 or vice versa ( * ? ? ?",
    "though @xmath6 is closely related to the longest common subsequence ( lcs ) ( loc.cit .",
    "11.6.2 ) of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( and hence to distances based upon it ) , one important difference lies in the possibility of substitutions .",
    "so , using the lcs in this context requires some care . for sequences of lengths @xmath9 and @xmath3 , the computational complexity of calculating @xmath10 ( or the lcs ) is @xmath11 , e.g. , when based on the needleman - wunsch algorithm ; see ( * ? ? ? * ch .",
    "6.4.2 ) .",
    "a generic choice for a dictionary - based metric is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the full dictionary of @xmath7 , i.e. , the set of all non - empty subwords of @xmath7 , and @xmath14 is the symmetric difference of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this choice actually disregards the goal of computational simplification , but focuses on the full dictionary information instead , and thus , in some sense , represents the optimal information on the sequences to be compared .",
    "it is well known that , using the suffix tree structure , the calculation of closely related dictionary - based distances is possible with linear complexity , e.g. , by means of ukkonen s algorithm ; compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  6 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "further restrictions are likely to reduce the usefulness in relation to the l - distance .",
    "both @xmath10 and @xmath17 define a _",
    "i.e. , for arbitrary sequences @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the distance @xmath20 satisfies the axioms of a metric ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  2.11 )",
    ":    * @xmath21 ( positivity ) ; * @xmath22 if and only if @xmath23 ( non - degeneracy ) ; * @xmath24 ( symmetry ) ; * @xmath25 ( triangle inequality ) .",
    "less clear is the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath17 .",
    "since one can easily construct pairs of sequences that are close in one , but not in the other distance , they are certainly not equivalent in the strong sense as also used for norms , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "they are equivalent in the weaker sense of generating the same topology ( * ? ? ?",
    "22.5 ) , which is the discrete topology here . however , this is of little use for the question addressed above .",
    "the situation does not improve if one replaces @xmath26 by the quotient @xmath27 , which is another metric , with range in @xmath28 $ ] . as we shall see below",
    ", the situation is actually much worse .",
    "of the l - distance @xmath10 between two random sequences of length @xmath29 ( dots ) and gaussian approximation ( line ) , with mean @xmath30 and variance @xmath31.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    to get a first impression of the l - distance , we computed the discrete probability distribution of the values @xmath6 for sequences @xmath32 of the same length , under uniform distribution on sequence space .",
    "this has long been known to be a reasonable first approach for the comparison of sequences from data bases @xcite . up to length 20 , this was done using all possible pairs ; for longer sequences , the distribution was estimated from a sufficiently large random selection of pairs . for length @xmath33 ,",
    "the result obtained from @xmath34 pairs is shown in figure  [ gauss ] . for large @xmath3",
    ", the distributions seem to be well described by gaussian ( or normal ) distributions .",
    "this qualitative behaviour does not change much and seems to improve with sequence length .",
    "one could add weight to this finding by performing a statistical test on gaussianity , which would score well .",
    "however , we think that one should not over - interpret this observation , in particular in view of a recent numerical investigation by @xcite which indicates that a gamma distribution might give an even better description .",
    "note that , if extrema over _ local _ alignments are taken , one obtains an extremal value distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "however , this implies nothing for the _ global _ alignment considered here .",
    "the possible ( or approximate ) gaussian nature of this case has been observed before by dayhoff , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) and references given there ; a more detailed investigation of tail probabilities can be found in @xcite .",
    "still , it seems to be hardly noted , although it is a relevant phenomenon that deserved further attention , with exact results presently not in sight .     of the probability distribution @xmath35 as a function of sequence length @xmath3 , calculated exactly for @xmath36 and by simulation otherwise .",
    "the solid line shows the least squares fit @xmath37.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]     of the probability distribution @xmath35 as a function of sequence length @xmath3 , calculated exactly for @xmath36 and by simulation otherwise . the solid line shows the least squares fit @xmath38.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    for this reason",
    ", we could only investigate our findings numerically .",
    "beyond checking the gaussian behaviour qualitatively , means and variances were calculated for different @xmath3 , both by exact enumeration ( for @xmath36 ) and by simulation ( for larger @xmath3 , up to @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the mean and the variance , as functions of sequence length , show power - law behaviour , at least asymptotically . our data ,",
    "see figures [ meanplot ] and [ varplot ] , are compatible with an asymptotically linear growth of the mean and an asymptotic @xmath40 power law for the variance , both with a square - root correction term ( for which we do not have any particular justification ) .",
    "such predictions and conjectures are presently discussed by various people @xcite . in particular , the @xmath40 power law for the variance would be in line with analogous observations for the lcs , compare @xcite .",
    "since there has recently been some doubt in the correctness of this finding @xcite , it requires further corroboration and investigation .",
    "a similar finding ( though with larger fluctuations ) applies to the distribution of the values @xmath41 for random pairs @xmath32 . however , there is no compelling reason to investigate this specific distance in detail , as it was mainly selected for illustrative purposes and does not seem to be closely related to one of the standard problems of probability theory .",
    "more interesting , and also more relevant , is the question for the _ joint _ distribution of @xmath41 and @xmath6 .",
    "a necessary requirement for a useful relation between the two distances would be a strong correlation .",
    "however , as figure  [ corr ] shows for sequences of length @xmath42 , there is little correlation at all  the joint distribution is rather well described by the product of the two gaussians needed for the marginal distributions .",
    "this observation could be quantified with some effort , but we refrain from doing so because it would not contribute to the interpretation at this stage .",
    "our finding means that , at least on the level of the full sequence space or for the alignment of two random sequences ( as analyzed in our simulations ) , the distances @xmath41 and @xmath6 are closer to being statistically independent of each other than to being useful approximations of one another .     for @xmath17 and @xmath10 , obtained from a simulation with @xmath43 random pairs of sequences of length @xmath42 .",
    "both marginal distributions are approximately gaussian , with slightly larger fluctuations for the distribution of @xmath17-values.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "our findings are to be interpreted with care . they do not rule out a simplified approach to l - type distances , at least when restricted to ( possibly relevant ) subsets of sequences .",
    "however , they seem to indicate that subword comparison leads to statistically independent information , at least when viewed on the full sequence space . clearly , different distance concepts can and should be tried .",
    "moreover , a rigorous stochastic analysis of the various limit distributions is necessary to clarify the picture obtained from the simulations .    as long as analytic results ( e.g. , via limit theorems ) are unavailable , it would also help to perform a more detailed statistical analysis of the various distributions , including clear - cut statistical tests .",
    "in particular , it would be extremely relevant to also consider suitable subspaces of the full sequence space , such as those extractable from existing data bases . though this is clearly far beyond the scope of this short note , we believe that it would be a rewarding task for future investigations .",
