    "<S> a number of curiosities can be seen . </S>",
    "<S> first , in spite of the data smoothing , there are visible peaks at just under 3 hours and 4 hours for all three marathons . for the chicago marathon in particular , where the course is flat and well - suited for pacing </S>",
    "<S> , one can even discern secondary peaks near 3:10 , 3:20 , and 3:30 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ finish ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of such peaks suggests that the distribution of finish times in this range does not reflect a performance limit , but rather , the surmounting of a psychological barrier . </S>",
    "<S> parenthetically , the apparent difference in the distributions for the boston marathon ( where challenging qualifying times exist ) , with the chicago and new york marathons can be made to nearly disappear by plotting them in scaled units  </S>",
    "<S> namely , by making the abscissa the finish time divided by the average finish time for each set of 8 races .     between the @xmath3 and @xmath6 finisher for : the us ( @xmath7 ) and the european ( @xmath8 ) marathons cited in the text . </S>",
    "<S> for the us marathons the first 10,000 gaps are shown , while the first 100 gaps are shown for the european marathons . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line has a slope of @xmath9 , as given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> .,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    more interesting behavior , and the main point of this work , is the @xmath5 dependence of the time gaps @xmath10 between successive finishers . </S>",
    "<S> we are particularly interested in these gaps for finishers near the front of the pack . </S>",
    "<S> thus we restrict ourselves to the first 10,000 finishers in the us marathons . </S>",
    "<S> this threshold corresponds to finishing times of about 4 hours for chicago and new york , and around 3:45 for boston . by comparing with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ finish ] , these time thresholds are prior to the peak of the finishing time distribution for chicago and new york , and near the peak for boston . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the average number of finishers over the last eight us marathons that we studied is 30,668 for chicago , 33,669 for new york , and 16,645 for boston . for @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath12 begins increasing , corresponding to the lagging tail of the finishing time distribution . </S>",
    "<S> for the european data , we quote @xmath13 only to @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> .    among the fastest finishers , the finish time distribution decays very slowly and is nearly constant for times less than 2:30 ( inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ finish ] ) . for the marathons that we studied , </S>",
    "<S> the _ average _ time gap between consecutive finishers among the first 10 places is in the range of 2060 seconds , and do not have any clear systematic @xmath5 dependence ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dt - av ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> members of this group of elite runners are all possible candidates to win the race on any given day . in contrast , beyond the @xmath0 place , the average gap systematically decreases with @xmath5 , a decrease that clearly reflects the increase in the density of runners as the leading edge of the pack arrives at the finish .    </S>",
    "<S> we can make these observations quantitative by assuming that the finishing times of individual runners are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables , and then using extreme - value statistics to determine the time gaps @xmath10 between successive finishers @xcite . as a preliminary , </S>",
    "<S> consider the time @xmath2 of the @xmath3 finisher . </S>",

    "<S> the typical @xmath3 finishing time @xmath2 should be accurate for @xmath16 , where fluctuations in @xmath2 are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , we can compute the full probability distribution of @xmath2 , as outlined in appendix  [ pdf t_k ] and thereby find the mean value of @xmath2 to be @xmath17 where @xmath18\\big/\\bigl[\\int_0 ^ 1 x^{a-1}\\,(1-x)^{b-1}\\ , \\rmd x\\bigr]$ ] is the regularized ( in the sense that @xmath19 ) incomplete beta function and @xmath20 is the exceedance probability .    the main message from either the exact result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ i_y ] ) or the extremal condition in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ext ] ) , is that the time gap @xmath21 , has the following generic behaviors ( see appendix  [ appendix ] for three simple examples ) :    * if @xmath22 is constant , then @xmath12 is independent of @xmath5 . * </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath22 increases monotonically as @xmath23 increases , then @xmath24 decreases monotonically as @xmath5 increases . * </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath22 decreases monotonically as @xmath23 increases , then @xmath24 increases monotonically as @xmath5 increases .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now apply the above results to marathon finishing times . as a trivial and artificial initial example , suppose that the marathon runners speeds @xmath25 are distributed exponentially , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 a characteristic running speed . </S>",
    "<S> then the distribution of finishing times @xmath28 would be @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a typical finishing time for the field , and @xmath31 is the course length . </S>",
    "<S> applying the extremal criterion to this distribution gives the typical @xmath3 finishing time @xmath32 $ ] . while @xmath2 increases with @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , as it must , this result has the unrealistic feature that the winning time approaches zero as the field becomes arbitrarily large .    </S>",

    "<S> , the data clearly show that there is an `` excess '' of elite runners ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dt - av ] ) , as the time gaps between successive finishers are roughly constant for the first 20 places . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for the us races , the gaps between the first few consecutive finishers actually decrease with @xmath5 . as seen in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ finish ] , then a constant gap would be reproduced . the generic behavior of the dependence of the gap @xmath10 on @xmath5 is discussed in appendix  [ appendix ] . along these lines , a recent theory @xcite predicts a crowding of runners near the front of marathon packs when the finishing time distribution is bounded from below . </S>",
    "<S> one additional feature of the gaps is that they begin to increase with @xmath47 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dt - av ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior also arises from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dtk ] ) for large @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this regime corresponds to finishing times of more than @xmath48 hours and is not relevant for our main conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> is there an explanation for having an excess of world - class runners ? </S>",
    "<S> many elite runners enjoy considerable incentives to maintain their competitive edge , including appearance money , access to the best support institutions ( medical and athletic ) , etc . </S>",
    "<S> thus if one achieves a time that qualifies as an elite performance , one is then in a position to take advantage of the various inducements offered to leading runners to maintain such a status . </S>",
    "<S> however , runners at the next tier of achievement face a daunting challenge . to run a marathon in the range , </S>",
    "<S> say , of 2:152:30 ( for men ) is still an impressive achievement that requires significant talent , dedication , and time commitment . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a finish time is too slow to be competitive at major marathons . </S>",
    "<S> thus runners who finish in this range typically have little or no external support for their athletic activities and have to balance this all - consuming endeavor with the need to survive economically . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , one may even anticipate a deficit of male runners who can complete a marathon in the range of 2:152:30 . </S>",
    "<S> such a feature does actually occur in the boston marathon </S>",
    "<S> .    it would be valuable to study whether a similar excess of elite exists in different athletic events or other forms of human competition . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth mentioning that perhaps a similar elite excess occurs in human mortality , where there is a well - known mortality plateau among the longest - lived individuals @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> again , there seems to be a self - selected sub - population of advantaged individuals who gain advantage both innately and perhaps because of external reinforcement .    </S>",
