    "since its discovery in 1992 , simultaneously with the sigma instrument on the _ granat _ satellite and the batse instrument on the _ cgro _ satellite ( castro - tirado , brandt , lund , 1992 ; harmon , paciesas , fishman , 1992 ) , grs 1915 + 105 has been one of the most extensively studied sources of recent times .",
    "the popularity of this source is due to its highly complex and variable nature at all wavelengths from gamma rays to radio .",
    "the many unusual features include relativistic jets ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ; fender et al .",
    "1999 ) , x - ray quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) ( morgan & remillard 1996 ) and accretion instabilities resulting in jet formation ( pooley & fender 1997 ; eikenberry et al . 1998 ; mirabel et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the system exhibits a wide variety of radio behaviour on timescales from minutes to weeks ( foster et al . 1996 ; pooley & fender 1997 ) .",
    "high time resolution observations using the ryle telescope ( rt ) and more continuous coverage on hourly time - scales , revealed new aspects of the radio emission ( pooley & fender 1997 hereafter pf97 ) .",
    "both 2040 min period qpos associated with soft x - ray variations ( first reported in the radio by pooley ( 1995,1996 ) ) and a change of qpo period , were clearly visible during some individual observations .",

    ", the authors showed that the radio variations were delayed by 33 ( or perhaps 59 ) minutes relative to the infrared .",
    "is there a correlation between the radio or infrared emission and the x - rays ?",
    "there is clearly some correlation between x - ray states and radio emission ( _ cgro _ burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) correlation reported by foster et al .",
    "1996 , _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ proportional counter array ( _ rxte _ pca ) correlation reported by pf97 ) , and pf97 were also the first to observe frequency - dependent delays in the radio emission .",

    "the source of these flares is consistent with infrared emitting plasmons from _ ejected disc material _ , following rapid x - ray variability and an x - ray dip .",
    "the confirmation of such a hypothesis was presented by mirabel et al.(1998 ) with simultaneous _",
    "pca , united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) and very large array ( vla ) data .",
    "several x - ray dips and subsequent infrared and radio flares were observed .",
    "we obtained sub - mm data over two days on mjd 51026 and 51027 , when grs 1915 + 105 was moderately active , with periods of quiescence interspersed .",
    "co - ordinated with this were quasi - simultaneous observations at radio wavelengths .",
    "the radio data were taken using the green bank interferometer ( gbi ) at 2.25 and 8.3 ghz , and the rt at 15 ghz .",
    "sub - mm data at 350 ghz was taken using the james clark maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) using the scuba array , and x - ray data were obtained at 212 kev from the _ rxte _ asm instrument .",

    "the rt is an 8-element east  west array operating at 15-ghz ; details of the operation can be found in pf97 .",

    "[ rt_gbi_decay ] shows the photometry from the gbi at 8 ghz and the rt at 15 ghz for 7 d around the time of our scuba observations .",
    "the flux is in general decaying , with some fluctuations around days 51023 and 51025 . the decay becomes steadier around the time of the sub - mm observations on days 51026 and 51027 .",
    "we have modelled the decay of the last three days shown in fig.[rt_gbi_decay ] at all three radio wavelengths with a linear fit .",
    "this provides a plausible estimate to the cm - wave fluxes when interpolated to the times when the sub - mm data were taken , providing there were no rare sharp outbursts .",
    "averaged projected fluxes using this method are given in table [ weighted_average ] .",
    "the main difficulty in interpretation of these data is the validity of extrapolating a variable source using a simple constant decay .",
    "if data at all radio frequencies follows the simple decay law , and no additional flares were produced at the time of the scuba observations , then the spectra over the two epochs in fig .",
    "[ proj_spectra ] shows a clear sub - mm excess . while these last two assumptions may be over simplifying the reality of grs 1915 + 105 ( e.g.  fig .",
    "4 in pf97 shows a large short - lived flare ) , previous observations have shown a high - frequency excess at infrared compared with radio observations ( fender & pooley 1998 ; mirabel et al .  1998 ) .",
    "photometric observations by these authors have shown that over a large range in radio flux ( 10100 mjy ) , and with multiple oscillations , the radio spectrum at a time when the flux is low ( @xmath8 mjy ) is very similar to that in this paper ( e.g.  fig .  1 in mirabel et al .",
    "1998 ) , and during times when the radio flux at 8 ghz is around 15 mjy , the 2.2 @xmath0 m flux is 35 - 40 mjy .",
    "the flat spectrum ( @xmath9 high - frequency excess ) presented here is seen in other x - ray binaries where there exists significant emission at the mm and sub - mm regimes . both cyg x-1 ( fender et al .",
    "2000 ) and cyg x-3 ( fender et al .  1995 ; ogley et al .",
    "1998 ) have spectra with indices @xmath10 , deviating from the expected optically thin , @xmath11 , steep spectrum observed during an outburst ( where spectral index @xmath12 as @xmath13 ) .    as discussed by other authors , a sub - mm excess and approximately flat synchrotron spectrum are likely to originate in a partially self - absorbed jet ( blandford & knigl 1979 ; hjellming & johnston 1988 ; fender et al .",
    "in such a scenario higher frequencies probe smaller emitting regions close to the base of the outflow .",
    "indeed , for an ideal blandford & konigl conical jet characteristic size @xmath14 , and so the regions responsible for the emission observed at 350 ghz may be only 5% as far downstream as those observed at 15 ghz .",
    "dhawan , mirabel & rodrguez ( 1998 ) present a vlbi image of the core of the system in which the 15 ghz emission arises on an angular scale of a few milliarcsec . at 350 ghz",
    ", the emission may therefore be coming from angular scales as small as 200 microarcsec  at 11 kpc ( fender et al . 1999 ) this corresponds to a physical scale of about an astronomical unit . for a velocity of @xmath15 ( mirabel & rodrguez 1984 ; fender et al .",
    "1999 ) this distance would be traversed within a few tens of seconds .",
    "pooley & fender ( 1997 ) , mirabel et al . ( 1998 ) and fender & pooley ( 1998 ) report frequency - dependent delays in the synchrotron emission , in the sense that higher frequecies rise and peak earlier .",
    "mirabel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) fit the delays to the form @xmath16 , although in the self - similar regime of an ideal blandford and konigl jet this should be @xmath17 .",
    "either way ,",
    "the for an observed delay of tens of minutes at 15 ghz , we would also expect from this scaling that the sub - mm emission arises less than a minute downstream in the flow from the base of the jet .",
    "so scaling with respect to both direct imaging and frequency - dependent delays show that sub - mm observations are ideal for studying emission near the base of the jet ( and do not suffer the instellar extinction which can be so dramatic for @xmath18 m ) .",
    "3 shows the radio(sub)mm spectrum observed from grs 1915 + 105 on the two consecutive days of observation .",
    "the similar fractional decrease in all bands strongly supports our interpretation of the sub - mm emission as being a high - frequency extension of the synchrotron spectrum observed at cm wavelengths . as noted above",
    ", the flow time of electrons from the disc / black hole to the sub - mm - emitting region is likely to be much shorter than the interval between the observations , and so we are likely to be observing two different populations of electrons on the two days of observations .",
    "the similarity of the spectra is therefore an indication of the steadiness of the disc : jet coupling and of the outflow itself .",
    "the decrease in mean flux density between the two days may reflect a small decrease in accretion rate .",
    "if there had _ not _ been a renewal of the electron population over the 24 hr between the observation , this would require the magnetic field at the site of the 350 ghz emission to be @xmath19 g in order that synchrotron losses had not become significant .",
    "we do not have a good explanation at present for the apparent minimum in the spectrum between 15  350 ghz , but given the non - simultaneity of the data and notoriously unpredictable nature of the source , we will not discuss it further here .",
    "in addition we note that radio ",
    "mm observations of grs 1915 + 105 presented in fender & pooley ( 2000 ) constitute evidence that the radio  infrared spectrum can steepen from @xmath20 to more positive values .",
    "we have obtained the first sub - mm photometry of grs 1915 + 105 at 350 ghz ( 850-@xmath0 m ) , together with radio data on two separate epochs during a time when the source was mildly active . at all frequencies a significant amount of variability was observed , with a roughly flat spectral index , supporting the hypothesis that emission from radio to infrared wavelengths is dominated by synchrotron emission . scaling with respect to both direct vlbi imaging and radio  mm  infrared time delays indicate that future sub - mm observations have the potential to probe very close to the base of the jet .",
    "the authors are very grateful for the ` wizardry ' of scheduling by graeme watt at the jcmt , and for assistance by richard prestage , rob j.  ivison , wayne holland and tim jenness in co - ordinating and reducing the data .",
