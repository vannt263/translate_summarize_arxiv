    "the accurate determination of element abundance in planetary nebulae ( pne ) and regions is important for understanding the matter cycle between stars and the ism .",
    "this crucially depends on the assumed free electron energy distributions ( eeds ) in that the emissivities of recombination lines ( rls ) and collisionally excited lines ( cels ) are given by the integral of the known energy dependence of the relevant atomic cross section over the eeds . in the past",
    ", the generally accepted assumption is that free electrons in photoionized nebulae are in thermal equilibrium , in which the eeds follow a maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) distribution , characterized by a single parameter , the electron temperature .",
    "however , this assumption has never been validated by direct observations , but is largely based on the theoretical argument that the electron thermalization time - scale via elastic collisions is much shorter than the other known processes that produce non - thermal electrons under typical nebular conditions . although there were some early debates about the mb distributions in pne ( see introduction of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has not been seriously doubted until recently .    it has been long known that there exist non - mb distributed particles in solar and space plasmas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0 distributions , consisting of a low - energy mb core and a high - energy power law tail , are introduced to characterize those non - mb distributions , with smaller @xmath0 indices indicating larger deviations from mb distributions . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that the @xmath0 distributions can arise naturally from tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics . in non - isolated systems",
    ", on - going accelerations , such as those induced by magnetic reconnections , shocks , and turbulence , can generate non - thermal electrons , which are predicted to have @xmath0 eeds according to the non - equilibrium generalization of the mb distributions .",
    "this raises a critical question of whether the @xmath0 distributions also widely exist in other astronomical environments other than the solar system plasmas , such as photoionized gaseous nebulae , and the mb distributions are only a special case of equilibrium .    inspired by the studies of solar system plasmas",
    ", @xcite proposed that the @xmath0 distributions provide a potential solution for the long - standing problem in nebular physics , viz . , the discrepancies of electron temperatures and heavy - element abundances derived from rls and cels .",
    "the rl / cel discrepancy is commonly quantified by the ratio of o@xmath1 abundances obtained from rls and cels , called abundance discrepancy factor ( adf ; * ? ? ? * ) . the adfs range from 1 to 71 , with the most extreme case found in the pn hf2 - 2 @xcite .",
    "as the high - energy tail of @xmath0 eeds preferably contribute to the emission of cels relative to rls , cel diagnostics will result in an overestimated electron temperature , leading to underestimated element abundances , when ones use mb distributions to interpret the spectra actually produced by @xmath0 distributions .",
    "later on , @xmath0 distributions were invoked to explain the abundance discrepancies in regions derived from strong - line and @xmath2-based methods @xcite , and the abnormal line ratios in type 2 quasars @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 indices represent an additional free parameter to match model to observations . in order to examine the validation of this solution ,",
    "it is important to develop methods to diagnose the eeds in photoionized gaseous nebulae .    the first attempt to discriminate eeds in pne",
    "was made by @xcite , who investigated the intensities of dielectronic recombination lines under @xmath0 and mb distributions and compared the theoretical predictions with the spectra of a few pne .",
    "however , taking into account the uncertainties , it is hard to distinguish the two scenarios from the limited observations .",
    "therefore , they can not draw any definite conclusion .",
    "another approach to sample the eeds in pne is to simulate the free - bound ( fb ) emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter zlz ) , i.e. the nebular optical continua . using that method",
    ", zlz found that the observed fb spectra of four pne with extremely large adfs can not be interpreted in terms of a single mb eed , but are equally well fitted by either a two - component mb model or by @xmath0-distributed electrons .",
    "however , shortly thereafter , a similar study independently undertook by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ss ) shows that the two - component mb model actually better accounts for the fb spectrum of hf2 - 2 than @xmath0-distributed electrons , in contrast to zlz s conclusion .",
    "@xcite attributed the discrepancy to the different treatments of h11 emission coefficient , @xmath3(h11 ) . in both models of zlz and ss ,",
    "the continuum intensity has been normalized to the integrated intensity of the h11 balmer line at 3770 .",
    "following @xcite , zlz used an approximate function to obtain @xmath3(h11 ) for a @xmath0 distribution .",
    "the approximation is generally sufficiently accurate , but at high temperatures and/or extremely low @xmath0 indices a correction factor should be considered ( see table  1 of ss ) . at the typical nebular temperature of @xmath4k , the correction increases rapidly from 2 to 30 percent as the @xmath0 index decreases from 10 to 2 .",
    "however , we do not think that this is the main reason causing the inconsistent results between zlz and ss . in the first place",
    ", it seems unlikely ( although not impossible ) that the spectrum fitting based on @xmath0 distribution can be greatly improved by using a more inaccurate @xmath3(h11 ) .",
    "moreover , the model fitting largely relies on the slope of fb continuum , and the approximate treatment of h11 only results in an uncertain scaling constant and thus only has minor effect on the result .",
    "we note that the primary difference between the modelling approaches of zlz and ss is in the treatment of subtraction of the underlying stellar light contaimination .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of contaminating stellar continuum has been assumed to follow a power - law , @xmath5 .",
    "ss obtained @xmath6 by fitting the model continuum to the observed one in two wavelength segments longer than the balmer edge ( 37803790 and 41804230 ) .",
    "for this purpose , they need to presuppose a fb continuum for a given temperature and @xmath0 value .",
    "in contrast , zlz considered the whole line - free spectral range 35504200 , and optimized the model fitting by adjusting the @xmath7 value",
    ". the latter may provide a more flexible way to fit the global spectral behavior .",
    "it seems to us this different treatment of the underlying stellar light contamination might actually be the primary cause for the different conclusions drawn by ss and zlz .",
    "we should point out that accurate subtraction of background contribution and reliable continuum flux calibration are the main challenge of using fb continuum to probe the eeds .",
    "although no solid observational evidence is found to support the idea of deviation from mb eeds in nebulae , if the @xmath0 distributions were proven valid , one would need a new paradigm for the study of nebular astrophysics . in this paper , we present determinations of the @xmath0 indices for a sample of pne and regions under the assumption that the @xmath0 eeds are fully responsible for the rl / cel discrepancy problem .",
    "the reported @xmath0 values could serve as a basis for future studies of this problem .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the methodology to derive the @xmath0 indices from nebular spectra .",
    "the results are reported in section  3 . in section  4",
    "we explore the correlations of the resultant @xmath0 values and other nebular properties , in order to investigate the potential causes of @xmath0 eeds .",
    "a summary is given in section  5 .",
    "as quoted , the calculations of rl and cel intensities largely depend on eeds .",
    "the eed is quantified by @xmath8 , the fraction of electrons having an energy of @xmath9 . in an equilibrium state , @xmath8 is given by the mb function @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath2 is the electron temperature .",
    "when the plasma is in a non - equilibrium stationary state , the eed follows a @xmath0 distribution defined by @xmath12^{-\\kappa-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the gamma function , @xmath0 is a parameter @xmath14 describing the degree of departure from the mb distribution , and @xmath15 is the non - equilibrium temperature characterizing the mean kinetic energy .",
    "lower @xmath0 values represent larger departures from the mb distribution .",
    "as the @xmath0 index approaches infinity , the @xmath0 distribution decays to the mb distribution , where we have @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "compared to the mb distribution , the @xmath0 distribution has a high - energy tail that is power - law distributed . for a given @xmath15 value , the fraction of high - energy electrons increases with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "the low - energy parts of a @xmath0 distribution can be approximated by a mb distribution of a temperature @xmath18 . since @xmath19 , this mb function should be scaled by a factor of @xmath20 to match the core of the @xmath0 distribution , where @xmath21 can be obtained by requiring @xmath22 . from equations  ( [ mb1 ] ) and ( [ k1 ] ) , we have @xmath23 the @xmath24 value represents the fraction of non - thermal electrons , which ranges from 0.01 to 0.45 when the @xmath0 index decreases from 100 to 2 .    it is conceivable that incorrect results will be obtained if ones utilize the mb - based method to determine the electron density ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath2 of the plasma with the @xmath0 eed eeds . ] .",
    "if the @xmath25-diagnostic lines are dominantly excited by low - energy electrons ( e.g. rls and infrared fine - structure cels ) , the mb - based method will result in a @xmath25 value that is overestimated by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "the balmer jump ( bj ) of recombination spectrum and the [ ] nebular and auroral lines are the most used @xmath2-diagnostics in nebulae .",
    "the former is mostly contributed by low - energy electrons , and thus mainly measures the low - temperature mb core , while the latter arises from collisional excitation of high - energy electrons .",
    "it follows that ones may obtain a lower @xmath2(bj ) relative to @xmath2 ( [ ] ) under the traditional assumption of mb eeds .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath15 values of an isotropic plasma can be derived by comparing the bj intensity , @xmath27/i({\\rm h11})$]@xmath28 , and the nebular - to - auroral line ratio of [ ] , @xmath21([])@xmath29[]@xmath30 .",
    "@xcite have simulated the fb spectrum with mb eeds .",
    "a similar method can be used to calculate the bj with @xmath0 eeds , in which @xmath31 was substituted for @xmath32 .",
    "the dependence of the bj intensity on @xmath0 and @xmath15 has been elucidated in zlz . at a particular @xmath15 value",
    ", a lower @xmath0 index leads to a higher @xmath33 .",
    "we use the same approach as in zlz to simulate the bj intensity . in order to normalize @xmath33 , we take the effective recombination coefficients of h11 under @xmath0 eeds , @xmath34(h11 ) , recently tabulated by @xcite . for either recombination or collision processes , the rate coefficient is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the electron mass , and @xmath37 is the relevant cross - section . in order to simulate the fb transition ,",
    "the recombination cross - section , @xmath37 , is determined from the photoionization cross - section through the milne relation . then @xmath34(h11 ) can be deduced by solving the collisional - radiative recombination problem . @xcite",
    "performed such calculations , and derived the @xmath34(h11 ) values at various combinations of @xmath0 , temperature , and density .",
    "the dependence of @xmath21 ( [ ] ) on @xmath0 and @xmath15 can be obtained by solving the level populations for the five - level atomic model , for which we require the effective collision strengths with @xmath0 eeds . in principle",
    ", the effective collision strengths can be determined from equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) if we have the collisional cross - section , @xmath37 . however , the cross sections are difficult to be tabulated and are not always available in literature .",
    "recently , @xcite calculated the @xmath0-dependent effective collision strengths for electron collision excitation of the [ ] cels .",
    "we have taken their reported data for the calculations of @xmath21 ( [ ] ) .",
    "since the non - thermal electrons would strengthen the auroral lines more than the nebular lines , the @xmath21 ( [ ] ) value decreases with decreasing @xmath0 values .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] plots the theoretical predictions of @xmath33 versus @xmath21 ( [ ] ) as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath15 , as well as those of mb eeds .",
    "the calculations are essentially independent of @xmath25 because the critical densities for the involved lines are much larger than the typical nebular density .",
    "therefore , we have assumed a constant @xmath25 of 10@xmath38@xmath39 for all the calculations .",
    "an inspection of figure  [ fig1 ] shows that @xmath33 and @xmath21 ( [ ] ) are more sensitive to the @xmath0 index at low temperature .",
    "with increasing @xmath15 , the peak of eeds shift towards higher energy , and thus more electrons with energy lying within the mb core can contribute to the excitation of [ ] cels . as a result",
    ", the @xmath33 versus @xmath21 ( [ ] ) relations would converge to that of mb eeds at higher temperature . as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , the @xmath0 index can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy from the observed @xmath33 and @xmath21 ( [ ] ) in the regions of @xmath40 and @xmath41k .",
    "the basic idea of this method is similar to that of @xcite through comparing @xmath2(bj ) and @xmath2 ( [ ] ) .",
    "but the approach of @xcite contains some approximations , e.g. , the rate coefficients are approximately obtained ( see section  1 and the discussion in ss ) , and they have assumed @xmath42 .",
    "these approximations are generally justified , but would lead to larger uncertainties for low @xmath0 index .",
    "in contrast , we have used the most recently reported atomic data , and thus are able to provide a more robust estimate of the @xmath0 index .",
    "based upon the @xmath2(bj ) versus @xmath2 ( [ ] ) diagrams , @xcite concluded that pne and regions have typical @xmath0 indices of larger than 10 .",
    "however , they did not present the @xmath0 values for individual nebulae . in the present work we attempt to determine the @xmath0 indices for a sample of gaseous nebulae , including 82 pne and 10 regions .",
    "the data utilized were taken from work recently published by our research group and others ( see tables  [ pn ] & [ h2 ] ) .",
    "these high signal - to - noise spectra have been obtained with the purpose of investigating the rl / cel discrepancy problem . with careful flux calibrations and dereddening corrections as well as accurate measurements of the balmer jump , they are particularly well suited for our analysis . in some cases , where the @xmath33 values are not explicitly given in the literature",
    ", we deduced the @xmath33 values through the @xmath2(bj ) versus @xmath33 relation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their equation  ( 3 ) ) .",
    "the observed @xmath33 and @xmath21 ( [ ] ) values are overplotted in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "as the data are taken from different references , the measurement uncertainties are not available for all the observed values .",
    "we roughly estimate a typical error bar from our spectra , as shown in the lower right corner of this figure .",
    "the [ ] cels are relatively strong , and thus @xmath21 ( [ ] ) can be obtained with high accuracy .",
    "the uncertainty of the @xmath0 index mainly comes from the measurement of the balmer jump , and it steeply increases with increasing @xmath0 and @xmath15 . if the eeds follow single mb distributions , all the plotted points should lie on the dashed curve in figure  [ fig1 ] . however , most of them fall on the upper left of that curve , which can be explained in terms of @xmath0 eeds . there are a very small number of data points lying on the far lower right of the dashed curve , e.g. the regions of @xmath43 ( [ ] )",
    ". we can tentatively attribute this to shock heating in the outer low - ionized regions and/or the possible existence of metal - poor clumps , although the exact reason remains unclear .",
    "the resultant @xmath0 and @xmath15 , along with the other nebular properties , are given in tables  [ pn ] & [ h2 ] for pne and regions , respectively .",
    "in these tables , @xmath25 is the average value of electron densities obtained by various @xmath25-diagnostics available in the literature , and the effective density under @xmath0 eeds , @xmath44 , is obtained through multiplying @xmath25 by a factor of @xmath21 ( see section  2.1 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , some data points are too close to the mb predictions to allow reliable determinations of @xmath0 , and we can only estimate a lower limit of 60 . excluding those with @xmath45 , we finally give the @xmath0 indices of 47 pne and 8 regions .",
    "the errors of @xmath0 can be inferred graphically from figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it should be cautious in using the resultant values in the high-@xmath0 and/or high-@xmath15 regions for further analysis . as is clear in figure  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "pne distribute in more scattering and higher temperature regions than regions in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath15 ) parameter space .",
    "we obtain the average values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the 47 pne and 8 regions , respectively , suggesting that pne probably have a systematically greater departure from mb eeds than regions .",
    "we did not find very extreme pne with @xmath48 .",
    "the average @xmath0 index in nebulae is far larger than those in most of the other space plasmas ( see table  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is close to that of the low solar corona ( 1025 ; * ? ? ?",

    "are respectively determined from @xmath51(bj ) and @xmath21 ( [ ] ) under the assumption of mb eeds . in the scenario of @xmath0 eeds ,",
    "the two parameters retrieved from @xmath51(bj ) and @xmath21 ( [ ] ) are substituted with @xmath0 and @xmath15 .",
    "namely , a consistent temperature @xmath15 can be obtained through adjusting the @xmath0 index .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 should be a value between @xmath49 and @xmath50)$ ] , as confirmed in those tables .",
    "since the @xmath0 index is introduced for the purpose of interpreting the temperature discrepancy , @xmath52)-t_{\\rm e}({\\rm bj})$ ] , it is expected to be negatively correlated with @xmath53 .",
    "such a correlation can be seen in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the @xmath0 index can be fitted to the expression @xmath54 where @xmath53 is in the unit of @xmath55k .",
    "equation  ( [ fitkappa ] ) can be used to conveniently determine the @xmath0 index from the previously reported @xmath49 and @xmath50)$ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] also shows the histograms of @xmath0 and @xmath53 , where pne clearly exhibit an extended tail towards low @xmath0 and high @xmath53 , and there is no region showing @xmath56 .",
    "it has been well established that the rl / cel temperature and abundance discrepancies are two relevant problems .",
    "a positive correlation between adfs and @xmath53 has been found in a small sample of pne by @xcite , suggesting that the two discrepancies are probably caused by a common underlying physical mechanism .",
    "if this is the case , we would expect that there exists a negative correlation between @xmath0 and adfs .",
    "figure  [ kvadf ] plots @xmath0 against adfs , in which we indeed observe a loose negative correlation for our pn sample .",
    "the relationship between @xmath57 and @xmath58(adf ) is clearly non - linear , but similar to that between @xmath57 and @xmath53 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , shows a ` l'-shape in figure  [ kvadf ] .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite who found a strong linear correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath58(adf ) . for regions ,",
    "however , the correlation coefficient is too low to be meaningful .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution provides a potential solution for the rl / cel discrepancy problem , as illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] . using equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) ,",
    "our results show that about @xmath59 and @xmath60 electrons are non - thermal in pne and regions , respectively , suggesting that only minority of non - thermal electrons are able to account for the @xmath2(bj)/@xmath2 ( [ ] ) discrepancy .",
    "@xcite discussed the possible formation of @xmath0 eeds in gaseous nebulae .",
    "because the thermalization timescale of free electrons is proportional to the cube of the velocity , high - energy electrons may approach to equilibration state slower than their injection .",
    "therefore , if energetic electrons could be continually and quickly injected , the @xmath0 distribution would be developed .",
    "a key question is what the mechanism continually pumping and maintaining stable @xmath0 eeds could be in pne and regions .",
    "the possibilities presented by @xcite include magnetic reconnections , local shocks , photoionization of dust , and x - ray ionization .",
    "the @xmath0 indices determined in the present paper provide a useful foundation for investigating the postulated generation of non - thermal electrons .",
    "for that purpose , in this section we examine the correlations between @xmath0 indices and other nebular properties .",
    "figure  [ kvt ] shows that there is no apparent linear correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath15 for pne . for cooler nebulae",
    ", a more significant fraction of electrons lying in the power - law high - energy tail contributes to the excitation of [ ] cels in that the mb core is confined within a lower - energy region and thus has less contribution to the collisional excitation .",
    "this points to a positive correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , the situation is complicated by the fact that the suprathermal heating caused by energetic stellar winds can increase the kinetic temperature and decrease the @xmath0 index , as suggested by @xcite",
    ". a visual examination of figure  [ kvt ] seems to reveal that the @xmath0 index roughly increases with increasing @xmath15 , but significantly decreases at the highest temperature .",
    "although this behavior can be explained in terms of @xmath0 eeds , it can not be viewed as a solid support for the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "figure  [ kvt ] also suggests a stronger positive correlation for regions than pne .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the cause of rl / cel discrepancies in regions differs from that in pne .",
    "we require a larger sample and more sophisticated study to ascertain this .",
    "in figure  [ kvec ] we plot @xmath0 against the excitation class ( ec ) of pne .",
    "the excitation class can be determined from spectral line ratios , and is closely related to the effective temperature of the central stars .",
    "we calculated the ecs of pne following the formalism suggested by @xcite , as tabulated in table  [ pn ] .",
    "although the classification scheme was developed for the magellanic cloud pne , it should be able to serve as a measurement of the relative excitation conditions in galactic pne .",
    "figure  [ kvec ] demonstrates that no correlation exists between @xmath0 and ec .",
    "we therefore do not find a trend that more pronounced departure from mb eeds corresponds to harder radiation fields .",
    "consequently , we can not give any empirical evidence for the photoionzation by the radiation from central stars as the cause of non - thermal electron production .",
    "is it possible that the non - thermal electrons are generated by the kinetic energy released by the mass loss ?",
    "ngc40 and ngc1501 are two pne with wolf - rayet type central stars that are characterized by fast stellar winds and high mass - loss rates .",
    "we only discover moderate @xmath0 indices for the two pne , while those with the lowest @xmath0 indices are not wolf - rayet pne .",
    "furthermore , @xcite investigated the abundances of a sample of pne with [ wc]-type nucleus , and found that there is no discernible relation between the [ wc ] nature and the adfs .",
    "therefore , we can conclusively rule out the possibility that stellar winds are the main source producing non - thermal electrons .",
    "we also examine the @xmath0 indices by classifying the pne according to their morphologies and peimbert types ( see the 10th column of table  [ pn ] ) .",
    "the morphologies of our sample pne can be classified as bipolar ( b ) , elliptical ( e ) , round ( r ) , and quasi - stellar ( s ) .",
    "their mean @xmath0 indices are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "given the large standard deviations and small sample numbers in each group , we do not detect statistically significant differences of the @xmath0 indices between the pne of different morphologies .",
    "the peimbert type @xcite can roughly reflect the stellar population of the galaxy .",
    "we used the peimbert - type classification method introduced by @xcite .",
    "type i pne descend from high - mass progenitors , and represent the youngest population , while type iv pne represent the oldest population in halo .",
    "we derive the mean @xmath0 index of type i pne to be @xmath65 , slightly larger than that of non - type i pne ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "there are a few type iv pne exhibiting very low @xmath0 indices ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this is consistent with previous findings that young pne have systematically smaller adfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the @xmath0 distribution holds in pne , it is hard to understand why more deviations from thermal equilibrium can be developed in older pne .    to reside in stationary states out of thermal equilibrium",
    ", the energetic electrons must be non - collisional .",
    "collisionless plasma can be characterized by small ratio between the debye length , @xmath68 and the mean free path , @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) lower than one .",

    "the @xmath0 indices obtained in nebule are generally larger than those in solar system plasma .",
    "it should be noted that our plots are not contrary to those of @xcite as they examined a much wider parameter space .",

    "zlz determined the @xmath0 indices of four pne through fitting their fb continuities .",
    "three of them are included in our sample",
    ". however , the present method yields larger @xmath0 indices for the three pne than those obtained by zlz . because the fb emission samples the electrons with lower energy than the [ ] cels do , if the physical conditions of pne are inhomogeneous we may obtained different results from the two methods .",
    "therefore , it seems inappropriate to use a single @xmath0 value to characterize the eed of a given pn .",
    "to further clarify this point , we need to investigate the behavior of other temperature diagnostic lines in @xmath0 eeds , such as the [ ] cel ratio .",
    "the main difficulty to perform such a study is that the cross sections of collision are difficult to be tabulated , and thus are usually unavailable in the literature .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a method to approximate @xmath0 distributions as a sum of mb distributions , which provides an easy way to convert the existing rate coefficients with mb eeds to those with @xmath0 eeds .",

    "however , we can not find sound evidence supporting that non - thermal electrons can be pumped in pne and regions .",
    "for three extreme pne , the currently obtained @xmath0 indices are larger than those by zlz utilizing the fb continuum . in order to interpret this discrepancy within the framework of @xmath0 eeds ,",
    "spatial variations of @xmath0 and @xmath15 are required .",
    "given the scale of @xmath0 distributions in the solar system , it is possible that such distributions may be present over small scales in nebular regions , and would be likely detected , should they exist , in nearby nebulae utilizing future high - resolution high - sensitivity facilities such as the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) .    despite the difficulties to identify the orgin of non - thermal electrons , the present study can not rule out the existence of the @xmath0 distribution in pne and regions .",
    "this scenario provides an intriguing possibility to solve some observational puzzles in nebulae .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution can greatly affect thermal and ionization structures of nebulae and , if proven true , should be incorporated into photoionization models .",
    "one such attempt has been made by @xcite who modified the photoionization code , mappings , to investigate the effect of @xmath0 eeds on abundance determination of regions .",
    "it would be a useful addition to applications such as cloudy @xcite , as a means of exploring the possible diagnostic symptoms of @xmath0 eeds .",
    "apparently , it is extremely important to develop methods to detect eeds from observations .",
    "we hope that the results reported in this paper can serve as a useful reference to further address this issue .",
