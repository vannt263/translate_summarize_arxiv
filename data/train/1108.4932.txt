    "given conditions on parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , coming from existing measurements in the accelerators , e.g. from a measurement of the structure function @xmath5 in dis , through a fixed order ( lo , nlo , ... ) formula from pqcd for @xmath5 , or a given cross section for __pp__ scattering in a similar manner , can be considered as the initial conditions for the pdfs in the integro - differential dglap evolution equations of the same order in perturbation ; based on which solving the dglap equations generally allows pqcd prediction for processes of interest in accelerators .",
    "thus , the method of solution of dglap proposed in the year 2000@xcite , and developed here can be of serious interest . for simplicity",
    "the method is illustrated at lo.dglap evolution equation is of the simple one dimensional form for the non - singlet quark distribution @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 in the more traditional form of dglap the l.h.s .",
    "derivative is with respect to @xmath9. @xmath10 here , the strong coupling constant @xmath11 is rendered in lo in the historical approach@xcite , using a constant of integration @xmath12 , being in the range @xmath13 , signaling the qcd confinement , where the coupling becomes very strong ; e.g. as hinted in lo , ( [ eq.3 ] ) .",
    "we will use the lo formula ([eq.3]) for the strong coupling constant consistently throughout the calculations later on , avoiding the ambiguities and resulting mistakes that may arise if definition is varied .",
    "the present day approach bypasses the ambiguities by directly using experimental determination of @xmath14 with no recourse to @xmath15@xcite.    dglap evolution equation has two dimensional form for the singlet quark distribution @xmath16 , coupled to gluons:@xmath17 at lo , where equality of splitting functions ( neglecting quark masses ) , leaves only four different ones , the evolution equation can be written in a simple @xmath18 dimensional form for the @xmath19 quark and ant - iquark flavors coupled through the gluon distribution : @xmath20    ",
    "analytical solutions to dglap exploits nearness of the discrete data points of a given set , e.g. of the structure functions , to the bjorken @xmath21 , @xmath22 numerical solutions can simply use the exact bjorken @xmath23 of the data set . in either case , a discrete set of __n__ basis vectors for the pdfs is defined on each @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the splitting functions operating on this basis ( space ) can be calculated as @xmath24 matrices .",
    "the discrete basis for the pdfs are used in the convolution integrals on the right side of the dglap equation to produce the matrix form of the kernel k , which in dis data analysis , is either the splitting functions for dglap , or the coefficient functions of the hadronic structure function .",
    "the convolution integrals are of the generic form : @xmath25 in which , for the simplest parton distribution function , e.g. non - singlet ( ns ) @xmath26, the discrete basis is an @xmath27tuple , whose __i__th element is @xmath28 . as the convolution integral is made a discrete sum , @xmath29 or @xmath30 within the kernel @xmath31 become lower triangular ( l.t . ) , due to the limits of integration of the resulting sum ; and banded ( bdd ) , due to divisions of @xmath32 in ( [eq.1]). the resulting algebraic simplicity of the l.t .",
    "bdd matrices is an essential element for having analytical solution of dglap as the basis of the analysis .",
    "evidently , numerical solution working with exact @xmath33 of the data neither works with , nor requires bandedness .",
    "+       to calculate the matrix form of a splitting function , e.g. @xmath34 in ( [eq.1 ] ) , a combination of discrete finite difference approximation of the unknown pdfs and continuous integration of the known splitting functions is mixed in our method of evaluation of the convolution , as follows",
    ". then , @xmath35 is extracted from the coefficients of @xmath36. at lo , @xmath37 is given in the following equivalent forms@xcite : @xmath38 .",

    "note that the dglap equation can be written for momentum distribution , i.e , in @xmath44 , by putting an extra @xmath45 on both sides , and a factor of @xmath46 within the integral .",
    "different techniques may be used for doing the integration in dglap . here",
    ", we use only integration by parts : @xmath47 so , @xmath48 .",

    "bringing in a finite difference approximation of the differentials : @xmath50 now , a bdd l.t .",
    "@xmath51 can be read ( extracted ) from the coefficients of @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 the other three kernels are essentially obtained in a similar manner .",
    "in addition , construction of the matrix coefficient functions in @xmath54 which are taken from@xcite , follows closely the path of construction of splitting functions , resulting in commuting , bdd , l.t . or non - commuting , non - bdd , l.t .",
    "matrices , respectively , in analytical or more general numerical approaches .    ",
    "in this section , the numerical solution of the dglap equations ( [eq.1] ) , ( [eq.4] ) and ( [eq.5] ) is explained in detail .",
    "the dglap equations are of the generic form : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is one dimensional in non - singlet , two dimensional in singlet and @xmath57 dimensional in flavor kernels , respectively.having the matrix forms of the above kernels from section ( 2 ) , the matrix form of dglap equations reads as : @xmath58 since the kernel k being independent of the variable @xmath59 , leads the following solution to the matrix equation ( [eq.15] ) for finite evolution from @xmath60 to @xmath59 : @xmath61 therefore , the finite evolution machinery for the dglap , is constructed with the final @xmath62 dependent @xmath63 matrix .    to determine the matrix form of @xmath64 in analytical framework of@xcite , as mentioned in the previous sections , the choice of @xmath65 is mandatory to have commuting bdd splitting functions matrices , but the experimental data are not always match these @xmath66 points , so interpolation techniques should be used to shift the data points to the desired places.on the other hand , given the numeric form of the lo kernels @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 to a software such as __mathematica__ ( using the matrixexp command ) , immediately gives the matrix form of the exponential in the solution ( [eq.16 ] ) .",
    "using numerical algorithms to approximate the infinite series of the exponential has the advantage of being needless of the commuting bdd matrices , so , ones could chose the experimental @xmath45 to discrete the @xmath45 space .    ",
    "the machinery thus far has brought us to the point that we may take a discrete set of input pdfs at x - points patterned according to ( [eq.6] ) at @xmath60 from some present standard lo set , such as mstw2008 , evolve it ourselves to @xmath59 , and then compare our results with their pdfs at @xmath59 .",
    "this is actually done via an @xmath70 ( [eq.6] ) input taken at @xmath71 from mstw ( green curves ) .",
    "evolution needs the value of @xmath72 which , in the line of the discussion of equation ( [eq.3] ) , was handled using @xmath73 consistently .",
    "the excellent quality of match of our solutions outputs at @xmath74 ( red curves ) and mstw pdfs ( blue curves ) can be seen in fig.([fig:1]-i ) for non - singlet - singlet , and in fig.([fig:1]-ii ) for the flavors.definitions of 5 flavor non - singlets and the singlet are : @xmath75    a surprise is that , we assume complete @xmath76(flavor ) symmetry with our up to @xmath77 , or flavor dglap kernel ( [eq.5] )",
    ". then , an @xmath70 point fit has such a good match with mstw2008 that says they should be having such an @xmath76 symmetry assumption as well .",
    "the only source of asymmetry in both our procedures seems to be the non- symmetric pdfs inputs to the totally symmetric evolution process , resulting in the asymmetric outputs .",
    "a similar comparison is shown in figure([fig:1]-iii ) with the older lo cteq5l set .",
    "it is interesting to note that the excellent match , points to their @xmath76 symmetry assumption as well.there is only a final step needed to have the detailed match observed in the figures . while solving dglap , flavor number changes should be accommodated every time a changing @xmath78 crosses a massive quarks @xmath79 .",
    "accordingly , a simple method of continuous evolution across stages with breaks at @xmath80 was conceived , which may be called zero - mass scheme .",
    "a more involved zero - mass scheme is found in mstw @xcite .",
    "but there is no apparent difference for our lo comparison ! in both ,",
    "as mentioned there , the name zero - mass is misleading , as mass appears in the boundary conditions . continuity of pdfs is kept via the boundary conditions of the dglap at breaks at @xmath80 .",
    "specifically , a break takes place if evolution of the pdfs , during increase of @xmath81 ( [eq.2] ) , from @xmath19 flavors at @xmath60 , crosses a @xmath82 , of a massive quark @xmath83 , to reach @xmath59 with @xmath84 flavors .",
    "then , solving dglap for finite evolutions @xmath85 $ ] is divided into two stages of @xmath86 $ ] and@xmath87 $ ] . furthermore , there are two sets of inputs , the first set has @xmath19 flavors at @xmath60 , the second set has @xmath88 flavors at @xmath89 . in addition , the second set of inputs is the first set of outputs with an extra input pdf for the heavy quark , @xmath90 .",
    "specifically , in our figures , h= b - quark with mstw @xmath91 , and cteq @xmath92 .",
    "beginning with lo structure function @xmath5 symbolically as : @xmath94 with the quark structure function in term of @xmath95 flavors ns - s , with usual definitions ( [eq.17])@xcite , @xmath96    now , we are ready to actualize the program explained at the onset . each @xmath97 data point at a given @xmath98 of an experiment , e.g. bcdms@xcite , is decomposed into its partonic components via ( [eq.18] ) and ( [eq.19] ) , evolved by our solutions of dglap , from a set of unknown parton distributions at @xmath99 to be solved for by the linear system of equations for all the data and the variable flavor number ( vfn ) constraints .",
    "our data equations come from minimization of @xmath100 with respect to the unknowns , with the usually defined@xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the value of data point on the left side of ( [eq.18 ] ) with its quadratically calculated total error being @xmath103 , and @xmath104 is its lo decomposition corresponding to the right side of ( [eq.18 ] ) . for",
    "the range of @xmath78 used , the vfn constraint equations are set at the masses of __c__ and __b__ quarks , considered as boundary conditions ( b.c . ) between regions of evolution in @xmath78 where @xmath19 respectively crosses 3- 4 , and 4 - 5 .",
    "constraints equate the singlet , @xmath105 , and the @xmath106 -multiplet ns of the @xmath107 flavor symmetry above each b.c . ;",
    "thus , dropping the flavor number , @xmath19 , by 1 at the b.c .",
    "the constraint equations , together with consistent evolution , keep the continuity of the pdfs while the flavor numbers changes at the b.c .    ",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , each data point serves as a constraint equation on pdfs . a measurement of the structure function @xmath5 in dis , through a fixed order ( lo , nlo,@xmath108 ) formula from pqcd for @xmath5 , or a given cross section for __pp__ scattering in a similar manner , can be considered as such a constraint equation .",
    "the integro - differential dglap evolution equations of the same order in perturbation may then be solved and used to tie all the data points in an over determined and numerically singular system of linear equations to be solved via singular value decomposition ( svd)@xcite together with other constraint equations on the pdfs coming from variable flavor numbers ( vfn ) pertinent to the @xmath78 range of the data . here",
    ", the presented method of solution of dglap , becomes of serious interest .",
    "the presentation here is done at lo , for the simplest example of dis data , @xmath97 from bcdms collaboration@xcite ; however , it is treated in general terms for other applications and applicable to be extended through pdf global data analysis as well as higher orders of perturbation .",
    "solutions for the pdfs are presented in figure([fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the error analysis comes from error propagation equation@xcite , applied on the output of the solved system of equations . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed no correlation among experimental errors .",
    "total number of used data points , for proton and deuteron respectively , are @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "number of data equations ( same as the number of unknowns ) obtained from @xmath100 are 6(pdfs ) @xmath111(x - points ) , and those obtained from b.c .",
    "are 2(b.c.)@xmath111(x - points ) and @xmath112 . noting that mstw2008lo pdfs are coming from global fits with the total number of 2615 data points from 36 data sets .",
    "we have developed in detail , analytical linear algebraic solution to dglap , with its numerical presentation , employed it in doing non - parametric data analysis ; i.e. obtaining pdfs directly from data points without a pre - assumed parametric form .",
    "our results for finite lo evolution match those of the simply available standard lo sets : mstw2008 and cteq5l .",
    "in addition , the obtained parton distributions agree with the sophisticated mstw and cteq global data analysis .    ",
