    "the observation of neutrinoless double-@xmath0 @xmath5 decays would demonstrate the majorana nature of neutrinos  @xcite , representing direct evidence for physics beyond the standard model . neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay is a second - order electroweak process where a nucleus decays through the emission of two electrons , @xmath6 , thereby violating lepton number . the half - life of the isotope decaying through @xmath7 decay is given by @xmath8^{-1 } = g^{0\\nu } |m^{0\\nu}|^2 \\frac{m_{\\beta\\beta}^2}{m_e^2 } \\ ; , \\label{eqn : halflife}\\ ] ] assuming the exchange of a light majorana neutrino ( mass mechanism ) . here , @xmath9 is the electron mass .",
    "the phase space factors @xmath10 and nuclear matrix elements @xmath11 vary with isotope .",
    "the decay rate is proportional to the square of the effective neutrino mass @xmath1 , which represents a coherent sum over the masses @xmath12 of the neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath13 weighted by the squares of the corresponding elements @xmath14 of the pontecorvo maki nakagawa sakata ( pmns ) matrix and the majorana phases @xmath15 and @xmath0 .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is the most common model for neutrino mass generation  @xcite . here ,",
    "heavy right - handed neutrinos mix with the left - handed neutrinos and generate light majorana masses for the active neutrinos .",
    "in addition to the exchange of these light majorana neutrinos , there are several other potential models  @xcite that could contribute to @xmath7 decays , e.g. , left - right symmetric models , @xmath16-parity violating supersymmetry , or models with extra dimensions . observing @xmath7 decays with different isotopes could help to disentangle these mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the search for @xmath7 decays is pursued in a range of experiments that use different isotopes .",
    "experiments where detector material and @xmath7 isotope are identical are constrained in the choice of isotope by the detector technology .",
    "this approach is employed by collaborations such as gerda  @xcite , which uses a high - purity @xmath17 detector , exo-200  @xcite and  @xcite , which contain enriched @xmath18 , and cuoricino  @xcite and cuore-0  @xcite , bolometers made of teo@xmath19 crystals containing @xmath20 .",
    "alternatively , detector and isotope can be separated , which allows experiments such as nemo-3  @xcite to study a variety of isotopes , e.g. , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is therefore important to develop techniques to combine the data taken by different experiments with a range of isotopes .",
    "this allows us to make quantitative comparisons between experiments , to study the consistency of their results , and to obtain combined limits on @xmath1 .",
    "a previous comparison of different experimental results using the published limits on @xmath23 has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "we simultaneously fit the experimental energy distributions to obtain a combined limit .",
    "such a direct combination of the results for multiple isotopes requires a specific nme calculation to relate the half - lives of the various isotopes before deriving a limit on @xmath1 .",
    "we chose a set of commonly used nme models to perform the combinations , but the procedure is generally applicable to include any nme model .",
    "the combination of the experimental energy distributions is performed for each particular nme model . in principle",
    ", different models could give a better estimate of the nmes for different isotopes , but this case is not considered here , since it would require determining systematic correlations between the different models .",
    "the final limits on @xmath1  are given as a range covering the full set of nme models , following the procedure normally employed by individual experiments .",
    "we take into account theoretical uncertainties on the calculations where they are available .    in this article , we present a method based on the published energy distributions from all recent experiments and use it to derive a first combined limit on @xmath1 based on multiple isotopes .",
    "we first demonstrate that we can reproduce the published half - life limits of each individual experiment , before performing the combination using different nme calculations .",
    "we study the consistency of the combined @xmath1 limit with the positive claim of the heidelberg - moscow experiment  @xcite .",
    "we also interpret the combined limit on @xmath1 as a constraint on a @xmath4 model with three active and one sterile majorana neutrinos .",
    "limits are calculated using the _ cl_@xmath24 method  @xcite , which applies a modified - frequentist approach using a poisson log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) test statistic .",
    "the value of _ cl_@xmath24 is defined as the @xmath3 value of the data under the hypothesis that we observe both signal and background , _",
    "cl_@xmath25 , divided by the @xmath3 value for the background - only hypothesis ( _ cl_@xmath26 ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties are marginalized through gaussian constraints on the priors , with the best fits of these parameters determined by maximizing the likelihood with respect to the data in both the signal - plus - background and background - only hypotheses .",
    "a limit at the @xmath27  confidence level ( cl ) is obtained from the signal strength that produces a value of _ cl_@xmath28 .",
    "the expected limit corresponds to the median of an ensemble of pseudo - experiments generated from the background - only probability distributions , and the @xmath29 standard deviation ranges are derived from the ensemble .",
    "when combining multiple experiments , the limit setting process uses a sum of the experiments individual llrs , assuming no correlations .    for a single experiment ,",
