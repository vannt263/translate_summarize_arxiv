    "bl lacertae objects and high polarization sources called as flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) together constitute a violently variable class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) known as blazars ( e.g. , blandford & rees 1978 , ghisellini et al .",
    "common blazar characteristics include high polarization , synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet , rapid flux variability , core - dominated radio morphology , flat radio spectrum and many more owing to the relativistic motion of plasma in the jets extending on even mpc scales , pointing at angles @xmath0 10@xmath1 with the line of sight ( los ) thus causing the observed emission to be relativistically beamed ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) . blazars are known to be variable at all accessible time scales over entire electro - magnetic spectra .",
    "magnitude changes of few hundredth to tenths over a time scale of a day is called intraday variability ( idv ) or micro - variability ( wagner & witzel 1995 , rector & perlman 2003 ) which help us in probing innermost regions of agns ; changes from several days to few months are usually known as short time variability ( stv ) ; while those taking from several months to many years are usually called long term variability ( ltv ; gupta et al .",
    "2004 ) , in last two classes blazar variability can usually exceed even @xmath2 5 mag .",
    "flux variability usually leads to spectral changes due to the changes in the spectra of emitting electrons along with the activity associated with the relativistic doppler boosted jets .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars display two well - defined broad spectral components ( mukherjee et al . 1997 ; weekes 2003 ) .",
    "based on the location of these peaks , we have low energy peaked blazars ( lbls ) whose first component peaks in near - ir ( nir)/optical while the second component usually peaks at gev energies and high energy peaked blazars ( hbls ) where first peak is in uv / x - rays while the second peak at tev energies ( padovani & giommi 1995 , abdo et al.2010 ) . during flaring state the peak",
    "is found to be shifted towards higher frequencies .",
    "spectral properties were linked with the source luminosity by fossati et al .",
    "( 1997 ) such that hbls were the low luminosity objects with high space density and high electron density thus high magnetic field while the objects with high luminosity , low space density plus low magnetic field were named lbls . ratio of x - ray flux in the 0.3 - 3.5 kev band to the radio flux density at 5ghz is also used to classify as low - synchrotron - peaked or high - synchrotron - peaked blazars ( lsps or hsps ) based on whether the ratio is smaller or greater than 10@xmath3 respectively ( padovani & giommi 1996 ) .",
    "in addition to lsps and hsps we also have intermediate synchrotron peaked blazars ( isps ) also for which sed peaks are located at intermediate frequencies ( sambruna , maraschi & urry 1996 ) .",
    "one can also define lsps as those blazars with energy peak frequency of their synchrotron hump , @xmath4 @xmath2 10@xmath5  hz , isps as those with @xmath4",
    "@xmath2 10@xmath6  hz while those with @xmath4",
    "@xmath2 10@xmath7  hz as hsps .",
    "the above classification was proposed by nieppola , tornikoski & voltaoja ( 2006 ) based on the studies of 300 bl lacertae objects . from the observational point of view",
    "it has been found that lbls are more optically variable than hbls ( stocke et al .  1985 ; 1989 ; heidt & wagner 1996 )    bl lacertae ( @xmath8 = 22h 02 m 43.29s",
    "@xmath9 = @xmath10 ) located at a redshift value of z = 0.069 ( miller & hawley 1977 ) with a moderately bright elliptical host galaxy ( wurtz , stocke & yee 1996 ) , is a prototype of the blazar class of agns which has been intensively studied since its discovery by schmitt ( 1968 ) with radio source vro 42.22.01 and characterized by a featureless spectrum . bl lacertae is classified as a low - frequency peaked blazar ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ; abdo et al .  2010 ) with first component of its sed peaking in near - ir ( nir)/optical region which can be explained by synchrotron emission from the helical jet ( raiteri et al .  2009 ) , thus making optical studies of the bl lacertae helpful to understand them in greater detail .",
    "optical observations can also indicate the possible presence of other components in addition to synchrotron continuum .",
    "there is good evidence for the presence of idv and colour variability in some bl lacertae objects and our source is among those ( e.g. , carini et al .",

    "comparison stars used for differential photometry of the blazar are stars b and c of the finding chart from the webpage . since the bl lacertae and the standard stars magnitudes were obtained simultaneously under same air mass and weather conditions , so the flux values are considered reliable . to get the calibrated magnitude of the target , that non variable standard star was chosen which had colour closest to the bl lacertae .",
    "we used matlab software to write additional programs for data processing we observed bl lacertae on continuous 6 nights from 4 nov to 9 nov 2014 quasi - simultaneously in v and r bands to study the idv characteristics of the object and also to search for any possible time lags between these bands .",

    "to investigate variability properties of bl lacertae we used a series of statistical analysis techniques to state that the extracted results are statistically significant .",
    "all these statistical tools are developed using matlab .      to quantify the intraday variability nature of the source we have employed three different statistics ( e.g. , de diego 2010 ) named as c test , f test and @xmath20test .      to claim the variability of the source we used",
    "the most frequently used criterion introduced by romero , cellone , & combi ( 1999 ) , where the variability detection parameter c@xmath27 is defined as the average of @xmath28 and @xmath29 with : @xmath30 here ( bl@xmath31star a ) , ( bl@xmath31star b ) , and ( star a@xmath31star b ) are the differential instrumental magnitudes of the blazar and standard star a , the blazar and standard star b , and standard star a vs.  standard star b determined using aperture photometry of the source and comparison stars , whereas @xmath32(bl@xmath31stara ) , @xmath32(bl@xmath31starb ) and @xmath32(star a@xmath31star b ) are observational scatters of the differential instrumental magnitudes of the blazar@xmath31star a , blazar@xmath31star b , and star a@xmath31star b , respectively , with star a and star b being those two stars having @xmath33 to be minimum . according to the adopted variability criterion , if @xmath34 , then the nominal confidence level of variability detection is @xmath35% ( jang & miller 1997 ; stalin et al .",
    "2004 ; gupta et al .",
    "if observations are done in three or more than three filters then c@xmath27 value should be @xmath36 2.576 in at least two filters for the source to be reported variable .",
    "de diego ( 2010 ) mentioned the c - test to be too conservative in quantifying variability .",
    "f test is considered to be a proper statistics to test any changes of variability .",
    "f values compare two sample variances and are calculated as : @xmath37 here ( bl - star a ) , ( bl - star b ) , and ( star a - star b ) are the differential instrumental magnitudes of blazar and star a , blazar and star b , and star a and star b , respectively , while var(bl - star a ) , var(bl - star b ) , and var(star a - star b ) are the variances of differential instrumental magnitudes .",
    "we take the average of @xmath38 and @xmath39 to find a mean observational f value .",
    "the f value is then compared with @xmath40 , a critical value , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively denote the number of degrees of freedom for the blazar and star , while @xmath43 is the significance level set as 0.1 and 1 percent ( i.e @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) for our analysis .",
    "if the mean f value is larger than the critical value , the null hypothesis ( i.e. , that of no variability ) is discarded .",
    "nightly lcs and colour indices are listed as variable if @xmath46 .      to investigate the presence of idv we also performed a @xmath20-test .",
    "the @xmath20 statistic is defined as    @xmath47    where , @xmath48 is the mean magnitude , and the @xmath49th observation yields a magnitude @xmath50 with a corresponding standard error @xmath51 which is due to photon noise from the source and sky , ccd read - out and other non - systematic error sources .",
    "exact quantification of such errors by the iraf reduction package is impractical and it has been found that theoretical errors are smaller than the real errors by a factor of 1.3 - 1.75 ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al .  2003 , gupta et al .  2008 ) which for our data is @xmath21.5 , on average .",
    "so the errors obtained after data reduction should be multiplied by this factor to get better estimates of the real photometric errors .",
    "this statistic is then compared with a critical value @xmath52 where @xmath43 is again the significance level set same as in case of f test while @xmath53 is the degree of freedom .",
    "@xmath54 implies the presence of variability .",
    "the percentage variation on a given night is calculated by using the variability amplitude parameter @xmath55 , introduced by heidt & wagner ( 1996 ) , and defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the maximum and minimum values in the calibrated lcs of the blazar , and @xmath32 is the average measurement error .      to search for and quantify any possible correlations between the optical fluxes we used the dcf technique .",
    "the dcf method was first introduced by edelson & krolik ( 1988 ) . for details on dcf",
    "see hovatta et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ; rani , wiita , & gupta ( 2009 ) , and references therein .",
    "the dcf method is defined as : for each pair of data @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the number of data points , the unbinned discrete correlation function ( udcf ) is @xmath62 where the parameters @xmath63 are the mean values of the two discrete data series @xmath64 , with standard deviations @xmath65 , @xmath66 and measurement errors @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the dcf can be calculated by averaging the udcf values ( @xmath69 in number ) for each time delay @xmath70 lying in the range @xmath71 and is expressed as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the center of the bin of size @xmath74 .",
    "the error is found from the standard deviations of the number of bins used for determining the dcf and is given as : @xmath75    when correlating a data series with itself @xmath76 , we obtain the auto - correlation function ( acf ) with a peak at @xmath77 , indicating the absence of any time lag while any other strong peak indicates the presence of periodicity .",
    "in general , a dcf value @xmath78 implies the two data signals are correlated , while the two anti - correlated data sets have a dcf @xmath79 0 , and a dcf value equal to 0 implies no correlation exists between the two data trains .",
    "additional advantage of this method is that it is suitable for unevenly sampled data as is the case in most astronomical observations .",
    "we observed the blazar bl lacertae on 13 nights in b , v , r , and i passbands which includes quasi - simultaneous observations in v and r passbands on 10 of these 13 nights .",
    "the complete observation log for this blazar is given in table 2 .",
    "intra - night lcs in v and r filters taken quasi - simultaneously are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "we applied c - statistics , f - test and @xmath20-test , as discussed above .",
    "our analysis results on intranight timescales for v and r filters are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the blazar is marked as variable ( var ) if the variability conditions for each test mentioned under section 3.1 are satisfied , while its marked probably variable ( pv ) if conditions for either of the two tests are followed , and finally the quasar is marked non - variable ( nv ) if none of the conditions are met by the target .",
    "the source was found to be in active state during our entire span of observations with clear variability found on 3 nights as evident from the table 3 on 26 oct , 27 oct and 6 nov 2014 in both v and r bands .",
    "there was a prominent variation on 27 october 2014 around jd 245658.35 with amplitude of about @xmath2 0.05 mag followed by another short flaring event around jd 245658.43 of @xmath2 0.04 mag in r passband .",
    "similar trend was found in v passband as shown in figure 2 from which it is evident that the data sets for these events in both the bands are consistent with each other .",
    "the object reached the faintest level of 14.07 mag in r passband which is still @xmath2 1 mag brighter than its historical maximum magnitude as reported by fan & lin ( 2000 ) .",
    "while on the last day of our observation span i.e. , on 22 november , source was found to be the brightest with a magnitude of 15.08 , 14.15 , 13.4 , and 1.624 in b , v , r , and i passbands , respectively , indicating that the source might go into flaring state in near future .",
    "the intra - night variability amplitude was minimum on 22 nov with value 2.96% in r filter while reached maximum value of 18.28% on 27 oct in v passband when source showed @xmath20.18 mag change in 3.5 hours of observation duration in v passband .",
    "as can be seen from the table 3 the amplitude of variability is larger in v band lcs than the r passband lcs .",
    "the amplitude of variations is mostly found to increase with frequency thus implying that the source spectrum becomes flatter when brightness of source increases ( massaro et al .",
    "1998 ) which is also the case with our target .",
    "the average spectral indices quoted in table 4 are calculated simply as ( wierzcholska et al .",
    "2015 ) , @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are effective frequencies of the respective bands ( bessell , castelli , & plez 1998 ) .",
    "the optical continuum of the source was very steep on most of the nights with @xmath83 @xmath84 3.8 indicating strong synchrotron emission from the blazar jet and very less accretion disc contribution .",
    "variation of spectral index with time is shown in figure 5 giving the average spectral index during the entire observation cycle as @xmath2 4.2 .",
    "the stv lc for the target during full monitoring period is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the short term variability amplitude between jd 2456955.5 and jd 2456984.5 was found to increase with frequency i.e followed the same trend as was found on intra - night basis with values in b band @xmath2 81.28% , v band @xmath2 74.40% , r band @xmath2 59.90% and i band @xmath2 59.70% , respectively , calculated using equation ( 4 ) above .",
    "we have also investigated the corresponding variations in ( v - r ) colour indices on intraday basis using the analysis criterion described above and found that the bl lacertae showed hints of colour variations on 2 of the nights i.e. , on 26 and 27 oct 2014 with maximum amplitude of variability reaching 6.94% on 27 oct .",
    "behaviour of ( v - r ) and ( b - i ) with time as shown in figure 1 top panel indicates that colour variation is indeed variable on short term basis . the maximum ( v - r ) colour variation in the source on short timescale was of 0.838 ( between its colour index of 0.826 on jd 2456955.5 and of 0.681 on jd 2456984.5 ) while for ( b - i ) maximum colour variation is found to be 2.726 ( between 2.676 on jd 2456955.5 and 2.460 on the last day of our observation span i.e jd 2456984.5 .",
    "we got large values of ( b - i ) as compared to ( v - r ) as is also evident from figure 1 , which is expected since the standard deviation is likely to increase with frequency separation between two bands .",
    "to search for the presence of any characteristic timescale of variability we performed the auto - correlation function ( acf ) technique discussed in above sections by auto - correlating the r band which gives the acf value of @xmath2 1 with nearly zero time lag and then dropping to negative values on most of the nights . from this",
    "we inferred that the lcs in r band are auto correlated with themselves and any characteristic variability timescale is absent .    from the intraday lcs in figure 2",
    ", we infer the variations to be simultaneous in both the filters which was confirmed by dcf analysis technique as explained in section 3.2 with dcf bin sizes from 1 to 10 minutes .",
    "we are getting a strong peak ( with dcf @xmath2 1 ) at time lag of 0 hrs to 0.007 hrs as clear from the figure 3 . these time lag values can not be considered significant since they are close to the measurement intervals .",
    "the small frequency intervals in the optical regime leading to null time lags implies that the photons in these wavebands are emitting by same physical process and from the same emitting region .",
    "a significant positive lag in v vs r band dcf plots would imply that the v band variations lead those of the r filter .",
    "the v band magnitude vs r band magnitude plots in figure 4 also clearly depicts that the flux variations are well correlated on almost all nights including those when the source was found to be variable indicating that the variability mechanism seems to be same in both the passbands . a linear model of the form",
    "y = mx + c was used to fit these plots whose results are given in table 4 confirming that lcs in both the bands are closely correlated on all those nights when genuine variability was detected .",
    "we then studied the behaviour of the spectral variations with respect to the brightness in v band for our source .",
    "we fitted straight lines ( ci = @xmath85v + @xmath86 ) on each plot of colour index , ci , against v magnitude and fitted values for the slope , @xmath87 , along with constant , @xmath88 , are listed in table 5 .",
    "significant positive correlation ( the null hypothesis probability , @xmath89 ) between colour index and apparent blazar magnitude indicates that the source exhibits a bluer when brighter or redder when fainter trend ( h.e.s.s .  collaboration et al .",
    "2014 ) . in the following analysis ,",
    "the observed magnitudes have been corrected for galactic extinction based on the extinction map of schlegel et al.(1998 ) using ned extinction calculator ( a@xmath90 = 0.901 mag , a@xmath91 = 0.713 mag ) .",
    "the flux from the nucleus of bl lacertae is contaminated by the emissions of its giant elliptical host galaxy .",
    "so the data is also corrected for the host galaxy contribution , using the measurements of nilsson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to estimate the host galaxy emission in the r band which is then used to find the corresponding contributions for the v band ( fukugita et al .  1995 , gaur , gupta , & wiita 2012 ) . during our observations we found that bwb trend was dominant for the source on intra - night timescales since we are getting significant positive correlation ( @xmath89 ) between the v magnitude and ( v - r ) colour index .",
    "we calculated the slope , @xmath87 , and the constant , @xmath88 , along with linear pearson correlation coefficients and the corresponding null hypothesis probability , @xmath92 from the colour - magnitude plots ( v - r colour vs v magnitude ) for the target for each night , as presented in figure 6 . on short term basis",
    "also we found that ( v - r ) colour indices follow the bwb trend indicating hardening of the spectrum as the source brightens with values of @xmath93 = 0.1369 @xmath94 0.001 , @xmath95 = @xmath311.2602 @xmath94 0.01 , @xmath96 = 0.4925 @xmath94 0.002 , and @xmath97 = 0.0000 .",
    "we need dense , high precision data to clearly know about the trend in short term colour behaviour of the bl lacertae .",
    "clear global bwb trend was observed in all 10 nights on intraday timescales with correlation coefficient ranging between 0.4 and 0.9 .",
    "the source brightness was found to have strong bwb chromatism on intraday timescales .",
    "the bwb trend has been found to be predominant in bl lacertae by all optical observations of this source till date during both flaring and steady states ( ghosh et al .",
    "2000 ; gaur et al .",
    "2012 ; gu et al .",
    "2006 ) which was revealed by our observations also .",
    "villata et al .  ( 2004b ) found that the intraday flares followed bwb trend strongly with a slope of @xmath2 0.4 which is also the case for our data with the slopes of the intra - night lcs more than @xmath2 0.4 in majority of cases .",
    "thus , our colour variability results for the source being strongly chromatic between oct - nov 2014 were consistent with those of villata et al .",
    "( 2004b ) .",
    "since the jet emissions are completely dominating the flux from bl lacerate objects , this can be explained by the shock - in - jet models elaborated under section 8 .",
