    "therefore , gcs are so important that they are considered as the fossils of the earliest stages of galaxy formation @xcite . however , at the distance of m31 , construction of colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) below the main sequence turn - off , the most reliable method for age determinations of stellar populations , is extremely challenging for current state - of - the - art instrumentation . here",

    "the study of m31 gcs is complicated , since in most cases we only have access to their integrated spectra and photometry , and can not study the resolved stellar population .",
    "therefore , we can only obtain the key physical parameters , such as the age and metallicity , by analysis of the integrated spectra or photometry .",
    "however , a large body of evidence suggests that there is a strong age - metallicity degeneracy if only optical photometry is used @xcite . a very useful method to break",

    "when we compared the multi - colour photometry of our sample gcs with theoretical stellar synthesis models , we could not obtain a reasonable fit to the sed of one gc , bo131 .",
    "a detailed investigation of the m31 images of batc multi - colour survey of the sky reveals that this gc is superimposed onto a very high and variable background , so that the resulting photometry is highly uncertain .",

    "in addition , there is evidence for a roughly 25 to 50 per cent solar - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath5 to @xmath6 dex ) population of older gcs in the m31 halo ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , while the more metal - poor clusters appear to be scattered throughout the entire disc - halo system ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "this is not surprising in view of the possible selection biases discussed above , while the main galactic disc of m31 may also give rise to redder gc colours owing to the presence of fairly significant dust lanes ( particularly closer to the galactic centre ) .    in section [ agecomp.sec ]",
    ", we will further consider to which extent our gc sample represents that of @xcite .",
    "we also note that although most present catalogues of m31 gcs are not complete , @xcite have shown that the m31 gc population ( including the sample in the bologna catalogue on which the present sample is based ) is currently fairly complete down to @xmath8 mag ( @xmath9 mag ) . as such , we believe that we have not introduced additional photometric biases into our sample selection by using the bologna catalogue as our master list of m31 gcs .",

    "@xcite did not include the photometric uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we refer to the original works as indicated in @xcite . for a number of gcs , for which @xmath16-band photometric uncertainties were not presented in the original references ,",

    "@xcite took the photometry in the @xmath15 bands from @xcite as a reference to obtain a master catalogue of photometric measurements compiled in as homogeneously a fashion as possible .",
    "all other catalogues containing @xmath15 photometry were transformed to this reference by applying the offsets derived from objects in common between the relevant catalogue and the list of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the measurements are internally consistent .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the age - metallicity degeneracy in optical broad - band colours is @xmath17 .",
    "this implies that the composite spectrum of an old stellar population is indistinguishable from that of a younger but more metal - rich population ( and vice versa ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that this degeneracy can be partially broken by adding infrared photometry to the optical colours , depending on the age of the stellar population . @xcite found that the inclusion of an infrared band can improve the predictive power of the stellar population diagnostics by @xmath18 times compared to using optical photometry alone .",
    "@xcite also showed that the use of near - infrared colours can greatly contribute to break the age - metallicity degeneracy . in this paper",
    "we add 2mass photometry to our broad and intermediate - band optical photometry to estimate the gc ages to the highest possible accuracy .    using the 2mass database ,",
    "@xcite identified 693 known and candidate gcs in m31 , and listed their 2mass @xmath19s magnitudes .",
    "@xcite transformed all 2mass magnitudes to the cit photometric system @xcite using the colour transformations in @xcite .",
    "however , we need the original 2mass @xmath19s magnitudes for our sample gcs in order to compare our observational sed to the ssp models , so we reversed this transformation using the same procedures .",
    "since @xcite did not give the photometric 2mass @xmath19s uncertainties , we obtained photometric uncertainties by comparing the photometric magnitudes with fig . 2 of @xcite , who plot the observed photometric rms uncertainties in the time series as a function of magnitude for stars brighter than their observational completeness limits . in fact",
    ", the photometric uncertainties adopted do not affect our results significantly , as we will show below ( see section 4.3 for details ) .    finally , we point out that because of the very long wavelength coverage from @xmath16 to the near - infrared , and the large number of photometric data points for each gc , our age estimates , and in particular the associated uncertainties are highly robust .",
    "in fact , depending on the ( internal ) extinction curve adopted , they are competitive with respect to spectroscopic age determinations based on either a short wavelength range or a limited number of age diagnostics ( where small - scale differences in the continuum level may have significant consequences for the age determinations ) , as discussed extensively in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide convincing support for this statement by showing that spectroscopic age determinations are not necessarily better or more accurate than ages obtained from photometry .",
    "to estimate the ages of our sample gcs accurately , we required that our gc sample have both independently determined spectroscopic metallicities , and reddening values .",
    "we used two homogeneous reference sources of spectroscopic metallicities , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite present metallicities of 61 gc candidates , using the keck lris and the mmt blue channel spectrographs . with the keck lris",

    "@xcite s metallicity calibration is based on six absorption - line indices measured from integrated cluster spectra , which provides an [ fe / h ] estimate accurate to about 15 per cent .",

    "one grating ( h2400b , 2400 @xmath20 mm@xmath21 ) yields a dispersion of 0.8  pixel@xmath21 and a spectral resolution of 2.5  over the range 37004500  , and the other grating ( r1200r , 1200 @xmath20 mm@xmath21 ) is characterised by a dispersion of 1.5  pixel@xmath21 and a spectral resolution of 5.1  over the range 44005600  .",
    "@xcite then calculated 12 absorption - line indices following @xcite . by comparison of the line indices with published m31 gc [ fe / h ] values from previous studies @xcite",

    "final cluster metallicities were determined from an unweighted mean of the [ fe / h ] values calculated from the ch ( g band ) , mg@xmath23 , and fe53 line strengths .",
    "we draw the reader s attention to the fact that the m31 gc metallicities thus obtained were based on the [ fe / h ] calibration of @xcite , who included only old gcs in their calibration sample .",
    "since in this paper we estimate the ages of our m31 gc sample , and find that some of them are young or of intermediate age , our age determination may be somewhat biased .",
    "however , we point out that ( i ) the main features in the m31 gc age distribution that we will derive in section(s ) 4.5 ( and 4.6 ) are similar to those derived by authors who do not rely on the @xcite metallicity calibration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  on a one - to - one basis , the ages of most of the gcs we have in common with these authors do not differ by more than @xmath24 , and ( ii ) we do not have the spectroscopic data required to quantify this effect in detail ; instead , we refer to @xcite for an in - depth discussion on this issue .    for the reddening values of the sample gcs we refer to @xcite , who determined the reddening for each individual cluster using correlations between optical and infrared colours and metallicity and by defining various `` reddening - free '' parameters using their large database of multi - colour photometry .",
    "@xcite found that the m31 and galactic gc extinction laws , and the m31 and galactic gc colour - metallicity relations are similar to each other .",
    "they then estimated the reddening to m31 objects with spectroscopic data using the relation between intrinsic optical colours and metallicity for galactic clusters . for objects without spectroscopic data , they used the relationships between the reddening - free parameters and certain intrinsic colours based on the galactic gc data .",
    "@xcite compared their results with those in the literature and confirmed that their estimated reddening values are reasonable , and quantitatively consistent with previous determinations for gcs across the entire m31 disc . in particular",
    ", @xcite showed that the distribution of reddening values as a function of position appears reasonable in that the objects with the smallest reddening are spread across the disk and halo , while the objects with the largest reddening are concentrated in the galactic disk .",
    "therefore , we adopted the reddening values from ( * ? ? ? * also p. barmby , priv .",
    "comm . ) for our gc sample .",
    "in evolutionary synthesis models , ssps are modeled by a collection of evolutionary tracks of stars with different initial masses and chemical compositions , and a set of stellar spectra at different evolutionary stages . to estimate the ages of our sample gcs we compare their seds with the updated ssp models of bc03 . bc03",
    "provide the evolution of the spectra and photometric properties of ssps for a wide range of stellar metallicities .",
    "the model set includes 26 ssp models ( both of high and low resolution ) based on the 1994 padova evolutionary tracks , 13 of which were computed using the @xcite imf assuming lower and upper mass cut - offs of @xmath25 m@xmath26 and @xmath27 m@xmath26 , respectively , while the other 13 were computed using the @xcite imf with the same mass cut - offs . in addition , bc03 provide 26 ssp models using the 2000 padova evolutionary tracks .",
    "however , as they point out , the 2000 padova models tend to produce worse agreement with observed galaxy colours .",
    "these ssp models contain 221 spectra describing the spectral evolution of ssps from @xmath28 yr to 20 gyr .",
    "the evolving spectra include the contribution of the stellar component at wavelengths from 91 to @xmath29 m . in this paper , we adopt the high - resolution ssp models computed using the 1994 padova evolutionary tracks and a @xcite imf . we note that although the current best estimate of the age of the universe is of order 13.7 gyr , the ssp models and the stellar evolutionary tracks that form their basis have been calculated for ages up to 20 gyr .",
    "it is not straightforward to correct for this discrepancy ; one would need to recalculate all stellar evolutionary tracks for all metallicities .",
    "this situation is exacerbated by the fact that ( i ) young open clusters , up to @xmath30 gyr , have been used to properly and robustly constrain the stellar evolution at younger ages , and ( ii ) at older ages the observational diagnostics are less sensitive to changes in age , resulting in significantly greater uncertainties at those ages .",
    "these are therefore issues that one needs to keep in mind in the context of physical parameters derived for the older gcs .    since our observational data are integrated luminosities through our set of filters , we convolved the bc03 ssp seds with the batc intermediate - band , broad - band @xmath15 and 2mass filter response curves to obtain synthetic optical and near - infrared photometry for comparison .",
