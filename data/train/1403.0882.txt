    "the observed distributions of galaxies and clusters today are far removed from the homogeneous picture we have of the early universe using the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ; e.g. @xcite ) , and we require large numbers of them to piece together a statistical understanding of clustering on cosmological scales .",
    "cosmological applications of large - scale clustering measurements require information about the gravitating mass distribution in the universe , which in a @xmath8cdm cosmology is strongly tied to the dark matter distribution .",
    "direct observations tell us only about the baryonic matter , from which we must infer the dark matter distribution .",
    "various tools exist for measuring the clustering signal of observed sources , such as nearest neighbour measures ( e.g. @xcite ) , counts - in - cells ( e.g. @xcite ) , correlation functions ( e.g. @xcite ) and power spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) .    due to its relative simplicity to calculate , and relation to its fourier transform ( the power spectrum ) , the two - point spatial correlation function has become a standard in quantifying cosmological structure .",
    "a means by which we can quantify the extent to which the observable and dark matter are tied using the correlation function is through the linear bias parameter @xmath9 , the ratio of the galaxy correlation function to that of the dark matter .",
    "the bias quantifies the difference in the clustering of the dark matter haloes acting solely under gravity and of galaxies inhabiting those haloes with other effects making their structure more or less diffuse .",
    "this has a heavy dependence on the galaxy masses and the epoch under consideration ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "extragalactic radio sources make useful probes of large - scale structure , being readily detectable up to high redshifts ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "being unaffected by dust extinction , radio surveys are able to provide unbiased samples of larger volumes than would be available to an optical survey .",
    "unfortunately many radio sources , particularly at higher redshifts , have very faint optical counterparts , which combines with the often extended nature of radio emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to make it difficult to optically identify and obtain redshifts for these individual sources ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    without knowing the distance to a given radio source , clustering analyses are confined to two dimensions with the angular correlation function measuring any excess of source pairs as a function of their angular separation .",
    "the broad redshift distribution typical of radio surveys can make detection of this clustering difficult as the majority of close pairs of sources are widely separated in the line of sight direction , diluting any genuine clustering signal .",
    "strong detections of this clustering signal over a range of angular separations were made possible with the advent of large area radio surveys observing to depths of a few mjy : e.g. faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ( first ; @xcite ) , the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ; @xcite ) , the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) and the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; @xcite ) .",
    "a positive correlation function is measured with high significance using these surveys extending to separations of several degrees ( see work by @xcite and @xcite with first , @xcite and @xcite with nvss , @xcite with wenss , and @xcite with sumss ) .",
    "angular clustering studies ( such as those above ) assume a power law form for the spatial correlation function ( also a common assumption for direct spatial clustering measurements ; e.g. @xcite ) , which is also preserved in angular projection @xcite . inferring the spatial clustering properties of a galaxy sample from this projected form requires a knowledge of the redshift distribution of the sample , itself subject to uncertainty in addition to that resulting from the diluted signal arising from a sample with a broad redshift distribution .",
    "photometric redshift surveys , while lacking the precision obtained from galaxy spectra necessary for a full 3d clustering analysis , provide a more accurate redshift distribution for a given sample of radio sources than assumed models or luminosity functions . furthermore , they allow a sample to be divided into redshift bins , each with a well known distribution ( given large enough numbers to account for small photometric errors ) . @xcite",
    "use a combination of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts to investigate the clustering of first radio sources to @xmath11 and provide some comparison between spatial and angular correlation function results ( with and without the precision of spectroscopic redshifts , respectively ) .",
    "however , redshift measurements are lacking at high redshift where the clustering is stronger but poorly constrained over such large areas .",
    "while sky coverage alone , with surveys such as nvss , provides the statistical power required to measure the strength of the clustering of radio sources over large scales to depths of a few mjy , the depths of similarly large - area optical surveys , spectroscopic or otherwise , do not allow for optical identification of the radio sources with any significant completeness .",
    "however , small - area surveys have been carried out at the @xmath4jy level , which also have potential uses for cosmology and large - scale structure measurements . at the @xmath4jy level",
    ", the radio population becomes less dominated by fr - i and fr - ii type active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and we observe a greater fraction of star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , the lower flux - density limit also extends the range at which we can detect agn , reaching beyond @xmath12 where the bias of radio sources is poorly understood .",
    "it is important to measure the bias of the radio sources to these high redshifts , and to know how it evolves , in order to inform cosmological experiments dependent on disentangling the observed galaxy clustering from other effects , such as cosmic magnification ( e.g. @xcite ) and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the large volume of the universe that will be opened up by the ska and its precursors may provide important information on the very largest scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the bias of a sample of faint radio sources , extending to @xmath13 where observational measurements are lacking .",
    "we use 1.4 ghz radio data from the vla - virmos deep field @xcite covering an area of 1 square degree to @xmath3 @xmath4jy , overlapping with optical photometry from the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) deep-1 field ( d1 ) and near - infrared photometry from the vista deep extragalactic observations ( video ; @xcite ) survey with a depth of @xmath14 .",
    "we overcome the signal - to - noise issue of having a far smaller sample than a wider , shallower nvss - like survey by inferring the properties of the radio sources by the combined use of the angular correlation function of @xmath15-selected video sources ( with sufficiently large numbers to keep uncertainties small ) and the angular cross - correlation of these video sources with the radio sample ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "of the 1054 5@xmath32 detections , 915 were found to have reliable ( rel @xmath33 ) counterparts in video .",
    "these are a combination of radio - loud agn , quasars and star - forming galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a circular area of 0.01  in radius is excised , centred on any sources brighter than 13.5 mag .",
    "any remaining stellar contaminants are removed from the video catalogue by the same means used in @xcite following the method of @xcite .",

    "while the nominal detection limit of @xcite is 80 @xmath4jy , with some 41 sources detected at lower flux densities down to @xmath25 60 @xmath4jy , there is still appreciable incompleteness at this limit which merits the slightly more conservative cut used in our analysis .",

    "the random catalogues themselves have been autocorrelated finding no significant deviation from zero even at extremes of angular separation where the counts are low .",
    "the variance of the correlation function , therefore , is often given by the poisson error due to the dd counts alone @xmath46    however , the errors in the correlation function depend on the @xmath47 counts beyond simple poisson variance ; adjacent bins are correlated , with each object contributing to counts across a range of separation bins .",
    "the errors are therefore calculated more rigorously using a bootstrap resampling technique @xcite whereby several data catalogues are constructed by randomly sampling ( with replacement ) the original set of objects . as such , in any given set , some sources are counted twice or more and some not at all .",

    "this partly addresses the difference between our highest - redshift result and that of @xcite or even @xcite , but not @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide severely limited constraints ( due to a 24.4 arcmin@xmath30 area ) on the clustering of @xmath96-selected sources at fainter levels ( @xmath195 ) using the moircs deep survey in the goods - north region .",
    "contrary to the shallower sample used by @xcite , they find a significant decline in @xmath68 with @xmath96-band magnitude at @xmath196 and weaker evidence of such a decline at @xmath197 .",
    "even so , there is a roughly 12@xmath32 disagreement in our results at @xmath180 , more consistent with their results at @xmath195 .",
    "we have explored possible causes for discrepancy in our results compared with the aforementioned authors .",
    "changing the range of our fits to @xmath35 to match other work and fixing the slope to 0.8 ( as is common practice where data are sparse ) , has little combined effect on the resulting correlation lengths and biases .",
    "the difference then , may lie in the redshift distributions used , which do impact the spatial clustering measures . in order to verify that our redshift distribution is robust , we have calculated @xmath68 for our data , but assuming the distribution of photometric redshifts from a similar sample taken from the deeper ultravista survey @xcite over the cosmos field , finding again that our results are not significantly altered .",
    "the redshift catalogue from @xcite includes photometry in 30 bands over the 1.62 deg@xmath30 cosmos / ultravista field , giving redshifts with a catastrophic outlier fraction of just 1.6 per cent and whilst their distribution is not identical to that of the video sources , the consistent results suggest that we may be confident in our results with these redshifts .",
    "our results show a strong evolution in the clustering and bias of faint radio sources with redshift .",
    "we also find that the more luminous subsamples are strongly biased , as would be expected if the dominant population were radio - loud agn predominantly hosted by massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while @xcite investigated the clustering of a radio sample down to 0.2 mjy , direct measurements of the clustering of radio sources below the mjy level are generally lacking in the present literature .",
    "however , some predictions for the bias of our sample may be taken indirectly from the ska design study ( skads ; @xcite ) semi - empirical simulations of extragalactic radio continuum sources .",
    "these simulations provide a catalogue of radio sources over 400 deg@xmath30 to a depth of 10 njy in 15 radio and mid - infrared bands , as well as providing @xmath96-band magnitudes and classifications of 5 different radio source types : normal star - forming galaxies , starbursts , radio - quiet agn , fr - i and fr - ii type agn .",
    "each of these source types are attributed a fixed halo mass and a bias based on these masses and the @xcite bias model .    by imposing radio luminosity cuts to our sample at @xmath198 whz@xmath23 and higher ,",
    "we effectively bias it towards agn @xcite .",
    "the increasing minimum luminosity raises the median luminosity of these subsamples , and therefore the median redshift as the highest redshift sources must be extremely luminous to reach the radio detection limit . within errors , and ignoring the imposed flattening of the skads bias prescription beyond @xmath199 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) , these ` agn - only ' results are consistent with the skads fr - ii bias with a halo mass of @xmath200@xmath201 .",
    "this suggests , in agreement with @xcite , that the typical halo mass of the more numerous fr - is ( we expect @xmath202 fr - iis in the 1  square degree that we use here ) must be in this region as well . the increasing bias with luminosity ( and therefore redshift ) ,",
    "additionally , provides observational evidence that the truncation of the agn bias models at @xmath199 in @xcite is not justified . while the reason for this plateau is to prevent an unphysical rise in the model bias beyond redshifts where it can be constrained in the literature ,",
    "we show that the bias continues to evolve to @xmath203 .",
    "to investigate this , we use a skads sample catalogue of @xmath204jy radio sources , giving a redshift distribution and proportions for each source population , comprising fr - ii and fr - i radio agn , radio - quiet quasars star - forming galaxies and starbursts . weighting the five different bias models associated with these different populations by the relative proportions ( counted directly from flags in the simulation output ) , we determine the expected bias for each of our data points shown in figure  [ biasr ] . furthermore , we show these predictions for the case where we assume the same ( higher ) halo mass for the fr - i sources as for the fr - ii sources , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "this boosts the bias as expected , particularly at the higher redshifts , consistent with our upper two redshift bins , but also exacerbates an apparent underestimate at low redshift .",
    "deviations from the skads predictions could be the result of miscalculating the proportions of agn and normal galaxies  a greater than expected fraction of agn at high - redshift would appear to increase the observed bias  but the luminosity functions used by @xcite should be well - constrained so as to alleviate this potential issue .",
    "the halo masses of the different types of galaxy , and how they evolve with redshift however , are less well known . assuming robust luminosity functions , our results would appear to suggest a less biased ( i.e. less massive ) population at low redshift and a more biased one at higher redshift , contrary to the single fixed mass model of skads . although we note that the cosmological volume sampled at low redshift is relatively small and as such we expect the clustering signal to be dominated by sample variance , which we do not consider here as we are most interested in the high - redshift measurements , whereas at low - redshift large - area surveys are more suitable .",
    "we have made use of complementary optical and infrared data from cfhtls and video to infer the spatial clustering of radio sources at the @xmath205 @xmath4jy level in a 1 square degree field ( video - xmm3 ) through the angular cross - correlation function . with a @xmath14 sample of @xmath25100,000 galaxies with reliable photometric redshifts out to @xmath16 , we find the auto - correlation function , spatial correlation length , and linear bias of the full sample and four independent redshift bins .",
    "furthermore , we use the cross - correlation of these sources with our deep radio sample of 766 galaxies to infer their bias .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the slope of @xmath35 for infrared - selected galaxies is generally consistent ( @xmath206 ) but slightly larger than the canonical value of @xmath207 often assumed in the literature .",
    "this does not significantly affect our results , and we find an increasing bias and correlation length in qualitative agreement with similar infrared studies , but with significantly weaker clustering than found elsewhere due to a better constrained redshift distribution .",
    "2 .   by cross - correlating with this background of infrared galaxies , we are able to find a robust cross - clustering signal for the radio galaxies across 4 redshift bins up to a median redshift of @xmath17 .",
    "3 .   combining the auto- and cross - correlation function results , we are able to disentangle the clustering scales of the two galaxy populations to find a radio source bias which increases from @xmath173 at @xmath208 to @xmath7 at @xmath209 .",
    "placing lower limits on radio luminosity at @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 whz@xmath23 effectively reduces the sample to agn - dominated subsample , giving a high - redshift measurement of the agn bias of @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 , respectively .",
    "the radio bias found at higher redshifts is greater than that expected by assuming the models used in the skads radio simulations .",
    "however , assigning a similar halo mass to the fr - i sources as assumed for the fr - ii sources in our radio sample largely addresses this discrepancy .",
    "indeed , results using the high - luminosity subsample appear to confirm that low - radio - luminosity agn have a typical halo mass similar to that assigned to fr - ii radio galaxies ( @xmath200 @xmath201 ) .",
