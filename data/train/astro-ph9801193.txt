    "the distribution of mass within high redshift clusters of galaxies can be a powerful test of theories of gravitational clustering , and may give clues to the nature of dark matter ( ostriker & cen 1996 , eke  1996 ) .",
    "high - resolution mass maps of clusters would place constraints on both @xmath9 and the nature of the dark matter ( crone  1994 , 1996 ; mohr  1995 ) because different scenarios for structure formation predict observably different mass clumping and segregation in clusters .",
    "however , it has not previously been possible to map the mass distribution in clusters in sufficient detail to view mergers and galaxy - cluster mass segregation .",
    "neither galaxy light nor hot gas necessarily trace the total mass distribution precisely ( see schindler & bhringer 1993 ) .",
    "although weak lensing , x - ray , and kinematic studies of clusters of galaxies set useful limits , there has not been a direct observation on scales as small as 1 kpc and @xmath10 of the mass segregation between individual galaxies and the cluster .",
    "strong lensing of a highly resolved source galaxy can provide the information required for such a reconstruction .",
    "when multiple gravitationally lensed images of a complex source occur , the mass density is strongly constrained because each feature in the source galaxy must be matched in each of the multiple images .",
    "we construct this high resolution map of the mass distribution in cl0024 + 1654 by combining a parametric mass model with a parametric source luminosity model and making a detailed match to the the hst image .",
    "qualitative comparisons of this map can be made with existing simulations .",
    "low density ( @xmath11 ) flat cosmologies , as well as @xmath12 scdm , show considerable mass subclustering on 200  @xmath1 kpc scales ( jing  1995 ) for redshifts @xmath13 .",
    "likewise , frenk  ( 1996 ) separately follow  galaxies \" , gas , and dark matter in scdm simulations and find large high contrast lumps of mass surviving to @xmath14 in virtually all cases .",
    "by contrast , simulations of open cosmologies ( @xmath15 ) have very little substructure even at redshifts of 0.5 and higher ( jing  1995 , evrard  1993 ) .",
    "simulations will soon have sufficient resolution and dynamic range to allow quantitative comparison with the data .",
    "thus , detailed mass maps of clusters at @xmath16 can help to distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "here we examine the mass distribution in the central 200 @xmath1 kpc of one such cluster .",
    "cl0024 + 1654 is an optically rich cluster of galaxies at @xmath17 with a velocity dispersion of @xmath181200  km  s@xmath19 ( dressler & gunn , 1992 ) , and an x - ray luminosity @xmath20  erg @xmath21  sec@xmath19 ( smail  1997 ) . a single background galaxy , easily recognizable because of its color and peculiar morphology , is multiply imaged ( see colley  1996 ) . after subtracting the light of the cluster galaxies , we find a total of 8 subimages of the background galaxy .",
    "we parametrize the source as 58 smooth disks of light .",
    "each of these disks is characterized by an intensity , a scale radius , and the @xmath22 position on the source plane ( 4 parameters ) .",
    "a source plane resolution of 0.007 arcsec per pixel was chosen to allow sufficient evaluations of the model to be done within a reasonable time ( 12 months ) , and to allow the model to represent almost all details of the observations .",
    "the disks are overlapping , with a median fwhm of 0.062 .",
    "further discussion of the morphology of the source galaxy can be found in tyson  ( 1997 ) .",
    "the light from this source is then ray - traced through the lens plane , and the resulting image is compared on a pixel - by - pixel basis with the hst image . in this way",
    ", we obtain a statistically meaningful estimate of the goodness - of - fit .",
    "because elliptical potentials can be unphysical ( schramm 1994 ) , we parametrize the mass distribution in cl0024 as a cluster of mass concentrations (  mascons \" ) .",
    "each mascon is based on a power law model (  pl \" , schneider et al .",
    "1993 ) for the mass density @xmath23 vs projected radius @xmath24 , with both an inner core radius and an outer cutoff radius @xmath25    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the pl model index .",
    "the constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 are related by requiring continuity at @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is proportional to the central line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",
    "we build up elliptical mass distributions by superposing a line of overlapping circular mascons . in principle , each mascon is described by 9 parameters .",
    "the first four come directly from the equation above ( @xmath30 , an inner mass core radius @xmath33 , an outer mass cutoff @xmath34 , and the slope of the mass profile @xmath28 ) . for elliptical mass distributions , there are three parameters describing the ellipticity ( the position angle @xmath35 , the length of the line of mascons @xmath36 , and the uniformity of the spacing of the mascons along the line ) . for mass components",
    "not associated with optically observed galaxies , the @xmath37 and @xmath38 positions in the lens plane are also free .",
    "the mass and linear scale sensitivity of this parametric lens inversion technique vary with position in the cluster ; cluster mascons projected near a long arc have the effect of their mass distribution highly magnified . for galaxies that are more than about 5  from the arcs , only their total mass matters , and we parametrize this by the cutoff radius ( because @xmath39 ) .",
    "galaxies farther than about 20  from the arcs are parameterized in groups . on average",
    ", we have one parameter per galaxy .",
    "however , galaxies on the arcs can typically support several free parameters each .    in practice ,",
    "one or more mascon is assigned to each of 118 cluster galaxies , with the number of free parameters for each mascon depending on the distance from the arcs .",
    "in addition , 25 free mascons were required for the remaining cluster mass .",
    "we refer to this as the `` dark matter '' [ dm ] , even though it also includes the mass of the hot x - ray gas",
    ". we will discuss the mass distribution internal to the cluster galaxies elsewhere ( dellantonio  1998 ) .",
    "two large , diffuse , mascons contain 98% of the mass not associated with the galaxies .",
    "all parameters were free in both .    in all , the mass and source models are determined by 512 parameters .",
    "however , we have over 3800 significantly nonzero ( @xmath40 ) pixels in the arcs . because the optical point spread function of the wfpc2 is smaller than one pixel ,",
    "the signal is nearly uncorrelated even on neighboring pixels ; thus , we have many more independent constraints than model parameters . in addition",
    ", pixels with no signal serve as constraints , because they prevent the model from putting flux in areas of the image where it should not .",
    "the resulting mass model is over - constrained , and is in this sense unique .",
    "the resolution of the mass model is set by the spacing of the mass components in the parametric model , and is everywhere much lower than the formal nyquist maximum resolution of two pixels .",
    "as we developed the model , it had enough power to predict the central image , based on the four major arcs , then to correctly predict the multiple subimages near the outer arcs .",
    "we measure the fit by taking boxes ( approximately 10  square ) around each of the arc images , and creating model images of each arc using the light and mass models .",
    "the image and models are then compared pixel by pixel . @xmath41 per degree of freedom",
    "is then calculated for each realization , and is iteratively optimized ( see kochanski  1998 ) .",
    "error bars were determined by bootstrap resampling ( efron , 1982 ) and simulated annealing . for the former ,",
    "the weight given to each pixel was varied randomly while allowing the parameters to vary . in the latter case",
    ", we allow the optimizer to accept increases in @xmath41 with probability @xmath42 .",
    "we ran both with the full set of parameters free , and also with subsets of 7 - 50 parameters ( chosen to capture important correlations ) free . these observed variations in parameter values determine the errors ( given as 1-@xmath43 in this letter ) , and control how many parameters may be added in a given region ; too many parameters for a galaxy creates near - degeneracies and locally large errors .",
    "our calculated errors naturally include the effects of correlations between parameters for neighboring mascons .",
    "nearby galaxies can trade mass , but the total tends to be conserved , leading to better accuracy on larger scales .",
    "the galaxy masses in the model were initialized using the faber - jackson relation .",
    "when the model evolved to a low @xmath41 , we performed robustness tests by perturbing the position and/or mass of a mascon and observing the reconvergence to the the solution . over @xmath44 models",
    "were searched to reach the solution .",
    "a color rendering of the projected total mass density , including galaxies , is given in figure 1 .",
    "optically observed galaxies are fit by small - core pl models , and are blue in the figure .",
    "in addition to the large diffuse mascons , other mascons were added to our fit to allow it to match the complexity of the cluster s mass distribution .",
    "we will discuss the properties of these small  dark \" objects in detail elsewhere ( kochanski  1998 ) .",
    "because most of these mascons represent small fluctuations in the mass density , they should generally be regarded not as distinct objects but as a representation of the local asymmetry or substructure in the mass distribution . indeed , one of the major results of this letter is that these subsidiary mascons are quite light , and hence the mass distribution is smooth .",
    "the vast majority of the mass is not associated with the galaxies , and appears as a smooth elliptical distribution ( shown in red in figure 1 ) centered near the position of the brightest galaxy and elongated in the se - nw direction .",
    "the elongation is in the same direction as that of the x - ray isophotes .",
    "it is fit by two massive superposed mass distributions ( groups of mascons ) , one with a 34  core radius and the other with a 18  core .",
    "these major mascons are centered within 2  of each other .",
    "this dm not associated with galaxies shows no evidence of infalling massive clumps : other than these two major clumps , we find no dark mascons with total mass greater than @xmath45 ( 1.5% of the cluster mass ) , out of the 25 in the fit .",
    "figure 2 shows a contour plot of this dark mass not associated with galaxies , plotted over the hst blue image .",
    "figure 3 ( _ top panel _ ) shows a color image of this diffuse dm , with the model arcs superposed for reference . the inner arc ( e )",
    "may be seen near the center .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 3 shows the diffuse light component smoothed with a 0.3   gaussian , with the hst images of the arcs superposed in color for reference .",
    "the dm has a soft core , and is not consistent with the singular mass density profiles found in cold dark matter simulations ( moore  1997 ; thomas  1997 ) .",
    "we have quantified the strongest allowable singularity in terms of adding an additional compact mascon into the fit .",
    "we sampled 20 locations for an extra mascon in the central @xmath46  kpc , which would correspond to the difference between a navarro - frenk - white ( 1997 ) [ nfw ] model and our best - fit profile .",
    "we calculated the fits , allowing correlations between these parameters , adjacent galaxies , and the main dm clumps .",
    "the largest extra mass the model would support at any of these locations has a 1-sigma upper limit of @xmath47 .",
    "the total mass profile is approximately represented by a single pl model with a central surface density @xmath48 , a @xmath49  kpc core , and a slope that is slightly shallower than an isothermal sphere ( @xmath50 ) . outside the core , the model is indistinguishable from an nfw model mass distribution with @xmath51  kpc and concentration parameter @xmath52 .",
    "however , the presence of a soft core is in disagreement with the results from recent cdm simulations . for the nfw model which matches the mass distribution outside the core , the required mean mass density inside the inner ( e ) arc s radius is 40% ( @xmath53 ) higher than observed ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "this corresponds to an extra interior mass of @xmath54 , which we can rule out at @xmath55 : the position of arc e would be perturbed by over 20 pixels .",
    "trading mass with the central galaxies also fails .",
    "the total mass enclosed inside the @xmath56  kpc radius of the arcs is @xmath57 where the dimensionless distance ratio @xmath58 contains the uncertainty in the source redshift .",
    "the source s featureless spectrum , star - forming morphology and color , and presumed  and ly@xmath59 emission lines , suggest a redshift in the range @xmath60 .",
    "measures of mass segregation and clumpiness and the morphology are independent of @xmath61 .    to allow a quantitative comparison of our results with future simulations , we have calculated a clumpiness measure for the projected mass density @xmath62 : @xmath63 ^2 d^2r,\\ ] ] as an average of the normalized density asymmetry over the lens - plane area @xmath64 , with @xmath65 measured from the centroid that produces the smallest @xmath66 .",
    "this measure is zero for two - fold symmetric mass distributions , measures the deviation from smoothness , and is unaffected by ellipticity .",
    "we calculate this statistic several ways : for mass not associated with luminous galaxies , and for the total mass distribution , smoothed on 3 scales .",
    "all the @xmath66 measures are integrated over a @xmath67  kpc radius circle centered on the cluster dm ( [ 1950 ] ra  =  00:23:56.6 , dec  =  16:53:15 ) . using gaussian smoothing with @xmath43 = 10 , 20 , and 40 h@xmath19 kpc , we find @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , respectively , for the full mass distribution .",
    "if we exclude the galaxies , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the range of @xmath66 includes uncertainties in the mass distribution , correction factors due to undersampling of the mass distribution , and a 10% variation in the radius of the circle of integration .",
    "this is a very smooth and symmetric distribution , even with the galaxies included , and the non - galaxy dm is smoother still . when comparing the results of n - body simulations with our data using equation 3 , it is important that the simulations have both sufficient resolution and enough mass elements to ensure that the simulation s poisson noise does not bias the statistic .",
    "wilson , cole , & frenk ( 1996 ) propose a mass quadrupole measure @xmath74(a ) , which may also distinguish between clusters in different cosmologies . for isodensity contours within 10% of 3820  @xmath75 pc@xmath76 ( which has area of area a  =  1.2  arcmin@xmath77 ) , we measure @xmath74(a )  =  @xmath78 , for the total mass distribution .",
    "the largest part of the range comes from the choice of contour , due to the effect of cluster galaxies near the contour .",
    "scdm simulations typically give @xmath74 values over ten times larger than this .",
    "we measure the diffuse intra - cluster light by fitting a 4-parameter luminosity model to each of the 32 brightest galaxies , with the innermost 0.5  of each excluded .",
    "a comparison between luminosity and mass profiles for galaxies will be given elsewhere ( dellantonio _ et al .",
    "the fit also includes a sky value and a 7 parameter elliptical pl model for the diffuse cluster light ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath28 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath36 , and @xmath35 ) . after subtracting the galaxy light , and excluding disks centered on fainter galaxies",
    ", we find that 15% @xmath81 3% of the cluster light inside 107  kpc radius is diffusely distributed .",
    "this diffuse light , shown in the bottom panel of figure 3 , has a core size of 7.4 , smaller than the dm core size , but the slope of the distributions are nearly identical ( @xmath82 ) . the center of the diffuse light is displaced only 3  wsw from the dm center , and 7  ssw from the total light centroid ( which is centered on the large central ellipticals ) . to examine the correlation between dm and stellar light we require rest - frame photometry .",
    "the rest - frame v light is calculated from the observed f814 ( 791 nm ) flux , since for @xmath83 the corresponding emitted wavelength is @xmath84 nm .",
    "thus , the rest - frame absolute magnitude is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath87 is the flux of an a@xmath88 star .",
    "taking @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 . within a @xmath92 kpc radius ,",
    "the rest - frame v luminosity of the cluster is @xmath93 , yielding a global rest - frame mass - to - light ratio of @xmath94 .",
    "because of luminosity evolution for @xmath95 ( kelson  1997 ) this is equivalent to a zero - redshift @xmath96 = @xmath97 .    in figure 4 we plot the radially averaged mass and light profiles for cl0024 .",
    "the diffuse component of dm represents about 83% of the mass of the cluster inside 107@xmath1 kpc , while the galaxies contribute the remaining 17% .",
    "note that , averaged in this way , the @xmath96 ratio increases 30 - 40% from 20    100 h@xmath19 kpc .",
    "the mass distribution in cl0024 is remarkably relaxed .",
    "if one assumes gaussian density fluctuations in an @xmath4 universe , the fluctuation that seeded cl0024 must have had a very large amplitude quite early ( rare ) to have become virialized by @xmath98 .",
    "one is led to consider non - gaussian fluctuations or @xmath99 . in the nfw hierarchical clustering model ,",
    "our measured characteristic mass density @xmath100 implies ( for @xmath101 ) that the 5 largest progenitors contributed 50% or more of the cluster mass by a redshift of two ( navarro 1997 ) .",
    "more generally , these observations constrain any theory of structure formation on 300 kpc scales . a key result of this first high resolution mass map is the existence of a 35  @xmath1  kpc soft core .",
    "any possible singularity must be quite small , contributing less than @xmath102 to the total mass within this core ( 10% of the mass of one of the central elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "previous weak and strong lensing studies of clusters have found evidence for soft mass cores , more compact than the x - ray derived cores ( tyson & fischer 1995 ; smail 1996 ) . because cold collisionless particles have no characteristic length scale , the soft core suggests nongravitational interactions .",
    "while hdm can produce soft cores , hdm is not consistent with the high density of dm that we find in the individual cluster galaxies .",
    "because of the relatively low x - ray luminosity ( 0.7 @xmath103 ) , it is very unlikely that this can be attributed to hot gas alone .",
    "galaxy halo stripping proceeds more rapidly at larger overdensities ( lokas 1996 ) , and the smaller core radius of the diffuse cluster light is consistent with some baryonic dissipation .",
    "this first high resolution mass map of a cluster of galaxies will be useful to compare with future n - body / gas - dynamical simulations .",
    "none of the recent simulations show evidence of a soft core , in disagreement with these observations .",
    "indeed , as the resolution of simulations increases from 100 to 30 kpc the central mass becomes more singular .",
    "higher resolution gas - dynamical simulations for various initial fluctuation spectra and values of @xmath9 will be required . comparing with current simulations , the smoothness of the dm distribution in cl0024 + 1654 favors open non - flat cosmologies .",
    "constructing high - resolution mass maps of other clusters will require considerably deeper exposures , as we took advantage of an unusual , complex , high surface brightness galaxy directly behind the cluster ."
