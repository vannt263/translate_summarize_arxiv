    "spatial structures in non - equilibrium nonlinear systems have been studied widely and successfully during the last half century@xcite .",
    "the processes of the formation of such structures are referred to as the non - equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "non - equilibrium phase transitions are various and in their majority differ from the equilibrium phase transitions . there is a class of specific non - equilibrium phase transitions in systems of particles ( or quasiparticles in crystals ) , which have finite values of the lifetime .",
    "if combining particles produces an energy gain and the lifetime of particles is much larger than the time of inter - particle collisions , the particles may form a condensed phase .",
    "the formation of drops of the electron - hole liquid in germanium or silicon with high density of excitons created by light is a classical example of the phase transitions in systems of unstable particles@xcite .",
    "the stationary state of the condensed phase of unstable particles may exist only in the presence of a source which creates new particles instead of the disappearing ones . when the value of the lifetime is large , the parameters of the condensed phase ( density , critical temperature of the phase transition etc . )",
    "are only slightly modified compared to the same parameters for the infinite value of the lifetime .",
    "but for the range of parameters , where the gas and the condensed phase coexist , the spatial distribution of the finite lifetime particles has particular features which will be discussed later .",
    "magnons in magnetic materials are the classical example of particles with the finite lifetime .",
    "the chemical potential of magnons is equal to zero in the equilibrium state because their number is not conserved due to the magnon - magnon and magnon - phonon interactions . in presence of an external pumping ,",
    "additional magnons appear besides the equilibrium magnons . as the result ,",
    "the chemical potential is not equal to zero .",
    "magnons are bose particles and when their concentration exceeds some threshold value , the appearance of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) could be expected together with its interesting manifestations : accumulation of particles at a certain level , superfluidity and so on . an interesting effect was observed in the works@xcite in which the authors investigated magnons in the yttrium - iron - garnet ( yig ) films .",
    "the magnons were excited by the parametric longitudinal pumping .",
    "the analysis of the magnon spectra was carried out using brillouin light scattering ( bls ) spectroscopy .",
    "the authors showed from the analysis of experiments the manifestation of the bose - einstein condensation of magnons .",
    "in particular , an increase of the magnon concentration in the state with the wave vector which corresponded to the minimum of the magnon band was observed@xcite .",
    "the appearance of the spontaneous coherence in bls by magnons was observed if the pumping exceeded a critical value @xcite .",
    "the emergence of the periodical variation of the magnon density at a high level of the magnon excitation was also demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the latter phenomenon was explained by the presence of two minima in the magnon dispersion law leading to the formation of two condensates and to the interaction between the condensates .    since then the investigation of the magnon condensation in yig obtained further development in numerous works which further advanced the explanation of the phenomenon observed in @xcite and suggested different other effects related to bose - einstein condensation .",
    "thus , the stability of bec in the high density magnon system in yig was analyzed in the paper @xcite .",
    "the microwave emission from the uniform mode generated by bec studied in @xcite .",
    "the spatial structure of interacting bosons with two minima in the dispersion law was investigated in the papers @xcite .",
    "the dramatic peak in the density of the proposed condensed magnons after switching off the pumping was observed in the work @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the time by the which the peak increased coincided with the time of the magnon decay and the time by the peak decreased was much larger than the magnon decay time .",
    "the problem of the spin current in the system of an isolator and a conductor was theoretically studied under the condition of bec of magnons in the isolator in @xcite . in the papers @xcite the josephson oscillations in the magnon density between two",
    "spatially separated magnon clouds were calculated and also the methods of the magnon current measurement are analyzed . in the paper",
    "@xcite the temporal decrease of the magnon condensate density in yig at the gradient of the temperature , created by a laser , after the pumping shutdown was observed .",
    "the authors explained this effect by the appearance of a supercurrent in the condition of bec .",
    "but there are works in which the doubt is expressed about the correctness of the interpretation of the results observed in @xcite .",
    "the authors of the work @xcite showed that the reason of an accumulation of particles created by pumping at the lowest state may be caused by the peculiarities of the bose - einstein condensation of quasi - particles . in the paper @xcite the authors described the time evolution of the magnon condensate under pumping by the classical stochastic landau - lifshits - gilbert equation including magnon - phonon hybridization and came to the conclusion that the phenomenon observed in @xcite has a purely classical nature .    in the current paper , we present another version of the processes in a ferromagnet with the magnon density exceeding the equilibrium value .",
    "we show that , if there are additional magnons , created by an external pumping , the evolution of the system may choose the scenario alternative to the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "this new scenario is the formation of regions in the ferromagnetic material where the magnetic moments are oriented opposite to the orientation of the magnetic moment of the sample .",
    "similar to the bose - einstein condensation , this phenomenon appears in crystals with the magnon density higher than the equilibrium value .",
    "the system of magnons is in a way equivalent to a gas of particles .",
    "if the concentration of the particles exceeds the equilibrium value , the gas is referred to as `` over - saturated '' or `` supersaturated '' .",
    "the processes of the precipitation of the regions of the new phase are known to occur in the over - saturated gas .",
    "similar systems arise also in mixtures of liquids or solids after rapid cooling .",
    "there are two popular models that describe processes of the unmixing of mixtures from one thermodynamic phase to form two coexisting phases : the model of the spinodal decomposition@xcite and the model of the nucleation and growth@xcite .",
    "the subject of our interest , the system with the magnon pumping , is `` over - saturated '' with magnons .",
    "so , during the relaxation the individual magnons would cluster forming inclusions of the new phase . within these inclusions ,",
    "the orientation of the magnetic moments would be opposite to the magnetic moment of the crystal . a qualitative picture for the dynamics of the magnon system",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "let us assume that the magnon state of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a presents the uniform quasi - equilibrium magnon distribution which arises due to both the thermal excitation and the external pumping .",
    "there are two scenarios for the further development of the uniform magnon distribution .",
    "according to the first scenario , the bose - einstein condensation shall occur if the magnon concentration exceeds the critical value .",
    "such process is investigated in the cited papers@xcite .",
    "but , the second scenario , according to which the formation of the new phase occurs in the over - saturated magnon system , is also realistic .",
    "there is a strong short - range interaction between magnons .",
    "when magnons are collected in a cluster , the energy per magnon decreases by the value of order of 0.1  ev @xcite , which significantly exceeds the thermal energy at the room temperature .",
    "the equilibrium state of the system is determined by the minimum of the free energy and not by the minimum of the energy , but , if the magnon concentration exceeds the equilibrium one , the magnon clusters have to form with the opposite orientation of their magnetic moments to the magnetic moment of the other part of the crystal .",
    "the magnon clusters are inclusions of regions of the magnon condensed phase .",
    "but it is not the bose - einstein condensation , it is the conventional condensation in the coordinate space due to the interaction between particles .",
    "the clusters of the new condensed phase may be shaped variously .",
    "a structure in the form of a single domain is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b .",
    "the presented paper investigates the processes of the formation of the regions of the new phase in the supersaturated magnon gas .    because the magnon lifetime is finite",
    ", the arising structures may exist only during the continuous magnon pumping .",
    "similar studies of the phase transitions in the systems of particles with the finite lifetimes have been carried out for different types of quasi - particles : for the radiation defects@xcite , for the excitons@xcite .",
    "the theories of these works have modified and generalized the stochastic model of the nucleation and growth ( lifshiz - slyosov @xcite ) and the model of the spinodal decomposition ( cahn - hillert @xcite ) to make them applicable to systems of particles with a finite lifetime .",
    "the theories have been successful in explaining the unconventional experimental results obtained by different authors ( mainly by the timofeevs@xcite and butovs@xcite groups ) during investigation of the light emission by excitons from the double quantum well heterostructures in semiconductors at low temperature .",
    "excitons were created by lasers and , at high density , formed islands of the excitonic condensed phase . sometimes the islands were localized periodically in the space .",
    "the references to the applications of the theory of phase transitions in systems of unstable particles to the explanation of experiments with excitons are given in @xcite .",
    "the formation of the new phase in a system of unstable particles has distinct features compared to the phase transition in the system of stable particles .",
    "the distinctions include : 1 ) the size of the regions of the new phase is restricted , 2 ) there is a correlation between the regions of the new phase , which may cause the appearance of periodical structures , 3 ) the regions of the new phase exist only at the external pumping .",
    "the structures are the results of self - organization processes in non - equilibrium systems .",
    "in the presented paper , we apply to the many - magnon system the approach developed in the above papers ( the paper @xcite and the references therein ) devoted to the study of the phase transitions in systems of unstable particles .",
    "we shall show the possibility of an appearance of the new phase inclusion in the magnetic with supersaturated magnon gas .",
    "the qualitative analysis , given in the last section , argues that effects caused by the new inclusions may be similar to the effects , which were observed in @xcite and explained by the manifestation of bec .",
    "we shall consider a nonconducting magnetic crystal in the magnetic field oriented along the crystalline axis @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the non - equilibrium magnons are excited in the system by the two - magnon longitudinal pumping and the number of magnons is larger than the equilibrium one . due to the strong magnon - magnon and magnon - phonon interactions , the magnons are in the quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "our aim consists in the determination of the spatial variation of the magnetization @xmath1 . to this end",
    ", we shall study the clustering of magnons into a new phase with the creation of regions that have the magnetic moment oriented opposite to the orientation of the main magnetization .",
    "after the creation of the regions of the new inverse phase , the magnetization is non - uniform , though the initial system and external fields ( the static magnetic field , the pumping ) are assumed to be uniform .",
    "the processes of the self - organization in the system spontaneously break the symmetry . describing the non - uniform system",
    "we assume that the principle of the local equilibrium holds . in this case , in a small vicinity of some spatial point ,",
    "the thermodynamic functions are the same functions of the local microscopic variables ( magnon density , temperature ) as in the equilibrium system .",
    "this assumption allows introduction of the free energy in non - equilibrium system .",
    "the local free energy depends on the magnon density and the magnon density depends on the spatial coordinates .",
    "the principle of the local equilibrium is conventionally used in the majority cases when considering the self - organization problems in non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "we shall use the phenomenological approach for the solution of the problem .",
    "let us analyze the phenomenological equation for the magnetization @xmath1 , solution of which will be investigated in the paper .",
    "the equation for the change of the magnetization in the unit time contains the dynamic and the relaxation parts .",
    "the relaxation terms of the landau - lifshits ( ll ) and the landau - lifshits - gilbert ( llg ) equations can not be used in our paper because they require the conservation of the magnetization .",
    "the pumping creates magnons and decreases the absolute value of the magnetization .",
    "the ll and llg equations do not describe the equilibration of the magnetization after the pumping is switched off .",
    "taking into account the processes of the establishment of the equilibrium state is important in a description of the non - equilibrium system .",
    "the equation for the evolution of the magnetization which do not require the conservation of the absolute value of the magnetization is given in the monograph of akhiezer , baryakhtar and peletminskii @xcite .",
    "but neither the equation in @xcite and nor the ll and llg equations take into account the diffusion of magnons .",
    "the diffusion processes induce spatial redistribution of magnons due to the interaction between them , which may be a reason for the formation of the new phase .",
    "the diffusion is important in the formation of the new phase at spinodal decomposition processes @xcite .",

    "we shall consider the formation of a magnetic domain with the orientation of the magnetic moments opposite to the orientation of the magnetic moment of the crystal and parallel to its easy - axis .",
    "domains of such type are simple and widespread defects in magnetics .    in the transition area , where one orientation of the magnetic moments change to another , the exchange energy increases .",
    "the transition may occur either by a rotation of the magnetic moment which preserves its absolute value or by changing the value of the moment .",
    "usually the first way dominates due to the high magnitude of the exchange interaction .",
    "but in the vicinity to the phase transition , the exchange interaction decreases and the second way is plausible ( see the textbook problem in @xcite ) . since we study the processes nearby the critical temperature , the transition between the domain and the matrix is considered by changing the value of the magnetic moment without its rotation .    in the framework of the chosen approach ,",

    "( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "but the first term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) plays the main role in the formation of non - uniform structure . using these results",
    ", we may argue that the fluctuations do not destroy the periodical structures that arise in the considered ferromagnetic system , if the magnon lifetime is much greater than the times of magnon - magnon and magnon - phonon collisions and the quasi - equilibrium state is formed in the system .",
    "we have shown that , in the system with the high density of quasi - equilibrium magnons , non - uniform structures may arise similar to the formation of inclusions of the condensed phase in a supersaturated gas or to the separation of the new phase in the crystal supersaturated with impurities . performing the calculation , we used the landau presentation of the free energy of magnons , which is valid in the vicinity to the phase transition temperature .",
    "the work explored the simplest model , namely , we considered the appearance of simple defects in the form of domains .",
    "but , in our opinion , some of the obtained results give insight into the general behavior in more complicated cases . besides the considered simplest one - dimensional structures",
    ", the system may develop other types of non - uniformities having different shapes and being restricted in all directions ( disks , balls , ellipsoids , and so on ) .",
    "what new features may be expected when more complex regions of the new phase are formed ?",
    "let us make some qualitative analysis of the possible manifestations of the development of non - uniform structures .",
    "the following list names the most important of them .    1 .",
    "the appearance of the regions of the non - uniform magnetization causes additional scattering of the electromagnetic waves .",
    "the intensity of the light scattering by clusters of magnons at some frequencies is greater than by the same number of the individually independent particles .",
    "since the non - uniform inclusions are small , the magnon levels in them will be quantized .",
    "the lowest states vary slowly in space and manifest themselves intensively in the scattering and absorption of the electromagnetic waves .",
    "the levels with small quantum numbers will display themselves most strongly .",
    "this may cause an increase in the lowest part of the scattering spectra similar to the effect observed at the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "it was shown that stationary state becomes established if the time of the pumping pulse duration is much longer that the magnon lifetime .",
    "the sizes of inclusions will growth with the increasing duration of the pulse .",
    "it will cause to the step - down of the quantized levels of magnons in the inclusions and to the shift of the scattering spectra of electromagnetic waves to the lower frequencies .",
    "the spin orientation in an inclusion of the condensed phase is determined by the strong exchange interaction . in order to change the orientation of its spin to the orientation of the matrix spins",
    ", a magnon should jump out of the inclusion , where it is bound by the strong exchange interaction .",
    "there is another mechanism of the spin relaxation in the inclusion .",
    "firstly , magnons ( light arrows in dark regions of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) are exited in the domain and then leave the inclusion .",
    "this is a two - stage process and therefore it has small probability . as the result",
    "the inclusions should live long .",
    "the stationary distributions of the number of inclusions and their sizes arise under stationary pumping . in this case",
    "the number of magnons captured by the inclusions coincides with the number of magnons , which leaves the inclusions and decay in inclusions .",
    "if the magnon pumping goes off , the sample cooling occurs more quickly than the decrease the magnon number .",
    "as the result , a some excess of magnons will exist some time in comparison with equilibrium value . because the number of magnons leaving inclusions will decrease due to the temperature decrease , the number of magnons in the inclusion will rise .",
    "later the excess of magnons drops and inclusions disappear .",
    "so , the peak of magnon number in inclusions may arise after switching off the pumping .",
    "such peak was observed during investigation of bose - einstein condensation of magnons @xcite .",
    "the regions of the condensed phase in systems supersaturated with magnons may arrange themselves into structures .",
    "these structures would form a periodical distribution of domains with parallel planes .",
    "the normal to the domain plane may be oriented either along the external magnetic field or perpendicular to the field .",
    "such picture was observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "all these effects , which may be expected due to the inclusions of the new phase , were observed in experiments @xcite , and explained as the manifestation of the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "we can not object to that attribution because our study is carried out in somewhat different conditions .",
    "the majority of experiments @xcite were carried out using the magnon excitation by pulses .",
    "our calculations studied the steady states .",
    "yet we would like to underline that , besides the bose - einstein condensation , an another scenario should be considered when studying the many - magnon systems . a search for the inclusions of the new phase and evaluation of their role in the physical processes should be performed .",
    "thus , the presented paper studied a magnetic sample with a large magnon concentration created by the external pumping . due to the long lifetimes , magnons are in the quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "it is shown that besides the bose condensation , the formation of the inclusions of new condensed magnon phase may occur similarly to the development of the condensed phase in a supersaturated gas .",
    "the exchange interaction promotes the combining the separate magnons into inclusions .",
    "the orientation of magnetic moments in each inclusion is opposite to the magnetic moment of the magnetic matrix .",
    "therefore , the inclusions may exist only in condition of the external pumping .",
    "summarizing , inclusions are dissipative structures that arise as the result of self - organization processes in non - equilibrium conditions@xcite .",
