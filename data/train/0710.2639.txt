    "ads / cft duality opens a new avenue towards a qualitative or even semi - quantitative understanding of the nonperturbative aspect of a quantum field theory @xcite @xcite . because of the isomorphism between the conformal group in four dimensions and the isometry group of @xmath2 space",
    ", it is conjectured that the a string theory formulated in @xmath3 is dual to the @xmath4 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( susy ym ) on the boundary .",
    "the latter is believed to be conformal at quantum level and the global @xmath5 symmetry of its @xmath6-charges corresponds to the isometry of @xmath7 . in particular , the low energy limit of the classical string theory",
    ", the supergravity in @xmath3 corresponds to the supersymmetric yang - mills theory at large @xmath8 and large t hooft coupling .",
    "@xmath9 various field theoretic correlation functions can be extracted from the metric fluctuations of the gravity dual and the expectation value of a wilson loop operator is related to the minimum area the loop spans in the @xmath2 bulk .",
    "notable success has been made in the application of the ads / cft duality to the physics of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created by rhic , even though the underlying dynamics of qcd is very different from that of a supersymmetric yang - mills theory @xcite . among them",
    "are the viscosity - entropy ratio @xcite , the jet quenching parameter @xcite which are closer to the observed values than the perturbative results .",
    "while it is premature to conclude that every aspect of rhic physics can be explained in terms of susy ym , the ads / cft duality provides unprecedented references since this is the only case where the strong coupling properties of a quantum field theory can be calculated reliably .",
    "the heavy quarkonium dissociation is an important signal of the formation of qgp in rhic . in the deconfinement phase of qcd",
    ", the range of the binding potential between a quark and an anti - quark is limited by the screening length in a hot and dense medium , which decreases with an increasing temperature . beyond the dissociate temperature , @xmath10 , the range of the potential is too short to hold a bound state and the heavy meson will melt .",
    "the lattice simulation of the quark - antiquark potential and the spectral density of hadronic correlators yield consistent picture of the quarkonium dissociation and the numerical values @xmath10 .",
    "it is the object of this paper to calculate @xmath10 using the heavy quark potential of @xmath4 susy ym extracted from its gravity dual @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "although the potential model applies only in the non - relativistic limit which is not the case when the t hooft coupling of the @xmath4 susy ym , @xmath11 becomes too strong , it can be justified within the lower side of the range of @xmath11 used in the literature to compare ads / cft with the rhic phenomenology , i.e. @xmath12 the upper edge is obtained by substituting into ( [ lambda ] ) @xmath13 and the qcd value of @xmath14 at rhic energy scale ( @xmath15 ) and the lower edge is based on a comparison between the heavy quark potential from lattice simulation with that from ads / cft @xcite .",
    "we model the quarkonium , @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a non - relativistic bound state of a quark and an antiquark .",
    "the wave function for their relative motion satisfies the schr dinger equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the reduced mass with @xmath18 the mass of the heavy quark and @xmath19 is the binding energy of the bound state .",
    "because of the screening of qgp , the effective potential energy has a finite range and is temperature dependent .",
    "the dissociation temperature of a particular state is the temperature at which its @xmath20 is elevated to zero .    in the next section",
    "we shall calculate the dissociation temperature semi - analytically with the heavy quark potential extracted from the vanila ads - schwarzschild metric . the case with an infrared cutoff",
    "will be examined in the section iii and the section iv will conclude the paper .",
    "the free energy of a static pair of @xmath21 separated by a distance @xmath22 at temperature @xmath23 is given @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the wilson line running in euclidean time direction at spatial coordinates @xmath26 and is closed by the periodicity .",

    "the thermal average of a single wilson line , @xmath35 , is independent of the spatial coordinates .",
    "two ansatz of the potential model have been explored in the literature@xcite : the @xmath36-ansatz which identifies @xmath37 with @xmath38 and the @xmath39-ansatz which identifies @xmath37 with @xmath40 .",
    "the lattice qcd simulation reveals that the @xmath39 ansatz produces a deeper potential well and thereby higher @xmath10 because the entropy contribution is subtracted .",

    "the threshold value of @xmath92 at the dissociation temperature , @xmath93 , is determined by the matching condition at @xmath88 , @xmath94 it follows from ( [ etadef ] ) that the dissociation temperature is given by @xmath95    it is interesting to observe that the extrapolation of the first two terms of ( [ expansion ] ) vanishes at @xmath96 which is very close to the exact zero point ( [ quote ] ) , and the third term of ( [ expansion ] ) remains small there .",
    "this suggests that the screening factor @xmath80 can be well approximated by a linear function @xmath97 with @xmath98 , as is evident from the exact profile of @xmath80 shown in fig.1a .",

    "in summary , we have calculated the dissociation temperatures of heavy quarkonium using the @xmath128 implied potential with both the vanila ads - schwarzschild metric and the one with the infrared cutoff . while estimations of @xmath10 have been made in the literature based on various holographic models @xcite @xcite , a determination of @xmath10 from the schrdinger equation within the same framework is still lacking . our work is to fill this gap . on comparing our results with that from the lattice simulation @xcite",
    ", we found that our ratios @xmath129 extracted from the modified ads - schwarzschild metric ( [ metric_yee ] ) are lower than the lattice ones within a factor of two .",
    "the difference between the f - ansatz and the u - ansatz is similar .",
    "one has to bear in mind that the matter field proportion of @xmath4 susy ym is larger than that of qcd with light quarks and the screening ought to be stronger .",
    "the stronger screening will make the heavy quarkonium more vulnerable and thereby lower the dissociation temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the potential becomes wider in the metric with the ir cutoff introduced in @xcite since some of degrees of freedom becomes massive .",
    "the authors of @xcite calculated the spectral function of the fluctuation of a d7 brane and deduced from which the meson melting temperature @xmath130 for all bound state levels .",

    "the spectral analysis of @xcite would be superior if the underlying dynamics of qgp were @xmath4 susy ym .",
    "but the higher @xmath10 s may point to its difference from qcd .",
    "also the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath10 in eq.([spectral ] ) is entirely at variance with ours .",
    "our relationship @xmath134 for the vanila ads - schwarzschild metric follows from the property that the binding strength is proportional to @xmath135 but the binding range is independent of @xmath11 . a field theoretic speculation on this property of the heavy quark potential can be found in @xcite .",
    "since we are comparing two different theories , some features may be shared by both and some properties may not .",
    "if the screening properties of the @xmath4 susy ym can be carried over to qcd , our potential model calculation inspired by the holographic principle should provide a semi - quantitative description on the quarkonium dissociation mechanism in the realistic quark - gluon plasma .",
