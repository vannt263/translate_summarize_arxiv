    "the amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) noise from optical amplifiers , e.g. , erbium doped fiber amplifiers ( edfas ) , is one of the fundamental reasons for the bit - error - rate ( ber ) in an optical fiber communication ( ofc ) system . for an ofc system with non - negligible kerr nonlinearity",
    ", the ase impact evaluation is complicated due to the nonlinear interaction between signal and ase noise . in the case of signal power",
    "much stronger than the noise power , the noise - noise beating is relatively small so that the noise field in the fiber can be approximately described by linearized noise equation ( lne ) , which was proposed separately in ref .",

    "noise propagator is a matrix used to show noise field propagation in the fiber . in the case of linear perturbation , it is independent of the specific noise realizations , which makes it possible to calculate the moment - generating function ( mgf ) of the filtered photoelectric current at the receiver @xcite-@xcite .",
    "mgf method is an approach making use of mgf to evaluate the noise impact on the system performance .",
    "now , it is well known that this method is accurate for various linear ofc systems . for nonlinear ofc systems",
    ", the mgf method can also be applied , provided their noise fields obey lne .",
    "one can see this from doob s theorem , which means that , in a linearizable system driven by gaussian - distributed noise , each of the independent random variable keeps gaussian ( cf .",
    "p. 35 of ref .",
    "thus the mgf of the received photoelectric current can be calculated as those for linear ofc systems .",
    "the common form of lne @xcite-@xcite is based on the continuous wave ( cw ) assumption , i.e. , the noise - free signal in the lne is artificially simplified as a cw wave . as a result , a semi - analytical form of noise propagator and the noise power spectral density ( psd ) , so called parametric gain ( pg ) , can be obtained .",
    "the drawback of this simplification is that the noise - free signal in this lne neglects chromatic dispersion ( cd ) effect . as a result",
    ", the couplings between noise components ( in frequency domain ) can not be taken into account .",
    "a lne beyond cw , named accurate lne in this work , was first proposed and discussed in ref .",
    "dynamically taking into account the local cd and kerr nonlinearity along the fiber , this lne provides accurate noise information , with its computational cost being much higher than the cw approach .",
    "for example , given a noise - free signal obtained from nonlinear schr@xmath0dinger equation ( nlse ) , the computation required to update the accurate lne has cubic complexity in the number of fourier components @xcite . to reduce the computational complexity , covariance matrix method ( cmm )",

    "@xcite , where the noise covariance matrix was obtained by processing large noise realizations . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the computational cost of cmm was further reduced by a deterministic approach using perturbation solution .",
    "since the raw covariance matrix obtained from nlse via monte carlo noise realizations @xcite or perturbation solution @xcite may contain nonlinear noise contribution , it needs to be separated from the nonlinearity - induced phase and timing jitter .",
    "thus , the obtained pdfs of the receiver voltage agrees well with monte carlo simulation @xcite .    with the help of linear perturbation",
    ", the noise covariance matrix can also be solved from its ordinary differential equation ( ode ) proposed by @xcite .",
