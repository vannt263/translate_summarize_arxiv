    ", the success of experimental neutrino physics has been spectacular , providing detailed information on the stellar matter processes , as well as on their intrinsic properties in vacuum @xcite .",
    "the existence of a finite neutrino mass leads to the occurrence of neutrino flavor oscillations in vacuum , as documented by experiments and observations .",
    "neutrino interactions with a dense plasma show that a significant amount of energy transfer between neutrino beams and plasma waves can take place over distances , thus suggesting that such a mechanism could be crucial for the formation of an outgoing shock in type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "such a coupling results from the existence of an induced neutrino charge @xcite , leading to collective kinetic instabilities , which are mediated by neutrino landau damping @xcite .",
    "neutrino plasma interactions could also lead to the emission of electron - positron pairs @xcite , and to the excitation of quasi - static magnetic fields @xcite . on the other hand , the interaction with matter can also significantly change the neutrino flavor oscillations , and lead to a resonant coupling between neutrino flavor states , known as the msw effect @xcite .",
    "neutrino plasma instabilities and neutrino flavor oscillations are usually considered as two distinct phenomena , and have been explored independently by two different scientific communities . here",
    "we try to establish the bridge between these two communities , by considering the influence of plasma instabilities and plasma turbulence on the neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "our approach is also motivated by recent studies of neutrino behavior in a turbulent background @xcite .    in the present work we consider the influence of plasma oscillations on the evolution of the neutrino flavor polarization vector .",
    "the influence of a space or time varying medium on the neutrino flavor content has been considered by many authors , but only a few @xcite consider sine - variations ( in time ) of the electron density , as we do here .",
    "in contrast with this previous work , which is mainly concerned with numerical solutions of the neutrino oscillation equations , we use here a wkbj - like method , which allows us to derive simple analytical solutions in which the role of higher harmonics becomes apparent .",

    "vi , we state our conclusions .",
