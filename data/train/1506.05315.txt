    "moreover , the galactic discs tend to be bluer than spheroids , with them being either elliptical galaxies or bulges of lenticular and spiral galaxies @xcite . however , photometric data alone is not enough to distinguish whether these systematic differences are an effect of age or metallicity then making impossible to drive conclusive results about the stellar populations in galaxies beyond the local group @xcite .",

    "in addition , the discs of galaxies are a reservoir of molecular gas @xcite feeding more than one single episode of star formation .",

    "galactic discs are believed to form immediately after a major merging of gas dominated systems @xcite , through an inside - out process with the inner parts forming first due to their lower angular momentum and the outer parts with higher angular momentum forming later @xcite .",
    "the inside - out scenario was confirmed by @xcite studying the disc truncations at high @xmath31 . within this framework ,",
    "age and metallicity gradients are expected to be measured across galactic discs with the older @xcite and more metal rich stars @xcite confined in the inner regions .",
    "nevertheless , this prediction is correct under the assumption that stars remain in the same region of the disc where they formed .",
    "recently it has been shown the possibility that the stellar orbits change in time and stars might move inward or outward across the disc .",
    "this effect is referred as stellar migration and it has been investigated both with a theoretical approach @xcite and using numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the process of radial migration is expected to mix the stellar populations and flatten the metallicity gradient with time .",
    "the paucity of data to address such a relevant topic makes worthwhile any effort to measure the properties of the stellar populations in galactic discs .",
    "therefore , we decided to study the stellar populations in the discs of a sample of 10 spiral galaxies for which the structural and kinematical properties of the bulge and disc were already known @xcite .",

    "measuring the stellar populations of the different galaxy components from integrated spectra suffers from contamination .",
    "the properties inferred for one component are indeed affected by those of the others depending on their relative contribution to the galaxy surface brightness .",
    "this issue is critical for bulges and bars , which are always embedded in discs and overlap one to each other at small radii , nonetheless it can be easily overcome for discs which dominate the surface brightness distribution at large radii .",
    "since we were interested in investigating the stellar populations of the disc component , we focused our analysis on the disc - dominated region between , which is the radius where the disc contributes more than @xmath32 of the galaxy surface brightness , and , which is the farthest radius where the signal - to - noise ratio is sufficient to measure the properties of the stellar populations in the available spectra ( @xmath33 per resolution element ) .    for each galaxy",

    "we analysed the galaxy spectra obtained in the radial range between and , which are the radii where the disc contributes more than @xmath32 of the galaxy surface brightness and the farthest measured radius , respectively . on average",
    "such a radial range extends out to @xmath248 times the disc scalelength @xmath249 and it is @xmath250 wide .",
    "the luminosity - weighted age  and luminosity - weighted metallicity  of the stellar populations were measured at and by fitting the galaxy spectra with a linear combination of stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the disc stellar population of the sample galaxies has a flat distribution of  ranging from @xmath251 gyr to @xmath252 gyr at both and , however we note that at only one galaxy has an age greater than @xmath253 gyr while at they are four . the luminosity - weighted metallicities span a wide range of values from solar to sub - solar ( @xmath254@xmath255 dex ) but the number distribution at  is slightly shifted towards lower metallicities and the peak moves from @xmath42 dex at at about @xmath41 dex at .",
    "the disc stellar populations of the majority of the sample galaxies are characterised by a negligible  gradient over the disc scalelength and negative  gradient , giving observational support to the inside - out formation scenario @xcite .",
    "no correlation was found between the galaxy morphological type and either  or  and between the morphological type and gradients of  and . even though the small number statistics does not allow us to trace a firm conclusion",
    ", this might suggest that the star formation in discs is not strongly connected with the galaxy type , as already pointed out for bulges .",
    "indeed @xcite and @xcite found that the evolution of bulges and discs do not have a strong interplay and they follow independent paths of star formation .",
    "most of the discs display a bimodal age distribution hosting a young ( @xmath122 gyr ) and an old ( @xmath123 gyr ) stellar population , for which we derived the value and gradient of both the luminosity - weighted age and metallicity .",
    "the old stellar component usually dominates the disc luminosity and it is slightly more metal poor than the young stellar component .",
    "the luminosity fraction of the old stellar component is almost constant within the observed radial range in half of the sample galaxies and therefore no age gradient is observed in their discs .",
    "the old and young stellar populations are characterised by negative ( @xmath196@xmath197 dex ) and slightly positive ( @xmath196@xmath198 dex ) gradients of metallicity , respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings by @xcite when rescaled to the disc effective radius .",
    "these results suggest that the discs formed out with a shallow gradient of age and metallicity , and this is consistent with the predictions of the inside - out assembly scenario @xcite",
    ". the young stellar population could be the result of a second burst of star formation due to the acquisition of gas from the environment .",
    "this give rise to the homogeneously - mixed stellar population we observe all over the disc . on the other hand , it is hard to explain the metallicity gradients of the old stellar populations in the framework of radial migration , which is expected to erase the gradients of the stellar population properties by moving stars from the inner to the outer regions of the disc @xcite .",
    "these results suggest a reduced impact of radial migration on the stellar populations properties .",
    "the overabundance of the @xmath0-elements over iron were derived at and  by comparing the measurements of line - strength indices with the predictions of ssp models .",
    "the gradients of total  enhancement calculated over the disc scalelength are systematically positive ( @xmath256}=0.10\\pm0.09 $ ] dex ) .",
    "this is a hint that the star - formation timescale is shorter in the outer regions of discs .",
    "this result is promising but it should be tested against a larger sample of galaxy discs and when the new @xmath0-enhanced synthetic population models @xcite will be released .",
