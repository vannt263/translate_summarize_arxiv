    "the coupling of photons and baryons by thompson scattering in the early universe results in gravity driven acoustic oscillations of the photon - baryon fluid .",
    "the features that appear in both the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and matter power spectra are snapshots of the phases of these oscillations at the time of decoupling , and provide important clues used to constrain a host of cosmological parameters .",
    "features in the matter power spectrum , referred to as baryon ( acoustic ) oscillations , have the potential to strongly constrain the expansion history of the universe and the nature of the dark energy .",
    "these features in the matter power spectrum induce correlations in the large - scale clustering of the igm , clusters or galaxies .",
    "indeed a large , high redshift , spectroscopic galaxy survey encompassing a million objects has been proposed @xcite as a dark energy probe , building on the successful detection ( at low redshift ) of the features in the clustering of the luminous red galaxy sample of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "key to this program is the means to localize the primordial features in the galaxy power spectra , which necessarily involves theoretical understanding of such complex issues as galaxy bias , non - linear structure evolution , and redshift space distortions .",
    "these effects can shift the observed scales of peaks and troughs in observations of the baryon oscillations , affecting the transverse and radial measurements differently .",
    "marginalizing over this uncertain scale dependence can be a large piece of the error budget of proposed surveys .",
    "inroads into modeling galaxy bias , non - linear evolution , and redshift space distortions have been made by several groups using n - body simulations @xcite , but these simulations are complex and often mask the underlying physical mechanisms . a route to understanding the sophisticated simulations is provided by an analytic tool known as the halo model @xcite .",
    "the halo model makes the assumption that all matter in the universe lives in virialized halos , and that the power spectrum of this matter can be divided up into two distinct contributions ; the 1-halo term arising from the correlation of matter with other matter existing in the same halo , and the 2-halo term quantifying the correlation of matter with matter that lives in a different halo .",
    "the halo model is extended to calculate galaxy power spectra through the introduction of a halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , that describes the number of galaxies that exist in a halo of a given mass , and their distribution inside that halo .",
    "the hod will naturally depend on the details of galaxy formation , but is not in itself a theory of galaxy formation .",
    "rather it is a description of the effects of galaxy formation on the number and distribution of the galaxies .",
    "the impact of galaxy formation on cosmological observables such as the baryon oscillation can be studied in the halo model by investigating the sensitivity of the observable to changes made to the hod .    in this paper",
    ", we employ a simple version of the analytic halo model to study the origins of scale dependence in galaxy bias .",
    "we investigate the impact of changing the hod on the observed spectra , and show that the scale dependence of the bias arises in a natural way from extending the dark matter description to a description of galaxies .",
    "specifically , in generalizing the description to an ensemble of rare tracers of the dark matter , the 1-halo and 2-halo terms in the power spectrum are shifted by different amounts .",
    "the scale dependence in the galaxy bias arises from this difference .",
    "we find that for small @xmath1 , the galaxy power spectrum is sensitive to the number of galaxies that occupy a halo , but not to their positions within the halo .",
    "we quantify the impact of redshift space distortions , which find a natural description in the halo model , and discuss the implications for large galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "we will try to understand the scale - dependence of the galaxy bias by examining a simple model .",
    "our goal is not to make precise predictions , but rather to use simple analytic approximations to help interpret the results of n - body simulations , which are much more appropriate for studying the fine details .",
    "our investigation makes use of the halo model @xcite , which assumes that all of the mass and galaxies in the universe live in virialized halos , whose clustering and number density is characterized by their mass .",
    "this model can be used to approximate the two point correlation function of the mass , and of various biased traces of the mass , such as luminous galaxies . in this framework , there are two contributions to the power spectrum : one arises from the correlation of objects that reside in the same halo ( the 1-halo term ) , and the other comes from the correlation of objects that live in separate halos ( the 2-halo term ) . for the dark matter , for example , the dimensionless power spectrum can be written @xmath2 where @xcite : @xmath3 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath4 the virial mass of the halo , @xmath5 the mean background density , @xmath6 the number density of halos of a given virial mass , and @xmath7 the halo bias @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath8 is the fourier transform of the halo profile which describes how the dark matter is spatially distributed within the halo .",
    "expressed this way , eqs .",
    "( [ dm1h ] ) and ( [ dm2h ] ) lend themselves to a fairly intuitive interpretation . in the two halo term ,",
    "the dark matter being correlated lives in widely separated halos , of different masses .",
    "for each of the two halos , the mass is multiplied by the function @xmath9 that governs its spatial distribution within a halo , weighted by the number density of halos @xmath10 with bias @xmath11 , and integrated over all possible halo masses .",
    "the one halo term is even simpler  correlating two bits of dark matter residing in the same halo .",
    "thus there are two factors of @xmath12 weighted with the number density of halos @xmath10 , and integrated over all halo masses .",
    "we can generalize this framework to compute the 1- and 2-halo terms for a galaxy population that traces the density field @xcite .",
    "we divide the galaxies into two sub - populations , centrals and satellites .",
    "the centrals will reside at the center of the host halo , while the satellites will trace the dark matter .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) sets the number of tracers in a halo of mass m. we assume there is either a central galaxy or not , and the number of satellites is poisson distributed @xcite . for our model we will use @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the heaviside function , and @xmath15 .",
    "note that the central galaxies do not trace the halo profile , and are not weighted by @xmath9 .",

    "we note that the 1- and 2-halo decomposition leads us to a new parameterization of the scale - dependent bias . in the limit where halo profiles and scale - dependent halo bias can be neglected the most natural description of the galaxy spectrum",

    "it is difficult to compare the scale dependence in this framework to other treatments of scale dependent bias ( e.g. @xcite ) where the galaxy density contrast is expanded in moments of the matter density contrast ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , etc . ) , because the matter density contrast itself has both 1-halo and 2-halo contributions , and furthermore we have not extended our analysis to the bispectrum or higher order .",
    "keeping to our philosophy of examining qualitative behavior in a simple model , we can extend these results to redshift space . the 2-point function in redshift space differs from that in real space due to two effects @xcite .",
    "the first , effective primarily on very large scales , accounts for the fact that dark matter and the galaxies that trace it have a tendency to flow toward overdensities as the structure in the universe is being assembled , enhancing the fluctuations in redshift space @xcite .",
    "the second comes into play inside virialized structures , where random motions within the halo reduce fluctuations in redshift space .",
    "these corrections impact the 1-halo and 2-halo terms .",
    "the inflow effect primarily impacts the 2-halo term while virial motions primarily affect small scales which are dominated by the 1-halo term @xcite .",
    "the boost in the observed density contrast , @xmath91 , due to instreaming is given is not highly accurate on the scales relevant to observations and higher order corrections apply .",
    "since it is our intent to gain qualitative understanding rather than quantitative accuracy we shall use the simplest form : @xmath92 .",

    "in general , when extending the model to galaxies tracing the dark matter , one should distinguish between central and satellite galaxies , since the latter have much larger virial motions and will therefore suffer more distortion in redshift space .",

    "conceptually , this term is added to account for extra clustering in redshift space induced by the bulk peculiar flow of the galaxies in one halo under the influence of the dark matter in other halos .",
    "for some purposes it is useful to average over orientations of the galaxy separations ( i.e. integrate over @xmath103 ) but in the case of studying baryon oscillations , doing so throws away valuable information .    as before we note that @xmath104 and @xmath105\\approx 1 $ ] for @xmath106 so the effect of redshift space distortions is primarily to enhance the 2-halo term  this makes the power spectrum `` more linear '' in redshift space than real space .",
