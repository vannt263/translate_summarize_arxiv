    "our analysis so far has shown the following : 1 ) we observe a discrepancy in the stacked fluxes of galaxies within aless pointings and the results from similar studies based on single - dish observations over larger fields .",
    "2 ) the discrepancy is likely driven by different sub - mm properties of galaxies ( e.g. , galaxies around smgs tend to be brighter at sub - mm wavelengths than typical field galaxies with similar nir luminosities ) .",
    "3 ) this hypothesis is confirmed by a similar discrepancy observed at 1.4ghz , even after removing galaxies individually detected at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "we therefore conclude that galaxies in the vicinity of smgs ( on sky ) tend to be brighter than those in the general field .",
    "we now investigate whether this effect is due to chance alignments ( i.e. , aless pointings cover regions of the sky that show projected overdensities of sub  mm bright galaxies ) or to physical associations ( i.e. , the sub - mm bright sources belong to physical overdensities around individually  detected aless smgs ) . from each of our galaxy samples ,",

    "<S> we study the sub - mm properties of color  selected galaxies via a stacking analysis applied for the first time to interferometric data at sub - mm wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we base our study on 344 ghz alma continuum observations of @xmath0wide fields centered on 86 sub - mm sources detected in the laboca extended _ chandra _ deep field south sub - mm survey ( less ) . </S>",
    "<S> we select various classes of galaxies ( @xmath1-selected , star - forming sbzk galaxies , extremely red objects and distant red galaxies ) according to their optical / nir fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> we find clear , @xmath2-@xmath3 detections in the stacked images of all these galaxy classes . </S>",
    "<S> we include in our stacking analysis _ </S>",
    "<S> herschel_/spire data to constrain the dust sed of these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that their dust emission is well described by a modified black body with @xmath4 k and @xmath5 and ir luminosities of @xmath6 , or implied star formation rates of 75140 yr@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with those of previous studies based on single - dish observations at 870@xmath8 m and find that our flux densities are a factor 23 higher than previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy is observed also after removing sources individually detected in aless maps . </S>",
    "<S> we report a similar discrepancy by repeating our analysis on 1.4ghz observations of the whole ecdfs . </S>",
    "<S> hence we find tentative evidence that galaxies that are associated in projected and redshift space with sub - mm bright sources are brighter than the average population . finally , we put our findings in the context of the cosmic star formation rate density as a function of redshift . </S>"
