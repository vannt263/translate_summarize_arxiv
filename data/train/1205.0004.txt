    "nevertheless , white dwarfs in this temperature range exhibiting atmospheric metal absorption have been known for nearly a century , and the prototype is still the nearest single white dwarf known , vma2 @xcite . at 4.4pc , this star exemplifies a few characteristics of the metal pollution phenomenon : it is a single star and thus not accreting from a stellar or substellar companion @xcite , its location within the local bubble and helium - dominated atmosphere @xcite precludes accretion from interstellar material , and its age of 3gyr is at odds with the persistence of metals that sink within a few myr @xcite . combined with the above facts , the abundance patterns in stars like vma2 have long suggested recent accretion from material such as that found in asteroids @xcite .    indeed , evidence is now strong that metal - polluted white dwarfs accrete from planetary debris . _",

    "thus metal - enriched white dwarfs are astrophysical traps for exoplanetary debris , acting as detectors that can yield the bulk composition of planetary building blocks that orbit intermediate mass stars .",
    "this paper re - examines in detail the inferred accretion rates at both hydrogen and helium atmosphere , cool white dwarfs with trace metals , referred to here as daz and dbz stars respectively , based on standard spectral types .",
    "as described in @xcite , an improved calculation method is used to place both classes on equal footing , and in doing so , the derived accretion rates , averaged over the recent history for the dbz stars , are found to be significantly higher than the current rates observed at the daz stars .",

    "2 the accretion rate calculations are described and examined , and  3 presents a scenario that can account for these data .",
    "implications for future observations and the nature of the destroyed and accreted planetary bodies are discussed in  3 and  4 .",
    "if a star is in a steady state between accretion and diffusion , the total mass accretion rate for heavy elements can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the mass fraction , @xmath6 the diffusion ( i.e. , sinking ) timescale for the @xmath7 heavy element , and @xmath8 is the mass of the stellar convection zone or outer atmosphere ( defined at the base of the convection zone or at rosseland optical depth 5 , whichever is deeper ; @xcite ) .",
    "the numerator on the right - hand represents the mass of a the @xmath7 element in the convective or outer layers of the star .",
    "all known metal - polluted white dwarfs exhibit the caii k line in optical spectroscopy owing to the strength of this atomic transition at this range of effective temperatures ( for this reason it is the strongest absorption feature in the sun ) .",
    "accretion rate calculations have been naturally tied to this element , and one can derive an accurate infall rate for calcium , and extrapolate to the total mass accretion rate with an appropriate correction factor , as follows    @xmath9    prior calculations assumed the infalling material was exactly solar ( i.e. , including hydrogen and helium ; @xcite ) , or 1% solar by mass ( i.e. , no hydrogen or helium ; @xcite ) ; the latter yields @xmath10 or @xmath11 depending on whether the extrapolation is made from a calcium abundance measured as [ ca / h ] or [ ca / he ] respectively @xcite .      for @xmath12k daz white dwarfs ,",
    "equation [ eqn1 ] can be applied with confidence because these stars possess tiny convection zones or none at all , and have commensurately short metal sinking timescales ( on the order of days ; @xcite ) that imply a steady state is virtually certain .",
    "rates computed in this way for warm daz stars are ongoing and _ instantaneous _ measures of the infall of a given heavy element .",
    "in contrast , for the coolest daz stars and the dbz stars in general , the assumption of a steady state is uncertain owing to larger diffusion timescales from correspondingly deeper convection zones @xcite .",
    "the dbz stars can retain atmospheric metals for timescales up to @xmath2yr , and while they can not yield instantaneous accretion rates , their sizable convection zones contain the integrated signatures of accretion ; a substantial mass of metals acquired within the last few sinking timescales .",
    "because of this , dbz stars provide a historical record of accretion and , importantly , a minimum mass for the destroyed parent body or bodies @xcite .    in order to best",
    "compare these two classes of polluted stars , @xcite calculated _ historical _ accretion rates for dbz stars ; that is , time - averaged over a single diffusion timescale , assuming a steady state .",
    "the likelihood of an infrared excess due to circumstellar dust at daz stars is correlated with ongoing , high - rate accretion , and thus a similar correlation in the dbz stars was naturally sought . while the fraction of stars with infrared excess differs between the daz and dbz white dwarfs with accretion rates above a benchmark of @xmath13gs@xmath1 @xcite , the relevant point for this study is that until recently , in terms of metal pollution alone and based on the assumption of solar calcium relative to other heavy elements , the two stellar classes appeared to have broadly similar , inferred metal accretion rates .    in",
    "what follows , the terms _ instantaneous _ and _ ongoing _ are used to refer to accretion rates for warm daz stars where a steady state is highly probable , while _ historical _ and _ time - averaged _ refer to the rates derived for dbz stars and the coolest daz stars , where an integrated approach is necessary .    , width=325 ]      assuming 0.01 solar composition by mass , extrapolated from calcium abundance , for both daz and dbz white dwarfs is not ideal , but understandable based on existing data just a couple years prior",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , a more accurate estimation of accretion rates is possible based on recent work .",
    "briefly , there are now eight stars with measured o , mg , si , ca , and fe abundances , with some of these stars exhibiting further elements such as al , ti , cr , and ni @xcite .",
    "these data demonstrate that the accreted matter in polluted white dwarfs is broadly similar to rocky material of the inner solar system .",
    "specifically , @xcite find that calcium represents , on average , close to 1:60 by mass , of all the accreted heavy elements for well - studied stars , while this same ratio is 1:62.5 for the bulk earth @xcite .",
    "these results suggest an improved metal accretion rate for dozens of stars where only calcium is detected can be made assuming it is 1.6% ( @xmath14 ) of the total mass .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] plots accretion rates calculated using equation [ eqn2 ] for 40 daz and 38 dbz stars observed with _ spitzer _",
    "irac @xcite .",
    "calcium abundances and stellar parameters come from the most recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with sinking timescales and convective envelope masses given in @xcite . comparing this plot with those published previously ,",
    "it is clear there are an increasing number of outlying dbz - type stars with inferred rates one to a few orders of magnitude above that observed at any daz star .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] re - plots these accretion rates as histograms for both atmospheric types ( ignoring dust emission ) , clearly delineating a subgroup of high values that occur exclusively for dbz stars . while galex1931@xmath150117 is currently the most extreme example of a daz star , with an instantaneous accretion rate of @xmath16gs@xmath1 @xcite , its extreme dbz - type counterpart is he0446@xmath172531 which has a time - averaged rate two orders of magnitude higher at @xmath18gs@xmath1 . figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] plot a large subset of all nearby ( pre - sdss ) metal - enriched white dwarfs , but there are additional examples of high rate dbz stars ( e.g. , figure 11 of @xcite ) , and at least 10 cases where the historical accretion rates are higher than any inferred to be ongoing at daz stars .     for each atmospheric class of polluted white dwarf .",

    "while a few of these stars exhibit additional elements beyond the five in common , the third column values represent a minimum , as the detection of further elements ( e.g. , al , ni ) may serve to increase the calculated rates . however , because most of the major terrestrial elements are detected in these stars , it is possible but unlikely their total accretion rates will change substantially . comparing the inferred rates from both methods ,",
    "there is agreement to within @xmath20dex for five of the eight stars and overall , while three are over - predicted .",
    "these over - predictions may diminish as further elements are detected in these stars , but it is more likely that the ( modest ) disagreement in the calculated accretion rates are due to real metal - to - metal abundance variations among the parent bodies now falling onto the stars as debris @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that galex1931 is the only known daz star with _",
    "optical _ detections of all the necessary metals for the table [ tbl1 ] comparison .",
    "this is because , all else being equal , the atmospheric opacity of hydrogen is significantly higher than that of helium @xcite .",
    "because of this , there is a bias against the optical detection of daz stars with modest to low amounts of pollution ( see figure 1 of @xcite for an excellent illustration of this fact ) . within the da cooling sequence ,",
    "the combination of atmospheric opacity and caii ionization fraction permits lower metal abundances and accretion rates to be detected at cooler stars .",
    "but between the two classes , the detection of metal lines in da stars is more difficult , favoring those metal - rich stars exhibiting relatively strong lines , and thus high abundances and accretion rates @xcite . _ because the bias works in the opposite direction , the lack of high rates in the daz population is real_.    another possibility is that more vigorous accretion takes place at dbz stars .",
    "however , it is difficult to conjure any scenario that physically favors higher rate accretion of planetary debris at stars with helium atmospheres .",
    "there is neither empirical nor theoretical reasoning that suggests the existence of db stars is related to anything beyond ( single ) stellar evolution : a very late thermal pulse , immediately following the asymptotic giant phase , can enrich the outer layers of a star with hydrogen - deficient material @xcite , eventually producing a helium - dominated remnant @xcite .",
    "other explanations along these lines would include that db stars tend to have planetary system architectures more efficient at asteroid perturbation , or parent bodies highly enriched in calcium , but such solutions are contrived and therefore discounted .",
    "lastly , white dwarf atmospheric models do not have substantial uncertainty in the sizes of the convective or outer envelopes , nor in the gravitational settling behavior at the bottom of these zones @xcite .",
    "however , it is feasible that there are gaps in the theoretical understanding of stellar atmospheres that may contribute to the inferred trends , e.g. , if the settling times in equation [ eqn1 ] are systematically under - predicted for db stars .",
    "this possibility is outside of the scope of this paper and not discussed further .",
    "the following sections proceed on the assumption that a planetary system forms without any foreknowledge of the ultimate stellar remnant , and that the planetary bodies within depend only on the conditions at formation and the subsequent influence of stellar evolution and mass loss on those bodies ( i.e. , only stellar radiation and dynamical changes ) .",

    "the high - resolution spectroscopic studies of @xcite and @xcite collectively surveyed approximately 530 da white dwarfs for photospheric metals , where stars more highly polluted than galex1931 would have been readily detected .",

    "that satisfy equation [ eqn3 ] for @xmath26yr , and table [ tbl2 ] values for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "also shown are resulting benchmark probabilities of detecting high states of marked durations , given the sample of 534 da stars surveyed at high resolution with keck and vlt @xcite .",
    "episodes of high rate accretion lasting tens to hundreds of years are allowed , while if the timescales approaches or exceeds @xmath30yr then the likelihood of detection at daz stars increases towards unity .",

    "[ fig3],width=325 ]    using the @xmath31 prescription @xcite for completely gaseous accretion disks , @xcite estimates that a disk composed purely of metallic gas will dissipate within @xmath32yr , for @xmath33 . while this timescale is longer than the allowed range of @xmath22 in figure [ fig3 ] , below it",
    "is shown that a reasonable choice of @xmath31 can produce both @xmath22 and @xmath34 values necessary to account for the accretion rate data .",
    "the accretion rate of a completely gaseous disk can be expressed as    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the mass of the disk and @xmath37 is the viscous timescale at a distance @xmath38 from the central star    @xmath39    the viscosity @xmath40 can be rewritten following the @xmath31 prescription @xcite and equation [ eqn5 ] becomes    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the orbital period and @xmath43 is the scale height of the disk .",
    "for an ideal , isothermal gas orbiting a star of mass @xmath44 at a distance @xmath38 , the scale height is @xcite :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the temperature of gas with mean molecular weight @xmath47 .",
    "metallic , circumstellar gas has been modeled at temperatures around 6000k in the few , well - studied stars with calcium triplet emission lines , using three independent means @xcite .",
    "gas composed of singly ionized o , mg , si , fe will have a mean particle mass @xmath48 g , and if this orbits at 0.5@xmath49 about a 0.6@xmath50 white dwarf , then @xmath51 .",
    "then the viscous timescale at this distance becomes @xmath52)yr and in the range 25 to 100yr for @xmath53 ; typically required to account for observational data in a wide variety of fully ionized disks @xcite .",
    "this viscous timescale is consistent with observations in two ways : 1 ) it is sufficiently short as to remain currently undetected at daz stars , and 2 ) for the largest , accreted metal masses in dbz star convection zones ( @xmath54 g ; @xcite ) , it implies rates up to @xmath3gs@xmath1 ( and higher for smaller @xmath38 ) .",
    "metal - rich , pure gas disks at such temperatures will be highly or fully ( singly ) ionized as their overall ionization potential will be lower than similar accretion disks of solar abundance , hydrogen - dominated material . thus , a disk of gaseous metals will be conductive , stable , and the standard @xmath31 should hold @xcite .",
    "accretion of gaseous debris via viscous dissipation with @xmath53 thus nicely accounts for the data in figure [ fig2 ] , yielding the correct range of rates and timescales dictated by figure [ fig3 ] , and is hence plausible .",
    "two recent studies have also shown that short bursts of high rate accretion are possible from disrupted asteroids at white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that , under certain conditions , gas may efficiently couple with solids and lead to the inward drift of particulate disk matter at rates greatly exceeding that of poynting - robertson forces . in this scenario ,",
    "a spike of maximal accretion occurs at the very end of a disk episode @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite show that a nova - like , accretion - driven outburst may occur during the initial phases of an asteroid disruption and disk formation .",
    "the standard @xmath31 disk model used here applies to any epoch where sufficient gas is produced , and overlaps with these other models under appropriate conditions .",
    "this section considers the efficient vaporization of significant masses of solid matter originally contained in extrasolar asteroids ; i.e. , processes able to reproduce the rates deduced in the previous sections",
    ". such gas production must be orders of magnitude more vigorous than sublimation of dust at the inner edge of a flat disk ( see  3.5 ) , as this can not produce the sufficiently high infall rates dictated by the accretion histories represented by figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the following should be considered for heuristic purposes only .",
    "one possibility is a planetesimal impinging on a pre - existing disk from the prior asteroid disruptions , as investigated in detail by @xcite . in that model ,",
    "if the incoming asteroid is less massive than the disk , its entire debris mass is reduced to gas via collisions and sputtering , while if it is more massive , then the disk mass is vaporized and the excess asteroid mass persists in solids .",
    "both cases have the potential to produce a large asteroid mass of gaseous debris and allow for the possibility that a disk of solids will remain .",
    "the metal - enriched white dwarfs g166 - 58 and pg1225@xmath17079 both appear to have dust rings with enlarged inner holes @xcite , where an impact may have destroyed the inner region solids but left the outer disk intact .",
    "a second scenario is a lone tidal disruption event .",
    "a planetesimal will be shredded on its first approach , but the fragments will simply continue along their eccentric orbits ( i.e. , none will impact the star ) , dispersed but tightly centered around the original orbit of the parent body , analogous to stellar disruptions at black holes @xcite .",
    "the pieces will be sufficiently small as to be immune to tidal gravity , but will collide at periastron on subsequent passes",
    ". such collisions will occur at high relative velocity and so can generate gas @xcite as well as dust .",
    "furthermore , solid debris will be prone to sublimation while not yet shadowed by a disk , as optically thin material is heated above 1200k within @xmath55 ( the approximate roche limit ) of a typical 15000k white dwarf .",
    "these modes of gas production will eventually abate , as eccentric motion damping reduces collisional velocities and particles become shadowed by a growing ( flat ) disk of material .",
    "the complete reduction of an asteroid into a disk will likely take many orbital periods ; e.g. , taking the 11.8yr orbital period of jupiter as a benchmark , one would expect planetesimals perturbed from orbits at similar distances from their host stars will take hundreds of years to make several passes .    the timescale for particle collisions in an optically thin disk within the roche limit of a cool white dwarf is typically shorter than poynting - robertson drag timescale by an order of magnitude ( but with a linear dependence on optical depth and particle size ; @xcite ) . in this regime , planetesimal debris generated by tidal disruption can only be reduced by collision or sublimation , at least until the disk becomes optically thick , at which point the disk evolution will be dominated by poynting - robertson drag at the inner edge , and viscous forces elsewhere @xcite .",
    "disk observations that reveal 1 ) silicate emission features in the mid - infrared @xcite and 2 ) radially coincident gas and dust at some polluted white dwarfs @xcite are consistent with a picture whereby the shattered parent body is at least partially ( if not totally ) reduced to micron - sized and smaller particles .",
    "it is therefore plausible that a significant gaseous mass will result from the initial phases of a tidal disruption event .",
    "this rapid gas accretion scenario has implications for observations of circumstellar disks and metal - polluted white dwarfs .",
    "perhaps most notably , those stars suspected to be accreting gaseous debris _ alone _ should exhibit the highest rates , and far exceed the poynting - robertson drag rates for white dwarfs .",
    "ultimately , all material falling onto the stellar surface will be in gas phase , and circumstellar disks may have 1 ) a cool outer region dominated by solids , 2 ) a narrow transition region where solids and gas coexist , and 3 ) a hot inner region where all debris is sublimated .",
    "such architecture is inferred for the dust disks found and characterized by _ spitzer _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite , and the limiting factor in their infall rates is the ( solid ) mass per unit time delivered to the edge of the sublimation zone by poynting - robertson forces @xcite . once vaporized",
    ", the model presented here predicts that gaseous accretion takes place on short timescales , but will produce very different infall rates for disks whose total mass is dominated by solids , and those dominated by gas .    based on the above , those disks detected to have spatially coincident dust and gas (",
    "six are known at present : @xcite ) are likely to be dominated by solids .",
    "critically , the best observations to date indicate that the ( calcium ) gas emission drops off sharply at the inner orbital radius where the particulate disk is modeled to terminate @xcite .",
    "these data are consistent with the rapid depletion of a completely gaseous inner region , resulting in a relatively low surface density , a corresponding lack of detected emission , and are compatible with the model presented here .",
    "notably , observations reveal that white dwarfs with detectable dust disks have , on average , the highest ongoing accretion rates .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] plots a histogram of metal accretion rates for daz stars with and without infrared excesses from circumstellar disks . while essentially no stars exceed the range of infall rates expected for poynting@xmath56-robertson drag , the stars without obvious dust are the slowest accretors .",
    "many of the daz without infrared excess are sufficiently warm that they must be accreting unseen material ; either gaseous or tenuous dust disks @xcite .",
    "the picture presented here predicts these stars are indeed accreting from undetected particulate disks , rather than purely gaseous matter , but it is also plausible that @xmath31 varies substantially between gas disks @xcite .",
    "more sensitive infrared observations can test this prediction .",
    "detailed spectroscopy of dbz white dwarfs has the potential to constrain the frequency of events that produce significant masses of gaseous debris , or distinct pollution events more generally . for a given baseline of exo - chondritic or -terrestrial compositions ,",
    "the heaviest elements such as iron and nickel should be under - abundant in dbz stars if the timescale for major asteroid incursions is longer than the lifetime of photospheric metals .",
    "to date there is a mix of observational results : there appear to be two white dwarfs polluted by intrinsically iron - poor material @xcite , while most iron - deficient stars are consistent with gravitational settling @xcite .",
    "analysis of a large number of dbz ( and very cool daz ) stars is needed to better understand these abundance patterns , as it remains possible that extrasolar , solid planetary material can be distinct from that contained in any known ( or modeled ) rocky bodies .",
    "but it is plausible that certain abundance patterns can only be maintained if discrete , substantial pollution events occur on timescales shorter than the heavy element lifetimes in typical dbz stars .",
    "it is noteworthy that the toy model of high and low accretion states , which is certainly an approximation of reality , underscores the quasi - steady state accretion model recently outlined by @xcite . in that model",
    ", the heavy element abundances observed in the atmospheres of dbz - type white dwarfs may differ substantially from both the steady state and early phase models @xcite . under certain conditions",
    ", parent body chemical abundances can be uncertain by a factor of two in mass .",
    "the results presented here constrain @xmath57 , but not @xmath58 in equation 10 of @xcite .    . the dashed and dotted histograms show stars with and without an infrared excess , respectively . among 19 stars with @xmath59k and where ongoing accretion is highly probable ,",
    "11 stars accreting from dust disks have an average infall rate more than three times higher than eight stars that lack infrared excesses . if these latter stars accrete from gas - dominated circumstellar disks @xcite , the difference in inferred accretion rates would be contrary to the predictions made here , which suggest that pure gas disks achieve the highest accretion rates , whereas solid - dominated disks are limited by poynting - robertson forces @xcite .",
    "[ fig4],width=325 ]      an important consequence of the proposed scenario is the necessary mass ( in gaseous heavy elements ) delivered during the high state accretion episodes , and specifically the total mass accreted within @xmath22 so that its signature is still visible today among the dbz population .",
    "the required mass depends on the choice of constants in equation [ eqn3 ] , but for @xmath60myr a mass of @xmath61 g will reproduce the average dbz accretion rates , for @xmath28 equal to the average daz rate ; this solution is represented by solid line in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "if instead the diffusion timescale for the dbz stars is taken to be @xmath32yr or smaller ( as for gd362 and ton345 ) , then the necessary mass decreases to the order @xmath62 g .",
    "if a second planetary body is perturbed to collide with a pre - existing disk system , then the gaseous debris mass needed to satisfy the above criteria is about that of vesta , conservatively speaking .",
    "the largest asteroids in the solar system  ceres , vesta , and pallas  are best described as intact planetary embryos , and while their sizes and masses are exceptional even among the largest objects in the main belt members , such masses may be more commonplace among planetesimals formed at the intermediate mass , a- and f - type progenitors of typical , extant white dwarfs .",
    "if the entire mass is not converted to gas when a second body impacts a disk , and remaining material is gradually delivered to the star in a particulate disk , then a vesta analog represents the minimum mass necessary to account for the data .    in the case where singular events are the cause of metal - enriched white dwarfs , and substantial gas mass",
    "is only produced immediately following a tidal disruption , the parent bodies must be larger still . again for the criteria above , one needs 10% of a @xmath54 g or 1% of a @xmath63 g parent body to be accreted within a 100yr period , as gas , with the remaining mass gradually delivered to the star in a particulate disk , at the rates observed for the daz stars . here",
    "the parent bodies would be at least massive as ceres , and perhaps as large as pluto .",
    "also , the particulate disk lifetimes necessary to accrete the remaining mass at more modest rates exceed @xmath64yr . neither of these predictions is a priori unreasonable , and further observations and modeling may help to constrain these quantities .",
    "the rapid infall of gaseous debris at white dwarfs can account for the difference between the currently observed and ongoing metal accretion rates at daz stars and the time - averaged , historical rates inferred for the dbz stars .",
    "the data constrain the lifetime of the necessary , high - rate accretion episodes to be strictly less than 10@xmath65yr , and gas disk models with @xmath66 can achieve rates approaching or exceeding 10@xmath67gs@xmath1 ; sufficient to consume vesta in 10yr .",
    "the several hundred da white dwarfs surveyed for metals suggest that the high - rate accretion timescale is likely less than @xmath30yr , while a search of @xmath68 da stars is necessary to confidently detect one in a high state that lasts @xmath69yr .",

    "<S> the difference between the ongoing , instantaneous accretion rates witnessed at daz white dwarfs , which often exceed @xmath0gs@xmath1 , and those inferred over the past @xmath2yr for the dbz stars can be a few orders of magnitude , and therefore must result from high - rate episodes of tens to hundreds of years so they remain undetected to date . </S>",
    "<S> this paper explores the likelihood that such brief , intense accretion episodes of gas - phase material can account for existing data . for reasonable assumptions about the circumstellar gas , </S>",
    "<S> accretion rates approaching or exceeding @xmath3gs@xmath1 are possible , similar to rates observed in quiescent cataclysmic variables , and potentially detectable with future x - ray missions or wide - field monitoring facilities . </S>",
    "<S> gaseous debris that is prone to such rapid accretion may be abundant immediately following a tidal disruption event via collisions and sublimation , or if additional bodies impinge upon an extant disk . </S>",
    "<S> particulate disk matter accretes at or near the poynting - robertson drag rate for long periods between gas - producing events , consistent with rates inferred for dusty daz white dwarfs . in this picture , </S>",
    "<S> warm daz stars without infrared excesses have rates consistent with accretion from particulate disks that remain undetected . </S>",
    "<S> this overall picture has implications for quasi - steady state models of accretion and the derived chemical composition of asteroidal debris in dbz white dwarfs .    </S>",
