    "recently , the analysis of a well of data provided by the planck satellite @xcite strengthened still further our confidence in the , so - called , lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) model .",
    "thus far , it constitutes the most promising cosmological model in the market because , notwithstanding its simplicity , it fits rather well most observational data . by assuming a spatially flat , homogeneous , and isotropic universe , of which the main sources of gravity at present are pressureless matter ( baryonic plus dark ) and the energy of the quantum vacuum ( the vacuum pressure is related to the latter by @xmath5 ) , it successfully describes , with just six free parameters , the evolution of our universe up to the present era of accelerated expansion .",
    "+ a crucial quantity in models based on einstein gravity aimed at accounting for the current accelerated phase of expansion is the equation of state ( eos ) of dark energy ( de ) , the ratio @xmath6 of the pressure to the density of dark energy .",
    "the latter drives the acceleration thanks to its highly negative pressure , @xmath7 . in the case of the @xmath4cdm model ,",
    "this agent is nothing but the energy of the vacuum whence the corresponding eos parameter is just @xmath8 . in spite of the success of this model , recent model - independent measurements of @xmath1 seem to favor a slightly more negative eos ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , which , if confirmed , would invalidate the model .",
    "in particular , the planck mission yields @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "et al . _ , using supernovae type ia ( sn ia ) data from the pan - starrs1 medium deep survey in the redshift interval @xmath10 found @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath0 at @xmath12 confidence level @xcite . however , they caution that it is unclear whether the tension with the @xmath4cdm value arises from new physics or a conjunction of chance and hidden systematics .",
    "similarly , cheng _",
    "obtained @xmath13 ( @xmath0 at @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "likewise , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , using geometrical data from sn ia , baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) , and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , determined @xmath15 at @xmath16 level .",
    "they conclude that , at @xmath17 , either the supernova legacy survey @xcite and panoramic telescope and rapid response system data @xcite contain unknown systematics or the hubble constant is lower than @xmath18 km / s / mpc , or else , @xmath19 .",
    "+ the simplest way to achieve @xmath0 in a manner consistent with general relativity is to assume that the dark energy corresponds to some or other scalar field , called a  phantom field , \" that violates the dominant energy condition by allowing its kinetic term to have the ",
    "wrong \" sign @xcite .",
    "thus , its energy density and pressure are given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ; thereby , its eos obeys @xmath22 .",
    "+ while this kind of fields shows compatibility with observational data -see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite- and constitutes a serious contender of the @xmath4cdm model , its blatant violation of the said energy condition entails serious problems on the theoretical side . since their energy density is not bounded from below these fields suffer from instabilities at the classical and quantum levels @xcite and other maladies @xcite that cast doubts about their very existence .",
    "nevertheless , observationally , they can not be discarded .",
    "then , it is natural to wonder whether an effective eos less than @xmath23 can be accomplished without resorting to phantom fields .",
    "the target of this paper is to explore whether the combined effect of the pressure of the quantum vacuum , @xmath24 , and the negative creation pressure of particles from the gravitational field of the expanding universe acting on the vacuum can achieve this . in this new scenario ,",
    "the effective eos comes to be @xmath25 , where @xmath3 is the eos related to the creation pressure .",
    "if the answer is in the affirmative , then the need to recourse to phantom fields will weaken . + this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section briefly sums up the phenomenological basis of particle creation in expanding homogeneous and isotropic , spatially flat , universes .",
    "section [ sec : scenario ] proposes three different phenomenological expressions for the particle production rate .",
    "section [ sec : data ] specifies the various sets of data and the statistical analysis employed to constrain the models .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : comparison ] briefly explores whether coupled models of de may give rise to effective eos of phantom type .",
    "the concluding section summarizes and gives comments on our findings . as usual , a subindex zero attached to any quantity means that it must be evaluated at present time .",
    "as investigated by parker and collaborators @xcite , the material content of the universe may have had its origin in the continuous creation of radiation and matter from the gravitational field of the expanding cosmos acting on the quantum vacuum , regardless of the relativistic theory of gravity assumed . in this picture , the produced particles draw their mass , momentum and energy from the time - evolving gravitational background which acts as a  pump \" converting curvature into particles . + prigogine @xcite studied how to insert the creation of matter consistently in einstein s field equations .",
    "this was achieved by introducing in the usual balance equation for the number density of particles , @xmath26 , a source term on the right - hand side to account for production of particles , namely , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the matter fluid 4-velocity normalized so that @xmath29 and @xmath30 denotes the particle production rate .",
    "the latter quantity essentially vanishes in the radiation - dominated era ( not to be considered in this paper ) since , according to parker s theorem , the production of particles is strongly suppressed in that era @xcite .",
    "the above equation , when combined with the second law of thermodynamics naturally leads to the appearance of a negative pressure directly associated to the rate @xmath30 , the creation pressure @xmath31 , which adds to the other pressures ( i.e. , of radiation , baryons , dark matter , and vacuum pressure ) in the total stress - energy tensor .",
    "these results were subsequently discussed and generalized in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite by means of a covariant formalism and further confirmed using relativistic kinetic theory @xcite . +    since the entropy flux vector of matter",
    ", @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the entropy per particle , must fulfill the second law of thermodynamics @xmath34 , the constraint @xmath35 readily follows .",
    "+ for a homogeneous and isotropic universe , with scale factor @xmath36 , in which there is an adiabatic process of particle production from the quantum vacuum , it is easily found that @xcite @xmath37 therefore , being @xmath31 negative it can help drive the era of accelerated cosmic expansion we are witnessing today . here",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the energy density and pressure , respectively , of the corresponding fluid ; @xmath40 is the hubble factor ; and , as usual , an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmic time .",
    "since the production of ordinary particles is much limited by the tight constraints imposed by local gravity measurements @xcite , and radiation has a negligible impact on the recent cosmic dynamics , for the sake of simplicity , we will assume that the produced particles are just dark matter particles .",
    "let us consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe dominated by pressureless matter , baryonic plus dark matter ( dm ) , and the energy of the quantum vacuum ( the latter with eos @xmath5 ) in which a process of dm creation from the gravitational field , governed by @xmath41 is taking place . in writing the last equation , we used eq .",
    "( [ eq : nbalance ] ) specialized to dm particles and the fact that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 stands for the rest mass of a typical dm particle . since baryons are neither created nor destroyed , their corresponding energy density obeys @xmath44 . on their part ,",
    "the energy of the vacuum does not vary with expansion , hence @xmath45 .",
    "+ in this scenario , the total pressure is @xmath46 , and thereby the effective eos is just the sum of the eos of vacuum plus that due to the creation pressure , @xmath47 since , by the second law , @xmath30 is positive semidefinite , we have that the effective eos can be less than @xmath23 without the need of invoking scalar fields with the wrong sign for the kinetic term .",
    "therefore , thanks to the combined effect of the vacuum and creation pressures one can hope to get rid of phantom fields and of the severe drawbacks inherent to them .",
    "+ the friedmann equation for this scenario is @xmath48 to go ahead , an expression for the rate @xmath30 is needed .",
    "however , the latter can not be ascertained before the nature of dark matter particles be discovered .",
    "thus , in the meantime , we must make ourselves content with phenomenological expressions of @xmath30 . here , on grounds of simplicity ,",
    "we assume three phenomenological anstze , namely , @xmath49 @xmath50 \\qquad { \\rm ( model \\ , ii)},\\ ] ] and @xmath51 \\qquad { \\rm ( model \\ , iii ) } , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 is a constant parameter satisfying @xmath53 .",

    "<S> recent determinations of the equation of state of dark energy hint that this may well be of the phantom type , i.e. , @xmath0 . if confirmed by future experiments , this would strongly point to the existence of fields that violate the dominant energy condition , which are known to present serious theoretical difficulties . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents an alternative to this possibility , namely , that the measured equation of state , @xmath1 , is in reality an effective one , the equation of state of the quantum vacuum , @xmath2 , plus the negative equation of state , @xmath3 , associated to the production of particles by the gravitational field acting on the vacuum . to illustrate this , </S>",
    "<S> three phenomenological models are proposed and constrained with recent observational data . </S>"
