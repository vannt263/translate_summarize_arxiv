    "both asymmetries are zero .",
    "therefore the smaller @xmath3he components ( except the @xmath131-wave ) are significant in pwia and change the asymmetry in the proton case . thereby the @xmath130-contribution is more important than the @xmath129-wave piece .",

    "if in the @xmath223 subsystem only the spin @xmath222 were active , the photon would couple to the 100  % polarized proton .",

    "this is valid for the both asymmetries . in the case of neutron emission",
    "the situation is different and the full dynamics , especially for @xmath117 is required .",
    "it is only in the case of @xmath116 that at the highest neutron energies all curves coincide .    as pointed out before @xcite that means that the extraction of @xmath224 from a measurement of the parallel asymmetry @xmath116 seems to be quite model independent",
    "this is not the case for the extraction of @xmath225 from a measurement of the perpendicular asymmetry @xmath117 , which shows more sensitivity to different dynamical ingredients ( see fig  [ aperp.full.npp ] ) . to minimize the effects from complicated dynamics ,",
    "measurements are performed on top of the quasi - elastic peak .",

    "such a measurement on @xmath3he would verify our knowledge about this nucleus and help set a limit on medium corrections of the form factors .",
    "the situation for the @xmath1 reaction is more complicated since the simplest pwia approximation is not valid . for the proton emission",

    "this is in agreement with the results of a study performed in @xcite .",
    "we find , however , that no picture of electron scattering on a polarized proton arises .",
    "the reason is that even at the highest proton energies partial waves with spin @xmath222 and @xmath19 contribute .    for the @xmath2 reaction we see again ( see @xcite ) different sensitivities of the @xmath116 and @xmath117 asymmetries to the dynamical ingredients of our faddeev framework .",
