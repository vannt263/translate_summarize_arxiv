    "as the extension of our analysis to systems larger than the ( 3,3 ) tube is beyond reach , we design an effective - mass theory to draw conclusions about trends in the armchair tube family , in agreement with first - principles findings . we solve the minimal bethe - salpeter equation for the massless energy bands @xmath37 ( fig .",

    "this gap is reminescent of the exciton binding energy , since in the ground state all electrons and holes are bound , so one needs to ionize an exciton - like collective state to create a free electron - hole pair .",

    "the observed@xcite many - body gap of armchair tubes was attributed to the mott insulating state .",
    "the system was modeled as a strongly interacting luttinger liquid with a gap enforced by short - range interactions@xcite , whereas the long tail of the interaction was cut off at an extrinsic , setup - dependent length@xcite .",
    "this model thus neglects the crucial effect of long - range interaction , which was highlighted in fig .  1 : were any cutoff length smaller than the intrinsic exciton length , which is micrometric and scales with @xmath41 , excitons could not bind .",
    "armchair carbon nanotubes are regarded as quintessential realizations of the luttinger liquid , since their low - energy properties are mapped into those of two - leg ladders@xcite .",
    "we remark that : ( i ) this mapping is exact for short - range interactions only ; ( ii ) among e - h pair collective modes with total momentum @xmath90 , luttinger liquid theory routinely describes plasmons@xcite but not excitons .",

    "the ei order parameter is suppressed at high temperature ( fig .",
    "5c ) and strong magnetic field ( fig .",
    "6c ) ; the mott gap is likely independent of both fields ( the aharonov - bohm phase does not affect hubbard - like coulomb integrals ) .",
    "importantly , the ei gap is very sensitive to the dielectric environment@xcite , whereas the mott gap is not .",
    "this could explain the dramatic variation of narrow transport gaps of suspended tubes submerged in different liquid dielectrics@xcite .",
    "we anticipate that armchair tubes exhibit an optical absorption spectrum in the thz range dominated by excitons , which provides an independent test of the ei phase .",
    "furthermore , we predict they behave as ` chiral electronic ferroelectrics ' , displaying a permanent electric polarization @xmath97 of purely electronic origin@xcite , whereas conventional ferroelectricity originates from ionic displacements . in fact , the volume average of @xmath97 is zero but its circuitation along the tube circumference is finite .",
    "therefore , a suitable time - dependent field excites the ferroelectric resonance@xcite associated with the oscillation of @xmath97 .",
    "the special symmetry of armchair tubes@xcite is expected to protect this collective ( goldstone ) mode of oscillating electric dipoles from phase - locking mechanisms .",
    "the resulting soft mode  a displacement current along the tube circumference  is a manifestation of the long - debated@xcite exciton superfluidity .    in conclusion",
    ", our calculations demonstrated that an isolated armchair carbon nanotube at charge neutrality is an excitonic insulator , owing to the strong e - h binding in quasi-1d , and the almost unscreened long - range interactions .",
    "the emergence of this exotic state of matter , predicted fifty years ago , does not fit the commonplace of carbon nanotubes as luttinger liquids .",
    "our first - principles calculations provide tests to discriminate between the excitonic insulator and the luttinger liquid at strong coupling , the mott insulator state .",

    "<S> long ago walter kohn speculated that grey tin  a zero - gap semiconductor  could be unstable against the tendency of mutually attracting electrons and holes to form bound pairs , the excitons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> being neutral bosoniclike particles , the excitons would spontaneously occupy the same macroscopic wave function , resulting in a reconstructed insulating ground state with a broken symmetry inherited from the exciton character@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this ` excitonic insulator ' ( ei ) would share intriguing similarities with the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superconductor ground state@xcite , the excitons  akin to cooper pairs  forming only below a critical temperature and collectively enforcing a quasiparticle gap . </S>",
    "<S> the ei was intensively sought after in systems as diverse as mixed - valence semiconductors and semimetals@xcite , transition metal chalcogenides@xcite , unconventional ferroelectrics@xcite , and , noticeably , semiconductor bilayers in the presence of a strong magnetic field that quenches the kinetic energy of electrons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other candidates include graphene@xcite and related two dimensional structures@xcite , where the underscreened coulomb interactions might reach the critical coupling strength stabilizing the ei . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the observation of the ei remains elusive .    </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on zero - gap carbon nanotubes , rolled cylinders of graphene whose low - energy electrons are one - dimensional massless particles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the armchair family , because symmetry prevents their gap from opening as an effect of curvature or bending@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that these tubes may be promising candidates for the ei , because they exhibit strong excitonic effects due to ineffective dielectric screening and enhanced interactions , both resulting from the reduced dimensionality@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as single tubes can be suspended to suppress the effects of disorder and screening by the nearby substrate or gates@xcite , the field lines of coulomb attraction between electron and hole mainly lie unscreened in the vacuum ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the interaction is truly _ long - ranged _ and in principle able of binding electron - hole pairs close to the dirac point in momentum space </S>",
    "<S> . if the binding energy is finite , then the ground state ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) is unstable against the spontaneous generation of excitons having negative excitation energy , @xmath0 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the analogue of the cooper instability that heralds the transition to the superconducting state  the excitons replacing the cooper pairs .    </S>",

    "<S> , the excitation energy @xmath1 of an e - h pair is positive ( * c * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the long - range interaction may bind e - h pairs close to the dirac point in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> if an exciton forms , then its excitation energy @xmath1 is negative . </S>",
    "<S> this instability leads to the reconstruction of the ground state into an excitonic insulator . </S>",

    "<S> the problem is challenging , because the key quantities controlling this phenomenon  energy band differences and exciton binding energies  </S>",
    "<S> involve many - body corrections beyond density functional theory that are of the order of a few mev , which is close to the limits of currently available methods . in turn , </S>",
    "<S> such weak exciton binding reflects in the extreme spatial extension of the exciton wave function , hence its localization in reciprocal space requires very high sampling accuracy . to address these problems , </S>",
    "<S> we perform state - of - the - art many - body perturbation theory calculations within the @xmath2 and bethe - salpeter schemes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that bound excitons exist in the ( 3,3 ) tube with finite negative excitation energies . </S>",
    "<S> we then perform unbiased quantum monte carlo simulations@xcite to prove that the reconstructed ground state is the ei , its signature being the broken symmetry between inequivalent carbon sublattices  reminescent of the exciton polarization . finally , to investigate the trend with the size of the system , which is not yet in reach of first - principles calculations , we introduce an effective - mass model , which shows that both ei gap and critical temperature fall in the mev range and scale with the inverse of the tube radius . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are in contrast with the widespread belief that electrons in undoped armchair tubes form a mott insulator  a strongly correlated luttinger liquid@xcite . </S>",
