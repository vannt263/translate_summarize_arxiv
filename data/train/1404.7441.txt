    "mass loss during the main - sequence phase , possibly aided by episodic mass ejection during the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stage and/or roche - lobe overflow in close binary systems , strips off the star s h - rich outer layers .",
    "this mass loss , plus mixing from the interior , helps to reveal enhanced he and n ( the products of cno h - burning ) at the surface .",
    "such a star is identified spectroscopically as a wn - type wr .",
    "if the star has sufficiently high mass , then additional evolution , mass loss , and mixing will lead to a wc - type wr , with enhanced c and o ( the products of he - burning ) .",
    "further evolution may lead to one of the very rare wo - type wrs .",
    "the spectra of wrs are characterized by broad , strong emission lines as these lines are formed in an extended , expanding atmosphere / stellar wind ; if absorption is present in the spectrum , it is usually ( but not always ) due to a close ob companion .",
    "reviews are provided by maeder & conti ( 1994 ) , crowther ( 2008 ) and massey ( 2013 ) , among others .",
    "the relative number of wn- and wc - type wrs as a function of metallicity has long been used as a key diagnostic of massive star evolutionary models .",
    "main - sequence mass - loss rates are larger at higher metallicities , as they are driven by radiation pressure acting on highly ionized metal ions .",
    "( the metallicity - dependence of wind - driven mass loss was first offered as an explanation for the changing wc to wn number ratio by vanbeveren & conti 1980 . )",
    "the conventional wisdom has long been that while single - star evolutionary models do a good job of matching the wc / wn ratio at lower metallicities ( such as those found in the magellanic clouds ) , they fail at the higher metallicities characteristic of the center of m33 , which has a metallicity that is approximately solar , and m31 , which has a metallicity that is approximately @xmath1 solar .",
    "examples of this are shown by massey & johnson ( 1998 ) , meynet & maeder ( 2005 ) , and most recently by neugent et al .",
    "( 2012a ) .    the linchpins for such comparisons at lower metallicities are the magellanic clouds .",
    "they are the nearest star - forming galaxies to our own , and studies over the years have identified 139 wrs in the lmc ( 134 stars listed in the breysacher et al .",
    "1999 catalog [ bat99 ] plus 7 wrs subsequently discovered by various studies , minus 2 that have been demoted to of - type ; see table 3 of neugent et al .",

    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "for years it has been commonly accepted that these numbers are _ essentially _ complete .",
    "for instance , in their report of discovering two wrs in the lmc , howarth & walborn ( 2012 ) suggested that perhaps as many as a dozen or so weak - lined wnes ( 10% of the lmc s total wr population ) remained to be found , but no more .",
    "however , even before the howarth & walborn ( 2012 ) paper appeared in print , neugent et al .",
    "( 2012b ) announced the discovery of a very strong - lined wo - type wr in the lmc .",
    "similarly , massey & duffy ( 2001 ) concluded that the completeness of their survey for wrs in the smc could not ",
    "preclude a wr star ( or two ) [ from ] having been overlooked , \" a statement that proved prescient , as another smc wn star was chanced upon within a year ( massey et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "these discoveries were unsettling , and forced us to examine how we came to know the wr content of the magellanic clouds , and what would be involved in conducting a more thorough survey , particularly in the lmc where the number of wr stars is large enough to provide robust statistics .",
    "some of the discoveries of wrs in the clouds came about as part of general spectroscopy , while others came about as a result of directed objective prism searches .",
    "of the 158  brightest stars \" in the magellanic clouds , 15 were classified as wr type ( feast et al .",
    "1960 ) through various spectroscopic surveys .",
    "an objective prism survey of the lmc aimed at finding wrs by westerlund & rodgers ( 1959 ) resulted in the identification of 50 wrs , 30 of which were in common with those known from the hd catalog .",
    "( see also westerlund & smith 1964 . )",
    "deeper and more complete surveys for wrs in the magellanic clouds were carried out by azzopardi & breysacher ( 1979a , 1979b , 1980 ) .",
    "their surveys employed an objective prism in combination with an interference filter that isolated the region around c  iii @xmath2 and he  ii @xmath3 ( the two strongest optical emission lines in the spectra of wc- and wn - type wrs , respectively ) in order to reduce problems with crowding and sky background that would have occurred with the use of the objective prism by itself .",
    "these studies added 4 additional wrs to the 4 that were previously known in the smc ( breysacher & westerlund 1978 ) , and 17 additional wrs to the 80 known in the lmc ( fehrenbach et al .",
    "it is worth noting that _ all _ of the new wrs found by azzopardi & breysacher ( 1979a , 1979b , 1980 ) were of wn type .",
    "indeed , the difficulty in identifying unbiased samples of wrs has been described by massey & johnson ( 1998 ) : the strongest optical line in wc stars ( typically c iii @xmath4 ) is about 4@xmath5 stronger ( on average ) than that found in wn stars ( he  ii @xmath64686 ) .",
    "the weakest - lined wn stars have he  ii @xmath3 equivalent widths of just @xmath710   , in contrast to the @xmath750    equivalent widths found in the weakest - lined wcs ( see , e.g. , fig .  1 of massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "thus , a survey for wrs has to be sufficiently sensitive to detect weak - lined wns if it is going to be useful for comparing with the predictions of the evolutionary models .",
    "armandroff & massey ( 1985 ) described a set of interference filters that has proven very effective at this task : three 50    wide filters centered on c iii @xmath2 , he  ii @xmath3 , and neighboring continuum at @xmath8 are used to image a region with ccds , and the brightness of objects compared .",
    "this was done by armandroff & massey ( 1985 ) , massey et al .",
    "( 1986 , 1992 ) , and massey & johnson ( 1998 ) to survey small regions of local group galaxies beyond the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , parts of m31 , m33 , ngc  6822 , ic  1613 , ic 10 , and ngc  6822 ) using the relatively tiny ccds that were then available .",
    "crowded - field photometry algorithms ( i.e. , psf - fitting with _ daophot _ , stetson 1987 ) were then used to find wr candidates that were significantly brighter in one of the on - band filters compared to the expected photometric errors .",
    "more recently , we have been able to take advantage of ccd cameras with much larger fields of view to survey all of m33 ( neugent & massey 2011 ) and m31 ( neugent et al .",
    "these two surveys used image - subtraction techniques to search for candidates in order to avoid the many false positives that plagued the photometry method .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation of these candidates demonstrated that we were finding wrs as weak - lined as any known , and indeed finding new of - type stars with even smaller emission - lines fluxes , lending some confidence that these surveys were sufficiently sensitive and deep to be detecting the vast majority of the wns .    for the smc , massey & duffy ( 2001 ) undertook such a survey using a wide - area ccd on the ctio curtis schmidt .",
    "it covered 9.6 deg@xmath9 and spectroscopy confirmed two new wr stars ( both wns ) , bringing the total number of known wrs in the smc to 11 , the result of photometry of over 1.6 million stars .",
    "still , the survey had some deficiencies : the pixel size with the instrument was 23 , reducing the precision in crowded regions . the areal coverage , while large , did not cover all of the star - forming regions of the smc .",
    "as mentioned above , the next year saw the discovery of a 12th smc wr ( another wn ) which had been overlooked in the massey & duffy ( 2001 ) survey because of crowding .",
    "for the lmc , in the 20 years between the azzopardi & breysacher ( 1979b , 1980 ) survey and the compilation of the bat99  fourth catalogue , \" the number of wrs known grew from 97 to 134 ( roughly 40% ) , mostly as a result of accidental discovery through spectroscopy of stars in selected regions of the clouds , with only 6 found as the result of new objective prism surveys for wrs ( morgan & good 1985 , 1990 ) .",
    "since bat99 , the number of known lmc wrs has grown to 139 ( an increase of 4% ) , including two demotions of wrs to of - type . to us , our discovery ( neugent et al .  2012b ) of a very rare ( and very strong - lined ) wo - type wr in lucke - hodge 41 , a well - studied lmc ob association ( harboring , among other things , another wr star and two lbvs , including the archetype s doradus itself ) , seemed a wakeup call .",
    "we are in the somewhat embarrassing position of knowing more about the wr content of m33 and m31 ( at distances of @xmath10 800 kpc ) than we do about our next - door neighbors , the magellanic clouds ( at distances of 50 - 60 kpc , i.e. , @xmath11 closer ) .",
    "the question , then , was what to do about it .",
    "we decided to survey the magellanic clouds for wrs using the same method that we had so successfully employed in m31 and m33 , using interference - filter imaging and image - subtraction to identify wr candidates and then using spectroscopy to confirm and classify them .",
    "the task , however , is quite daunting , as one of the things that makes the magellanic clouds so attractive  their closeness  also results in their very large angular sizes .",
    "the need , however , is timely : improved evolutionary models have become available from the geneva group that actually now predict a significantly smaller wc / wn ratio ( @xmath12 ) for the lmc than the  observed \" ratio ( 0.23 ) .",
    "is the problem with the models , or is the problem that too many wns have been missed in past studies ? at the same time , the cambridge stars evolutionary models continue to improve and become increasingly available ( see , e.g. , eldridge et al .",
    "2008 ) , allowing comparison with models that include the effects of close binary evolution as well .",
    "and , of course , one never knows what surprises await in such new surveys , as we shall see .",
    "here we report the results of our first observing season .",
    "although we have only surveyed @xmath0% of the smc and lmc , we have already discovered nine new wrs ( all in the lmc ) , two interesting ",
    "of?p \" stars , four of - type supergiants and a new o4  v star . of the 9 new wrs ,",
    "the majority show strong early - type absorption .",
    "are these extremely massive binaries , or are they members of a newly discovered class of massive stars ?",
    "we describe the details of the new survey and follow - up spectroscopy in section  [ sec - survey ] , provide our new spectral types in section  [ sec - results ] , demonstrate the sensitivity of our survey in section  [ sec - completeness ] , and discuss the nature of our new discoveries in section  [ sec - sum ] .",
    "in designing our survey we were guided by wide - field (  parking - lot camera \" ) images of the smc and lmc described by bothun & thompson ( 1988 ) and kindly made available by g. bothun .",
    "we decided to survey a region extending 30 in radius ( 28.3 deg@xmath9 ) centered on @xmath13 for the smc , and a region extending 35 in radius ( 38.5 deg@xmath9 ) centered on @xmath14 for the lmc .",
    "these areas are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : smc ] and  [ fig : lmc ] , respectively .",
    "these regions encompass all of the hii regions shown in the parking - lot camera h@xmath15 images , as well as cataloged ob associations shown by hodge ( 1985 ) and lucke & hodge ( 1970 ) .",
    "note that the area to be surveyed in the smc will be @xmath16 larger than that covered by massey & duffy ( 2001 ) .",
    "the choice of telescopes and instruments was straight - forward .",
    "as far as the imaging was concerned , one thing we had learned from the massey & duffy ( 2001 ) survey was that good image scale is crucial in dealing with the crowding that often characterizes the location of massive stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "thus , we would rather deal with more fields ( and a longer project ) than accept a pixel scale of 1 - 2 . at the same time , the larger the field of view ( fov ) , the better in keeping the project finite .",
    "we realized that the las campanas 1  m swope would provide a modestly large fov ( 0.094 deg@xmath9 ) with good image scale ( 0435 pixel@xmath17 ) . despite this",
    ", it would require @xmath18 fields to cover the lmc , and @xmath19 for the smc , allowing for some overlap between fields .",
    "we estimated that we would achieve adequate signal - to - noise in a few minutes per filter , and thus if we planned on 6 fields per hour ( optimistic as it turned out ) the survey would require  only \" 130 hours , or about 20 nights of observing , a large but not impossible amount .",
    "( the camera has since been replaced with an even better system , with a 0.21 deg@xmath9 fov , a factor of 2.2@xmath5 larger , more than off - setting our optimism about the number of fields per hour ; see below . ) as for the spectroscopy , the faintness ( @xmath20 ) and need for good signal - to - noise at reasonable exposure times led us to the magellan telescopes , and in particular the magellan echellette spectrograph ( mage ) implemented on the 6.5  m clay telescope ( marshall et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "our recent wr surveys of m33 ( neugent & massey 2011 ) and m31 ( neugent et al .",
    "2012a ) used the  standard \" _ wc _ , _ wn _ , and _ ct _ wr filters developed and first used by armandroff & massey ( 1985 ) .",
    "these filters have bandpasses that are @xmath1050    wide , and are centered on c iii @xmath2 ( _ wc _ filter ) , he  ii @xmath3 ( _ wn _ filter ) , and continuum at @xmath8 ( _ ct _ filter ) .",
    "we needed new versions of these that would fit the 3-inch @xmath5 3-inch filter holder of the swope , and we had 2-cavity interference filters made to similar specifications by the andover corporation .",
    "the filters have very good transmission ( @xmath1080% at their peaks ) and full - widths at half - maximum ( fwhm ) bandpasses of 51 - 55   , with 10% band widths of @xmath1090   .",
    "we note that one problem with this filter set is that foreground m dwarfs can be picked up as wr candidates as they have a strong tio absorption band at @xmath21 , which falls in the continuum band .",
    "we were confident , however , that 2mass colors would allow us to eliminate the majority of such spurious candidates in the magellanic clouds , an option we did not have in the case of m31 and m33 , as those candidates were much fainter than sources in the 2mass catalog . in fig .  [",
    "fig : test ] we superimpose the transmission curves of these filters on two fluxed spectra of newly discovered wr stars we will discuss later in this paper .",
    "our inaugural imaging run took place on 9 nights 2013 sept 21 - 29 ( ut ) using the site#3 ccd camera .",
    "the ccd was a @xmath22 device ( formatted to @xmath23 to avoid vignetting ) with 15@xmath24 m ( 0435 ) pixels ; each exposure thus covered 148@xmath5228 . on the first night",
    "we observed 18 fields with 120 s exposures through each of our filters .",
    "the seeing was poor , 16 - 30 .",
    "examination of the data in real time cast doubt that we were going sufficiently deep : we found that we were detecting the faintest and weakest - lined of the known wns but not with extremely high confidence .",
    "after the first night we increased our exposure times by a factor of 2.5 ( i.e. , by 1 mag ) to 300 s per filter , and repeated all of the first night fields with these longer exposure times , finding that we were now extremely sure of our detections for all of the previously known wrs .",
    "we were closed due to high winds and poor seeing for most of the second night , and had some unusually poor seeing and clouds on the sixth night , but for the remainder of the time we had good conditions .",
    "our typical seeing was 12 - 19 , with a median value of 15 .",
    "occasionally the seeing was worse than 2 \" , in which case we repeated the field on another occasion .",
    "the observing run substantiated that our goal of covering all of the magellanic clouds is practical , and we can now provide a more accurate estimate of what will be needed .",
    "in addition to 15 minutes of exposure per field , our overhead was significant , and dominated by the relatively long read - out times , 127 s per image .",
    "unfortunately we discovered that we could not slew the telescope to the next target during the final readout without introducing streaks into our data , and so the total time spent on reading out the chip was 6.4 minutes per field .",
    "slewing and setting up the guider did not take much time , usually just 2 - 3 minutes per field , and so in practice we managed about 2.5 fields per hour .",
    "we also stopped to focus and check the telescope pointing 2 - 3@xmath5 a night , each requiring about 10 minutes . in the end",
    "we obtained satisfactory data on 51 fields in the smc , and 76 fields in the lmc ( 127 in total ) , about 15 - 17% of our desired coverage for each galaxy , in essentially 6 good nights ( eliminating the times of poor seeing , high winds and clouds ) observing about 8.5 hours on the clouds each night . with the new camera",
    ", we will have a @xmath25 improvement in areal coverage and much shorter readout times , and we foresee another @xmath1015 clear nights will be needed to complete the survey . we have been fortunate in already being assigned 10 nights for the 2014 magellanic cloud observing season .",
    "we took @xmath1010 bias frames and 3 dome flats per filter daily , and tried to obtain good sky flats through at least one of the filters each evening .",
    "we reduced the data nightly using iraf .",
    "we found that the biases were indeed useful , as there was a 12 adu turn - up on the left side of the images that was well taken out by the bias frames .",
    "the dome flats did an excellent job of removing the pixel - to - pixel variations and large - scale donuts due to dust specks on the dewar window , but the sky flats were necessary to remove a 4 - 5% gradient in the y ( ns ) direction due to the dome flats not illuminating the chip quite the same way as the sky .    prior to running the image subtraction software , we needed to carefully align the images . in order to determine accurate shifts we used iraf s",
    "_ daofind _ to find sources that were 10@xmath26 or higher above the noise of the background .",
    "we then matched the sources between the three filters with the assumption that the shifts were small , finding the median pixel shifts .",
    "next , we shifted the _",
    "wn _ and _ wc _ images to align with the _ ct _ images using a cubic spline interpolation .",
    "we also added an accurate world coordinate system to the headers of each shifted image using the  astrometry.net \" software ( lang et al .",
    "at this point the images were ready for image - subtraction .    for the image subtraction",
    ", we used the high order transform of psf and template subtraction ( _ hotpants _ ) code written by andrew becker , described briefly in becker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and in more detail on his webpage , as carlos contreras ( 2013 , private communication ) reported excellent results with this code on images taken with the swope .",
    "[ fig : wow ] shows the results of the image subtraction on one of our smc fields .",
    "there are two known wrs in the image , smc - wr6 ( azv 332 = sk 108 ) on the left , and smc - wr12 on the right . the former is the brightest ( @xmath27 ) wr in the smc ( other than hd 5980 , an unusual lbv / wr object ) , while the latter is the faintest ( @xmath28 ) and among the weakest - lined wrs ; see table 1 in massey et al .",
    "both wrs show up unambiguously in the difference frame at the bottom .",
    "the bright wr is not close to saturation ( on our _ wn _ frame it is 1.5 mag fainter than where non - linearity would become a significant issue ) , while the faint wr has a nominal signal - to - noise on the resultant image of 200 .",
    "after the subtracted images were produced , each of the resultant images was examined for wr candidates .",
    "all previously known wrs in our frames were readily detected except for the most crowded members of r136 .",
    "candidates were classified into three classes depending upon how certain we felt about the detection and the significance of the magnitude differences we computed from photometry of the frames .",
    "the list was then checked against known objects in the clouds and 2mass photometry ; this allowed us to eliminate many planetary nebulae ( which will show he  ii @xmath3 nebula emission if the radiation field is hard enough ) , known of - type stars , and very red stars which we expect to show up because of the tio absorption feature in the _ ct _ filter .",
    "in practice the process of identifying candidates from the subtracted images was somewhat iterative .",
    "we had an opportunity to observe a few candidates spectroscopically within a few weeks of our imaging run , and selected 8 candidates that spanned a range in our confidence level to help us evaluate our search .",
    "we were greatly encouraged that most but not all of these proved to be new wr stars ( as described below ) , substantiating that our project was not in vain .      for our spectroscopic",
    "followup , we used mage ( marshall et al .",
    "2008 ) on the clay 6.5-m magellan telescope .",
    "we had previously been assigned two nights , ut 2013 oct 16 and dec 14 , as part of our spectroscopic survey of massive stars in the magellanic clouds ( see , e.g. , neugent et al .",
    "francesco di mille kindly provided a few additional spectra obtained on ut oct 18 and dec 16 , 2013 , during engineering time .",

    "mage provides wavelength coverage from the atmospheric cut - off ( @xmath103200   ) through 1@xmath24 m at a resolving power of 4100 with a 1 \" slit .",
    "because of the large wavelength coverage , obtaining flat fields with sufficient signal - to - noise so as to not degrade the actual spectra is very tricky .",
    "we have found that we can achieve high signal - to - noise ( 100 - 200 ) by _ not _ flat fielding , owing to the intrinsic flatness ( uniformity ) of the chip ( see discussion in massey & hanson 2013 ) .",

    "if we detect a certain magnitude difference between the on - line wr filter and the off - line continuum filter , how significant is this difference compared to the photometric error associated with the difference ? in other words , if the magnitude difference is @xmath68  mag and the uncertainty in the magnitude is 0.05  mag , we would consider this a 10@xmath26 detection .",
    "this is probably what limits the detectability when we visually examine the difference frames after our image subtraction .",

    "such a situation would result in a low significance level . at the same time",

    "of course , the significance level will depend upon the details of the survey and the observing conditions : a 3@xmath26 detection with one set of exposure times could be a 30@xmath26 detection if the exposure time were increased a hundred fold , although the magnitude difference would remain the same .",
    "one should recall that we adjusted our exposure times to make the faintest and weakest - lined wns known in the smc easy detections .",

    "wn3+o3  v objects are some of the smc wn3 stars which show the absorption signature of an early - type o star , although none as early as o3  v ( table 1 of massey et al .",
    "none of these have been shown to be binaries . however , they are all significantly more luminous than ours ( @xmath69 to @xmath70 ) and therefore could simply be multiples viewed at unfavorable inclinations , or whose components are too widely separated to have detectable radial velocity variations .    what , then , is the nature of our ",
    "wn3+o3  v \" objects ?",
    "there are several reasons why these stars are unlikely to be actual wn3+o3  v pairs .",
    "first , o3  v stars are the ",
    "rarest of the rare , \" as only the most luminous and massive stars start their lives in an o3  v phase .",
    "( only stars of 50@xmath71 and larger obtain sufficiently high effective temperatures to be spectroscopically identified as o3 stars ; see , e.g. , ekstrm et al .",
    "thus , outside of the concentration of o3 stars in the very young and massive r136 cluster ( massey & hunter 1998 ) , only about a dozen o3  v stars are known in the entire lmc ( skiff 2014 ) .",
    "so , to have come across five o3  v stars that just all happen to be members of a binary system with wn3 stars seems rather far - fetched . a second , and perhaps more irrefutable argument , is that the absolute magnitudes of these",
    " wn3 + o3  v \" systems are all quite faint , with @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "but , this is much fainter than an o3  v star ( @xmath74 , conti 1988 ) , and in fact is even faint for a wn3 ( @xmath75 , hainich et al .",
    "thus , there would seem to be no way that these objects can truly consist of a wn3+o3  v pair .",
    "third , we have two observations for three of these systems , and none show the radial velocity variations we might expect to find in binaries .",
    "finally , such a wn3+o3  v system would be very hard to understand from an evolution point of view : the o3  v component must be quite young ( @xmath761 - 2  myr ) , while it would have taken several million years to have formed the wr component .    with five such objects ( and likely a sixth )",
    "we are forced to conclude that we have discovered a hitherto unrecognized class of wrs , stars that are under - luminous visually and whose winds are thin enough to show underlying absorption . for absorption lines to be present from the wr itself",
    "requires a different set of physical conditions in the stellar wind than is found in other wrs .",
    "are these ",
    "wn3+o3  v \" stars even evolved objects ? a preliminary effort at modeling the optical data of lmc170 - 2 using cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ) shows that a good match to the observed spectrum ( emission _ and _ absorption ) can be achieved with a model using a high effective temperature ( @xmath1080,000 - 100,000 k ) along with a strongly enhanced helium ( he / h@xmath101.0 by number ) and nitrogen abundances ( @xmath1010 @xmath5 solar ) , indicative of advanced cno processing .",
    "the models require mass - loss rates of @xmath77 yr@xmath17 , corrected for clumping using a volume filling factor of 0.1 .",
    "[ fig : john ] shows how successful the best - fitting model matches the spectrum .",
    "the high effective temperatures would imply a bolometric luminosity of @xmath78 5.3 - 5.6 .",
    "these physical parameters are all in accord with what we expect for lmc wn3 stars ( hainich et al .",
    "2014 ) , except for the mass - loss rate , which is lower than what we expect for a wn3 star by a factor of 3 ( see fig .  6 of hainich et al .  2014 ) , and more similar to what we would expect from o2 - 3  v stars ( see , e.g. , massey et al .  2005 ) .",
    "however , none of these values are well determined by the optical data alone , as we lack lines arising from multiple ionization stages of the same species , severely hindering our ability to constrain the effective temperature .",
    "for instance , we detect he  ii but not he  i , and we see n  v but not n  iv .",
    "we have applied for _ hst _ time to obtain the uv data needed to better determine these values , as these will provide additional ionization states ( for instance , n  iv @xmath79 ) , and key diagnostics of the stellar wind ( e.g. , c  iv @xmath80 ) .",
    "the full modeling will be discussed once those data are obtained , or , if we are not successful in securing uv data , once we have additional optical data .",
    "but the preliminary modeling does show that the observed spectra _ can _ be produced by a single object , and ( if our effective temperatures are correct ) that the bolometric luminosities , and hence the progenitor masses , would be normal rather than small .",
    "why the mass - loss rates are low , and how these stars evolved , remain unanswered questions for the present .",
    "are they the hitherto unrecognized products of single star evolution , or are binary models needed to produce such objects ? if the latter , then where is the spectroscopic signature of the companion ?",
    "the results from our first observing season have certainly justified in our minds the effort involved in our survey . as figs .",
    "[ fig : smc ] and [ fig : lmc ] show , we have so far concentrated on where many wrs were already known .",
    "so it is possible that that we will have a lower success rate next year in terms of finding new ones . on the other hand",
    ", we will not know until we look .",
    "will any new ones be as equally intriguing as the ones we found this year ? we look forward to more surprises .",
    "we thank nolan walborn for his useful , constructive referee report , and in particular in suggesting several refinements to our classification of the o - type stars .",
    "deidre hunter and an earlier , anonymous referee also helped us improve the presentation of the material .",
    "we also thank carlos contreras for his suggestion to try the image subtraction code _ hotpants _ as well as his help in getting it to execute successfully .",
