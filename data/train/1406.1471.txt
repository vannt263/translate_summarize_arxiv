    "over the last ten years , many - body entanglement has become the subject of intense theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "there are important reasons to study quantum entanglement in many - body systems . on the one hand",
    ", the scaling of entanglement can be used as a tool to detect and characterize emergent quantum phenomena , such as quantum criticality @xcite and topological order @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "understanding the structure of many - body entanglement leads to efficient tensor network descriptions of many - body wave - functions @xcite .",
    "tensor networks can in turn be used to efficiently simulate many - body systems , and to classify the possible phases of quantum matter @xcite .",
    "most studies of many - body entanglement are based on characterizing bipartite entanglement . for that purpose ,",
    "the many - body system is virtually divided into two regions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and a measure of entanglement is used to quantify the entanglement between these regions .",
    "a prominent choice of measure of entanglement is the von neumann entropy @xmath4 of part @xmath0 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density matrix for part @xmath0 , and where we assumed that the whole system is in a pure state @xmath7 .",
    "let us specialize to the case where @xmath7 is the ground state of a local hamiltonian on a lattice in @xmath8 spatial dimensions .",
    "a central observation is that the entanglement between of a region @xmath0 of size @xmath9 and the ( much larger ) rest @xmath1 of the lattice is then often proportional to the size @xmath10 of the boundary @xmath11 of region @xmath0 , @xmath12 thus , ground state entanglement typically obeys a _ boundary law _",
    "@xcite , as opposed to the _ bulk law _",
    "@xmath13 obeyed by generic states in the many - body hilbert space .",
    "the boundary law of eq .",
    "[ eq : boundary ] is observed in the ground state of _ gapped _ local hamiltonian in arbitrary dimension @xmath8 , as well as in some _ gapless _ systems in @xmath14 dimensions .",
    "instead , in gapless systems in @xmath2 dimensions , as well as in certain gapless systems in @xmath14 dimensions ( namely systems with a fermi surface of dimension @xmath15 ) , ground state entanglement displays a logarithmic correction to the boundary law @xcite , @xmath16      at an intuitive level , the boundary law of eq .",
    "[ eq : boundary ] is understood as resulting from entanglement that involves degrees of freedom located near the boundary between regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "also intuitively , the logarithmic correction of eq . [ eq : logarithm ] is argued to have its origin in contributions to entanglement from degrees of freedom that are further away from the boundary between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to propose a simple formalism capable of testing the above intuitions , both qualitatively and quantitatively . given the entanglement @xmath4 between regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we investigate the possibility of introducing a function @xmath17 , the _ entanglement contour _ , that assigns a real number @xmath18 to each lattice site @xmath19 contained in region @xmath0 such that the sum of @xmath20 over all the sites @xmath21 is equal to the entanglement entropy @xmath4 , @xmath22 and that aims to quantifying how much the degrees of freedom in site @xmath19 participate in / contribute to the entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig:1dgapped ] shows the entanglement contour for in gapped 1d systems ( with open and periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "we emphasize at the outset that the entanglement contour @xmath20 is _ not _ equivalent to the von neumann entropy @xmath23 of the reduced density matrix @xmath24 at site @xmath19 .",
    "notice that , indeed , the von neumann entropy of individual sites in region @xmath0 is _ not _ additive in the presence of correlations between the sites , and therefore generically @xmath25 whereas the entanglement contour @xmath20 is required to fulfill eq .",
    "[ eq : aaa ] .",
    "relatedly , when site @xmath19 is only entangled with neighboring sites contained within region @xmath0 , and it is thus uncorrelated with region @xmath1 , the entanglement contour @xmath20 will be required to vanish , whereas the one - site von neumann entropy @xmath26 still takes a non - zero value due to the presence of local entanglement within region @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is divided into several sections . in section [",
    "sect : contour ] we introduce the requirements the entanglement contour @xmath20 should satisfy .",
    "these requirements may be fulfilled by several functions , and therefore may not uniquely determine the entanglement contour .",
    "in section [ sect : free ] we then propose a specific function @xmath27 within the free fermion formalism , and prove that it fulfills all the required constraints .",
    "then the rest of the paper is devoted to exploring the proposed entanglement contour @xmath28 for free fermions in a number of different settings .",
    "first , in section [ sect:1d ] we consider the ground state of quadratic fermionic hamiltonians in one spatial dimension .",
    "there , the entanglement contour is seen to discriminate between gapped and gapless systems , and to display a universal profile at quantum criticality , from which one can extract the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory . in section [ sect:2d ]",
    "we then consider ground states of quadratic fermionic hamiltonians in two spatial dimensions , and find that the entanglement contour is sensitive to whether the hamiltonian is gapped or gapless and , in the latter case , to the presence of a fermi surface .",
    "in section [ sect : quench ] we consider time evolution after local and global quantum quenches @xcite , and show that the entanglement contour unveils a detailed dynamical structure of propagation of entanglement within region @xmath0 . finally , section [ sect : discussion ] contains some discussion and conclusions .",
    "overall , our results show that the entanglement contour provides useful insights into the spatial structure of many - body entanglement , well beyond what is already available from the entanglement entropy @xmath4 alone and similar to what is possible with other tools ( see _ previous work _",
    "below ) .      sections [ sect :",
    "contour ] and [ sect : free ] contain several technical details that may well be skipped when first reading this manuscript .",
    "the key point is that the formalism of fermionic gaussian states offers a natural definition of the entanglement contour ( in terms of probabilistic average of contributions coming from the fermionic modes that diagonalize the reduced density matrix @xmath29 ) , see eq .",
    "[ eq : fermion_si ] , which fulfills all the requirements .",
    "sections [ sect:1d]-[sect : quench ] offer an easy - to - read , rather descriptive list of simple applications , which both demonstrate with concrete examples the use of the entanglement contour as a finer characterization of entanglement in extended quantum systems and suggest other possible applications and extensions of the results presented here . after becoming familiar with those examples",
    ", the interested reader may then want to go back to sections [ sect : contour ] and [ sect : free ] to learn in more detail the proposed formalism .",
    "the locality of entanglement entropy in many - body ground states has been previously probed using a number of other tools , some of which we briefly review below .",
    "we notice that none of these other tools , albeit extremely useful in characterizing the structure of many - body entanglement , define a proper contour for entanglement entropy , in the sense of fulfilling the basic requirement of eq .",
    "[ eq : aaa ] , namely that when summed up over region @xmath0 , the contour should lead to the entanglement entropy of region @xmath0 .",
    "the _ quantum mutual information _ @xmath30 between regions @xmath31 and @xmath32 of a many - body system ( where @xmath33 is itself only part of the system ) provides a measure of correlations between the two regions .",
    "it has been used to obtain insights into the structure of entanglement in the ground state of 1d systems and 2d systems , as well as in local and global quenches @xcite .",
    "the _ entanglement negativity _",
    "@xmath34 @xcite is a measure of entanglement of mixed states that has similarly been used to identify which local degrees of freedom contribute to the entanglement between two regions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the locality of the entanglement in gapped systems was explored by developing a boundary - link perturbation theory capable of reproducing at the structure of entanglement spectrum .",
    "the _ density of entanglement _",
    "@xmath35 was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for continuous systems as the derivative of the entanglement entropy @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the left and right boundaries of region @xmath0 .",
    "the entanglement density has been effectively used to study local and global quenches in continuous systems , providing similar insight to the one offered in this context by the entanglement contour .",
    "much closer to our proposal are the studies of the lowest single - particle eigenfunctions of the entanglement hamiltonian of refs .",
    "@xcite . indeed , the entanglement contour for free fermions @xmath28 , as introduced in sect .",
    "[ sect : free ] , can be interpreted as a weighted average over entanglement contributions made by the single - particle eigenfunctions of the entanglement hamiltonian .",
    "in those settings ( e.g. gapped 1d systems ) where only a few such eigenfunctions are relevant , their real - space profile provides similar insights as the entanglement contour .",
    "in this section we introduce the notion of entanglement contour and list a number of properties that it should fulfill .",
    "recall first that the entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is naturally described by the coefficients @xmath38 appearing in the schmidt decomposition of the state @xmath7 , @xmath39 these coefficients @xmath38 correspond to the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath29 , whose spectral decomposition reads @xmath40 they define a probability distribution , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , in terms of which the von neumann entropy @xmath4 is @xmath43 on the other hand , the hilbert space @xmath44 of region @xmath0 factorizes as the tensor product @xmath45 where @xmath46 describes the local hilbert space of site @xmath19 .    the reduced density matrix @xmath29 in eq .",
    "[ eq : rhoa1 ] and the factorization of eq .",
    "[ eq : va ] define two inequivalent structures within the vector space @xmath47 of region @xmath0 .",
    "the entanglement contour @xmath17 is a function from the set of sites @xmath21 to the real numbers , @xmath48 that attempts to relate these two structures , by distributing the von - neumann entropy @xmath4 of eq .",
    "[ eq : sp ] among the sites @xmath21 .",
    "let us list the constraints we require on the entanglement contour @xmath20 .",
    "the first two conditions are very simple :    1 .",
    "positivity : @xmath49 .",
    "normalization : @xmath50",
    ".    these constraints amount to defining a probability distribution @xmath51 over the sites @xmath21 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 , such that @xmath54 .",
    "notice that these two conditions alone , however , do not require @xmath17 to inform us about the spatial structure of entanglement in @xmath0  they only relate to the density matrix @xmath55 through its total von neumann entropy @xmath4 .",
    "a first step towards taking the explicit form of @xmath55 into account is by further requiring the following condition .    1",
    ".   symmetry : if @xmath56 is a symmetry of @xmath29 , that is @xmath57 , and @xmath56 exchanges site @xmath19 with site @xmath58 , then @xmath59 .",
    "this condition ensures that the entanglement contour is the same on two sites @xmath19 and @xmath58 of region @xmath0 that , as far as entanglement is concerned , play an equivalent role in region @xmath0 .",
    "it uses the ( possible ) presence of a spatial symmetry , such as invariance under space reflection , or under discrete translations / rotations , to define an equivalence relation in the set of sites of region @xmath0 , and requires that the entanglement contour be constant within each resulting equivalence class .",
    "notice , however , that this condition does not tell us whether the entanglement contour should be large or small on a given site ( or equivalence class of site ) .",
    "in particular , the three conditions above are satisfied by a canonical choice @xmath60 , that is a flat entanglement contour over the @xmath61 sites contained in region @xmath0 , which once more does not tell us anything about the spatial structure of the von neumann entropy in @xmath29 .",
    "the remaining conditions refer to subregions within region @xmath0 , instead of referring to single sites .",
    "it is therefore convenient to ( trivially ) extend the definition of entanglement contour to a set @xmath31 of sites in region @xmath0 , @xmath62 , with vector space @xmath63 as the sum of the contour over the sites in @xmath31 , @xmath64 it follows from this extension that for any two disjoint subsets @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , the contour is additive , @xmath67 in particular , condition 2 can be now recast as @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath65 , are such that all the sites of @xmath69 are also contained in @xmath70 , @xmath71 , then the contour must be larger on @xmath70 than on @xmath69 ( monotonicity of @xmath72 ) , @xmath73    our next condition refers to transformations that can not change the value of @xmath72 on a subset of sites @xmath74 .    1 .",

    "fig : localquench1 ] for comparison .",
    "all these observations seem compatible with the existence of propagating pseudo - particles as proposed in earlier work and analyzed using correlations and entanglement entropies for a multiplicity of cuts @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the entanglement contour after a global quench .",
    "as in the previous example , we consider a @xmath2 dimensional lattice with the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath133 given by eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] with @xmath373 , which corresponds to a gapped system .",
    "this time , however , we choose the setting of fig .",
    "[ fig:1dchain2 ] , namely an infinite lattice with a region @xmath0 of finite size @xmath149 and with two boundary cuts . at time @xmath374 the system is in its ground state .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath375 is some finite constant and its contour decays exponentially with the distance to each of the two boundary cuts .",
    "the contour @xmath282 at @xmath374 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : globalquench1 ] ( left - most and right - most lines at the bottom , in blue ) .    from @xmath374",
    "onwards , the system evolves according to the unitary time evolution operator @xmath390 , where the hamiltonian @xmath372 corresponds to eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] with @xmath391 .",
    "that is , we have made a sudden change in the chemical potential , such that the system has become gapless . under this global quench ,",
    "regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are still connected by @xmath372 , and therefore entanglement entropy can be created during the time evolution . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : globalquench1 ] , @xmath392 grows linearly as a function of @xmath389 , starting from an almost vanishing value at @xmath374 , until it reaches some form of saturation at time @xmath393 .",
    "the entanglement contour offers again a much more detailed description of the time - dependent , spatial structure of quantum entanglement . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : globalquench1 ] , we can see that the degrees of freedom in @xmath0 that are entangled with @xmath1 are initially concentrated only near the boundary cuts .",
    "however , as time passes , more degrees of freedom in region @xmath0 , further away from the boundary cuts , also contribute to the entanglement with region @xmath1 .",
    "we can see two _ entanglement fronts _ progressing at constant speed from the two boundaries towards the center of region @xmath0 , for times @xmath394 $ ] .",
    "the two entanglement fronts cross without interfering with each other ( but since the contour is the sum of the contributions by the two fronts , their crossing results in a new plateau that now grows from the center of region @xmath0 ) and then continue to advance until they hit the boundary of @xmath0 opposite to the one they started from , at time @xmath395 ) . then the contour @xmath384 has become roughly flat and stops evolving in time .",
    "this coincides in time with the saturation of the entanglement entropy @xmath392 .",
    "entanglement contour after a global quench in a lattice made of @xmath319 sites .",
    "the ground state of a gapped hamiltonian @xmath133 with @xmath386 is made evolve according to a gapless hamiltonian @xmath372 with @xmath396 .",
    "the figure shows the entanglement contour @xmath388 of a region @xmath0 made of @xmath397 sites .",
    "an entanglement front progresses from left to right ( and from right to left ) , as described in the main text .",
    "the inset shows the entanglement entropy @xmath392 , which grows linearly in time while the two entanglement fronts progress front one boundary of @xmath0 to the opposite one and then back , and which saturates to a constant once the entanglement fronts have completed their progression through region @xmath0 ]    in summary , the linear regime in the growth of @xmath392 in time is explained in terms of the constant speed of the two entanglement fronts , whereas the saturation of @xmath392 at long times is a consequence of the arrival of the entanglement fronts to the opposite ends of region @xmath0 .",
    "again , the above observations appear compatible with the existence of propagating pseudo - particles , as analyzed using e.g. mutual information @xcite or entanglement density @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have introduced the notion of entanglement contour @xmath17 as a means to characterize which degrees of freedom of a region @xmath0 contribute to the entanglement entropy @xmath4 between region @xmath0 and the rest @xmath1 of an extended quantum many - body system .",
    "we have proposed several properties that the entanglement contour should satisfy , and have identified a quantity @xmath28 for fermionic gaussian states which fulfills these properties .",
    "then we have explored the entanglement contour in selected ground states and during the time evolution that ensues a local or global quantum quench . this has allowed us to illustrate , through concrete examples , the potential of the entanglement contour as a means to provide a characterization of the entanglement between regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 than is finer than the one provided by the entanglement entropy @xmath4 alone .",
    "we have been able to formalize , and quantitatively characterize , the intuition that ground state entanglement in gapped systems involves , essentially , only the degrees of freedom near the boundary of region @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we have seen that , in gapless systems , also degrees of freedom that are far away from the boundary of @xmath0 contribute significantly to the entanglement entropy @xmath4 . in @xmath2 dimensions the entanglement contour @xmath17 has allowed us to estimate the central charge @xmath295 of the underlying cft by studying a single region @xmath0 ( as opposed to multiple regions with different sizes , as needed in order to extract the central charge from the entanglement entropy @xmath4 ) ; and in @xmath344 dimensions it has allowed us to discriminate between gapped systems and gapless systems with a finite number of zero modes ( these two type of system obey a boundary law for the entanglement entropy @xmath4 , and therefore can not be distinguished using only the scaling of @xmath4 ) .",
    "finally , we have seen that the entanglement contour reveals a detailed real - space structure of the entanglement of a region @xmath0 and its dynamics , well beyond what is accessible from the entanglement entropy @xmath4 alone .",
    "for instance , after a local quench that detaches region @xmath0 from region @xmath1 , we have seen that while @xmath4 remains constant , the entanglement propagates within region @xmath0 in a wave - like manner , suggesting that perhaps its dynamics obeys a simple differential equation . on the other hand , after a global quench , we have seen an entanglement front sweeping region @xmath0 at constant speed from each boundary to the opposite one , offering insights into the well - known linear growth , then saturation of the entanglement entropy @xmath392 .",
    "most of the results presented in this paper can be generalized to free fermionic quantum fields , and also to lattice models and quantum field theories of free bosons .",
    "free fermion / boson models , on the lattice or in the continuum , have played and continue to play a leading role in the development of a theory of entanglement in extended quantum systems .",
    "we hope that the entanglement contour @xmath28 will add to the previously existing tools used to characterize entanglement in such systems .",
    "needless to say , however , the truly interesting ( and much more challenging ) extended systems are those of interacting particles .",
    "we leave the study of an entanglement contour for interacting systems for future work .",
