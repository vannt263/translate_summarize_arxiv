    "a major theme of cosmology for several decades has been the determination of the best cosmological model to describe our universe . by the early 1990s",
    ", evidence was already accumulating from measurements of large - scale structure and the cosmic microwave background that if the universe was flat , the matter density was well below the critical value , requiring an additional ( large ) contribution from a non - zero cosmological constant term @xcite .",
    "this `` @xmath11cdm''cosmology , dominated by the cosmological constant ( @xmath11 ) and cold dark matter ( cdm ) , although radical at the time , predicted an older age for the universe than other models , so was more consistent with observational lower limits to the age @xcite .",
    "additional early support for a non - zero cosmological constant was provided by @xcite in their analysis of faint near - infrared galaxy counts . the case for a @xmath11cdm cosmology",
    "was strengthened dramatically in the late 1990s by the measurement from distant type ia supernovae of the acceleration in the expansion rate of the universe @xcite .",
    "the goal of cosmology now is to test different models of the underlying physics responsible for this acceleration , dubbed `` dark energy '' .",
    "this research has focused around the dark energy equation of state ( parameterised by @xmath12 , so pressure equals @xmath10 times density ) and how it changes with time .",
    "a central goal is to measure @xmath12 at multiple redshifts to test various dark energy models @xcite .",
    "a powerful way to test the dark energy models is to measure the geometrical relations between distance and redshift .",
    "these can be measured by observing the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale imprinted on the distribution of baryonic matter at recombination @xcite .",
    "the bao signal has been clearly measured in the cosmic microwave background ( i.e.  at recombination ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , the 2df galaxy redshift survey ; ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have permitted the detection of the bao signal in the distribution of low - redshift ( @xmath130.35 ) galaxies .",
    "the 2dfgrs detection was reported by @xcite and @xcite ; the sdss result was reported by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these galaxy samples are too nearby to be sensitive to the cosmic effects of dark energy , but provide a superb validation of the concept .",
    "measurement of the bao scale in the galaxy distribution at high redshifts provides a powerful test of the dark energy models .",
    "it gives a geometrical measurement of the universe at different redshifts which delineates the cosmic expansion history with high accuracy and traces the effects of dark energy @xcite .",
    "it also provides a unique and direct measurement of the expansion rate at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the most important advantage of the bao measurement is that its measurement is completely independent of the supernova results and , in particular , is less susceptible to systematic errors .",
    "it is also complementary to the supernova results in that the measurement uncertainties are orthogonal to those of the supernova measurements @xcite .",
    "the wigglez dark energy survey is a major large - scale structure survey of uv - selected emission - line galaxies .",
    "the survey is designed to map a cosmic volume large enough to measure the imprint of baryon oscillations in the clustering pattern ( this requires @xmath14 gpc@xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at a significantly higher redshift ( @xmath15 ) than has been previously achieved .",
    "its core science goals are :    1 .   to calculate the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution with sufficient precision to identify and measure the baryon acoustic oscillation scale to within 2 per cent ; 2 .   to determine the value of the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath10 , to within 10 per cent when combined with cmb data , and hence either independently validate or refute the currently - favoured `` cosmological constant '' model .",
    "the redshift range of the wigglez dark energy survey will make it the first bao survey to sample the epoch when the universe makes the transition from matter - dominated to lambda - dominated expansion .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed description of the survey and the key innovations that were developed to allow it to proceed .",
    "we start with a description of the survey design and its requirements in section  [ sec - design ] .",
    "this is followed in section  [ sec - target ] with details of the selection of our target galaxies from uv data combined with optical data .",
    "the uv selection of the target galaxies means they have strong emission lines , so their redshifts can be measured in relatively short exposures on a 4m - class telescope like the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) . in section  [ sec - spectroscopy ]",
    "we describe our aat spectroscopic observations and data reduction .",
    "the processing of our data to obtain reliable spectroscopic redshifts is detailed in section  [ sec - redshifts ] .",
    "this includes analysis of the reliability of our redshifts . in section  [ sec - results ] , we present a summary of the initial results of the survey , notably the galaxy properties and the success of the survey design . following this , in section  [ sec - data ]",
    "we describe the data products of the survey , as released in our first public data release accompanying this paper .",
    "we summarise this paper and outline the remaining stages of the survey in section  [ sec - summary ] .    a standard cosmology of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is adopted throughout this paper .",
    "the wigglez dark energy survey is a major large - scale structure survey of intermediate - redshift uv - selected emission - line galaxies , focusing on the redshift range @xmath3 .",
    "the survey is designed to map a cosmic volume of about 1 gpc@xmath5 , sufficient to measure the imprint of baryon oscillations in the clustering pattern at a significantly higher redshift than has been previously achieved .",
    "the resulting measurements of cosmic distances and expansion rates , with uncertainties for each below @xmath19 , will constitute a robust test of the predictions of the `` cosmological constant '' model of dark energy .",
    "detailed forecasts for the survey are presented in @xcite .",
    "the cosmological measurements from a large - scale structure survey should be independent of the galaxy type used , given that the `` bias '' with which galaxies trace the underlying dark matter fluctuations is expected to be a simple linear function on large scales @xcite . in this sense , the choice of the `` tracer population '' of galaxies can be determined by observational considerations such as telescope exposure times and the availability of input imaging data for target selection .",
    "the wigglez survey targets uv - selected bright star - forming galaxies , obtaining redshifts from the characteristic patterns of emission lines .",
    "a series of colour cuts , described below , are used to boost the fraction of targets lying at high redshift .",
    "the choice of blue galaxies was motivated by several considerations : ( 1 ) emission - line redshifts are generally obtainable in short 1-hour exposures at the aat , even in poor weather , with no requirement to detect the galaxy continuum light ; ( 2 ) the increasing star - formation rate density of the universe with redshift results in a significant population of high - redshift @xmath20 targets ; ( 3 ) a large fraction of uv imaging data for target selection was already available as part of the medium imaging survey conducted by the galaxy evolution explorer satellite ( galex ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 4 ) other large - scale structure surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the forthcoming baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have preferred to observe luminous red galaxies , allowing the wigglez survey to constrain any systematic effects arising from the choice of tracer galaxy population ; and ( 5 ) interesting secondary science is achievable from studying bright star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the main disadvantage in the choice of wigglez survey targets is that emission - line galaxies possess a significantly lower clustering amplitude than red galaxies , and hence larger galaxy number densities are required to minimize the shot noise error in the clustering measurement .",
    "however , there is a benefit to the fact that wigglez galaxies avoid the densest environments : non - linear growth of structure  which erases linear - regime signatures in the power spectrum such as baryon oscillations  becomes less significant in the sample .",
    "the wigglez survey goal is to cover @xmath21 deg@xmath6 of the equatorial sky in order to map a sufficiently large cosmic volume to measure the imprint of baryon oscillations in the clustering power spectrum .",
    "the survey was designed such that the average galaxy number density @xmath22 is related to the amplitude of the galaxy clustering power spectrum @xmath23 on the relevant baryon oscillation scales by @xmath24 , implying that the contributions of sample variance and shot noise to the clustering error are equal .",
    "this is the optimal survey strategy for a fixed number of galaxies ( i.e.  fixed observing time ) .",
    "the galaxy selection cuts described below result in an average target density of 340 deg@xmath7 .",
    "the overall survey redshift completeness , allowing for repeat observations of objects originally observed in the poorest conditions , is @xmath25 .",
    "the survey goal is hence to measure @xmath26 galaxies over @xmath21 deg@xmath6 , of which @xmath27 are expected to yield successful redshifts .",
    "we focus on the redshift range @xmath3 which we anticipate will yield our main baryon oscillation distance measurement .",
    "the fraction of redshifts lying in this range is 90 per cent , therefore the average galaxy number density in the range @xmath3 is @xmath28 .",
    "the matter power spectrum amplitude @xmath29 at the characteristic scale of baryon oscillations ( @xmath30 ) is @xmath31 at @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) . assuming a galaxy bias of @xmath34 @xcite and a growth factor @xmath35 ( at @xmath36 ) , the galaxy power spectrum amplitude at @xmath36 is @xmath37 . converting to redshift - space ( using the boost factor @xmath38 where @xmath39 ) we obtain @xmath40 .",
    "the survey value of @xmath41 is therefore equal to 0.84 , close to the optimal condition of @xmath42 .",
    "the average redshift completeness of an individual observation ( or `` pointing '' ) is @xmath43 ( we reach the value of 70% per galaxy mentioned above after repeating measurements made in poor conditions ) .",
    "thus the total number of individual spectra required is @xmath44 . on average",
    "we can use 325 fibres per pointing and obtain 7.4 pointings per night , and therefore can measure the required @xmath45 spectra in 166 nights of clear weather .",
    "this calculation is summarized in table  [ tab - design ] .      a final constraint on the survey design is the availability of suitable optical imaging catalogues in regions of sky overlapping the galex uv data .",
    "we require the optical data to provide more accurate positions for fibre spectroscopy and to refine our target selection .",
    "the optical data we use are from the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the ngp region and from the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) second red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the sgp region .    the wigglez survey area , illustrated in figure  [ figsurvey ] , is split into seven equatorial regions that sum to an area of 1000 deg@xmath6 , to facilitate year - round observing",
    "we require that each region should possess a minimum angular dimension of @xmath46 deg , corresponding to a spatial co - moving scale that exceeds by at least a factor of two the standard ruler preferred scale [ which projects to ( 8.5 , 4.6 , 3.2 , 2.6 ) deg at @xmath47 .",
    "the boundaries of the regions are listed in table  [ tab - survey ] .",
    "we have also defined high - priority sub - regions in each area ( see table  [ tab - surveyhigh ] ) which will be observed first to ensure that we have the maximum contiguous area surveyed should we be unable to observe the complete sample .",
    ".design of the observational programme [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     notes : the reliability fractions were obtained by comparing with repeated measurements at higher quality ( @xmath48 ) values .",
    "the measurement uncertainties @xmath49 were obtained by scaling the internal standard deviations by @xmath50 .",
    "the velocity differences for each measurement were calculated as @xmath51 .",
    "the comparisons of the repeat observations may also be used to check the internal redshift uncertainties @xmath52 for each measurement estimated by the runz code .",
    "those internal uncertainties have a median value of @xmath53 for all three quality bins combined , but the distribution is very non - uniform , with a long tail to higher values .",
    "considering just this median estimate of @xmath54 , we find that it corresponds well to the @xmath55 derived for the @xmath56 measurements in table  [ tab - redshift ] .",
    "the empirical results for the @xmath57 uncertainties in the table are larger than this , so in these cases the internal redshift uncertainty may be an underestimate .",
    "we also examined the redshift differences as a function of redshift , for all galaxies with multiple @xmath58 redshift measurements .",
    "we do not find any systematic variation with redshift of the mean or standard deviation of the differences .",
    "we conclude that the redshift uncertainties quoted above are valid over the entire redshift range of the wigglez survey .",
    "this is , however , a trend in the reliability of the @xmath59 redshift measurements : the reliability decreases from about 80 per cent to about 40 per cent between redshifts of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see fig .  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "at the time of writing , there are very few other galaxy surveys in our redshift range that overlap with the wigglez survey , so there are few opportunities for external comparison .",
    "there is a small overlap between wigglez and data release 3 of the deep2 survey @xcite in our 22-hour field .",
    "although the deep2 survey ( in that region ) is aimed at @xmath62 targets , there are 53 sources in common with wigglez ( positions matching to within 2.5 arc seconds ) .",
    "the estimated r.m.s .",
    "uncertainty in the deep2 redshifts is 30 with less than 5 per cent incorrectly identified @xcite .",
    "we compare the wigglez and deep2 redshifts in fig .",
    "[ fig - deep2 ] . of the 34 sources that both surveys assign good redshifts to",
    ", only 3 disagree substantially ( due to different line identifications ) . of the redshifts that disagree ,",
    "all three are @xmath59 wigglez measurements ; no @xmath63 or 5 wigglez measurements disagree with the deep2 measurements .",
    "on careful inspection of the wigglez spectra and the corresponding deep2 spectra we conclude that in two cases the deep2 value is correct ; the third case is ambiguous so we can not determine which is correct .",
    "this rate of misidentification among the @xmath59 wigglez redshifts ( 20 - 30% of the @xmath59 redshifts are wrong ) is entirely consistent with the internal estimates in section  [ sec - internal ] above .    restricting the sample to those that agree within @xmath64",
    ", there is no significant mean difference ( @xmath65 ) and the rms difference is @xmath66 ( 80.5 ) .",
    "this scatter is entirely consistent with the estimates of the internal uncertainties in the respective surveys quoted above .",
    "the primary aim of our project  measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale  can not be completed without the full data set .",
    "however there are many secondary scientific projects possible with the data currently available . in this section",
    "we describe some initial results from the current data sample .",
    "we focus on the properties of the measured galaxies , noting in particular the success of our methodology in selecting high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the whole wigglez survey strategy is based on the ability to select high - redshift emission - line galaxies for the spectroscopic observations .",
    "we initially selected galaxies based on the uv and uv - optical colours , but then improved the selection with optical colour selection to remove some of the low - redshift targets as described in section  [ sec - selection ] .",
    "the success of this strategy is demonstrated in figure  [ fig - selection ] by an increased fraction of high - redshift targets in both the sdss and rcs2 regions . in the sdss fields the median redshift increases from @xmath67 to @xmath68 . in the rcs2 fields ,",
    "the more accurate optical colours permit a greater improvement : the median redshift increases from @xmath69 to @xmath70 . in the combined sample",
    "the median redshift is @xmath71 and the redshift range containing 90 per cent of the galaxies is @xmath72 .",
    "the ability of the survey to obtain the required number of galaxies is also a function of the spectroscopic _ success rate _ , defined as the fraction of observations for which we obtain a reliable ( @xmath73 ) redshift . by comparison , the overall survey _ completeness _ is defined as the fraction of all the input targets for which we obtain a reliable ( @xmath74 ) redshift .",
    "the mean spectroscopic success rate for the survey so far is 60 per cent ( table  [ tab - design ] ) ; the completeness ( after the repeated observations ) is 70 per cent .",
    "longer exposures would enable a higher success rate and better quality spectra but would result in greatly diminished values for the total area and total number of galaxies covered and hence a poorer bao measurement .",
    "the main factor that strongly affects the success rate is the weather : it drops by around 20 per cent when observations are taken through cloud .",
    "( in the first half of the survey , 57 per cent of the allocated time was clear and we observed through cloud for an additional 9 per cent of the time . ) in figure  [ fig - completeness ] we show that the success rate is not a strong function of the continuum @xmath75 magnitude .",
    "this is expected as we are measuring the redshifts from emission lines and not from continuum features .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - completeness ] shows the distribution of @xmath75 magnitudes for the targets : this shows steps at half - magnitude intervals due to our prioritization scheme ( see table  [ tab - priority ] ) .",
    "we will examine the physical properties of the wigglez galaxies in detail in later papers , but some preliminary observations can be made at this stage .",
    "the wigglez galaxy sample clearly favours blue galaxies with strong emission lines as a result of the primary nuv flux limit and the @xmath76 colour selection .",
    "this selection has been quantified by our analysis of deep2 @xcite galaxies for which deep optical and galex observations were available .",
    "( see section  [ sec - selection ] ) .",
    "we find that , as expected , the wigglez targets are blue compared to optically - selected galaxies : 82 ( 99 ) per cent of the wigglez targets are bluer than @xmath77 ( 1.8 ) .",
    "we have investigated the physical morphology of the wigglez galaxies by searching the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "archive for any images that are available of the wigglez galaxies we have observed .",
    "we present a selection of these images in figure  [ fig - morphology ] .",
    "the images show that a very large fraction of the wigglez galaxies are interacting or show other signs of a disturbed morphology .",
    "this suggests that merger activity may play an important role in driving the strong star formation detected in the wigglez galaxies . in terms of the galaxy photometry",
    ", we also note that about 25 per cent of the images reveal more than one galaxy within the @xmath78 arc second psf of galex . in these cases",
    "the uv photometry may include both sources whereas the optical measurements may include only one of the sources .",
    "the most direct physical measurement we have for each wigglez galaxy is from the various emission lines in the spectra , notably [ oii ] which is the one line present in nearly all spectra . at low redshifts ( @xmath79 for the old dichroic and @xmath80 for the new dichroic ) ,",
    "both h@xmath81 and h@xmath82 are also visible .",
    "this is below the median redshift range for the survey , but it does provide a sub - sample of galaxies for which we can investigate the line diagnostics . in fig .",
    "[ fig - bpt ] we show the `` bpt '' @xcite line ratio diagnostic plot for low - redshift galaxies in our sample .",
    "note that the two lines in each ratio ( [ oiii]/h@xmath81 and [ nii]/h@xmath82 ) are at very similar wavelengths , so the plot can be constructed from spectra that have not been flux calibrated .",
    "we also show in the figure the `` maximal star formation '' boundary line @xcite between the star formation ( below the line ) and the active galaxy ( above the line ) domains .",
    "the plot shows most ( 90 per cent ) of the wigglez galaxies fall below the nominal boundary line , confirming that we are mainly selecting star - forming galaxies as intended .",
    "we can also use the [ oiii]/h@xmath81 line ratio to show that the higher redshift targets are not dominated by agn . in figure  [ fig - bpt2 ]",
    "we compare the distributions of the [ oiii]/h@xmath81 line ratio for galaxies above and below a redshift of @xmath83 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the high redshift galaxies do not have any large excess with high line ratios , indicative of agn . in the low redshift sample that we analysed in figure  [ fig - bpt ] ,",
    "the fraction with log@xmath84[oiii]/h@xmath85 is 1 per cent , compared to 2 per cent for the galaxies at higher redshifts ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we show an example of the spatial distribution of the wigglez galaxies from the 15-hour field as cone plots projected onto the right ascension plane in figure  [ fig - cone ] .",
    "the large - scale radial features in the plots are due to the incomplete coverage of the survey at present . in the remaining regions of the plots ,",
    "especially the lower plot , some evidence of spatial clustering is revealed by visual inspection .",
    "this is in contrast to similar plots for the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite and the 2slaq luminous redshift galaxy survey @xcite , both of which show strong evidence of clustering in similar diagrams .",
    "this difference is expected because the wigglez galaxies are comparatively rarer objects with much larger median separations than the other samples .",
    "furthermore , we are surveying much larger spatial scales .",
    "the distribution of wigglez galaxies probes clustering on 100mpc scales where it is weaker than on the much smaller scales probed by , for example , the 2dfgrs .",
    "although the wigglez galaxies are not as strongly clustered as red galaxies , their intrinsic small - scale clustering strength is a crucial design parameter for the main wigglez survey .",
    "we have used the early survey data to measure this small scale clustering .",
    "we find that the clustering is actually much stronger than that measured previously for uv - selected galaxies at low redshifts ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "we measure a clustering length of @xmath88 mpc @xcite .",
    "this is comparable to the lyman break galaxies measured in high redshift ( @xmath89 ) surveys ; the combined flux limits and colour selection of the wigglez survey are selecting extremely luminous blue galaxies that are relatively strongly clustered .",
    "this is highly advantageous for our survey design , as discussed above .",
    "we have estimated the final precision of the survey in measuring the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath10 assuming a model with constant @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we include the 5-year wmap cosmic microwave background data @xcite and the latest supernova data from the snls , _ hst _ and essence projects @xcite to predict marginalised errors in our model of @xmath8 and @xmath90 .",
    "not only is this more precise than previous estimates , but the method is independent and eliminates existing degeneracy in the ( @xmath91 ) plane ( see fig .  20 of * ? ? ?",
    "we have also measured the three - dimensional power spectrum of the wigglez galaxies on large scales .",
    "we find that a model power spectrum based on linear theory is a good fit to the data over a wide range of scales up to a maximum wave number of @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the fit extends to such large wave numbers because of the high redshifts of the wigglez galaxies and their relatively low bias .",
    "we also detect the imprint of peculiar velocities when comparing the power spectrum measurements as a function of radial and tangential wave numbers : the results are consistent with a redshift space distortion parameter of @xmath39 .",
    "this paper accompanies the first public data release from the wigglez survey , made at the half - way point in terms of allocated observing nights . in this section",
    "we summarise the current status of the survey and give details of the survey database design and the first public data release .      at the end of the 2008a observing semester",
    ", the wigglez survey reached its half - way point in terms of scheduled nights on the telescope ( see table  [ tab - dates ] ) : 112 of a nominal 220 nights had been scheduled .",
    "several improvements were made to the survey design parameters in the first twelve months as a result of the initial observations , but the design and performance are now stable .",
    "the key parameters of the survey performance are summarised in table  [ tab - design ] .",
    "the first part of the table lists the various parameters we obtain for the survey which , when multiplied together give us the rate of galaxies successfully observed per clear night . in the second half of the table",
    "we calculate the length of the survey needed in order to observe the 240,000 galaxies we need for the clustering measurements .",
    "this comes to about 160 clear nights , corresponding to 220 nights when we include the standard factor of 1.33 to allow for bad weather .",
    "as noted above , the total number of survey galaxies required to be observed is a function of the target selection and the observational success rate .",
    "other factors such as the number of fibres allocated per field and the number of fields observed per night also enter into the calculation which is summarised in table  [ tab - design ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig - progress ] we present the actual results of the observations graphically , showing the cumulative number of survey galaxies successfully observed as a function of the number of clear nights used .",
    "this is compared to the required rate of 1442 survey galaxies per clear night to reach 240,000 galaxies in the full survey . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "the survey is almost on schedule to achieve this goal .",
    "the wigglez survey is a complex , multi - year campaign involving the collection of many nights of observational data .",
    "thus a sophisticated , reliable data archiving system is an absolute necessity .",
    "our general approach is to take the raw and reduced data , observational logs , catalogue and other associated files and organize them within a well defined directory structure on a large cluster server .",
    "an extensive suite of software has been developed ( by nj ) to serve the data from this archive via a mysql database and `` ruby on rails '' web application .",
    "python scripts have also been built to assist in the data uploading , checking and management of the archive .",
    "the web application gives access to data subsets using a simple search interface which allows queries based on the observation dates , target identifiers , regions in the sky , filter bandpasses , redshift range and other parameters , or some combination thereof .",
    "all these parameters for the large number of targets have been captured in the database .",
    "users can also execute more complex , custom sql queries on the database via the web application .",
    "catalogues of targets , and the associated fits files of the reduced spectra , can be downloaded for analysis . finally , users of the web application can also upload catalogues of objects to be cross - matched against targets currently residing in the wigglez data archive .    the wigglez web application and database have been designed to capture all the pertinent data regarding the observations so that we can analyze our large data set with as many approaches as possible , thus maximizing the scientific return .",
    "the web application is very user - friendly and well documented , such that a novice user can soon execute complex queries of the database with minimal training .",
    "a cookbook of possible web application uses is provided along with visual explanations of the various features .",
    "since the web application has the flexibility of allowing both simple searches and more complex , custom sql queries , users can mine the database for the specific results that they seek .",
    "after a successful query of the database the user can then use the search results page to : select and view an individual spectrum , select ( sub-)sets of resultant targets for download as a tar file of fits spectra files or as a catalog file ( in ascii , votable or fits format ) . when viewing an individual spectrum from a search , the associated galex and optical images of the target ( when either are available ) are displayed , and the user has the capability of zooming in on the spectrum , applying gaussian smoothing and downloading hard copy files ( in fits or postscript format ) .",
    "the web application also allows a user to upload a space - separated ascii file containing ra and dec positions of targets , to cross - match this list with targets in the wigglez database .",
    "the results of the cross - matching can be downloaded in the form of either ascii , votable or fits table catalogues , or as a tar file of fits files containing the spectra . finally , download requests of selected spectra or catalogues from the search results page results in the user being redirected to the `` pending requests '' page . on this web page , multiple queries by a user can be left pending and downloaded at a later time .",
    "the first public release of wigglez data ( dr1 ) aims to provide the astronomical community with an opportunity to utilize our large data archive well before the survey is complete and before the final , complete data release .",
    "this first data release is available via the following url : http://wigglez.swin.edu.au/. this web page does not require secure access and is available to any user who wants to access the dr1 data .",
    "the wigglez dr1 database provides the target coordinates , photometry and redshifts , along with the quality of the determined redshifts , downloadable in ascii , votable and fits table format .",
    "it should be emphasized that the dr1 targets will also have their fits spectra files publicly accessible via the website .",
    "we have included the uv and optical magnitudes for all of the targets in dr1 , where available .",
    "the dr1 public data release includes all observations up to the end of semester 2008a : a total of 169,000 spectra with 100,138 successful redshift measurements .",
    "the median redshift is @xmath36 and the redshift range containing 90 per cent of the galaxies is @xmath15 .",
    "the wigglez dark energy survey will be the first large - volume spectroscopic galaxy survey to measure the bao scale in the key redshift range of @xmath93 . in this paper",
    "we have described the design and initial results of the wigglez survey at the half - way point which coincides with our first public data release .    to emphasise the large size of the wigglez survey we note that , as of 2008 december",
    ", we have measured 119,000 galaxy redshifts , of which 73 000 have redshifts @xmath62 .",
    "this means we have already more than doubled the number of known galaxy redshifts above @xmath94 from the two largest existing surveys : deep2 @xcite with @xmath95 and the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with @xmath96 .",

    "our survey design relies on the use of galex uv satellite data to efficiently select high - redshift emission line galaxies . these objects ,",
    "whilst fainter than giant red galaxies at the same redshift , can be observed very efficiently on a 4-metre class telescope because of their strong emission lines .",
    "we have added some optical colour selection to our uv colour selection to further improve the fraction of galaxies with high redshifts ; the median redshift of the measured galaxies is now @xmath71 .",
    "the high sensitivity of the new aaomega spectrograph on the aat and the short fibre configuration time of the 2df positioner mean that we can observe a new field every 1.2 hours allowing us to make rapid progress on the survey .    in this paper",
    "we have also presented our first public data release , available from a dedicated web interface .",
    "the public data comprise photometry ( optical and uv ) , redshifts and spectra of all objects observed up to the end of semester 2008a .",
    "we can not make the bao clustering measurement at this stage of the project .",
    "this is not only because we only have half the necessary sample but also because the window function is very irregular due to our highly variable coverage of the fields to date .",
    "however , at the half - way stage we already have the largest ever sample of high redshift emission line galaxy spectra .",
    "most importantly , we have measured the small - scale clustering of these uv - luminous galaxies and found it to be relatively strong which increases the accuracy with which we will be able to measure the bao scale . at lower redshifts where we can measure the h@xmath81 line we have shown that the wigglez galaxies are mostly extreme starburst - type galaxies as expected .",
    "we have compared the wigglez galaxies to optically - selected galaxies at the same redshift and confirmed that they are extremely blue with high star formation rates .",
    "there is some evidence from _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "imaging of a subset of the galaxies that the starburst activity is being driven by interactions .",
    "this project would not be possible without the superb aaomega/2df facility provided by the anglo - australian observatory .",

    "<S> the wigglez dark energy survey is a survey of 240,000 emission line galaxies in the distant universe , measured with the aaomega spectrograph on the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) . </S>",
    "<S> the primary aim of the survey is to precisely measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) imprinted on the spatial distribution of these galaxies at look - back times of 48gyrs .    the target galaxies are selected using ultraviolet photometry from the galex satellite , with a flux limit of @xmath0 mag . </S>",
    "<S> we also require that the targets are detected at optical wavelengths , specifically in the range @xmath1mag . </S>",
    "<S> we use the lyman break method applied to the ultraviolet colours , with additional optical colour limits , to select high - redshift galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies generally have strong emission lines , permitting reliable redshift measurements in relatively short exposure times on the aat . </S>",
    "<S> the median redshift of the galaxies is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift range containing 90% of the galaxies is @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the survey will sample a volume of @xmath41gpc@xmath5 over a projected area on the sky of 1,000 degree@xmath6 , with an average target density of 350degree@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> detailed forecasts indicate the survey will measure the bao scale to better than 2% and the tangential and radial acoustic wave scales to approximately 3% and 5% , respectively . combining the wigglez constraints with existing cosmic microwave background measurements and the latest supernova data , the marginalized uncertainties in the cosmological model </S>",
    "<S> are expected to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( for a constant @xmath10 model ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wigglez measurement of @xmath10 will constitute a robust , precise and independent test of dark energy models .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper provides a detailed description of the survey and its design , as well as the spectroscopic observations , data reduction , and redshift measurement techniques employed . </S>",
    "<S> it also presents an analysis of the properties of the target galaxies , including emission line diagnostics which show that they are mostly extreme starburst galaxies , and _ hubble space telescope _ images , which show they contain a high fraction of interacting or distorted systems . in conjunction with this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we make a public data release of data for the first 100,000 galaxies measured for the project .    </S>",
