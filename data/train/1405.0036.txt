    "the internal structure of sunspots has been an enduring question in solar physics .",
    "two competing scenarios have been proposed several decades ago , the so - called `` monolithic sunspot '' and the `` spaghetti sunspot '' , but still there is no definitive evidence which can end the debate and prove one of the models wrong .",
    "the monolithic model @xcite considers the sunspot magnetic field as approximately homogeneous below the visible solar surface . due to some difficulties of this model to explain several solar phenomena , for example umbral dots , @xcite proposed an alternative model assuming that the sunspot is composed of a group of many magnetic flux tubes bundled together , the so - called spaghetti model .",
    "this model naturally explains umbral dots as the signature of the field - free hot gas surrounding the flux tubes .",
    "however , several works ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have claimed that umbral dots can be included in the monolithic model as the result of magnetoconvection .",
    "the analysis of umbral dots through direct observations of the solar photosphere using high - resolution stokes polarimetry has not been able to discern between these two models @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a substantial development in realistic three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of sunspots , including radiative transfer and a realistic equation of state @xcite .",
    "these simulations show over time a significant fragmentation of the subsurface magnetic field even if they are started from a monolithic initial state .",
    "most major fragmentations become visible at the photosphere .",
    "@xcite suggests that sunspots without light bridges are more monolithic than those which present light bridges and signs of flux separation .",
    "indirect observations of the solar interior by means of the interpretation of the acoustic wave field in and around sunspots seem to be the most promising approach to unveil the subsurface structure of sunspots .",
    "the papers by @xcite have proven the strong interaction of the @xmath2modes with solar magnetic fields .",
    "they found that sunspots can absorb up to half of the incident @xmath2modes power .",
    "the absorption and scattering phase shift produced by sunspots show a dependence with the frequency , degree , radial order , and azimuthal order @xcite . in order to use this information to interpret the properties of magnetic structures ,",
    "it is necessary to develop theoretical models for the interaction of waves with magnetic fields .",
    "ideally , these models will reveal some differences in the way that acoustic waves interact with monolithic and spaghetti models , indicating which solar observations can distinguish between the two scenarios .",
    "mode conversion @xcite is the most promising mechanism to explain the observed absorption in sunspots .",
    "it occurs because in magnetized regions the slow and fast wave modes are coupled and can exchange energy , especially around the height where the sound and alfvn speeds are similar . below this height",
    "the sound speed greatly exceeds the alfvn speed , and the fast , slow , and alfvn waves are decoupled . in these deep layers",
    "the fast wave is similar to an acoustic wave in non - magnetic regions , while the slow and alfvn modes are incompressive waves which travel along field lines .",
    "according to the mode conversion hypothesis , absorption is produced by the conversion of incident @xmath2modes into these waves in magnetized regions , which propagate downward extracting energy from the acoustic cavity .",
    "@xcite showed that mode conversion produced by vertical magnetic fields can account for the absorption of @xmath3modes , but in order to explain the absorption of @xmath2modes it is necessary to include inclined magnetic fields @xcite .    in the case of thin flux tubes",
    ", it is well established that they can support sausage and kink modes @xcite .",
    "these tube waves are excited by the interaction of the flux tube with the incident acoustic waves , and they travel upward or downward removing energy from the @xmath2modes @xcite .",
    "several works @xcite evaluated the absorption produced by isolated thin flux tubes . however , following the hypothesis of the spaghetti model , sunspots are composed by bundles of these elements .",
    "@xcite realized the relevance of multiple scattering to account for the interaction of sound waves with groups of flux tubes , and analyzed pairs of flux tubes in unstratifed atmospheres .",
    "@xcite found that spaghetti sunspots are much more efficient absorbers than monolithic models , and the study of @xcite of pairs of flux tubes in gravitationally stratifed atmospheres supports their results .",
    "recently , @xcite evaluated the scattering of the @xmath0 mode produced by groups of flux tubes , and found that multiple scattering tends to increase the absorption and reduce the phase shift , while @xcite obtained that a loose cluster of tubes is a more efficient absorber than a compact cluster or an equivalent monolithic tube .",
    "as of today , no study has analyzed the scattering produced by a sufficient number of tubes to construct a model comparable to actual sunspots .",
    "however , this is now feasible thanks to numerical simulations .",
    "the objective of this paper is to compare the seismic response produced by spaghetti models with that obtained for monolithic sunspots .",
    "as discussed previously , the mechanisms that produce the absorption in these two cases may be different . on the one hand , for the thick flux tube representative of monolithic sunspots , fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves are strongly coupled around the region where the sound and alfvn speed are similar , and slow magnetic modes extract energy from the incident acoustic waves .",
    "on other hand , in the case of spaghetti sunspots , the absorption is produced by the excitation of tube waves in the constituent flux tubes and enhanced by multiple scattering . in this work ,",
    "we do not attempt to identify the wave modes that generate the absorption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we aim to find some differences in the measurements obtained from these two distinct magnetic field configurations , which could be used as a constraint to discern between these models .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section [",
    "sect : numerical ] we present the numerical simulations and the sunspot models",
    ". section [ sect : wavefield ] describes the wavefields produced by both sunspots . in the next two sections we discuss the results of the helioseismic measurements",
    "performed , including the travel - time shift ( section [ sect : traveltimes ] ) and fourier - hankel analysis ( section [ sect : hankel ] ) , while in section [ sect : mode_mixing ] we evaluate the mode - mixing .",
    "finally , the conclusions of these results are found in section [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "mhd simulations were carried out using the mancha code @xcite .",
    "we used two different magnetohydrostatic backgrounds .",
    "the monolithic sunspot was constructed following @xcite .",
    "the photospheric magnetic field at the axis of the spot is 1500 g. it smoothly decreases with radius , and at 12 mm from the center of the sunspot the magnetic field vanishes and the atmosphere corresponds to csm_b quiet sun model @xcite .",
    "the spaghetti sunspot is composed by a bundle of 1663 identical flux tubes inside a circle with radius of 10.7 mm , with a minimum distance between the center of the tubes of 0.5 mm .",
    "figure [ fig : tubos_pos ] shows the distribution of the 19 tubes closest to the center of the sunspot as an example . the same pattern is repeated until filling the whole area of the sunspot .",
    "each individual tube model is taken from @xcite . within a radius of 0.1 mm",
    "they have a photospheric magnetic field strength of 2500 g and small variations in the thermodynamic variables . in the next 0.1 mm the magnetic field",
    "is reduced to zero .",
    "the atmosphere surrounding the tubes also corresponds to csm_b .",
    "the number of tubes was selected in order to match the photospheric magnetic flux of the monolithic model .",
    "figure [ fig : velocities_b_models ] shows a comparison of the characteristic velocities and magnetic field between both sunspot models .",
    "the monolithic sunspot has a wilson depression with a reduction of the sound speed in the inner region of the sunspot .",
    "the spaghetti model lacks a wilson depression .",
    "all the flux tubes in the spaghetti model , from the axis of the sunspot to the outer radial distances , have the same variation in thermodynamic variables , and do not produce a significant modification of the sound speed .",
    "the top panel also shows that in the deeper layers the alfvn speed at the axis of one of the flux tubes of the spaghetti model is higher than that on the axis of the monolithic sunspot . on the other hand , around the photosphere the alfvn speed of the monolithic sunspot",
    "greatly exceeds that of the flux tubes due to the decrease of the density produced by the wilson depression .",
    "the figure also reveals the differences in the distribution of the magnetic field between the sunspot models . in order to illustrate a meaningful comparison between the whole picture of both sunspots , in the case of the spaghetti model",
    "we have plotted a constant magnetic field inside the radius of the sunspot which generates the same magnetic flux of the model , instead of an alternation of small regions with high magnetic flux ( flux tubes ) and with no magnetic flux ( magnetic - free regions between tubes ) .",
    "the alfvn speed of the spaghetti sunspot from the middle panels was obtained using this uniform distribution of the magnetic field . in this work",
    "we neither aim to study realistic sunspot models nor reproduce observations .",

    "both the monolithic and spaghetti sunspots illustrate some of the well known properties of the interaction between waves and solar magnetic structures @xcite : firstly , the region of the wavefront which passes through the sunspot is shifted forward in space , since the waves travel faster in the magnetized atmosphere ; secondly , the amplitude of those waves is significantly reduced inside the sunspot , and it remains smaller just behind the spot . the scattering wave @xmath12 is obtained as the difference between the simulation with the sunspot being present and the equivalent quiet sun simulation .",

    "observational works usually compute the travel time using the cross - correlation between the signal measured at two points of the solar surface . in our simulations",

    "is reduced the scattered wave becomes more circular @xcite , and its energy is distributed in a wavefront whose size increases with the distance and , thus , its amplitude decreases .",

    "the same conclusion can be extracted from the examination of the curvature of the scattered wave ( figure [ fig : scattering_p1 ] ) .",

    "we introduce individual wave packets with fixed radial order as initial condition ( either @xmath0 or @xmath1 modes ) , the power in the scattered waves in other radial orders must come from the mode - mixing from the radial order of the incident wave .",
    "we have filtered the vertical velocity wavefields in order to isolate the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 modes in the frequency range between 3 and 4 mhz .",
    "figures [ fig : mixing_f ] and [ fig : mixing_p1 ] show maps of the filtered scattered waves produced by mode - mixing in the monolithic and spaghetti scenarios .",
    "the magnitude of the oscillations in these maps has been divided by the maximum amplitude of the filtered incident wave ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes , respectively ) in the quiet sun reference simulation at the same time step in order to provide an approximation of what fraction of the incident wave is converted to a different radial order .",
    "figure [ fig : mixing_f ] shows the mode - mixing produced from the @xmath0 mode ( @xmath50 ) to higher order @xmath76 modes , from @xmath1 to @xmath70 .",
    "there is a significant amount of mode - mixing from @xmath0 to @xmath1 mode , but its efficiency rapidly drops for @xmath77 greater or equal to 2 .",
    "the amplitude of the scattered @xmath69 is almost an order of magnitude lower than that of @xmath1 , and for @xmath70 it is even smaller .",
    "a comparison of mode - mixing produced by the monolithic and spaghetti sunspots shows remarkable differences",
    ". this may be a way to distinguish monolithic and spaghetti models for sunspots . in the case of @xmath0 to @xmath1 scattering ( @xmath78 )",
    ", the monolithic model generates a two times higher amplitude scattered wave .",
    "the @xmath0 to @xmath69 mode - mixing ( @xmath79 ) is similar for both sunspots , but the amplitude of the @xmath70 mode ( @xmath80 ) scattered by the spaghetti sunspot is also significantly lower , being barely distinguishable from the background .    with regards to the mode - mixing from an incident @xmath1 mode ( figure [ fig : mixing_p1 ] ) , the most efficient scattering corresponds to @xmath78 , that is , to the scattering from @xmath1 to @xmath69 .",
    "the amplitude of scattered waves produced by mode - mixing with @xmath81 and @xmath79 is smaller . in a similar fashion to the @xmath50 case",
    ", the monolithic sunspot also produces a notable higher amount of mode - mixing in comparison to the spaghetti model . for all @xmath82 analyzed ,",
    "the amplitude of the scattered wave produced by the monolithic model is around 3 times higher than that of the spaghetti sunspot .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the scattering produced by the interaction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes with two different sunspot models : monolithic and spaghetti sunspots .",
    "although our simple models do not account for the full complexity of solar magnetic structures , they retain the basic properties that characterize each kind of sunspot model .",
    "our work is a first step to a qualitatively understanding of the differences in the seismic response between both models , rather than a quest for an agreement with observational measurements .",
    "we have evaluated the wave interaction with the model magnetic structures by means of the analysis of the wavefield as well as performing local helioseismic measurements , including travel - time shift maps and fourier - hankel analysis .",
    "the results reveal some differences in the seismic signature of those sunspot models :    \\1 .",
    "the wavefront of the waves scattered by the monolithic sunspot has more curvature , while the waves scattered by the spaghetti sunspot are more flat ( figures [ fig : scattering_f ] and [ fig : scattering_p1 ] ) .",
    "\\2 . behind the sunspot",
    ", the spaghetti sunspot produces approximately constant phase shift for all the @xmath13 positions where the flux tubes are present , while the magnitude of the travel time shift generated by the monolithic model is higher behind the center of the sunspot ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : traveltime_plot_f ] ) .",
    "the travel time shift produced by the monolithic sunspot peaks closer to the axis of the spot than the travel time shift produced by the spaghetti model ( top panel of figure [ fig : traveltime_plot_p1 ] ) .",
    "the variation of the phase shift with @xmath14 produced by the spaghetti sunspot between @xmath23 and @xmath66 is steeper than that of the monolithic sunspot ( figures [ fig : phase_f_m ] and [ fig : phase_p1_m ] ) .",
    "these differences suggest that helioseismology techniques could distinguish between the sunspot models analyzed in this work . however , our aim is to find a measurement that can detect above the noise level the properties that are inherent of the sunspot model type ( monolithic or spaghetti ) .",
    "the differences listed from 1 to 4 suggest that the horizontal extent of the scattering region of the monolithic sunspot is smaller than that of the spaghetti model .",
    "those results agree with the fact that in the monolithic sunspot the magnetic field is stronger at the axis of the sunspot and decreases with the radius , while in the case of the spaghetti model the flux tubes are uniformly distributed inside a 10.7 mm radius ( figure [ fig : velocities_b_models ] ) .",
    "this way , points 1 to 4 probably can not be used to discern between monolithic and spaghetti sunspots .",
    "nevertheless , the coherence among all these measurements and the characteristics of the sunspot models serves as a sanity check of the calculations .    regarding points number 5 ,",
    "previous studies of the scattering produced by bundles of flux tubes have pointed out that multiple scattering enhances the absorption @xcite .",
    "those works are restricted to a small number of flux tubes .",
    "our simulations of the spaghetti sunspot model account for a realistic number of flux tubes for the first time .",
    "the stronger efficiency of the monolithic model at low @xmath14 values constrasts with the results suggested by earlier work .",
    "it must be noted that in this paper we are comparing different magnetic structures . in our monolithic sunspot",
    "the absorption is produced by the conversion of the incident acoustic waves into field guided magnetoacoustic modes ( slow , fast , or alfvn ) , whereas for the spaghetti sunspot the absorption is caused by the excitation of tube waves ( for further discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "the differences in the absorption between the two sunspot models at @xmath14 values below 1000 ( figures [ fig : absorption_f_l ] and [ fig : absorption_p1_l ] ) can be detected above the observational noise level if the signal to noise is increased by averaging over azimuthal orders @xcite .",
    "the recent work by @xcite shows the absorption coefficient for 15 sunspots and reveals substantial differences among them .",
    "this result suggests that the differences in the absorption coefficient between sunspots of the same kind ( monolithic or spaghetti ) may be higher than those obtained between the two models analyzed in this work .",
    "furthermore , the individual properties of each sunspot , regarding size and magnetic field strength , may produce a stronger influence on the absorption than the nature of the subsurface magnetic structure .",
    "one way to proceed in the future consists of combining helioseismic measurements with direct polarimetric observations in order to set some constraints on the absorption expected from the observed magnetic flux .    as we listed in point number 6 , the measured mode - mixing shows differences between both models .",
    "the absorption coefficient provides a measure of the power lost by an specific mode ( with radial order @xmath49 , frequency @xmath72 , degree @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , not all this power corresponds to a real absorption produced by magnetic field guided waves that extract energy from the acoustic cavity .",
    "if there is a significant amount of mode - mixing , part of the energy is also scattered to other wave modes with different radial order @xmath71 and degree @xmath83 , but with the same frequency since the sunspot is stable .",
    "the evaluation of mode - mixing in both sunspot models indicates that a remarkable amount of power is scattered to other radial orders , particularly for @xmath78 and for an incident @xmath0 mode , and that the mode - mixing generated by the monolithic sunspot is up to 3 times higher than that of the spaghetti model .",
    "recently , @xcite have observationally obtained the scattered wavefunctions from @xmath49 to another radial order @xmath71 .",
    "the relation between this kind of measurements and the absorption coefficient might be a valuable criterion to discern between monolithic and spaghetti scenarios .",
    "the phase shift measurements show some of the most noticeable differences between both models , listed as numbers 7 and 8 .",
    "on the one hand , the spaghetti sunspot produces negative phase shifts at high @xmath34 values . for the @xmath1 mode",
    ", these negative phase shifts appear at @xmath54 and @xmath66 , while in the case of the @xmath0 mode they are obvious at @xmath23 and slightly visible at @xmath54 . on the other hand ,",
    "the comparison of the magnitude of the phase shift between both models depends on the mode and @xmath14 value considered . at @xmath14 below 1200",
    "the phase shift of the monolithic model is generally higher , except the @xmath0 mode at @xmath59 and the @xmath1 mode at @xmath54 .",
    "however , at higher @xmath14 the phase shift produced by the spaghetti sunspot is significanly higher for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes .",
    "@xcite found that multiple scattering tends to reduce the phase shift , and according to @xcite the extent of the region of influence of the near field is @xmath84 .",
    "since the spaghetti sunspot shows a steep phase shift enhacement at higher @xmath14 values ( lower wavelengths ) , our results point out that for the longer wavelengths the phase shift of the spaghetti sunspot is reduced due to multiple scattering effects , while at shorter wavelengths the reduction of the relevance of those effects generates a sudden increase in the phase shift .",
    "this way , the variation of the phase shift as a function of @xmath14 ( wavelength ) also provides a hint to distinguish between the models .",
    "note that the difference in the @xmath14 dependence of the phase shifts between the spaghetti and monolithic models is also affected by the depth dependence of the two models .",
    "higher @xmath14 waves are sensitive to shallower regions of the atmosphere .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : velocities_b_models ] , around the photosphere the sound speed of the monolithic model is reduced , while our spaghetti sunspot does not account for a realistic wilson depression .",
    "the work by @xcite has evaluated the effects of the cooling of the umbral subphotosphere on the travel - time shifts , finding that the wilson depression produces a reduction of the travel - time , while @xcite have assessed the sensitivity of travel - times to the wilson depression .",
    "the development of magnetohydrostatic spaghetti sunspot models with a realistic wilson depression is a challenging problem .",
    "one possible way to proceed in the future is to construct such models by extracting their properties from magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of sunspots @xcite , and experimenting with bottom boundary conditions that produce spaghetti - like configurations for the subsurface magnetic field .",
    "the differences in the depth dependence and magnetic field inclination also affect mode - mixing @xcite .",
    "while the magnetic field of the monolithic sunspot spreads with height , with its inclination increasing with the radial distance , the fluxtubes from the spaghetti model are almost vertical .",
    "this difference may contribute to the lower efficience of mode - mixing in the spaghetti sunspot .",
    "the depth dependence and the inclination of the magnetic field are not necessarily a consequence of the type of sunspot model , and calls attention to be cautious with using the variation of the phase shift with @xmath14 and the mode - mixing measurements to discern between monolithic and spaghetti sunspot scenarios .",
    "some limitations hinder our ability to make meaningful comparisons of the presented results and actual solar observations .",
    "several published studies of the absorption and phase shift produced by sunspots are restricted to @xmath14 lower than 600 @xcite , while our analysis focuses on higher @xmath14 values . in order to extend our results to those low @xmath14 values",
    ", it is necessary to perform the simulations using bigger horizontal computational domains and increase the annular region used for the hankel analysis .",
    "measurements at higher @xmath14 values show a decrease in the absorption for @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "observations are affected by background convective ( or instrumental ) noise and finite lifetime effects , but we made no attempt to include those features in the numerical calculations .",
    "future simulations should also study higher order @xmath76 modes and examine more detailed sunspot models , especially in the case of the spaghetti sunspot .",
    "we have used the same vertical flux tube all over the sunspot region .",
    "improved models should account for the radial variation of the magnetic flux inside the sunspot , the wilson depression , and also include a variety of flux tubes with different radius , magnetic field strengths , and inclinations .",
