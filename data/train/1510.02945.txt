    "einstein s gravitational theory , general relativity , `` is largely accepted as the best description of the gravitation interaction available today .",
    "apart from classical test dated back to the beginning of the last century , the main expectation for measuring genuine general relativistic effects come from gravitational waves , a direct measure of which would be the final sought for validation of theory .",
    "however , for this , earth - based interferometers like ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite , are raising more and more their sensitivity , and there is a moderate optimistic perspective to observe gravitational wave signals in the next forthcoming years , especially those associated with coalescence scenarios in binary systems , i.e. , from strong gravitational field '' phenomena .    in the weak gravitational field ,",
    "\" instead , general relativity enters only as a small modification of the newtonian gravity , i.e. , it constitutes an approximation of the full theory . commonly used approximation schemes are 1 ) the so - called post - netwonian ( pn ) approximation which incorporates corrections to the flat minkowski spacetime from a series expansion in powers of @xmath0 ( also called a `` slow - motion approximation '' ) , where @xmath1 denotes the speed of light in vacuum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; recently pn has been improved by the effective - one - body ( eob ) formalism , when dealing with binary systems @xcite ) ; 2 ) the so - called post - minkowskian ( pm ) approximation which incorporates corrections to the flat minkowski spacetime from a series expansion in powers of @xmath2 ( also called a `` fast - motion approximation '' ) , where @xmath2 denotes the gravitational constant .    among the advantages to operate in the far- or weak - field regime",
    "is that one can still consider the gravitational theory as a linear `` analogous of electromagnetism and , as a consequence , discuss most of the gravitational phenomena according to their electromagnetic counterpart .",
    "this very useful formalism , termed gravitoelectromagnetism , '' ( gem ) @xcite is not a at all a new theory , but only a convenient language to re - express gravitation in a form which may be of some utility for what concerns our intuition .",
    "for example , introducing properly gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields , one can discuss test particle motion ( i.e. , geodesic motion ) as being ( locally ) a motion in presence of an external force , the latter formally represented by the gem analogue of the lorentz force .    without entering the details of the general gem approach ( which can even applied in the full exact theory  @xcite and not only in its linearizations , or even at the newtonian level ) ,",
    "we limit our considerations here to the case of linear gravitoelectromagnetism `` @xcite , which involves a pm approximation scheme ( namely , it works at linear order in @xmath2 ) . in this context , we explore here the role of corrections to the lorentz gravitoelectromagnetic force due to a time - varying gravitomagnetic vector potential .",
    "as we will show below , such corrections are represented by an acceleration contribution constituting the analogous of the induction law in electromagnetism , which we term as gravitational induction '' acceleration term . here ,",
    "more specifically , we will evaluate the contribution of the single nontrivial gravitational induction term on the mean orbital motion of a test particle , in the case of a gravitational field generated by a localized and slowly rotating astronomical source .",
    "let us consider the spacetime generated by a localized and slowly rotating astronomical source , referred to cartesian - like coordinate system @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the linear approximation , the spacetime metric generated by such a source can be written as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the minkowski metric ( with signature @xmath8 , according to the convention used here ) and @xmath9 is a first - order perturbation , often re - expressed by its trace - reverse counterpart @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known that imposing the lorenz ( or transverse \" ) gauge condition @xmath12 , the gravitational field equations can cast in the form [ eq:1 ] |h_=-t _  . the general solution of ( [ eq:1 ] )",

    "denoting by @xmath17 and @xmath18 the mass and the angular momentum of the source , respectively , the gem potentials ( in the region far from the source , characterized by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ) can be expressed as [ eq:4 ] = , =  .",
    "note that the above choice of @xmath22 is fully consistent with the pm approximation of gr ; differently , working in the pn approximation this choice would not be fully consistent even at 1pn and",
    "one should include additional terms @xcite , i.e. = ( 1 + ) + o ( ) . however , as stated above , @xmath23 terms are not considered here .",
    "the gauge condition @xmath12 implies that [ eq:5 ] _",

    "the opposite signs of @xmath35 with respect to those of @xmath36 are explained by the attractive nature of gravity ; furthermore , the ratio of gravitomagnetic charge to the gravitoelectric charge is always 2 , since the linear approximation of general relativity is characterized by a spin-2 field .",
