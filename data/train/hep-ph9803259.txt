    "it is well known that any hope of stabilizing a hierarchy of scales requires supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the disparity between the weak scale and the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale or the planck scale ( hereafter lumped together as the `` high scale '' ) is bridged in a softly broken supersymmetric standard model by rendering scalar mass renormalization to be at most logarithmically divergent .",
    "the canonical approach to connecting these disparate scales is through the renormalization group ( rg ) , and there has been enormous effort in calculating and evaluating the rg equations analytically and numerically , e.g.  refs .",
    "most of this effort has been directed towards either the consequences of a given high scale theory ( be it a gut , string theory , or other high scale proposal ) on weak scale phenomenology , or the consequences of present ( or proposed ) weak scale measurements on high scale physics .",
    "a general , softly broken , weak scale supersymmetric model has a large number of additional parameters beyond those of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "most of the parameters are interconnected through the rg equations , and therefore successful extrapolation generally requires a simplifying framework ( or an organizing principle ) to be imposed either at the weak scale or the high scale . even with the varied simplified frameworks that have been traditionally used , such as supergravity - motivated models , gauge - mediated models , and so on , there are a sufficient number of parameters that one usually resorts to numerical sampling .",
    "while this approach usually gives the correct general trends , it could also easily give misleading results if the physics of the model depends very sensitively on a sampled parameter .",
    "disentangling the dependencies of any given supersymmetric parameter on other parameters has proved to be formidable task .",
    "the first step , extracting weak scale observables , is likely going to be challenging both experimentally ( discovery , and then mass and coupling measurements ) and theoretically ( mixings between gauginos , one - loop corrections , etc . ) .",
    "hence , the subsequent extrapolation of the full theory to higher scales will be unreliable unless quantities can be found that are not highly interdependent on other parameters of the theory .",
    "one such quantity is the ratio of the gaugino mass to the gauge coupling squared , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath4 . in principle",
    ", one can extract @xmath2 by `` merely '' measuring the gaugino mass , given that the standard model gauge couplings are by now well measured . remarkably , the one - loop rg equation for @xmath2 vanishes  @xcite , which suggests that a measurement at the weak scale would determine the value at the high scale , up to small two - loop corrections ( albeit scaled by @xmath5 ) .",
    "the usefulness of the ratio @xmath2 at higher scales is , ultimately , model - dependent .",
    "however , there are strong motivations to think that the pattern of the gauge couplings and the gaugino masses at the high scale will determine a great deal about the high scale theory . in guts",
    ", one ordinarily expects that the gauge couplings and the gaugino masses will `` unify '' , or take the same value , after being embedded in the gut group  @xcite . even in string theory",
    "there are reasons to suggest the gaugino masses could be unified in the simplest scenarios  @xcite .",
    "if we could reliably calculate @xmath2 at the high scale , no doubt one could match string phenomenology to such quantities , strengthening the predictions of successful models ( and eliminating classes of unsuccessful models ) .",
    "in addition , given a motivation for thinking @xmath6 or @xmath7 should take a certain value , it would also be trivial to extract the gaugino masses by themselves from the ratios @xmath2 .",
    "the difficulty of unambiguously extrapolating the individual quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , or even other weak scale parameters such as squark and slepton soft masses , is mainly due to the one - loop rg evolution and one - loop dependence on threshold corrections . in particular , extrapolating up @xmath10 orders of magnitude in scale to the apparent unification scale @xmath11  gev is notoriously complicated by weak scale supersymmetry threshold corrections , gut scale threshold corrections , extra matter at intermediate scales , planck scale corrections , etc . using the ratio",
    "@xmath2 mitigates many of these issues due to the one - loop rg invariance , as we will see .",
    "our goal is ultimately to determine how well @xmath2 can be known at higher scales , and thus we will be primarily concerned with running _ up _ to the high scale ( or messenger scale ) , rather than the more traditional approach of running _ down _ from a boundary condition imposed by some supersymmetry breaking ansatz .",
    "our results can , of course , be easily inverted should there be a motivation to do so .",
    "bottom - up approaches to supersymmetry have been considered before ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , generally with the philosophy that weak scale phenomenology ought to be extrapolated to the high scale , leaving the high scale matching to guts or string theory .",
    "our approach is similar , in that we start from the weak scale , but differs from some of the previous analyses by extrapolating only the ratios @xmath2 , and yet also considering various high scale effects . throughout most of this work",
    "we illustrate the results of extrapolation from near the weak scale @xmath12  tev up to the apparent unification scale @xmath13  gev ; should the soft mass generation scale be much lower as in gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models , the size of the corrections will be smaller , but can still be easily extracted from most of the graphs we present .",
    "similarly , effects in high scale theories ( with gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking ) can give corrections to the ordinary expectations for @xmath2 at the weak scale . by quantifying the various effects that could disrupt the one - loop expectations for @xmath2",
    ", we are simultaneously showing that a naive interpretation of the gaugino mass ratios at the weak scale could easily give misleading conclusions , but a systematic evaluation of the effects discussed here could lead to intriguing signals of physics at much higher scales .",
    "the most obvious class of corrections to the one - loop invariant @xmath2 are the two - loop corrections  @xcite ( in the supersymmetric @xmath14 renormalization scheme  @xcite ) .",
    "the two - loop corrections ought to be small , if perturbation theory is valid . however , there are reasons to suggest that the size of two - loop corrections could be larger than one might naively guess .",
    "the two - loop coefficients are not of @xmath15 , but in fact @xmath16 ( in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the two - loop coefficients lie in the range @xmath17 ) . also , two - loop terms proportional to the yukawa couplings are present , and of course the top yukawa is large at the weak scale .",
    "finally , extrapolation to the high scale involves running over @xmath10 orders of magnitude in scale , and therefore the ( resummed ) logarithm from rg evolution is comparatively large .",
    "( analogously , if the soft mass generation scale is much lower , then the effect of rg evolution is not nearly as large . )",
    "if two - loop corrections become important , then three - loop corrections may also be important , if for no other reason than to check that perturbation theory is indeed valid .",
    "however , a complete three - loop analysis would entail using three - loop gauge and gaugino mass @xmath18-functions , at least two - loop yukawa couplings and scalar trilinear couplings , and two - loop thresholds .",
    "the three - loop gauge coupling @xmath18-functions for a general mssm were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the three - loop gaugino @xmath18-functions were recently presented in ref .",
    "two - loop @xmath18-functions for the yukawa couplings and scalar trilinear couplings are by now well known  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge two - loop threshold corrections ( in a nondecoupling scheme )",
    "have not been calculated , although one could implement a decoupling scheme whereby the two - loop coefficients are changed as each threshold is crossed ; this procedure is an approximation that should be straightforward to calculate from generalized two - loop @xmath18-functions , although we decline to present it here .",
    "an additional well - known complexity in going to three - loops is that the @xmath18-functions are no longer scheme independent  @xcite . in any case , we will not attempt to calculate corrections beyond two - loop , instead relying on others calculations  @xcite of three - loop corrections to guide us in those cases where we suspect perturbation theory may be in trouble .",
    "the central reason why three - loop corrections should be unnecessary ( unless a coupling gets large ) is that there is no dependence on any additional parameters beyond those needed for the two - loop corrections .",
    "the intriguing pattern of the supersymmetric parameter interdependence is given in table  [ depend - table ] , where we show the dependencies arising at one- , two- , and three - loop order in the rg equations .",

    "the first , what we call `` fully supersymmetric thresholds '' , occur when extra matter is decoupled from the spectrum in a fully supersymmetry way .",
    "the rg equations as given above are sufficient to remove matter ( both the scalar and fermionic components of a chiral superfield ) at any scale , provided the masses of the scalar and fermionic components are the same . both one - loop and two - loop decoupling can be achieved ; the importance of the latter for the @xmath53 ratio is discussed in sec .",
    "[ extra - matter - sec ] .",
    "the second kind of thresholds are those near the weak scale , when the supersymmetric components of the sm spectrum are decoupled .",

    "finally , note that the two - loop corrections due to weak scale thresholds could in principle be calculated , but we ignore these corrections since they are not enhanced by a large logarithm ( unlike fully supersymmetric thresholds ) , see ref .",
