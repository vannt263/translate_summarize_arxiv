    "one of the central problems in condensed phase dynamics concerns the development of accurate and efficient methods for the treatment of charge and energy transport .",
    "these processes are inherently quantum mechanical and underpin many of the forefront problems in chemistry , biology and materials science , such as catalysis involving electron transfer @xcite , proton transfer @xcite , or proton - coupled electron transfer ( pcet ) @xcite and electronic excitation energy transfer @xcite . due to the poor scaling of exact quantum dynamics with both time and system dimensionality these approaches are only feasible for a small class of models or for specific forms of the potential @xcite .",
    "hence , in complex systems , a multi - tiered approach is typically employed in which the most important or most quantum mechanical degrees of freedom are treated as a quantum subsystem while the remaining degrees of freedom are designated as the bath which can be treated at a lower level of theory , such as by classical mechanics @xcite . adopting such a scheme has led to the development of a series of trajectory - based methods that allow the treatment of quantum dynamics in large condensed phase systems for general potentials .",
    "the most computationally efficient of these are mean - field type theories , such as ehrenfest theory or those arising from linearization of the quantum propagator @xcite .",
    "although these methods are computationally efficient they fail to provide an accurate description of the approach to equilibrium in relaxation processes when the subsystem levels are non - degenerate , and they can not account for quantum coherence in the bath degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "these inaccuracies are emphasized when the subsystem and the bath are strongly coupled .",
    "higher accuracy can be achieved by foregoing linearization of the quantum subsystem degrees of freedom , thus obtaining a partially linearized approach @xcite .",
    "however , simulations based on these techniques are limited to short time - scales due to undesirable scaling of their computation cost with evolution time .    another important consideration in trajectory - based approaches is the basis in which the quantum subsystem is represented . typically in model problems",
    "the hamiltonian is defined in the diabatic basis .",
    "however , electronic structure calculations produce adiabatic surfaces and hence combination with on - the - fly electronic structure is dramatically aided by working in the adiabatic representation .",
    "the trajectory - based fewest switches surface hopping ( fssh ) @xcite , and its variants @xcite , have thus become widely used .",
    "however , fssh lacks a rigorous derivation , suffers from decoherence problems , and has also recently been shown to be deficient in treating isolated electron transfer due to its inability to obtain the correct scaling of marcus golden rule rate @xcite .",
    "several schemes have been formulated in order to attempt to solve these issues however , due to the lack of a formal derivation they simply provide _ ad hoc _ corrections @xcite .    a rigorous method to generate dynamics in the adiabatic representation",
    "is provided by the momentum - jump ( mj ) solution to the quantum - classical liouville equation ( qcle ) @xcite .",
    "the mj solution yields a surface - hopping type algorithm in which evolution on adiabatic surfaces is interspersed with instantaneous jumps between surfaces . for weakly nonadiabatic systems ,",
    "where the average number of jumps between surfaces is small , the mj solution provides a highly accurate and computationally tractable approach @xcite .",
    "however , in strongly nonadiabatic regimes , where multiple jumps between surfaces are likely to occur , the weights accumulated upon making jumps give rise to a very rapidly growing statistical error at long times .",
    "hence , convergence of the population dynamics by the direct application of these methods is intractable at the times required for the population dynamics to fully decay",
    ".    it would therefore be highly advantageous if the rich information embodied in the short time trajectories generated from highly accurate partially linearized methods could be used to generate long time population dynamics .",
    "the generalized quantum master equation ( gqme ) formalism offers a method to achieve this by allowing the problem of obtaining dynamics at arbitrarily long times to be exactly mapped onto the calculation of the memory kernel @xcite . in cases where the range of frequencies present in the bath is larger than that of the subsystem , as is typically the case in condensed phase systems",
    ", the memory kernel can decay many orders of magnitude more quickly than the population dynamics .",
    "this observation has previously been used to improve the efficiency of real - time path integral approaches @xcite and second order cumulant expansion techniques @xcite .",
    "it has also been leveraged in order to improve the accuracy of fully linearized techniques that can be applied to a much wider set of hamiltonians @xcite . here , we show how the gqme formalism can be exploited to generate long - time dynamics from a partially linearized approach that , due to poor scaling with time , can not be converged at long times when used directly .",
    "in particular , we combine the mj solution to the qcle in the adiabatic basis with the generalized quantum master equation formalism to yield a surface hopping approach that is both efficient and accurate . by making such a combination",
    "we invoke no additional approximations to the mj solution , while significantly reducing the computational cost compared with direct mj dynamics .",
    "the resulting mj - gqme method can therefore be applied to provide accurate long time dynamics in nonadiabatic regimes where fssh and linearized approaches are inaccurate and direct mj dynamics can not be converged . since it is based on semi - classical trajectories",
    "the mj - gqme approach is flexible enough to be applied to general hamiltonians which are not amenable to other accurate methods which typically require specific forms of the hamiltonian such as harmonic environments or bi - linear system - bath coupling .",
    "we demonstrate our approach by applying it to the spin boson problem in regimes where typical trajectory - based approaches to quantum dynamics fail .",
    "we first describe an adiabatic basis mj solution to the qcle , which yields an ensemble of surface - hopping type trajectories .",
    "we then show how this solution can be combined with the gqme formalism in order to yield a method which allows one to perform long - time nonadiabatic dynamics simulations .      consider a system in which only a small subset of the degrees of freedom behave quantum mechanically to a significant degree , for example electronic degrees of freedom , or light atoms such as protons .",
    "we denote this set of degrees of freedom as the quantum subsystem ( or simply as the subsystem ) .",
    "the remainder of the system , typically the heavy atoms , is referred to as the bath and is assumed to behave essentially classically .",
    "this allows one to write the total hamiltonian in the following form , @xmath0 where the subscripts @xmath1 and @xmath2 refer to the subsystem , the bath , and the system - bath coupling , respectively .",
    "the quantum - classical liouville equation @xcite , @xmath3 describes the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath4 , which is a quantum mechanical operator that depends on the classical phase space variables @xmath5 of the bath .",
    "the quantum - classical liouville ( qcl ) operator is @xmath6 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\{\\hat{h}_w,\\cdot\\ } -\\{\\cdot,\\hat{h}_w\\}),\\ ] ] where @xmath7 $ ] is the commutator , and @xmath8 is the poisson bracket in the phase space of the environmental variables .",
    "the subscript @xmath9 refers to the partial wigner transform over the environmental degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "the partial wigner transform for an arbitrary operator , @xmath10 , is @xmath11    in the adiabatic basis the qcle leads to a surface - hopping - type solution where segments of classical evolution are interspersed with energy - conserving quantum transitions@xcite .",
    "the qcl operator may be written in this basis as a sum of diagonal ( adiabatic ) and off - diagonal ( nonadiabatic ) parts , @xmath12 the adiabatic part of the operator is explicitly given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the classical propagator on the @xmath15 adiabatic surface , @xmath16 is the hellmann - feynman force on adiabatic state @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the dynamical phase .    the nonadiabatic part of the qcl operator , @xmath19 , produces quantum transitions between adiabatic surfaces and associated momentum transfer with the environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath20 here @xmath21 are the matrix elements of the nonadiabatic coupling vector , and @xmath22 .    in order to arrive at a surface hopping - type representation",
    "the overall propagator is divided into a string of @xmath23 short time propagators of length @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 . denoting pairs of quantum states @xmath15 by a single index , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dimensionality of the subsystem hilbert space",
    ", the matrix elements of the total propagator may be written as @xmath28 a trotter factorization is then applied to each short time propagator in the above product , in order to separate the adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts , @xmath29 a further trotter factorization is then applied to each of the short - time nonadiabatic propagators , which yields @xcite @xmath30 the explicit forms of the matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 for a two level system are @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35    other than the trotter factorization of the short - time propagators , no further approximations have been made to the qcle thus far .",
    "however due to the linear term @xmath36 in eq.([eq : trotter_2 ] ) , the action of the short - time nonadiabatic propagators is not straightforward to evaluate .",
    "hence , at this point one may invoke the momentum - jump ( mj ) approximation @xcite , where the linear term in eq.([eq : trotter_2 ] ) is replaced with an exponential , @xmath37 .",
    "such an approximation is valid when the changes in environmental momenta are small @xcite .    upon applying the mj approximation ,",
    "the nonadiabatic propagator can be written as @xmath38 where the explicit form of the mj matrix @xmath39 for a two level system is @xcite    @xmath40    the mj matrix @xmath41 contains the operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 which give rise to the momentum changes in the bath that accompany the nonadiabatic transitions occurring in the quantum subsystem .",
    "the @xmath42 operators are applied when the quantum subsystem makes a transition between diagonal and off - diagonal adiabatic surfaces , whereas @xmath43 are applied when the subsystem makes a transition between two diagonal adiabatic surfaces .",
    "the action of these operators results in a change in the momentum of the bath , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 the resulting dynamics is a surface hopping scheme in which classical evolution on a single adiabatic surface is interspersed with quantum transitions accompanied by classical momentum shifts .",
    "there are two major differences between this mj surface hopping scheme and the more commonly adopted fssh approach .",
    "firstly , in fssh the bath dynamics is prescribed to only be performed on diagonal adiabatic surfaces . however , in the mj approach the dynamics of the bath degrees of freedom can occur on either single adiabatic surfaces or the mean of two adiabatic surfaces , during which the system accumulates a dynamical phase ( eq.([eq : qcl_diag ] ) ) . secondly , the jump selection criteria in each approach are different as described in more detail below",
    ".    trajectories are generated by the action of the short time propagators in eq.([eq : total_prop ] ) which involves alternate applications of the adiabatic and nonadiabatic propagators .",
    "the adiabatic part of the qcl operator in eq.([eq : qcl_diag ] ) can be written as the product of a phase factor , and a classical evolution propagator .",
    "the phase factor , @xmath46 , associated with evolution on a surface @xmath47 from time @xmath48 to time @xmath49 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the coordinates of the bath at time @xmath52 arising from classical evolution on state @xmath47 . hence , the total short time propagator can be written as @xmath53 the nonadiabatic propagator is applied by monte carlo sampling from @xmath39 @xcite . if the system is initially in state @xmath54 , a new state index @xmath47 is chosen by sampling from the set of possible system states with the following probability @xmath55 if the system has sufficient momentum along the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector to access the new state , then the jump is accepted and the momentum shift is performed .",
    "the trajectory is then weighted by the inverse of the jumping probability given in eq.([eq : p_jump ] ) . by virtue of this sampling procedure ,",
    "each time a jump is sampled the trajectory is re - weighted by the factor @xmath56 .",
    "it is the multiplicative accumulation of these weights , and the associated phase factors , which leads to numerical difficulties with the convergence of this method at long times @xcite .",
    "hence to generate the time - evolution of an observable , after sampling from the initial density , trajectories are propagated in the following manner :    1 .",
    "the bath degrees of freedom are evolved classically from an initial phase point @xmath57 to @xmath58 , on the @xmath54 adiabatic surface through a time - segment of length @xmath59 .",
    "a new subsystem state index @xmath47 is determined by monte carlo sampling using the probability measure given in eq.([eq : p_jump ] ) .",
    "the transition to the state @xmath47 is assessed ; if the momentum shift to be applied is imaginary then the transition is forbidden and the jump is rejected . if the transition is allowed , the momentum shift ( if any ) is applied , such that @xmath60 , where @xmath44 is given by eq.([eq : p_trans ] ) , and the subsystem state label is changed from @xmath54 to @xmath47 . if the jump is rejected , then @xmath61 .",
    "the statistical weight of the trajectory is multiplied by the denominator of eq.([eq : p_jump ] ) .",
    "the bath degrees of freedom are evolved classically on the @xmath62 adiabatic surface through a time - segment of length @xmath59 .",
    "this process is then repeated until the required number of time - steps have been performed .",
    "although the mj surface hopping approach provides an accurate method to propagate nonadiabatic quantum dynamics , as we will see in sec.([sec : results ] ) , the rapid accumulation of statistical weights makes the direct application of this scheme intractable in many cases . in this section",
    "we show how the mj scheme can be combined with the gqme formalism to yield an approach which allows for the generation of long time nonadiabatic dynamics .    as discussed in sec.([sec : intro ] ) , in many condensed phase systems one is primarily interested in the time - evolution of the reduced density of the subsystem , which is defined as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the density operator for the entire system , and @xmath65 indicates the partial trace taken over the bath degrees of freedom . in the problem that we consider in sec.([sec : results ] ) the initial state of the system can be factorized in the following manner , @xmath66 where @xmath67 } \\ ] ] is the density operator for the isolated bath in thermal equilibrium .",
    "in what follows we will assume such a factorization however this condition need not be applied in general @xcite .",
    "we assume that the coupling part of the hamiltonian , @xmath68 is of the form , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a pure subsystem operator , and @xmath71 is a pure bath operator .",

    "[ sec : results ] such a condition is naturally satisfied however in general cases it can be simply incorporated by redefining @xmath71 relative to its thermal average @xcite .    under these conditions ,",

    "the free subsystem evolution prescribed by @xmath81 is generally very simple to simulate , and hence in the gqme picture , calculating the evolution of the subsystem rdm reduces to the calculation of the memory kernel , @xmath82 .",
    "the general form for the memory kernel , given above , is not straightforward to evaluate since it explicitly depends on the projection operator , @xmath77 .",

    "ehrenfest captures the correct trend in the long time populations but underestimates the effect of changing the driving force on the long time population difference .",
    "in contrast , despite its earlier failure to describe the long time populations in other nonadiabatic biased regimes with strong system - bath coupling ( figs . [ fig:3 ] , [ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] )",
    "pbme gives excellent agreement with the exact long time populations .",
    "the success of pbme in this marcus regime is likely due to the high temperature bath that is known to improve the accuracy of the pbme since the approximated back reaction term becomes less important @xcite .",
    "mj - gqme gives exact agreement with the long time populations .    ,",
    "and @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 is the reorganization energy .",
    "exact distribution , @xmath141 , ( black line ) , mj - gqme ( green open squares ) , pbme ( red filled circles , dotted line ) , ehrenfest ( crosses , navy dashed line ) , and fssh ( turquoise diamonds , dot - dashed line ) . ]    the failure of ehrenfest and fssh to obtain accurate long time populations is of considerable concern given that most systems in which one would like to investigate the the mechanism of charge or energy transfer involve multiple states . since all of the methods employed here preserve the trace of the subsystem rdm , the two level system provides a best case scenario since the population must be in one of the two states so only one detailed balance relation exists .",
    "however , in many problems the subsystem contains a large number of states and hence the effect of violating detailed balance would be amplified . in these cases",
    "one should therefore be very careful in assessing the importance of the pathways by which the relaxation occurs based on the predictions of methods such as ehrenfest and fssh .",
    "although pbme performs slightly better than ehrenfest in the marcus regime , in the regimes investigated earlier it performed equally poorly in describing relaxation to the correct distribution . as such its application",
    "should be approached with care , particularly in biased systems coupled to low temperature baths . throughout our testing our mj - gqme approach",
    "has proved to be a highly robust approach that is able to accurately interpolate all the way between disparate regimes ranging from those relevant in energy transfer all the way to strongly coupled electron transfer regimes . the fact that it can achieve this while retaining the flexibility to treat the more general forms of the hamiltonian to which ehrenfest , fssh or pbme can be applied suggests it will prove useful in such problems particularly in cases where it is important to go beyond harmonic baths or linear coupling to the environment .",
    "we have shown that using the mj solution to the quantum classical liouville equation combined with the generalized master equation framework circumvents the problems associated with direct application of the mj approach alone , which leads to rapidly growing statistical errors with time .",
    "the resulting mj - gqme surface hopping approach has been shown to be highly accurate , and yet can be applied to generate long time dynamics in regimes which are strongly nonadiabatic , biased and exhibit strong system - bath coupling . in these regimes",
    "we showed that the competing approaches give poor agreement with exact results .",
    "the resulting algorithm was shown to be able to reproduce the marcus turnover curve and yield accurate long time populations despite lying in a formidable parameter regime for trajectory - based approaches .",
    "the mj - gqme approach can therefore be used to accurately tune between perturbative and non perturbative parameter regimes ranging from electron transfer to electronic energy transfer .",
    "in addition , because the evaluation of the kernels is based on semiclassical trajectories , it is also easily adaptable to any form of the system , bath or coupling between them i.e. it is in no way limited to the linear coupling or harmonic bath invoked in the spin boson model studied here .",
    "in addition to accuracy , a major consideration is the relative computational cost . for the highly non adiabatic regimes with strong system - bath coupling",
    "shown @xmath142 trajectories were typically required for convergence of the mj - gqme population dynamics .",
    "this is considerably higher than the @xmath143 needed in the fssh , ehrenfest and pbme schemes .",
    "however , the trajectories that are needed to generate the long time dynamics from the master equation are at least an order magnitude shorter than than those required to directly generate the population dynamics using the mj - gqme method , due to the fast decay of the memory kernels .",
    "hence , in these regimes where most trajectory based approaches fail to obtain the correct population decay behavior and final populations our mj - gqme approach is of comparable cost and typically no more than one order of magnitude more expensive .",
    "however , in adiabatic regimes with weak system - bath coupling the mj - gqme kernels can be converged with @xmath143 trajectories and hence , combined with the shorter trajectories needed to converge the kernels , is cheaper than the existing methods .",
    "hence , one only pays an additional computational cost in using mj - gqme over the other approaches when those approaches give quantitatively and often qualitatively incorrect results , and hence their employment would be questionable .    in summary , combining the rigorous mj - surface hopping algorithm with the gqme in order to evolve the subsystem rdm offers an accurate alternative to fssh and mean field theories ( such as ehrenfest , pbme , and lsc - ivr ) at a modest extra computational cost .",
    "the mj - gqme approach should therefore provide a powerful tool in the investigation of charge and energy transfer in complex systems .",
