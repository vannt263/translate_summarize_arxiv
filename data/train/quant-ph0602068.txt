    "entanglement is an important non - classical phenomenon in quantum mechanics which plays also a crucial role in the novel field of quantum information theory . while for pure quantum states it is equivalent to correlations , for mixed states the two notions differ . in this general case",
    ", an @xmath0-qubit quantum state is entangled if its density matrix can not be written as a convex sum of product states @xmath1 states of the form eq .",
    "( [ sep ] ) are called separable .",
    "based on this definition , several sufficient conditions for entanglement have been developed . in special cases ,",
    "e.g. for @xmath2 ( two - qubit ) and @xmath3 ( qubit - qutrit ) bipartite systems @xcite and for bipartite multi - mode gaussian states @xcite even necessary and sufficient conditions are known .",
    "however , in an experimental situation usually only limited information about the quantum state is available . in this case , only those approaches for entanglement detection can be applied which require the measurement of not too many observables .",
    "one of such approaches is using entanglement witnesses .",
    "they are entanglement conditions which are linear in expectation values of observables .",
    "the theory of entanglement witnesses has recently been rapidly developing @xcite .",
    "it has been shown how to generate entanglement witnesses that detect states close to a given one , even if it is mixed or a bound entangled state @xcite .",
    "it is also known how to optimize a witness operator in order to detect the most entangled states @xcite .",
    "apart from constructing witnesses , it is also important to find a way to measure them .",
    "optimal measurement of witnesses have been studied in refs .",
    "recently , witnesses have been developed to detect entanglement in physical systems in the thermodynamical limit @xcite .",
    "entanglement witnesses can not only be used to detect entanglement experimentally , but can also be used to characterize the entanglement of a multipartite quantum state . as we will see later , in the multipartite setting several different classes of entanglement occur , and entanglement witnesses can be used to decide in which class a given state is @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we ask what we can do for systems of very many particles , e.g. , for spin chains in thermal equilibrium .",
    "entanglement in spin chains has already been extensively studied @xcite . in section 2",
    "we discuss how to detect entanglement in general in spin models based on the ideas presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section 3",
    "we study the detection of different types of multipartite entanglement in these systems as discussed in ref .",
    "for this aim , we determine what the important questions are from this point of view in spin systems in the thermodynamical limit",
    ". then we look for appropriate entanglement witnesses , which are easy to construct and study multipartite entanglement with them @xcite .",
    "let us consider first the two - qubit case .",
    "the simplest expression which can be used for entanglement detection must contain at least two correlation terms @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are operators acting on qubits @xmath7 for simplicity , let us consider @xmath5 and @xmath6 with eigenvalues @xmath8 now , if we want to use @xmath9 for entanglement detection , we have to make sure that @xmath10 where the right hand side of the equation is minimized over the set of product states @xmath11 .",
    "( minimization over all mixed separable states would lead to the same value due to the convexity of the set of separable states . )",
    "( [ larger ] ) expresses the fact that the minimum of @xmath12 must be larger for separable states than for quantum states in general . for",
    "that it is necessary to have @xcite @xmath13&\\ne & 0 , \\label{comm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath7 here @xmath14 $ ] denotes the commutator .",
    "( [ comm ] ) expresses the fact that we have to measure two different observables at each party . for entanglement detection in an experiment , the ratio of the two minima in eq .",
    "( [ larger ] ) must be the largest possible .",
    "it is straightforward to see that this is the case if we choose operators such that @xmath15 for @xmath7 here @xmath16 denotes the anticommutator .",
    "an example for such an operator is then @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote pauli spin matrices . for this operator",
    "the minimum of the expectation value is @xmath20 the state giving the minimum is the two - qubit singlet @xmath21 for this state @xmath22 the minimum for product states can be obtained as follows . for product states we have @xmath23 where the last inequality follows from the cauchy - schwarz inequality and knowing that @xmath24 among operators with three correlation terms used for entanglement detection the following form is optimal @xmath25 the minimum of the expectation value of @xmath26 is @xmath27 . for separable states",
    "the minimum is @xmath28 which can be proved similarly as it has been done for @xmath29    now let us move to the @xmath0-qubit case . consider the expression @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the coupling constant and according to the usual assumption for a periodic boundary condition qubit @xmath32 is identical to qubit @xmath33 this is the hamiltonian for the xy chain .",
    "the minimum for separable states is now @xmath34 this comes from knowing that for product states each term in the summation in eq .",
    "( [ hxy ] ) is bounded by @xmath28 as we have seen it before .",
    "the minimum for quantum states can be obtained from numerical calculations since the @xmath35 model is solvable @xcite .",
    "similarly , we can define @xmath36 this is the hamiltonian for the heisenberg chain .",
    "the minimum for separable states is @xmath37 the minimum for quantum states can be obtained for large @xmath0 as @xcite @xmath38    for our spin chain hamiltonians the ratio between the minimum for general quantum states and the minimum for separable states is smaller than for eqs .",
    "( [ hxy],[hh ] ) since there is not a quantum state saturating all two - body correlation terms .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that there is not a hamiltonian built from two - body correlations such that its unique ground state saturates all correlation terms and this ground state is true multipartite entangled @xcite .",
    "what are the advantages of the expressions eq .",
    "( [ hxy ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ hh ] ) in detecting entanglement ?",
    "they are easily measurable locally , since they are the sum of only a few two - body correlation terms . moreover , in some physical systems eq .",
    "( [ hh ] ) can directly be measured as the average nearest - neighbor correlation , or as the energy of the system if this system can be described by a heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "= 3.0 in    the previous ideas can straightforwardly be applied to spin chains in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "let us consider the heisenberg hamiltonian in an external magnetic field @xmath39 for this hamiltonian , it is easy to bound the minimum for separable states @xcite .",
    "any time @xmath40 is below this value , we know that the thermal state is entangled .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_heisenberg ] .",
    "it shows the nearest - neighbor entanglement vs. @xmath41 and the temperature @xmath42 .",
    "the entanglement of formation was computed from the concurrence @xcite .",
    "light color indicates the region where the thermal ground state is detected as entangled based on the ideas discussed before .",
    "as one can see , there are regions with @xmath43 which are not detected .",
    "however , it can be seen in the figure that when the system contains at least a small amount of entanglement ( @xmath44 ) the state is detected as entangled .",
    "note that the sharp decrease of the nearest - neighbor entanglement around @xmath45 for @xmath46 is due to a quantum phase transition .",
    "in this section we will discuss how to detect multi - party entanglement by measuring the operators described before .",
    "our motivation is that entanglement for many particles is qualitatively different from the two - party case , and many new phenomena arise @xcite .",
    "there are several possibilities to classify entanglement of many parties .",
    "we are now looking for the terminology which is appropriate for spin chains of many particles .",
    "let us first recall the notion of genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "a pure state @xmath47 of a quantum system of @xmath0 parties is called _ fully separable _ if it is a product state for all parties , @xmath48 it is called _ biseparable _ , when a partition of the @xmath0 parties into two groups @xmath49 and @xmath41 can be found , such that the state is a product state with respect to this partition , namely @xmath50=@xmath51 @xmath52 . if this is not the case , the state is called _ genuine multipartite entangled . _",
    "note that the vectors @xmath53 and @xmath54 are allowed to contain entanglement within their partition .",
    "thus , to prove genuine multipartite entanglement , it does not suffice to exclude full separability .    for mixed states",
    ", these definitions can , as usual , be extended via convex combinations . indeed , the definition of full separability was already given in eq .",
    "( [ sep ] ) .",
    "a mixed state is biseparable , whenever we can write @xmath55 with biseparable @xmath56 and some probabilities @xmath57 here , the states @xmath56 are allowed to be biseparable with respect to different partitions .",
    "another approach to classify multipartite entanglement asks whether multipartite entanglement is necessary to form a given state @xcite . in this approach , a state @xmath47 _",
    "producible by @xmath58-party entanglement _ ( or @xmath58-producible , in short ) if we can write the state @xmath47 as a tensor product @xmath50=@xmath59@xmath60 ...",
    "@xmath61 , where the states @xmath62 are states on maximally @xmath58-qubits . in this definition",
    ", a two - producible state does not contain any multipartite entanglement , since it suffices to generate the two - qubit states @xmath62 to arrive at the state @xmath63 in addition , we say that a state _ contains genuine @xmath58-party entanglement _ if it is not producible by @xmath64-party entanglement .",
    "this definition can be extended to mixed states as before via convex combinations .",
    "again , a mixed state which is @xmath58-producible requires only the generation of @xmath58-party pure entangled states and mixing for its production ( see also fig .  2 )",
    ". consequently , a mixed state @xmath65 contains @xmath58-party entanglement , iff the correlations can not be explained by assuming the presence of @xmath64-party entanglement only in the pure subsensembles .",
    "the notions of genuine multipartite entanglement and producibility are not completely independent .",
    "for example , the states containing @xmath0-party entanglement are just the genuine multipartite entangled states and the one - producible states are fully separable .",
    "if one can show that a reduced state of @xmath66 qubits is genuine multipartite entangled , then this implies that the total state is not @xmath58-producible , while the converse is in general not true .    for spin chains of _ macroscopic _ size",
    ", it is in general very difficult to prove that the total state is genuine @xmath0-partite entangled via energy measurements .",
    "this is due to the fact that the notion of genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement is extremely sensitive to the properties of a single qubit . indeed , in order to prove genuine multipartite entanglement",
    ", one has to exclude the possibility , that one single qubit can be separated from the remaining @xmath67 qubits .",
    "however , multipartite entanglement in the _ reduced _ states of small numbers of qubits can easily be detected , as we will see . moreover ,",
    "if the reduced state is multipartite entangled then the state is not two - producible .",
    "= 3.2 in    = 3.2 in    now let us see our results for the xy model and the heisenberg chain .",
    "the proofs for the following theorems are given in ref .",
    "we always assume periodic boundary conditions and that the number of spins @xmath0 is even .",
    "* theorem 1 .",
    "* let @xmath65 be an @xmath0 qubit state whose dynamics is governed by the xy - hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hxy ] ) .",
    "if @xmath65 is one - producible ( fully separable ) , then -j n [ xxmodel1 ] holds .",
    "if @xmath68 this implies that there are two neighboring qubits such that their reduced state is entangled . for two",
    "- producible states - j n [ xxmodel2 ] holds .",
    "if @xmath69 the state contains thus tripartite entanglement and if < - j n - 1.207 j n [ xxmodel3 ] then there exist three neighboring qubits @xmath70 such that the reduced state @xmath71 of these qubits is genuine tripartite entangled .    for the heisenberg model , we can state the following :    * theorem 2 .",
    "* let @xmath65 be an @xmath0 qubit state with the heisenberg hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hxy ] ) .",
    "if @xmath65 is one - producible ( fully separable ) , then -j n [ xxxmodel2 ] holds , while for two - producible states - j n [ xxxmodel3 ] holds .",
    "thus , if @xmath72 the state contains genuine tripartite entanglement . furthermore , if < - jn - 1.618 j n [ xxxmodel1b ] then there are three neighboring qubits such that their reduced state is genuine tripartite entangled .",
    "let us see an example .",
    "consider the state shown in figure  [ fig_singlet](a ) @xmath73 where the two - qubit singlet is defined in eq .",
    "( [ singlet ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that state @xmath74 saturates the inequality eq .",
    "( [ xxxmodel3 ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising , since it is a two - producible state .",
    "let us now define operator @xmath75 which shifts the qubits by one , i.e. , @xmath76 consider the state @xmath77 this state is the mixture of the singlet chains depicted in figure  [ fig_singlet](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "@xmath78 is not fully separable and is not a product of single - qubit and two - qubit density matrices .",
    "moreover , the state @xmath78 has a negative partial transpose with respect to each partition .",
    "however , @xmath78 also saturates the inequality eq .",
    "( [ xxxmodel3 ] ) and it is also two - producible .",
    "that is , three - qubit entanglement is not needed to create it , and it contains no multipartite entanglement .",
    "the previous results can straightforwardly be used for obtaining a limit temperature for the different forms of entanglement .",
    "we define thus the temperatures @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 below which either reduced states of two or three parties are entangled or the total state contains two or three - party entanglement . obviously , @xmath83 has to hold here .",
    "these temperature bounds are shown for a heisenberg chains of a couple of spins in table 1 .",
    "as expected , the values for @xmath84 coincide with the ones of ref .",
    "the given values for @xmath82 and @xmath85 show that in the heisenberg chain of ten spins at @xmath86 multipartite entanglement plays a role , namely at least one reduced state is genuine tripartite entangled and the total state contains tripartite entanglement .    .",
    "threshold temperatures @xmath87 and @xmath82 for a heisenberg chain .",
    "the parameters as set to @xmath88 see text for details . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we discussed how to construct entanglement conditions using two - body correlations .",
    "this implies , that typical hamiltonians as appearing in the xy model or the heisenberg model can serve for entanglement detection in spin models . also different forms of multipartite entanglement can be detected in this way .",
    "a natural continuation of our work lies in the extension of our bounds to other systems . here ,",
    "spin systems in two or three dimensions as well as frustrated systems are of interest .",
    "furthermore , it would be also desirable to derive energy bounds also for higher classes of multipartite entanglement , e.g. three - producible states",
