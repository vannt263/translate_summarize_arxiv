    "to generalize kl theory to magnetism , we need to first identify the theoretical constructs that underpin the theory of phonons and then seek analogs of these constructs in the magnon problem .    the simplest description of phonons , that of the vibrations of balls connected to springs ( in the classical limit ) , is endowed with a number of theoretical constructs that shed much light on their behavior .",
    "to begin with , this simplicity demands a specific form of their hamiltonian .",
    "if we define the extension of spring @xmath3 to be @xmath4 , then the most general form for an ideal balls and springs classical hamiltonian is @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the @xmath7 component of the momentum of the ball labeled by @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the matrix inverse of the `` mass tensor '' @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the spring constant matrix and repeated indices are summed over . in the simplest setting , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are proportional to identity matrices . here",
    "we leave them in the general form to aid our study of the structure of the theory and not its application .",
    "the restriction of the hamiltonian to that of balls and springs therefore introduces two ( inverse ) metrics @xmath11 and @xmath9 in configuration space and momentum space respectively and identifies the ground state as satisfying constraints @xmath14 , @xmath15 .    balls and springs are a toy - like simplification of a full phonon problem .",
    "we will return to the justification of their use and the validity of the following results in the next section ( section [ sec : topologicalprotections ] ) .    in the linearized phonon limit",
    ", there is also a matrix @xmath16 and an associated topological invariant .",
    "this matrix relates @xmath4 to the displacements of each atom @xmath17 from their equilibrium positions via @xmath18 .",
    "this matrix also relates the forces @xmath19 to the tensions @xmath20 in each spring via @xmath21 .",
    "the topological invariant associated with this matrix ( which we will call the maxwell - calladine index@xcite though it was discovered by kane and lubensky ) is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of components @xmath24 , @xmath25 the number of sites , @xmath26 the number of springs ( bonds ) , @xmath27 denotes the dimension of the null space of @xmath28 and we have used @xmath29 by the fundamental theorem of linear algebra .",
    "this quantity relates the topology data of the system , @xmath23 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 to the number of zero modes @xmath30 and number of states of self stress @xmath31 . here",
    "a zero mode is a vector @xmath32 that satisfies @xmath33 and a state of self stress is a vector of tensions @xmath34 that satisfies @xmath35 .",
    "this quantity is topological in the sense that it does nt depend on the metrics @xmath36 and @xmath9 and remains unchanged under any changes of the matrix @xmath16 .",
    "so linearized balls and springs also have a natural topological invariant .",
    "kane and lubensky argued that a dirac - like square - rooted equations of motion enables the study of phonons following the theory of topological insulators .",
    "these equations of motion are defined by the matrix @xmath37 here i have taken the liberty to add a minus sign to kane and lubensky s matrix and re - inserted @xmath36 and @xmath9 which they set to identity matrices .",
    "this is so that squaring this matrix produces @xmath38 where the upper left block defines the second order differential equation for the displacements @xmath39 the minus sign can be removed by multiplying @xmath40 by @xmath41 from the right , something we are free to do since @xmath42 commutes with the @xmath43 ( a feature noted by kane and lubensky ) .",
    "this model helps us understand the importance of the topological index .",
    "if , for periodic boundary conditions , @xmath44 then there must always be either a zero mode ( if @xmath45 ) or a self stress mode ( if @xmath46 ) . in the spectrum of @xmath40 there is no gap to the excitations .",
    "however , if @xmath47 then we can always find an @xmath16 such that the gap disappears .",
    "in such a case , if we open the boundary conditions we will invariably find that @xmath44 since we change the counting of the number of sites and bonds and so either special self stresses exist due to boundary conditions or special zero modes exist . in either case , there is an interplay between a gap , topology and boundary conditions as found in other topological systems such as the quantum hall effect or topological insulators .",
    "finally , there is one more mathematical object we will find useful for the study of phonons . to study the zero modes of this problem directly",
    ", we can follow ref . and",
    "view the hamiltonian as energetically imposing constraints on the degrees of freedom . here",
    "these constraints are simply @xmath48 and @xmath15 as noted above for if these conditions are met the hamiltonian vanishes . in his development of constrained hamiltonian mechanics ,",
    "dirac pointed out that an important object in the study of constraints in phase space is the constraint matrix which here takes the form : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the usual poisson bracket of classical mechanics .",
    "a vector in the null space of this matrix is then either associated with a redundant constraint ( when there are more constraint functions than necessary to constrain the variables ) or with a zero mode coordinate that has no conjugate variable in the space of zero modes ( gauge coordinate ) .",
    "if we expand the spring extensions @xmath4 in terms of the displacements of the atoms from their equilibrium positions @xmath17 as @xmath51 then the constraint matrix takes the form @xmath52 remarkably , in this form , @xmath53 is similar to the `` square - rooted '' hamiltonian @xmath40 discussed above .",
    "if we work in kane and lubensky s units where @xmath54 and @xmath55 they are actually the same .",
    "we also see that the redundant constraints are associated with self stress modes living in the null space of @xmath56 and the gauge coordinates with the zero modes living in the null space of @xmath16 .",
    "so the eigenvalue problem associated with dirac s constraint matrix here is closely related to the dirac - like square - rooted phonon hamiltonian !",
    "now the relationship between all of these mathematical objects , the metrics , the hamiltonians , the @xmath16 matrix , and the constraint matrix are not so easily understood .",
    "they all clearly derive from the balls and springs construction . but",
    "how is the topological index dependent on the metrics ?",
    "how is the constraint matrix @xmath57 related to the square - rooted hamiltonian @xmath40 ? in what way is the topology protected ? can these constructions be applied to other systems that are not balls and springs ?    to address these questions , we need an abstract theoretical framework that identifies all of these mathematical object from a simpler set of constructs . remarkably , such a framework is provided by extending the model s phase space to include a set of fermion degrees of freedom @xmath58 and @xmath59 that we will call phonino modes and imposing supersymmetry . from this vantage point",
    "we will then look down on all the mathematical objects discussed previously and see their relationships to each other .",
    "the formal nature of the supersymmetry will then also allow us to connect two seemingly different problems : balls and springs and quadratic spin models .",
    "we then just need to determine if the connection is merely formal or whether it predicts new physical phenomena for either balls and springs or magnetic systems .",
    "a hamiltonian that is a quadratic form in constraint functions that define its ground state has a natural supersymmetry . to construct this supersymmetric model , we begin by defining the supersymmetric charge by the product of a constraint function and a new degree of freedom : @xmath60 this looks like a lagrange multiplier term in an action meant to impose the constraints @xmath48 and",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath59 and @xmath58 are the lagrange multipliers .",
    "however , here we view these as degrees of freedom that satisfy their own poisson bracket relations .",
    "indeed we can construct the supersymmetric hamiltonian using the poisson bracket @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes a poisson bracket .",
    "for this equation to be true , it is necessary for @xmath58 and @xmath59 to be grassmann numbers so that @xmath63 is grassmann odd and @xmath64 does not vanish by the normal antisymmetry of poisson brackets .",
    "we also used @xmath65 .",
    "if we choose the remaining poisson brackets to be @xmath66 then we obtain the simple relation @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the first term and the second and third terms make up @xmath69 of eq .",
    "[ eq : hphonon ] .",
    "this defines the poisson bracket to be@xcite @xmath70 which is symmetric if @xmath71 and @xmath72 are both grassmann odd and antisymmetric otherwise .",
    "finally , we see that @xmath73 so the two observables form a closed superalgebra .",
    "so we can promote the phonon problem to a supersymmetric problem of bosonic phonons and fermionic phoninos where the phoninos satisfy a clifford algebra with metrics @xmath11 and @xmath9 and the phonino hamiltonian is determined by the constraint matrix @xmath74 where @xmath53 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : phononcmatrix ] .    note , here we have chosen to study phonons classically using grassmann numbers . in this sense",
    "we follow one of the original motivations to introduce grassmann numbers into classical mechanics : to construct simpler - than - field - theory supersymmetry models@xcite .",
    "the use of classical mechanics here , however , is just to connect with the history of theories of balls and springs and is not necessary as we will discuss section [ sec : topologicalprotection ] .",
    "furthermore , our analysis of the model presented below will be informed by the use of supersymmetry in quantum mechanics ( see ref . for a review ) , because it is another simpler - than - field - theory supersymmetry model . however , unlike quantum mechanics , the above model is a many - body supersymmetric lattice model , one not so different from the lattice model of a supersymmetric topological superconductor studied in ref . .",
    "in the linearized limit the two hamiltonians become @xmath75 and @xmath76 where we used @xmath77 . in this limit then , the phonons and the phoninos are decoupled and the hamiltonians are quadratic .",
    "we therefore have a model we can apply to real systems since it contains the correct phonon eigenvalue problem .",
    "it is not so obvious , however , what we can learn by introducing the phoninos . to settle this , we need to directly study the different eigenvalue problems .",
    "to study the eigenvalue problems of @xmath78 , we need to solve the corresponding equations of motion .",
    "the first order in time differential equations for the phonons are @xmath79 and for the phoninos are @xmath80 remarkably , the phonino equations of motion are the square - rooted hamiltonian matrix @xmath40 introduced by kane and lubensky . the constraint matrix @xmath53 and @xmath40",
    "are therefore related in the supersymmetric model by one entering the hamiltonian quadratic form and the other by the corresponding equations of motion .",
    "we will also find it useful to work with the second derivative in time equations of motion : @xmath81 from these , we see that , @xmath17 , @xmath82 and @xmath59 all obey the same equations of motion . @xmath58 obeys a distinctly different equation .",
    "we also can determine that each equation has two types of eigenmodes .",
    "for the @xmath17-type equations , all modes either have zero eigenvalue and are in the null space of @xmath16 or they have finite eigenvalues .",
    "there are no modes with zero eigenvalue that satisfy @xmath83 .",
    "this is because such a mode would satisfy @xmath84 with @xmath85 and violate the assumption that @xmath36 is a positive definite matrix . for a similar reason ,",
    "the @xmath58 equation has two modes types , those with zero eigenvalue in the nullspace of @xmath56 and those with finite eigenvalues .",
    "we can of course proceed by solving these equations separately , but this would not give us any insight into how the phoninos can help us understand the phonons .",
    "instead , lets proceed by studying supersymmetry transformations and reduce the problem to solving only the parts not related by supersymmetry .",
    "the supersymmetric charge provides us with a map between the phase space observables with an even number of phonino coordinates ( grassmann even ) and those with an odd number ( grassmann odd ) .",
    "the single particle phonon modes which are linear combinations of @xmath17 and @xmath6 are in the even group while the single particle phonino modes which are linear combinations of @xmath59 and @xmath58 are in the odd group .",
    "the map @xmath86 we can construct from @xmath63 sends an observable from the even sector to the odd sector or vice versa by inserting it into the location of the @xmath87 .",
    "this map has a special relationship with the equations of motion : time evolution of the mapped observable is the same as the unmapped observable .",
    "for example , @xmath88 is a phonino observable that obeys the equations of motion @xmath89 which is the equations of motion for @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , the phonon observables @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 obey the @xmath6 , @xmath59 and @xmath58 equations respectively .",
    "computing these poisson brackets explicitly , we see that they are @xmath93 so it would seem that supersymmetry is too powerful a symmetry , that the phonino problem is equivalent to the phonon problem ( and therefore uninteresting ) .    to study these relationships in more detail , lets now take linear combinations of phase space observables .",
    "if @xmath94 is an eigenmode of the @xmath6 equation then it obeys @xmath95 now if @xmath96 so the @xmath97 is in the ( left ) nullspace of @xmath56 , then it is an eigenvector with frequency @xmath98 .",
    "if this is not the case , it is an eigenvector with a finite frequency as discussed above .",
    "now lets map this to a linear combination of @xmath58 s using @xmath63 : @xmath99 if @xmath97 therefore corresponds to a zero mode , it gets annihilated by this map . only the finite frequency modes",
    "therefore actually pass from the @xmath6 eigenmode problem to the @xmath58 eigenmode problem .",
    "however , for the finite mode case , notice that the mapped observable is a linear combination whose coefficients obey @xmath100 so it is a ( left ) eigenvector of the @xmath58 differential equation with the same eigenvalue it had in the @xmath6 differential equation before it was mapped . mapped",
    "observables therefore carry their eigenvalue with them .    extending this study to each of the four differential equations and breaking their set of eigenvectors into two groups , the finite and the zero eigenvalue modes , we have constructed fig .",
    "[ fig : phononqmap ] that graphically depicts all the different relationships . in it",
    "an arrow represents a function mapping the set of eigenmodes at its tail to the set of eigenmodes at its head . if two different paths exist between any two sets , one going from one set to the other and the other going the reverse direction , then the two sets are isomorphic and in particular have the same number of eigenmodes . in this way",
    ", we see that the number of finite energy eigenmodes are the same for all differential equations , just their zero modes are different .    ''",
    "is the supersymmetry map .",
    "notice @xmath63 does not map zero mode eigenstates from @xmath6 to @xmath58 and from @xmath58 to @xmath17 .",
    "since all arrows represent maps of unique elements to unique elements , if a path of arrows exists from one set of modes to another and another path exists from that set of modes back to the first then the two sets of modes are isomorphic . for finite modes ,",
    "any two sets of eigenstates have such paths relating them so they are all isomorphic to each other . for zero modes , only the @xmath17 , @xmath59 and @xmath6 sets of eigenstates",
    "are isomorphic .",
    "the @xmath58 set is different and hence the phonino problem has a different set of zero modes from the phonon problem .",
    "note this figure follows the rules of an olog@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] '' is the supersymmetry map .",
    "notice @xmath63 does not map zero mode eigenstates from @xmath6 to @xmath58 and from @xmath58 to @xmath17 .",
    "since all arrows represent maps of unique elements to unique elements , if a path of arrows exists from one set of modes to another and another path exists from that set of modes back to the first then the two sets of modes are isomorphic . for finite modes ,",
    "any two sets of eigenstates have such paths relating them so they are all isomorphic to each other . for zero modes , only the @xmath17 , @xmath59 and @xmath6 sets of eigenstates are isomorphic .",
    "the @xmath58 set is different and hence the phonino problem has a different set of zero modes from the phonon problem .",
    "note this figure follows the rules of an olog@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    now , with the above analysis of the eigenmodes , we are in a position to understand the topological index associated with a supersymmetric theory . as pointed out by witten ( and often called the `` witten index '' ) the total number of boson modes minus the total number of fermion modes ( @xmath101 where @xmath102 for a boson mode , and @xmath103 for a fermion mode ) is a topological invariant . applying this to the single particle sector we have @xmath104 but if we break down the count of zero modes into the four groups of two types of modes , we have @xmath105 where we used fig . [",
    "fig : phononqmap ] to establish that the number of finite modes @xmath106 is the same between all modes types while @xmath107 is the same only between @xmath17 , @xmath59 and @xmath6 and is in general different from the number of @xmath58 zero modes , @xmath108 . to derive these results",
    ", we heavily relied on the positive definiteness of @xmath9 and @xmath36 for if this were not the case , more modes could fail to be mapped by @xmath63 .",
    "so the witten index of supersymmetry , when applied to the single particle sector valid for the linearized theory , is identical to the maxwell - calladine index but its derivation is directly built on eigenvalue problems rather than directly on the properties of the matrix @xmath16 .",
    "the witten index is useful in a supersymmetric theory because it dictates whether there must be a zero mode . if @xmath109 there must be @xmath110 bosonic ( phonon ) zero modes . if @xmath111 there must be @xmath112 fermionic ( phonino ) zero modes which here must be self stress modes .",
    "so long as @xmath113 then , supersymmetry can exist in the `` ground state '' for there is then a zero mode that satisfies @xmath114 ( in the quantum language ) .",
    "however , if @xmath47 then without explicitly breaking supersymmetry one can remove all zero modes .",
    "then there are no states satisfying @xmath114 and supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in the ground state . remarkably , an isostatic lattice has both @xmath47 for periodic boundary conditions and all zero modes gapped ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "so isostatic lattices are an example spontaneous susy breaking .    finally , we need to comment on the question of how the above supersymmetry is related to the quantum mechanics - like supersymmetry of the square rooted equations of motion ( eq . [ eq : sqrtedeom ] ) pointed out by kane and lubensky .",
    "this symmetry is a supersymmetry between @xmath59 modes and @xmath58 modes ( both of which are fermionic here ) and has an associated topological index which is numerically the same index as the single particle witten index discussed above and the maxwell - calladine index .",
    "so the phonon problem appears to have two different supersymmetries , one at the full phase space level that we discuss above and the other at the level of the equations of motion of the linearized fermions that related different fermion modes to each other ( quantum mechanics - like susy need not always relate bosonic modes to fermionic modes ) .    in summary",
    ", the supersymmetry model has brought all mathematical objects mentioned so far under one umbrella .",
    "the supersymmetric theory has the phonon hamiltoinan , the two metrics @xmath9 and @xmath36 play a central role as they determine the commutation relations of the fermions , the phonino hamiltonian is determined by the constraint matrix @xmath53 and its corresponding equations of motion is the square - rooted hamiltonian @xmath40 .",
    "finally , the topological index is determined by the supersymmetry relations between the various eigenmodes .",
    "lastly , it suggests that the specialness of the balls and springs description is the requirement that it is supersymmetric .",
    "if we break this specialness , if we explicitly break the supersymmetry , then most of the mathematical objects contained in the theory loose their meaning . in this way",
    ", i argue that the topological structure of isostatic lattices identified by kane and lubensky is susy protected .",
    "the previous results show that models of phonons built on constraint functions like the extension @xmath4 of a spring from its equilibrium length have a topological index tied to their equations of motion by a supersymmetric relationship with phoninos .",
    "this index guarantees the existence of zero modes from topology ( even in the absence of a continuous symmetry ) much like goldstone s theorem guarantees the existence of zero modes from spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "here we discuss the question of to what extent this topological property is robust .      for the most part , we worked in the classical limit where phonons are actually lattice vibrations .",
    "if we quantize it , then we convert poisson brackets to commutators or anticommutators such as @xmath116 = i\\delta_{i\\alpha}^{j\\beta}$ ] and @xmath117 . quantizing the supersymmetric charge",
    "@xmath118 then gives the supersymmetric hamiltonian @xmath119 this is identical in form to the classical case .",
    "a similar correspondence between the non - linear forms of the classical and quantum model also holds .",
    "so the main results of this paper hold in both the classical and quantum forms and are not restricted to semi - classical or classical regimes .",
    "since the metrics @xmath36 and @xmath9 entering the phonon problem are not present in the respective topological indices , the topological protection holds if these undergo a distortion so long as they remain positive definite matrices . in particular , the topological index holds if we stretch and distort the lattice as was used extensively in the discovery of weyl phonon modes in ref . .",
    "let us first address this question for the non - linear supersymmetry models before returning to the problem of purely non - linear phonons in the absence of phoninos .    in the presence of non - linearities , the eigenmodes of the system are no longer linear combinations of single particle observables .",
    "instead , they become a linear combination of all multiparticle observables . as a result , the witten index restricted to the single particle sector",
    "looses its meaning but the full index @xmath120 still holds because @xmath63 still maps multiparticle bosonic observables to a multiparticle fermionic observables . to get a sence of this full set of observables",
    ", we have considered the two - particle sector .",
    "this consists of bosonic observables of types @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 and fermionic observables of types @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 . counting all of these two different two particle observables , noting that squares of grassmann observables vanish ( i.e. @xmath131 ) i obtain after simplifying @xmath132",
    "if @xmath133 as in the isostatic lattice case , we see this also vanishes .",
    "since the index for the one - particle and two - particle sectors vanishes , likely the total sum over all sectors relevant for the many body non - linear problem also vanishes .",
    "so the topological protection remains in effect for the full non - linear supersymmetric problem .    with this technical extension ,",
    "we see that the non - linear models are also topological .",
    "since they consist now of majorana fermions coupled to phonons , they could in principle be realized in a carefully engineered superconductor . in practice , however , they may prove to be more useful as a means of gaining theoretical insight into `` symmetry protected topological order '' in the presence of interacting fermions which does not make use of k - theory@xcite , chern - simons quantum field theory@xcite or supercohomology@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the salient feature of the non - linear problem is that the phonons are now coupled to the phoninos",
    ". we can no longer think about the added fermionic degrees of freedom as a device to construct a topological index .",
    "so , if the fermions are absent the supersymmetry is lost and with it the topological protection .",
    "this statement , however , is about the microscopic physics . it may very well be that the full non - linear phonon problem has the same low energy long distance physics as the corresponding supersymmetric non - linear phonon . after all , it is the physics close to the ground state which we used to build the model of balls and springs from constraint functions .",
    "it is therefore possible that the susy breaking terms are irrelevant in the renormalization group sense .",
    "if so , the topological protection may nevertheless emerge in the low energy limit .",
    "the models discussed in this paper are all `` toy '' models in that they correspond to useful simplifications of the actual phonon microscopic physics but in any real system , there will be perturbations that are not of the simple form .",
    "for example , the general quadratic phonon potential @xmath134 is not that of balls and springs ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the supersymmetry can therefore be thought of as a symmetry emerging from the ` toy - ness ' of the model .",
    "we can speculate on what this might mean .",
    "the extent to which the toy model captures the full physics of a real material is likely the extent to which the supersymmetry will be obeyed .",
    "in particular , if supersymmetry demands gappless phonon edge modes in a system with gapped bulk phonon modes , these edge modes would likely be gapped by perturbations violating the toy - like property of balls and springs and the size of the gap is likely related to the strength of these non - toy - like perturbations .",
    "we can extend the above phonon discussion to magnons ( or other similar systems ) by recognizing its essential ingredient : constraints .",
    "the phonon problem is built on the local - in - configuration space condition that the extensions @xmath4 vanish in the ground state .",
    "since a ground state also requires a vanishing momenta @xmath6 , we see that the phonon problem is a quadratic form in the set of local - in - phase space constraints on the ground state .",
    "to extend to magnons , we therefore need models built around local - in - phase space constraints that define a ground state magnetic ordering pattern .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of such a constraint in a magnetic system is the vanishing total ( classical ) spin of a nearest neighbor bond in the nel state of the square lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "each nearest neighbor bond @xmath3 has a pair of sites @xmath136 that satisfies @xmath137 .",
    "here each @xmath138 is a dynamical spin vector satisfying angular momentum poisson brackets @xmath139 and lives in a spherical @xmath140-dimensional phase space .",
    "such a condition is directly analogous to a motionless unstreatched spring with vanishing extension @xmath15 and momenta @xmath14 , @xmath141 .",
    "so we can follow our phonon discussion and use the condition @xmath142 to write down the susy charge @xmath143 and susy hamiltonian @xmath144 choosing @xmath145 a positive definite symmetric matrix makes the first term a typical quadratic spin model with @xmath142 for a ground state ( e.g. the case @xmath146 is just the heisenberg model ) .",
    "this makes the @xmath147 grassmann variables obeying a clifford algebra just like we found for the phonon problem .",
    "additionally , @xmath148 follows from @xmath149 above and defines the fermion hamiltonian again as dirac s constraint matrix .",
    "we can then expand about a ground state to linear order using @xmath150 with @xmath151 the phase space coordinates representing deviations of the spin on site @xmath8 from its ground state value .",
    "this renders @xmath152 constant and decouples the two terms in @xmath78 .",
    "linearizing allows us to demote the magninos described by @xmath147 to fictitious particles whose use is to reveal the implications of the supersymmetry just like the case of the phoninos .",
    "however , the equations of motion of these magninos does not give us the `` square - rooted '' hamiltonain for it is @xmath153 which , when squared , is not the magnon equations of motion .",
    "so the structure of the square - rooted hamiltonian and its associated quantum mechanics - like supersymmetry does nt apply here .",
    "thus , by starting from the ground state condition @xmath142 we obtain the same structure as the phonon problem which presumably has a witten index @xmath110 that can tell us about its zero modes without solving the equations of motion .",
    "the above nel state bond constraint @xmath154 is an application of the susy phonon problem to unfrustrated antiferromagnets .",
    "it readily generalizes to the ferromagnetic case which has a vanishing difference of spin vectors on each bond ( @xmath155 ) provided we draw arrows on each bond to specify which of the two sites of nearest neighbor bond @xmath3 enters @xmath154 with a negative sign .",
    "it also readily generalizes to other bi - partite lattices such as the cubic lattice and the honeycombe lattice .",
    "writing down the topological index expected for these generalizations will therefore allow us to determine if an analog of isostatic phonons exists and also how we may use it to study the loss of magnetic order .    for each case",
    ", we can guess the form of the topological index @xmath156 the last line here is not a guess , it follows from the previous line by the fundamental theorem of linear algebra as before . presumably , if @xmath157 , there must be a finite number of magnon zero modes and if it is negative a finite number of magnino modes .",
    "we will discuss the meaning and correctness of this statement below .",
    "but assuming it is correct for the present discussion , we see that essentially all unfrustrated magnets have @xmath158 . only dimerized systems which have two sites for each bond or trimerized systems with _ two bonds _ for each trimer have non - negative @xmath159 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : unfrustratednu ] ) .",
    "the best case with connected sites is the one dimensional chain with @xmath160 and @xmath161 for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a similar best case holds for bond percolation on the square lattice where at threshold @xmath162@xcite .",
    "so for unfrustrated magnets , the topological structure imposed by supersymmetry does nt demand any magnon zero modes .     becomes increasingly negative with increasing chain length going negative for four or more spins , essentially all unfrustrated magnetic systems will have a negative topological index .",

    "now @xmath248 is a @xmath249 antihermetian matrix : @xmath250 choosing @xmath235 a 6x6 identity matrix so that @xmath251 obey canonical commutation relations then allows us to diagonalize this matrix .",

    "this seems difficult for magnetic systems for each site naturally has its own constraints ( such as unit length spin vectors ) in addition to the bond constraints .",

    "so frustration enables a wide variety of models to explore the impact of the full range of @xmath110 values on the ordering tendencies of the spins .",

    "perhaps most striking is the existence of a new phase of magnetism which is on the verge of magnetic collapse that we will here refer to as isostatic magnetism .",
    "we can understand the existence of this phase in simple terms as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isomagnetism ] . first consider the three different mechanical structures , the square , the square with one diagonal beam and the square with two diagonal beams we see three different forms of rigidity : floppy , fragile , and firm .",

    "the square with one diagonal brace is fragile because though it is rigid , if you cut / break any of the braces , it becomes floppy .",

    "the square is the analog of the firm mechanical structure : after imposing @xmath314 on three of its four sides , the fourth side is redundant . removing one bond would not destroy the nel order of its ground state .",
    "the triangle is the example of the fragile mechanical structure .",
    "all three constraints @xmath315 that define its ground state are needed to set the spins to be 120@xmath316 apart ( up to global spin rotations ) .",

    "isostatic magnetism is fragile .",
    "remarkably , since we have already the other two cases , `` floppy '' magnetism in the form of highly frustrated magnets and `` firm '' magnetism for most other magnetic systems , it may just be a matter of time to identify isostatic magnetism at least within some temperature range .",
    "one group of materials that may contain this novel magnetism is the family of distorted kagome antiferromagnets .",
    "an undistorted ideal kagome antiferromagnet has @xmath47 but many zero modes .",

    "similarly , one can add a `` bond magnetic field '' @xmath322 via a term in the hamiltonian @xmath323 and there must exist @xmath322 such that no net field is experienced by a spin to linear order in the displacements of the spins from their ground states .",
    "we know actually that there are at least @xmath324 of these from the topological index which here is @xmath325 . because we include spin rotation invariance , there are two zero modes and so @xmath326 demands @xmath327 . if @xmath3 labels bonds cyclically around the square , three of these six modes span @xmath328 .",

    "so self field modes exist and extend our understanding of the theory of magnetism .",
    "actually , we can understand what an experimentalist could achieve with a knowledge of self field modes in analogy with the self stress modes .",
    "self stress modes have been studied at least as far back as eshelby s 1957 paper@xcite who emphasized the engineering importance of self stresses in an elastic medium with inhomogeneities .",
    "more recently they have been understood as a means of selective mechanical failure of metamaterials@xcite . in a @xmath47 lattice with one self stress mode and one zero mode located in different regions ,",
    "a load was shown to cause mechanical failure exactly at the self stress mode bonds .",
    "similarly , an applied field that corresponds to a self field mode should cause a spin flip .",
    "indeed , in the case above for the square with a field @xmath336 applied , we see that the spins will flip due to the non - zero energy @xmath337 caused by the non - linearities .",
    "the other two self field modes not discussed in detail similarly cause a spin flip , just not all spins flip in those cases .",
    "so such self field modes correspond to spin flip transitions and their identification in the constraint matrix eigenvalue problem may enable the discovery of a variety of such spin flip transitions .",
    "in this paper , we have recognized a supersymmetry in the structure of hamiltonians that energetically impose local constraints on their ground states .",
    "this allowed us to formally connect recent development in the theory of phonons to a wider range of systems including frustrated and unfrustrated magnets .",

    "[ fig : irmn3 ] .",
    "indeed , the lattice is better thought of as side - sharing triangles in three dimensions instead of layers of kagome planes . with eight triangles in the unit cell , the dominant heisenberg term in its hamiltonian can be written @xmath342 where @xmath343 is the total spin on each triangle .",
    "we therefore have a topological index @xmath344 ( since there are 8/3 triangles per spin ) .",
    "we can contrast this to say an unfrustrated antiferromagnet on the cubic lattice with three bonds in the unit cell and @xmath345 .",
    "but upon closer inspection , we should be careful with such a comparison . in irmn@xmath2 ,",

    "<S> i generalize the theory of phonon topological band structures of isostatic lattices to frustrated antiferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> i achieve this with a discovery of a many - body supersymmetry ( susy ) in the phonon problem of balls and springs and its connection to local constraints satisfied by ground states . </S>",
    "<S> the witten index of the susy model demands the maxwell - calladine index of mechanical structures . </S>",
    "<S> `` spontaneous supersymmetry breaking '' is identified as the need to gap all modes in the bulk to create the topological isostatic lattice state . </S>",
    "<S> since ground states of magnetic systems also satisfy local constraint conditions ( such as the vanishing of the total spin on a triangle ) i identify a similar susy structure for many common models of antiferromagnets including the square , triangluar , kagome , pyrochlore nearest neighbor antiferromagnets , and the @xmath0 square lattice antiferromagnet . remarkably , the kagome family of antiferromagnets is the analog of topological isostatic lattices among this collections of models . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a solid state realization of the theory of phonon topological band structure may be found in frustrated magnetic materials .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , kane and lubensky@xcite ( kl ) identified topological properties of isostatic lattice phonons . </S>",
    "<S> they achieved this by discovering a topological index governing mechanical structures by building on calladine s work@xcite and further utilizing a dirac - like square - root of the phonon equations of motion , a problem to which they could apply the theory of topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , they showed the existence of lattices with gapped phonons for periodic boundary conditions that must have gapless phonons with open boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to wonder if this striking effect is more general and they conclude their study with `` finally , it will be interesting to explore connections with theories of frustrated magnetism@xmath1 . '' </S>",
    "<S> where reference 48 is my study@xcite identifying topological gauge dynamics of the zero modes of classical kagome antiferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> this paper s goal is to make this connection and use it to generalize kl theory beyond phonons .    </S>",
    "<S> the kl theory of isostatic lattices is a different branch of topological phases from the theory of topological band insulators . following the original discovery of topological insulators , topological properties of boson band structures </S>",
    "<S> have been studied for a wide variety of systems including phonons@xcite , photons@xcite , acoustic phononic crystals@xcite and magnons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these systems achieve their topological properties in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking and are built directly from the physics of the integer quantum hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , kl s theory of isostatic phonons is time reversal symmetric and `` purely geometric in nature''@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a connection to the integer quantum hall effect is made only after a dirac - like square - rooting procedure of the equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore presents a new direction in the theory of topological phases .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , though its may not apply directly to solid state phonons because they are mechanically stable , the kl theory has already seen a variety of applications due to its insight into the general phenomena of mechanical collapse . </S>",
    "<S> these include some topological aspects of the jamming and rigidity percolation transitions@xcite , metamaterials made from beams and pins@xcite , and , remarkably , origami@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ref . has also taken it beyond the linearized level and discovered solitons that can propagate freely in the bulk of the isostatic state . </S>",
    "<S> so , given the fundamental insight it provides , any extension of kl theory to a new class of systems , including extensions that go beyond the linearized limit , is likely to shed new light on those systems .    in this light , frustrated magnets and/or </S>",
    "<S> highly frustrated magnets are a prime target for an extension of kl theory . </S>",
    "<S> they are magnets not only `` on the verge of collapse '' but also those that have already `` collapsed '' . </S>",
    "<S> here collapsing is the analog of destabilizing the magnetic ordered state into a paramagnetic state such as a quantum spin liquid or valence bond solid . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of materials including the organics , kagome family and pyrochlores are heavily studied for this reason@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , highly geometrically frustrated magnets have a form of accidental degeneracy that results from a special feature of the spin hamiltoinan@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this frustration is toy - like ( fine tuned ) perhaps in a similar way that balls and springs are toy - like versions of a general theory of phonons . </S>",
    "<S> so if kl theory were applicable to frustrated magnets , this generalization might apply to many already realized solid state materials .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the key to generalizing kl theory to other systems lies in connecting it to an abstract theoretical framework that takes the form of a many - body supersymmetric ( susy ) structure that extends the description of balls and springs . </S>",
    "<S> the new fermionic degrees of freedom , that i dub `` phoninos '' , are superpartners to phonons and are governed by the kl theory s square - rooted equations of motion . for linearized phonons , the two sets of degrees of freedom are decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> the phoninos therefore need not be real degrees of freedom but just reflect the specialness of balls and springs compared to a more general theory of phonons . </S>",
    "<S> i then show that the topological index identified in kl theory is demanded by the witten index@xcite of susy . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion was reached by ref . in the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , spontaneous susy breaking here is just the need to gap all modes in the bulk to create the topological state ( as could be the case for topological superconductors@xcite ) . finally , we discuss what protects this topology including the role of quantum effects and non - linearities .    </S>",
    "<S> i then apply the same many - body susy construction to the case of magnons . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out susy is found for both unfrustrated and frustrated magnons for either case has ground states that satisfy local constraints and the susy construction is built on these constraints . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , kagome magninos are governed by a hamiltonian which is the dirac s constraint matrix@xcite studied in ref . and is related through susy to the ordinary kagome magnon problem . the witten index in this case </S>",
    "<S> is then shown to vanish for periodic boundary conditions but not for open boundary conditions demonstrating that kagome magnons are the analog of the isostatic lattice of kl theory if we can gap all their modes without changing topology such as in a distorted kagome crystal . </S>",
    "<S> such a phase we call isostatic magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by identifying some of the new physical phenomena predicted by these formal development : the design of magnets by exploiting weaknesses in isostatic magnetism such as through a rich set of magnetic field induced spin flip transitions that we call `` self field modes '' ; and an application of the ideas here to the origin of the industrial strength of mn@xmath2ir ( why it is a robust antiferromagnet ) ; the potential application of topological band theory of electrons to magninos in the isostatic magnetic phase and via susy to magnons ; the study of the loss of magnetic order via isostatic magnetism which can be viewed as a classical critical point between magnetic order and a classical spin liquid@xcite / cooperative paramagnet@xcite . </S>"
