    "the interference channel with a relay ( icr ) is a canonical network model in which a relay helps two independent transmitters , tx@xmath0 and tx@xmath1 , in sending messages to their corresponding receivers , rx@xmath0 and rx@xmath1 , simultaneously over a shared channel .",
    "the icr provides design insights and performance bounds on cooperation strategies for wireless networks with interference .",
    "the icr was first studied in @xcite and has since been the focus of considerable research .",
    "inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of the two - user icr with additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) were characterized in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in @xcite an achievable region",
    "was obtained by employing a rate - splitting scheme at the transmitters , a decode - and - forward ( df ) strategy at the relay , and a backward decoding scheme at the receivers .",
    "the work in @xcite used the compress - and - forward ( cf ) strategy at the relay to obtain an achievable rate region .",
    "outer bounds for the awgn - icr were obtained by applying the cut - set bound in @xcite , @xcite , and by using a potent relay in combination with genie - aided methods in @xcite .",
    "capacity regions for ergodic phase - fading and for ergodic rayleigh fading icrs in the strong interference regime were characterized in @xcite for the case in which the source - relay links are good , i.e. , when df achieves capacity .",
    "the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt ) , first introduced in @xcite , characterizes the fundamental tradeoff between rate and reliability for multiple - antenna channels in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime . in general , employing multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) schemes allows higher rates compared to single - antenna schemes .",
    "however , these schemes require the physical dimensions of the nodes in a network to be large enough such that ( s.t . ) it is practical to mount a multiple - antenna array on each node .    in recent studies",
    "it was shown that some of the benefits of mimo from the dmt perspective can be gained through user cooperation rather than using physical multiple - antenna arrays . in @xcite ,",
    "the dmt characteristics of several relaying configurations were derived for both half - duplex ( hd ) and full - duplex ( fd ) relaying in two scenarios : ( 1 ) a clustered scenario , in which the relay nodes are clustered either with the source or with the destination ( the channel between the nodes in the cluster is modeled as an awgn channel ) , and ( 2 ) a non - clustered scenario , in which all channel coefficients matrices have independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) rayleigh - distributed entries . specifically , @xcite first studied the dmt of fd multiple - antenna single - relay channels and showed that while the df scheme is optimal for single - antenna relay channels , it is suboptimal for multiple - antenna relay channels . on the other hand ,",
    "cf was shown to be optimal for the mimo relay channel over the whole range of multiplexing gains , and for both clustered and non - clustered relay networks using either hd or fd relay nodes .",
    "finally , @xcite compared different cooperation strategies and models against conventional mimo schemes and concluded that in many scenarios relaying can not achieve the same dmt as non - virtual mimo systems . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that quantize - map - and - forward ( qmf ) achieves the optimal dmt for certain configurations of the hd relay channel without channel state information ( csi ) at the relay node .",
    "dmt analysis of the two - hop two - way mimo relay channel was presented in @xcite , which showed that in such a scenario cf at the relay is optimal .",
    "the work in @xcite also proposed a dynamic cf protocol for the one - way multi - hop mimo relay channel with a hd relay node , and showed that this scheme achieves the optimal dmt .",
    "the dmt of the single - antenna block rayleigh fading interference channel ( ic ) was studied in @xcite for the scenario in which csi is available both at the receivers ( rx - csi ) and at the transmitters ( tx - csi ) , and in @xcite for the scenario with only rx - csi . in @xcite , it was shown that in the very strong interference regime , successive decoding with interference cancellation is dmt optimal . since for the ergodic fading case , using",
    "the approach of @xcite achieves the capacity region of the ic @xcite , it follows that the same strategy is optimal from both dmt and capacity perspectives .",
    "additionally , for general interference regimes , @xcite proposed a transmission scheme using a han - kobayashi @xcite type superposition encoding , in which each receiver jointly decodes the common messages from both transmitters , and the private message from its intended transmitter .",
    "this scheme was shown to be dmt optimal in the strong and in the very strong interference regimes , and over a certain range of multiplexing gains .",
    "the dmt region of the block rayleigh fading gaussian mimo icr was studied in @xcite for the case where all links have the same exponential behavior as a function of the snr . in @xcite ,",
    "an outer bound on the dmt was derived using the cut - set theorem , and an achievable dmt was characterized using cf at the relay subject to probabilistic conditions .",
    "the generalized degrees of freedom ( gdof ) of the icr was studied in @xcite where new outer bounds on the achievable gdof of the icr were derived using genie - aided methods .",
    "the work @xcite also proposed a _ functional decode - and - forward _ ( fdf ) strategy which was shown to achieve the optimal gdof of the icr given some constraints on the gains of the links in the channel .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that relaying can increase the gdof compared to the ic .      in this work we present results on the dmt region of the single - antenna icr considering both fd and hd relaying .",
    "we consider the scenario in which the receivers have perfect rx - csi , but there is no tx - csi at the sources .",
    "we allow the direct link gains , the interfering link gains , the source - relay link gains , and the relay - destinations link gains to scale differently as exponential functions of the @xmath2 , and focus on characterizing the effects of the relationship between interference and cooperation on the dmt region .",
    "the channel model is symmetric in the sense that the scaling of the corresponding links at both pairs is identical .",
    "the main contributions of this work are :    1 .   four achievable dmt regions are derived based on the cf , df , and the hd and fd af relaying schemes . for each scheme ,",
    "we analyze the effect of the cross - link gains ( interference ) , the relay - destination link gains ( cooperation ) , and the source - relay links gains on the achievable dmt region .",
    "we derive sufficient conditions under which each of the schemes df and cf achieves the _",
    "optimal dmt_. based on the optimality results , we further obtain sufficient conditions under which the icr has the same dmt as that of two parallel single - relay channels .",
    "thus , the relay assistance to one pair _ does not degrade _ the dmt performance at the other pair , and _ a single relay is simultaneously dmt - optimal for two separate communicating pairs sharing one channel_. 3 .   for the af scheme",
    ", we derive conditions under which each pair in the icr has a dmt which is equal to the _ best known _",
    "dmt for the _ relay channel _ with af relaying .",
    "we compare the dmt of the icr with that of the ic , and provide sufficient conditions under which _ adding a relay to the ic strictly increases the dmt region_.    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the channel model and notation",

    "however , if the relay - destination links are not strong enough , i.e. , if @xmath137 , then the compression loss at the relay is substantial . as a result , much of the information received at the relay is not conveyed to the destinations , leading to sub - optimality of cf .",
    "it follows that the achievable dmt region of the cf - based scheme used for deriving theorem [ thm : theorem_cf ] coincides with the dmt region derived from the cut - set bound only over a strict subset of channel coefficients , _ contrary _ to the situation for the cf scheme in the single - relay channel , as observed in @xcite .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that unlike the single - relay channel , in the icr there is interference , and hence the relay - destination links should be stronger than in the case of single - relay channel in order for cf to be optimal .",

    "_ implications on the incorporation of relaying into existing wireless networks : _ an important aspect to note is that all achievable dmt regions in this paper were obtained with mutually independent codebooks .",

    "it is enough to modify only the decoding process at the receivers .",

    "this observation has motivated basing the achievable schemes employed in this work on decoding both messages at each receiver . in the weak interference regime",
    ", this decoding approach constrains the rates , and higher rates can be obtained by applying partial interference cancellation as in the well - known han - kobayashi scheme @xcite .",
    "partial interference cancellation can be incorporated into these schemes by rate - splitting at the sources combined with partial decoding and rate - splitting at the relay ( for example , this was done for cf in ( * ? ? ?",

    "note that for the ic ( without a relay ) it was shown in @xcite that when interference is weak , then partial interference cancellation leads to a larger achievable dmt region compared to jointly decoding both messages ; however , dmt optimality was demonstrated only for the strong and for the very strong interference regimes .",
    "another relevant relaying strategy is noisy network coding ( nnc ) @xcite .",
    "note that in the weak interference regime , @xcite showed that nnc may allow higher rate pairs than those achievable with cf relaying for the icr with noiseless , orthogonal relay - destinations links .",
    "thus , nnc may lead to a larger dmt region in such scenarios . in strong and in very strong interference regimes , which are the focus of this study , the receiver jointly decodes both the interference and the desired message .",
    "in such situations , when cf is dmt optimal ( see , e.g. , corollary [ cor : cf_optimallity ] ) , clearly nnc can not outperform cf .",

    "the operational significance of dmt analysis in modern wireless communications systems : _ an interesting aspect to investigate related to our dmt results for the icr is their operational significance , as was done for point - to - point mimo channels in @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite showed that in practical wideband operating scenarios with frequency diversity , link adaptation can be used to avoid outage in slowly fading channels , while in rapidly fading scenarios , hybrid automatic - repeat - request ( harq ) provides sufficient protection from outage .",
    "thus , in both rapidly and slowly fading channels , the transmission scheme should utilize the available antennas for increasing the information rate ( i.e. , multiplexing gain ) rather than for decreasing the probability of outage ( i.e. , diversity gain ) .",
    "note however , that the analysis in @xcite does not easily extend to the icr studied in this paper for two reasons : first , we assume no transmitter csi and no feedback , which precludes link adaptation as well as harq .",
    "in addition , our setup is a virtual mimo channel , and hence , even with transmitter csi everywhere , the ability to do link adaptation and harq over virtual links is not straightforward . furthermore , the relay also complicates the analysis as it introduces multiple hops which were not present in @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that as in @xcite , if there is transmitter csi and/or feedback in our model , then techniques such as link adaptation and harq will reduce or eliminate the need to use degrees of freedom for diversity in most settings , and hence typical operating scenarios will use most degrees of freedom for multiplexing .",
    "making this conjecture rigorous , however , is a topic of future work .",
    "[ sec : summary ] in this work we studied the dmt performance of single - antenna gaussian icrs .",
    "we derived four achievable dmt regions based on cf , df , and af at the relay .",
    "additionally , we derived conditions on the channel coefficients under which the optimal dmt is achieved with cf and with df . in these scenarios , we showed that the optimal dmt of the icr is the same as the optimal dmt for two parallel interference - free relay channels which means that a single relay can be dmt - optimal for both communicating pairs simultaneously , and that interference does not degrade the dmt performance when these conditions are satisfied .",
    "for the af strategy we characterized scenarios in which the achievable dmt of the icr is the same as the best dmt for two parallel , af - based relay channels , and we showed that a single relay can assist both pairs to achieve this dmt simultaneously .",
