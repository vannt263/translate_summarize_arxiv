    "exploratory data analysis ( eda ) is an approach , contrast to classical approach and bayes theory , which allows the data itself to reveal its underlying structure and model [ 1 ] . in particular , time series analysis ( tsa ) , treats every experimental data set as a group of subsequent observations in time \\{@xmath2 } of a random variable x ( measurand ) .",
    "this technique has been recently applied to the analysis of experimental measurements collected in metrological laboratories in an attempt to clarify the role of serially correlated data with stochastic characteristics with regard to more realistic measurement uncertainty estimation ( see papers from witt t.j .",
    "et al , zhang n.f .",
    "et al ) . via these analysis methods",
    "it has been shown that if measurements are autocorrelated then the usual classical variance as expressed through the standard deviation of the mean of a set of repeated measurements can lead to an underestimation of the measurement uncertainty [ 2,3 ] .",
    "an alternative approach for the variance calculation of autocorrelated measurements has been proposed by allan d.w . [ 4 ] and used thoroughly by witt t.j . in the case of voltage measurements [ 5,6,7 ] .    in this work ,",
    "a variety of tsa methods are being introduced and used [ 8 ] in order to best analyze univariate time series of observations collected in equally spaced time intervals .",
    "these data were obtained in an attempt to characterize the performance of a newly commissioned mass comparator for weighing in air .",
    "eventually it will be used for the determination of the mass of density artifacts such as si spheres .",
    "the applied methods include both time and frequency domain techniques such as the construction of lag plots , the use of the auto - correlation function ( acf ) , the study of power spectral density ( psd ) [ 1,9 ] and the two - sample or allan variance [ 10 ] . more specifically , lag plots can reveal possible underlying data structures depending on the observed data pattern . the analysis of the psd can identify possible system resonances and by employing noise power law models [ 9 ] the type of noise present in the measured signal can , at least qualitatively , be determined .",
    "the allan variance , which is an alternate but equivalent time domain method , is more efficient in characterizing the variance of autocorrelated measurements and the type of noise present .",
    "finally , the autocorrelation function gives the correlation of consecutive measurements and the `` memory span '' of the system .",
    "the analysis applied aims at finding autocorrelations in the time series observations , characterizing the noise in the signal output and providing a realistic estimate of the uncertainty of correlated measurements [ 11 ] .",
    "the results from the above methods will be compared to the power law models of three well - known types of noise that exist in nature : flicker noise , white noise and random walk noise .",
    "even though the application of all the computational procedures described , is performed on a series of measurements that comes from a precision balance system , they can be applied to any electromechanical transducer system equally well with similar results .",
    "time series are an example of a stochastic or random process .",
    "mathematically , a stochastic process is an indexed collection of random variables \\{x@xmath3 : @xmath4}. when such a process is treated as a time series , then the process is indexed by time , either discrete or continuous [ 8 ] .",
    "we will specifically focus on discrete time univariate time series analysis , by using the methods presented below :      for most of the time series encountered in several scientific fields , the correlations between successive measurements have a deterministic component ( linear trend , periodic characteristics etc ) and a stochastic one .",
    "the factor that is in most cases responsible for a linear trend in a set of measurements is the ambient temperature .",
    "any deterministic trend of that kind leads to non - stationary processes ( non - stationary mean or non - stationary variance ) where the corresponding statistical properties do not converge to any particular value .    in this paper , the effects of these trends have been removed by the application of the differencing method , transforming the non - stationary time series to stationary ones . considering the first differences of the series \\{x@xmath3 } yields the same result as applying a high - pass filter to the output signal :    @xmath5    moreover , the application of the second differences filter , eliminates any periodic characteristics of the time series :    @xmath6    the purpose of the above transformation is the removal of any deterministic attributes that would screen possible stochastic characteristics of the system that produces the time series .",
    "the transformed series is thereafter examined with time domain as well as frequency domain techniques in order to reveal its stochastic character .",
    "the simplest test of extracting the correlation of two variables is the scatter plot of the dependent variable as a function of the independent one .",
    "the existence or not of a trend in such a scatter plot indicates the correlation or not between the plotted variables .",
    "the same method is applicable in a time series of events where these scatter plots are called lag plots [ 1 ] .",
    "the term lag defines a specific step in time .",
    "therefore , a lag plot is a plot of the observation x@xmath3 versus the observation x@xmath7 , t = lag interval or time , that provides evidence of the possible autocorrelations in a time series .",
    "the interpretation of the lag plot can answer to the questions of data randomness , serial correlations , identification of outliers and suggest a proper model that best describes the data set . according to the underlying structure of the data set",
    ", the lag plot can identify 4 different case studies : white noise , strong positive correlations ( random walk noise ) , weak positive correlations ( pink noise ) and negative correlations ( phase noise ) .",
    "in the case of any two random variables x , y the equation for the variance of their sum is given by equation ( 3 ) :    @xmath8=var[x]+var[y]+2cov[x , y]\\ ] ]    generalizing equation ( 3 ) for the variance of the mean of n observations , we get [ 3 ]    @xmath9}=\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}var(x_{i})+\\frac{2}{n^{2}}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{k > j}^{n}r(x_{j},x_{k})\\ ] ]    where the second term of the equation represents the autocovariance between adjacent measurements of the univariate time series of length n.    alternatively we have    @xmath9}=\\frac{1}{n}var[x]\\cdot\\left(1+\\frac{2}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{k > j}^{n}\\rho(x_{j},x_{k})\\right)\\ ] ]    where r(x@xmath10,x@xmath11 ) represents the fraction of autocovariance over variance and it is called autocorrelation . considering that autocovariance and thus autocorrelation of any two observations depends only on their in - between time lag t and not on the ordering j , k we can simply derive the autocorrelation function ( acf ) r(t ) and its estimator r(t )    @xmath12    according to the shape of the autocorrelation function [ 12 ] , the following cases can be recognized : ( i ) no specific shape , where the white noise model can be applied and data fall within 95% confidence bands of the acf plot ( or correlogram ) .",
    "( ii ) exponential or alternating positive and negative values and then decaying to zero , which is indicative of an autoregressive ( ar ) model .",
    "( iii ) one or more spikes and the rest zero , where a moving average ( ma ) model is appropriate .",
    "( iv ) decay starting after a few lags , where a mixed arma model is recommended .",
    "( v ) no decay to zero , where the process is non - stationary .",
    "the power spectrum is a very popular method used in the characterization of physical systems [ 9 ] . by simply applying a discrete fourier transform to the time series data , the real re(x(f ) ) and imaginary im(x(f ) ) parts of the fourier coefficients are derived .",
    "the periodogram is a plot of the magnitude squared of the coefficients s(f ) versus frequency f , constituting the power spectral density ( psd ) .",
    "moreover , the psd is the fourier transform of the autocorrrelation function r(t ) and that relation , given by equation ( 7 ) , makes these techniques equivalent in the analysis of time series :    @xmath13    by plotting s(f ) f in a log - log diagram , the different noise levels in the power spectrum can be estimated from the adjustment of equation ( 8) to the log - log plot .",
    "the calculation of the spectral exponent n , leads to the identification of white noise ( n=0 ) , flicker noise ( n=1 ) , random walk noise ( n=2 ) or any intermediate case 0<n<2 of colored noise .",
    "@xmath14      the allan variance or two - sample variance was first introduced by david w. allan for the evaluation of the stability of time and frequency standards [ 10 ] .",
    "the main idea behind this method lies in the relation of the dispersion that a set of measurements has , with the noise we expect to find in the output signal .",
    "the most common measure of dispersion is the classical variance , whose value decreases as the number of data points included in the calculations , increases .",
    "unfortunately this is only true in the case of truly random processes , where the variance of the mean decreases with the number n of data points    @xmath15=\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\ ] ]    in the case of autocorrelated data the above equation does not apply since there exists a possibility that the estimated variance will diverge as the number of data points increases [ 4 ] .",
    "so , we create a high - pass filter by extracting each k+1 value from its previous one k and thus we remove any possible trends , fast fluctuations or other peculiar characteristics .",
    "the allan variance is estimated at time intervals t = mt@xmath16 , where t@xmath16 is a minimum sampling time and m is usually chosen to denote powers of two . from the resulting plot of @xmath17 one can estimate the cut - off value after which the inclusion of more data points does not lead to the decrease of the variance , as classically indicated by equation ( 9 ) . in a log - log plot",
    "the allan variance is proportional to t@xmath18 and m = -n-1 , where n is the spectral exponent appearing in equation ( 8) .",
    "@xmath19    in this paper lag plots and autocorrelation function are used for the analysis of correlations in the time series while spectral analysis and allan variance are used to test time series for colored noise and estimate realistic uncertainties .",
    "it should be noted that a normal distribution of observations could nt tell between white noise and colored noise thus the mere use of histograms for the acceptance or not of equation ( 9 ) is pointless .",
    "data was obtained from characterization experiments of a newly commissioned 1kg/ 10 mg resolution mass comparator at the hellenic institute of metrology density laboratory .",
    "the principle function of this comparator will be the measurement of mass in air of si and ceramic density artifacts of mass ca .",
    "1 kg in the form of spheres through comparative weighing . due to the limited space on its weighing pan as well as the weighing procedure itself it was deemed necessary to also use its under - floor weighing facility in order to perform the measurements",
    ". thus the object of which the mass is to be determined is placed in a ring cradle and hung from the balance weighing cell via a ca .",
    "80 cm steel wire which passes through a hole at the bottom of the balance . in order to have stable weighing conditions ,",
    "a plexi - glass draft shield of approximately 0,3 @xmath20 volume was used with a facility for installing temperature and relative humidity sensors .",
    "a simple weight exchange mechanism was used to alternately weigh the weight standard placed on the balance pan and the test object hanging from the balance in an attempt to minimize the disturbance of the weighing environment [ 13 ] . since weighing of non - conducting objects is prone to electrostatic charging effects it was ensured that the relative humidity within the draft shield was above 40% .",
    "the air temperature was set at 22,5 @xmath21 .",
    "the data presented below resulted from a si sphere of mass approximately 1 kg hanging from the balance weighing cell .",
    "sampling was performed every 20 sec of the balance indication and of the environmental conditions .",
    "the following figures show the raw data transformed into a time series of equal time intervals ( figure 1 ) , the variation of temperature ( figure 2 ) and relative humidity ( figure 3 ) over time .    for a time interval approximately equal to three hours",
    ", the time series evolves in accordance with ambient temperature , a consequence of the increase of air density and thus of buoyancy due to air .",
    "afterwards , it shows an increasing trend most probably due to balance drift . in order to eliminate these deterministic affects ,",
    "a first difference filter is applied and the resulting series is thoroughly examined for stochastic correlations and noise .",
    "time series of hanging si sphere .",
    "ambient conditions , temperature .",
    "ambient conditions , relative humidity .",
    "the lag plot of the differenced series in figure 4 is comprised of a small number of points , due to the limited discritization available , gathered around ( 0,0 ) with no particular structure that could reveal any serial correlations .",
    "lag plot of the differenced time series , showing no structure .",
    "@xmath22    the correlogram in figure 5 shows positive serial correlations in the first lags and the sample acf approaches zero very slowly ( after 2000 sec ) , suggesting the inadequacy of the white noise model and the use of classical variance . from approximately the 200th lag and after , the data become independent falling well within the 95% confidence bands of @xmath23 , implying that the white noise model is now sufficient to describe the measurements .",
    "consequently , two different noise areas are also expected in the psd diagram .",
    "the shape of the acf is exponentially decaying to zero so an ar model would be appropriate to model the data [ 5 ] .",
    "the sample autocorrelation function of the first - differenced data , showing the long - term correlations of the first lags .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the 95% confidence levels for the white noise model .",
    "@xmath22    the periodogram of the differenced data as well as the psd ( in log - log ) of the original and the differenced series are presented in figures 6 and 7 . in figure 6 , the presence of strong power intensity in lower frequencies indicates an ar model with f>0 to model the data .",
    "figure 7 shows a comparison between the original time series before the removal of deterministic affects and the differenced series .",
    "as expected , a random - walk noise model adequately describes the non - stationary series and the slope of the regression line ( red line ) is close to 2 . on the contrary ,",
    "the differenced series exhibits a more complex behavior . at lower frequencies , a line of slope close to 0.6 ( blue line )",
    "can approximate the data but at higher frequencies the white noise model of zero slope seems to be more appropriate ( green line ) .",
    "thus , there exists a cut - off frequency at which a marked change of slope occurs , revealing the two different noise areas of flicker or pink noise and white noise [ 5 ] .",
    "this implies that after about 500 sec the classical variance would be valid as a measure of dispersion of the data .",
    "in addition , a suitable power law model would be @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the intensity coefficients .",
    "table i summarizes the results for the two time series .",
    "the periodogram of the first - differenced data , showing high intensity at low frequencies and white noise at the rest of the spectrum .",

    ", the random walk noise turns into a combination of flicker and white noise .",
    "the fitted line is of the form y = n*x + logh , where y = log(power ) and x = log(frequency ) .",
    "@xmath22    table i.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the main purpose of this work is to point out the importance of considering measurement results as time series and of using the time series analysis methods to test for correlations . only in the absence of correlation the use of the expression",
    "@xmath27 is appropriate to characterize the random uncertainty .",
    "otherwise , the allan variance is an alternate , more appropriate tool to characterize the dispersion of a set of experimental results .",
    "lag plots , correlograms and periodograms are graphic tools of eda analysis used to identify serial correlations in measurements and estimate the type of the underlying stochastic noise . for the case study of mass measurements we consider here ,",
    "all the above techniques give consistent results .",
    "allan variance and psd analysis provide almost the same information for a set of measurements but with the strict limitation of data collected at regular time intervals .",
    "also , the length of the time series must be of a value of 2@xmath28 otherwise not all points are included in the fourier transform and allan variance calculations .",
    "future work will mainly focus on the application of tsa methods to other measurement circumstances , the comparison of the psd with bayesian spectrum analysis methods , the possible use of a second difference filter and the phase noise analysis ."
