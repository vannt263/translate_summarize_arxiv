    "the present work focuses on the study of the x - ray activity of orion nebula cluster ( onc ) members : from a purely observational standpoint , we explore the relationship between x - ray activity and stellar characteristics , searching for the physical mechanisms responsible for coronal x - ray activity in pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars . in spite of the previous observational work in this area ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no definitive picture has yet emerged .",
    "our investigation is based on the original _ chandra _ high resolution camera ( hrc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) x - ray data and literature optical data presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) and @xcite for objects in the onc area . for the onc region under study ,",
    "paper  i defined an _ optical sample _ of 696 optically selected , extinction limited , and well characterized onc members . here",
    "we address the controversial questions of the relationship of x - ray activity with convection and rotation ( i.e. , the classical @xmath9 dynamo parameters ) , with stellar mass and age , and with circumstellar accretion and/or the presence of circumstellar disks .",
    "taking advantage of our detailed description of activity as a function of stellar mass , we then explore the nature of the few detected x - ray sources not associated with any optical / infrared ( ir ) counterparts .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in  [ sect : xvsopt ] we study the relation of activity with rotation , mass , age and circumstellar accretion strength . in  [ sect : unid ] we speculate on the nature of x - ray sources with no optical / ir counterpart .",
    "finally we discuss our findings and summarize our conclusions in  [ sect : disc ] .",
    "an appendix details our technique for investigating possible sources below our x - ray sensitivity limit .",
    "in exploring relationships between x - ray activity and stellar characteristics through empirical correlations with physically meaningful stellar parameters , our main goal is to understand the @xmath105 orders of magnitude spread that we observe in @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "we focus on how activity is related to stellar rotational period , to mass and evolutionary status ( as inferred from evolutionary tracks - see paper  i ) , and to the presence of an accretion disk .",
    "paper  i presents relevant x - ray and optical data for our _ optical sample _ comprised of 696 onc likely members , 342 of which are unambiguously detected in our hrc x - ray data and have both low optical extinction ( @xmath11 ) and available mass estimates .",
    "this stellar sample was carefully selected in order to avoid x - ray selection effects .",
    "our non - parametric approach is to split our reference sample into several bins of the stellar parameter under examination , to evaluate for each of these bins a maximum likelihood distribution function ( using the _ kaplan - mayer _ estimator ) for our two x - ray activity indicators , and then to examine the trends of these distributions as a function of the parameter .",
    "the kaplan - mayer estimators were computed using the asurv package @xcite , which was also used to perform various two population tests on pairs of selected stellar subsamples in order to establish the confidence with which we can reject the null hypothesis ( that two distributions of a given parameter are drawn from the same parent distribution ) .",
    "we first searched for a correlation between x - ray activity and stellar rotational period ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "such a correlation is known to hold for older , main sequence stars of low mass and moderate rotation rate and is the main evidence for activity being driven by an @xmath13 stellar dynamo .",
    "such correlations have not previously been found for the onc stars @xcite and several other pms associations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the young taurus region , to the contrary , a correlation between activity and rotation has been observed @xcite .",
    "given the incompleteness of rotational databases used in most previous studies , the question remains open .    in figure",
    "[ fig : p_dist ] we show the distribution of rotational periods ( upper panel ) collected in paper  i from the recent literature for 282 stars in our _ optical sample_. also shown vs. @xmath12 is the hrc detection fraction ( lower panel ) .",
    "our database of rotational periods is significantly more complete than that available to @xcite , but in spite of this improvement and _ chandra s _ higher x - ray sensitivity ( which yields a high detection fraction ) , we still can find no evidence of correlation between x - ray luminosity and @xmath12 .",
    "the scatter plot of @xmath14 vs. @xmath15 ( figure [ fig : lxlbvsprot ] ) similarly shows no evidence of a correlation with @xmath12 .",
    "these results hold true no matter what physically meaningful subsample of the whole we consider .",
    "indeed , in order to minimize stellar structure differences throughout the sample that might wash out a correlation with @xmath12 , we repeated the analysis in several mass bins ( see  [ sect : lxvsmass ] ) and also for high and low accretion stars ( see  [ sect : caii ] ) , obtaining the same negative results in all cases .",
    "it should be noted that the sample of stars for which rotational periods are available is strongly biased toward the most x - ray active stars .",
    "for example , the median @xmath14 for stars with known rotational period and mass smaller than 3.0@xmath16 is -3.37 while the corresponding median for stars of the same mass with unknown rotational periods is -3.73 .",
    "moreover , the subsample of stars with known @xmath12 appears to be dominated by the most weakly accreting stars in the whole sample ( see  [ sect : caii ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : lxvsma ] shows maximum likelihood x - ray luminosity functions ( xlfs ) for onc members in eight mass bins , while figure [ fig : lxvsmb ] shows a scatter plot of @xmath8 vs. mass with characterizations of the xlfs superposed for the same mass bins ( see caption ) . in figure [ fig : lxvsmb ] a direct correlation between median @xmath8 and mass can clearly be seen for @xmath17 , while in the mass range from 3 to 10 @xmath16 ( where 6 of 12 stars have luminosities below detection threshold ) the median @xmath8 drops significantly and only an upper limit can be estimated . for massive o - type stars with @xmath18",
    ", @xmath8 rises again .",
    "scenarios in which a dynamo drives x - ray activity would interpret this break at @xmath103  @xmath16 as the point at which stars of the onc s age ( @xmath19 ) become fully radiative and the dynamo stops functioning .",
    "this interpretation is indeed supported by the stellar structure evolutionary tracks of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdf ) .",
    "the drop in @xmath8 at @xmath103  @xmath16 is even more pronounced than shown in figures [ fig : lxvsma ] and [ fig : lxvsmb ] if we take stellar multiplicity into account .",
    "the fact that most secondaries will have significantly lower masses than their primaries , together with the mass  ",
    "@xmath8 relation , means that multiplicity effects on the xlfs can generally be expected to be rather small .",
    "but if primaries in the @xmath20 bin have very little intrinsic x - ray emission , we will detect only secondary emission .",
    "indeed , we observe that the xlf for @xmath20 mass stars crosses those for stars of lower mass and is determined for about half the bin population .",
    "this lends indirect support to the hypothesis that emission for @xmath20 mass stars is mainly due to _ unresolved _ secondaries .",
    "figure [ fig : lxlbvsma ] shows distribution functions for @xmath4 , in the same mass bins as defined for figure [ fig : lxvsma ] , while figure [ fig : lxlbvsmb ] follows the format of figure [ fig : lxvsmb ] to show @xmath4 vs. mass ( logarithmically ) .",
    "the drop in activity at @xmath21 is even more striking with @xmath4 as an indicator : more than 2 orders of magnitude ( note that the median value in the @xmath22 range is an upper limit ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the upper envelope of @xmath23 for stars with @xmath24 is compatible ( within uncertainties ) with the level of @xmath25 , i.e. the _ saturation level _ found for both rapidly - rotating main sequence stars @xcite and low mass stars in several other star formation regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is also apparent from figure [ fig : lxlbvsma ] .",
    "no satisfactory theoretical explanation for the physical nature of this saturation has been found to date .",
    "our analysis quantifies typical @xmath4 values in terms of the median and the scatter of points and finds somewhat lower values than the canonical -3 value , indicating either a different saturation level or perhaps the presence of a mix of saturated and non - saturated stars .",
    "there also seems to be a relationship between median level and stellar mass , with the lowest mass stars ( e.g. , those in the 0.10 - 0.16@xmath16 bin ) having a significantly lower median value of @xmath4 than those of higher mass stars .",
    "the range of the variation between the 0.10 - 0.16@xmath26 and the 0.5 - 1.0@xmath26 bins is 0.45 dex , larger than our estimated uncertainty in _ individual _ @xmath4 values ( cf .",
    "paper  i ) .",
    "a viable theoretical explanation of activity in the pms phase will have to account for this mass dependence of either the fraction of saturated vs. unsaturated stars or of the saturation phenomenon itself .",
    "to conclude our study of x - ray activity vs. stellar mass , we now wish to address the x - ray properties of the significant fraction of undetected very low mass stars .",
    "more specifically we wonder whether non detected stars are simply located at the bottom of the @xmath8 distributions shown in figure [ fig : lxvsma ] or whether they constitute distinct stellar populations with significantly lower x - ray luminosities .",
    "appendix [ app : nodet ] describes how we used our _ chandra _ hrc data to derive ( or constrain ) mean x - ray luminosities for mass segregated groups of objects , some or all of which are individually undetected .",
    "the method measures the flux of a `` composite '' source by summing hrc photons detected at the optical positions of individually undetected objects comprising the `` composite . ''",
    "figure [ fig : bd ] shows the logarithm of average @xmath8 , both for the whole reference sample and for undetected objects in several mass bins .",
    "the height of the boxes reflect the uncertainty in the count - rate to flux conversion factors for the `` composite '' source ( see appendix [ app : nodet ] ) .",
    "the number of summed objects in each mass bin is reported in the upper part of the figure , and for reference , the median @xmath8 from figure [ fig : lxvsmb ] is also shown .",
    "as a `` sanity check '' we compared the average @xmath8 computed with the method described in appendix [ app : nodet ] for the whole reference sample of detected and undetected objects with the average @xmath8 computed from the maximum likelihood luminosity functions ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "we find the two results consistent , lending support to this analysis .",
    "note that the discrepancy of mean and median @xmath8 in figure [ fig : bd ] is indeed due to a real difference between the two indices and indicates an asymmetry in the @xmath8 distributions .    from figure",
    "[ fig : bd ] we therefore draw the conclusion that undetected stars in the stellar samples ( @xmath27 ) have an average @xmath8 well below our sensitivity limit ( note that the 0.1 - 0.16@xmath16 bin has _ only _ an upper limit ) .",
    "this could either mean that the xlfs have very long low - luminosity tails or indicate the existence of a stellar population with quiescent / suppressed magnetic activity .",
    "the same qualitative results found in this section are also obtained if the evolutionary tracks of @xcite are substituted for those of sdf in estimating masses . similarly , if we exclude the few _ optical sample _ stars with unknown astrometric membership ( cf .",
    "paper i ) from our analysis , the results also remain unchanged .      our _ optical sample _",
    "contains 15 substellar mass objects ( @xmath28 ) all of which were studied through ir spectroscopy by @xcite .",
    "only one of the brown dwarfs ( bd ) , with an estimated mass of @xmath29 , is detected in our hrc data . ] .",
    "our xlf analysis therefore can not be extended to such low masses .",
    "this poses the question of why so few brown dwarfs are detected : are bds subluminous in x rays with respect to our mass    @xmath8 relation , or do they fall on this relation but below our limiting sensitivity level , as a linear extrapolation of the mass  ",
    "@xmath8 relationship in figure [ fig : lxvsmb ] indeed suggests .    in order to investigate this question",
    ", we once again applied the method of appendix [ app : nodet ] : the two substellar mass bins in figure [ fig : bd ] show our results .",
    "the lowest mass bin contains just 3 undetected objects and yields only an upper limit .",
    "nine objects lie in the _ brown dwarf _ bin ( @xmath30 ) . ] and our method yields a positive detection of the `` composite '' source with high confidence40.1 photons in a total effective exposure time of 553  ksec is measured . as discussed above ,",
    "one of these 9 objects is detected individually , with 16.2 extracted counts .",
    "if we exclude this object of uncertain bd status , the resulting `` composite '' source falls slightly below our detection threshold ( @xmath31 ) , with its probability of being due to background fluctuations at @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : bd ] indicates it as an upper limit corresponding to less than 25.1 photons accumulated over an effective exposure time of 491  ksec .",
    "had we instead accepted it as a positive detection , an accumulated photon count of 23.9 would imply an x - ray luminosity virtually identical to the upper limit value . ] .",
    "figure [ fig : bd ] indicates that : 1 ) brown dwarfs in the onc do _ not _ depart from the @xmath8 - mass relationship we observe for higher mass stars , and 2 ) the mean bd x - ray luminosity is of the order of @xmath34 erg@xmath35s@xmath36 . on average this is higher than the recent results obtained for bds in ic  348 by @xcite , but lower than the @xmath8 reported by @xcite for one detected bd and one bd candidate in the young @xmath37 ophiuchi cloud .",
    "although the relationship with mass explains a good deal of the scatter in activity levels of our sample , the deviations from this trend are still significant .",
    "the next stellar parameter we investigate in order to understand this residual scatter is the age , as inferred from the sdf evolutionary tracks .",
    "figure [ fig : lxvsa0a ] shows the @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 plot for stars in our sample with mass between 0.5 and 1.0 @xmath16 .",
    "the median @xmath8 appears to decrease with increasing age , but we must exercise special care in the interpretation of this trend : there is a widespread concern that the age spread indicated by the position of low mass stars still on the hayashi tracks may be largely , or even entirely , due to an artificial spread in the bolometric luminosities ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the sources of error that may contribute to uncertainties in @xmath40 and consequent age are indeed numerous and include uncertainties in : adopted distance , spectral type and extinction , photometric variability , unresolved companions , and accretion luminosity . on the other hand , if one were to concede a real age spread in the onc ( plausible as star formation is still taking place at the present day ) , stellar ages might carry a statistical and relative significance , though still uncertain on an individual basis : stars that we place lower on the hayashi tracks may be older , on average , than those that we place higher .",
    "this latter hypothesis is supported by the time evolution of onc stellar radii recently observed by @xcite .",
    "although our correlation of @xmath8 with age also seems to argue in favor of a real age spread , it could also be an artifact of an interrelation between inferred @xmath8 and @xmath40 , and the matter remains open .",
    "indeed the trend in figure [ fig : lxvsa0a ] corresponds to a constant ratio of x - ray to bolometric luminosity at different ages and can be interpreted equally well in two different ways : 1 ) stars of equal mass have equal bolometric and x - ray luminosities , but there are effects that act in exactly the same way on both @xmath8 and @xmath40 ; 2 ) these stars are saturated and stay saturated through their contraction on the hayashi tracks , thus keeping @xmath4 constant .",
    "figure [ fig : lxvsa0b ] presents a plot of @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 for stars in the @xmath41 mass bin and reveals an age dependence and a sudden drop of @xmath8 at @xmath42 ( a similar drop is also seen in @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is just the age at which a @xmath43 star dissipates its convective envelope according to the sdf models , lending further evidence for the convection  ",
    "activity connection found in  [ sect : lxvsmass ] .",
    "figure [ fig : lxvsa0b ] also supports the existence of a real age spread in the onc .",
    "contrary to the situation in the @xmath44 mass range , evolution of these higher mass stars occurs in temperature as well as in luminosity for @xmath45 .",
    "the spread in age therefore can not be due to a spurious spread in @xmath40 , as may be the case in the lower mass bin .",

    "this suggests that the `` non - ids '' as a group are high - intrinsic x - ray luminosity objects , which are either highly embedded in the cloud or which lie in the background .",
    "this conclusion is supported by our analysis of the hydrogen column density , @xmath70 , measured directly from x - ray data ( cf .",
    "appendix a of paper  i )",
    ". since the `` non - ids '' are largely low - snr detections@xmath71 , however , the hardness ratios derived from advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis , @xcite ) spectra are subject to large uncertainties .",

    "with these assumptions , the surface density of extragalactic sources seen through a given hydrogen column density becomes @xmath86 $ ] and we can compute the expected number of extragalactic sources detected in an area @xmath87 as :    @xmath88 \\cdot d a \\label{eq : agn}\\ ] ]    where @xmath89 is the infinitesimal area element and @xmath70 is a function of position on the sky .",
    "computing the integral ( [ eq : agn ] ) for the given values of @xmath79 , @xmath85 and energy band ( and therefore @xmath80 $ ] ) , we find expected numbers of detectable extragalactic objects in the inner @xmath64 of our fov ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 .",
    "an extragalactic nature for most of our unidentified sources is therefore excluded , and most `` non - ids '' can indeed be highly embedded onc members never observed with optical or near - ir instruments .",
    "we can get a rough estimate for the size of this hidden population if we assume that counterparts of the @xmath1020 unidentified field - center sources ( expected to be real ) have masses larger than @xmath78 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : noid ] ) and that the ratio of the number of stars with @xmath90 to stars with @xmath91 is the same as for our _ optical sample _ , namely , @xmath1025% for the field center and @xmath1016% for the entire fov .",
    "we obtain the interesting result that the undiscovered population numbers between 80 and 125 stars , i.e. , about half of the optically - well characterized members140 are in our _ optical sample_. ] in the same region and about a quarter of the optical objects studied by @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "there are @xmath92 stars seen in the infrared with @xmath93 , implying masses that roughly correspond to the mass range spanned by our _ optical sample_. we conclude , therefore , that the central region of the onc contains @xmath10100 additional stars that remain hidden from the deepest @xmath65-band surveys conducted to date .",
    "using _ chandra _ x - ray data and recent optical / ir data from the literature , both presented in paper  i , we have studied relationships among x - ray activity indices and various stellar parameters for an optically - selected sample of onc members .",
    "our ultimate goal is to explain on physical grounds the mechanisms responsible for x - ray emission and magnetic activity in pms stars .",
    "we do not find any correlation of either @xmath8 or @xmath4 with stellar rotational period .",
    "this result has sometimes been regarded as evidence against the @xmath94 - @xmath95 dynamo explanation of activity for pms stars .",
    "we note however that : 1 ) although the sample of stars for which we have a measure of rotational period is larger than ever considered in similar past studies , it is still biased toward more active stars , as judged from distributions of x - ray activity indicators ; 2 ) many of the sources with known rotational properties may thus have saturated activity levels and the intensity of their x - ray emission may therefore be insensitive to the rotational period ; 3 ) 90% of these rotational periods are shorter than 10 days ; 4 ) as discussed by @xcite , periods up to @xmath96 days might correspond to saturated activity for @xmath101  myr - old stars , according to the _ consolidated _ activity  ",
    "rossby  number relation .",
    "we therefore do not regard the present lack of evidence of a rotation - activity relationship as conclusive for the onc and look forward the realization of more complete rotational period databases .",
    "we also note that even if the measured rotational periods were representative of the whole onc population ( as recently indicated by @xcite ) , a lack of correlation does not necessarily require a new explanation of activity .    as previously noted for other star forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find a significant correlation of @xmath8 with mass for @xmath97 .",
    "the logarithm of the median @xmath8 rises quite linearly on a logarithmic mass scale from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , but for higher masses , drops sharply before rising again above @xmath100 .",
    "the drop in activity at @xmath101 is even more dramatic in @xmath4 ( more than two orders of magnitude ) and may be further enhanced if proper account for multiplicity were taken .",
    "supported by recent pms evolutionary models ( sdf ) we interpret this drop as the effect of the disappearance of a convective envelope for stars more massive than @xmath102 . in general we note a convincing correlation between the presence of a convective layer and activity for @xmath103 .    for @xmath104 , the median @xmath14",
    "is observed to be quite stable at about -3.5 , lower than ( though close to ) the saturation level . at lower masses",
    "however we observe a decrease of the median @xmath4 with decreasing mass , as it falls by a factor of @xmath105 ( @xmath106 dex ) between @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we are unsure of the origin of this mass dependence but note a rough coincidence between the turning point in the @xmath4 - mass relation , at @xmath78 , and the mass at which 1  myr stars cease to be fully convective ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : lxlbvsm4 ] ) .",
    "we suggest this may be due to a transition from an @xmath94@xmath95 dynamo to a fully - convective dynamo",
    ". it may be even more relevant to note that the median value of the ca  ii line equivalent width , which can be used as a proxy of disk accretion ( cf .  [ sect : caii ] ) , is significantly lower for stars with masses below 0.5@xmath26 ( median @xmath48=-0.15 ) than for stars with mass between 0.5 and 3.0@xmath26 ( median @xmath48=0.94 ) , possibly indicating a larger fraction of accreting stars at low masses .",
    "we therefore propose ( cf . @xcite ) that the increase of @xmath4 at low masses _ might _ be the effect of a decrease , with increasing stellar mass , of the fraction of stars that are accreting and/or are surrounded by disks .",
    "we indeed found such stars to have significantly lower activity levels (  [ sect : caii ] ) .",
    "although we do not detect any securely identified brown dwarfs , we are able to estimate the mean x - ray luminosity for the 9 spectroscopically confirmed bds of the bd bin in figure [ fig : bd ] .",
    "the mean @xmath8 of @xmath109  erg@xmath35s@xmath36 appears to be on the same @xmath8 vs. mass relationship we observe for higher mass stars .",
    "this is not particularly surprising because at this evolutionary stage bds do not fundamentally differ from low mass fully convective pms stars .",
    "we have evidence of the presence of a population of very weak emitters at the low mass end . in the @xmath110 mass bin , for example",
    ", we observe that the mean x - ray luminosity of stars individually not detected in the x - ray data ( paper  i ) is @xmath111 orders of magnitude lower with respect to the mean of the whole sample , indicating either a very wide or a bimodal x - ray luminosity distribution .",
    "at least part of this dispersion can be explained by a dependence of activity on circumstellar accretion rate . by discriminating stars with high and low circumstellar accretion on the basis of the ca  ii ( @xmath112 ) equivalent width",
    ", we prove with high statistical significance that the x - ray activity of the two groups differs by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "the relationships of median @xmath8 and @xmath4 with mass appear to hold exclusively for the low accretion sample .",
    "we also note that the scatter in activity at a given mass appears to be larger for the high accretion sample than for the low accretion sample .",
    "although the origin of these differences is presently unknown , we put forward three possible scenarios :    \\1 ) accreting stars are rotating slowly due to disk breaking and their dynamo efficiency depends on rotation , while those accreting less have broken free of their disks to spin - up and thus saturate their activity .",
    "this hypothesis seems to be contradicted by two facts : low and high accretion stars have statistically indistinguishable rotational periods ( cf . figure [ fig : p_dist ] ) and , as reported in ",
    "[ sect : prot ] , we do not observe a correlation between activity and @xmath12 .",
    "however , the sample of stars for which we have rotational information is not complete and may be subject to biases ( see  [ sect : prot ] ) , so that we can not rule out this possibility until a more representative sample of rotational periods becomes available .",
    "\\2 ) accretion and/or the presence of a disk , and/or outflows influences coronal geometry , for example , by decreasing the fraction of the stellar surface available for the closed magnetic structures from which x - ray emission is thought to emanate .",
    "other scenarios of altered geometries have been proposed ; e.g. , @xcite argue that coronal structures might extend to the inner part of disk . because of the inhomogeneous and time variable nature of accretion , variability studies and simultaneous x - ray / optical observations could help clarify this matter .",
    "\\3 ) accreting stars have higher x - ray extinction than assumed , so that the difference in inferred @xmath8 and @xmath4 is only apparent .",
    "although in paper  i our acis spectra analysis was not able to exclude this possibility with high confidence , due mainly to the low photon statistics of sources associated with high accretion stars , we also found no supporting evidence for this scenario .",
    "moreover , an empirical determination of the @xmath70 vs. @xmath113 relation for the @xmath37 ophiuchi population ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) also does not support this hypothesis .",
    "the reason for the departure from the assumed @xmath113-@xmath70 relation could be that the gas to dust ratio may differ for accreting stars with respect to the average interstellar value , resulting in an underestimation of the x - ray absorption .",
    "one could imagine a scenario in which accretion gas columns that cross the line of sight would obscure x - rays and let optical / ir radiation through .",
    "the most obvious test for this hypothesis is a better determination of hydrogen absorbing columns through deeper ( i.e. , longer exposures ) medium spectral resolution x - ray observations . as for the previous hypothesis",
    ", variability studies might also give useful clues .",
    "finally we have investigated the nature of sources detected in our hrc x - ray data and not identified with any optical / ir object . on the basis of their x - ray spectra and location in the cloud",
    "we conclude that , as a class , they are subject to high extinction . we exclude an extragalactic nature for most of these objects by considering the sky density of such objects as a function of x - ray flux and of the molecular cloud total extinction and conclude that most unidentified x - ray sources are likely associated with deeply embedded , high intrinsic x - ray luminosity , onc members .",
    "given the relationship between @xmath8 and stellar mass we infer that these stars are most likely fairly massive ( @xmath114 ) , thus indicating the likely presence of a significant number of lower mass , as yet undetected onc members .    in light of these results , we propose this scenario :    \\1 ) activity in @xmath115 old low mass pms stars is ultimately due to a dynamo mechanism that requires a convective layer in order to function .",
    "rotation may or may not be a fundamental ingredient of this dynamo .",
    "\\2 ) the same mechanism responsible for x - ray emission of low mass stars is probably also at work in brown dwarfs .",
    "\\3 ) many of our stars appear to be saturated .",
    "the fraction of saturated stars , or alternatively the saturation level , depends on stellar mass . at low masses we might be seeing the effect of decreasing accretion / disk fraction with increasing mass , or the transition between two kinds of dynamos : one that functions on fully convective stars and brown dwarfs and in which the saturation level depends on mass , and another at work on partially convective - partially radiative stars , characterized by a constant saturation level .",
    "\\4 ) highly accreting stars are seen to be less active with respect to low accretion counterparts , possibly because of ( a ) different rotational properties , ( b ) disk / accretion induced modifications of the coronal magnetic field geometry , or ( c ) anomalous interstellar x - ray absorption due to the presence of circumstellar material .    additional deep x - ray and ir observations are needed to advance our understanding and enable us to identify which scenario(s ) nature prefers .",
    "the authors would like to thank l. hartman for useful discussion .",
    "this work was partially supported at the cfa by nasa contracts nas8 - 38248 and nas8 - 39073 and by nasa grant nas5 - 4967 .",
    ", g.m . , and s.s .",
    "wish to acknowledge support from the italian space agency ( asi ) and murst .",
    "e.f . would like to thank the cfa for its hospitality during his fellow visits .",
    "here we describe a `` composite '' source method we employed to study the mean x - ray properties of groups of onc members , some or all of which were individually undetected in our hrc data .",
    "the method was applied in  [ sect : lxvsmass ] to undetected low mass stars , and in  [ sect : bd ] , to objects of substellar mass .",
    "the basic steps of our method are to : 1 ) define a suitable sample of stellar or substellar objects ; 2 ) determine the number of photons detected in a circular region at the x - ray position corresponding to each _ optical _ object ; 3 ) correct the photon numbers for background contributions and the fact that a ( predictable ) fraction of the photons from a point - like source will fall outside the extraction circle ; 4 ) sum the contributions of single objects and derive a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the `` composite '' source ; 5 ) divide the `` composite '' source net counts ( or upper limit , for snrs below a set threshold ) by the cumulative exposure time to obtain a mean count rate for objects in the sample ; and finally , 6 ) convert the mean count rate ( or upper limit ) to a `` composite '' @xmath8 value .",
    "the selection of composite source samples was based on stellar ( or substellar ) mass as given by our _ optical sample_. we also added three more requirements : a ) that the objects lay in the inner 5@xmath116 of the hrc field of view , b ) that the closest detected x - ray source ( other than the object in question , if detected ) was farther away than 5@xmath117 and c ) that the measured optical extinction @xmath113 was less than 2.0 .",
    "constraint ( a ) ensures that the psf at the position of all the objects in the sample contains more than @xmath118 of the photons falling within a circle of @xmath119 radius , while ( b ) isolates the source to avoid contamination with photons from neighboring sources . constraint ( c ) reduces the uncertainty in the conversion between composite source count rates and x - ray luminosities .",
    "individual source photons were extracted from a 2@xmath117 circle centered on the optical star position .",
    "figure [ fig : bd_im ] shows an example of the extraction regions for undetected members in the @xmath120 mass range as well as a graphical representation of the composite source resulting from the summation process .",
    "the background contribution in each of the extraction circles was estimated from the values of the source - free background map produced by pwdetect ( cf .",
    "paper  i ) .",
    "the fraction of counts from the object falling within this extraction circle ranges from @xmath10 60% to 95% and was estimated from the images of calibrated psfs obtained for the position of each source using the ciao task mkpsf and the f1 standard psf library file @xcite .",
    "sources were assumed for this purpose to be monochromatic with an energy of 2.0 kev .",
    "a visual comparison of the expected and observed shape of the psf for bright sources in our present sample indicates a good qualitative match .      from counting statistics we estimated the probability that the measured total number of extracted counts is the result of random fluctuation in the background level . in those cases in which such probability was larger than 0.135% ( @xmath31 ) ,",
    "we computed upper limits to the composite source counts using the same confidence threshold .      the cumulative exposure time used to compute mean count rates for the objects in each mass segregated sample was obtained by summing the values of the exposure map ( cf .",
    "paper  i ) at the position of the objects .",
    "we converted mean count rates to x - ray luminosities in a manner consistent with paper  i , but such conversion depends critically on extinction . while we can derive conversion factors for each of the component objects , a global conversion factor for a composite source can not be readily defined .",
    "if all the objects in the sample had the same intrinsic x - ray luminosity the conversion factor for the average source would be the average of the single conversion factors . in order to reduce the range of individual conversion factors",
    "we have limited our object sample to low optical extinction ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "however some uncertainty remains : as shown in figure 8 of paper  i , this range of @xmath113 corresponds to a factor of about 3 ( @xmath122 dex ) variation in the conversion factor at our chosen source temperature ( 2.16  kev ) .",
    "we therefore report two values of luminosity for each of our average sources : one computed with the mean of the conversion factors , the other with the median .",
