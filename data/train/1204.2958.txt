    "strain engineering is a modern strategy to control and enhance materials properties .",
    "it represents a technique which deals with semiconductor and ferroic thin films strained on a substrate .",
    "such strain can be tensile or compressive and occurs due to a difference between lattice parameters of the film and that of the underlying substrate . in strain - engineered ferroics , the strain appearing in the film shifts the transition temperatures and can change the properties of the material such as the dielectric and piezoelectric constants , remanent polarization , or even can induce room temperature ferroelectricity in a non - ferroelectric material @xcite .",
    "currently used methods for the description of thermodynamics of ferroic thin films ( classical landau theory @xcite , phase field modeling @xcite , and _ ab initio _ based monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite ) are based on an energy expansion in terms of internal degrees of freedom .",
    "any treatment of this kind starts from such expansion for the bulk ferroic ( e.g. the effective hamiltonian for mc simulations @xcite or a thermodynamic potential for landau theory analysis @xcite ) .",
    "further mixed mechanical conditions corresponding to the films are applied .",
    "this way one establishes a kind of effective thermodynamic potential ( or effective hamiltonian ) of the film .",
    "minimisation of such potential or further mc simulations yield the ferroic state of a film as a function of the temperature and misfit strain .",
    "the standard way to present the results of such calculations is the so - called `` temperature - misfit strain '' phase diagrams @xcite , which give the ferroic state depending on temperature and strain appearing in the film .",
    "such diagrams have been developed for many classical ferroelectric materials like @xmath0@xcite , @xmath1@xcite , and @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to draw attention to the fact that the aforementioned methods of description of ferroelectric thin films in their current implementations may suffer from a serious _ principle _ drawback , which may lead to erroneous results .",
    "it is commonly understood that a large ( sometimes enormous ) difference between the properties of a strained film and its bulk counterpart is due to the coupling between the order parameter and strain .",
    "customarily this coupling is modeled in the so - called electrostriction approximation corresponding to terms quadratic in the order parameter and linear in mechanical strain ( stress ) in the thermodynamic potential @xcite or effective hamiltonian @xcite of the bulk material .",
    "already 10 years ago , when using the electrostriction approximation for a special situation in @xmath1 films of ( 111)-orientation , a possible _ principle _ deficiency of this approximation was pointed out .",
    "this paper is devoted to a comprehensive analysis of this problem in terms of landau theory however the conclusion should hold for mc simulations as well .",
    "we show that this `` electrostriction based '' description provides an adequate thermodynamics approach of ferroelectric thin films only if it is controlled by the free energy expansion up to fourth power terms in polarization .",
    "however , if the sixth - power polarization terms ( @xmath3-terms ) are needed , which is a common situation for ferroelectric perovskites , higher - order electromechanical couplings should be taken into account .",
    "we elucidate the matter in terms of a simplified phenomenological model . to demonstrate the phenomenon for thin films , we estimate some higher - order electrostrictive coefficients using experimental data and we calculate missing coefficients ( in order to have a complete set ) using _ ab initio _ methods . then",
    ", we show that the higher - order electromechanical couplings readily lead to an order - of - magnitude renormalization of the @xmath3-terms of free energy when passing from the bulk thermodynamic potential to the effective thermodynamic potential of the film .",
    "finally , we illustrate our message with the results of the calculations for a @xmath0 thin film .",
    "the problem with the `` electrostriction based '' description of strained ferroelectrics can be illustrated qualitatively by a simple scalar model .",
    "let us describe a ferroelectric with a gibbs thermodynamic potential energy expansion keeping only one component of polarization @xmath4 and stress @xmath5 :    @xmath6    where the `` ordinary '' part represents gibbs energy commonly used to describe ferroelectric systems ( @xmath7 - `` ordinary '' electrostrictive coefficient , @xmath8 - linear compliance ) and `` high - order '' terms ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 - high - order electrostrictive coefficients and @xmath11 - non - linear compliance ) which are customarily neglected .",
    "this neglect can be readily justified for a bulk material but the situation for a clamped system is different .",
    "we can show this considering ferroelectricity in a clamped system , i.e. where the strain @xmath12 equals the misfit strain @xmath13 . to obtain an effective potential of the clamped system @xmath14 where @xmath15 is temperature , we eliminate stress @xmath5 using a mechanical equation of state @xmath16 and write the effective thermodynamic potential @xmath17 : @xmath18 where minima of @xmath19 with respect to polarization correspond to the ground state of the clamped system .",
    "electromechanical interactions in such systems lead to renormalizations of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath3 : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 now , let us have a closer look at eqs . - .",
    "the @xmath25 term in leads to the shift of the phase transition temperature .",
    "the @xmath26 term in renormalizes @xmath21 , for example , for @xmath0 this `` renormalization '' switches the sign of @xmath21 , i.e. it changes the order of the phase transition passing from a bulk material to a film @xcite .",
    "these two `` electrostrictive '' corrections do not involve high - order electrostrictive couplings , they are well known and justified experimentally @xcite . at the same time , atomic order - of - magnitude estimates show that , in , @xmath27 is about @xmath28 whereas @xmath26 is about @xmath29 in . thus , in view of smallness of @xmath13 for any practical situation the @xmath30 and @xmath31 corrections are expected to be negligible , except the cases where the low - order corrections are unusually small .",
    "however , atomic order - of - magnitude estimates suggest that the @xmath32 correction in is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath3 similar to the strong renormalization of the @xmath21 term in . these estimates imply that the high - order coefficients , which are customarily neglected in the majority of problems , should be included into thermodynamic energy expansions as far as the `` @xmath3-term '' in is important for the description of a problem .",
    "there are several ways to introduce high - order couplings to landau theory .",
    "the first one is to use the gibbs thermodynamic energy expansion for a centrosymmetric cubic crystal with respect to polarization @xmath33 and stress @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are dielectric stiffness and higher - order stiffness coefficients at constant stress , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are linear and nonlinear elastic compliances , @xmath41 is ordinary electrostriction , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are high - order electrostriction tensors .",
    "hereafter we assume summation over repeated indices .",
    "the minima of @xmath44 with respect to polarization correspond to the ground state of the mechanically free sample .",
    "the @xmath44 expansion is often used dealing with experimental data .",
    "alternatively , when working with _ ab initio _ calculations , instead of @xmath44 expansion one naturally can use the helmholtz thermodynamic function @xmath45 written in terms of polarization @xmath33 and strain @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are components of linear and high - order electrostrictive tensors , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are linear and non - linear stiffness tensors .",
    "the minima of @xmath45 correspond to the ground state of a fully mechanically clamped sample .",
    "the relationships between the @xmath40 and @xmath52 coefficients can be found by resolving the mechanical state equations for stress : @xmath53 and strain : @xmath54 eliminating , for example , stress @xmath34 between and and keeping linear terms in in view of the smallness of @xmath46 one can obtain : @xmath55    hereafter , in addition to standard voigt notations for stress @xmath56 , strain @xmath57 , elastic ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) @xcite and linear electrostriction ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) tensors , defining @xmath61 according to the landolt - bornstein reference book @xcite @xmath62 we use the voigt matrix notation for nonlinear elasticity ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) and high - order electrostriction ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ) tensors as follows : @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 the voigt matrix notation for the coefficients of the @xmath45 expansion are @xmath72 ; @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; and @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    knowing the @xmath60 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 coefficients of the @xmath45 expansion one can find the corresponding @xmath61 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 coefficients for expansion @xmath44 since both thermodynamic functions correspond to the same state equation .",
    "for example , one can find for @xmath77 : @xmath78 other relationships between coefficients of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in view of their complexity , are presented in appendix [ app_legendre_transform ] .",
    "to illustrate quantitatively the phenomenon described above in sec .",
    "[ s_scalar_model ] , we exploit an effective energy potential of a strained thin film of a single - domain ( 001)-oriented @xmath0 . to obtain the effective potential from the @xmath44 expansion : @xmath79 the minima of which correspond to the ground state of the film partially clamped on the substrate @xcite , we apply mixed mechanical conditions @xmath80 and eliminate stresses @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "hereafter a cartesian coordinate system with the @xmath84 axis perpendicular to the film - substrate interface is considered , @xmath85 - biaxial parent misfit strain , where @xmath86 is the lattice parameter of the ferroelectric material in the cubic phase extrapolated to temperature @xmath15 and @xmath87 is the in - plane lattice parameter of the film . minimizing @xmath88 with respect to polarization @xmath33 for each @xmath89 point",
    "one can find the polarization states of the thin film , i.e. one can build the phase diagram .    as it was mentioned in discussing the scalar model ,",
    "the high - order electrostrictive as well as nonlinear compliance coefficients lead to the changes in coefficients @xmath90 of @xmath91-terms while passing from a bulk crystal to the thin film ( @xmath92 ) . here",
    ", we give an example of such a change for @xmath93 : @xmath94 the other exact expressions of the @xmath90 change can be found in appendix [ app_bulk_film ] .",
    "to see what impact high - order interactions exert on the thin film effective potential @xmath19 , one has to know the values of the high - order electrostrictive and non - linear compliance coefficients . since the experimental information on the high - order coefficients is scarce we turned towards _",
    "ab initio _ methods , namely , we used the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite performing zero kelvin density functional theory ( dft ) full relaxation calculations .",
    "all calculations were performed within the generalized - gradient approximation as implemented in vasp using the projector augmented - wave method for the electron - ion interactions @xcite .",
    "we have used a 8x8x8 monkhorst - pack grid for k - point sampling @xcite , and a plane - wave energy cut - off of 600ev . for full relaxation calculations , the threshold of the hellman - feynman force was less than 1mev / a .",
    "we would like to underline that mechanical compliance and electrostriction in are expected to be weakly temperature dependent .",
    "this justifies the use of zero kelvin dft results in finite temperature calculations .    technically , because of working with dft , it is more convenient to use the @xmath45 expansion to calculate the high - order coefficients . stiffness @xmath59 and @xmath63 and electrostrictive @xmath60 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 coefficients can be found in the following way . using vasp",
    "we find stress @xmath56 on strain @xmath95 and polarization @xmath33 on strain @xmath95 dependences for different @xmath96 and @xmath97 , then , we use the mechanical state equation @xmath98 and determine the coefficients by fitting .",
    "polarization was calculated by the atomic displacements @xmath99 and born charges for the cubic phase @xmath100 : @xmath101 where @xmath96 enumerates the atoms in the unit cell , @xmath102 - the charge of electron , @xmath103 - volume of the cubic unit cell .",
    "it is possible to find @xmath59 and @xmath63 tensors separately from others ( @xmath60 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ) if one uses the mechanical state equation at zero polarization and models the deformation applied to the paraelectric cubic phase keeping the @xmath104 symmetry of the structure .",

    "it is possible to calculate all the components of the high - order electrostrictive tensors .",
    "the above described scheme requires a good accuracy of @xmath118 and @xmath119 dependences .",
    "unfortunately , because of the technical limitations of software we can not have reliable precision of the curvature of @xmath118 and @xmath119 and therefore reliable precision of @xmath66 coefficients .",
    "we clarify the matter with the example where only @xmath107 and @xmath116 are nonzero .",
    "one represents obtained with vasp @xmath107 and @xmath120 dependences as @xmath121 and inserts them into eq . .",
    "equating coefficients of powers of @xmath105 one has 3 independent equations : @xmath122 to find simultaneously 3 unknown values of @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "this way one has to consider the second derivatives of @xmath107 and @xmath116 dependences ( eq . ) which can not be reliably found with vasp .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the @xmath66 values found with vasp are in conflict with those obtained with experimental data .",
    "thus , we do not attempt to calculate the @xmath66 coefficients , and this way we use only the two lower - order independent equations .",
    "we realize that the exclusion of @xmath66 can cause the change of @xmath65 in , but the numerical calculations show that this leads to a small correction of @xmath65 .    the coefficients are calculated with errors as it can be seen from table [ table_vasp_coeff ] . the origin of the error of the coefficients is due to the computational limit of vasp causing the calculation error of atomic displacements and therefore polarization ( which was calculated by atomic displacements ) and stress @xmath5 .",
    "additionally the above described calculation scheme is iterative , one needs to use previously found coefficients to calculate new ones .",
    "for example , to find a coefficient @xmath123 which corresponds to the term @xmath124 one uses the mechanical equation of state keeping only @xmath113 , @xmath105 and @xmath125 components : @xmath126 then , using vasp we model stress and polarization , keeping @xmath127 : @xmath128 the @xmath129 and @xmath130 dependences obtained with vasp have some errors as well as the previously found @xmath108 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 coefficients .",
    "so , when the @xmath123 coefficient is calculated it contains an accumulating error of all previously found coefficients and clearly has lower precision then for example @xmath111 .",
    "due to the technical limitations of vasp we are unable to reliably determine the @xmath66 coefficients .",
