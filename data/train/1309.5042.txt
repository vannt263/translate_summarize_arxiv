    "the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite is one of the most used holographic qcd - models to study effective low - energy effects of a qcd - like theory at strong coupling .",
    "its main merits are the incorporation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , closely related to the description of confinement in the model , and the fact that previously constructed effective low - energy qcd models ( such as the skyrme model for pions , the hidden local symmetry approach for the coupling of pions and rho mesons , vector meson dominance for the pion formfactor , etc . ) drop out automatically .",
    "in this paper we further investigate the stability of the two - flavour sakai - sugimoto model in the presence of a magnetic field , and this in the confinement phase .",
    "we will find stability in the scalar and an instability in the charged vector sector .",
    "previous stability analyses of the sakai - sugimoto model ( ssm ) have mainly focused on the case of a background chemical potential . in particular chern - simons - induced instabilities to spatially",
    "modulated phases have received quite some attention recently @xcite .",
    "earlier works in this context include @xcite , and @xcite on the @xmath0 phase diagram in the sakai - sugimoto model .",
    "more relevant for our current purposes is the dbi - induced instability in the presence of an isospin chemical potential studied in @xcite , where a tachyonic instability of the rho meson and ensuing rho meson condensation was described",
    ". we will encounter a somewhat similar phenomenon here , but as a result of the presence of a background magnetic field @xmath1 and zero chemical potential .",
    "the papers referred to above which include magnetic fields , use the original antipodal ssm in which the flavour branes are positioned @xmath1-independently at opposite points on the supersymmetry - breaking circle of the background .",
    "we will focus on the more general non - antipodal embedding of flavour branes , in which case the embedding does depend on the magnetic field , corresponding to chiral magnetic catalysis in the dual field theory @xcite .",
    "the stability of the embedding of the flavour branes has been checked in @xcite for the antipodal case , and in @xcite for the non - antipodal case .",
    "we extend this analysis to the non - antipodal , @xmath1-dependent embedding , finding what we referred to as ` stability in the scalar sector ' earlier .",
    "we believe we are also the first to consider multiple non - antipodal embedded flavour branes @xmath2 that couple to the external magnetic field with different electric charges , modeling differently charged up- and down - quarks . taking this complication into account will create a magnetically induced splitting of the flavour branes , interpreted as explicit breaking of the @xmath3 chiral symmetry to a product of abelian @xmath4 chiral symmetries , which makes the evaluation of the symmetrized trace in the action significantly more cumbersome .    in the end , we find a holographic description of the instability towards rho meson condensation in the presence of a very strong magnetic field , first discussed in phenomenological qcd - models in @xcite .",
    "this is one of the many effects studied recently in the context of qcd in extreme conditions , a research area that has naturally gained more interest with the growing availability of data on quark - gluon plasma from lhc and rhic experiments .",
    "there , not only high temperatures and high densities are present , but also , when the plasma is created in non - central heavy ion collisions , very high magnetic fields ( of the order of @xmath5 tesla ) @xcite . for a review on strongly interacting matter in magnetic fields , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "many magnetic effects have been investigated in the sakai - sugimoto model , so , to avoid incompleteness , let us refer here to the review paper @xcite for a nice overview .",

    "we discuss the stability of the fluctuations .",
    "for that purpose we plug a flavour gauge field ansatz containing a background ( @xmath24 ) and a fluctuation part ( @xmath25 mesons ) into the non - abelian dbi - action governing the dynamics of the flavour gauge field living on the probe branes , and expand the action to second order in the fluctuations .",
    "the eventual goal is to extract the effective rho meson mass from the 4-dimensional mass equation for the vector meson , the effective 4-dimensional action to be obtained from the dbi - action by integrating out the extra dimensions .",
    "first , we have to choose a particular gauge to disentangle the scalar and vector fluctuations in the action , this is done in section [ gaugefixing ] .",
    "then we discuss the stability with respect to scalar fluctuations , corresponding to the positions of the probe branes .",
    "next , we consider the vector fluctuations .",
    "this we already partly covered in our previous paper @xcite , where we discussed the case of antipodal embedding and the case of non - antipodal embedding with the action approximated to second order in the total field strength @xmath26 and with the extra assumption of coinciding branes .",
    "here , we extend on these analyses by considering the non - antipodal embedding with magnetically separated branes , both in the case of using the action expanded to second order in @xmath26 ( section [ f2approx ] ) and the full non - linear dbi - action in @xmath26 ( section [ 4.4 ] ) . because the field strength @xmath26 in the dbi - action is accompanied with a factor proportional to the inverse of the t hooft coupling @xmath27 , which is large in the validity range of the gauge - gravity duality , the expansion to second order in @xmath26 is commonly used . however , in the presence of large background fields , the higher order terms may become important ( see section [ ambiguities ] ) .",
    "we therefore compare the outcome of using the @xmath28-approximated action versus the full dbi - action , from which we can conclude that the difference in @xmath6 is very small and the @xmath28-expansion was justified in our case after all .    in section [ f2approx ]",

    "the symmetrized trace ( str ) over flavour indices in the dbi - action no longer simplifies to a normal tr .",
    "instead , evaluating the str ( which can be done exactly to second order in the fluctuations ) gives rise to complicated functions in the action ( defined via integrals ) , which depend on the background fields and are discontinuous in the holographic radius @xmath29 .",
    "we pay some attention to solving the eigenvalue equation for the rho meson eigenfunction with these functions present .",
    "the evaluation of the str is discussed in section [ 4.1.1 ] , with the used  exact ",

    "[ 4.4 ] the focus is on handling the extra dependences on the magnetic field from considering the full dbi - action .",
    "the resulting effective 4-dimensional equation of motion ( eom ) ( to second order in the rho meson fields ) has extra terms compared to the standard proca eom used in phenomenological descriptions of the rho meson in a background magnetic field , making it harder to analyze .",

    "we are however very well aware of the fact that the full dbi - action is not the complete non - abelian action for a system of @xmath30 branes  a closed form of which is still to be found  , starting to show deviations at order @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "we do not claim the dbi - result is necessarily more correct than the @xmath28-result , yet we wanted to examine the extent of the difference . in conclusion ,",
    "the ssm - predictions for @xmath6 are close to order 1 gev@xmath89 , as obtained in the njl - model in @xcite and on the lattice in @xcite .    a main motivation for these comparisons within the ssm was to investigate what holography can add to the qcd - phenomenological picture of rho meson condensation , purposely working in a top - down",
    " the downside of which are the technical complications .",
    "we for example elaborated on evaluating the str exactly ( to second order in fluctuations in the presence of an abelian background field ) , the gauge fixing necessary to disentangle scalar and vector fluctuations , the contribution of the chern - simons action , the pion sector in the @xmath28-approximated dbi - part of the action , the higgs mechanism associated with the magnetically induced heavy - light character of the charged rho mesons , numerically solving the eigenvalue equation for @xmath329 with a shooting method , and analytically solving the generalized effective 4-dimensional eoms . for the above reasons of complexity we have not yet been able to construct the new ground state in which the rho mesons are condensed .",
    "this ground state is expected to be an abrikosov lattice of rho meson vortices , as constructed in the dsgs - model in @xcite and in a bottom - up holographic model in @xcite .",
    "the abrikosov lattice forms an anisotropic and spatially inhomogeneous , type ii superconducting ground state of the qcd vacuum in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xcite , with the interesting property that the magnetic field creates the superconducting state instead of destroying it ( cfr .",
    "meissner effect ) . in @xcite , the real part of the optical conductivity in the condensed phase",
    "is shown to contain a delta peak at the origin , consistent with a superconducting condensed state .",
    "another downside of the top - down approach and in particular the ssm is the abundance of extra fields in the bulk that do not have counterparts in the dual field theory .",
    "the mass scale @xmath623 of these artifacts of the model is actually of the same order as the masses of the mesons .",
    "nevertheless the ssm can present a nice record of qcd - effects and properties that can be modeled , suggesting the influence of the redundant modes is not necessarily substantial .",
    "we have been able to show that the ssm has a magnetically induced instability towards rho meson condensation , consistent with the studies of this phenomenon in phenomenological @xcite , lattice @xcite and bottom - up holographic @xcite approaches . to come closer to the real - life quark - gluon plasma conditions where the presence of magnetic fields of the order of @xmath624 gev@xmath89 might eventually be obtained , it should be taken into account that there are also very high temperatures / densities present , and that the magnetic field is very localized both in space and time ( see the more recent works cited under @xcite ) .",
    "these features may in the end seriously influence the possible occurrence of rho meson condensation .",
