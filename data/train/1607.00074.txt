    "periodic , irregular dips in the x - ray intensity of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) were first observed in the early 1980s @xcite .",
    "the dips are generally attributed to partial obscuration of the neutron star by a thickened region of the accretion disk close to the line joining the two centres of mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the dips are typically irregular in shape and depth , with duty cycle between 1030% , and ( in most systems ) are accompanied by an increase in the absorption column density .",
    "xb  1916@xmath6050 was the first such example discovered @xcite , with dips recurring at the @xmath8  min orbital period .",
    "@xcite described 4 systems showing periodic dips , and one additional system ( x  1624@xmath6490 ) in which the dips were not yet known to be periodic . since then",
    ", the list of known dippers has grown to include exo  0748@xmath6676 , 4u  1254@xmath669 ( xb  1254@xmath6690 ) , mxb  1659@xmath6298 , 4u  1746@xmath6371 , 4u  1323@xmath662 , xte  j1710@xmath6281 , grs  1747@xmath6312 , and possibly also xte  j1759@xmath6220 and 1a  1744@xmath6361 , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most recent discovery of dipping behaviour is in the 24.27-d binary and burst source , gx  13 + 1 @xcite .",
    "the dips are characterised by a decrease in x - ray intensity , and ( usually ) an increase in spectral hardness , arising from additional absorption at the low - energy ( @xmath9  kev ) part of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the lack of photoabsorption in shallow dips seen from x  1755@xmath6338 was explained by metal - poor obscuring material ; the required abundances are 1/600 of the solar value .",
    "similarly , a factor 1060 shortfall in degree of photoelectric absorption was also noted for xb  1916@xmath650 @xcite .",
    "dips may occur over @xmath5% of the orbital cycle , generally just prior to inferior conjunction , and culminating in some sources ( exo  0748@xmath6676 and mxb  1659@xmath6298 ) in an eclipse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inclination angle for dipping sources is thought to be higher than for the non - dippers , and for the systems which also show eclipses is higher again ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "conventionally , the sample of lmxbs was clearly divided into dippers ( which showed a dip in almost every orbital cycle ) and non - dippers , which never exhibited dips .",
    "a possible exception was the candidate absorption event reported from the ultracompact binary 4u  1820@xmath6303 @xcite following a search for high hardness ratios with heao a-2 .",
    "scanning observations of the source were made between 1977 august and 1978 march ; one of the scans , on 1977 sep 27 , 23:33:56 ut , was found with hardness ratio increased compared to previous scans by a factor of almost 3 .",
    "the neutral column density was inferred to have increased for the `` abnormal '' scan .",
    "because of the low duty cycle of the scanning observations , the duration of the event was not well constrained ( @xmath10  hr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ) although the variation was seemingly not related to the ( energy - independent ) orbital x - ray intensity modulation .",
    "recently , a single dipping event was observed by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) from the 18.95-hr binary aql  x-1   @xcite , not previously known as a dipping source .",
    "aql  x-1  is one of the most prolific x - ray transients known , exhibiting bright ( @xmath11 ) outbursts every few hundred days since 1969 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the transient outburst profiles are quite variable , with a range of durations and fluences noted by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in recent years , the source has exhibited `` long high '' outbursts in 2011 and 2013 , and weaker outbursts in each of the following years ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "here we describe in more details the properties of the event observed from aql  x-1 , and also report on a search for additional dipping events in a large sample of lmxbs .",
    "we analysed _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; ) observations of low - mass x - ray binaries assembled for the multi - instrument burst archive ( minbar ) .",
    "_ rxte _ , operational from its launch on 1995 december 30 through to the end - of - mission on 2012 january , consists of three instruments sensitive to cosmic x - rays : the all - sky monitor ( asm ) , the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) , and the proportional counter array ( pca ) .",
    "the pca is comprised of five identical proportional counter units ( pcus ) , sensitive to photons in the 260  kev energy range , and together presenting an effective area of approximately 6500  @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the field - of - view is approximately circular with a radius of 1  degree , determined by a passive hexagonal - lattice collimator , and the instrument offers no spatial resolution .",
    "photons detected by the pca are time - tagged to a precision of approximately @xmath13s , and processed by an array of on - board event analysers ( eas ) .",
    "two of the eas are dedicated to producing standard - mode analysis results ; standard-1 data offers no spectral resolution but 0.125  s binned lightcurves , while standard-2 data offers spectra accumulated every 16  s within 129 spectral channels covering the energy range .",
    "the minbar project builds on an earlier sample of bursts observed by _",
    "@xcite , and seeks to accumulate all observations of burst sources by _ rxte _ as well as _",
    "bepposax_/wfc and _ integral_/jem - x .",
    "as part of the data analysis pipeline for the minbar observations , we calculated soft and hard x - ray colours from the background - subtracted standard-2 lightcurves , as the ratio of counts in the 3.74.9  kev and 23.7  kev bands , and the 8.617.7  kev and 4.98.6  kev bands , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the analysis of @xcite , we made no correction for the gain changes throughout the lifetime of the instrument , as we focused on searches for dipping events usually within a single @xmath14  min orbit .",
    "the dipping activity in aql  x-1 during the observation on 2011 october 21 ( mjd 53715 ) was discovered serendipitously via inspection of the lightcurve around the time of a thermonuclear burst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  [ results ] ) .",
    "the dips were characterised by both soft and hard colours significantly in excess of the typical measurements before and after , in addition to a decrease in intensity .",
    "we subsequently used this event as a template to perform an exhaustive search in this and other systems with a substantial accumulated exposure with _ rxte _",
    ", as follows .    first , we filtered the colour measurements to exclude intervals with high variance , including unphysically large positive or negative values , usually attributable to low source intensity , e.g. at the end of a transient outburst .",
    "second , we divided the available data from each source into contiguous segments , in which the maximum allowed gap between segments was 0.006  d. we further selected only data segments with at least 10 data points , as it would not be possible to confirm a dip in a sparser segment .    from each segment we calculated the mean @xmath15 and standard deviation @xmath16 for each band @xmath17 ( hard and soft colours ) , and identified candidate events as high - significance outliers from the average distribution .",
    "we estimated the significance as @xmath18 and inspected only those measurements where @xmath19 was in excess of a threshold established empirically from the analysis of the aql  x-1 data , of @xmath20 .",
    "finally , we inspected the intensity data covering the dip candidate , to test for the coincident decrease in intensity expected for a genuine dipping event .",
    "the first instance of dipping behaviour detected from aql  x-1  was in an observation by _ rxte _ on 2011 october 21 ( obsid 96440 - 01 - 02 - 02 ) , eight days after the detection of a new outburst @xcite . beginning on october 21.579 ut ( mjd 55855.583 ) , a series of four dips were observed in the x - ray intensity , lasting between 560  s each ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dip2 ] ) .",
    "the first two dips were separated by 3.9  min ; then 7.8  min to the next two ( which occurred as a closely separated pair ) , and 9  min to the last .",
    "the observation ended 3  min later . during the second ( and deepest ) dip",
    ", the count rate was reduced to less than 20% of the level before or after ; the other dips reached between 3867% of the count rate before or after .",
    "one proportional counter unit ( pcu # 2 ) was operating , and the background - subtracted 260  kev count rate outside the dips was typically 470  counts  s@xmath2 .",
    "the fractional decrease in intensity during the dips was greatest at low energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dip2 ] ) , resulting in a hardening of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "both the soft and hard x - ray colours were significantly higher compared to the non - dip data . during the second ( and deepest ) dip ,",
    "the soft ( hard ) colour reached 4.0 ( 1.39 ) , compared to 1.3 ( 0.8 ) outside the dips .",
    "these values were discrepant from the mean colours for the observation at an estimated significance of 8.3 ( 6.4 )  @xmath21 ( table [ tab : aqlcand ] ) .     ]",
    "we carried out a search ( as described in  [ analysis ] ) for similar events in the entire sample of _ rxte _ observations of aql  x-1 , totalling 1.85  ms ( table [ tab : src ] ) .",
    "one additional candidate was found , on 2005 december 11 ( mjd 53715.173 ) , almost 6 years before the 2011 october event .",
    "this observation fell approximately one month after the start of the most recent outburst , which likely began on 2005 november 12 @xcite .",
    "only one interval with substantial ( @xmath22% ) reduction in intensity was observed in 2005 december , lasting approximately 34  s. the dip onset was gradual , but the recovery much steeper , similar in profile to the deepest dipping event observed in 2011 october .",
    "four pcus were active during the observation , but the intensity was lower than for the 2011 october event , by approximately a factor of two .",
    "the significance of the maximum deviation from the colour measurements during the observation was similar in both cases , at 68@xmath21 ( table [ tab : aqlcand ] ) .",
    "we also list in table [ tab : aqlcand ] the orbital phase range of the dip activity , based on the ephemeris for the 18.95-hr orbit adopted by @xcite .",
    "we calculated the phase @xmath23 of each data point at time @xmath24 , via @xmath25 where @xmath24 is the time of each data point , @xmath26 the orbital period , and @xmath27 the reference time ( inferior conjunction ) . both @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "have associated uncertainties , so the calculated orbital phase value will also have an uncertainty which grows with time elapsed since the ephemeris epoch:@xmath30 where @xmath31 is the uncertainty in quantity @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the number of orbital cycles that has elapsed between the reference epoch @xmath27 and the observation time @xmath24 . for both events observed in aql  x-1 , the phase is consistent with the range of orbital phases where dipping is most common for lmxbs ( taking into account the uncertainty ) .",
    "we estimate the probability of such an agreement by chance as approximately 2.6% .",
    "we calculated the equivalent exposure time for dips in the _ rxte _ sample as the ( fractional ) number of orbital cycles for which the entire phase range of interest ( 0.71.0 ) would be covered .",
    "for aql  x-1 , we calculate the total exposure in this phase range as 26.7  cycles .",
    "we then estimated the average likelihood of dips for aql  x-1  as 2 per 26.7 equivalent cycles covered , or an overall dip frequency of roughly @xmath34  cycle@xmath2 . by assuming that the number of dips detected is poisson - distributed",
    ", we can more precisely estimate the likely range of the dip occurrence frequency of @xmath1  cycle@xmath2 .",
    "in practise , the data covering each dip phase may be incomplete , interrupted by ( satellite ) orbital data gaps and scheduled observations of other sources .",
    "we may have missed additional dips in those data gaps , due to incomplete coverage of the dip phase .",
    "thus , the dip occurrence frequency calculated above must be considered a lower limit to the actual dip frequency .    .aql",
    "x-1 dip candidates and their associated properties [ tab : aqlcand ] [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the intermittent decrease in intensity observed during two outbursts of aql  x-1 , within the orbital phase range in which dipping behaviour is seen in other lmxbs , and coupled with the evidence for elevated neutral column density , confirms these events as arising from the same physical cause as the regular dips seen in high - inclination lmxb systems .",
    "these events are the first confirmed `` intermittent '' dips in a lmxb system , although not the first claimed .",
    "the candidate event reported from heao  a-2 data of 4u  1820@xmath6303 @xcite helped to motivate our own search of 1500  ks of _ rxte _ observations of this source , comprising 2186  total orbit equivalents of exposure in the 0.71.0 phase range .",
    "however , this search resulted in no plausible dip candidates .",
    "spectral analysis of the dipping events observed in aql  x-1 indicates that both the neutral column density @xmath35 and the continuum normalisation @xmath36 vary significantly compared to the non - dip spectra .",
    "this behaviour is commonly found in ( consistently ) dipping systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has been attributed to absorption by partially ionised material , possibly with abundances deviating significantly from solar , and/or partial covering of the ( possibly extended ) emission region .    while the complete sample of _ rxte _ observations of aql x-1 have covered other inferior conjunctions , no additional dipping behaviour has been observed .",
    "based on the total exposure of the orbital phase in which dips are most often observed in other sources , we estimate the average frequency for dips in aql  x-1  as @xmath1  cycle@xmath2 .",
    "we also searched the accumulated _ rxte _ data from 24  other systems for intermittent dipping activity , without success .",
    "for the system with the largest exposure of the dip phase range , 4u  1820@xmath6303 , we place an upper limit on the dip frequency of @xmath7  cycle@xmath2  ( 95% ) .",
    "the _ rxte _ sample allows weak constraints to be placed on the duration of the dipping behaviour in aql  x-1 .",
    "we inspected observations before and after each dip , selecting those data which fell in the usual dipping phase range of 0.71.0 .",
    "we also searched for data covering the precise phase range of the deepest dipping features , since in other sources these features may persist for multiple orbital periods .",
    "for the 2005 december dip , we had partial coverage of the dipping phase range 3.9  d before and 1.4  d after .",
    "this corresponds to 5 cycles before and 2 after , with the data coverage of the range in each case totalling approximately 31% .",
    "we translate these figures to a @xmath5% chance of detecting dipping behaviour in each observation , had it been present ; since no dips were detected , we can constrain the duration of the dipping behaviour to @xmath37  d ( 7 orbital cycles ) at @xmath38 confidence .",
    "neither of these observations , however , included the precise orbital phase range in which the 2005 dec dip was observed ( table [ tab : aqlcand ] ) .",
    "the closest coverage of that range was found 240  d before and after the dip observation .",
    "even poorer coverage was achieved for the 2011 october dip .",
    "the closest observation covering the 0.71.0 phase range before the dip was 388  d earlier ; after , 6.9  d ( 9 cycles ) .",
    "the coverage of the dipping phase range for the latter observations was only 9% .",
    "the closest observations covering the precise phase range of the deepest dip observed in 2011 october were 684  d earlier , or 8.7  d ( 11 cycles ) after .",
    "this latter observation likely provides the most stringent constraint on the duration of the dipping activity from the _ rxte _ data .",
    "we consider three possible explanations for the apparent dipping behaviour in aql  x-1 .",
    "first , that the system inclination is intermediate between the population of non - dippers and dippers , such that the normal activity of the disk occasionally allows material at the outer edge to cross the line of sight .",
    "according to this explanation , any system with an inclination within some range @xmath39 would exhibit intermittent dipping behaviour , given enough observational data . to determine the probability distributions of the angles",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 , as well as the additional limit @xmath42 above which a source will exhibit eclipses , we make the following assumptions : 1 .",
    "the fraction of sources in each group is proportional to @xmath43 ; 2 .",
    "the number of sources detected in each category is poisson - distributed about the expected value ; 3 .",
    "the expected number of intermittent dipping sources detected is lower by a factor of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the typical number of dip phase orbit equivalents observed for each source . this latter factor incorporates both the estimated frequency of dips for intermittent sources , as measured in aql  x-1 , as well as the typical number of dip phases observed .",
    "here we adopt the median _ rxte _ exposure for all the burst sources of 55  ks , and the median orbital period , of 4.65  hr , to calculate @xmath46 .    for each angle",
    "@xmath47 we then marginalise over the other two angles , adopting the observed population of intermittent dipping : consistently dipping : eclipsing sources , of 1:14:5 ( from a total of 106 ) to obtain the probability distributions as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : angles ] .",
    "we find that the most probable range for each angle is @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ( 68% confidence ; central value given has the highest probability of the pdf ) .",
    "we note that the width of the distribution for @xmath40 is quite sensitive to the value adopted for @xmath45 .",
    "our analysis suggests that the inclination for aql  x-1  is in the range 72@xmath3 .",
    "previous estimates of the inclination of aql  x-1  based on optical light curve modelling were confounded by the contribution of light from a nearby unrelated star ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the derived range from our analysis is broadly consistent with the estimate of @xcite based on the photometric modulation during outburst , of @xmath51 .",
    "interestingly , the additional evidence for high inclination provided by the detection of dips , lends further support to the case for a massive ( @xmath52 ) neutron star @xcite .",
    "since the estimated inclination range for the intermittent dippers is so wide , there are likely @xmath53 other intermittent dippers in the burster sample , and perhaps the same number in the non - burster lmxb population .",
    "that dips have not been detected from any of these @xmath5 other systems is a consequence of the low dipping frequency , as well as the paucity of data covering the preferred dip orbital phase .",
    "( _ solid line _ ) ; intermittent and consistent dippers @xmath41 ( _ dotted line _ ) ; and dippers and eclipsing sources @xmath42 ( _ dashed line _ ) .",
    "the probability distributions are based on the fraction of dipping and eclipsing sources in the minbar sample of bursters .",
    "the overall normalisation scale is arbitrary , but consistent for each angle .",
    "[ fig : angles ] ]      a second possibility for the presence of intermittent dips in aql  x-1   is that the accretion disk in this system is subject to precession , such that the normal vector to the disk plane rotates around the orbital angular momentum axis , bringing the outer edge of the disk into the line - of - sight periodically .",
    "precession in lmxbs is perhaps best known in the pulsar her  x-1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where a 35-d `` superorbital '' cycle has the disk periodically obscuring the pulsar at it s centre .",
    "precession has been suggested to explain quasi - periodic variability of persistent lmxbs ( e.g. 4u  1728@xmath634 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the relatively subtle effects would likely be indistinguishable from the much higher amplitude variability in transients .",
    "while our results allow candidate precession periods to be calculated , these are not constrained due to the limited number of events ( 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear if a precession signal would persist over multiple outburst - quiescence cycles .",
    "third , the serendipitous observation of dips may be related to changes in the disk structure , perhaps resulting from a change in the disk geometry ( signalled by a spectral state transition ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) around the time of the dips . in the _ rxte",
    "_ observations subsequent to the 2011 dip , from october 24 onwards , the overall intensity was significantly higher , with soft colour remaining between 1.2 - 1.3 , but the hard colour decreasing to between 0.32 - 0.4 .",
    "this increase in intensity , coupled with spectral softening , likely indicates a transition from the `` island '' ( hard ) spectral state to the `` banana '' ( soft ) state some time between october 21 and 24 .",
    "however , no such transition was observed around the time of the 2005 dip , nor at anytime during that outburst , which was much weaker than that in 2011 .",
    "we report the detection by _ rxte _ of a pair of events in aql  x-1  with properties consistent with the dips found in a subset of low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "these events are the first such `` intermittent '' dips confirmed for a lmxb ; given the accumulated exposure on this source , the estimated rate of such events is @xmath1  cycle@xmath2 .",
    "the spectral analysis of the dip segments shows that the inferred neutral column density @xmath35 is elevated typically by an order of magnitude , and up to almost two orders of magnitude , compared to the non - dipping value . assuming that the dips arise in aql  x-1  by virtue of a higher - than - average inclination , the implied range is 72@xmath3",
    "; this is in excess of most other estimates for the source . given the difficulty of detecting such events in other systems , it is possible that an additional 15 systems may be undetected intermittent dippers . of the possible explanations of the intermittent dipping behaviour , the high inclination seems the most plausible .",
    "we also report on a search of 24  additional systems for dips , which was unsuccessful .",
    "for the system with the largest exposure , 4u  1636@xmath6536 , we derive an upper limit on the dip rate of @xmath54  cycle@xmath2  ( 95% ) .",
