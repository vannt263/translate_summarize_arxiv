    "the classical cake - cutting problem of steinhaus @xcite asks how to cut a cake fairly among several players , that is , how to divide the cake and assign pieces to players in such a way that each person gets what he or she believes to be a fair share .",
    "the word _ cake _ refers to any divisible good , and the word _ fair _ can be interpreted in many ways . a strong notion of a fair division is an _ envy - free _ division ,",
    "one in which every player believes that their share is better than any other share .",
    "existence of envy - free cake divisions dates back to neyman @xcite , but constructive solutions are harder to come by ; the recent procedure of brams and taylor @xcite was the first @xmath0-person envy - free solution .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for surveys .",
    "it is natural to consider the cake - cutting question when there is more than one cake to divide .",
    "given several cakes , does an envy - free division of the cakes exist , and under what conditions can such a division be guaranteed",
    "?    of course , if the player preferences over each cake are independent ( i.e. , additively separable ) , then the problem can be solved by one - cake division methods simply perform an envy - free division on each cake separately .",
    "so the question only becomes interesting when the players have _ linked _ preferences over the cakes , in which the portion of one cake that a player prefers is influenced by the portion of another cake that she might also obtain .",
    "consider the case of two players , alice and bob , dividing two cakes .",
    "suppose that each cake is to be cut into two pieces by a single cut , and players may choose one piece from each cake ( called a _ piece selection _ ) .",
    "note that there are 4 possible piece selections , only 2 of which will be chosen by alice and bob .",
    "see figure [ pieceselection ] .",
    "we would like the 2 chosen piece selections to be _ disjoint _ , i.e. , have no common piece on either cake , if bob and alice are to avoid a fight .",
    "also , we would like their piece selections to be _ envy - free _ , which means that each player would not want to trade their piece selection for any of other 3 possible piece selections .",
    "we remark that this notion of _ envy - free piece selection _ is stronger than the notion of an _ envy - free allocation _ , in which after pieces are allocated to players , a given player is only comparing their piece selection to what other players actually receive ( in this example , there is just 1 other piece selection that s been assigned to a player ) .",
    "our stronger notion of envy - freeness for piece selections ensures that the allocation is pareto - optimal over all possible piece selections in that division .",
    "does there always exist a division of the cakes ( by single cuts ) so that the players have disjoint envy - free piece selections ?     and @xmath1 , respectively.,height=96 ]    consider the following scenario as an example of this generalized cake - cutting question .",
    "a company employs two part - time employees alice and bob who work half - days ( either a morning or an afternoon shift ) two days each week . between them",
    ", they should cover the entire day on each of those two days .",
    "now , alice and bob may have certain preferences ( such as preferring a morning or afternoon shift ) and such preferences may be linked ( e.g. , alice might highly prefer the same schedule both days , whereas bob might prefer to have a morning shift on one day if he has the afternoon on another ) .",
    "their boss would like to account for both of their preferences .",
    "suppose that she has a certain fixed amount of salary money per day to divide up between the morning and afternoon shifts .",
    "is there always a way to split the daily salary pool among the shifts so that alice and bob will choose different shifts ?",
    "if so , is there a method to find it ? if not , why not ? here , the cakes are the salary pools for each day , and the pieces of cake are the shift assignments along with their salary .",
    "in this paper we examine what can be said about envy - free assignments in situations like this one .",
    "in particular , we show that for two cakes , single cuts on each cake are insufficient to guarantee an envy - free allocation of piece selections to players ; there exist preferences that alice and bob could have for which it is impossible to cut the cakes so that they would prefer disjoint piece selections . however , if one of those two cakes is divided into 3 pieces , then , somewhat surprisingly , there does exist an envy - free allocation of piece selections to players ( with one unassigned piece ) .    similarly , for three or more cakes",
    ", cutting each cake into three pieces is not sufficient to guarantee the existence of an envy - free allocation of piece selections to two players .",
    "however , if each cake is cut into four pieces , we find that such an allocation is always possible .",
    "these results are reminiscent of the cake - cutting procedure of brams and taylor @xcite in which the authors show that for more than two players , the number of pieces required to ensure an envy - free division is strictly larger than the number of players .",
    "here , however , we find that extra pieces are necessary even in the two - player case .",
    "the key idea here is to view the space of possible divisions as a _",
    "polytope _ ; we triangulate this polytope and label each vertex in a way that reflects player preferences for piece selections in the division that the vertex represents .",
    "the labels satisfy the conditions of a generalization of sperner s lemma @xcite to polytopes ; its conclusion suggests a division and a disjoint allocation of piece selections to players that is envy - free , and pareto - optimal with respect to all possible piece selections in that division .",
    "sperner s lemma @xcite is a combinatorial analogue of the brouwer fixed point theorem , one of the most important theorems of mathematics and economics",
    ". constructive proofs of sperner s lemma can be used to prove the brouwer theorem in a constructive fashion ; such proofs have therefore found wide application in game theory and mathematical economics to locate fixed points as well as nash equilibria ( e.g. , see @xcite for surveys ) .",
    "more recently , sperner s lemma and related combinatorial theorems have been used to show the existence of envy - free divisions for a variety of _ fair division problems _ , including the classical cake - cutting question , e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will use a recent generalization of sperner s lemma to polytopes @xcite to address our generalized cake - cutting question .    before describing sperner s lemma or its generalization ,",
    "we review some terminology .",
    "@xmath2-simplex _ is a generalization of a triangle or tetrahedron to @xmath2 dimensions : it is the convex hull of @xmath3 affinely independent points in @xmath4 .",
    "a polytope @xmath5 in @xmath4 is the convex hull of @xmath0 points @xmath6 , called the _ vertices _ of the polytope .",
    "we call an @xmath0-vertex , @xmath2-dimensional polytope an _ @xmath7-polytope_. a _ face _ of a polytope is the convex hull of any subset of the vertices of that polytope ; a @xmath8-dimensional face of @xmath5 is called a _",
    "facet_.    a _ triangulation _ @xmath9 of @xmath5 is a finite collection of distinct simplices such that : ( i ) the union of all the simplices in @xmath9 is @xmath5 , ( ii ) the intersection of any two simplices in @xmath9 is either empty or a face common to both simplices and ( iii ) every face of a simplex in @xmath9 is also in @xmath9 .",
    "the vertices of simplices in @xmath9 are called _ vertices of the triangulation _ @xmath9 .    a _ sperner labeling _ of @xmath9 is a labeling of the vertices of @xmath9 that satisfies these conditions : ( 1 ) all vertices of @xmath5 have distinct labels and ( 2 ) the label of any vertex of @xmath9 which lies on a facet of @xmath5 matches the label of one of the vertices of @xmath5 that spans that facet .",
    "a _ full cell _ is any @xmath2-dimensional simplex in @xmath9 whose @xmath3 vertices possess distinct labels",
    ". see figure [ sperner ] for examples of sperner - labeled polygons ( with full cells shaded ) .",
    "sperner s lemma @xcite states that any sperner - labeled triangulation of a simplex contains an odd number of full cells .",
    "the generalization which will be of use to us is :    any sperner - labeled triangulation of an @xmath7-polytope @xmath5 must contain at least @xmath10 full cells .",
    "[ polytopalsperner ]    for instance , the sperner - labelled pentagon in figure [ sperner ] has at least @xmath11 full cells .",
    "-polytope ) .",
    "full cells are shaded.,height=240 ]    the polytope that will interest us is the _ polytope of divisions _ , which we describe presently .",
    "suppose that we have @xmath12 cakes , each of length 1 , and that each cake is to be cut into @xmath13 pieces .",
    "let the length of the @xmath14-th piece of the @xmath15-th cake be denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "then for all @xmath17 we have @xmath18    each such division can be represented by an @xmath19 matrix :    @xmath20    where each row sum is 1 .    now",
    ", suppose that each cake is cut in such a way that one piece is the entire cake and all other pieces are empty .",
    "we will call such a  division \" of the cakes a _ pure division_. the matrix representation of a pure division is one in which each row has exactly one entry as a 1 and the rest 0 .",
    "notice that any division may be written as a convex linear combination of the pure divisions .",
    "thus , it is natural to view the space of divisions as a polytope @xmath5 with the pure divisions as its vertices .",
    "we call @xmath5 the _ polytope of divisions_. from the matrix representation of this polytope we see that the space of divisions is of dimension @xmath21 , since in each of the @xmath12 cakes , the length of the last piece is determined by the lengths of the first @xmath22 pieces .",
    "also @xmath5 has @xmath23 vertices , one for each pure division .",
    "thus @xmath5 is an @xmath7-polytope with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we now describe how to locate envy - free piece selections using the polytope of divisions @xmath5 .",
    "suppose that there are two players , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a triangulation of @xmath5 .",
    "next , label @xmath9 with an _ owner - labeling _ : label each vertex in @xmath9 with either @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "we will want this owner - labeling to satisfy the condition that each simplex in @xmath9 has roughly the same number of @xmath26 and @xmath27 labels .    in general , for any number of players , call an owner - labeling _",
    "uniform _ if in each simplex , the number of labels for each player differs by at most one from any other player .",
    "so for two players @xmath26 and @xmath27 , if a simplex @xmath28 in @xmath9 has @xmath0 vertices , a uniform labeling would assign labels @xmath26 and @xmath27 to @xmath29 vertices each if @xmath0 is even , and to at least @xmath30 vertices each if @xmath0 is odd .",
    "we claim that any polytope has a triangulation of arbitrarily small mesh size that can be given a uniform owner - labeling .",
    "in particular , this may be accomplished by choosing a triangulation @xmath9 of the required mesh size , and _ barycentrically subdividing _",
    "barycentric subdivision _ takes a @xmath13 simplex @xmath28 of @xmath9 , and replaces it by @xmath31 smaller @xmath13-simplices whose vertices are the barycenters of an increasing saturated chain of faces of @xmath28 .",
    "since each smaller @xmath13-simplex contains exactly one barycenter in each dimension , we may assign the even - dimensional barycenters to player @xmath26 and the odd - dimensional barycenters to @xmath27",
    ". this owner - labeling is uniform for players @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "see figure [ owner ] for an example of a barycentric subdivision with a uniform owner - labeling .",
    "( if there are more than two players , then cyclically rotate player assignments by dimension ) .     and @xmath27.,height=144 ]",
    "now that the ownership has been assigned to the vertices of @xmath9 , we shall construct a _ preference - labeling _ of @xmath9 .    given",
    "a division ( not necessarily pure ) of the @xmath12 cakes , a _ piece selection _ is a choice of one piece from each cake .",
    "we say that a player _ prefers _",
    "a certain piece selection if that player does not think that any other piece selection is better .",
    "we make the following three assumptions about preferences :    \\(1 ) _ independence of preferences_. a player s preferences depend only on that player and not on choices made by other players .",
    "\\(2 ) _ the players are hungry_. a player will always prefer a nonempty piece in each cake to an empty piece in that cake ( assuming the pieces selected in the other cakes are fixed ) .",
    "hence a preferred piece selection will contain no empty pieces .",
    "\\(3 ) _ preference sets are closed_. if a piece selection is preferred for a convergent sequence of divisions , then that piece selection will be preferred in the limiting division .",
    "note that with these assumptions about player preferences , a given player always prefers at least one piece selection in any division and may prefer more than one if that player is indifferent between piece selections .",
    "we now construct the preference - labeling of @xmath9 .",
    "notice that a vertex @xmath32 of @xmath9 is just a point in @xmath5 and so it represents a division of the cakes .",
    "ask the owner of @xmath32 ( who is either @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) : @xmath33 label @xmath32 by the answer given . since every piece selection corresponds to a pure division in a natural way ( namely , each may be thought of as a choice of one piece from each cake )",
    ", we obtain a preference - labeling of the vertices of @xmath9 by pure divisions .",
    "this new labeling is , in fact , a sperner labeling . to see why , note that each vertex of @xmath5 is a pure division , and condition ( 2 ) ensures that the player who owns that vertex will select the unique non - empty piece from each cake .",
    "so , every vertex of @xmath5 will be labeled by its corresponding pure division .",
    "a vertex @xmath32 of @xmath9 that lies on a facet of @xmath5 is a strict convex linear combination of the subset of vertices of @xmath5 that span that facet .",
    "thus , the division represented by @xmath32 is a strict convex linear combination of the subset of pure divisions that are represented by the vertices that span the facet .",
    "so , if the @xmath15-th piece ( on any cake ) of the division represented by @xmath32 is empty , then each of those pure divisions must have an empty @xmath15-th piece as well .",
    "so condition ( 2 ) guarantees that the owner of @xmath32 will never prefer a piece selection that corresponds to a pure division that is not on the same facet as @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the preference - labeling is a sperner labeling .",
    "the polytopal sperner lemma shows that there exist @xmath10 @xmath2-dimensional , full cells in @xmath9 .",
    "the owner labeling of each of these cells is uniform .",
    "hence , a full cell represents @xmath3 similar divisions in which players @xmath26 and @xmath27 choose different piece selections .",
    "now , if we repeat this procedure for a sequence of finer and finer triangulations of @xmath5 , we would create a sequence of smaller and smaller full cells .",
    "since @xmath5 is compact , there must be a convergent subsequence of full cells that converges to a single point .",
    "since each full cell in the convergent subsequence also has a uniform owner labeling and since there are only finitely many ways to choose a piece selection , there must be an infinite subsequence of our convergent sequence for which the piece selections of each player remain unchanged .",
    "condition ( 3 ) guarantees that the selections will not change at the limit point of these full cells .",
    "so , at this limit point , the players choose different piece selections just as they did in the cells of the sequence .",
    "in this way , we may find a division for which both players choose _ different _ piece selections , that is , selections where the players choose different pieces on _ at least one _ cake .",
    "more generally , with any number of players , the same arguments ( using a uniform - labelling over multiple players ) show :    [ notdisjoint ] given @xmath34 players and @xmath12 cakes , if each cake is cut into @xmath13 pieces each and @xmath35 , then there exists a division of the cakes for which each player chooses _ different _ ( though not necessarily disjoint ) piece selections .",
    "in particular , this theorem holds if each cake is cut into @xmath36 pieces .",
    "the bound on the number of pieces comes from the fact that the number of vertices of the simplex must be at least as large as the number of players so that each player owns at least one vertex of the full cell .",
    "the conclusion says that the piece selections chosen are _ envy - free _ : no one would trade their piece selection for any other .",
    "however , this theorem does not help us allocate the pieces , because two different players may have conflicting piece selections if they chose the same piece on a particular cake .",
    "so we wish to find divisions for which the players make _ disjoint _ envy - free piece selections , i.e. , selections where the players would choose non - conflicting pieces on _ every _ cake .",
    "we remark that such an allocation would be pareto - optimal with respect to all possible piece selections in that division .",
    "this is because each player would have chosen , over _ all piece selections _",
    ", what he / she most prefers .",
    "so there would be no other allocation of pieces of a given division in which players could do better .",
    "we explain this in contrast to an interesting example of brams , edelman , and fishburn @xcite , who consider a single cake cut into 6 pieces in which 3 players choose 2 pieces each .",
    "they exhibit a division and allocation of a pair of pieces to each player in such a way that the allocation is envy - free but not pareto optimal , because for the given 6-piece division there is another allocation in which some players are better off . although theirs was an _ envy - free allocation _ ( involving comparisons of 3 allocated pairs of pieces ) , those pairs were not _ envy - free piece selections _ ( involving comparisons of 30 possible pairs of pieces ) .",
    "an division into envy - free piece selections would by nature yield a pareto - optimal allocation with respect to the given division . in what follows we explore the existence of disjoint envy - free piece selections .",
    "[ sec2ck2pc ] we now explore what happens when two cakes , each cut into two pieces , are divided among two players : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . we show :    given 2 players and 2 cakes , there does not necessarily exist a division of the cakes into 2 pieces each that contains disjoint envy - free piece selections for those players .",
    "[ thm:2cakes2pieces ]    let @xmath5 be the polytope of divisions . in this case , @xmath5 is a @xmath37-polytope , i.e. , a square .",
    "we label the pure divisions as follows : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath1 , where , for instance , @xmath38 represents the pure division in which the left pieces of figure [ pieceselection ] are the entire cakes .",
    "recall that the same names @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath1 , @xmath40 can be used to reference piece selections . also note that @xmath38 and @xmath40 represent disjoint piece selections , and so do @xmath39 and @xmath1 .",
    "player a s preferences can be described by a _ cover _ of the square @xmath5 by four sets , labeled by piece selections:@xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath1 , @xmath40 .",
    "this is accomplished by placing point @xmath34 in @xmath5 in the set @xmath41 if in the division of cake represented by @xmath34 , player @xmath26 would prefer piece selection @xmath41 .",
    "some points may be in multiple sets ( representing indifference between piece selections ) .",
    "assumption ( 3 ) about preferences ( see previous section ) ensures that the four sets are closed .",
    "the union of the four sets contains @xmath5 .",
    "assumption ( 2 ) about preferences ensures that the pure divisions are in the sets that bear their own name .    in a similar fashion ,",
    "player @xmath27 also has a cover by four sets that describes his preferences . to find a division that allows for disjoint envy - free piece selections ,",
    "we seek a point @xmath34 in @xmath5 such that @xmath34 is in one player s @xmath38 set and the other s @xmath40 set , or in one player s @xmath39 set and the other s @xmath1 set .",
    "now consider the player preferences shown in figure [ 2ck2pc ] , where we assume that each set is labeled by the pure division that it contains .",
    "a visual inspection shows that there is no such point @xmath34 as described above .",
    "therefore , it is not necessarily possible to divide two cakes into two pieces in such a way that the two players will choose different pieces on each cake , i.e. , find disjoint piece selections .",
    "this result may seem somewhat unexpected , since if preferences are not linked , we can divide each individual cake in such a way that both players would be satisfied with their piece on each individual cake .",
    "an interpretation of figure [ 2ck2pc ] provides an example of linked preferences .",
    "player @xmath26 generally seems to either want the left hand or the right hand pieces of both cakes , and player @xmath27 generally wants both a left and a right hand piece ( in both cases , as long as the pieces are not too small ) . in our running example from the introduction , the preferences in figure [ 2ck2pc ] would correspond to alice strongly desiring to work either both morning or both afternoon shifts , and bob strongly desiring to work one morning and one afternoon shift .",
    "there may then be no division of the salary pool on each day that will induce them to take disjoint shifts .",
    "one may ask why the arguments of the previous section do not extend here .",
    "the answer is that while in each triangulation we can ensure an @xmath26-@xmath27 edge ( in owner - labels ) that corresponds to endpoints with different preference - labels , we can not ensure that the corresponding piece selections are disjoint .",
    "indeed we see from figure [ 2ck2pc ] that if @xmath5 is triangulated very finely , there will be no @xmath26-@xmath27 edge ( in owner - labels ) that could possibly be @xmath38-@xmath40 or @xmath39-@xmath1 ( in preference - labels ) since the corresponding players sets in the figure are not close .",
    "in contrast to theorem [ thm:2cakes2pieces ] , we may obtain a positive result for two players when there are three players involved .    given 3 players and 2 cakes , there exists a division of the cakes , each cut into 2 pieces , such that some pair of players has disjoint envy - free piece selections .    with three players ,",
    "consider an owner - labeling in which every triangle has vertices labeled by @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath42 , so that each vertex of the triangle belongs to a different player .",
    "note that a fully labeled triangle in the square of all divisions must contain a pair of disjoint piece selections .",
    "so , there is a pair of players who prefer disjoint piece selections for two very close divisions . using the limiting argument of section [ spernermethod ] ,",
    "there is a division in which some pair of players has disjoint envy - free piece selections .",
    "while there does not necessarily exist an envy - free allocation for two players with each cake cut into two pieces , we can satisfy both players with one cake cut into three pieces and the other cut in ( only ) two pieces .",
    "the proof of this fact , and later results for three cakes , will use the following theorem :    let @xmath5 be an @xmath7-polytope with sperner - labeled triangulation @xmath9 .",

    "non - conflicting choices for @xmath27 are @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 ; however , the @xmath62 pieces in the first two cakes have size greater than @xmath61 , so the piece selections @xmath60 , @xmath68 or @xmath60 would be preferred by @xmath27 to the previous options , respectively . these conflict with @xmath26 s piece selection in one of the first two cakes .",
    "finally , suppose @xmath26 chooses three different types of pieces , for example , @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath26 would prefer @xmath65 or @xmath67 to @xmath60 , it must be that @xmath62 is the only piece of size greater than @xmath61 in the first cake .",
    "therefore @xmath27 will also choose piece @xmath62 from the first cake , and @xmath26 s and @xmath27 s piece selections will not be disjoint .",
    "we have shown that a division with disjoint envy - free piece selections for two players need not exist for three cakes divided into three pieces each .",
    "it is easy to see that the same is true for four or more cakes .",
    "simply have the players adopt the preferences described above on the first three cakes .",
    "we now show that if , instead , the three cakes are each divided into four or more pieces , we can always find a division with envy - free piece selections for two players .",
    "given 2 players and 3 cakes , there exists a division of the cakes into 4 ( or more ) pieces each that contains disjoint envy - free piece selections for both players .",
    "as before , the idea of the proof is to use the polytopal sperner lemma ( theorem [ polytopalsperner ] ) on the @xmath69-dimensional space of divisions @xmath5 .",
    "however , our task is made much simpler by focusing on a particular full cell : the one that covers the center of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the ( 64,9)-polytope in @xmath70 of divisions of 3 cakes into 4 pieces each , and let @xmath9 be a triangulation of @xmath5 with a uniform owner labeling . by theorem",
    "[ cover ] , the fully - labeled cells of @xmath9 cover @xmath5 under the map @xmath44 .",
    "hence , for at least one fully - labeled 9-simplex @xmath28 , @xmath47 contains the center of @xmath5 .",
    "that is , there exist weights @xmath71 , such that @xmath72 where the @xmath73 are the matrices of the pure divisions corresponding to the vertices of @xmath47 , and @xmath74 is the @xmath75 matrix in which every entry is 1/4 ( this is the center of @xmath5 ) .    ,",
    "the pure divisions , arranged in a @xmath76 grid .",
    "these also may be thought of as piece selections , and two piece selections are disjoint if and only if they do not lie on the same grid plane.,height=216 ]    it will be convenient to visualize the vertices of @xmath5 arranged on a @xmath76 grid , since there are four pieces @xmath77 that may be selected for each of three cakes ( see figure [ 12planes ] ) .",
    "note that there are four planes in each of the 3 orthogonal grid directions ; in the rest of the proof , a _ plane _ will refer to one of these 12 special planes .",
    "for example , the bottom horizontal plane contains all vertices of @xmath5 corresponding to pure divisions in which piece @xmath62 is picked in the 3rd cake . in fact , any given plane corresponds to pure divisions in which a particular piece in a particular cake is chosen .",
    "the matrices corresponding to such divisions all have a 1 in the same entry . since @xmath74 is a weighted average of @xmath78-@xmath79 matrices @xmath73 that represent pure divisions , and matrices with a @xmath79 in a particular entry correspond to vertices in our grid that lie on a common plane , the total weight of vertices of @xmath47 that lie on a given plane of our grid must be @xmath80 .",
    "all of our arguments will be based on this fact .",
    "a vertex in our @xmath76 grid may also be thought of as a piece selection . by doing so",
    ", we see that two piece selections lie on a common plane if and only if they are not disjoint .",
    "recall that @xmath28 denotes the full cell whose image @xmath47 contains the center of @xmath5 .",
    "consider a graph @xmath81 whose nodes are the labels of @xmath28 , and in which two nodes are adjacent in @xmath81 if and only if they represent disjoint piece selections , i.e. , if and only if their labels do not lie on a common plane in figure [ 12planes ] .",
    "_ we now show , in all arguments that follow , that @xmath81 has a connected component of size at least @xmath82 .",
    "_ since the uniform owner labeling of a 9-simplex has exactly 5 vertices owned by @xmath26 and 5 by @xmath27 , this would imply the desired conclusion : there is an @xmath26-@xmath27 edge of @xmath28 with disjoint preference - labels .    call a configuration of 4 vertices in the @xmath76 cube a _ diagonal _ if each plane contains exactly one vertex .",
    "these corresponding piece selections are all mutually disjoint , and so they form a size-4 clique in @xmath81 . furthermore , any other vertex in the cube lies on exactly three planes , and so must be disjoint from one of the diagonal vertices .",
    "thus , a set of vertices that contains a diagonal is connected in @xmath81 .",
    "we now focus attention on the number of vertices of @xmath47 on each plane of the cube and their associated weights @xmath83 .",
    "consider first the case in which some plane contains only one vertex , @xmath84 ; hence @xmath85 .",
    "vertex @xmath84 is adjacent , in @xmath81 , to every other vertex with non - zero weight , since @xmath84 can not lie on a plane with any other weighted vertex ( otherwise the total weight of the plane exceeds @xmath80 ) .",
    "if there are at least five other vertices with positive weight , @xmath81 would have a connected component of size at least 6 .",
    "suppose there are five or fewer weighted vertices .",
    "since the four planes in any given direction must each contain at least one weighted vertex , there must be three planes that contain exactly one weighted vertex .",
    "these vertices each have weight @xmath80 , and each is the only vertex on any of the three orthogonal planes that contain it .",
    "therefore , any additional weighted vertex must lie in the unique intersection of the remaining planes , and this in turn implies a diagonal configuration of vertices . by our earlier argument",
    "all 10 vertices of @xmath28 are connected in @xmath81 .",
    "if there is no such plane , then every plane contains at least two vertices .",
    "we look at the possible cases individually and show that there is some vertex that lies on planes with at most 4 other vertices , and is therefore disjoint from at least 5 vertices in @xmath81 ( resulting in a connected component of size at least 6 in @xmath81 ) .",
    "we will use the shorthand notation @xmath86 to indicate the number of vertices on the 4 planes in a given direction , ordered by the number of vertices they contain .",
    "case 1 : ( 4,2,2,2 ) , ( 4,2,2,2 ) , ( 4,2,2,2 ) .",
    "suppose that in every direction there is one plane containing 4 vertices and three planes containing 2 vertices each .",
    "we claim that there exists a vertex which does not lie on any plane containing 4 vertices . to see why this is true ,",
    "let the pairs of vertices on the three 2-vertex planes in one direction be @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "the combined weight of each pair is @xmath80 .",
    "if each of these vertices appeared on a 4-vertex plane in at least one of the other two directions , the sum of the weights of those two planes would be at least the combined weight of the six vertices @xmath90 , or @xmath91 , and so at least one of the planes would have weight greater than @xmath80 , a contradiction .",
    "therefore , there is a vertex which lies only on 2-vertex planes in each direction .",
    "this vertex is not disjoint from at most 3 other vertices , and so is disjoint from at least 6 .",
    "case 2 : ( 4,2,2,2 ) , ( 4,2,2,2 ) , ( 3,3,2,2 ) . at most eight of the ten vertices of @xmath28",
    "lie on a 4-vertex plane , so at least two do not lie on 4-vertex planes .",
    "these have at most 4 neighbors in @xmath81 ( it is four if they lie on planes with 2 , 2 , and 3 vertices ) .",
    "thus , they are disjoint from at least 5 vertices in @xmath81 .",
    "case 3 : ( 4,2,2,2 ) , ( 3,3,2,2 ) , ( 3,3,2,2 ) . by an argument similar to that of case 1",
    ", there exists a vertex which does not lie on the 4-vertex plane , and lies on at most one 3-vertex plane ; otherwise , the two 3-vertex planes in each direction must contain all 6 of the vertices not on the 4-vertex plane  so the total weight of the two 3-vertex planes ( in either direction ) would be @xmath91 , which is too large . therefore , there exists a vertex that lies on at most one 3-vertex plane and no 4-vertex plane .",
    "this vertex has at most 4 neighbors in @xmath81 ( it is four if it lies on planes with 2 , 2 , and 3 vertices ) .",
    "thus it is disjoint in @xmath81 from at least 5 vertices .",
    "case 4 : ( 3,3,2,2 ) , ( 3,3,2,2 ) , ( 3,3,2,2 ) .",
    "there are twelve positions for vertices on 2-vertex planes and only 10 vertices of @xmath28 , so by the pigeonhole principle , one vertex must lie on at least two 2-vertex planes , hence it has at most 4 neighbors in @xmath81 , so it is disjoint in @xmath81 from at least 5 vertices .",
    "thus , given a fully - labeled 9-simplex @xmath28 whose image under @xmath44 contains the point @xmath74 , a uniform owner labeling produces an @xmath26-@xmath27 edge with disjoint preference - labels . by using the methods of section [ spernermethod ] we are able to find a division with disjoint envy - free piece selections for players @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    as in the proof of theorem [ thm:2cakes2p3p ] , if the cakes are cut into more than 4 pieces each , we can guarantee an envy - free allocation by restricting our attention to the case in which the extra pieces are empty .",
    "other envy - free allocations may exist as well .",
    "in this article , the polytopal sperner lemma has given us insight into how many pieces are necessary for envy - free multiple - cake division with disjoint piece selections .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to divide two ( respectively , three ) cakes among two players in an envy - free fashion with disjoint piece selections so long as each cake is cut into at least three ( respectively , four ) pieces .",
    "this suggests a natural question for 2 players and @xmath12 cakes : is it always possible to find disjoint envy - free piece selections if each cake is cut into at least @xmath92 pieces ? and can we get by with fewer pieces in some of the cakes ( as we did for 2 cakes , allowing one cake to have 2 instead of 3 pieces ) ?",
    "we have also shown that there may not exist envy - free divisions of two ( respectively , three ) cakes among two players when the cakes are only cut into two ( respectively , three ) pieces each .",
    "in fact , with preferences similar to those in the proof of theorem [ preferences ] , one can verify that 4 cakes cut in 4 pieces each is not sufficient to ensure an envy - free allocation among two players . in this case , a s preferences in order are : 4 of a kind , 3 of a kind , 2 pair , 1 pair , all different .",
    "b s preferences are the reverse . by extending these preferences to @xmath12 cakes each cut into @xmath12 pieces ,",
    "is it possible to show that disjoint envy - free piece selections may not exist for two players in this situation ?    finally , how many additional pieces do we need in each cake if there are more players who demand disjoint envy - free piece selections ?",
    "recall ( see comments at the end of section [ spernermethod ] ) that disjoint , envy - free piece selections would by nature yield pareto - optimal allocations , even with more than two players .",
    "our intuition suggests that if we cut the cake into enough pieces , we should be able to satisfy all players , though there may be many extra pieces left over .",
    "we conclude with this open question : for given numbers of players and cakes , we ask for the minimum number of pieces to divide each cake that would ensure that some division has disjoint envy - free piece selections ."
