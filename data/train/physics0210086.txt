    "laser dynamics is commonly studied considering the electric field as a scalar variable , since in most systems the polarization state is imposed by anisotropies of the cavity .",
    "for instance , brewster windows or gratings , generally used in gas lasers to close the laser tube or to select a vibro - rotational transition , impose a linearly polarized state of the laser emission .",
    "however , in perfectly cylindrical laser cavities without any elements to select a preferred polarization , the study of the dynamics includes the necessity of considering the vector nature of the electric field .",
    "several theoretical works have been devoted to the study of the polarization dynamics of the quasi - isotropic laser , showing the important role played by the material variables .",
    "in particular , the degeneracy of the angular momentum states of the laser transition sublevels has been considered as the coupling source between different polarization states .",
    "initial studies considered only stationary solutions @xcite , but more recently dynamical models have been developed to explore the role of anisotropy due to the laser medium , that from now on we will call intrinsic anisotropy @xcite .",
    "these models predict a rich dynamics even for the simplest transition , @xmath1 .",
    "later versions of these models include also linear and circular cavity anisotropies that we call extrinsic @xcite , or different level structure @xcite",
    ".    however , up to now few experiments have been performed on this subject .",
    "experiments carried out on noble gas lasers reveal that in some systems it is necessary to consider the dynamics of the matter variables to fully understand the polarization features of an isotropic system @xcite . in other cases ,",
    "the observations could be explained by a nonlinear coupling of the modes and residual cavity anisotropies @xcite .    in this work we present experimental and theoretical results for the polarization competition dynamics in the transient state of a quasi - isotropic low - pressure co@xmath0 laser .",
    "we show that the polarization dynamics during the switch - on is well described by means of a model including optical coherences ( intrinsic anisotropy ) and extrinsic linear anisotropies .",
    "these results extend our previous work in which the coherences were simplified as a parametric cross coupling between the matter polarization and electric fields @xcite , and provide a quantitative comparison between the amount of anisotropy due to the coupling of molecular angular momenta and that induced by an intracavity window .",
    "furthermore , the decay rate of the coherences , defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , is shown explicitly to be closer to the decay rate of the population inversion rather than to the decay rate of the induced polarization .",
    "the experiment has been performed using an unpolarized fabry - perot cavity as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "a total reflective flat mirror ( m@xmath2 , reflectivity r@xmath2=1 ) and an outcoupler mirror ( m@xmath0 ) with a reflectivity @xmath3 set the cavity length at @xmath475 cm . a piezo translator ( pzt ) is used to select the p(20 ) laser emission line and to adjust the laser detuning .",
    "the active medium , a mixture of @xmath5 ( 82@xmath6 ) , n@xmath0 ( 13.5@xmath6 ) and co@xmath0 ( 4.5@xmath6 ) at a pressure of 25 mbar , is pumped by a dc discharge fixed at 6.1 ma when the threshold current is 3 ma .",
    "as we are interested in the transient dynamics , an intracavity chopper is used to induce a switch - on event at a repetition rate of 200 hz .    in order to control the linear anisotropies of the cavity ,",
    "a znse anti reflection coated window ( w ) has been introduced , which can be tilted accurately as shown in fig.[setup ] .",
    "the polarization state of the laser emission has been analyzed by means of a wire grid polarizer ( pol ) , which has the property of reflecting one linear polarization of the incident radiation and transmitting the orthogonal one , with an extinction ratio of 1:180 .",
    "the reflected and transmitted parts of the beam are directed to two hgcdte fast detectors ( d@xmath2 , d@xmath0 , 100 mhz bandwidth ) , whose sensitive areas ( @xmath7 @xmath8m@xmath9 ) are much smaller than the beam size .",
    "both signals are recorded on a digital oscilloscope ( lecroy lt423l ) with @xmath10 mhz bandwidth .    in the stationary regime",
    ", we observe that the laser has two possible linear polarization directions which are orthogonal as far as we can measure . in fig .",
    "[ setup ] these cavity eigendirections are called h and v respectively .",
    "the window w can rotate by an angle @xmath11 around the axis v. when @xmath12 , the polarization direction is determined by the detuning of the cavity , as usual @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[detuning_scan](a ) , where we plot the laser intensity along both eigendirections when the detuning is varied around the line center .",
    "a residual hysteresis around the transition is masked by the limited resolution of pzt . at the transition point near the line center",
    "there is not a preferred polarization direction and the laser flips spontaneously from one to other as shown in fig .",
    "[ flipflop ] .",
    "our goal is to study the polarization behavior in this bistable region . in particular , we analyze of the switch - on transient state , in which the total intensity presents relaxation oscillations . in our system",
    "the pump strength imposes a relaxation frequency of 55 khz .",
    "when the two polarized components are separated , they show oscillations in relative antiphase , which do not appear on the total intensity ( fig.[monomode ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations depends on the angle between the polarizer axes with respect to h - v , reaching a maximum when the analysis is performed at 45@xmath13 .    in fig.[monomode](a )",
    "we report an example of these polarization oscillations , when the cavity is tuned at the center of the line .",
    "the total laser output intensity ( thick solid line ) is displayed together with its two orthogonally polarized components analyzed at 45@xmath13 ( thin solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "these oscillations are always damped until they disappear , with a damping rate depending on the cavity detuning .",
    "precisely the oscillations are more persistent the closer is the detuning to the bistable region .",
    "this fact points to the competitive origin of the oscillations . in fig.[monomode ] ( c ) we show an example of the transient dynamics when the cavity detuning is slightly moved from resonance .",
    "it is worth to note that the system is so sensible to noise that the duration of the oscillations suffers slight variations , without apparent changes in the conditions .",
    "successively , we studied the response of the system to small linear anisotropies driven by the tilt angle @xmath11 of the intracavity window w around the vertical axis .",
    "several parameters of the system are simultaneously affected by this action . as a consequence of the common increasing of the optical path for both polarization eigendirections , the line center moves with respect to the isotropic condition @xmath12 . in order to keep the bistable condition ,",
    "the cavity length is varied to recover the resonance .    in fig.[detuning_scan]((b ) and ( c ) ) we show the intensity of both polarization components for different @xmath11 values , showing that the gain profile is not significantly distorted with respect to the isotropic condition @xmath12 ( fig.[detuning_scan](a ) ) .",
    "the detuning anisotropies are measured to be smaller than 5@xmath6 of the total change .",
    "the other effect of the tilt angle @xmath11 is to increase the cavity losses . in fig.[angle ] ( b ) we report the dependence of the laser intensity on the tilt angle @xmath11 which is in agreement with the expected theoretical behavior @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the gain profiles for the two polarization directions do not change due to the tilt angle @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ detuning_scan ] ) , we can assume that the induced loss anisotropies remain a small effect ( @xmath14 ) compared to the total loss change",
    ". the effect of the losses anisotropy can be observed in the residual modulation in the total intensity ( figs.[monomode ] ( a),(c ) ) .",
    "the dynamical effect observed when @xmath11 is increased is the growing of the frequency of the polarization oscillations .",
    "measurements made near the resonance condition show that the frequency rises as the tilt angle increased(fig.[angle ] ( a ) ) .",
    "it can be seen that a tilt angle of 12@xmath13 is enough to rise the frequency from 100 khz to 400 khz .",
    "our theoretical approach is based on the theory of the isotropic laser developed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the optical coherences between upper levels are considered with the .",
    "this theory was developed for the simplest case ( j=1 @xmath15 j=0 ) , while the transition involved in our system is much more complicated ( j=19 @xmath15 j=20 ) .",
    "however , this theory has been showed to predict also the behavior of lasers with a different level structure , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . only first order coherences ( @xmath16 ) will be considered . therefore , independently of the number of sublevels",
    ", there are only two kind of possible transitions , which generate a split of the population in two ensembles , in such a way that an anisotropy is induced in the active medium @xcite .",
    "furthermore we introduce an extrinsic linear anisotropy as done in ref.@xcite .",
    "the field will be decomposed in a circularly polarized base .",
    "just losses and linear detuning anisotropies along the principal axes of the system will be included , but not circular asymmetries since our system does not show signs of dicroism .",
