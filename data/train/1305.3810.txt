    "@xcite this , in principle , opens up the possibility of using spin - related phenomena in this outstanding material with exceptional electronic properties .",
    "moreover , and indeed fortunately , graphene is not the only promising two - dimensional hexagonal system and thus many of the findings of spin - related research in graphene can also be applied to other systems . as an example we mention a monolayer of mos@xmath0@xcite which can at low energies effectively be described as two uncoupled gapped graphene systems , where both the band gap and the sois turn out to be large , @xcite and silicene , a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice made of silicon atoms.@xcite furthermore , restricting ourselves to nearest - neighbor and interlayer hopping , the hamiltonian of bilayer graphene is formally equivalent to that of monolayer graphene with a purely rashba soc , where the rashba coefficient is substituted by the interlayer hopping constant .    in recent works the effects of an external time - dependent field on two - dimensional materials such as a monolayer @xcite or bilayer@xcite of graphene , hgte / cdte quantum wells,@xcite or _ n_- and",
