    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are binary systems in which a compact object ( either a neutron star or a black hole ) accretes matter from a low - mass companion star .",
    "the neutron - star x - ray transients are a sub - group of lmxbs which spend most of their time in a quiescent state during which hardly any or no accretion onto the neutron star takes place .",
    "occasionally , huge increases in the mass - accretion rates occur making those systems very luminous ( with x - ray luminosities up to @xmath2 ergs s@xmath1 ) . in their quiescent states",
    ", neutron - star x - ray transients can still be detected with sensitive x - ray instruments at observed luminosities ( 0.510 kev ) of @xmath3  ergs s@xmath1  to a few times @xmath4 ergs s@xmath1  ( see , e.g. , van paradijs et al . 1987 ; asai et al . 1996 , 1998 ) . usually , the spectra of those systems in their quiescent states are dominated by a soft component below 1 kev which is thought to be thermal emission from the neutron - star surface due to the cooling of the neutron - star core which has been heated during the outbursts ( campana et al . 1998 ; brown , bildsten & rutledge 1998 ) . an additional power - law shaped component which dominates above a few kev might be present in the quiescent spectra . this hard component can contribute up to half of the emission in the 0.510 kev energy range ( e.g. , asai et al .",
    "1998 ; rutledge et al .",
    "however , this power - law component can not be detected in all observed quiescent neutron - star systems and the flux ratio of the power - law component to the thermal component varies considerably between sources .",
    "the origin of this hard component is not well understood but it might be due to residual accretion down to the magnetospheric radius or it may be a result of the pulsar emission mechanism being active ( e.g. , stella et al .",
    "1994 ; campana et al .",

    "they suggested that the very low luminosity of the thermal component might indicate that the neutron star in sax j1808.43658 is rather cool .",
    "such a cold neutron star suggests that enhanced cooling processes are active in its core , possibly because it is a relatively massive neutron star ( with a mass of @xmath6 m@xmath7 ; colpi et al .",
    "they also suggested that the hard spectral component possibly originates in the shock between the wind of a turned - on radio pulsar and matter outflowing from the companion star ( see also stella et al .",
    "alternatively , the quiescent x - rays could be due to direct dipole radiation from the radio pulsar ( di salvo & burderi 2003 ; burderi et al .",
    "it is still unclear why sax j1808.43658 in its quiescent state is different from the other quiescent neutron - star transients .",
    "its pulsating nature during outburst distinguishes this source from most other neutron - star transients and could be related to its unusual quiescent properties .",

    "this will clarify whether the unusual quiescent properties of sax j1808.43658 are related to its pulsating nature during outburst .",
    "in addition , observing and studying in detail as many non - pulsating neutron - star transients as possible during their quiescent state will lead to a consensus on the quiescent luminosity and spectral - shape distribution of those systems . here",
    "we report on a _ chandra _ observation of the globular cluster terzan 5 which is known to harbor the neutron - star transient exo 1745248 .",
    "our observation was taken during times when this transient was in its quiescent state .",
    "we found that during its quiescent state the source exhibited a hard x - ray spectrum similar to sax j1808.43658 although its 0.510 kev luminosity was a factor of @xmath840 higher than that of sax j1808.43658 .",
    "this is the first time that a neutron - star transient which does not exhibit pulsations during outburst is observed to exhibit the same spectral behavior as the millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.43658 in quiescence .",
    "a previous _ chandra _ observation of the globular cluster terzan 5 was performed to study the low - luminosity x - ray sources in this cluster , including the identification and study of the quiescent counterpart of exo 1745248 .",

    "due to the crowding in the image , wavdetect did not detect all sources in the center of the cluster and several sources had to be added by hand . including those sources",

    "several of the 61 detected sources are sufficiently bright to expect that they should have been detected during the outburst observation if they had been equally bright during both observations , suggesting that they are highly variable",
    ". moreover , several of the nine sources detected by heinke et al .",
    "( 2003a ) are also variable between the two observations .",
    "the analysis and discussion of those low - luminosity globular cluster sources will be reported in a forthcoming paper ( heinke et al .",
    "2004 in preparation ) .    by comparing the outburst and quiescent images , the most likely counterpart of the transient in its quiescent state can be identified ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : color_image ] right ; the arrow indicates the likely quiescent counterpart ) . using differential astrometry between the outburst and quiescent observations , we can determine whether this likely counterpart candidate is indeed exo 1745248 in its quiescent state . to do that , we calculated the coordinate offset of each source detected by heinke et al .",
    "( 2003a ) between the outburst and quiescent observations .",
    "we found an averaged offset of 0.48@xmath9 and 0.11@xmath9 for the right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "the standard deviations on these offsets are 0.13@xmath9 for the right ascension and 0.20@xmath9 for the declination .",
    "the coordinates given for exo 1745248 by heinke et al .",
    "( 2003a ) were offset by 0.48@xmath9 in right ascension and 0.19@xmath9 in declination from the ( uncorrected ) coordinates of the candidate quiescent counterpart ( indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : color_image ] , right panel ) .",
    "these offsets are well within the range of offsets measured for the other sources .    from the above",
    ", we see that the two x - ray images can be tied to each other to within @xmath80.2@xmath9 ( i.e. , the standard deviations on the offsets ) .",
    "we can now estimate the likelihood for a random source to fall within 0.2@xmath9 of the source position of exo 1745248 .",
    "we calculated this probability using the source density in one core radius of the globular cluster ( which is 7.9@xmath9 ; cohn et al .",
    "we detected 13 sources in this core radius which gives a probability of 0.8% that one of those 13 sources fall within 0.2@xmath9 of the position of exo 1745248 .",
    "we note that this probability is conservative since the source density increases toward the cluster center and exo 1745248 is located close to the edge of the core where the source density is less .",
    "moreover , the source detected on the position of exo 1745248 has unusual properties for a low - luminosity globular cluster x - ray source : it has a relatively high x - ray luminosity and hard x - ray spectrum ( see   [ section : spectral ] ) .",
    "those sources are very unusual in globular clusters and the chances for such a peculiar source ( of which there are two within the core radius of terzan 5 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : color_image ] and heinke et al .  2004 in preparation ) to fall within 0.2@xmath9 of the position of exo 1745248 is 0.12% .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this low - luminosity source is indeed the quiescent counterpart of the transient exo 1745248 and that it has peculiar characteristics in its quiescent state ( as discussed below ) .      from figure",
    "[ fig : color_image ] ( right ) it can be seen that the quiescent counterpart was not the brightest x - ray source in the cluster and that it had somewhat blueish x - ray colors indicating a reasonably hard spectrum . to quantify this",
    ", we extracted the quiescent spectrum of the source .",
    "we used the randomized data to extract the spectrum since no calibration products are available for data with the randomization removed .",
    "we used a circle with a radius of 1.5@xmath9 centered on the source position as the extraction region . owing to the crowding near the position of the transient , the standard practice of using an annulus around the source position as extraction region for the background could not be applied .",
    "therefore , as background region we used a circle with a radius of 40@xmath9 which was 1.3@xmath10 to the west of exo 1745248 but which did not contain any point sources .",
    "we used the ciao tool psextract to extract the source and background spectra and to create the response matrix and the ancillary response files ( the latter was automatically corrected for the time - variable low - energy quantum efficiency degradation ) .",
    "we grouped the spectrum in bins of 15 counts in order to validate the use of the @xmath11 fitting method and fitted the spectrum using xspec ( arnaud 1996 ; v11.3.1 ) .",
    "the source spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : spectrum ] ( a total of @xmath8250 counts were detected from exo 1745248 ; see   [ section : timing ] ) .",
    "clearly , the source is significantly detected up to at least 6 kev confirming the hardness of the spectrum .",
    "we fitted the spectrum using a variety of models .",
    "we found that a simple power - law model modified by the galactic absorption column density @xmath12 ( using phabs in xspec ; the column density was left as a free parameter in the fits ) toward terzan 5 could adequately fit the data ( reduced @xmath11 of 0.29 with 13 degrees of freedom [ d.o.f . ]",

    "we have checked our results by using different number of counts per spectral bin , by using the cash statistics ( cash 1979 ) , and by using both .",
    "the results obtained with those alternative methods were always consistent with those obtained with the @xmath11 method using 15 counts per bin ( i.e. , the fractional uncertainties obtained when calculating errors using cash statistics are very similar to those measured when using @xmath11 statistics ) . therefore , we only present the results obtained via the latter method . ] ) .",

    "normally quiescent neutron - star systems are fit with a thermal model , i.e. , a neutron - star atmosphere ( nsa ) model ( zavlin , pavlov , & shibanov 1996 , gnsick , braje , & romani 2002 ) . in those nsa models ,",

    "also did not result in an acceptable description of our spectrum ( reduced @xmath24 ; 12 d.o.f . ) furthermore , when leaving those parameters free in the fits , they could not be constrained .    leaving the normalization free and the column density as a free parameter ( but again assuming a canonical neutron star ) resulted in an acceptable fit for the nsa model from zavlin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) but with an effective temperature ( @xmath25 ) of @xmath80.6 kev ( for an observer at infinity ) and a normalization of @xmath26 .",
    "this temperature is a factor of @xmath83 larger than usually seen for quiescent neutron - star systems and the normalization implies an extremely large distance toward the source of @xmath8490 kpc .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this nsa model does not provide a good description of the data .",
    "the nsa model of gnsick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) did not allow for a good fit because the temperature soon reached the maximum allowed temperature in that model ( @xmath27 ) suggesting that also this nsa model does not describe our data .",
    "for comparison with results in the literature for other quiescent neutron - star transients , we also fit the data with a black - body model , but the resulting temperature was 1.0@xmath210.2 kev , again significantly larger than seen in any other quiescent neutron - star system ( the resulting column density was 0.6@xmath210.3 @xmath15 and the reduced @xmath11 was 0.36 with 12 d.o.f . ) .",
    "furthermore , the obtained radius of the emitting region was very small ( only 0.10@xmath210.04 km ; assuming a distance of 8.7 kpc ) also suggesting that a black - body model is not a good description of our data .",
    "several quiescent neutron - star transients have a quiescent spectrum which consists of a soft , thermal component and an additional hard component which dominates above a few kev .",
    "one can assume that exo 1745248 has a similar composite quiescent spectrum and that the relatively high column density toward terzan 5 obscures most ( if not all ) of the thermal component . to determine the flux upper limit on such a soft component we fitted the spectrum using the nsa models plus a power - law component .",
    "we again assumed a canonical neutron star and fixed the normalization in the nsa models to @xmath28 .",
    "the only free parameter of the nsa models was again the temperature .",
    "such models resulted in a best fit value for @xmath25 ( for an observer at infinity ) of @xmath29 kev with an unabsorbed 0.510 kev flux of @xmath30 ergs @xmath15 s@xmath1  for both the zavlin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and gnsick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) nsa models ( the bolometric flux was approximately twice these values ; the power - law index and column density were consistent with that obtained when fitting the data with only a power - law component ) .",
    "these upper limits on the effective temperatures are close to the temperatures observed for other quiescent neutron - star transients , however , the contribution of the thermal component to the unabsorbed 0.510 kev flux is only 5%7% . changing the normalization ( hence the distance ; we used a range between 6 and 12 kpc ) only resulted in a maximum contribution of the thermal component to the unabsorbed 0.510 kev flux of 8%10% , strongly suggesting that the quiescent spectrum of exo 1745248 is more than 90% dominated by the hard spectral component .",
    "a different way of demonstrating that the quiescent spectrum of exo 1745248 is dominated by the hard component is assuming that both the thermal and hard component contribute @xmath850% to the unabsorbed flux in the 0.510 kev energy range .",
    "we fixed the normalization of the power - law component in such a way that this component always contributed 50% to the 0.510 kev flux .",
    "this time we allowed both the temperature of the nsa models and the normalization to be free parameters during the fits ( again we assumed a canonical neutron star ) .",
    "this resulted in relatively high effective temperatures ( @xmath25 for an observer at infinity of @xmath31 kev ) but with unrealistically large distances of up to several mpc .",
    "therefore , such models do not provide a realistic description of the spectrum , suggesting again that the spectrum is dominated by the hard power - law component with only a small contribution from the thermal component .",
    "finally , we fitted the spectrum with a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum which could fit the data satisfactorily ( reduced @xmath11 of 0.24 with 12 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the column density obtained was @xmath32 @xmath15 , again very similar to the inferred column density toward terzan 5 , and the plasma temperature was 8@xmath33 kev .",

    "in figure [ fig : lc ] the count rate curve is shown using a time resolution of 2000 seconds .",

    "we note that this calculation of the predicted thermal quiescent flux is based on very limited information about the accretion history of the source .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed a simple power - law shaped spectrum of the source during outburst but it has already been shown that this is an oversimplification of the true situation ( see , e.g. , kuulkers et al . 2003 ; heinke et al .",
    "2003a ) , resulting in additional uncertainties in the predicted quiescent flux .",
    "however , in order for the standard cooling model to agree with our observations , the predicted quiescent flux must drop by a factor of 100 , meaning that the quiescent episodes between very bright outbursts ( like the 2000 and 2002 ones ) should be over a thousand years .",
    "this seems unlikely since the source has been detected on several occasions before the two latest outbursts .",
    "we prefer the point of view in which the low thermal emission from the neutron star is explained by assuming that enhanced cooling processes occur in the core , especially since strong evidence has been obtained for such processes in the neutron stars of several other quiescent systems ( e.g. , brown et al .",

    "the fact that exo 1745248 might harbor a cold neutron star may explain why the quiescent spectrum of exo 1745248 is dominated by the hard spectral component .",

    "it seems that exo 1745248 might indeed be such a system .",
    "we note that this argument assumes that the thermal and hard components are not related to each other and can therefore vary in strength independently .",
    "it also assumes that the hard component in exo 1745248 is due to the same process which causes the hard components observed in other systems .",
    "it is unclear how valid those assumptions are , mainly because of the lack of understanding of the hard x - ray emission seen in quiescent neutron - star x - ray transients .",
    "it has been suggested that this hard component might be due to residual accretion onto the surface or magnetic field of the neutron star or to the pulsar mechanism being active ( see the discussion in campana & stella 2000 ) .",
    "only limited investigations have been performed to determine exactly how those mechanisms could produce the hard emission , what exactly the spectral shape of the emission would be , and which source properties would make sources differ from each other with respect to this hard spectral component . currently only two neutron - star systems are known whose quiescent spectra are dominated by the hard spectral component : exo 1745248 and sax j1808.43658 .",

    "again it is unclear whether or not the hard components in these sources are due to the same phenomenon .",
    "however , despite this uncertainty , it is clear that hard quiescent spectra can occur at relatively high and very low luminosities and presumably also for luminosities in - between those observed for exo 1745248 and sax j1808.43658 .",
    "our results also demonstrate that it is not necessary for a source to be an accretion - driven millisecond x - ray pulsar during outburst for its quiescent spectrum to be dominated by the hard component . for exo 1745248",
    "no pulsations were seen during the outbursts indicating a different magnetic field structure ( e.g. , strength , configuration , multi - pole moments ) for the neutron star in this system than for the neutron star in sax j1808.43658 .",
    "however , several models for the hard spectral component involve a combination of the magnetic field strength and configuration , and residual accretion from the companion star , all unknown properties .",
    "this gives a large range of source properties one can vary to obtain similar quiescent spectral shapes but different outburst behavior .",
    "insight into the physical process(es ) behind the hard spectral component might come from the variability in this component observed in exo 1745248 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the hard quiescent spectra of exo 1745248 and sax j1808.43658 ( campana et al .",
    "2002 ) are very similar to the hard quiescent spectra observed for the quiescent black - hole x - ray transients ( see kong et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "it is not clear if the hard spectral component is caused by the same physical process(es ) in the quiescent neutron - star transients as in the quiescent black - hole systems , but if they are then any models involving a neutron - star surface or magnetic field or a black - hole event horizon are not valid . irrespective of whether or not the same physical mechanism(s ) is behind the hard quiescent spectra of exo 1745248 and sax j1808.43658 and the black - hole systems , our results and those of campana et al .",
    "( 2002 ) demonstrate that not all the neutron - star systems are different in quiescence from the black - hole systems .",
    "rutledge et al . (",
    "2000 ) suggested that these differences could be used to determine the nature of the compact object in an x - ray binary for which this was not yet known .",
    "however , our results and those of campana et al .",
    "( 2002 ) now show that a hard spectral shape in quiescence does not mean that the compact object in a particular x - ray transient is a black hole ( note that on average , the neutron - star systems could still be different from the black - hole systems , but one particular neutron - star binary might not be ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the faintness of several of the black - hole systems might still be a property potentially exclusive to those systems and might be used to determine the black - hole nature of certain transients .",
    "unfortunately , several quiescent black - hole systems have quiescent luminosities in the range seen for sax j1808.43658 and exo 1745248 , making this possible method of distinguishing between the different types of transients only useful for those black - hole systems which can become very faint in quiescence .",
    "if the quiescent spectrum of a particular transient is dominated by a soft thermal component , it is still likely that this system harbors a neutron - star primary since no black - hole system has shown a thermal component in its quiescent x - ray spectrum .",
    "based on the outburst spectrum of exo 1745248 , heinke et al .",
    "( 2003a ) suggested that exo 1745248 might be in an ultra - compact binary with a binary period @xmath54 1 hour .",
    "the 2-hr binary period of sax j1808.43658 ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) shows that this system is in a compact binary system .",
    "if the compact binary nature of exo 1745248 can be confirmed , this would tentatively indicate that the compact binary nature of this source and sax j1808.43658 might be related to their hard spectra in their quiescent states . however , currently not enough information is available to arrive at any definite conclusions .",
    "more information will be available in the next few years after more ( ultra-)compact neutron - star binaries have been observed and studied in quiescence ( such as xte j1751305 , xte j0929 - 314 , and xte j1807294 which are currently scheduled to be observed with _",

    "[ [ implication - for - the - classification - of - low - luminosity - globular - cluster - sources ] ] implication for the classification of low - luminosity globular cluster sources ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the fact that exo 1745248 and sax j1808.43658 have hard quiescent spectra may have consequences for our understanding of the nature of the low - luminosity globular cluster x - ray sources . when optical and radio identifications are not available for those sources , they are often given tentative classifications on the basis of their x - ray luminosities and the hardness of their spectra ( e.g. , grindlay et al .",
    "2001a , b ; pooley et al .",
    "2002a , b ; gendre , barret , & web 2003 ; heinke et al .",
    "those sources which have luminosities above @xmath55 ergs s@xmath1  and are soft are generally classified as quiescent neutron - stars systems ; those which are relatively bright ( up to around @xmath4 ergs s@xmath1 ) and have hard spectra are generally classified as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "the sources below @xmath56 ergs s@xmath1  could be a variety of objects , including cvs , millisecond radio pulsars or active binaries ( e.g. , by dra or rs cvn systems ) .",
    "usually a x - ray color - magnitude diagram is created and different branches are identified corresponding to different source types . to investigate the impact of the hard spectrum of exo 1745248 on such a diagram we create a similar diagram for terzan 5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) . clearly , the quiescent transient ( labeled transient ) is one of the brightest sources and its color is quite hard .",
    "the sources which are identified by the numbers 2 , 3 , 4 , and 8 ( using the numbering of heinke et al .",
    "2003a ) are considerably softer and would likely be classified as quiescent neutron - star systems if no additional information were available .",
    "indeed heinke et al .",
    "( 2003a ) classified them as such and they suggested that the sources to the left of them were good cv candidates . without prior knowledge of the nature of exo 1745248 , its hard color would have suggested it to be a cv , but this is far from a clear - cut classification .",
    "moreover , when candidate cvs have enough counts to extract their x - ray spectra , those spectra are usually fit with a thermal bremsstrahlung model with a plasma temperature of @xmath57 5 kev . as shown in ",
    "[ section : spectral ] , the quiescent spectrum of exo 1745248 could also be adequately fitted with such a spectral model and the resulting plasma temperature is fully consistent with what has been observed from cvs .",
    "the only unusual aspect of exo 1745248 would be its rather high x - ray luminosity of @xmath58 ergs s@xmath1 , which would not be fully consistent with a cv nature .",
    "likely , the source would then have been classified as an unusually bright cv , but a potential quiescent neutron - star transient with a very unusual spectrum might also have been suggested .",
    "this possible misclassification strongly suggests that some of the hard sources in the globular cluster studies might have been misclassified as cvs but are in reality quiescent neutron - star systems .",
    "this conclusion is further strengthened by the quiescent properties of sax j1808.43658 ( campana et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this source had a similar hard quiescent spectrum but a @xmath840 times lower x - ray luminosity bringing this source right in the range of luminosity expected for cvs .",
    "it is very likely that if sax j1808.43658 had been located in a globular cluster and the neutron - star nature of its primary was not known from additional information ( like its outbursts and pulsations ) , then this source would have been classified on the basis of its quiescent x - ray properties as a cv ( see also the discussion in wijnands et al .",
    "we see no reason why future discovered quiescent neutron - star systems would not exhibit similarly hard spectral shapes and have x - ray luminosities in - between what we observe for exo 1745248 and sax j1808.43658 .",
    "if true , then this group of sources would have very similar x - ray characteristics to those of cvs and this must be taken into account during the classification of low - luminosity x - ray sources in globular clusters when this is done solely on the basis of their x - ray properties .",
    "we searched the literature and found eleven detections of quiescent neutron - star systems for which spectra of sufficient quality could be obtained to investigate their quiescent spectra .",
    "we only discuss those systems which are confirmed neutron - star x - ray transients as they have been seen to exhibit type - i x - ray bursts and/or x - ray pulsations . out of those eleven sources ,",
    "nine were dominated by the thermal component and two were dominated by the hard component .",
    "this suggests that out of every eleven quiescent neutron - star systems two such systems could have hard quiescent spectra , which is a non - negligible fraction of the total .",
    "therefore , a similar fraction of hard quiescent neutron - star transients might be present in globular clusters which are currently missed because they are incorrectly classified .",
    "we note that this is a very rough estimate mainly because of the very few systems known ( especially those with a hard quiescent spectrum ) .",
    "this estimate assumes that most accreting neutron - star systems are similar to those that have been detected in outburst .",
