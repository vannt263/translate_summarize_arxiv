    "for non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians it has been established that the physical requirements of spectral positivity and unitarity can be met even though the hamiltonian is not hermitian in the dirac sense .",
    "( a hamiltonian @xmath4 is hermitian in the _ dirac sense _ if it satisfies @xmath7 , where the dirac adjoint - symbol @xmath8 indicates combined complex conjugation and matrix transposition . )",
    "many @xmath0-symmetric model hamiltonians have been studied @xcite , but the first non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian for which spectral positivity and unitarity were verified is @xmath9    it was shown in 1998 that the spectrum of the class of hamiltonians ( [ e1 ] ) was positive and discrete @xcite and it was conjectured that spectral positivity was a consequence of the invariance of @xmath4 under the combination of the space - reflection operator @xmath10 and the time - reversal operator @xmath11 .",
    "three years later , a rigorous proof of spectral positivity was given @xcite .",
    "then , in 2002 it was demonstrated that the time - evolution operator @xmath12 for the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) is unitary @xcite . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that if the @xmath0 symmetry of a non - hermitian hamiltonian is unbroken , then it is possible to construct a new operator called @xmath5 that commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "the hilbert - space inner product with respect to the @xmath13 adjoint has a positive norm . also , the operator @xmath14 is unitary with respect to the @xmath13 adjoint .",
    "thus , dirac hermiticity of the hamiltonian is not a necessary requirement of a quantum theory and unbroken @xmath0 symmetry is sufficient to guarantee that the spectrum of @xmath4 is real and positive and that the time evolution is unitary .    in subsequent papers",
    "the @xmath5 operators for various quantum - mechanical and field - theoretic models were calculated @xcite , mostly by using conventional perturbative methods .",
    "it was shown that this operator has a natural form as the parity operator multiplied by an exponential of a dirac hermitian operator @xmath15 : @xmath16 the operator @xmath15 vanishes in the unperturbed @xmath17 limit when the hamiltonian becomes hermitian and parity invariant .",
    "this implies that the @xmath5 operator can be interpreted as the complex extension of the parity operator @xmath10 .",
    "it was proved by mostafazadeh that the @xmath15 operator can be used to transform the non - dirac - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath4 to a spectrally equivalent dirac - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath6 @xcite : @xmath18 this similarity transformation was used by geyer _",

    "originally , bender and boettcher introduced the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) to examine the conjecture by bessis and zinn - justin that the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath19 might be real .",
    "bender and boettcher speculated that if this conjecture were true , then the reality of the spectrum might be due to the obvious symmetry of this hamiltonian under combined @xmath10 and @xmath11 reflection . to study this conjecture bender and",
    "boettcher considered the hamiltonian in ( [ e1 ] ) because ( i ) this hamiltonian is @xmath0 symmetric for all real @xmath3 , and ( ii ) it could then be studied perturbatively for small @xmath3 by using the methods of the @xmath20 expansion , which had been developed much earlier by bender _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "( one recovers the bessis - zinn - justin model hamiltonian by setting @xmath21 . )",
    "the discovery that order - by - order in powers of @xmath3 the eigenvalues of @xmath4 in ( [ e1 ] ) are _ all _ real led to much subsequent numerical and analytical work on this model .",
    "surprisingly , the methods of the @xmath20 expansion , for which the principal idea is to introduce in the _ exponent _ a small perturbation parameter whose effect is to quantify how nonlinear a theory is , was not used in further studies of the hamiltonian in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the objective of this paper is to report a new perturbative study along these lines in which the @xmath5 operator and the equivalent dirac - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath6 are calculated for small @xmath3 .",
    "we have determined the @xmath5 operator to first order in powers of @xmath3 , and using this result we have found the equivalent hermitian hamiltonian @xmath6 to second order in @xmath3 .",
    "the results can be presented compactly , but they reveal in dramatic fashion how complicated and nonlocal the isospectral dirac hermitian hamiltonian @xmath6 can be .    the construction of the @xmath5 operator in ref .",
    "@xcite was the key step in showing that time evolution for the non - hermitian hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) is unitary .",

    "[ s4 ] we discuss the calculation of eigenvalues .",
    "we begin our calculation of the @xmath5 operator for @xmath4 in ( [ e1 ] ) by expanding @xmath4 to second - order in powers of @xmath3 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ^ 2 $ ] .",

    "we will see that even-@xmath35 terms as well as odd-@xmath35 terms must be included in ( [ e8 ] ) .",
