    "after their injection these `` hot '' electrons move at first ballistically with well - defined , high kinetic energy before they relax in an otherwise degenerate fermi liquid    interested in the case of a high mobility 2des since here electrons near the fermi edge have a momentum mean - free path @xmath1 of several micrometers and therefore move ballistically through the mesoscopic device .",
    "the scattering length of the hot electrons , however , at first strongly decreases as a function of kinetic energy as the phase space for scattering processes grows . for larger kinetic energies the electron - electron scattering length increases again because of the high velocity and short interaction times .    in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the 2des , the lorentz force tends to guide hot electrons to move along the edges of the conducting mesa of the 2des . in this article",

    "one - dimensional '' refers to a situation where the lateral width of the effective transport channel still exceeds the magnetic length .",
    "relevant energy - loss mechanisms of hot electrons in a 2des are the emission of plasmons , acoustic or optical phonons , or scattering with `` cold '' equilibrium electrons in the degenerate fermi sea .",
    "the radiation of photons is strongly suppressed because of the momentum missmatch .",
    "the emission of plasmons by hot electrons is particularly hard to capture in pure transport experiments so we will address plasmons only briefly from the theoretical point of view in this article .",

    "it therefore wo nt be a focus here , but detailed investigations in zero magnetic field have already been conducted on comparable samples by using a novel phonon spectroscopy technique.@xcite it is worth mentioning , however , that acoustic phonons play a major role in interactions between _ electrically separated _ nanostructures in nonequilibrium without@xcite and with@xcite a perpendicular magnetic field applied .    the emission of optical phonons has been studied in zero magnetic field in various types of experiments since the 1960 s .",
    "it usually shows up as a very weak oscillatory signal as a function of the kinetic energy of hot electrons , with an oscillation frequency equal to the phonon energy .",

    "these two processes dominate the scattering dynamics of hot electrons in a degenerate two- or one - dimensional electron system in the whole range of available magnetic fields . at low fields",
    "hot electrons relax mainly via electron - electron scattering while the emission of optical phonons becomes more and more important at high fields .",
    "still , amplification of the injected electron current based on electron - electron scattering occurs even in a large perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "our measurements indicate that the scattering time between hot electrons and optical phonons strongly decreases as a function of the perpendicular magnetic field while the electron - electron scattering time increases .",
    "our experimental results are backed up by numerical calculations of the electron - electron scattering time and the emission rate of optical phonons as a function of the perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "finally , changing the magnetic field direction reveals a contribution of hopping transport via high energy localized bulk states of the 2des where a strong perpendicular magnetic field hinders the screening of disorder .",

    "note that the exact nature of the emitter is not important in the experiments shown here ( similar measurements with a broad barrier as emitter yield comparable results ) .",
    "the sample was measured in a @xmath8he cryostat at an electron temperature of @xmath9mk .    unless stated",

    "could the observed change in the amplification effect then be related to a transition of scattering of hot electrons in two dimensions to one - dimensional scattering at finite @xmath54 ?",
    "a first answer to this question can be given by a comparison of the screening length @xmath89 nm of the 2des at @xmath71 with the width of the current - carrying channel at @xmath69 t , approximately given by the cyclotron radius in the quantum hall regime . at @xmath69 t",

    "the area occupied by 2des between be and bc measures slightly more than a square micrometer and therefore contais about 3000 electrons .",
    "the potential in this area is increased in a regime of avalanche amplification by up to @xmath95mv ( see ref .   for details on the setup used to obtain this number ) which corresponds to a reduction of the resident electrons by roughly 10% . in the following",

    "a hot electron can travel from be to bc by a combination of energy relaxation and hopping between these localized states .",
    "our experimental observations are consistent with the assumption that in a large magnetic field a small part of the overall current is carried by such a hopping transport mechanism .",
    "finally , we observe that the amplitude of the phonon - induced oscillations decays faster as the energy @xmath72  is increased for @xmath223 compared to @xmath110 . this behavior might be related to the transport via localized states but will not be discussed in detail here .",
    "in conclusion we have studied the energy relaxation of hot electrons injected at an energy @xmath66 into an otherwise degenerate 2des .",
    "the transport measurements have been performed in a mesoscopic three - terminal device in which two of the contacts ( emitter and collector ) are separated by tunable electrostatic barriers .",
    "the emitter current and the energy of the injected electrons are fully controlled while the currents into the other two contacts are measured .",
    "our main observation is that as a function of a perpendicular magnetic field the electron - electron scattering rate decreases while the emission of optical phonons increases drastically .",
    "quantitatively , the corresponding electron - phonon relaxation time declines from over 2ps at zero magnetic field to below 0.2ps at strong perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "numerical calculations within the theoretical standard approaches quantitatively confirm our data and support the following interpretation of our experiments .",
    "we have observed the transition from two - dimensional scattering of hot electrons at zero magnetic field towards one - dimensional dynamics at large perpendicular magnetic fields . in the quasi ",
    "one - dimensional limit the interaction of hot electrons with optical phonons becomes so strong that we clearly observe the emission of more than 10 optical phonons by individual hot electrons in the current signals .",
    "this allows us to determine the onset energy of lo phonons in gaas at @xmath262mk with high precision to @xmath0mev .",
    "finally , measurements as a function of the direction of a strong perpendicular magnetic field suggest that the expected flow of the hot electrons along the mesa edges is accompanied by a second transport contribution which we interpret as hot electrons hopping between localized bulk states of the 2des",

    "this curve shape can be interpreted as an ohmic contribution to @xmath10  ( which is proportional to @xmath12  and is determined by the ohmic resistances of the three - terminal device ) plus a negative contribution that saturates at @xmath271a .",
    "the saturation of the negative contribution to @xmath10  is explained by taking into account the neutralization of electron - hole pairs created by electron - electron scattering .",
    "the generation rate of the electron - hole pairs should be roughly proportional to the number of injected electrons , so neutralization becomes more efficient at larger @xmath12 .",
    "this is related to the positive charge building up between be and bc due to the amplification effect which hinders the escape of hot electrons via bc . since electrons that can not escape",
    "add to the neutralization of holes a steady state is reached in which the negative contibution to @xmath10saturates.@xcite    the ohmic contribution of @xmath10  proportional to @xmath12  is straightforward to explain . at energies at which the electron - electron scattering length @xmath36  is small , multiple scattering processes result in many electrons with small kinetic energies and almost arbitrary direction of their momentum .",

    "[ current_line](c ) has a differently scaled y - axis .",
    "the preferred directional motion along the edges of the hall bar at @xmath265 t prevents ohmic contributions even at large currents .",
    "this explains part of the more complex behavior seen for low energies @xmath268mev in fig.[current_line](c ) at @xmath265 t , namely that the bunching of curves @xmath10(@xmath12 ) for several energies at high @xmath12  is missing .",
    "in addition , in a large positive magnetic field the minimum of @xmath10  strongly shifts as a function of energy and @xmath23 persists to larger @xmath12  and larger energies @xmath72  compared to @xmath71 [ compare figs .",
