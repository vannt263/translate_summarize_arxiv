    "this theory has been used in a detailed analysis of two - hole states bound by one - magnon exchange @xcite as well as of spiral phases @xcite .",
    "the systematic effective field theory investigations have also been extended to electron - doped antiferromagnets @xcite . in that case ,",
    "no shraiman - siggia - type term ( with just a single spatial derivative ) exists .",
    "hence at low energies magnon - electron couplings are weaker than magnon - hole couplings . as a consequence ,",

    "we assume that the hubbard model and the @xmath0-@xmath1-model are reliable models to describe doped quantum antiferromagnets , and therefore are valid as concrete microscopic models for the low - energy effective field theory for magnons and holes . due to the fact that the effective lagrangian to be constructed must inherit all symmetries of the underlying microscopic systems , a careful symmetry analysis of these microscopic models is presented in this section .",
