    "strange - modes are one type of stellar pulsation modes , but have significantly different properties from those of ordinary modes appearing in most of pulsating stars .",
    "although their physical properties have not been well established yet , they have been examined by many authors so far .",
    "@xcite found strange - modes for the first time in a numerical study for luminous helium stars .",
    "he pointed out that there is no one - to - one correspondence between solutions by adiabatic and nonadiabatic analyses .",
    "as a matter of fact , they were not called strange - modes at that time , but @xcite named them `` strange '' modes for the first time in the study of pulsations in hydrogen deficit carbon stars . @xcite",
    "systematically analyzed radial and nonradial pulsations in models with different @xmath4 ratios , and found that strange - modes appear in models with @xmath5 .",
    "they also investigated the origin of strange - modes with a numerical experiment , in which they artificially changed the thermal time - scale .",
    "for the thermal time - scale reduced to zero , which generates an extremely nonadiabatic situation , the strange - mode eigenfrequencies are close to those obtained by a fully nonadiabatic analysis with the realistic and unchanged thermal time - scale . on the other hand , when increasing the thermal time - scale and generating an adiabatic situation , the real part of eigenfrequency decreases toward zero while the imaginary part remains large .",
    "and then the mode becomes an oscillatory convection ( @xmath6 ) mode .",
    "@xcite performed a similar experiment , and found a relation to thermal waves .",
    "@xcite found strange - modes not related to thermal waves both in a fully nonadiabatic analysis and in the nonadiabatic reversible ( nar ) approximation ( equivalent with reducing the thermal time - scale to zero in s experiment ) . in the nar approximation ,",
    "the classical @xmath1-mechanism can no longer work , and hence an alternative physical explanation for the excitation of the strange - modes has been needed . to understand about the instability of this type of strange - mode , which is called `` strange - mode instability '' , @xcite suggested with a local analysis that dominance of radiation pressure leads to a large phase lag between density and pressure perturbations , and to the strange - mode instability .",
    "@xcite also carried out analytic investigations through different approaches , and obtained similar consequences .",
    "but in addition to this , they claimed that the opacity derivative with respect to density @xmath7 is essential for the instability , and that the instability grows as radiation pressure gradient produces a restoring force .",
    "since the strange - modes mentioned above appear in the environment with short thermal time - scale , the adiabatic approximation is no longer available for them .",
    "however , after new opacity tables @xcite were released , strange modal sequences have been found even by adiabatic analyses in a modal diagram , i.e. a diagram plotting frequencies as a function of a stellar parameter ( e.g. mass , effective temperature ) .",
    "modes on such sequences appear since the fe opacity bump , enhanced in the new opacity tables , causes a sound speed inversion . as a result",
    ", mode amplitude is confined around there , and the @xmath1-mechanism works efficiently and leads to an extremely rapid growth of amplitude ( kiriakidis et al . ;",
    "saio et al . ) .",
    "although the physical properties still remain puzzling , unstable strange - modes have been found in models of very luminous stars such as massive stars , wolf - rayet stars , helium stars , etc . by many studies ( summarized by saio et al . ) .",
    "growth time - scales of unstable strange - modes are likely to be much shorter than those of ordinary modes , and comparable to their pulsational periods .",
    "then , instability of the strange - modes might lead to nonlinear phenomena such as mass loss , and might be influential on stellar evolution .",
    "indeed , the instability of strange - modes has been suggested as one of the candidates for a trigger of the ( hd , 1979 ) limit phenomenon . in the hertzsprung - russel ( hr ) diagram , there are few observed stars over the hd limit .",
    "this implies that stars with @xmath8 can not evolve toward red supergiants . just in the lower left side of the hd limit",
    ", luminous blue variables [ lbvs or s dor ( sd ) variables ] are distributed .",
    "they intermittently show irregular variations in visible magnitude in a timescale of years to decades , while their bolometric magnitude almost keeps constant . in the hr diagram , this phenomenon can be shown as a horizontal transition . as an explanation for this , it is thought that sporadic eruptions would take place by some mechanism , and generate a thick envelope with a pseudo - photosphere .",
    "as the envelope expands , the apparent effective temperature decreases .",
    "when the eruptions cease , the core would be exposed again , and the effective temperature goes back to the original high value . after repeating this process and losing substantial mass ,",
    "the stars are thought to evolve toward wolf - rayet stars .",
    "although the mass - loss mechanism of lbvs has not been established yet , kiriakidis , fricke & glatzel ( ) found that strange - modes are unstable around the hd limit , and suggested that their instability could be responsible for the hd limit phenomenon .",
    "recently , nonlinear calculations for radial strange - modes have been carried out ( @xcite ; chernigovski et al . ; grott et al . ) to investigate pulsationally - driven mass - loss , although there seem to be no conclusive results so far . on the other hand , @xcite observed a pulsation in a luminous b star , hd 50064 , and found that its mass - loss rate changes in a time - scale of the pulsation period .",
    "@xcite suggested that a strange - mode could be a candidate for this pulsation in terms of the period .",
    "stability of strange - modes has been so far investigated by nonadiabatic analyses with frozen - in convection ( fc ) approximation . indeed",
    ", convection theories still have a lot of uncertainties .",
    "moreover , convective energy transport in the envelopes of hot massive stars is not so dominant as that of stars in the redder side of the classical instability strip .",
    "however , around the fe opacity bump , convective luminosity occupies a few dozen percent of luminosity .",
    "therefore , we can not definitively conclude that convection never affects pulsations .",
    "note that @xcite performed nonadiabatic analyses by two types of fc with zero lagrangian and eulerian perturbations of convective luminosity , and obtained significantly different results between the two types of fc .    in this study",
    ", we carry out a nonadiabatic analysis of the strange - modes in hot massive stars with time - dependent convection ( tdc ) . despite uncertainties of convection theories ,",
    "nonadiabatic analyses with tdc have been able to roughly explain suppression of pulsational instability in the redder side of the classical instability strip @xcite .",
    "convection in the redder side of the strip is caused by the h and the he opacity bumps .",
    "in hot massive stars , on the other hand , the fe bump generates a convection zone with a certain contribution of convective luminosity .",
    "pulsations in massive stars are then worthy to analyze with tdc .",
    "we construct evolutionary models of massive stars with modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa , , ) .",
    "the mixing length parameter is set to @xmath9 .",
    "no mass loss is taken into account .",
    "the atmosphere part is constructed by following the eddington - grey recipe suggested by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the heavy element abundance ratios of @xcite to evaluate opacity .",
    "we carry out a stability analysis of radial pulsations with the nonadiabatic code developed by @xcite . in this study ,",
    "perturbation of nuclear energy generation rate @xmath10 is neglected .",
    "the outer boundary conditions are imposed at @xmath11 .",
    "we adopt the tdc formulation originally derived by @xcite .",
    "this theory has been further developed by ( , ) and ( , , , ) .",
    "recently , @xcite independently implemented this theory into a nonadiabatic code , with which @xcite succeeded in explaining the suppression of the pulsational instability of @xmath12 scuti in the redder side of the classical instability strip . in this study ,",
    "the perturbation of the convective flux is taken into account , while the effect of the reynolds stress tensor perturbation is neglected .",
    "we set the parameter for this tdc theory to @xmath13 following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is still uncertain about how to deal with this parameter .",
    "the result of the stability is slightly dependent on the value of @xmath14 .",
    "if we adopt different values for the parameter @xmath14 , stability ( or instability ) of modes with small growth or damping rates changes to some extent , but the results for those with large rates do not change significantly .",

    "we can see that there is a corresponding sequence of adiabatic solutions to each sequence of the nonadiabatic solutions .    as the stellar mass increases , however , the sequences become waving , and come to cross each other complicatedly . for massive stars ,",
    "there are ascending sequences like ones labeled as a1 and a2 , and descending sequences like ones as d1 , d2 and d3 in modal diagrams as shown in the right panels of figure [ fig : modal_pop1 ] .",
    "the ascending and the descending ones correspond to ordinary modes and strange - modes , respectively . in the right panels",

    "this causes appearance of eigenmodes which can not be explained by the adiabatic approximation .",

    "although the previous studies have adopted the fc approximation , the present study revealed that the instability certainly appears even with taking into account effects of convection .",
    "although we carry out a linear analysis in this study , a nonlinear analysis is required to know if the instability can indeed induce the mass eruptions .",

    "we carry out a nonadiabatic analysis of strange - modes with tdc for hot massive stars . compared with results by fc ,",
    "the instability is weaker for modes excited at the fe bump .",

    "<S> we carry out a nonadiabatic analysis of strange - modes in hot massive stars with time - dependent convection ( tdc ) . in envelopes of such stars , </S>",
    "<S> convective luminosity is not so dominant as that in envelopes of stars in the redder side of the classical instability strip . around the fe opacity bump </S>",
    "<S> , however , convection contributes non - negligibly to energy transfer . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that instability of modes excited at the fe bump is likely to be weaker with tdc compared with the case of adopting the frozen - in convection approximation . </S>",
    "<S> but we confirm that unstable strange - modes certainly remain in hot massive stars even by taking into account tdc . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine properties of the strange - mode instability , which is related to destabilization of strange - modes without adiabatic counterparts . in this type of instability , </S>",
    "<S> the phase lag between density and pressure varies from 0 to @xmath0 in an excitation zone unlike the case of the @xmath1-mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we confirm by comparing models with @xmath2 and @xmath3 that dominance of radiation pressure is important for this type of instability . </S>"
