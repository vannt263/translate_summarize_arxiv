    "chemotaxis , the directed movement of cells in response to chemical gradients , plays an important role in many biological fields , such as embryogenesis , immunology , cancer growth , and wound healing @xcite . at the macroscopic level ,",
    "chemotaxis models can be formulated in terms of the cell density @xmath0 and the concentration of the chemical signal @xmath1 .",
    "a classical model to describe the time evolution of these two variables is the ( patlak- ) keller - segel system , suggested by patlak in 1953 @xcite and keller and segel in 1970 @xcite . assuming that the time scale of the chemical signal is much larger than that of the cell movement , the classical parabolic - elliptic keller - segel equations read as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a bounded domain or @xmath4 , with homogeneous neumann boundary and initial conditions .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is the secretion rate at which the chemical substance is emitted by the cells .",
    "the nonlinear term @xmath6 models the cell movement towards higher concentrations of the chemical signal .",
    "this model exhibits the phenomenon of cell aggregation .",
    "the more cells are aggregated , the more the attracting chemical signal is produced by the cells .",
    "this process is counterbalanced by cell diffusion , but if the cell density is sufficiently large , the nonlocal chemical interaction dominates diffusion and results in a blow - up of the cell density . in two space dimensions , the critical threshold for blow - up",
    "is given by @xmath7 if @xmath8 is a bounded connected domain with @xmath9 boundary @xcite and @xmath10 in the radial and whole - space case @xcite .",

    "a global whole - space solution exists , which becomes unbounded as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exist radially symmetric initial data such that , in the supercritical case , the solution forms a @xmath12-singularity in finite time @xcite .    motivated by numerical and modeling issues , the question how blow up can be avoided has been investigated intensively the last years .",
    "it has been suggested to modify the chemotactic sensitivity ( modeling , e.g. , volume - filling effects ) , to allow for degenerate cell diffusion , or to include suitable growth - death terms .",
    "we refer to @xcite for references .",
    "another idea is to introduce additional cell diffusion in the equation for the chemical concentration @xcite .",
    "this diffusion term avoids , even for arbitrarily small diffusion constants , the blow - up and leads to the global - in - time existence of weak solutions @xcite .",
    "the model , which is investigated in this paper , reads as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the additional diffusion constant .",
    "we impose the homogeneous neumann boundary and initial conditions @xmath15 the advantage of the additional diffusion term is that blow - up of solutions is translated to large gradients which may help to determine the blow - up time numerically .",
    "another advantage is that the enlarged system exhibits an interesting entropy structure ( see below ) .    at first sight",
    ", the additional term @xmath16 seems to complicate the mathematical analysis .",
    "indeed , the resulting diffusion matrix of the system is neither symmetric nor positive definite , and we can not apply the maximum principle to the equation for the chemical signal anymore . it was shown in @xcite that all these difficulties can be resolved by the observation that the above system possesses a logarithmic entropy , @xmath17 which is dissipated according to @xmath18 suitable gagliardo - nirenberg inequalities applied to the right - hand side lead to gradient estimates for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which are the starting point for the global existence and long - time analysis .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at developing a finite volume scheme which preserves the entropy structure on the discrete level by generalizing the scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we are able to prove the existence of discrete solutions and their numerical convergence to the continuous solution for all values of the initial mass . moreover , we show that the discrete solution converges for large times to the homogeneous steady state if @xmath21 or @xmath22 are sufficiently small , using a new discrete logarithmic sobolev inequality ( proposition [ prop.dlsi ] ) .    in the literature",

    "also a dynamic moving - mesh method @xcite , a variational steepest descent approximation scheme @xcite , and a stochastic particle approximation @xcite were developed . concerning numerical schemes for the parabolic - parabolic model ( in which @xmath23 is added to the second equation in ) , we mention the second - order central - upwind finite volume method of @xcite , the discontinuous finite element approach of @xcite , and the conservative finite element scheme of @xcite .",
