    "the lines observed in this study are also optically thin and have similar upper energy states , and thus their intensities vary with @xmath35 in step with c@xmath5o , providing at least partial compensation for changing physical conditions .",
    "moreover , c@xmath5o(1 - 0 ) has a higher critical density ( @xmath45 @xmath9 ) than the optically thick co , and should have more similar beam filling factors to the lines presented here . if the highest critical density species are strongly subthermal abundances may be somewhat overestimated . on the other hand , for these same high critical density species",
    ", it is expected that their emission will be more confined than c@xmath5o and hence underestimated locally .",

    "each pixel in each map is treated as a separate datapoint in an @xmath90 dimensional space , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the number of pixels along the corresponding axis of the maps , and @xmath93 is the number of maps included .",

    "c@xmath5o , n@xmath12h@xmath7 , hcn and hnc have large projections onto pc1 , but small projections onto pc2 and pc3 ( and the pc2 and pc3 projections of c@xmath5o and hnc have opposite signs ) . since hnc is expected to trace the distribution of dense quiescent gas and c@xmath5o the column density , it would appear that pc1 represents the density - weighted average column density map of ic 342 .",
    "this also agrees with the general appearance of pc1 .",
    "in fact the pc1 map is basically an average of the c@xmath5o and hnc maps .",

    "hnc , another molecule with a large pc1 projection , is the molecule most closely correlated with the 3 mm continuum . of all of the detected transitions , hnc has the highest critical density , and is most heavily weighted toward regions of high density , and not just high column density .",

    "pc3 distinguishes between gmc c ( particularly between upstream [ @xmath27co and c@xmath1s ] and downstream [ hc@xmath6n and 3 mm ] species ) and between gmcs c and d. pc3 thus hints at being connected with the distribution of massive star formation .",
    "the large variations in spatial morphology observed for the different molecules across the central half kiloparsec of ic 342 are caused by either differences in emissivity ( excitation ) or abundances ( chemistry ) . in this section",
    "we discuss the possible influences on the molecular emission that could lead to the observed variations .",
    "the molecules of our sample have lower opacities , higher critical densities , and larger partition functions than co , and so these lines are more sensitive to changes in excitation due to variations in density that can affect emissitivity .",
    "since we already know a fair amount about cloud conditions in ic 342 from the ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) lines of the co isotopomers , we can investigate how important excitation is to the emissivities of these molecules .",
    "all of the detected lines have similar upper level energies and thus behave similarly to changes in excitation temperature , @xmath35 ( see table [ molp ] ) .",
    "significant variations in @xmath35 as traced by c@xmath5o are not seen , with a range of temperatures across the nucleus of 7 - 15 k , except for a small region towards the starburst ( gmc b ) .",
    "since the excitation properties are similar and most of the gas is at a relatively uniform excitation temperature anyway , @xmath35 is not the major cause of the spatial differences between the molecules .",
    "critical density can also play a role in emissivity .",
    "the range of electric dipole moments for the observed species of @xmath97 = 0.8 ( c@xmath12h ) - 3.73 ( hc@xmath6n ) , corresponds to a factor of @xmath1020 in critical density ( @xmath981000 if one counts co ) .",
    "the co isotopomers indicate that volume densities of the gmcs are @xmath99 @xmath9 ( @xcite ) . at this density ,",
    "transitions with the highest critical density should have the most limited extent .",
    "however , we find that there are extended and confined species at both lower critical densities ( ch@xmath6oh vs. c@xmath12h ) , intermediate critical densities ( hnco vs. c@xmath1s ) as well as the highest critical densities ( n@xmath12h@xmath7 vs. hc@xmath6n ) .",
    "we conclude that densities in the gmcs are @xmath100 @xmath9 , high enough to ( at least partially ) excite all of the molecules everywhere across the nucleus , except perhaps hc@xmath6n and n@xmath12h@xmath7 , which have the very highest critical densities .",
    "although variations in density and temperature are not the primary forces determining the appearance of the maps of figure 2 , there may be regions where they play a role .",
    "gmc a is genuinely different from the other gmcs , in spite of its similarity in co and hcn .",
    "the first hints that gmc a was different came from the temperature map made using c@xmath5o ( @xcite ) .",
    "gmc a is a localized ` hot spot ' , with @xmath101 15 k , higher than the 10 k we adopt here .",
    "the species with intensities most sensitive to changes in @xmath102 , hnco and ch@xmath6oh , would be the most affected by a higher temperature ; the observed weakness of hnco and ch@xmath6oh in gmc a could be due to depopulation of low - lying transitions .",
    "this effect is also possible for the locized maxima of ch@xmath6oh towards gmc b. the second instance in which excitation appears to play a role is in hc@xmath6n , which is closely confined to the starburst sites .",
    "this may indicate that the sites of the strongest star formation are the locations with the highest combined density and temperature .    aside from these exceptions , variations in gas physical conditions",
    "do not appear to determine the widespread morphological changes seen in the chemical maps . since the morphology of the maps are not explained completely in terms of changes in physical conditions , variation is the chemistry  relative molecular abundances must be important .",
    "one difference between molecular clouds of our galactic disk and the clouds we observe in the nucleus of ic 342 is timescale .",
    "dynamical timescales are shorter in galactic nuclei than they are in disks .",

    "the arms seen in ic 342 are known to have strong non - circular and shearing motions , the expected response to a barred potential @xcite .",
    "it is likely that upon approaching / entering the arms , molecular clouds are either torn apart by the strong velocity gradients along the arm or are shocked due to cloud - cloud collisions , and this will happen for a significant fraction of the orbit , or every @xmath107 .",
    "the `` chemical clock '' of the molecular clouds could well be reset after traversing the arms .",
    "molecular clouds near the dynamical center of the galaxy may not be able to establish chemical equilibrium between arm passages ; clouds farther out can potentially achieve equilibrium . a transition from early - time species to late - time species as galactocentric radius increases will then be manifested .",

    "n@xmath12h@xmath7 , the most prominent late - time species detected , is actually brightest towards the central ring .",
    "therefore , we conclude that time dependent chemistry is not the dominant effect causing the chemical differences between the clouds in ic 342 . with the short orbital timescales",
