    "high - precision spectroscopy of the @xmath0@xmath1  transition in atomic hydrogen and deuterium provides an essential contribution to the determination of the rydberg constant , the lamb shift @xcite , the @xmath1 hyperfine interval @xcite as well as it allows to study nuclear properties of the proton @xcite and the deuteron @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown , that monitoring the absolute frequencies of narrow clock transitions ( like the @xmath0@xmath1  transition in hydrogen and quadrupole transitions in the hg@xmath2 and yb@xmath2 ions ) over a prolonged time interval , opens an opportunity to set a stringent restriction on the possible slow variation of the fine structure constant @xcite , testing very fundamental aspects of physics .",
    "this laboratory approach relies on the accuracy of the @xmath0@xmath1  frequency measurement , which has now reached the level of @xmath3 , but in principle has still room for improvement , since the q - factor of this transition is about @xmath4 .",
    "the accuracy which is achievable experimentally is restricted by a number of systematic effects which shift the frequency and change the line shape .",
    "so a further increase of accuracy requires not only an upgrade of the experimental setup and an improvement of the signal - to - noise ratio , but also a tighter control of the systematic effects . among these , the dynamic stark shift , the second order doppler effect and the time - of - flight ( tof ) broadening",

    "the frequency of the 486 nm laser is measured using the frequency comb technique @xcite which is described in detail in @xcite .    to efficiently excite the @xmath0@xmath1  transition in atomic hydrogen we enhance the 243 nm radiation in a linear cavity consisting of a plane incoupling mirror ( transmission @xmath6 ) and a concave outcoupling mirror ( radius @xmath7 m , @xmath8 ) separated by a distance of 29 cm as depicted in fig .",
    "the cavity loss is dominated by the diaphragms d1 and d2 that partially touch the laser mode so that the input coupling mirror roughly corresponds to impendence matching condition .",

    "in this paper we will study three types of intensity related line broadening effects : because the @xmath1 state is close enough to the continuum that a single additional 243 nm photon is sufficient to ionize the hydrogen atom reducing the effective interaction time .",
    "in addition the spatially dependent ac stark shift and the usual power broadening caused by rabi flopping are present .    for simplicity , we will analyze only hydrogen lines recorded at a particular delay , @xmath31s which corresponds to @xmath32 m / s : this is a compromise between simple line shape and sufficient signal - to - noise ratio . at this delay",

    "the line shift reveals an observable non - linearity at higher powers .",
    "it could be explained by the following contributions : ( i ) the inhomogeneous ac stark shift , ( ii ) the influence of ionization and ( iii ) the saturation of the transition . in the current analysis we took the non - linearity into account by fitting the simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a with a parabolic function .    for comparison with the full treatment",
    ", we performed the same set of calculations for three non - physical cases : with the ionization channel switched off @xmath91 , the ac stark shift is switched off @xmath92 , and both these effects are switched off @xmath93 .",
    "we see , that the main contribution to the frequency shift is due to the real part of the dynamic stark shift .",
    "the ionization , which reduces the number of atoms undergoing the highest perturbation in the intensive laser field .",
    "it also influences the frequency shift , but only if the dynamic stark shift is present as well .",
    "all data sets in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a converge at zero power to the same value of @xmath94 which corresponds to the mean second order doppler shift for the given beam temperature of @xmath66 k and the delay time @xmath67s .",
    "this value is considerably smaller than the maximal shift of @xmath95 hz calculated for @xmath96 .",
    "this difference is caused by the fact that the velocity distribution of atoms which contribute to the signal @xmath97 is different from the velocity distribution of atoms in the beam @xmath24 : neglecting additional losses it is given by @xmath98 consequently , the doppler correction must take this weighting into account .",
    "a further correction to the effective second order doppler effect is invoked by the preferred removal of slow atoms . as seen in fig.[fig3]a ( for @xmath99 , @xmath86 ) this preference and",
    "thus the associated shift is vastly independent of laser power for our experimental conditions . as it is impossible in our experiment to measure the stark coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath101 separately , we analyze the values which can be derived both from the experiment and our numerical analysis , namely the slopes @xmath102 and @xmath103 of the power dependencies given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig3]a , b .",
    "on the experimental side , we derive these values for each of the 12 days of measurement exactly in the same way as depicted in fig .",
    "the results for each day are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig3]c , d .",
    "one observes a significant scatter of the day - to - day data , with @xmath104 ( the reduced @xmath105 or birge ratio @xcite ) , which could be partly ascribed to errors on the power axis , coming from both the calibration of the photodiode measuring the 243 nm power and from temporal variations of the transmittance of the curved mirror in fig .",
    "therefore we average these data without taking into account the individual uncertainties and obtain @xmath106 hz / mw and @xmath107 hz / mw .    extracting the coefficient @xmath102 from the results of the numerical analysis , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , is not straightforward , since the curve for the shift of the line center are not linear and therefore @xmath102 is not strictly defined .",
    "however , since the scatter in the experimental data is larger than the calculated nonlinearities , it is enough on the present level of accuracy to replace the parabolic fit by a linear fit in the case of the frequency shift - intensity dependence ( @xmath102 ) , in order to evaluate the results in the same way as in the experiment . to reduce the error introduced by this procedure ,",
    "we restrict the data points taken into account by the fit to those which fall into the experimental range of powers : @xmath108 .",
    "the value resulting from the monte carlo analysis is denoted as @xmath109 in analogy to the notation in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    to test the sensitivity of the model to the experimental conditions and to evaluate the corresponding uncertainties we also performed a set of simulations for different beam temperatures , varying between 4 k and 6 k , slightly different interaction lengths and a reduced radius @xmath110 of the diaphragm d1 .",
    "all these tests show a low sensitivity of results to these parameters which allows to compare them with the experimental data .",

    "[ fig3]c : with an atomic beam temperature of 4 and 5 kelvin and for a diaphragm size matched and centered to the laser beam to simulate the nozzle covered with a molecular hydrogen film .",
    "the last case corresponds to a possible situation , where a film of molecular hydrogen symmetrically covers the nozzle from inside in such a way that the nozzle radius equals either @xmath111 or @xmath70 m ( the film eventually touches the laser beam ) .",
    "the frozen nozzle radially restricts the atomic trajectories on the entrance to the interaction zone , which results in changing the intensity profiles .",
    "the growth of the h@xmath112 film was a characteristic feature of the hydrogen spectrometer working at the lowest beam temperature .",
    "the measurement cycle lasted about 15 min , after which the nozzle was heated to 20 k to melt the film .    comparing the averaged value @xmath102 with the results of the numerical simulation",
    ", we can establish an agreement on the level of about 15% uncertainty with respect to the absolute values .",
    "as follows from the previous analysis , the intensity - dependent frequency shift is mainly caused by the ac stark shift which contributes to the general detuning ( [ detuning ] ) .",
    "using the linearity of the effect at low powers one can conclude , that this analysis allows to verify @xmath113 at the same confidence level of 15% and therefore we can experimentally verify the results of the calculations of @xmath114 presented in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the line width is more complicated in comparison with the analysis of the frequency shift since a number of different effects contribute significantly to the line broadening .",
    "the line width consists of intensity - independent and intensity - dependent parts .",
    "the intensity - independent part includes the laser spectral line width and the time - of - flight broadening , while such effects as power broadening , inhomogeneous ac stark broadening and ionization broadening contribute to the latter part .",
    "in addition , temporal intensity fluctuations of the laser radiation in the excitation region also induce an additional intensity - dependent broadening due to the variable stark shift .",
    "thus , assuming for simplicity the lorentzian profiles , one can write :    @xmath115    where @xmath41 is the total line width , @xmath116 is the contribution of the time - of - flight broadening , and @xmath117 includes all intensity - dependent effects with @xmath118 .",
    "the laser line width @xmath119 carries a factor of 4 because we measure it at 486  nm whereas all other transition frequencies correspond to 121 nm .",
    "it has been shown experimentally , that the spectral line width of our laser system doubles for the frequency doubling process .",
    "we understand that each of the contributions listed above has a complex spectral shape which can significantly differ from lorentzian and the expression ( [ laserlinewidth ] ) can be used only for rough estimations .",
    "still , the simulations show that in our case the time - of - flight broadening has near - to - lorentzian spectral line shape while heterodyne experiments indicate the same for the spectral line of our laser system .    as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , the intensity - dependent part of the line width is formed by three different processes : ( i ) the power broadening , ( ii ) the inhomogeneous ac stark shift in the laser beam profile and ( iii ) the ionization of the @xmath1 state .",
    "the pure power broadening corresponds to the case @xmath120 and is due to rabi flopping between the ground and the excited states , effectively reducing the lifetime of the population in the excited @xmath1 state .",
    "the inhomogeneous ac stark shift in the case @xmath121 originates from a gaussian intensity profile in the excitation region .",
    "the last significant broadening comes from ionization which contributes in a highly nontrivial way illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figmax]b , c .",
    "the excessive loss of slow atoms has been taken into account in the line form model @xcite as an empirical modification of the low - velocity wing of the maxwellian @xmath122-dependency in eq .",
    "( [ maxw ] ) .",
    "there it was assumed that the slow atoms are missing from the beam because of collisions with the fast atoms ( zacharias effect ) .",
    "however , now we conclude that no such mechanism is necessary to fit our data and the selective ionization is the most significant effect responsible for this loss . strictly speaking , one deals with three distinct velocity distributions : ( i ) the atoms emerging from the nozzle , ( ii ) the detected @xmath1 atoms , and ( iii ) the ground state atoms .",
    "whereas the first distribution is assumed to be maxwellian ( eq .  ( [ maxw ] ) ) , the second is relevant for determining the line shape .    to compare with the experimental results",
    ", we also evaluated the contribution of the temporal intensity fluctuations . in principle , this effect is equivalent to the considered inhomogeneous ac stark shift , but integrated over time , not space . in the experiment , we observed fast intensity fluctuations on the level of @xmath123 during the excitation cycle .",
    "we embedded this process into the simulation by adding white noise with a @xmath124 band to @xmath50 .",
    "the effect lies within the uncertainty of the calculations for the given number of atoms used in the simulation .    for the line width as a function of laser power ,",
    "the slope is derived from the fit similar to the case of fig.[fig3]a .",
    "the value resulting from the monte carlo analysis is denoted as @xmath125 .",
    "the line width , extrapolated to zero power , is @xmath126 hz which corresponds to the theoretical value for the averaged time - of - flight broadening for the given delay @xmath127 in the absence of other broadening contributions ( fig  [ fig3]b ) .",
    "the value @xmath103 can be tested in the same way as @xmath128 with an uncertainty of 18% ( see fig .  [",
    "fig3]d ) . due to the complex structure of this value and the number of contributions of different nature which add up to the total line broadening , it is impossible to disentangle them and to set separate restrictions on the transition matrix element and the ionization cross - section . nevertheless ,",
    "if we switch off any of the important broadening mechanisms , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig3 ] , the simulation will no longer agree so well with the experimental observation .",
    "this means that both the calculations performed in @xcite as well as the current analysis adequately describes the excitation dynamics of the hydrogen atom in the presence of photoionization .    for consistency of our analysis , we also performed an evaluation of the laser line width @xmath119 .",
    "studies of the spectral laser line width at 486 nm , based on the investigation of beat signals , resulted in a value of 60 hz @xcite . in the framework of this paper",
    ", we can make an estimate of its spectral line width with a different , indirect method . to this end , we compare the calculated line width at zero laser power @xmath129 with the experimentally observed line width @xmath130 , where the latter is obtained by averaging the extrapolated day values for the line width similar to fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , resulting in @xmath131 hz . from eq .",
    "( [ laserlinewidth ] ) we obtain @xmath132 hz , which is consistent with the previous independent measurement @xcite .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath133 magnetic components is negligible in the experiment .",
    "an attempt to directly evaluate the expected lyman-@xmath20 count rate in the given experimental geometry and thus test the theoretical values more directly fails due to the large uncertainties in the beam density , the fraction of atomic hydrogen in it and the detection efficiency .",
    "the presented indirect analysis happens to be much more sensitive to the absolute values of the transition matrix elements and the ionization cross section than the direct evaluations .      at the end of this section",
    "we discuss the conclusions of the current analysis regarding the absolute frequency measurement of the @xmath0@xmath1  transition in atomic hydrogen .",
    "first of all , we want to point out the non - linearity of the frequency shift of the line center as a function of the laser power ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "our analysis shows , that our previous linear fit leads to an error of 10 - 20 hz in the determination of the absolute @xmath0@xmath1  frequency @xmath134 , if we restrict ourselves to the experimental range of powers ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "this does not contradict the uncertainty of the line shape model of 20 hz given in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the derivation of the possible small temporal drift of the @xmath0@xmath1  frequency @xcite this error cancels out .",
    "still , for a further improvement of the @xmath0@xmath1  frequency measurement it is highly desirable to reduce the laser intensity and thus reduce the error and the uncertainty of the extrapolation .",
    "secondly , the calculations show , that due to the photoionization , the velocity distribution of atoms escaping the nozzle significantly differs from the distribution of atoms contributing to the signal . for the correction of the second order doppler effect it is more physical to model the initial velocity distribution in the nozzle by a maxwellian distribution ( see eq .",
    "( [ maxw ] ) ) , which is dynamically modified by the ionization process of atoms with long interaction times , instead of modelling an effective velocity distribution at the detector . on the other hand , the magnitude of the doppler effect , which has been one of the biggest concerns in the last measurements @xcite is already on the level of @xmath136 hz for a delay time of @xmath31s .",
    "this opens an opportunity to use a simplified line shape model to correct for this effect .",
    "we have performed an evaluation of the whole data set obtained in 2003 measurement @xcite using such a simplified approach .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1  spectral lines detected with the delays @xmath137s have been fitted by lorentzian functions .",
    "the frequencies of the line centers have been corrected for the second - order doppler effect by adding the calculated frequency shift .",
    "the result of this analysis was consistent with the result of the full line shape model @xcite within the uncertainty of the model .",
    "the shift should be sensitive to the initial velocity distribution which can differ from ( [ maxw ] ) due to e.g. geometrical factors , unperfect thermalization or collisions .",
    "the delayed detection modifying the velocity distribution ( [ modmax ] ) drastically reduces the mean doppler shift as well as its sensitivity to the initial distribution .",
    "we tested numerically , that the substitution of the @xmath122 dependency ( [ maxw ] ) by @xmath138 results in a mean doppler shift of @xmath139 hz for @xmath140s , which is only 3 hz aside the previous value of @xmath136 hz .",
    "the difference decreases for increasing @xmath19 and the corresponding uncertainty in the determination the @xmath0@xmath1  frequency can be reduced to a few hertz .",
    "thus , using such a simplified model we can correct the second - order order doppler effect with an uncertainty on the level of a few parts in @xmath141 .",

    "since the nozzle temperature is lower than its melting point of 14 k , molecular hydrogen effectively freezes on the nozzle walls and reduces its diameter . in the experiment",
    ", we had to melt molecular hydrogen approximately once per 20 min to avoid significant losses of laser power and atomic hydrogen flux in the 243 nm cavity .",
    "our simulation allows for different spatial seedings of starting points of the atomic trajectories at the diaphragms , which can be used to model a reduced nozzle diameter or a misalignment of the cavity mode with respect to the atomic beam axis .",
    "we have performed a simulation of a whole day of measurement recording the 1210 @xmath57s delayed spectra at 100 different intensities , while varying the nozzle radius randomly in the range from @xmath142 down to @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting line center fits as a function of laser power per direction are shown in fig .",
    "[ figmartin]b .",
    "figure  [ figmartin]a results from the same simulation but with a permanently free nozzle . an uncontrolled freezing leads to an excess scatter of the line centers , increasing for larger exciting powers .",
    "specifically , a smaller radius at the entrance diaphragm results in an upwards shift in line center frequency , the shift increasing with excitation power .",
    "this is consistent with the observation in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c , where a small nozzle radius results in a larger value for @xmath102 . as a result ,",
    "a linear fit in the range of 0.10.5 w and an extrapolation to zero intensity gives different values for the absolute frequency depending on the amount of nozzle freezing .",
    "typically the scatter is on the level of a few tens of hertz , which can only partly explain the scatter observed in the experiments  @xcite .",
    "other contributions can originate in uncertainties of the power axis and misalignment of the 243 nm enhancement cavity . in future measurements",
    "we will aim at increasing the nozzle diameter to avoid restriction of the atomic trajectories , working at lower excitation powers , and improving the stability of the enhancement cavity including power stabilization .",
    "the beam nature of the @xmath0@xmath1  spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen imposes certain restrictions on the experimental conditions like high intensity of the excitation field , impossibility of further cooling of the beam , short interaction time and freezing of the nozzle .",
    "the enumerated effects result in a number of systematic shifts and corresponding loss of accuracy .",
    "note , that all optical spectroscopic experiments demonstrating the accuracy better than @xmath143 deal with cold ions or atoms in traps ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all the systematic shifts of the @xmath0@xmath1transition discussed in the paper would be significantly reduced or eliminated if the hydrogen atoms were slowed down by laser cooling or if one used hydrogen - like ions that could be held in a trap @xcite .    based on considerations of this section",
    "we can conclude , that perturbation of the mode of the enhancement cavity results in a frequency shift via the intensity related shift and broadenings .",
    "though the cavity is not confocal which ensures the suppression factor over 500 for the tem@xmath144 mode , the intra - cavity diaphragms can influence the structure of the tem@xmath16 cavity mode .",
    "monte - carlo simulations performed for impure tem@xmath16 mode shows that the results presented in the article remain valid if the power falling into the tem@xmath144 mode does not exceed 5% .",
    "thus , special attention should be paid for intensity stabilization , coupling and alignment of the cavity to avoid any additional non resonant light . after taking the issues",
    "discussed in the paper into account it seems realistic to reduce the uncertainty of the determination of the @xmath0@xmath1  frequency to the level of a few parts in @xmath141 .",
    "in this article we discussed the transient excitation dynamics of the @xmath0@xmath1  transition of atomic hydrogen under irradiation of two counter - propagating 243 nm light beams .",
    "the main focus of the present analysis has been the inclusion of photoionization of the @xmath1 state , power broadening and the inhomogeneous ac stark in the quantum dynamics and the detailed study of their influence on the transition frequency and its line width .    though photoionization would only insignificantly change the line width of each individual atom in the experimental range of excitation powers and interaction times in a laser field of constant intensity , the preferred ionization of slow @xmath1 atoms results in a substantial broadening of the observed collective spectrum .",
    "the modelling shows , that the resulting intensity - dependent frequency shift is mainly caused by the dynamic stark shift , while the intensity - dependent line broadening results from power broadening , the dynamic stark shift in a spatially inhomogeneous laser field and the influence of photoionization .    for our simulation we used the values of the transition matrix elements , the dynamic stark shift coefficients and the ionization rates",
    "re - derived in @xcite .",
    "the results of the simulation show a fair agreement with the experimentally observed ones .",
    "we can confirm the value of the difference of the dynamic stark shift coefficients @xmath145 with an accuracy of 15% using the analysis of the @xmath0@xmath1  frequency shift .",
    "the analysis of the line broadening also shows a good agreement with the experimental values within 18% . due to a complex structure of the intensity - dependent line broadening",
    "it does not allow to make definite conclusions about the ionization coefficient , though indicating that our treatment of the excitation process in the thermal beam is correct .",
    "the uncertainty of the determination of the @xmath0@xmath1  frequency is determined not only by the experimental accuracy , but also by the uncertainty of the line shape model and the correction of the dynamic stark shift .",
    "taking photoionization into account allows to build a more accurate line shape model .",
    "factors such as non - linearity of the line shift and geometrical factors contribute on a level comparable in magnitude with the second order doppler effect , which has been of major concern in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the monte - carlo approach presented in this paper allows to perform accurate quantitative evaluations of all these effects and make an accurate evaluation of the final uncertainty .",
