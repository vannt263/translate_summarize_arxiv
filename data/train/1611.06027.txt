    "the emission - line flux ratio is one method that can be used to derive the abundance ratio , and the emission lines from and have been considered as an ideal line pair .",
    "their similar ionization energies would cause these two ions to coexist at a similar location in a broad - line region ( blr ) cloud .",
    "this assumption is partly supported by recent reverberation mapping studies , which imply that the emission region in quasars exists at a similar location to h@xmath10 that represents other broad emission lines including ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    ", so the locations of the and regions may not be the same ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "] therefore , the flux ratio would be at least linearly related to the abundance ratio ( e.g. , ) .",
    "emission lines observed in quasar spectra were thus eagerly studied in the 1970s and 1980s ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) . from their photoionization calculations and comparison with observations , @xcite and",
    "@xcite showed that iron is presumably overabundant in comparison with the solar value for quasars , having large flux relative to . under these circumstances ,",
    "the / flux ratio was assumed to be a first - order proxy for the mg / fe abundance ratio , and has been measured over a wide range of redshift extending to @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) . however , the measured flux ratios show a large scatter beyond measurement errors , especially at high redshift , preventing us from finding any signature for the [ mg / fe ] break .",
    "doubt is then cast on the usual assumption that the / flux ratio is a first - order proxy for the mg / fe abundance ratio ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite systematically investigated emission lines by using the photoionization cloudy code combined with the 371-level fe@xmath12 model ( @xcite ) .",
    "their calculations show that the strength of the emission lines depends not only on iron abundance , but also on gas density , the ionization parameter , column density , and microturbulence .",
    "@xcite also argued the importance of such dependence using their original 830-level fe@xmath12 model .",
    "therefore , the large scatter observed for / may be accounted for by the effects of non - abundance parameters that may differ from quasar to quasar .    in fact , @xcite found that / strongly correlates with the eddington ratio .",
    "they also argued that in most plausible scenarios connecting active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and starburst activities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the delay between the two events is less than 1 gyr , so @xmath2-elements should be enhanced relative to iron during the active phase of agns .",
    "an anticorrelation between / and the eddington ratio is then naturally expected , whereas the observation contradicts it .",
    "these results imply the existence of non - abundance parameters that would seriously affect /.",
    "in summary , there is growing evidence that the / flux ratio is only a `` second - order '' proxy for the mg / fe abundance ratio .",
    "however , there have been few reports as to whether the abundance information can be extracted quantitatively from observables against these non - abundance effects .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to invent reliable diagnostics of the mg / fe abundance ratio for a blr cloud .",
    "a sufficient number of quasars selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) are analyzed to measure their / flux ratios , and photoionization calculations are carried out to interpret / in terms of the mg / fe abundance ratio .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe the sample selection and the data reduction of sdss quasars . in section 3 ,",
    "measured emission - line strengths of the sdss quasars are summarized . in section 4 ,",
    "parameter setting for the photoionization model is described , and the results are given in section 5 . in section 6 , we discuss the dependence of / on non - abundance parameters , propose new abundance diagnostics for a blr cloud , and compare the derived mg / fe abundance ratios with chemical evolution models to constrain star formation history . in section 7 , a summary and conclusion are given . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath13cdm cosmology , with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "our sample is selected from the quasar catalog of the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) , in which 105,783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars are included ( @xcite ) .",
    "the following two criteria are adopted for our sample selection .",
    "firstly , a rest frame wavelength range of 22003500  is available ; this is required to measure both and emission lines , and the continuum level around them . since the wavelength range covered by the spectroscopic observation in the sdss dr7 is 38009200 , this criterion confines the redshift range within @xmath17 . secondly , the median value of the signal to noise ratios ( s / ns ) in the entire wavelength range of the sdss spectra is larger than 10 pix@xmath18 ; from experience , this is required for accurate measurement of and emission lines .",
    "we find that 17,468 objects fulfill these two criteria .",
    "according to the catalog given by @xcite , 254 objects out of 17,468 are flagged as broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars .",
    "although these bal quasars are not excluded in the following analysis , we note that whether or not these are excluded from our sample affects none of the conclusions of this paper .",
    "the fluxes of the and emission lines are measured for the selected quasars in almost the same way as that used by @xcite .",
    "firstly , the following continuum model is fitted to each spectrum : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a power - law continuum flux emitted from an accretion disk , @xmath21 is a balmer continuum flux and @xmath22 is a pseudo - continuum flux .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the balmer continuum model given by @xcite for @xmath21 ; the shape and the flux ratio against the power - law component are fixed to those adopted by @xcite .",
    "unlike @xcite , however , we use the template given by @xcite instead of that of @xcite ; this is because the latter does not cover the wavelength range around the emission line .",
    "prior to fitting , the template is broadened by convolution with a gaussian function for which the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is fixed at 2,000 km s@xmath18 .",
    "there are thus three free parameters : the power - law slope ( @xmath2 ) , the normalization of the power - law continuum flux ( @xmath10 ) , and the normalization of the pseudo - continuum flux ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the best fit parameters are obtained by performing @xmath24 minimization with the idl procedure mpfit.pro ( @xcite ) .",
    "flux is calculated by integrating the fitted template in a wavelength range of 22003090 .",
    "then , fitting of the @xmath0 emission line is performed ; two gaussians are fitted to the continuum - subtracted spectrum at the rest frame wavelength range of 27002900  with the mpfit.pro procedure .",
    "both the flux and the fwhm of are calculated from the sum of the two fitted gaussians . in these processes",
    ", there are failures in the fittings for 36 quasars . however , since the number is too small to affect the result , we have decided to exclude them from the following analysis .",
    "the mass of a black hole ( bh ) , or @xmath25 , is estimated from the fwhm and the continuum luminosity at 3000  by using the virial mass estimate formula ( @xcite ) : @xmath26 the eddington luminosity is defined as the luminosity at which the radiation force acting on an electron ",
    "proton pair is balanced with the gravitation force exerted on the pair . for a blr cloud orbiting the central bh ,",
    "the eddington luminosity is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gravitational constant , @xmath29 is the speed of light , @xmath30 is the proton mass , and @xmath31 is the thomson scattering cross section ( @xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the bolometric luminosity from the measured monochromatic luminosity at 3000  with the bolometric correction formula : @xmath32 from equations ( [ eq : bhmass])([eq : bol_lumi ] ) , the eddington ratio is written as @xmath33 for all the quasars in our sample , the eddington ratio is evaluated using this formula .    in summary ,",
    "our final sample consists of @xmath34 quasars in the redshift range of @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ fig : measure ] shows histograms of the measured values of various quantities such as redshift , monochromatic luminosity at 3000 , rest - frame equivalent widths ( ews ) of and , bh mass , and the eddington ratio of our sample of sdss quasars .",
    "the ews of and emission lines are calculated by dividing the measured flux by the continuum flux density at 3000 . as previous studies have pointed out ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , mpfit.pro likely underestimates measurement errors , because it does not account for potential systematic errors related to , e.g. , pseudocontinuum subtraction .",
    "therefore , typical measurement errors are estimated by monte carlo simulations ( see @xcite ) as follows : 16% for ew ( ) , 7.2% for ew ( ) , 7.9% for fwhm",
    "( ) , and 10% for @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ fig : mgiifeii_redshift ] plots the measured / flux ratios against their redshifts .",
    "it is clear that / shows no significant evolution at @xmath36@xmath37 .",
    "this result is consistent with @xcite , in whose analysis an earlier version of the sdss data was used .",
    "from comparison of the measured values , we find that ew ( ) positively correlates with ew ( ) , as seen from the @xmath38 ew ( ) versus @xmath38 ew ( ) plot in figure [ fig : ew_mgii_feii ] . to examine how this correlation depends on the eddington ratio , we divide our sample into five sub - samples : ( i ) @xmath39 , ( ii ) @xmath40@xmath41 , ( iii ) @xmath41@xmath42 , ( iv ) @xmath42@xmath43 , and ( v ) @xmath44 .",
    "these sub - samples are shown by different colors in figure [ fig : ew_mgii_feii ] .",
    "it is evident that quasars with larger @xmath45 tend to have smaller ew ( ) .",
    "dependence of / , ,  and  on @xmath45 is highlighted in figure [ fig : fluxratio_ew_edd ] .",
    "negative correlation against @xmath45 is clearly seen for /  and ew ( ) . on the other hand , ew ( ) has a tentative , positive correlation with @xmath45 .",
    "we have performed linear regression analysis using the bces(y`|`x ) method ( @xcite ) , which takes into account measurement errors on both variables .",
    "the result is summarized in table [ tab : correlation ] , where the calculated spearman s correlation coefficients are also listed .",
    "it is worth mentioning the preceding research by @xcite .",
    "they analyzed 4,178 seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars selected from sdss dr4",
    "for which redshifts are @xmath46 .",
    "they reported that the / flux ratio positively correlates with the eddington ratio , which is consistent with our result .",
    "note that they analyzed both uv and optical emission lines , therefore the redshift range of their sample is restricted .",
    "compared with their analysis , we have used the later version of the sdss data and concentrated on the uv emission line , which has increased the sample size by almost four times and widened the redshift range .",
    "one of the most interesting results of @xcite is that narrow emission in optical has a stronger correlation with the eddington ratio than .",
    "whether the narrow emission line exists in uv is unclear and investigating it is beyond the scope of this paper , but we may safely say that the slight correlation between the uv and the eddington ratio seen in figure [ fig : fluxratio_ew_edd ] implies that contribution from the narrow emission in uv is small .",
    "the mgii / feii@xmath45 correlation is thus evident from observation , but the background physics behind it has not been well understood so far . in the following part of this paper , we investigate the origin of such emission - line correlations with the eddington ratio .",

    "photoionization calculations have been carried out to investigate how and emission lines emitted from a blr cloud depend on non - abundance parameters such as gas density , the ionization parameter , total h column density , spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the illuminating source , and microturbulence .",
    "the values of these parameters are varied in their plausible respective ranges in calculations . in this section ,",
    "we first explain the constraints on these parameters inferred from recent studies of blr reverberation mapping .",
    "then , we explain our choice of fiducial parameter values for a blr cloud",
    ".      recent studies of blr reverberation mapping ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have revealed the so - called radius ",
    "luminosity relationship ; the reverberation radius is larger for more luminous agns . from naive theoretical consideration",
    ", @xmath56 is naturally expected under the assumption that the central radiation field is the only source of heating and ionization .",
    "in fact , @xcite measured h@xmath10 lag times of 41 nearby agns from blr reverberation mapping observations , and showed that the radius ",
    "luminosity relationship holds for agns over four orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "although there exist few studies of reverberation mapping for the emitting region , @xcite report that the reverberation radius is almost the same as h@xmath10 for ngc 4151 . recently , @xcite report lag detection of 6 quasars at @xmath57 , which also supports overlap between the regions in which mgii  and h@xmath10 originate .",
    "under the situation that no reliable lag detection at @xmath58 is available , it is reasonable to assume that the emission line is created in the same region as h@xmath10 even at @xmath58 .",
    "thus , we assume that the radius  luminosity relationship for is the same as for h@xmath10 given in @xcite , and",
    "is written as @xmath59^{0.5 } , \\label{eq : sizelumi}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the reverberation radius .",
    "note that we here adopt the power index of 0.5 , as theoretically expected .",
    "the coefficient in equation ( [ eq : sizelumi ] ) is determined by fitting a slope - fixed straight line to the data of @xcite .",
    "this radius ",
    "luminosity relationship places an important constraint on the physical quantities of a blr cloud .",
    "let @xmath61 be the ionization parameter defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the hydrogen number density of the gas , @xmath29 is the speed of light , and @xmath64 is the incident hydrogen - ionizing photon flux .",
    "furthermore , @xmath64 can be reduced to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the frequency corresponding to the ionization energy of h@xmath67 ( 13.6 ev ) , @xmath68 is the flux density of the incident continuum at the illuminated face of a cloud , @xmath69 is the luminosity of the central source at frequency @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the number of hydrogen - ionizing photons emitted per second from the source . from equations ( [ eq : sizelumi])([eq : ion_flux ] ) , the product of @xmath63 and @xmath61 for the emitting region yields @xmath72 where the term @xmath73 depends only on the sed of the incident continuum .",
    "following the user manual of the cloudy code ( last described by @xcite ) , we have modeled the sed of an agn as follows : @xmath74 where the first term on the right - hand side indicates the so - called _ big blue bump _ component , and the second term indicates the non - thermal x - ray component .",
    "the former is modeled as a power law with the index @xmath75 , which has exponential cutoffs at the energies of @xmath76 and @xmath77 ; the latter is modeled as a power law with the index @xmath78 , which is truncated at energies less than 1.36 ev in order to prevent it from extending into the infrared part , and falls off as @xmath79 at energies larger than 100 kev . the coefficient @xmath80 , which determines a fraction between the two components ,",
    "is uniquely determined if the well - used optical to x - ray spectral index @xmath81/\\log(403.3)$ ] . ] and the spectral indices @xmath82 are once specified .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ev to reproduce the sed of a typical agn .",
    "this results in @xmath85 and @xmath86 . substituting the latter value into equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath87 or @xmath88 . to evaluate the dependence of sed diversity observed in quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we have varied the x - ray power - law index @xmath78 and the spectral index @xmath81 in a wide range of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively , from the above sed .",
    "the resultant value of @xmath91 , however , changes only by 0.2 dex .",
    "it is thus appropriate to assume that all quasars in our sample follow @xmath92 .",
    "we note that this constraint is always taken into account in the following photoionization calculations of the and emission lines .",

    "the fact that most quasars show both and emission lines suggests that blr clouds generally have @xmath171 . as @xmath140 increases beyond @xmath172 , the size of the piz increases .",
    "as a result , the strength of the emission line from the piz increases , while the strength of the emission line from the fiz is unaffected . note that @xcite similarly argued for the @xmath140 dependence of the emission line for , but not .",
    "the results for varying the x - ray power - law index @xmath78 and the spectral index @xmath81 , both of which effectively determine the strength of the sed at @xmath173 kev , are shown in panels @xmath29 and @xmath174 of figure [ fig : ew_dependence ] .",
    "our photoionization calculations show that both ew ( ) and ew ( ) do not change very much with varying @xmath78 and @xmath81",
    ". in particular , the changes of ew ( ) and / with the x - ray sed are too small to reproduce their observed ranges .",
    "similar results are also reported by @xcite . because incident x - ray photons are widely assumed as the main heating source in the piz",
    ", it may seem strange that the emission depends little on the x - ray sed .",
    "in fact , our calculations indicate that harder sed gives rise to larger electron density and hence more cooling by fe@xmath167 ions especially at large cloud depth in the piz .",
    "however , the emissivities of those additionally created uv photons at large cloud depth are quite small due to their large optical depths there ( see figure [ fig : emissivity ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the emissivity of uv emission line as a whole is little affected by the x - ray sed of an illuminating source .",
    "the dependence on the uv power - law index @xmath75 is shown in panel @xmath175 of figure [ fig : ew_dependence ] .",
    "as indicated in the figure , ew ( ) decreases with @xmath75 .",
    "this is mainly due to less incident photons having the energy less than 13.6 ev for larger @xmath75 .",
    "those low - energy photons can penetrate the fiz and photoexcite fe@xmath167 ions in the piz .",
    "therefore , continuum pumping of fe@xmath167 ions and the resulting emission lines decrease when @xmath75 increases . on the other hand ,",
    "our photoionization calculations indicate that ew ( ) increases with @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , we find that the line flux of hardly changes with @xmath75 ; this result is understandable , because emission lines are mainly created at the fiz which is transparent to those low energy photons with @xmath176 ev .",
    "thus , the increase of ew ( ) with @xmath75 is mainly due to the decrease of continuum flux at 3000 .",
    "the @xmath145 dependence is shown in panel @xmath177 of figure [ fig : ew_dependence ] .",
    "larger @xmath145 gives rise to larger ew ( ) and ew ( ) ; this is because the local velocity difference in the moving medium decreases the self - absorption of the line photons , which causes them to escape more easily from the cloud .",
    "however , by calculating the / flux ratio , such @xmath145 dependence for each of the ews is largely cancelled out .",
    "the resultant ratio hardly changes with @xmath163 .",
    "the assumption that the / flux ratio is a first - order proxy for the mg / fe abundance ratio would hold only if the and emission lines were found to originate from the same region owing to their similar ionization energies ( e.g. , ) .",
    "however , the result of our photoionization calculations shown in figure [ fig : emissivity ] is highly suggestive of a difference in the emergent zone between the and emission lines ; flux comes mostly from the fiz , while flux comes from the piz .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : ionfract_compare ] , the ionization structure of a blr cloud depends on the non - abundance parameter of @xmath63 , and more importantly , this @xmath63 dependence for the fiz is different from that for the piz .",
    "thus , our result invalidates the assumption of / @xmath178 mg / fe , and indicates that the / flux ratio strongly depends on some non - abundance parameter other than the mg / fe abundance ratio .",
    "our result therefore supports similar arguments previously given by other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mg / fe abundance ratio can then be derived from the / flux ratio _ after _ the effects of some non - abundance parameter , yet to be identified as a main driver of the existing correlations among observable quantities of quasars , have been properly corrected .",
    "comparison of figures [ fig : fluxratio_ew_edd ] and [ fig : ew_dependence ] hints at a way of identifying such a parameter .",
    "figure [ fig : fluxratio_ew_edd ] indicates that emission - line flux correlates with @xmath45 , but emission - line flux does not . from the result of our photoionization calculations in figure [ fig : ew_dependence ] , those trends with @xmath45 are fully reproduced solely by changing @xmath63 , when an anticorrelation exists between @xmath63 and @xmath45 .",
    "on the other hand , those trends are not reproduced by changing either @xmath140 , the sed , or @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to proceed with a hypothesis that the non - abundance parameter to be identified is mainly the blr gas density that anticorrelates with the eddington ratio , and the observed diversity of flux is partly attributed to object to object variation of the blr gas density in quasars .",
    "our hypothesis of anticorrelation between @xmath63 and @xmath45 could be supported by the following discussion . for our sample of sdss quasars , we obtain ew ( ) @xmath179 ( figure [ fig : fluxratio_ew_edd ] and table [ tab : correlation ] ) , and from our photoionization calculations , we find ew ( ) @xmath180 ( figure [ fig : ew_dependence ] ) .",
    "these two relations are combined to give @xmath181 . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite argued that the blr gas density decreases with the increasing radial distance of the cloud away from the agn center , i.e. , @xmath182 .",
    "therefore , our hypothesis requires @xmath183 , provided @xmath184 .",
    "we can check this requisite using the reverberation mapping data given in @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : radius_edd ] , where a positive correlation is clearly seen .",
    "a linear regression analysis gives @xmath185 , leading to @xmath186 within the limits of @xmath187 in accordance with @xcite . in this way ,",
    "our hypothesis of anticorrelation between @xmath63 and @xmath45 is well confirmed by the data .",
    "establishing a method of deriving heavy - element abundances of a blr cloud is the most important problem in chemical evolution studies using quasars . for a long time",
    ", the / flux ratio has been used as a proxy for the fe / mg abundance ratio . however , as described in the previous section , we have reached the conclusion that the strength of the emission line strongly depends on the non - abundance parameter of the blr gas density .",
    "accordingly , the / flux ratio , unless corrected for the density effect , can never be used as a measure of the mg / fe abundance ratio . in this section",
    ", we describe a conversion of flux to abundance for quasars .",
    "the first step is to correct ew(mgii ) for the density effect , by scaling the observed ew(mgii ) values of all quasars to those for the reference value of the eddington ratio .",
    "the corrected ew(mgii ) is given by @xmath188 where @xmath189 is adopted as a median value of the measured eddington ratios of the sample quasars ( see figure [ fig : measure ] ) .",

correspondence between the ( mg / fe , fe / h ) abundance pair and the ( ew()@xmath190 , ew ( ) ) pair , by running the cloudy simulation code with other non - abundance parameters fixed to the fiducial values given in table [ tab : baseline ] . for realistic simulations with the heavy - element abundance pattern of stellar origin , we mix the yield patterns of sn ia and sn ii , following @xcite . the ejecta masses of heavy elements for sn ia are adopted from the w7 model in @xcite , and those for sn ii are adopted from @xcite and @xcite . since the ejecta mass of each element for sn ii depends on the mass of the progenitor star , we calculate the mean ejecta mass weighted by an initial mass function ( imf ) of stars .",

    "we introduce a parameter @xmath562 for the mass fraction contributed by sn ia per unit mass of all heavy elements .",

    "that the measured ews are covered by the ( mg / fe , [ fe / h ] ) grid for reasonable respective ranges of mg / fe and [ fe / h ] justifies our conversion of ( ew()@xmath190 , ew ( ) to ( mg / fe , [ fe / h ] ) . as can be seen from figures [ fig : ew_mgfe_feh_nomoto ] and [ fig : ew_mgfe_feh_woosley ] ,",
    "the lines of constant mg / fe are slightly curved , non - orthogonal to those of constant [ fe / h ] , and inclined to the major axis of distribution of the measured ews .",

    "typical uncertainties of the measured [ mg / fe ] and [ fe / h ] are estimated to be 0.27 dex and 0.32 dex , respectively , from the error propagation of the measurement errors on ew ( ) and ew ( ) . with no alternative methods reported previously , this conversion is the first attempt to reliably extract the abundance information from the emission lines of metals .",
    "the goal of this study is to constrain the star formation history in the universe from the chemical evolution of quasar host galaxies .",
    "in contrast with previous studies , in which the / flux ratio is used as the mg / fe abundance ratio , our proposed method allows measurement of the mg / fe abundance ratio , enabling direct comparison with theoretical chemical evolution models .",
    "figure [ fig : chem_evo ] ( _ top panel _ ) shows the result of [ mg / fe ] as a function of redshift for our sdss quasars plotted in figure [ fig : ew_mgfe_feh_nomoto ] .",
    "the mean values of the derived [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios in each redshift bin ( @xmath577 ) are indicated by filled boxes .",
    "the error bars indicate @xmath578 , where @xmath579 is the standard deviation of the derived [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios in each redshift bin and @xmath580 is the measurement error of [ mg / fe ] estimated in the previous subsection .",
    "therefore , they represent systematic errors of the covering factor and the parameters listed in table [ tab : baseline ] . given that a lot of parameters are fixed to the fiducial values , the derived error bars are so small that support the validity of our assumptions . the sn ii yields of @xcite are used in the figure , but it should be noted that even if those of @xcite are used , the result remains almost the same except for a small offset in [ mg / fe ] .",
    "figure [ fig : chem_evo ] ( _ bottom panel _ ) shows the result of [ fe / h ] as a function of redshift , in the same way as [ mg / fe ] .    in the figure , shown by curves",
    "are the chemical evolution models of quasar host galaxies with an initial burst of star formation and the time - invariant salpeter imf ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "three types of the sn ia lifetime are considered : a single lifetime model with @xmath581 gyr , a box - shaped @xmath582 distribution model with @xmath583@xmath584 gyr ( @xcite ) , and a power - law @xmath582 distribution model with @xmath585 for @xmath586@xmath584 gyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "for each of these three types , two values of the initial star formation redshift are considered : @xmath587 and 10 . in general ,",
    "the [ mg / fe ] ratio is initially maintained at a level as high as + 0.5 dex , reflecting the [ mg / fe ] ratio of the sn ii ejecta averaged with the time - invariant salpeter imf , and then the onset of sne ia with the enhanced fe supply causes a sudden fall and rise of theoretical curves of [ mg / fe ] and [ fe / h ] , respectively .",
    "after sne ia have ended their lives , a significant number of metal - poor intermediate - mass stars , which were formed initially from the metal - deficient gas with high [ mg / fe ] of pure sn ii origin , start to lose their envelope mass in the the surrounding gas .",
    "this can be seen as upward turn of [ mg / fe ] and downward turn of [ fe / h ] at @xmath588 . since the effect of mass loss becomes small with @xmath589",
    ", the theoretical curves of [ mg / fe ] and [ fe / h ] eventually reach their respective constant levels at @xmath590 .    the most important thing to note from figure [ fig : chem_evo ]",
    "is that our measurements of [ mg / fe ] and [ fe / h ] at redshift below @xmath591 lie along the theoretical curves . this means that unless the effect of later mass loss is taken into account in the models , the theoretical curves will continue to fall in [ mg / fe ] and rise in [ fe / h ] with decreasing @xmath589 and become unable to agree with our measurements at @xmath592",
    "therefore , the result in figure [ fig : chem_evo ] strongly suggests that the mass loss of intermediate - mass stars did occur in quasars .",
    "another point to note is that the predictions at @xmath593 largely differ from model to model , although they tend to converge at @xmath592 . from the inset diagram of figure [ fig : chem_evo ] (",
    "_ top panel _ )",
    ", we may safely say that the three models adopting @xmath594=(13 , 5 ) , ( 13 , 10 ) and ( 0.13 , 5 ) are rejected because @xmath24 values of those models are clearly larger than the other models .",
    "however , the convergence of models at low redshift prevents us from distinguishing which is the best model in the remaining three models from our sample of sdss quasars . for this reason ,",
    "high - redshift data are vitally important to overcome the indistinguishability among the models at @xmath595 . in the forthcoming paper",
    ", we will give a more complete discussion on the chemical evolution of the universe by also analyzing the available / data at @xmath596 .",
    "comparing our result with chemical evolution studies using other kind of objects , such as damped lyman-@xmath2 ( dla ) absorbers , is also of interest .",
    "as can be seen from figure 6 in @xcite , the metallicity of dla is sub - solar and decreases with increasing redshift , both of which are quite different from our result .",
    "however , it is not surprising given that blr clouds and dla absorbers are totally different objects ; the former likely reside in elliptical galaxies , while the latter are likely associated with star - forming galaxies .",
    "the difference between their host galaxies and star formation histories may account for the different behavior of chemical evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "several studies indicate that sub - dlas appear to be metal rich .",
    "for example , figure 11 in @xcite indicates that the sub - dla metallicity is super - solar at @xmath597 , which is consistent with our result .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite observed 21 quasars , which are known to contain sub - dlas in their spectra , with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "they found possible x - ray emission within @xmath598 of the background quasar in six cases . both of these results suggest that sub - dlas may be associated with agns .",
    "further investigation on this aspect would give insights into galaxy evolution .",
    "it remains , however , a challenge for future research to investigate the systematic errors of our new abundance diagnostics . in particular ,",
    "the assumptions worthy of mention for the fiducial quantities of a typical blr cloud include the gas density of @xmath138 and the covering factor of 0.13 .",
    "the fiducial gas density determines an anchor point of the grid shown in figures 14 and 15 in a vertical direction , resulting in a systematic error for [ mg / fe ] . on the other hand",
    ", the fiducial covering factor determines an anchor point of the grid in a diagonal direction , resulting in systematic errors for both [ mg / fe ] and [ fe / h ] .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the covering factor changes the estimated [ mg / fe ] and [ fe / h ] in the opposite direction , and is uniquely determined by comparing the chemical evolution models at low redshift .",
    "improving the accuracy of these estimates would require analysis of other emission lines together with and , which would make it possible to more fully investigate the chemical evolution of the universe with quasar emission lines .",
    "there has been a growing interest in a relationship between black hole mass and other quasar properties .",
    "we have checked whether the metallicity , measured by our method , depends on black hole mass or not .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : bhmass_metal ] . evidently , apparent correlation is not confirmed .",
    "we also plot the metallicity against the eddington ratio , but the result is similar .",
    "several authors report the existence of correlations between these quantities and the / flux ratio , which is frequently used as an indicator of blr metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite , ) . investigating",
    "the difference between their result and ours is beyond the scope of this paper , but it may be due to the density dependence of and/or , or different origination between highly ionized lines such as and and less highly ionized lines such as .",
    "for the purpose of inventing abundance diagnostics for a blr cloud , we selected 17,432 quasars from the sdss dr7 data and analyzed their  and  emission lines .",
    "in addition to their emission - line strengths , we measured their black hole masses and eddington ratios . as a result",
    ", an anticorrelation was found to exist between the /  flux ratio and the eddington ratio ; this is largely due to the anticorrelation between the  line strength and the eddington ratio .",
    "how and where  and  emission lines are created in a blr cloud was investigated by photoionization calculations using cloudy . taking into account the results of recent reverberation mapping studies , our calculations show that  and  are created in different regions of a blr cloud .",
    "this indicates that the /  flux ratio depends not only on the mg / fe abundance ratio but also on other non - abundance parameters .",
    "therefore , the /  flux ratio corrected for the non - abundance parameter has to be used for the abundance diagnostics .    in order to identify the main cause that accounts for the observed trends of the  and  emission - line strengths , extensive calculations were carried out by varying each of the non - abundance parameters in cloudy , such as blr gas density , column density , sed of the incident continuum , and microturbulence .",
    "it was found that the observed trends can be reproduced solely by changing the blr gas density .",
    "we have thus concluded that the trend of /  with the eddington ratio for our sample of sdss quasars requires the existence of anticorrelation between the blr gas density and the eddington ratio .",
    "accordingly , /  corrected for the density effect should reflect the abundance ratio more directly . to confirm this expectation ,",
    "the corrected ew()@xmath190 versus ew ( ) diagram is compared with calculations from cloudy , where the mg / fe abundance ratio and the metallicity [ fe / h ] are varied with other non - abundance parameters fixed to their fiducial values for the baseline model of a blr cloud .",
    "it is found that the data in the diagram are distributed within the calculated grid of mg / fe and [ fe / h ] for their reasonable respective ranges .",
    "this indicates that our abundance diagnostics works well for a blr cloud , and more reliable estimates of the gas density and covering factor for a blr cloud further enhance the accuracy of the resultant estimates of abundance parameter values .    for our sample of sdss quasars at @xmath595 ,",
    "we have derived @xmath599 \\sim -0.2 $ ] and @xmath600 \\sim + 0.5 $ ] on the average , which more or less agrees with chemical evolution models in which the effect of mass loss from initially formed metal - poor intermediate - mass stars is explicitly taken into account .",
    "these models , although tending to converge at @xmath595 , predict the diversity in [ mg / fe ] at @xmath593",
    ". therefore , high - redshift data are essential for distinguishing the best model from many plausible ones at @xmath595 .",
    "we will discuss this in the forthcoming paper .",
    "finally , we have compared the derived [ fe / h ] with black hole mass and the eddington ratio .",
    "contrary to the earlier studies using the / flux ratio as an indicator of blr metallicity , no apparent correlation between them is confirmed .",
    "although investing the origin of the difference is beyond the scope of this paper , it may be due to the density dependence of and/or , or different origination between highly ionized lines such as and and less highly ionized lines such as .",
