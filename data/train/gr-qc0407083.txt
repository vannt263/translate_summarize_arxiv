    "the carmeli cosmology @xcite is as revolutionary in its implementation as it is in its interpretation .",
    "the metric used by carmeli is unique in that it extends the number of dimensions of the universe by , either one dimension if we consider only the radial velocity of the galaxies in the hubble flow or by three if we consider all three velocity components .",
    "we will confine the discussion in this paper to only one extra dimension as does carmeli . in that case",
    "the line element in five dimensions becomes @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are @xmath5 potential functions to be determined .",
    "the time ( @xmath6 ) is measured in the observer s frame .",
    "the new dimension ( @xmath7 ) is the radial velocity of the galaxies in the expanding universe , in accordance with hubble flow .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 , the hubble - carmeli constant , is a constant at any epoch and its reciprocal ( designated @xmath9 ) is approximately the hubble constant @xmath10 .",
    "the line element represents a spherically symmetric isotropic universe , and the expansion is the result of _ spacevelocity _ expansion .",
    "the expansion is observed at a definite time and thus @xmath11 .",
    "taking into account @xmath12 ( isotropy condition ) and equation ( [ eqn : metric ] ) becomes @xmath13",
    "the solution of ( [ eqn : phasespacemetric ] ) ( given by equation b.38 and solved in section b.10 in @xcite ) is reproduced here .",
    "@xmath14     + the parameter @xmath15 is the mass / energy density of the universe expressed as a fraction of the critical or `` closure '' density , i.e. @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the averaged matter / energy density of the universe . in this model , @xmath18",
    "+ then ( [ eqn : phasespacederiv ] ) may be integrated exactly to get    @xmath19     + carmeli expanded ( [ eqn : phasespacesoln ] ) in the limit of small @xmath20 and small @xmath15 to get @xmath21    @xmath22    thus we can write the expansion in terms of normalized or natural units @xmath23 . equation ( [ eqn : phasespacesolncz ] ) is plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] for various values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "let us now re - write ( [ eqn : phasespacesoln ] ) in terms of natural units and for small @xmath26 but arbitrary @xmath15 , and we get @xmath27 + equation ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) produces curves almost indistinguishable from ( [ eqn : phasespacesolncz ] ) so this verifies that the approximations work well for @xmath28 .",
    "now let us consider what happens to the density of matter as we look back in the cosmos with redshift , @xmath26 .",
    "it was assumed in fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] that the value of @xmath15 is fixed for each curve .",
    "carmeli does this also in figure a4 , page 134 in @xcite .",
    "however , more correctly @xmath15 varies as a function of @xmath26 . for flat space",
    "we assume the following relation to hold , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a function of the redshift @xmath26 , and @xmath31 is the averaged matter density of the universe locally ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is then the local averaged matter density expressed as a fraction of `` closure '' density .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : densityeqn ] ) results from the fact that as the redshift increases the volume decreases as @xmath34 .",
    "notice at @xmath35 that the universe is 8 times smaller in volume and therefore 8 times more dense , that is , at @xmath36 , @xmath37 .    substituting ( [ eqn : densityeqn ] ) into ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) we get @xmath38",
    "+ carmeli was able to simulate the form of the @xmath39 redshift data of @xcite published in 1998 which announced an accelerating universe following the observations of @xcite .",
    "see figure a4 , page 134 in @xcite .",
    "but in fact he had predicted this in 1996 @xcite .",
    "so this means that carmeli assumed a value of total matter ( normal + dark matter ) density @xmath40 , which was the accepted value in 1998 .",
    "now let s plot ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) with @xmath40 and ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) with @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "this means that my modified equation ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) with @xmath41 gives the same result as carmeli s unapproximated equation ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) with his assumed value of @xmath40 , but that included dark matter .",
    "in fact , comparing ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) and ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) , a local matter density of only @xmath42 0.030.04 is necessary to have agreement .",
    "this effectively _ eliminates the need for the existence of dark matter _ on the cosmic scale .",
    "table i shows the critical data from the comparison at redshifts between @xmath43 and @xmath35 .",
    "it can be seen that the difference between the two equations over the domain of the measurements is much less significant than the fit to the data .",
    "if we assume @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 , since both are within measured parameters , we get closer agreement at smaller redshifts but worse near @xmath35 .",
    "+ in any case ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) and ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) must be modified as @xmath46 to allow for relativistic effects , by replacing @xmath47 with the relativistic form @xmath48 . therefore we can re - write ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) and ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) respectively as @xmath49 and @xmath50 where the varying matter density has been taken into account . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturalr ] ) and ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturalrd ] ) are compared .",
    "the density approximation may be no longer valid past @xmath35 , because it is shown below that the vacuum energy term dominates and the universe is far from spatially flat .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "based on the above analysis we can rewrite equation a.54 from @xcite for @xmath10 as    @xmath51    which according to equation a.51 from @xcite may be further generalized without approximation , and using the relativistic form of the redshift .",
    "still that equation may only be approximate for @xmath52 because of the density assumptions .",
    "however it becomes    @xmath53    where @xmath54 .    both ( [ eqn : hubbleparam ] ) and ( [ eqn : hubbleparamgen ] ) have been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , and for carmeli s chosen value of @xmath55 at @xmath35 in ( [ eqn : hubbleparam ] ) yields @xmath56 ( very close to carmeli s value ) but ( [ eqn : hubbleparamgen ] ) yields @xmath57 .",
    "this means without the small z approximation the value of @xmath9 is reduced when compared to that in @xcite .",
    "the vacuum or dark energy parameter @xmath58 does not appear explicitly in carmeli s model .",
    "it is only by a comparison with f - l models can an assignment be made .",
    "on page 138 of @xcite by comparing with the standard model it is shown that @xmath59 , therefore we can write    @xmath60    from ( [ eqn : darkenergy ] ) it is expected that using the unapproximated equation ( [ eqn : hubbleparamgen ] ) for @xmath10 the value of @xmath58 will be larger than carmeli s value using the form of ( [ eqn : phasespacesolncz ] ) .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows the values for the vacuum energy density @xmath58 ( broken curve ) and for the total energy density @xmath61 ( solid curve ) as a function of redshift , @xmath26 . from ( [ eqn : darkenergy ] ) it follows that as the universe expands the total density tends to the vacuum energy density @xmath62 ( since @xmath63 ) .",
    "this means a totally 3d spatially flat universe in a totally relaxed state .    for small @xmath26",
    "the total density becomes    @xmath64    it follows from ( [ eqn : darkenergysmz ] ) that for @xmath41 at z = 0 the total density @xmath65 .",
    "this value is consistent with carmeli s result of @xmath66 .",
    "however , it follows from ( [ eqn : densityeqn ] ) and ( [ eqn : darkenergysmz ] ) that the universe will always be open , @xmath67 as it expands . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] the total density @xmath61 is always greater than unity and as the universe expands , it asymptotically approaches unity  therefore a spatially flat universe devoid of dark matter .",
    "the 5d brane world of moshe carmeli has been has been applied to the expanding accelerating universe and the redshift distance relation has been generalised for redshifts up to at least @xmath68 .",
    "it has been found that if a certain form of the dependence of baryonic matter density on redshift is assumed then the resulting distance - redshift relation will approximate the form of the data of the high-@xmath26 supernova teams without the need for dark matter .",
    "even though it does not explicitly appear in the carmeli _ spacevelocity _ metric , the vacuum energy contribution to gravity , @xmath58 tends to unity as a function of decreasing redshift . also since the baryonic matter density @xmath63 as the universe expands , the total mass / energy density @xmath69",
    "this indicates that the universe , though always open because @xmath67 , is asymptotically expanding towards a spatially flat state .",
