    "preparation and control of the state of quantum systems is at the heart of a variety of applications in sensing , precision measurements , and quantum information science .",
    "while cooling and damping are instrumental mechanisms to prepare a known , pure state , e.g. , an atomic ground state , measurements and their accompanying back action have turned out to be sometimes a more practical , efficient , and versatile tool .",
    "numerous applications of heralding schemes as well as measurement and feedback schemes have been proposed and demonstrated in laboratories , and they are gradually becoming a significant component in our toolbox for state preparation and control .",
    "thus , atomic ensembles @xcite and remote pairs of individual ions @xcite have been prepared in entangled states by detection of transmitted or spontaneously emitted photons , and a superconducting qubit has been prepared in its ground state by a state measurement ( followed by a unitary inversion pulse , in case of an excited state outcome of the measurement ) @xcite . in conjunction with entangling interactions , heralding may substantially increase the degree of entanglement @xcite or the fidelity of a quantum gate at the cost of an only near unity success probability @xcite .",
    "in this article we consider the special case of a coherently excited two - level system that we may only access through the detection of radiation emitted during the spontaneous decay of the system into its ground state .",
    "we assume this decay to occur into a broadband continuum of radiation modes and , hence , we have no means to suppress the excited state decay rate @xmath0 .",
    "the average excitation probability therefore follows the exponential decay law @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the initial excited state population .",
    "however , as the emitted quantum field is entangled with the state of the emitter , detection of the radiation causes a back action on this state .",
    "a similar effect exists in classical probability theory , where a light bulb may have an exponentially decaying survival probability , while any observed light bulb is in fact fully functional until it suddenly becomes defect . in both the classical and the quantum case ,",
    "the observer can not control or decide the outcome of the heralding measurement , but for quantum systems , the observer has the freedom to choose between different observables and hence to choose between different types of measurement back action on the emitter .",
    "this possibility was identified as a _ steering _",
    "property by schrdinger @xcite , and has been the subject of considerable recent theoretical and experimental interest @xcite .    using a stochastic unraveling , we calculate the quantum state conditioned on the measurement of light emitted during the decay , and we assess the possibility that the emitter thus evolves from a partially to a fully excited state .",
    "we shall compare the situation of ( i ) quantum jumps associated with photon counting , ( ii ) quantum state diffusion associated with homodyne detection with a strong , classical local oscillator , and ( iii ) discrete jump - like behavior of the emitter associated with interference measurements with a weak local oscillator field .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to a broadband radiation reservoir and conditioned on detection of the signal emitted into the reservoir modes . in section 3",
    ", we discuss how the measurement of the emitted signal combined with a local oscillator field of the correct amplitude can herald a quantum jump of the emitter into its excited state , and we characterize the probability for this process to occur . in section 4 ,",
    "we extend the analysis to a strategy where the local oscillator amplitude is adapted according to previous measurement events , and in section 5 , we conclude with a summary and brief discussion of the relation between our work and the steering of quantum states .",
    "in this article we consider a two - state quantum system coupled by electric or magnetic dipole interaction to a freely propagating quantized radiation field .",
    "the excited state @xmath3 has the energy @xmath4 above the ground state @xmath5 with energy @xmath6 , and we assume an emitter superposition state and no photons at time @xmath7 , @xmath8 . following the wigner - weisskopf analysis of atomic decay , the wavefunction of the atom and the quantized radiation field at time @xmath9",
    "can then be written as @xmath10 where the first two terms represent the state of the emitter with no photons present in the quantized field , while the last term represents the ground state emitter in the presence of a one - photon state , which has been expanded on , e.g. , a set of traveling wave modes @xmath11 with photon energies @xmath12 .",
    "according to ( [ eq : systemreservoircouplingperturbation ] ) , the atomic coherences and populations decay due to the coupling to the quantized field .",
    "if we assume that previously emitted photons do not affect the future atomic dynamics ( markov approximation ) , we can derive a master equation for the system density matrix @xmath13 , according to which the excited state population decays exponentially , @xmath14 , while , in a frame rotating at @xmath15 , the coherences decay according to @xmath16 .",
    "the last term in ( [ eq : systemreservoircouplingperturbation ] ) represents the return of the population decay of the excited state into the ground state , @xmath17 .",
    "while the rate equations for the density matrix elements describe the average , unobserved dynamics of the emitter , detection of the emitted radiation heralds a different , stochastic evolution @xcite .",
    "this is most easily appreciated by considering the effect of photon counting on the state described by ( [ eq : systemreservoircouplingperturbation ] ) at time @xmath18 : detection of no photon causes a projection onto the first two components of ( [ eq : systemreservoircouplingperturbation ] ) ( with no photons in the field ) and effectively leads to a continuous reduction of the excited state amplitude .",
    "detection of a photon similarly projects the system onto the last term of ( [ eq : systemreservoircouplingperturbation ] ) , i.e. the emitter is subject to a quantum jump into the ground state , accompanied by the annihilation of the photon in case of normal photon counting .    by considering the full time evolution of an emitter prepared in the initial state @xmath19",
    ", we arrive at the following simple dynamics : during time intervals with no photon detection , the excited state amplitude decays exponentially as @xmath20 and , after renormalization of the state , the conditional excited state population takes the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the initial ground state population .",
    "the detection of a photon in a time interval @xmath23 has the time dependent probability @xmath24 , and one can show that a fraction @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) of the emitters reach the ground state with ( without ) a quantum jump . the no - jump and the different jump trajectories precisely average to yield the conventional exponential decay curve , but in none of the trajectories will the excited state population exceed its initial value .",

    "the coherent state of radiation @xmath29 is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , and the photon flux in the beam is given by the mean value @xmath32 .",
    "the annihilation of a photon from the emitter signal is associated with a quantum jump of the emitter , as described by the operator @xmath33 , where the pre - factor leads to the predicted counting rate @xmath34 .    as we are mixing the fields on a beam splitter of intensity transmission coefficient @xmath35 ,",
    "the annihilation of a photon in either of the output ports is governed by a superposition of the annihilation operators of the input modes , @xmath36 where we have chosen real reflection and transmission amplitudes without loss of generality .",

    "the resulting dynamics becomes a diffusion process in hilbert space and can also be represented by a stochastic differential equation of ito or stratonovich form @xcite .",
    "we shall not write this equation here but merely note that if the initial state amplitudes and the local oscillator field amplitude are all real , this will remain true for the entire evolution of the system . the two - level emitter dynamics will therefore follow a great circle on the bloch sphere , where the decay on average drives the system towards the south pole ( ground state ) while the stochastic measurement back action causes diffusion of the lattitude coordinate , see fig .",

    "the figure is suggestive of a protocol that adapts @xmath35 with time .",
    "this may be possible by using e.g. a mach - zender interferometer with adjustable path lengths as a beam splitter .",

    "in figs .  [ fig : dynamicprotocol ] and  [ fig : dynamicprotocolvariablemu ] we observe a rather large gap between the success probability ( [ eq : p1 ] ) and the upper limit inferred by the no - jump probability ( [ eq : nojumpprob ] ) and by energy conservation .",
    "this gap is associated with the probability for other possible detector outcomes , namely the detection of one or more clicks by detector b.    in the same manner as we calculated the probability that the first detection is by detector a at time t , we may also obtain the probability that the first detection is by detector b. rather than discarding the ensuing dynamics , we can adapt the local oscillator amplitude such that a subsequent a detection will yield the excited state .    following the analysis in the previous subsections , we are able to calculate the probability that no jumps occur after the b - detection and , by integrating over the time of the b - detection , the total probability @xmath82 of reaching the emitter ground state after a single b - jump",
    ". we may proceed along the same line of thought and evaluate the probability @xmath83 of reaching the ground state after @xmath84 b - jumps and no further jumps . when these probabilities are subtracted from unity in a cumulative manner ,",
    "@xmath85 , they yield a increasingly tighter constraint on the remaining probability to herald the perfectly excited emitter state , see the dashed curves in fig .  [",

    "we observe in the figure that the inclusion of a single b - jump ( @xmath86 ) strengthens the constraint set by the initial excitation @xmath25 and energy conservation .",
    "similar to the previous subsection , we may also evaluate the probability @xmath87 that , after @xmath88 ( none or several ) b - jumps , the system undergoes an a - jump and heralds the fully excited state .",
    "these probabilities all contribute to the success probability of the protocol .",
    "we have evaluated expressions for these probabilities in terms of integrals over the heralding event times up to @xmath89 as well as for @xmath90 b - jumps followed by no - jump dynamics . the rather lengthy expression for @xmath91",
    "is given as ( [ appeq : p_ba ] ) in the appendix and presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : dynamicmu ] .",
    "we observe that the gap between the achievable and the excluded probabilities gradually closes when we include more terms in the accumulated probability @xmath92 and in the excluded probability @xmath93 , in particular for the lower beam splitter transmissivity .     for @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( left to right panels ) .",

    "in summary , we have studied how the monitoring of the excitation of a broadband radiation reservoir affects the possible dynamical evolution trajectories of a quantum emitter .",
    "the monitoring does not change the average decay of the system , but it determines the type of evolution of the system , as illustrated by the possibility to sometimes herald a fully excited state .",
    "the use of measurements to herald specific states of a quantum system sees widespread application , and we have in this article demonstrated how one may optimize the success probability of remotely preparing an excited state by adapting the measurement scheme during continuous probing .",
    "we illustrated this idea by homodyne detection using a weak local oscillator with an adaptive coherent field strength , and , as we showed , the beam - splitter parameter governing the mixing of the emitted field and the local oscillator field may be varied to further improve the scheme .",
    "we have assumed perfect collimation , lossless transmission and unit detection efficiency of the emitted signal . for imperfect homodyne ( and heterodyne ) detection , the quantum trajectories of a decaying system explore mixed states @xcite , and one may not herald the pure excited state with certainty .",
    "in that situation , one may instead investigate the probability that the heralded mixed state has an excited state population exceeding a certain critical value , e.g. , above the initial excitation of the system .",
    "finally , let us recall that our protocol relies on the entanglement of the emitter and the spontaneously emitted radiation , and that the apparent paradoxical excitation of the emitter by the monitoring of its decay reflects the non - local measurement back action , as criticized by einstein and schrdinger in the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "schrdinger associated the term _ steering _",
    "@xcite to the way that an observer affects the dynamics of one system by the choice of measurement the observer performs on another , possibly remote one . as demonstrated by wiseman",
    "et al @xcite , the steering property can be quantified and unambiguously verified in experiments . as also shown by wiseman",
    "et al @xcite , one may quantify different measurement schemes , e.g. counting and homodyne detection , by their ability to steer the emitter state , and how that ability is degraded for reduced detector efficiencies .",
