    "the chern - simons theory of a knot in @xmath0 @xcite is related to topological strings in @xmath1 and , through a conifold transition , to topological strings in the resolved conifold @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "let @xmath3 be a connection on @xmath0 for the gauge group @xmath4 and @xmath5 be a representation of @xmath6 .",
    "the chern - simons action functional is the following ( where @xmath7 is the coupling constant ) @xmath8 the partition function of this theory is defined by path - integrals in physics @xmath9 let @xmath10 be a framed , oriented knot . in physics , the normalized vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the holonomy around @xmath13 .",
    "this definition also relies on path - integral . in mathematics , for example , when @xmath5 is the fundamental representation of @xmath4 , @xmath14 is related to the homfly polynomial @xmath15 of @xmath13 as below @xmath16 where @xmath17    under the large - n duality and the conifold transition , the gauge theory invariant @xmath14 is conjecturally related to the open gromov - witten theory of @xmath18 @xcite with lagrangian boundary condition @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath13 is an unknot , the conjecture can be precisely formulated as the famous mario - vafa formula concerning hodge integrals and is later proved @xcite .",
    "although the general construction of @xmath19 out of @xmath13 other than unknots was not very clear in the beginning , later the construction @xcite provided recipes for @xmath19 . in this paper , we follow diaconescu - shende - vafa s construction @xcite for an algebraic knot @xmath13 , which produces a maslov index @xmath20 non - compact lagrangian @xmath21 in @xmath22 .    with @xmath23 ,",
    "open gromov - witten theory is usually difficult to define .",
    "when @xmath13 is an unknot , @xmath19 belongs to a class of lagrangians called aganagic - vafa branes @xcite ( harvey - lawson type lagrangian ) .",
    "the open gromov - witten invariants for @xmath23 in this situation are defined in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath13 is a torus knot , i.e. a knot that can be realized on a real torus in @xmath0 , one can still use the localization technique to define such open gromov - witten invariants @xcite . in @xcite , diaconescu - shende - vafa also prove the conjecture on the correspondence between homfly polynomials and open gromov - witten invariants .    the topological a - type string theory on @xmath22",

    "when the lagrangian @xmath19 in @xmath22 is an aganagic - vafa brane , i.e. the conifold transition of an unknot , all genus gromov - witten open - closed invariants are obtained from eynard - orantin s topological recursion @xcite . in @xcite , brini - eynard - mario conjecture that using a modified spectral curve for a given torus knot @xmath24 for coprime @xmath25 , one gets all genus open gromov - witten invariants for the conifold transition @xmath26 of @xmath24 , and recovers homfly polynomials of @xmath24 .",

    "on the other hand , the spectral curve @xmath30 , roughly speaking , is the following curve @xmath31 together with a superpotential ( holomorphic function ) @xmath32 on @xmath30 , where @xmath33 eynard - orantin s recursion is a recursive algorithm that produces all genus open invariants of this spectral curve ( see section [ sec : eo - recursion ] ) . from the recursion",

    "gu - jockers - klemm - soroush argue that the b - model spectral curve of a knot is defined by the _ augmentation polynomial_. if we choose such augmentation polynomial , although more complicated than the equation of @xmath30 , we do not need to discard terms whose degrees are not divisible by @xmath45 .",
    "the authors hope proving brini - eynard - mario s conjecture will lead a way to the prediction by the augmentation variety .",
    "an experimental computation of augmentation polynomial by localization of open gw invariants is in @xcite .      in section [ sec : transition ]",

    "we also express the generating functions for these invariants in graph sums . in section [ sec : spectral ] we discuss the b - model mirror to @xmath23 as a spectral curve @xmath30 , and express the eynard - orantin invariants in terms of graph sums .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : mirror ] we prove the all genus mirror symmetry between @xmath23 and @xmath30 , based on the localization computation on disk invariants , genus @xmath20 mirror theorem and graph sum formulae .",

    "our goal is to construct a lagrangian @xmath19 in the resolved conifold @xmath22 , which in some sense corresponds to the knot @xmath13 under the conifold transition .",
