    "as it is well - known , the gravitational field is the only interaction that has not been successfully fitted into the general framework of quantum theory .",
    "the theory describing this interaction , to the best of our current knowledge , is einstein s general theory of relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the experimental tests passed by gr are impressive , however , it has its own limitations in a more fundamental level .",
    "for instance , it suffers from notorious divergence problems and an ill ultraviolet ( uv ) behavior due to its nonrenormalizability .",
    "these issues suggest that gr is a purely low - energy or large - distance approximation to some more fundamental underlying model : a quantum theory of gravity . a good formulation of such a theory",
    "would be expected to solve the problems mentioned above , having gr as its classical limit .    in this context",
    ", petr hoava proposed an interesting approach whose formulation seems to provide a better starting point in the search to understand quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the central idea of his theory is to combine gravity with the concept of anisotropic scaling between space and time , motivated by the recent developments in the study of condensed matter systems .",
    "based on this principle , higher spatial - derivative correction terms may be added to the standard einstein - hilbert action such as different powers of the spatial curvature .",
    "this improves the uv behavior of the graviton propagator but at the cost of giving up the lorentz invariance as a fundamental symmetry of the theory . instead of that it is expected to emerge as an accidental symmetry in the infrared ( ir ) regime where",
    "general covariance must be restored .    in the minimal version of the theory the nature of the modifications",
    "is governed by the gravitational analog of the `` detailed balance '' principle , frequently used in the study of the dynamics of nonequilibrium systems , and the so - called `` projectability condition '' which restricts the lapse function to be a function of time only @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to generalize this formulation by relaxing any or both of these conditions .",
    "this has lead to the projectable and nonprojectable versions of the theory @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that hoava s first proposal and some of its extensions suffer from several issues related to a badly behaved scalar mode @xcite .",
    "however , it has desirable features which make it worth exploring .",
    "many aspects of the theory have been discussed in the literature , particularly , cosmological and black hole solutions have been obtained @xcite .",
    "many issues of cosmology arising from it have also been analyzed ( see , for example @xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "models which could provide information about the quantum properties of this theory would be of interest . for this purpose , the simplest models one can build are those depending only on time : quantum cosmological models . we choose the kantowski - sachs ( ks ) model @xcite as it has been extensively studied in the framework of gr where it is associated through a well - known diffeomorphism with the schwarzschild and schwarzschild ( anti)-de sitter black holes @xcite .",
    "a wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation for this model is derived in the context of the minimal theory proposed by hoava .",
    "we study the solutions to this equation in the uv regime for different values of the parameter @xmath0 of the theory , comparing them with the corresponding solutions derived in the infrared regime ( gr ) by constructing the respective gaussian - weighted wave packets in these two limits .",
    "even though @xmath0 is a free parameter susceptible to quantum corrections @xcite , a particularly interesting result is obtained when @xmath0 takes its relativistic value @xmath1 , where the minisuperspace variables exchange their role in this limit compared with their usual gr behavior .",
    "this uv behavior is similar for other values of @xmath0 too .",
    "this suggests that for other quantum models , in the realm of hoava - lifshitz gravity , not only those related with quantum cosmology , we should expect a very different behavior in the uv limit compared with the one in the ir regime ( gr ) .",
    "we also look at the classical solutions by means of a wkb method .",
    "it is observed that for the specific case @xmath1 , a generalized ks metric is obtained which differs from the usual ks solution in gr by an additional term arising from the higher - order spatial curvature terms in the action and which dominates the behavior for very small values of the time parameter as expected .",
    "we show the behavior of this generalized metric by comparing it with the one in einstein s gravity .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] we review the general features of gravity models with anisotropic scaling and their hamiltonian formulation . in sec .",
    "[ ksgr ] we briefly review the minisuperspace framework of quantum cosmology . here",

    "[ kshl ] we derive the wdw equation for this model within the framework of the minimal theory proposed by hoava .",
    "in particular , the uv regime is analyzed and it is shown that the behavior of the wave packet is completely different compared with the one observed in gr .",
    "then a wkb approach is also performed to the generalized wdw equation and the corresponding classical equation is analytically solved for the case @xmath1 in order to obtain a generalized ks metric .",
    "we discuss its general physical properties in comparison with those of the standard ks solution of gr .",

    "[ conclusions ] is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in gravity theories with anisotropic scaling the degree of anisotropy between the space and time coordinates is characterized by a dynamical critical exponent @xmath2 @xcite , such that @xmath3 the gauge symmetries are those spacetime diffeomorphisms that preserve a preferred foliation @xmath4 of the spacetime manifold @xmath5 by fixed time slices , known as foliation - preserving diffeomorphisms @xmath6 , generated by the infinitesimal transformations @xmath7 thus , the spacetime manifold is equipped with a causal structure compatible with the preferred role of time implied by the anisotropic scaling . in this context",
    ", it results convenient to consider the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) decomposition of spacetime and to construct the action in terms of the spatial metric @xmath8 , the shift vector @xmath9 and the lapse function @xmath10 @xcite . with all these ingredients the most general action of this class of gravity models in @xmath11 dimensions takes the form @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath0 are coupling constants , and @xmath14 is the extrinsic curvature tensor of the preferred time foliation defined by @xmath15 the first two terms in the action represent the most general kinetic term invariant under @xmath6 , and @xmath16 is an arbitrary potential term built on @xmath8 and its spatial derivatives including all those terms compatible with @xmath6 and depending on the desired value of @xmath2 .",
    "originally @xmath17 was chosen by power counting arguments ensuring a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath13 pursuing renormalizability @xcite . as a first attempt",
    ", hoava restricted @xmath16 to satisfy the so - called `` detailed balance '' and projectability conditions .",
    "the former limiting the number of independent terms by constructing @xmath16 as the square of the equations of motion of an action in one lower dimension , and the latter restricting the lapse field to be a function of time only @xcite .",
    "there seems to be no physical arguments behind these conditions , however , they allow a mathematically consistent formulation of gravity with anisotropic scaling preserving the essential properties of this new class of gravity models",
    ".    then the action of this nonrelativistic theory , under all these considerations , in @xmath18 dimensions is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are constant parameters and @xmath23 is the cotton tensor defined by @xmath24 comparing with the einstein - hilbert action in the adm formalism , the speed of light , newton s constant and the cosmological constant emerge as @xmath25 furthermore the requirement that this action be equivalent to the standard einstein - hilbert action in the ir limit requires that the running constant @xmath0 takes its relativistic value @xmath1 .",
    "it is also important to note from the former expressions that for @xmath26 we must have a negative cosmological constant incompatible with observations .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , this problem can be solved by taking an analytical continuation of the constants @xmath20 and @xmath27 , namely @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this changes the sign of the potential term in the action , leaving the kinetic term intact and with emergent speed of light @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the cosmological constant is , as desired , positive for @xmath26 .      as already pointed out in @xcite a hamiltonian formulation for gravity with anisotropic scaling results particularly natural because of the @xmath18 split of spacetime . in this sense",
    "the metric fields become canonical variables and the hamiltonian for the theory may be written , as in gr , as a sum of constraints , namely , @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the hamiltonian and momentum constraints , respectively , given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the canonical momenta conjugate to the spatial metric and @xmath36 is the generalized dewitt metric and @xmath37 its inverse .",
    "note that these hamiltonian and momentum constraints preserve the same structure of the gr ones in the adm formalism @xcite .",
    "however , if the projectability condition is satisfied the hamiltonian constraint becomes nonlocal and it turns out that the constraint algebra of the theory is slightly different from that of gr @xcite . in this case one must consider the spatially integrated constraint @xmath38 here we may proceed to quantize the model following the dirac s recipe assuming the canonical variables obey usual commutation relations and imposing the constraints on the state vector .",
    "so , the quantum version of the integral constraint @xmath39 together with the momentum constraints @xmath33 will play the role of the wheeler - dewitt equations @xmath40 in sec . [ kshl : qm ] we implement this quantization program to the ks cosmological model within the minimal version of hoava - lifshitz gravity described by the action , with the aim to explore the quantum properties of this theory . for this purpose",
    "we review how this in done in the context of gr and derive the already known results for the ks model in the next section .",
    "let us then start by reviewing the well - known quantum and classical properties of the ks universe , which is one of the simplest homogenous and anisotropic models , in the context of gr .",
    "the metric for this model is @xmath41 which is a solution of the einstein field equations with cosmological constant . a convenient parametrization for this metric due to misner @xcite is @xmath42 where @xmath10 represents the lapse function , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 parametrize the spatial - metric components of this anisotropic model . in the quantum gravity context",
    "one must allow the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 to be completely arbitrary , but in the study of homogeneous universes , the metric depends only on the time parameter . as a consequence , a model with a finite - dimensional configuration space arises known as minisuperspace and whose variables are the three - metric components , parametrized in this case by @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the minisuperspace quantization of the ks model , following the lines of sec .",
    "[ hamiltonianformulation ] , comes through the implementation of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints on the state vector .",
    "this has been carried out in @xcite where the particular parametrization was conveniently chosen so that the corresponding wdw equation for this model with a particular factor ordering adopts the form of a klein - gordon equation @xmath45\\bigg\\ } \\psi(\\omega,\\beta )    \\\\ & = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for this model the momentum constraints are satisfied identically @xcite .",
    "so , the analysis of this model can be performed in a similar manner as in standard quantum mechanics with @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the minisuperspace `` coordinates '' chosen to describe the ks quantum cosmological model .",
    "the solution to this equation with @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a separation constant and @xmath49 are the modified bessel functions ( macdonald functions ) of imaginary order .",
    "although this wave function is , in general , not normalizable , we may analyze its physical properties by constructing a wave packet @xcite .",
    "this is done in sec .",
    "[ kshl : qm ] in order to analyze the quantum solutions obtained in hoava - lifshitz gravity and to compare them with the ones derived in gr .",
    "now in order to obtain the ( semi)classical analog of the wdw equation we proceed to apply the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) method @xcite .",
    "for this we assume separability of the wave function in its arguments @xmath44 and @xmath43 and propose the ansatz @xmath50}.\\ ] ] the wkb approximation is reached in the limit @xmath51 then substituting this form of the wave function back into together with the conditions on the derivatives of the @xmath52-functions we obtain the einstein - hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath53 = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , we identify @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 these standard identifications in the wkb procedure lead us to obtain the classical equation @xmath57=0.\\ ] ] it is only up to this classical level that we can identify @xmath43 and @xmath44 as functions of time .",
    "then , making use of the misner parametrization , taking @xmath58 and identifying @xmath59 , we get the equation @xmath60 whose solution is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an integration constant .",
    "this brings us back to the metric if we take @xmath63 .",
    "so as expected the wkb method applied to the wdw equation gives the classical equation , and its solution is the same as the one obtained through the classical einstein s field equations .",
    "[ wphl : subfigures1 ]",
    "now let us proceed similarly to study the ks model within the framework of the minimal theory proposed by hoava .",
    "we consider here the original action as well as its analytical continuation described in sec .",
    "[ theaction ] . in this case",
    ", quantization comes through the implementation of the spatially integrated hamiltonian constraint on the state vector .",
    "so , the resulting wdw equations are @xmath64\\bigg\\}\\psi_{1,2}(\\omega,\\beta)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 stand for the wave functions associated with the @xmath67 and @xmath68 signs in the potential corresponding to the original and the analytically continued actions respectively .",
    "these quantum equations considerably differ from the usual wdw equation but notice that for this particular model with @xmath69 and making use of the expressions in units such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 , they reduce to up to the first two terms of the potential in .",
    "so the ir limit gives the same behavior obtained in gr .",
    "however , there is an additional term in the potential coming from the higher - order terms in and which is responsible for the uv behavior of the model .",
    "thus , since an analytical solution for this pair of equations is difficult to be found let us consider the uv limit where this last term in the potential dominates .",
    "the reduced wdw equations are @xmath72\\psi_{1,2}(\\omega , \\beta ) = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solutions to these equations are given in terms of macdonald and bessel functions , respectively @xmath73 with @xmath48 a separation constant . despite the bulky form of this solution",
    ", @xmath74 takes a familiar structure for the particular case @xmath69 where the wave function is @xmath75 this particular solution resembles the one obtained in gr , but it results that the roles of the minisuperspace variables are now interchanged .",
    "so , a simple but completely different physical result arises .",
    "it is noteworthy here that for some of the results in this paper we have considered that the free parameter @xmath0 takes the specific value @xmath1 .",
    "however , @xmath0 represents a dynamical coupling constant which could run under the renormalization group flow since it is not protected by any symmetry .",
    "then it is expected that in the uv regime @xmath0 runs away from its desired ir fixed point @xmath1 , where gr should be recovered @xcite . however , using this value is not problematic and can be used for simplicity with the purpose of analyzing the quantum properties of the model .",
    "[ wphl : subfigures2 ]    in order to see the consequences of the uv corrections more clearly , a general solution may be obtained by superposition of the quantum cosmological solutions of the wdw equation with an appropriate amplitude in the sense of the principle of constructive interference @xcite .",

    "this integral is performed numerically for the specific values @xmath80 and @xmath81 with @xmath82 , and for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "not only are we interested to see the influence of the higher - order spatial curvature terms in the action , but also we want to study the behavior of the probability depending on the values of the @xmath44 and @xmath43 variables .",
    "figure [ wphorava ] shows the variation of the square of the wave packet magnitude @xmath83 as a function of the minisuperspace variables @xmath44 and @xmath43 for the case @xmath69 in the uv region .",
    "it can be seen that in this case there is only one absolute maximum representing the most probable state of the universe around @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in contrast ,",
    "[ wpeinstein ] shows the already known ir behavior , the gr one @xcite , described by the corresponding solution .",

    "in some sense they are opposed since the minisuperspace variables switch their role between these two limits , uv and ir .",

    ", we can see that the universe would live in a very different quantum state when its behavior is dominated by the higher - order terms in .",
    "even though this particular exchange in the behavior between the minisuperspace variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the ir and uv regions for @xmath1 happens for this specific model , this result seems to indicate that for other minisuperspaces and even for more general models , one should expect significant quantum physical differences among the ir and uv regions .",
    "it is worth to mention here that the minisuperspace construction is a procedure to define quantum cosmological models in the search to describe the quantum behavior of the universe at its very early stages . by defining these models ,",
    "one necessarily freezes out degrees of freedom , so that these are only simple and probably approximate models of quantum gravity .",
    "nevertheless , this procedure has allowed us to construct a simple quantum cosmological model in the framework of hoava - lifshitz gravity and to perform a study of the early universe analyzing the properties of the corresponding quantum solutions . in this context",
