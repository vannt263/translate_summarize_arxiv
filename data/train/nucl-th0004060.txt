    "effective field theory ( eft ) is a technique commonly used in particle physics to deal with problems involving widely - separated energy scales .",
    "it facilitates the systematic separation of the effects of high - energy physics from those of low - energy physics . in strong - interaction physics",
    "the low - energy effective theory is chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt )  @xcite .",
    "here the low - energy physics is that of nucleons and pions interacting with each other in a way that respects the spontaneously - broken approximate chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "higher - energy effects of qcd appear in @xmath0pt as non - renormalizable contact operators . in this way",
    "the eft provides a long - wavelength approximation to the amplitudes for various hadronic processes .",
    "it yields amplitudes which can be thought of as expansions in the ratio of nucleon or probe momenta ( denoted here by @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and the pion mass to the scale of chiral - symmetry breaking , @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath3 is of order @xmath4 , and so such an expansion in @xmath5 , with    @xmath6    provides a controlled way to calculate hadronic processes , as long as @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not too large . in light nuclei",
    "the typical momentum of a bound nucleon is of order @xmath7 or less , and so we should be able to calculate the response of such nuclei to low - energy probes using @xmath0pt , thereby providing systematically - improvable , model - independent descriptions of these reactions .",
    "in this paper i will describe some recent work in this direction .",
    "section 2 outlines the expansion which @xmath0pt gives for these processes , while sections 3 and 4 sketch this expansion s use for electron - deuteron scattering and compton scattering on the deuteron .",
    "consider an elastic scattering process on the deuteron whose amplitude we wish to compute  .",
    "if @xmath8 is the transition operator for this process then the amplitude in question is simply latexmath:[$\\langle \\psi| \\hat{o }    function . in this section ,",
    "we follow weinberg  @xcite , and divide the formulation of a systematic expansion for this amplitude into two parts : the expansion for @xmath8 , and the construction of @xmath10 .",
    "chiral perturbation theory gives a systematic expansion for @xmath8 of the form    @xmath11    where we have labeled the contributions to @xmath8 by their order @xmath12 in the small parameter @xmath5 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) .",
    "this expansion is partially motivated by the idea of a long - wavelength limit , where distances smaller than @xmath13 are not resolved .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : expansion ] ) is an operator statement , and the nucleon momentum operator @xmath14 appears on the right - hand side .",
    "thus , one might worry about the unboundedness of this quantum - mechanical operator . however , once we take matrix elements of @xmath8 to construct the physical amplitude for the process in question the only quantities which appear are objects like @xmath15 . for weakly - bound systems like the deuteron",
    "these expectation values are generically small compared to @xmath16 .",
    "the procedure to construct @xmath17 begins with writing down the vertices appearing in the chiral lagrangian up to order @xmath12 .",
    "one then draws all of the two - body , two - nucleon - irreducible , feynman graphs for the process of interest which are of chiral order @xmath18 .",
    "the rules for calculating the chiral order of a particular graph are :    * each nucleon propagator scales like @xmath19 ; * each loop contributes @xmath20 ; * graphs in which both particles participate in the reaction acquire a factor of @xmath21 ; * each pion propagator scales like @xmath22 ; * each vertex from the @xmath12th - order piece of the chiral lagrangian contributes @xmath18 .    in this way",
    "we see that more complicated graphs , involving two - body mechanisms , and/or higher - order vertices , and/or more loops , are suppressed by powers of the small parameter @xmath5 .",
    "there remains the problem of constructing a deuteron wave function which is consistent with the operator @xmath8 .",
    "the proposal of weinberg was to construct a @xmath0pt expansion as per eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion ] ) for the @xmath23 potential @xmath24 , and then solve the schrdinger equation to find the deuteron ( or other nuclear ) wave function  @xcite .",
    "recent calculations have shown that the @xmath23 phase shifts can be understood , and deuteron bound - state static properties reliably computed , with wave functions derived from @xmath0pt in this way  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is that there is no _ a priori _ reason within @xmath0pt to iterate @xmath24 to all orders , since the loop corrections which are responsible for generating the deuteron bound state are , in principle , higher - order effects in the eft . in marked contrast to @xmath0pt in the one - nucleon sector , weinberg s application of @xmath0pt to nuclei",
    "has power - counting only for the potential , and not for the @xmath23 scattering amplitude .",
    "the most notable attempt to remedy this deficiency was made by kaplan , savage , and wise , in ref .",
    "i will not discuss these issues further here , but instead refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a survey of the state of play . in this work",
    "i focus on the @xmath0pt expansion for the operators @xmath8 and use wave functions found in one of three ways :    1 .   the full chiral wave function of ref .",
    "@xcite ( or equivalently ref .",
    "this implements weinberg s proposal to use the chiral expansion for @xmath24 , and includes terms in the potential up to chiral order @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   in the long - wavelength approximation",
    "it is valid to employ a wave function that is the solution to the schrdinger equation with a potential which is the sum of one - pion exchange and a short - distance interaction of range @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the short - distance potential should be tuned so as to reproduce the deuteron binding energy @xmath26 and the asymptotic wave - function normalizations @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "wave functions generated using potentials with different values of @xmath29 will then differ from each other only for @xmath30 .",
    "3 .   similarly ,",
    "potential - model wave functions , e.  g. the nijm93 wave function  @xcite , can be used for @xmath10 .",
    "historically these have been the  wave functions of choice \" for @xmath0pt calculations of reactions on the deuteron . while not entirely consistent , this  hybrid \" approach has led to successful calculations of processes including , but not limited to , @xmath31  @xcite and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "@xcite contains a thorough review of results obtained via this method .",
    "in this section i will discuss some aspects of electron - deuteron scattering in @xmath0pt ( see  @xcite for a more thorough treatment ) .",
    "as is well - known , the interaction of a deuteron with an electromagnetic current is naturally described in terms of three nuclear response functions : the charge ( @xmath33 ) , magnetic ( @xmath34 ) , and quadrupole ( @xmath35 ) form factors .",
    "these form factors can be extracted from electron scattering measurements using differential cross - section and tensor - polarization data .",
    "they can also be computed systematically in @xmath0pt .",
    "the @xmath5-expansion of the deuteron charge operator is :    @xmath36 , \\label{eq : deuteroncharge}\\ ] ]    where the first term is the leading contribution , which comes only from the charge of a point proton .",
    "corrections to this @xmath37 result arise at order @xmath38 from the finite - size of the nucleon and from relativistic effects .",
    "the latter can be systematically computed in @xmath0pt and scale as @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the nucleon mass ) , but i have not written them explicitly here . at @xmath41 @xmath0pt gives a two - body contribution due to the exchange of pions in @xmath42 .",
    "this picture of the deuteron charge is similar to that obtained from systematic @xmath43 expansions in non - relativistic potential models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , apart from the somewhat unusual expedient of expanding out the nucleon s charge form factor in powers of @xmath44 .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to ask what is gained when @xmath0pt is employed here .",
    "firstly , and perhaps most importantly , one gains the ability to include two - body contributions to @xmath45 systematically . in @xmath0pt",
    "such meson - exchange currents can be included as they arise order - by - order in the @xmath5-expansion .",
    "this is a critical advantage in reactions where two - body mechanisms are important , as we shall see in section 4 .",
    "secondly , on an aesthetic level @xmath0pt leads to what might be considered a more elegant formulation  one where the amount of effort required to obtain accurate answers is commensurate with the physics of the long - wavelength limit .",
    "in particular , it is straightforward to compute wave functions and electromagnetic operators consistently , and many of the issues which arise due to the complicated form of modern @xmath23 potentials do not occur in a @xmath0pt computation of electron - deuteron scattering .",
    "in fact , it is somewhat surprising how well a very simple picture of the deuteron describes the charge and magnetic form factors . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - ed ] i have displayed the charge form factor computed with the leading - order charge of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deuteroncharge ] ) and a variety of wave functions obtained with the simple opep plus short - distance potential described in the previous section  @xcite .",
    "one sees that the sensitivity to the physics at distances smaller than @xmath29 is slight , appearing only at momentum transfers of order 600 mev .",
    "furthermore , for a range of values of @xmath29 the result for @xmath33 from these simple wave functions is close to that of the much more sophisticated nijm93 wave function .",
    "a third role of @xmath0pt is to point to physics not currently included in potential - model descriptions of electron - deuteron scattering .",
    "for instance , a survey of the results for deuteron static properties found using the same wave functions employed in the calculations for @xmath33 reveals that the deuteron quadrupole moment , @xmath46 , is particularly susceptible to short - distance physics .",
    "it varies from @xmath47 when the radius of the short - distance potential , @xmath29 , is @xmath48 to @xmath49 when @xmath50",
    ". such sensitivity of @xmath46 to short - range dynamics will be no surprise to those familiar with @xmath23 potential models .",
    "however , in an eft it suggests the presence of a two - nucleon one - quadrupole - photon counterterm which modifies @xmath46  @xcite . this is physics  beyond the nuclear standard model \" , since such mechanisms are not included in the usual calculations of @xmath46 .",
    "an analysis of the counterterm required to shift @xmath46 to its experimental value of @xmath51 suggests that it is  natural \" , i.e. of a size consistent with the scales in the problem .",
    "this counterterm , with its value adjusted to give the experimental value of @xmath46 for each different wave function , is easily included in the calculation of the tensor polarization observable @xmath52 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - ed ] then shows that ( a ) the residual sensitivity to the short - distance behaviour of the wave function is very small , and ( b ) using only the @xmath37 charge operator and the @xmath46 counterterm we can describe almost all of the existing @xmath52 data out to @xmath53 mev .",
    "in this section i will discuss compton scattering on the deuteron in @xmath0pt .",
    "@xcite contains a full treatment . )",
    "this reaction has been the subject of recent experiments  @xcite , one goal of which was to extract the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the neutron .    in the case of the proton these electric and magnetic polarizabilities , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , have been extracted from compton scattering data  @xcite : @xmath56 these numbers agree well with the _ predictions _ of @xmath0pt at leading loop order ( @xmath57 )  @xcite : @xmath58 and @xmath59 . at this order",
    "@xmath0pt also predicts @xmath60 and @xmath61 . @xmath62 and @xmath63 are difficult to extract from experiments .",
    "in particular , their difference is largely unconstrained by data .",
    "@xmath64 will play a role in compton scattering on deuterium , and one might hope to measure it there .",
    "however , if a reliable extraction of this difference is to be made from @xmath65 data a formalism must be employed in which the contribution of two - body currents to the compton cross section is under control .",
    "the two - body contributions to @xmath65 scattering can be calculated in @xmath0pt at @xmath57 in the manner described in section 2 .",
    "the resultant graphs are just the two - body analogues of the one - nucleon graphs which yield the successful @xmath0pt @xmath57 prediction of @xmath66 and @xmath67 . by sandwiching these two - body graphs between the wave - functions of ref .",
    "@xcite , and including the one - body @xmath57 @xmath0pt @xmath68 contribution , we generate the parameter - free prediction of @xmath0pt at @xmath57 for @xmath65 differential cross sections for the compton scattering process .",
    "our result should agree with data over a range of energies from about 50 mev up to @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the comparison is made in fig .",
    "[ fig - compton ] for photon energies of 69 and 95 mev .",
    "there is good agreement with the ( limited ) data at 69 mev , but our results disagree with the backward - angle data at 95 mev .",
    "this disagreement also appears in potential - model calculations of @xmath65 scattering , unless values of @xmath64 very different from @xmath69 are employed  @xcite .",
    "in fact , comparing such computations to our @xmath0pt approach to @xmath65 scattering illustrates the utility of @xmath0pt .",
    "the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite is significantly more complicated , but gives similar results to our ref .",
    "these complications arise because the potential - model approach does not exploit the simplifications offered by the long wavelength of the photons .",
