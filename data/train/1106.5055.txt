    "the lightest neutralino @xmath23 of @xmath24-parity conserving supersymmetric ( susy ) models is often touted as an excellent wimp candidate for cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe  @xcite .",
    "however , in susy models where the @xmath23 is mainly bino - like , the natural value of the relic density @xmath25 is in the 1 - 100 range  @xcite , which is far beyond the wmap observation  @xcite , _",
    "cdmh^2_cdm/_c = _ cdmh^2=0.11230.0035  68%  cl , [ eq : oh2 ] where @xmath26 is the scaled hubble constant@xcite . to gain accord between theory and observation , special neutralino annihilation mechanisms must be invoked .",
    "these include : ( _ i _ ) .",
    "co - annihilation ( usually involving @xmath23 with a stau@xcite , stop@xcite or chargino@xcite ) , ( _ ii _ ) . tempering the neutralino composition@xcite",
    "so it is a mixed bino - higgsino ( as occurs in the hyperbolic branch / focus point ( hb / fp ) region of msugra@xcite ) or mixed bino - wino state or ( _ iii _ ) . annihilation through the light ( @xmath27 ) or heavy higgs boson resonance @xmath28 )  @xcite .    in this paper , we are concerned with testing the latter annihilation mechanism , which occurs if @xmath29 . the @xmath0-resonance annihilation mechanism already occurs in the paradigm minimal supergravity ( msugra or cmssm ) model , which serves as a template for many investigations into susy phenomenology .",
    "the msugra parameters at the grand unification ( gut ) scale include m_0 ,  m_1/2 ,  a_0 ,  and  sign ( ) , where @xmath30 is a common scalar mass , @xmath31 is a common gaugino mass , @xmath32 is a common trilinear term and @xmath14 is the ratio of higgs field vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "the superpotential higgs mass term @xmath33 has its magnitude , but not sign , determined by radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry ( rewsb ) , which is seeded by the large top quark yukawa coupling .    in msugra , as @xmath14 increases , the @xmath6- and @xmath16- yukawa couplings  @xmath34 and @xmath35  also increase , and in fact their gut scale values may become comparable to @xmath36 for @xmath1 . in this case , the up and down higgs soft masses @xmath37 and @xmath38 run under renormalization group evolution to nearly similar values at the weak scale . since at the weak scale @xmath39@xcite , we find that as @xmath14 increases , the value of @xmath15 decreases@xcite , until finally the condition @xmath29 is reached , whereupon neutralino annihilation through the @xmath0-resonance may take place .",
    "another condition that occurs at large @xmath14 is that since the @xmath6- and @xmath16 yukawa couplings are growing large , the partial widths @xmath40 and @xmath41 also grow , and the @xmath0 width becomes very large ( typically into the tens of gev range ) . in this case",
    ", a wide range of parameter space actually accommodates @xmath42 annihilation through @xmath43 , and the value of @xmath44 may be a few partial widths off resonance since in the relic density calculation the @xmath42 annihilation rate times relative velocity must be thermally averaged .",
    "the question we wish to address here is : how well may one identify the cosmological scenario of _ neutralino annihilation through the heavy higgs resonance _ via measurements at the cern lhc ?",
    "since the @xmath6-quark yukawa coupling increases with @xmath14 , so do the yukawa - induced higgs production cross sections such as @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the presence of additional high @xmath48 @xmath6-jets in the final state for the second and third of these reactions allows one to tag the @xmath6-quark related production mechanisms , and also allows for a cut which rejects sm backgrounds  which do nt involve the enhanced @xmath6 yukawa coupling  at low cost to signal .",
    "the second of these reactions , which is tagged by a single @xmath6-jet in the final state , occurs at an order of magnitude greater cross section than @xmath49 production at the lhc@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath5 higgs bosons are expected to dominantly decay to @xmath50 and @xmath51 final states .",
    "then , the @xmath52 or @xmath53 modes offer a substantial lhc reach for @xmath0 and @xmath5 , especially at large @xmath14@xcite . along with these decay modes ,",
    "the decay @xmath54 has been found to be very useful  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath55 yukawa coupling constant also increases with @xmath14 , this mode maintains its branching fraction  typically at the @xmath56 level  even in the face of increasing @xmath57 partial width .",
    "it also offers the advantages in that the two high @xmath48 isolated muons are easy to tag , and the reconstruction of the invariant mass of muon pair , @xmath58 , allows a high precision measurement of the @xmath0 mass and width , @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , is was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the lhc discovery potential for @xmath59 is greatest in the @xmath60 mode at large @xmath14 , compared to @xmath61 , or @xmath62",
    ". we will adopt the @xmath63 production mode along with decay to muon pairs as a key to explore neutralino annihilation via the @xmath0-resonance in this paper .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigbmm ] , we show the leading order cross section for @xmath13 production versus @xmath15 at lhc with @xmath64 tev . we show curves for @xmath65 and @xmath5 , and for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "several features are worth noting .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath5 production are nearly identical , except at very low @xmath15 values , where substantial mixing between @xmath27 and @xmath5 occurs .    the total production cross section increases by a factor of @xmath68 in moving from @xmath66 to @xmath69 .",
    "this reflects the corresponding increase in @xmath6-quark yukawa coupling @xmath34 , and goes as @xmath70 in the total production cross section .    in spite of the small @xmath54 branching fraction of @xmath71 , the cross section for @xmath60 production via",
    "the higgs remains large , varying between over @xmath72 fb for low @xmath15 to @xmath73 fb for @xmath74 tev when @xmath14 is large .",
    "for lhc integrated luminosities ( @xmath75 ) of order @xmath76 fb@xmath12 , these rates should be sufficient at least to extract the @xmath0 and/or @xmath5 mass bump .",
    "in addition , the factorization scale and the renormalization scale are chosen to be @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "this choice of scale effectively reproduces the effects of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections@xcite .",

    "we also show the susy reach of the cern lhc assuming @xmath64 tev and 100 fb@xmath12 of integrated luminosity , taken from fig . 5 of ref .",
    "the lhc reach is mainly determined by the total cross section for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 production , followed by their subsequent cascade decays@xcite into final states with multi - jets plus multi - isolated leptons plus missing transverse energy ( met ) .",

    "production of @xmath0 and @xmath5 in association with a single @xmath6-jet offers a large background rejection at small cost to signal , especially in the large @xmath14 regime , where higgs production in association with @xmath6s is expected to be enhanced by large yukawa couplings .",
    "this is also the regime in models such as msugra where neutralino annihilation through the heavy higgs resonance is expected to occur .    in this paper , we have computed regions of @xmath222 parameter space where @xmath223 production followed by @xmath224 should be visible for various integrated luminosities .",
    "we have also performed detailed monte carlo simulations of signal and background for the lcc4 and bm600 benchmark points .",
    "fits of the dimuon mass spectra allow for sub - percent determinations of the ( nearly overlapping ) @xmath5 and @xmath0 masses .",
    "the @xmath80 overlapping widths were determined to @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) accuracy in the case of lcc4 ( bm600 ) with @xmath11 fb@xmath12 of integrated luminosity .",
    "we conclude that indeed the study of @xmath223 production followed by @xmath224 offers a unique opportunity to directly measure @xmath225 higgs width .",
    "this process also allows to measure the @xmath226 mass with unprecedented precision .",
    "both these measurements would provide crucial information to connect the cosmological @xmath227 scenario of dark matter annihilation with lhc data . combining these measurements with susy particle mass measurements such as",
    "the mass edge in @xmath98 from @xmath228 decay would go a long way towards determining the parameter @xmath14 , and also whether or not neutralino annihilation through the @xmath0 resonance ( with @xmath2 ) is the operative mechanism in the early universe to yield the measured abundance of neutralino dark matter .",
