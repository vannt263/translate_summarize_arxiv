    "in this paper we build on the results of @xcite by providing a possible experimental implementation of a direct coupled distributed quantum observer .",

    "the papers @xcite considered the problem of constructing a direct coupling quantum observer for a given quantum system .    in the papers @xcite ,",
    "the quantum plant under consideration is a linear quantum system . in recent years",
    ", there has been considerable interest in the modeling and feedback control of linear quantum systems ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "such linear quantum systems commonly arise in the area of quantum optics ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "in addition , the papers @xcite have considered the problem of providing a possible experimental implementation of the direct coupled observer described in @xcite for the case in which the quantum plant is a single quantum harmonic oscillator and the quantum observer is a single quantum harmonic oscillator . for this case ,",
    "@xcite show that a possible experimental implementation of the augmented quantum plant and quantum observer system may be constructed using a non - degenerate parametric amplifier ( ndpa ) which is coupled to a beamsplitter by suitable choice of the amplifier and beamsplitter parameters ; e.g. , see @xcite for a description of an ndpa . in this paper",
    ", we consider the issue of whether a similar experimental implementation may be provided for the distributed direct coupled quantum observer proposed in @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite proposes a direct coupled distributed quantum observer which is constructed via the direct connection of many quantum harmonic oscillators in a chain as illustrated in figure [ f0 ] .",
    "it is shown that this quantum network can be constructed so that each output of the direct coupled distributed quantum observer converges to the plant output of interest in a time averaged sense .",
    "this is a form of time averaged quantum consensus for the quantum networks under consideration .",
    "however , the experimental implementation approach of @xcite can not be extended in a straightforward way to the direct coupled distributed quantum observer @xcite .",
    "this is because it is not feasible to extend the ndpa used in @xcite to allow for the multiple direct couplings to the multiple observer elements required in the theory of @xcite .",
    "hence , in this paper , we modify the theory of @xcite to develop a new direct coupled distributed observer in which there is direct coupling only between the plant and the first element of the observer .",
    "all of the other couplings between the different elements of the observer are via optical field couplings .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "also , all of the elements of the observer except for the first one are implemented as passive optical cavities .",
    "the only active element in the augmented plant observer system is a single ndpa used to implement the plant and first observer element .",
    "these features mean that the proposed direct coupling observer is much easier to implement experimentally that the observer which was proposed in @xcite .",
    "we establish that the distributed quantum observer proposed in this paper has very similar properties to the distributed quantum observer proposed in @xcite in that each output of the distributed observer converges to the plant output of interest in a time averaged sense .",
    "however , an important difference between the observer proposed in @xcite and the observer proposed in this paper is that in @xcite the output for each observer element corresponded to the same quadrature whereas in this paper , different quadratures are used to define the outputs with a @xmath0 phase rotation as we move from observer element to element along the chain of observers .",
