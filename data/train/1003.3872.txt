    "in recent papers @xcite we have described reduced magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) simulations of the parker problem @xcite for coronal loops in cartesian geometry .",
    "we have shown that the system develops small scales , organized in current sheets elongated in the direction of the dc magnetic field , through an mhd turbulent cascade , and that a well defined power law spectrum is developed for total energy .",
    "the energy spectra develop steep slopes [ seen also in the similar simulations of a line - tied rmhd system by @xcite ] with spectral indices going from the classical @xmath3 kolmogorov spectrum up to almost  @xmath4 .",
    "the energy spectral indices ( slopes ) have a bearing on the heating rate of the boundary - forced system .",
    "the heating rates are significantly increased for realistic values of the magnetic field intensity and loop length compared to the scaling laws with fixed indices @xcite , the last being recovered when a kolmogorov - like spectrum develops ( i.e.  for weak fields or long loops ) .    in the published simulations we have always used photospheric velocity patterns made up of large spatial scale projected convection cells ( _ large - scale eddies _ ) , mimicking disordered photospheric motions .",
    "as a consequence the magnetic field developing in the corona was not in equilibrium , but dynamical evolution occurred from the outset with a time - scale set by the interplay of forcing and nonlinearity . in this paper",
    ", in order to clarify the origin of the mhd turbulent dynamics found in our previous work , we explore the dynamics of coronal loops system when a shear velocity flow stirs the footpoints of the magnetic field - lines .",
    "it is commonly thought that the topology of the photospheric driver should strongly influence the dynamics of a coronal loop , and that the magnetic field - lines anchored to the photospheric planes should _ passively _ follow their footpoints motions . in this picture",
    "the electric currents should develop along neighboring field - lines whose footpoints have a relative shear motion .",
    "in particular it might be argued that in our previous simulations the turbulent dynamics of the coronal medium originated from the `` complexity '' of the photospheric forcing patterns , with their large - scale eddies and stagnation points .",
    "the _ simple _ unidimensional shear forcing velocity used here allows a very _ clear - cut numerical experiment _ : if the field - lines were to passively follow the imposed footpoint motion only a sheared magnetic field would develop inside the volume .",
    "the dynamics of these current layers are subject to tearing instabilities @xcite .",
    "if this were the physical process at work the topology of the magnetic field would remain a _ mapping _ of the forcing velocity pattern , periodically disrupted by tearing - like instabilities when the shear grew beyond a threshold amount .",
    "simulations show that initially the magnetic field is sheared and a tearing instability develops , but afterwards turbulent dynamics similar to those with more _ complex _ boundary patterns develop , clarifying that turbulence does not stem from a direct influence of the photospheric velocity pattern but it is due to the inherent nonlinear properties of the system .",
    "the parker scenario for coronal heating has been the subject of intense research .",
    "both analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite investigations have been carried out .",
    "given the complexity of such boundary forced field - line tangling systems simplified models have been developed , including 2d incompressible mhd models with magnetic forcing @xcite and shell models @xcite .",
    "insights gleaned from these models include the important result that dissipation in forced mhd turbulence occurs in the form of `` bursty '' events with well defined power law distributions in energy release , peak dissipation , and duration , in a way reminiscent of , and consistent with , the distribution of flares in the solar corona .",
    "an analytical model of a forced system very similar to the simulation presented here was proposed by @xcite , and recently extended to the anisotropic turbulence regime by @xcite .",
    "they started with same mhd system threaded by a strong axial magnetic field in cartesian geometry and apply at the top and bottom boundaries two 1d velocity fields of opposite direction and assumed that the sheared structure that develops in the corona then dissipates via an effective `` turbulent resistivity '' provided by a cascade , so that a dissipative equilibrium is set up in which shearing is balanced by slippage provided by the turbulence .",
    "this amounts essentially to a _",
    "one - point closure _ model of mhd turbulence @xcite , where turbulence acts only on very small - scales while the large - scales remain laminar and indeed with the same large - scale magnetic structure .",
    "they then use the eddy - damped quasi - normal markovian approximation ( edqnm ) @xcite to estimate the effective cascade and dissipation for the given driving shear , and this allow them to develop a heating theory in which the only free parameter is the equivalent kolmogorov constant . in contrast , our simulations will show that nonlinearity can not be neglected even at the large - scales , so that the turbulent self - consistent state has little resemblance to the imposed shear flow . as a result @xcite overestimate the heating rate as laminar dynamics",
    "would lead to a higher energy injection ( poynting flux ) .",
    "more recently @xcite have proposed the so - called `` secondary instability '' as a leading mechanism operating in the parker scenario , responsible for the rapid release of energy . in their view ,",
    "disruption on ideal time - scale must arise after some time while slow quasi - steady reconnection allows magnetic energy to continue to accumulate in the system .",
    "in their view the system evolution may be described by a sequence of equilibria destabilized by magnetic reconnection .",
    "the bulk of numerical simulations performed by @xcite has proven that the system does not evolve through a sequence of equilibria , rather more complex dynamics develop .",
    "the initial setup of the simulation presented in @xcite is also very similar to the one implemented in this paper but , besides the lower resolution and therefore the higher influence of numerical diffusion , the time interval for which they advance the equations is too short compared with coronal loops and active region time - scales .",
    "these leads them to claim as representative of the dynamics what is actually a _ transient _ event taking place only during the early stage of the dynamics , in our case the multiple tearing mode current sheet collapse .",
    "this evolution is not generic , but is only representative of a small class of very symmetric boundary velocity patterns , those which admit coronal equilibria at all times .",
    "we will return to this question and a more detailed discussion in the conclusion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : gebc ] we describe the basic governing equations and boundary conditions , as well as the numerical code used to integrate them . in   [ par3 ]",
    "we discuss the initial conditions for our simulations and briefly summarize the linear stage dynamics more extensively detailed in @xcite , while in   [ sec : ed ] we outline the main points of @xcite relevant to this work .",
    "the results of our numerical simulations are presented in   [ sec : ns ] , while the final section is devoted to our conclusions and discussion of the impact of this work on coronal physics .",
    "we model a coronal loop as an axially elongated cartesian box with an orthogonal cross section of size @xmath5 and an axial length @xmath6 embedded in an homogeneous and uniform axial magnetic field @xmath7 aligned along the @xmath8-direction .",
    "any curvature effect is neglected .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are implemented .    at the top plate @xmath12",

    "the dynamics are integrated , as in our previous works , using the equations of rmhd @xcite , which are well suited for a plasma embedded in a strong axial magnetic field . in dimensionless form",
    "they are given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the velocity and magnetic fields components orthogonal to the axial field , @xmath21 is the kinetic pressure .",
    "the gradient operator has components only in the perpendicular @xmath10-@xmath11 planes @xmath22 while the linear term @xmath23 couples the planes along the axial direction through a wave - like propagation at the alfvn speed @xmath24 .",
    "incompressibility in rmhd equations follows from the large value of the axial magnetic fields @xcite and they remain valid also for low @xmath25 systems @xcite such as the corona .    to render the equations nondimensional , we have first expressed the magnetic field as an alfvn velocity [ @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the density supposed homogeneous and constant , and then all velocities have been normalized to the velocity @xmath28 , the order of magnitude of photospheric convective motions .",

    "the majority of the simulations performed [ specifically runs  a  e ( see table  [ tbl ] ) ] use a standard simplified diffusion model , in which both the magnetic resistivity @xmath33 and viscosity @xmath34 are constant and uniform .",

    "the index @xmath40 is called _ dissipativity _ and for @xmath41 the dissipative terms in ( [ eq : eq1])-([eq : eq2 ] ) correspond to so - called hyperdiffusion @xcite .",
    "we use hyperdiffusion , with @xmath42 , only in runs  f and g ( table  [ tbl ] ) dedicated to study the energy spectra .",
    "hyperdiffusion is used because , even with a grid of @xmath43 points in the x - y plane ( the highest resolution grid we used for the plane ) , the timescales associated with ordinary diffusion are small enough to affect the large - scale dynamics and render difficult the resolution of an inertial range .",
    "the diffusive time @xmath44 at the scale @xmath45 associated with the dissipative terms used in equations  ( [ eq : eq1])-([eq : eq2 ] ) is given by @xmath46 for @xmath38 the diffusive time decreases relatively slowly toward smaller scales , while for @xmath42 it decreases far more rapidly . as a result for @xmath42 we have longer diffusive timescales at large spatial scales and diffusive timescales similar to the case with @xmath38 at the resolution scale . numerically we require the diffusion time at the resolution scale @xmath47 , where n is the number of grid points , to be of the same order of magnitude for both normal and hyperdiffusion , i.e. , @xmath48 then for a numerical grid with @xmath49 points that requires a reynolds number @xmath50 with ordinary diffusion we can implement @xmath51 ( table  [ tbl ] ) , removing diffusive effects at the large scales and allowing ( if present ) the resolution of an inertial range .",
    "we solve numerically equations  ( [ eq : eq1])-([eq : eq3 ] ) written in terms of the potentials of the orthogonal velocity and magnetic fields [ see @xcite for a more detailed description of the numerical code ] in fourier space , i.e.  we advance the fourier components in the @xmath10- and @xmath11-directions of the scalar potentials . along the @xmath8-direction ,",
    "no fourier transform is performed so that we can impose non - periodic boundary conditions (   [ par3 ] ) , and a central second - order finite - difference scheme is used . in the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane , a fourier pseudospectral method is implemented .",
    "time is discretized with a third - order runge - kutta method .",
    "at time @xmath52 we start our simulations with a uniform and homogeneous magnetic field along the axial direction @xmath53 .",

    "considering the boundary conditions ( [ eq : f0])-([eq : f1 ] ) imposed in most of the following simulations we obtain @xmath61 both fields are a clear _ mapping _ of the shear velocity at the boundary , with the magnetic field increasing its magnitude linearly in time .",
    "when we shear the field - lines from both photospheric plates ( @xmath9 and @xmath6 ) using the forcing ( [ eq : f0])-([eq : f2 ] ) we obtain a very similar result , still a _ mapping _ but with different amplitudes : @xmath62    for a generic forcing the solution ( [ eq : lin1])-([eq : lin2 ] ) is valid only during the linear stage , while for @xmath63 when the fields are big enough the nonlinear terms can not be neglected .",
    "nevertheless there is a singular subset of velocity forcing patterns for which the generated coronal fields ( [ eq : lin1])-([eq : lin2 ] ) have a vanishing lorentz force and the nonlinear terms vanish exactly .",

    "such a configuration is very well known to be unstable to reconnection , and then it is expected that a tearing - like instability should develop .",
    "what is surprising are the dynamics at later times .",
    "in fact as can be seen in figures  [ fig1]-[fig2 ] for @xmath120 the system reaches a _ magnetically dominated statistically steady state _ where integrated quantities fluctuate around an average value . in particular velocity fluctuations",
    "are smaller than magnetic fluctuations , which in turn are small compared to the axial magnetic field ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "therefore the orthogonal magnetic and velocity fields satisfy the rmhd ordering that requires them to be small compared to the axial field @xmath119 .",
    "the energy power entering the system at the boundaries as a result of the work done by photospheric motions on the footpoints of magnetic field - lines is given by the integrated pointing flux @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the photospheric forcing velocity  ( [ eq : f0 ] ) .",
    "dissipation rates and the poynting flux also fluctuate around a mean value .",
    "in particular , as shown in the inset in figure  [ fig2 ] , the poynting flux and the total dissipation ( ohmic plus viscous ) balance each other on the average , although on shorter timescales a lag between the two signals is present . in this steady state the energy that is injected into the system is then , on the average , completely dissipated .",
    "the surprising feature is that the shearing in the magnetic field inside the volume is not recreated , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "it is natural to think that after the first big dissipative event around @xmath124 , the shear forcing velocity at the boundary would recreate over time a sheared magnetic field in the system that should then lead to another big dissipative event and so on .",
    "the dynamics of this system are in fact commonly approximated as a sequence of equilibria , each destabilized by magnetic reconnection .",
    "this approximation is attained by neglecting the velocity and kinetic pressure in the mhd equations whose solution is then bound to be a static force - free equilibrium .",
    "our simulations confirm that the system is magnetically dominated , and in particular magnetic energy is bigger than kinetic energy , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] where on the average @xmath125 .",
    "but the self - consistent evolution of the kinetic pressure and velocity , although small compared with the dominant axial magnetic field @xmath119 , does not bind the system to force - free equilibria and allows the possible development of alternative dynamics .    in the following sections we will analyze further aspects of the dynamics and the spectral properties of the system .",
    "but first we illustrate the topology of the magnetic and velocity fields , to understand why a sheared magnetic field is not recreated .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] at time @xmath118 reconnection starts to develop , enhancing the ohmic dissipation , that reaches a peak around @xmath124 .",
    "this big dissipative event burns a large fraction of the magnetic energy previously accumulated by the system ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) . _ but",
    "not all the magnetic energy is dissipated _ , which would otherwise bring the system to a configuration similar to the initial condition at @xmath52 .",
    "this dissipative event is in fact due to magnetic reconnection , that during its evolution produces a component of the magnetic field along @xmath10 , the cross - shear direction , forming magnetic islands [ see figure  [ fig3 ] at times @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "in fact around @xmath128 , at the end of the big dissipative event , the topology of the orthogonal component of the magnetic field is characterized by magnetic islands .",
    "naturally the lorentz force does not vanish now and the vorticity is not constant along the streamlines . as typical of magnetic reconnection vorticity forms misaligned quadrupolar structures around current sheets [ see @xcite ] .",
    "although the forcing velocity at the boundary is always a shear [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f0])-([eq : f1 ] ) ] , _ nonlinear terms do not vanish _ as they do during the linear stage for @xmath129 .",
    "when they vanish magnetic energy can be stored without getting dissipated ( see  [ par3 ] ) .",
    "but now nonlinearity can _ redistribute _ along the cross - shear ( @xmath10 ) direction part of the energy associated with the shear - aligned ( @xmath11-oriented ) field along which the forcing injects energy , and continuously cascades to lower scales as described in the following sections .",
    "the three - dimensional structures are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "although the magnetic energy dominates over the kinetic energy , the ratio of the rms of the orthogonal magnetic field over the axial dominant field @xmath119 is quite small .",
    "for @xmath130 it is @xmath131 , so that the average inclination of the magnetic field - lines with respect to the axial direction is just @xmath132 , it is only for lower value of @xmath24 that this ratio increases and the angle increases accordingly @xcite .",
    "the field - lines of the total magnetic field at time @xmath133 are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] ( _ top row _ ) .",
    "the computational box has been rescaled for an improved viewing , and to attain the original aspect ratio , the box should be stretched 10 times along the axial direction .",
    "the magnetic topology for the total field is quite simple , as the lines appear slightly bent .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] ( _ bottom row _ ) also shows a view from the side and the top of the 3d current sheets at time @xmath133 .",
    "the current sheets , elongated along the axial direction , look space filling when watched from the side of the computational box , but the view from the top shows that the filling factor is actually small , as they are almost 2d structures .",
    "so far we have analyzed the topology of the field - lines only in the mid - plane @xmath116 . in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the current density and magnetic field lines of @xmath134 in the mid - plane ( @xmath116 ) and in two other @xmath10-@xmath11 planes close to the boundaries ( @xmath135 and @xmath136 , the axial length @xmath99 ) .",
    "the behavior is similar at different heights although in the plane @xmath137 , closer to the forced boundary @xmath113 , the topology of the field appears to be affected to some extent by the sheared velocity forcing ( [ eq : f0 ] ) directed along the @xmath11  direction .",

    "in fact for the simulation presented in this section ( run  a ) , for which we have imposed the shear velocity profile ( [ eq : f0 ] ) at the top plate @xmath113 and a vanishing velocity at the bottom plate @xmath9 , the magnetic field in the linear stage is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin1s ] ) [ or ( [ eq : diff1 ] ) with @xmath140 including diffusion ] therefore the correlation is 1 as @xmath141 is proportional to the boundary velocity @xmath56 .",
    "next as the system transitions to the nonlinear stage releasing most of the accumulated magnetic energy the correlation between the magnetic field and the boundary forcing velocity decreases swiftly , at a faster pace the farther from the forced boundary @xmath113 , as shown by the curves at times @xmath142 .",
    "the correlation during the fully nonlinear stage is shown with color lines at @xmath97 selected times separated by @xmath143 in the interval @xmath144 .",
    "the correlation vanishes near the bottom boundary and then grows almost linearly with @xmath8 up to @xmath145 at the top boundary . as expected the correlation is bigger near the forced boundary and fades towards the interior of the computational box .",
    "the magnetic field is overall weakly correlated with the forcing velocity , and at most reaches a mild correlation close to the forcing boundary , but it is never close to a strong correlation @xmath146 .    in figure  [ fig7 ] we show the 2d averages in the x - y planes of the magnetic and velocity fields and of the ohmic dissipation @xmath147 plotted as a function of @xmath8 at different times .",
    "the behaviour is very similar to our previous simulations with different ( _ vortical _ ) forcing patterns @xcite .",
    "these macroscopic quantities are smooth and present almost no variation along the axial direction .",
    "the velocity must approach its boundary values at @xmath9 and @xmath97 , and in the volume grows to values higher than the boundary velocity @xmath148 .",
    "in fact also the velocity inside the volume is not a mapping of the boundary forcing but develops self - consistently , in particular the plasma jets at reconnection locations contribute too to its average .",
    "the reason of the overall smooth behavior of these quantities is that every disturbance or gradient along the axial direction is smoothed out by the fast propagation of alfvn waves along this direction ; their propagation time @xmath108 is in fact the fastest timescale present ( in particular faster than the nonlinear timescale @xmath149 ) , and then the system tends to be homogeneous along this direction .",
    "simulations  a - e differ only for the value of the reynolds number ( and corresponding grid resolution ) , all other parameters are the same including the amplitude of the perturbations . in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we plot the total dissipation for the 5 simulations as a function of time .",
    "the simulation described in the previous paragraph had @xmath150 , after the first big dissipative peak its signal displays a complex temporal structure that arises from the underlying turbulent dynamics . decreasing the value of the reynolds number to @xmath151 the structure of the signal",
    "has a simpler structure , with an almost sinusoidal form of different amplitude and period @xmath152 in some time intervals .",
    "the dotted lines represent the linear diffusive behavior described in   [ par3 ] .",
    "these solutions [ eq .  ( [ eq : diff3 ] ) ] are obtained when the nonlinear terms can be neglected .",
    "this can happen either because they vanish exactly due to the symmetry of the forcing velocity ( as discussed in   [ par3 ] ) or equivalently _ when nonlinear terms are depleted by diffusion _ , i.e.  when _ diffusion dominates the dynamics_.    at @xmath153 diffusion affects the system substantially , the instability takes longer to develop , and afterward the actual signal and linear saturation curve differ little .",
    "there is no first big dissipative peak , for a long time up to @xmath154 the signal follows the linear saturation curve   ( [ eq : diff3 ] ) .",
    "afterwards it departs slightly displaying a sinusoidal behavior of very small amplitude .    at lower reynolds number ( @xmath155 and @xmath97",
    "are shown ) diffusion dominates the dynamics , and no small scales is formed , while ohmic dissipation and energy follow the curve  ( [ eq : diff2])-([eq : diff3 ] ) describing the diffusive equilibrium that is formed , as nonlinear terms are completely depleted .",
    "it is very interesting to notice that total dissipation for simulations a , b and c with @xmath101 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 substantially overlap each other . as typical with spectral numerical codes , which use fourier transforms to compute derivatives , dissipation due to numerical _ implicit",
    "_ diffusion is very small .",
    "we have checked that the energy conservation equation , which can be derived from eqs .",

    "* figure  5.5 ) .",
    "therefore in the simulations presented here the dissipation rates are substantially due to the _ explicit dissipative terms _ present in equations  ( [ eq : eq1])-([eq : eq2 ] ) , while the diffusion due to the numerical schemes is negligible .",
    "we had already seen this behavior in our previous simulations with vortex forcing @xcite , but in that case the boundary velocity was slightly different in each simulation .",
    "in fact it was built by a linear combination of fourier modes with _ random _ amplitudes normalized to have the same rms , but the spatial pattern was different for every simulation as determined by the random amplitudes . in the simulations presented here",
    "the forcing is exactly the same for each simulation , as it is simply a single fourier mode [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : f0 ] ) ] .",
    "as the forcing is the same for each simulation the overlap is more evident , and makes stronger the claim that total dissipation is _ independent of the reynolds number beyond a threshold_. we conjectured this hypothesis @xcite because the energy flux entering the system ( poynting flux ) and the energy transport from large to small scales due to the development of a turbulent dynamics are both independent from the reynolds number , where the turbulent transport exhibits this property only for a _ sufficiently high value _ of the reynolds number .",
    "this unfortunately _ does not _ imply at all that the thermodynamical and radiative outcome is independent of the reynolds number .",
    "in fact how field - lines are heated strongly depends on the dynamics and properties around the single current sheet .",
    "these become thinner and thinner at higher reynolds numbers and the overall dynamics more chaotic .",
    "hence the thermodynamical properties of the field - lines that cross the current sheets ( elongated along the axial direction ) and get so heated _ impulsively _ are all to be explored .",
    "an open question is whether the dissipation is independent of the reynolds number also in the single current sheets , or their number and properties change to attain independence for the total dissipation .",
    "research in this area is active @xcite and has already shown that at relatively high reynolds numbers reconnection departs the classic sweet - parker scalings in the mhd regime .",
    "furthermore for a plasma in coronal conditions kinetic effects can not be excluded a priori , in fact they might play an important role in dissipating energy through particle acceleration .",
    "also the high value of the magnetic prandtl number could have a bearing @xcite .",
    "nonetheless the total dissipation , integrated over the whole volume , is likely to not depend on the detailed small - scale dissipative mechanism .",
    "in fact the energy injection rate  [ eq .  ( [ eq : pf ] ) ] depends only on the large scale fields and the transfer of this energy toward the small scales appears to be local @xcite , i.e.  it is determined by the fields at neighboring large scales , thus making also the transfer energy rate toward the small scales independent of the reynolds number ( provided it is beyond a minimal threshold to have scale separation ) .    in figure  [ fig9 ]",
    "we show a close - up of total dissipation for an equal interval of time @xmath160 on the same scale in order to highlight their temporal structures . at higher reynolds number",
    "smaller time frequencies are present , a clear indication of a transition to turbulence @xcite . for reynolds numbers lower than @xmath161 ,",
    "the signal is completely flat following exactly the linear saturation curve eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff3 ] ) .      in order to study the spectral properties of the system and compare them with those of previous simulations",
    "we have performed a new simulation where the sheared forcing is applied on _ both the top and bottom plates _ ( run  f ) with reversed direction [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f0 ] ) and ( [ eq : f2 ] ) ] .",
    "we compare these results with those obtained from a previous simulation ( run  g ) , that has all the same parameters , except that on the two boundary planes a large - scale `` vortex - like '' velocity pattern with the same rms ( @xmath162 ) is applied .",
    "both simulations have been performed with a numerical resolution of @xmath163 grid points , and hyperdiffusion with dissipativaty @xmath42 and @xmath164 .    in figure  [ fig10 ]",
    "we plot the energy spectra obtained from runs  f and g. they are very similar to each other . both the velocity and magnetic fields develop inertial ranges following power laws , and overlap each other . for both runs the spectral index of the kinetic spectrum ( @xmath165 ) is much smaller than that of the magnetic energy ( @xmath166 ) , that is steeper than kolmogorov ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "also the kinetic energy has a lower value than the magnetic energy , as already noticed for the integrated quantities ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the energy that is injected into the system for unit time is the integrated poynting flux @xmath167 where @xmath123 and @xmath168 are the imposed velocity patterns at the top and bottom planes .    for run  g",
    ", we excite all wavenumbers @xmath169 , while for run  f we _ excite only one fourier component _ as @xmath170 , i.e.  we are injecting energy in the system only at @xmath171 , the wavenumber @xmath13 along @xmath10 .",
    "this can be noticed also in figure  [ fig10 ] , where the kinetic spectrum for run  g at @xmath172 is higher than for run  f , as part of the energy is injected also at @xmath172 in the vortical case .",
    "the lower level for the kinetic spectrum is due to the boundary conditions that roughly set the value or the velocity at the injection wavenumbers inside the volume . in the simple linear case this",
    "is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin2 ] ) . in the shear case",
    "we would have @xmath173 ( @xmath174 is the volume ) in the linear regime , and from figure  [ fig10 ] we notice that also in the nonlinear regime @xmath175 .",
    "on the other hand the magnetic field grows linearly in time [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin1 ] ) ] until a balance is reached between the energy flux that is injected at this scale and the flux of energy flowing towards smaller scales through a turbulent cascade .",
    "the magnetic energy spectra of the two simulations are slightly different at the large scales with @xmath176 .",
    "the large scale dynamics is in fact slightly different in the two cases .    in the vortical case (",
    "run  g ) energy is injected in all modes with wavenumbers @xmath169 that then cascades toward smaller scales . in the shear case ( run  f ) energy is injected only at one wavenumber @xmath177 .",
    "we have already noticed in   [ sec411 ] that although we continue shearing the footpoints of the field - lines with our 1d forcing [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : f0 ] ) ] in the nonlinear stage the orthogonal magnetic field is organized in magnetic islands ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , so that it is no longer a mapping of the boundary velocity .",
    "although energy is injected only in the wavenumber 4 along x , energy is then redistributed by the nonlinear terms also to modes with wavenumbers along y at the large scales , and a small inverse cascade is present as in run  g. this is the basic mechanism by which magnetic islands are sustained throughout the simulation in the nonlinear stage .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the dynamics of the parker problem for the heating of coronal loops when the footpoints of the magnetic field - lines are stirred by a 1d shear velocity pattern at the photosphere - mimicking boundary , and compared these results with those previously obtained when a more complex `` vortex - like '' velocity pattern was imposed @xcite .",
    "this very simple forcing is ideal to investigate the origin of turbulence in coronal loops and the influence of the boundary velocity forcing on the dynamics of the system .",
    "initially the sheared velocity forcing induces a sheared perpendicular magnetic field inside the volume .",
    "the resulting current layers are known to be unstable to tearing modes @xcite .",
    "in fact when the system transitions from the linear to the nonlinear stage it is due to a multiple tearing instability , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "but once the system has become fully nonlinear the dynamics are fundamentally different . as the nonlinear terms no longer vanish they now do transport energy from the large to the small scales where in correspondence of the x - points _ nonlinear _ magnetic reconnection takes place , without going through a series of equilibria disrupted by tearing - like instabilities .",
    "similarly to the case with disordered vortical boundary forcing velocities @xcite in the fully nonlinear stage the system is highly dynamical and chaotic ( and increasingly so at higher reynolds numbers ) .",
    "for this we do not observe secondary tearing of the current sheets as in 2d high - resolution simulations of decaying mhd turbulence @xcite , as now at the small scales fast turbulent dynamics take place .",
    "the dynamics of the parker model do not depend strongly on the pattern of the velocity forcing that mimics photospheric motions , as far as they are constant in time ( we defer the investigation of time - dependent boundary forcing to a future work ) .",
    "the shear forcing [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : f0 ] ) ] applied only at the top plate is a very simple and ordered one - dimensional forcing .",
    "we have shown that the resulting dynamics are very similar to those developed when a more complex and disordered `` vortex - type '' forcing velocity is applied .",
    "we conclude that the turbulent properties of the system are not induced by the _ complexity _ of the path that the footpoints follow .",
    "it is rather the system itself to be intrinsically turbulent , and turbulence develops as we continuously inject energy at the scale of photospheric motions ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "the system reaches a statistically steady state where , although the footpoints of the field - lines are continuously dragged by the forcing shear , this does not induce a sheared magnetic field in the computational box .",
    "in fact the topology of _ the magnetic field is not a mapping of the forcing velocity field_. nonlinear interactions are able to redistribute the energy that is injected only at the wavenumber @xmath179 also to perpendicular wavenumbers and to smaller wavenumbers through an mhd turbulent cascade . in physical space",
    "this corresponds to the magnetic field being organized in magnetic islands , to small - scales formation ( current sheets elongated along the axial direction ) and to magnetic reconnection taking place .",
    "kinetic and magnetic energies develop an inertial range where spectra exhibit a power - law behavior .",
    "fluctuating magnetic energy dominates over kinetic energy .",
    "spectra and integrated quantities , like energies and total dissipative rates , have values similar to those obtained with a vortex - type forcing velocity .",
    "in particular the total dissipation rate of the same system simulated with different reynolds number appear to overlap each other beyond @xmath153 , suggesting that this is independent of the reynolds number beyond a threshold .",
    "as shown in figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] initially the system until time @xmath118 follows the linear curves  ( [ eq : lin2 ] ) and ( [ eq : diff1 ] ) . up to this point",

    "@xmath90 the instability develops sooner and for smaller values later , always following the linear curves until the instability transitions to the nonlinear stage .",
    "the more complete and systematic analysis of @xcite in 2d confirms this behavior .",
    "@xcite have performed a similar simulation with a lower resolution and with a fixed value for the perturbation and for a time interval that covers only the initial stage of our simulations .",
    "they in fact stop right after the first big dissipative peak , that in our figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] corresponds at @xmath183 .",
    "continuing the simulation , and using a higher numerical resolution , the system reaches a statistically steady state where magnetic energy consistently fluctuates around a mean value and the shear is not recreated in the topology of the orthogonal magnetic field .",
    "their analysis is then limited to a _ transient _ event taking place only during the early stages of the dynamics , and that afterward does not repeat .    as shown in @xcite during the linear stage",
    "the system is able to accumulate energy well beyond the average value maintained in the nonlinear stage only if the boundary forcing velocity satisfies the condition that its _",
    "vorticity is constant along the streamlines_. the sheared profiles used in this paper satisfy this condition as well the profile used by @xcite ( a linear combination of 6 sheared profiles ) .",
    "these profiles are a very small subset of all the possible forcing profiles , and while they are very useful to get insight into the origin of turbulence in coronal loops they are not representative of the disordered photospheric motions , for which the strong stress buildup required for secondary instability to develop does not take place .",
    "the significance of their conclusions is then strongly diminished .",
    "furthermore the parker angle for this system can not be defined as the relative angle between magnetic field - lines at which the system becomes unstable .",
    "this is not a _ well - posed _ definition .",
    "in fact for given initial conditions the angle or equivalently the time ( as the linear equation ( [ eq : lin2 ] ) and ( [ eq : diff1 ] ) imply ) at which the instability develops depend on the value of the amplitude of the perturbation that we add to the system .",
    "depending on the value of the perturbation the parker angle so defined _ is not unique_.    on the other hand in the fully nonlinear stage the average magnetic field line magnitude fluctuates around a mean value .",
    "it is then possible to give a unique value for the parker angle , defined now as the average inclination of the magnetic field - lines respect to the axial direction as done in @xcite , and as originally introduced by @xcite .    as summarized in ",
    "[ sec : ed ] the one - point closure model developed by @xcite splits the domain into large and small scales . they conjecture that the large - scale fields evolve into a stationary laminar regime , the field magnitudes determined by the effective diffusion coefficients .",
    "these laminar regimes correspond to our linear saturated diffusive regimes computed in   [ par3 ] . in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "the dotted lines show such diffusive curves for different values of the reynolds numbers .    in their model",
    "the large - scale fields computed in this way are used to obtain @xmath92 , the energy flowing into the system for unit time at the boundary ( the power ) due do the work done by photospheric motions on the magnetic field - lines footpoints .",
    "they also calculate , through an edqnm approximation , the value of the spectral energy flux @xmath90 flowing along the inertial range at the small scales .",
    "both @xmath92 and @xmath90 are functions of the effective diffusion coefficients , and the solution of the problem results requiring balance between the two powers @xmath184 [ @xmath92 and @xmath90 have both the dimension of a power , i.e.  energy over time , as @xmath92 is the poynting flux integrated over the boundary surface and @xmath90 is integrated over the whole volume as in @xcite ] .",
    "as shown in our simulations the large - scale fields are not laminar , and they are stationary only statistically .",
    "nevertheless it is useful to use @xcite model in order to understand why it is not applicable . from figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we can estimate that the _ effective _ reynolds number for which the diffusive regime dissipation matches the dissipation of the simulated system is @xmath185 .",
    "unfortunately this values is too low for their model to work .",
    "in fact for @xmath186 the dynamics are so diffusive that only a few modes of the order of the injection scale ( @xmath178 ) are not suppressed but only reduced in magnitude .",
    "therefore there is no flux of energy at the small scales @xmath187 .    at a more fundamental level the idea to split the domain into large and small scales does not work because nonlinearity can not be confined only at the small - scales . as shown by our simulations _",
    "nonlinearity _ is at work at all scales , and unfortunately this fundamental aspect _ can not be circumvented_.    finally the use of rmhd equations is valid as far as the magnetic field fluctuations @xmath20 are small compared to the axial magnetic field @xmath119 .",
    "this seems particularly apt to describe the dynamics of long - lived slender loops that apparently show no dynamics while shining bright at the resolution scale ( @xmath188 ) of current state - of - the - art x - ray and euv imagers onboard hinode and stereo .",
    "clearly these results do not apply to highly dynamical active regions where dynamics can not be modeled as fluctuations about an equilibrium configuration .",
    "the series of simulations that we have performed proves that dragging the footpoints of magnetic field - lines in the parker problem quickly triggers nonlinear dynamics for small values of the orthogonal magnetic fields , and that these small magnetic field fluctuations are able to transport a considerable amount of energy toward the small scales with the overall energy flux @xmath189 @xcite in the lower range of the observed constraint @xmath190 .",
    "this prevents the orthogonal magnetic fluctuations to grow to an arbitrarily high value , self - consistently limiting the dynamics of the parker problem to small fluctuations if the initial conditions are given by a uniform strong axial magnetic field .",

    "<S> we present a series of numerical simulations aimed at understanding the nature and origin of turbulence in coronal loops in the framework of the parker model for coronal heating . </S>",
    "<S> a coronal loop is studied via reduced magnetohydrodynamics simulations in cartesian geometry . a uniform and strong magnetic field threads </S>",
    "<S> the volume between the two photospheric planes , where a velocity field in the form of a 1d shear flow pattern is present . </S>",
    "<S> initially the magnetic field that develops in the coronal loop is a simple map of the photospheric velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> this initial configuration is unstable to a multiple tearing instability that develops islands with @xmath0 and @xmath1 points in the plane orthogonal to the axial field . </S>",
    "<S> once the nonlinear stage sets in the system evolution is characterized by a regime of mhd turbulence dominated by magnetic energy . a well developed power law in energy spectra is observed and the magnetic field never returns to the simple initial state mapping the photospheric flow . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 points in the planes orthogonal to the axial field allows the continued and repeated formation and dissipation of small scale current sheets where the plasma is heated . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the observed turbulent dynamics are not induced by the complexity of the pattern that the magnetic field - lines footpoints follow but they rather stem from the inherent nonlinear nature of the system . </S>",
