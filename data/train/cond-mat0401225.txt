    "the empirical probability distribution functions ( edfs ) for different assets have been extensively studied by the econophysics community in recent years @xcite .",
    "stock and stock - index returns have received special attention .",
    "we focus here on the edfs of the returns of individual large american companies from 1993 to 1999 , a period without major market disturbances . by ` return '",
    "we always mean ` log - return ' , the difference of the logarithms of prices at two times separated by a time lag @xmath0 .",
    "the time lag @xmath0 is an important parameter : the edfs evolve with this parameter . at micro lags ( typically shorter than one hour )",
    ", effects such as the discreteness of prices and transaction times , correlations between successive transactions , and fluctuations in trading rates become important .",
    "power - law tails of edfs in this regime have been much discussed in the literature before @xcite . at ` meso",
    "' time lags ( typically from an hour to a month ) , continuum approximations can be made , and some sort of diffusion process is plausible , eventually leading to a normal gaussian distribution . on the other hand , at ` macro ' time lags , the changes in the mean market drifts and macroeconomic ` convection ' effects can become important , so simple results are less likely to be obtained . the boundaries between these domains to an extent depend on the stock , the market where it is traded , and the epoch .",
    "the micro - meso boundary can be defined as the time lag above which power - law tails constitute a very small part of the edf .",
    "the meso - macro boundary is more tentative , since statistical data at long time lags become sparse .",
    "the first result is that we extend to meso time lags a stylized fact known since the 19th century @xcite ( quoted in @xcite ) : with a careful definition of time lag @xmath0 , the variance of returns is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the second result is that log - linear plots of the edfs show prominent straight - line ( tent - shape ) character , i.e.  the bulk ( about 99% ) of the probability distribution of log - return follows an exponential law .",
    "the exponential law applies to the central part of edfs , i.e.  not too big log - returns . for the far tails of edfs , usually associated with power laws at micro time lags",
    ", we do not have enough statistically reliable data points at meso lags to make a definite conclusion .",
    "exponential distributions have been reported for some world markets @xcite and briefly mentioned in the book @xcite ( see fig .",
    "however , the exponential law has not yet achieved the status of a stylized fact .",
    "perhaps this is because influential work @xcite has been interpreted as finding that the individual returns of all the major us stocks for micro to macro time lags have the same power law edfs , if they are rescaled by the volatility .",
    "the heston model is a plausible diffusion model with stochastic volatility , which reproduces the timelag - variance proportionality and the crossover from exponential distribution to gaussian .",
    "this model was first introduced by heston , who studied option prices @xcite .",
    "later drgulescu and yakovenko ( dy ) derived a convenient closed - form expression for the probability distribution of returns in this model and applied it to stock indexes from 1 day to 1 year @xcite .",
    "the third result is that the dy formula with three lag - independent parameters reasonably fits the time evolution of edfs at meso lags .",
    "in this section , the heston model @xcite and the dy formula @xcite are briefly summarized .",
    "the price @xmath1 of a model stock obeys the stochastic differential equation of multiplicative brownian motion : @xmath2 . here",
    "the subscript @xmath0 indicates time dependence , @xmath3 is the drift parameter , @xmath4 is a standard random wiener process , and @xmath5 is the fluctuating time - dependent variance . the detrended log - return is defined as @xmath6 , although detrending is a minor correction at meso lags . in the heston model ,",
    "the variance @xmath5 obeys the mean - reverting stochastic differential equation : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the long - time mean of @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the rate of relaxation to this mean , and @xmath11 is the variance noise .",
    "we take the wiener processes @xmath12 to be uncorrelated .",
    "the dy formula @xcite for the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath13 is : @xmath14 , \\label{eq : dy }   \\\\    & & \\tilde t=\\gamma t , \\quad \\alpha=2\\gamma\\theta/\\kappa^2 ,    \\quad \\omega=\\sqrt{1+(k\\kappa/\\gamma)^2 } , \\quad     \\sigma_t^2\\equiv\\langle x_t^2\\rangle=\\theta t. \\label{eq : dy2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the variance @xmath15 ( [ eq : dy2 ] ) of the pdf ( [ eq : dy ] ) increases linearly in time , while @xmath16 .",
    "the three parameters of the model are @xmath10 , @xmath8 and @xmath17 . at short and long time lags , the pdf ( [ eq : dy ] )",
    "reduces to exponential ( if @xmath18 ) and gaussian @xcite : @xmath19 in both limits , it scales with the volatility : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the exponential or the gaussian function .",
    "we analyzed the data from jan/1993 to jan/2000 for @xmath22 dow companies , but show results only for four large cap companies : intel ( intc ) and microsoft ( msft ) traded at nasdaq , and ibm and merck ( mrk ) traded at nyse .",
    "we use two databases , taq to construct the intraday returns and yahoo database for the interday returns .",
    "the intraday time lags were chosen at multiples of 5 minutes , which divide exactly the 6.5 hours ( 390 minutes ) of the trading day .",
    "the interday returns are as described in @xcite for time lags from 1 day to 1 month = 20 trading days .    in order to connect the interday and intraday data",
    ", we have to introduce an effective overnight time lag @xmath23 . without this correction ,",
    "the open - to - close and close - to - close variances would have a discontinuous jump at 1 day , as shown in the inset of the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] . by taking the open - to - close time to be 6.5 hours , and the close - to - close time to be 6.5 hours + @xmath23",
    ", we find that variance @xmath24 is proportional to time @xmath0 , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] .",
    "the slope gives us the heston parameter @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dy2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath23 is about 2 hours ( see table [ parameters ] ) .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] , we show the log - linear plots of the cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) vs.  normalized return @xmath25 . the @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 , and we show @xmath26 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 . we observe that cdfs for different time lags @xmath0 collapse on a single straight line without any further fitting ( the parameter @xmath8 is taken from the fit in the left panel ) .",
    "more than 99% of the probability in the central part of the tent - shape distribution function is well described by the exponential function . moreover ,",
    "the collapsed cdf curves agree with the dy formula ( [ short - long ] ) @xmath31 in the short - time limit for @xmath32 @xcite , which is shown by the dashed lines .    .fitting parameters of the heston model with @xmath32 for the 19931999 data .",
    "[ parameters ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     because the parameter @xmath10 drops out of the asymptotic eq .",
    "( [ short - long ] ) , it can be determined only from the crossover regime between short and long times , which is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : thpk ] .",
    "we determine @xmath10 by fitting the characteristic function @xmath33 , a fourier transform of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "the theoretical characteristic function of the heston model is @xmath35 ( [ eq : dy ] )",
    ". the empirical characteristic functions ( ecfs ) can be constructed from the data series by taking the sum @xmath36 over all returns @xmath37 for a given @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "fits of ecfs to the dy formula ( [ eq : dy ] ) are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : thpk ] .",
    "the parameters determined from the fits are given in table [ parameters ] .",
    "in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : pdfcdf ] we compare the empirical pdf @xmath13 with the dy formula ( [ eq : dy ] ) .",
    "the agreement is quite good , except for the very short time lag of 5 minutes , where the tails are visibly fatter than exponential . in order to make a more detailed comparison",
    ", we show the empirical cdfs ( points ) with the theoretical dy formula ( lines ) in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfcdf ] .",
    "we see that , for micro time lags of the order of 5 minutes , the power - law tails are significant",
    ". however , for meso time lags , the cdfs fall onto straight lines in the log - linear plot , indicating exponential law . for even longer time lags ,",
    "they evolve into the gaussian distribution in agreement with the dy formula ( [ eq : dy ] ) for the heston model .",
    "to illustrate the point further , we compare empirical and theoretical data for several other companies in fig .",
    "[ fig : many ] .    in the empirical cdf plots ,",
    "we actually show the ranking plots of log - returns @xmath37 for a given @xmath0 .",
    "so , each point in the plot represents a single instance of price change .",
    "thus , the last one or two dozens of the points at the far tail of each plot constitute a statistically small group and show large amount of noise .",
    "statistically reliable conclusions can be made only about the central part of the distribution , where the points are dense , but not about the far tails .",
    "we have shown that in the mesoscopic range of time lags , the probability distribution of financial returns interpolates between exponential and gaussian law . the time range where the distribution is exponential depends on a particular company , but it is typically between an hour and few days .",
    "similar exponential distributions have been reported for the indian @xcite , japanese @xcite , german @xcite , and brazilian markets @xcite , as well as for the us market @xcite ( see also fig . 2.12 in @xcite ) . the dy formula @xcite for the heston model @xcite captures the main features of the probability distribution of returns from an hour to a month with a single set of parameters .",
    "we believe that econophysicists should be aware of the presence of the exponential distribution and recognize it as another `` stylized fact '' in the set of analytical tools for financial data analysis ."
