    "enough , one finds that these theories always contain fields that transform simultaneously under the anomalous u(1 ) and the standard model ( sm ) group .",

    "this tadpole is quadratically divergent and thus @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the cut - off of the theory . in string theories",
    "the generated fi - term can be calculated with a stringy regularization and is given by @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the string scale . in the weakly - coupled heterotic string , @xmath14 is related to the reduced planck scale @xmath15 gev by @xmath16 and therefore we have @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",

    "@xcite ; the vevs of eqs .",
    "( [ vacuums ] ) and ( [ vacuum ] ) are just shifted by the gravity corrections .",
    "the only noticeable effect is a tadpole for @xmath20 generated from the bilinear soft - term @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the gravitino mass .",
    "thus , @xmath20 gets a nonzero vev given by @xmath37 the fact that the vev of @xmath20 is smaller than that of @xmath19 ( since @xmath38 ) will have important phenomenological consequences .",
    "let us comment on the origin of the small mass - parameter @xmath25 .",
    "it can be generated dynamically @xcite .",
    "for example , it can arises from a field condensation , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are some fields that transform under a strongly interacting gauge group @xcite . in section  4 and the appendix",
    "we show some examples .",
    "if @xmath25 is dynamical , the minimization of the full potential is slightly different from the case above in which we took @xmath25 as a frozen parameter .",
    "we find ( see appendix ) that supersymmetry is always broken , although the vev of @xmath20 can not be exactly determined since it depends on unknown nonperturbative effects .",
    "we , however , estimate that @xmath42 takes a value between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "alternatively , one can consider that @xmath25 arises from a higher dimensional operator suppressed by powers of the planck scale .",
    "for example , a superpotential term such as @xmath45 leads to an effective @xmath25 of order @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "notice that this option does not need for nonperturbative dynamics to generate a scale smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "this is possible due to the fact that the fi - term is generated at the one - loop level and this introduces a new scale in the theory @xmath48 .",
    "although possible , we do not find the latter approach very appealing since it requires a very peculiar charge assignment @xmath49 .",
    "any scalar field in the theory charged under the anomalous u(1 ) receive soft supersymmetry breaking masses from the vev of the @xmath7-term : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the u(1)-charge of @xmath52 . the pattern of soft masses of eq .",
    "( [ dtermmass ] ) has very interesting consequences .",

    "therefore , the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) implies that the soft masses are rg invariant up to corrections of @xmath62 .",
    "these corrections , however , are small since gaugino masses and trilinears do not receive contributions from the @xmath7-terms ; they will be generated from gravity contributions as in ref .",
    "@xcite , or at a higher loop - order as we will see in the next section .",
    "the above has important phenomenological implications .",
    "if we assume that the first and second families are equally charged under the u(1 ) , then the squarks and sleptons will be degenerate at the scale @xmath63 .",
    "the running from the scale @xmath63 to lower scales will not modify the scalar masses , since , as we said , they are renormalization - scale invariant for @xmath64 . therefore , even if at a high energy all the yukawa coupling are of @xmath65 as in certain theories of flavor @xcite , the squarks will keep their degeneracy at lower energies .",
    "this property can avoid the supersymmetric flavor problem @xcite .",
    "these models do not suffer from the effect of ref .",
    "@xcite , even though the supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the sm fields at high energies .",
    "of course , this will be true up to gravitational corrections .",
    "the squark masses receive gravity contributions that , for nonminimal khler potential , are nonuniversal @xcite .",

    "the scalar - component vev of @xmath20 will give a supersymmetric mass to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , while the @xmath33-component vev of @xmath20 will induce a mass splitting inside the scalar components of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 and @xmath70 can act as messengers and transmit the supersymmetry breaking to the sm fields .",
    "like ordinary models with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking , the gaugino masses will be given at the one - loop level @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the dynkin index of the @xmath69-representation of the gauge group @xmath59 .",
    "scalar masses will arise at the two - loop level @xmath77 this contribution is universal for fields with equal quantum numbers ; therefore it does not induce flavor - violating interactions .",

    "( [ varepsilon ] ) that both scenarios can accommodate @xmath88 .      here",
    "we present a model of gauge - mediation that , at the same time , addresses the problem of the generation of the small scale @xmath25 .",
    "the model has the minimal gauge group and field content necessary to break supersymmetry dynamically and transmit it by gauge interactions to the sm fields @xcite .",

    "add to the sm fields , the following field content : @xmath92 with the classical superpotential @xmath93 this simple model leads to dynamical supersymmetry breaking with @xmath69 and @xmath94 playing the role of condensates and messengers . to show that",

    "classically the vacuum manifold ( moduli space ) has a flat direction parameterized by the expectation value of @xmath19 . along this branch @xmath69 and @xmath95 are massive , @xmath96 , and can be integrated out . for @xmath97",
    "the low - energy theory is a pure super - yang - mills theory with a massless chiral superfield @xmath19 ( and , of course , all the sm states ) .",
    "gaugino condensation in the strongly coupled group , @xmath98 , induces the nonperturbative superpotential @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the low - energy scale of the su(n ) theory .",
    "this scale is @xmath19-dependent ; the explicit dependence can be found by the one - loop matching of the gauge coupling in the low and the high energy theories at the scale @xmath19 @xcite . by doing this",
    "we arrive to the following effective low - energy superpotential : @xmath101 the superpotential ( [ efsuperw ] ) leads to spontaneous supersymmetry breaking if @xmath19 gets a nonzero vev .",
    "this is the case as soon as the anomalous @xmath7-term is switched - on . and the dilaton ; the remaining combination is a light field .",
    "so strictly speaking , the question becomes linked to the story of dilaton stabilization , which we will not analyze here ; we are assuming that the dilaton is stabilized by some dynamics which _ per se _ preserves supersymmetry . ]",
    "the pattern of the induced soft masses is like that in the scenario ( a ) .",
    "the superpotential ( [ efsuperw ] ) can also be derived by adding the instanton - generated superpotential ( for @xmath102 ) @xcite @xmath103 and solving the equations of motion for the mesons @xmath104 ( see appendix ) .",
    "for @xmath105 the same can be done but using the quantum modified constraint @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are baryons . note that if all the other states charged under the su(5)@xmath90 are neutral under the u(1 ) , then anomaly cancellation by the green - schwarz mechanism @xcite requires @xmath105 .",
    "this case ( @xmath105 ) shares some similarity with the models of ref .",
    "the only difference resides in the mechanism that stabilizes @xmath19 at some large value . in the models of ref .",
    "@xcite this stabilization was achieved by the khler renormalization as in the witten `` inverse hierarchy '' model @xcite . due to the logarithmic nature of this effects",
    "the stabilization is only possible for @xmath105 ( when the superpotential is linear ) . in our case",
    "@xmath109 is imposed by the u(1 ) @xmath7-term and supersymmetry can be broken for arbitrary @xmath110 as well .",
    "the above conclusions can be trivially generalized for arbitrary higher dimensional couplings @xmath111 this will lead to the change @xmath112 in the effective superpotential ( [ efsuperw ] ) .    the question of whether the gauge contribution to the scalar soft masses dominate over the gravity contribution is directly linked to the value of @xmath8 .",
    "this is the subject on which we will not speculate much here .",
    "just note that , _ a priori _ , the fi - term can be generated in the low - energy limit of some anomaly - free theory , after integrating out the heavy modes , provided that the light ones have tr@xmath113 .",
    "obviously , such a situation is impossible within a four - dimensional field theory with unbroken supersymmetry , since the massive chiral superfields appear in pairs with opposite charges and do not contribute to tr@xmath4 . nevertheless , the situation is different if the theory changes dimensionality below the integration scale , _",
    "e.g. _ , if the four - dimensional chiral theory with tr@xmath113 is obtained by compactifying some higher odd - dimensional one .",
    "since the original theory is anomaly free , the anomaly in the daughter chiral theory must be cancelled by an effective green - schwarz term @xcite ; the quadratic divergence of the one - loop diagram that induces the @xmath7-term must cancel out for momenta larger than the inverse of the radius of compactification @xmath114 ( the localization width in the extra dimension(s ) ) .",
    "the resulting fi - term then must be controlled by the radius @xmath114 and can be small if @xmath115 is large .",
    "in particular , in the m - theory picture @xcite , where the scales are more flexible , the value of the fi - term may be smaller .",
    "if some of the sm fields are charged under the u(1 ) , the supersymmetry breaking will be transmitted by the u(1 ) and the gauge interactions .",
    "scalar masses ( of the u(1)-charged fields ) will arise from eq .",
    "( [ dtermmass ] ) while gaugino masses from eq .",
    "( [ gauginos ] ) .",
    "we can see that there is a hierarchy of soft masses , @xmath116 . for the scenario ( a ) ,",
    "the scalar masses are two orders of magnitude larger than the gaugino masses . if only the first and second families are charged under the u(1 ) , this hierarchy can aminorate the flavor and cp supersymmetric problem @xcite .",
    "if also the third family and the higgs are charged , we have in the scenario ( a ) that either we take @xmath117 gev and the gaugino masses are too small ( see table  [ table ] ) , or we take @xmath118 tev ) and the weak scale ( that is related to the higgs soft mass ) is too large .",
    "thus , a large degree of fine tuning is required in this case . in the scenario ( b ) , this fine tuning problem is aminorited since the scalar masses of the fields charged under the u(1 ) are only slightly larger than the gaugino masses ( depending on the value of @xmath119 as can be seen in table  [ table ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to have @xmath120 in a natural way if the sm higgs arise as pgbs from the breaking of some symmetry realized at high energies .",
