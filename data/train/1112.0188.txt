    "a major breakthrough in the understanding of superconductivity is definitely due to the wave function ansatz proposed by bardeen , cooper , schrieffer @xcite .",
    "the great advantage of this ansatz is that it leads to results in agreement with experiments through calculations quite easy to perform analytically .",
    "its standard form in the grand canonical ensemble as a sum of states with different particle numbers , makes the pauli exclusion principle between paired up and down spin electrons straightforward to handle .",
    "calculations in the grand canonical ensemble however mask the key role played by the pauli exclusion principle in superconductivity .",
    "indeed , due to the very peculiar form of the reduced bcs potential  an up spin electron @xmath1 can interact with a down spin electron @xmath2 only  pauli blocking is the only way two correlated electron pairs can feel each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shiva ] ) .",
    "this in particular explains why cooper pairs can strongly overlap witho ut dissociating , by contrast with excitons which dissociate into an electron - hole plasma @xcite through a mott transition when overlap starts .     and",
    "a down spin electron @xmath3 can not interact by the reduced bcs potential because this would impose @xmath4 .",
    "the two up spin electrons would then have the same momentum which is impossible due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "[ fig : shiva],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to better understand the key role played by the pauli exclusion principle in the physics of bcs superconductors , it is necessary to stay in the canonical ensemble , with a pair number and a number of states available for pairing fixed .",
    "however , to exactly handle pauli blocking between a fixed number of paired fermions like excitons or cooper pairs , is far from easy .",
    "there were , in the past , several discussions on the exact particle - conserving solution within the reduced bcs potential using richardson - gaudin procedure@xciteand its difference with the bcs ansatz @xcite .",
    "most discussions on the ground state however focus on recovering the correct energy or some physical quantities , like the integrals of motion ( @xcite ) , instead of the wave function itself . yet",
    ", the bcs ansatz wave function is strongly linked to the picture people commonly have of superconductivity .    during the last decade",
    ", we developed a many - body formalism appropriate to composite bosons made of fermion pairs@xcite .",
    "up to now , we have extensively studied excitons and developed a formalism adapted to their many - body physics . because the long - range coulomb interaction between electrons and holes leads to a mott dissociation of the exciton gas into an electron - hole plasma @xcite when the density increases , the relevant exciton regime is the dilute regime .",
    "by contrast , the relevant regime in bcs superconductivity is the dense regime with cooper pair wave functions strongly overlapping . as a result",
    ", the many - body physics of composite bosons like cooper pairs is expected to have some similarities with the one of excitons , but with a few major differences .    in section",
    "ii , we develop a commutator formalism for paired electrons capable to handle the pauli exclusion principle within a @xmath0-pair condensate , in an exact way .    in section iii",
    ", we come back to the bcs ansatz in its grand canonical form and we briefly rederive through the standard grand canonical procedure , some textbook results @xcite on quantities we are going to consider in the canonical ensemble , namely , the @xmath5-state population , the pair number mean value , its fluctuations , and the two - pair correlation function .    in section iv , we turn to the canonical ensemble , with a fixed number of pairs . through a direct study of the probability distribution for @xmath0-pair states in the bcs ansatz , we prove that this ansatz indeed corresponds to a distribution very much peaked on a particular value @xmath6 of the pair number , as a result of the `` moth - eaten effect '' induced on cooper pairs by the pauli exclusion principle@xcite .",
    "the standard derivation of this result , through the fluctuations of the pair number around its mean value@xcite , completely hides the microscopic origin of this maximum .    in section",
    "v , we calculate the fraction of the @xmath5 electron state occupied in a @xmath0-pair state . we do show that it is identical to the one calculated within the grand canonical version of the ansatz for @xmath7 .",

    "this shows that the @xmath34 s are linked by @xmath40 eq.([fn ] ) also shows that @xmath34 is a decreasing function of @xmath0 : the moth - eaten effect gets larger and larger when @xmath0 increases .",
    "indeed , the last matrix element is positive as seen by expanding it on free pair operators ; this matrix element then reads @xmath41 the sum being taken over different @xmath42 due to the pauli exclusion principle .",

    "the @xmath5 electron distribution in the @xmath55 state is easy to find as @xmath56 as a result , the @xmath57 distribution of the correlated pair operator @xmath58 defined in eq.([c ] ) is related to the mean value @xmath59 of the number of up _ or _ down",
    "spin electrons @xmath60 in the @xmath55 state through @xmath61    turning to the fluctuation of this mean value , we find that it reads @xmath62 since each sum over @xmath5 is proportional to the sample volume , the above ratio goes to zero in the large sample limit as 1 over the volume .",
    "so , this fluctuation is indeed very small which proves that the @xmath0 distribution in the @xmath55 state is very much peaked on its mean value @xmath59 .",
    "we can also consider the mean value of the two - pair operator @xmath63 in the @xmath55 state .",
    "for @xmath64 , we find @xmath65 where @xmath66 , often called `` pair wave function '' , is defined as @xmath67",
    "the above calculation of the @xmath59 fluctuation using the grand canonical form @xmath55 of the bcs ansatz as a @xmath52 product is quite convincing to conclude that the @xmath0-pair state distribution in this ansatz is very much peaked on the @xmath0 mean value .",
    "however , a direct calculation of the probability distribution , using the @xmath0 sum @xmath68 , is of interest to understand the microscopic origin of this peaked value .",
    "if we only consider the @xmath69 prefactor in the @xmath68 sum , we could navely conclude that the @xmath35 state dominates the sum .",
    "however , in order for the prefactors of the @xmath0-pair state in the @xmath68 expansion to have some physical meaning , this @xmath0-pair state must be normalized .    to do it ,",
    "we first introduce the normalized correlated pair operator @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , in order to have @xmath73 .",
    "the normalized @xmath0-pair state associated to the @xmath58 correlated pair operator then reads latexmath:[\\[\\label{psin }    with @xmath34 defined as in eq.(12 ) , in order to have @xmath75 .",

    "so , the ratio @xmath81 also decreases when @xmath0 increases . in order to show that this decrease is compensated by the increase of @xmath82 in order for @xmath83",
    "to be possibly peaked , we first note that the sum @xmath84 is larger than @xmath85 since @xmath86 so @xmath87 is smaller than 1 . as a result , @xmath88 and @xmath82 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "this @xmath82 increase first dominates the @xmath80 decrease since , due to the stirling formula , @xmath89 .",
    "so , in the absence of the @xmath34 factor , the @xmath83 probability distribution distribution would be peaked on @xmath90 , which is far larger than the pair number mean value @xmath59 .",
    "the moth - eaten effect induced by pauli blocking on cooper pairs is responsible for bringing the @xmath83 peak back to @xmath59 , through the @xmath34 decrease it induces . to show it",
    ", we first note that this @xmath34 decrease does not affect the @xmath83 behavior so much for small @xmath0 since , as seen from eq.([fn ] ) , @xmath91 stays close to 1 for small @xmath0 .",
    "by contrast , @xmath34 is going to play a key role for large @xmath0 s by changing the peak of the probability distribution from @xmath92 to @xmath6 which , as a definition of the @xmath83 peak , must be such that @xmath93 .",
    "eq.([phibcs ] ) then gives @xmath94 if cooper pairs were elementary bosons , @xmath34 would stay equal to 1 for all @xmath0 and the peak of the @xmath83 distribution would take place for a pair number equal to @xmath95 which is far larger than @xmath59 .",
    "for composite bosons , the @xmath91 ratio is smaller than 1 since @xmath34 decreases with @xmath0 , as previously shown ; so , @xmath83 is peaked on a @xmath0 value smaller than s.    if the @xmath6 peak were in the dilute regime , the @xmath34 ratio would be close to 1 and @xmath6 would be close to @xmath96 .",
    "this shows that the solution of eq.([xn ] ) is in the dense regime , with @xmath91 substantially smaller than 1 .",
    "this has to be contrasted to excitons for which the @xmath91 ratios always are close to 1 : at large density , excitons would dissociate into an electron - hole plasma@xcite .",
    "more demanding is to go further and to precisely relate the pair number @xmath97 corresponding to the @xmath83 maximum to the pair number mean value @xmath59 calculated within the @xmath52 product form of the bcs ansatz . with this goal in mind , let us first calculate the @xmath5 electron state population in the @xmath98 condensate .",
