    "the study of quantum entanglement is both of practical and theoretical significance : entanglement is viewed as a physical resource for quantum - information processing and it constitutes a major issue in the foundations of quantum theory .",

    "@xcite ) ; however , there are useful separability criteria and entanglement measures for bipartite states , pure and mixed @xcite ) .",
    "realistic quantum systems , including multipartite ones , can not avoid interactions with their environments , which can degrade their quantum coherence and entanglement .",
    "thus quantum decoherence and disentanglement are obstacles to quantum - information processing @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , some environments act as intermediates that generate entanglement in multipartite systems , even if the components do not interact directly @xcite .",
    "the theoretical study of entanglement dynamics in open quantum systems has uncovered important physical effects , such as the sudden death of entanglement @xcite , entanglement revival after sudden death @xcite , the significance of non - markovian effects @xcite , the possibility of a rich phase structure for the asymptotic behavior of entanglement @xcite , and intricacies in the evolution of entanglement in multipartite systems @xcite .    here",
    ", we study entanglement and decoherence in quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) models @xcite , focusing on their description in terms of generalized uncertainty relations .",
    "our main tool in this study is the wigner function propagator .",
    "qbm models are defined by a quadratic total hamiltonian , and they are characterized by a gaussian propagator .",
    "this propagator is solely determined by two matrices : one corresponding to the classical dissipative equations of motion and one containing the effect of environment - induced diffusion . in sec .",
    "ii we provide explicit formulas for their determination .",
    "the simplicity of time evolution in the wigner picture leads to a concise derivation of an exact master equation for general qbm models , with any number of system oscillators and spectral density .",
    "moreover , time evolution in the wigner picture allows for a derivation of generalized uncertainty relations , valid for _ any _ initial state , that incorporate the influence of the environment upon the system .",
    "these uncertainty relations generalize the ones of ref .",
    "@xcite to qbm models with an arbitrary number of system oscillators  see also refs . @xcite .",
    "their most important feature is that the lower bound is independent of the initial state , and for this reason , they allow for general statements about the process of decoherence and thermalization .",
    "the uncertainty relations are also related to separability criteria for bipartite systems @xcite .",
    "hence , they provide an important tool for the study of entanglement dynamics . for gaussian states , in particular , the uncertainty relations , derived here , provide a general characterization of processes such as entanglement creation and disentanglement without the need to specify detailed properties of the initial state",
    ". however , uncertainty relations do not suffice to distinguish all entangled _ non - gaussian _ states . for such states ,",
    "the description of entanglement dynamics from the uncertainty relations is rather partial , but still leads to nontrivial results .",
    "the uncertainty relations derived in this article apply to any open quantum system characterized by gaussian propagation , and they are expressed solely in terms of the coefficients of the wigner function propagator .",
    "they can be used for the study of entanglement dynamics , not only in bipartite but also in multipartite systems . to demonstrate their usefulness",
    ", we apply them to a concrete bipartite qbm model system that has been studied by paz and roncanglia @xcite . in this model , there exist two coupled subalgebras of observables , only one of which couples directly to the environment . for a special case of the system parameters , considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of the subalgebras is completely decoupled , and thus there exists a decoherence - free subspace for the system .",
    "here we focus on the generic case , also explored in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we find that in the high - temperature regime , decoherence and disentanglement are generic and the uncertainty relations allow for an identification of the characteristic timescales , which in some cases may be of very different orders of magnitude . at low temperature ,",
    "entanglement creation often occurs and we demonstrate that it is accompanied by `` entanglement oscillations '' , that is , a sequence of entanglement sudden death and revivals at early times . in this regime , there is no decoherence , and disentanglement arises because of relaxation . at a time scale of the order of relaxation time the system tends to a unique asymptotic state , which coincides with a thermal state at the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the generalized uncertainty relations allow for the determination of upper limits to disentanglement time with respect to all gaussian initial states .",
    "the structure of the article is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we construct the wigner function propagator for the most general qbm model and we provide explicit formulas for the propagator s coefficients .",
    "the master equation is then simply obtained from the propagator . in sec .",
    "iii we construct the generalized uncertainty relations valid for all qbm models , we show that they can be used for the study of multipartite entanglement , and we then consider their special case in the model of refs . @xcite . in sec .",
    "iv we employ the uncertainty relations for the study of decoherence , disentanglement , and entanglement creation in different regimes and time scales of this model .",
    "in this section , we consider the most general setup for quantum brownian motion , namely , a system of @xmath0 harmonic oscillators of masses @xmath1 and frequencies @xmath2 interacting with a heat bath .",
    "the heat bath is modeled by a set of harmonic oscillators of masses @xmath3 and frequencies @xmath4 , initially at a thermal state of temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the total system is a sum of three terms @xmath6 , where @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the position and momentum operators for the system oscillators and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the position and momentum operators for the environment oscillator .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) involves different couplings @xmath12 of each system oscillators to the bath .",
    "thus it can also be used to describes systems different from the classic setup of brownian motion , for example , particle detectors at different locations interacting with a quantum field @xcite .    for an initial state that is factorized in system and environment degrees of freedom",
    "the evolution of the reduced density matrix for the system variables is _ autonomous _ , and it can be expressed in terms of a master equation .",
    "for the issues we explore in this article , in particular entanglement dynamics , the determination of the propagator of the reduced density matrix is more important than the construction of the master equation , because it allows us to follow the time evolution of the relevant observables .",
    "the construction of the propagator is simpler in the wigner picture .    instead of the density operator , we work with the wigner function , defined by @xmath13 its inverse is @xmath14    for a factorized initial state , time evolution in qbm models",

    "in qbm models the wigner function propagator is gaussian .",
    "this follows from the fact that the total hamiltonian for the system is quadratic and the initial state for the bath is gaussian .",

    "( [ gauss ] ) preserves its dependence on the initial variables even for @xmath181 . as a consequence ,",
    "an asymptotic state may not exist or , if it exists , it may not be unique .",
    "hence , in this case asymptotic entanglement or a sequence of entanglement death and revivals is possible .    nonetheless , the case of a unique asymptotic state is the generic one .",
    "dissipation - free subspaces exist only for a set of measure zero in the space of parameters ( e.g. , system - environment couplings ) characterizing a qbm model .",
    "for example , even a small dependence of the coupling on the oscillator s position will prevent the existence of a dissipation - free subspace . hence , unless some symmetry can be invoked that fully protects a subalgebra from degradation from the environment , we expect that the relaxation time sets an absolute upper limit to the time scale that entanglement can be preserved in any oscillator system interacting with a qbm - type environment",
    ".      in general , two noninteracting quantum systems may become entangled by their interaction with a third system . in qbm",
    "the role of the third system can be played by the environment , and indeed , low - temperature baths have the tendency to create entanglement .    the uncertainty relations eqs .",
    "( [ gunc3 ] ) and ( [ gunc4 ] ) are particularly useful for the study of entanglement creation . we apply them as follows .",
    "the positivity of the matrix @xmath182 is a necessary criterion for a state to be factorized at time @xmath23 .",
    "hence , in a factorized state , the minimal eigenvalue @xmath183 of @xmath182 is positive . by eq .",
    "( [ gunc3 ] ) , @xmath183 is always bounded from below by the minimal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath184 , which we denote as @xmath185 . hence , the function @xmath185 determines the capacity of the environment to create entanglement irrespective of the initial state .",
    "in particular , the condition that @xmath186 implies that at least some factorized states can develop entanglement at time @xmath23 .    figure 2(b ) provides a plot of the minimal eigenvalue @xmath183 of @xmath182 for an initial factorized gaussian state together with the lower bound , @xmath185 , as functions of time .",
    "@xmath183 oscillates rapidly at a scale of @xmath187 , so that at time scale of order @xmath146 we can distinguish only two enveloping curves that bound it from above and below . @xmath185 is close to the lower enveloping curve of @xmath183 and we note that at specific instants the inequality @xmath188 is saturated .    for gaussian states",
    "the criterion @xmath189 completely specifies entanglement , hence , for times @xmath23 that @xmath190 , no initially factorized gaussian state can sustain entanglement . in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 3 , we see that @xmath185 exhibits oscillations around zero at low temperatures .",
    "this implies that , at least for gaussian states , entanglement creation at low temperature is typically accompanied by a period of `` entanglement oscillations '' , that is , a sequence of entanglement deaths and revivals , which terminates at a time scale of order @xmath146 , when the system relaxes to an asymptotic factorized state .",
    "figure 2(a ) provides a plot of @xmath183 for an initial factorized energy eigenstate @xmath191 , together with the bound @xmath185 .",
    "for non - gaussians , a positive value of @xmath183 does not imply factorizability of the state ; information about entanglement is carried in higher order correlation functions of the system . nonetheless , a negative value of @xmath192 is a definite sign of entanglement . despite of the fact that @xmath183 saturates the bound at some instants , in general",
    "its behavior is qualitatively different .    in fig .",
    "3 , the minimal eigenvalue @xmath185 is plotted for different values of temperature . with increasing temperature the time intervals of persisting entanglement",
    "shrink and the entanglement oscillations are suppressed . at sufficiently high temperature ( of order @xmath193 ) , no creation of entanglement occurs .",
    "we saw that at high temperature , the noise from the environment degrades the quantum state and causes rapid decoherence and disentanglement . at low temperatures ( @xmath194 ) , however , the noise is not sufficiently strong to cause decoherence @xcite , and entanglement is preserved longer .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for disentanglement at low - temperature is relaxation : the existence of a unique asymptotic factorized state implies that at a time scale of order @xmath146 all memory of the initial state ( including entanglement ) is lost . in other words ,",
    "a low temperature bath is much more efficient in creating and preserving entanglement , but relaxation to equilibrium will inevitably lead to a factorized state .    by eq .",
    "( [ gunc1 ] ) , the minimal eigenvalue @xmath183 of the matrix @xmath182 is always bounded from below by the minimal eigenvalue @xmath195 of the matrix @xmath196 .",
    "hence , the condition @xmath197 is sufficient for the existence of entangled states at time @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the condition @xmath198 establishes that the evolution of any _ gaussian _ initial state at time @xmath23 is factorized .",
    "figure 4 contains plots of the minimal eigenvalue @xmath183 of @xmath182 for two different initial states , together with the lower bound @xmath195 . in fig .",
    "4(a ) the initial state is an entangled gaussian , and in fig .",
    "4(b ) the initial state is @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is a coherent state .",
    "in both cases , @xmath183 approaches the lower bound only after a time scale of order @xmath146 when the system has started relaxation to a unique asymptotic state .",
    "we note that there are no entanglement oscillations for such states , only a gradual decay of entanglement .",
    "this behavior is typical for initial states that violate eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) by a substantial margin .",
    "however , the uncertainty relations do not provide any significant information about the entanglement dynamics of initial states that are entangled , but do not violate the bound , eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) .",
    "this is the case , for example , for states of the form @xmath201 . in order to study such states",
    ", we would have to obtain generalized uncertainty relations pertaining to correlation functions of order higher than 2 .    in fig .",
    "5 , we plot the minimal eigenvalue @xmath195 as a function of time @xmath23 , for different temperatures .",
    "as expected , the time interval during which the system sustains entangled states [ i.e. , @xmath197 ] shrinks with temperature .",
    "the uncertainty relation , eq .",
    "( [ gunc1 ] ) , allows for the definition of the disentanglement time @xmath158 as the instant that @xmath202 .",
    "thus defined , @xmath158 is an upper bound to the disentanglement time for _ any _ gaussian initial state . in general ,",
    "non - gaussian states may preserve entanglement for times larger than @xmath158 .",
    "however , @xmath158 depends only on the matrices @xmath40 and @xmath58 , and the evolution of higher - order correlation functions of non - gaussian states is governed by the matrices @xmath40 and @xmath58 alone .",
    "moreover , @xmath203 refers to the regime of relaxation to a unique thermal equilibrium state , hence , the loss of any memory of the initial condition . for this reason ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath158 provides a good estimation for disentanglement time that is valid for a larger class of initial states , at least as far as its qualitative dependence on temperature and other bath parameters are concerned .",
    "figure 6 plots @xmath158 as a function of temperature for different values of @xmath204 .",
    "as expected @xmath158 decreases with temperature . however , there is no monotonic dependence of @xmath158 on @xmath204 , and for @xmath205 , @xmath158 is largely insensitive to @xmath204 .",
    "finally , we note that the weaker uncertainty relations for the wigner function areas @xmath206 also provide an estimation for disentanglement time @xmath207 . since these inequalities are weaker , the values of @xmath158 thus obtained are smaller , but their dependence on the parameters @xmath204 and @xmath208 is qualitatively similar .",
    "the main results of our article are the following : ( i ) the explicit construction of the wigner function propagator for qbm models with any number of system oscillators and for any spectral density ; the propagator allows for a simple derivation of the corresponding master equation ; ( ii ) the identification of generalized uncertainty relations valid in any qbm model that provide a state - independent lower bound to the fluctuations induced by the environment ; ( iii ) the application of the uncertainty relations to a concrete model , for the study of decoherence , disentanglement , and entanglement creation in different regimes . in particular",
    ", we showed that entanglement creation is often accompanied by entanglement oscillation at early times and that the uncertainty relations provide an upper bound to disentanglement time with respect to all initial gaussian states .    in our opinion",
    ", the most important feature of the techniques developed in this article is that they can be immediately generalized for addressing more complex systems and issues in the study of entanglement dynamics , for example , in the derivation of uncertainty relations for higher - order correlation functions , or for information - theoretic quantities that contain more detailed information about entanglement of general initial states , and in the exploration of entanglement dynamics in multipartite systems and of the dependence of entanglement on the spatial separation of multipartite systems .",
