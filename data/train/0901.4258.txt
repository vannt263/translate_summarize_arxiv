    "an interesting feature appears on images for @xmath66 ( fig .",

    "there is no ` quadrilateral ' snr reported in the literature .",
    "if there is no such snr at all , the range @xmath71 may be excluded .",

    "[ thetak : fig3 ] shows snr images for quasi - parallel injection with @xmath72 ( upper panel ) and for isotropic injection ( @xmath73 , lower panel ) .",
    "we may expect that ismf may have different orientation versus observer in various snrs .",
    "if quasi - parallel injection is not a rare exception then the polar - cap snrs should be projected in a different way and we may expect to observe not only ` bipolar ' snrs ( fig .",

    "@xcite developed statistically this thought and showed that the quasi - parallel injection model would be unlikely , but again , we would need a complete study to verify this statement .",

    "[ thetak : fig2 ] ) are expected to be fainter than bilateral or circular snrs with the same characteristics ( lines 4 - 6 on fig .",
    "[ thetak : fig2 ] ) : it could be that most of the centrally - peaked snrs may not be observable .",
    "let us consider first the case when the maximum energy of electrons is constant over snr surface ; this allows us to clearly see the role of the injection efficiency and magentic field variations .",

    "namely , the two lobes develop with increasing of @xmath7 in both radio and @xmath0-rays .",

    "fig  [ thetak : fig4]d and fig  [ thetak : fig3]h ) .    the reason of this effect is the following . for assumed isotropic injection , the azimuthal variation of the radio brightness",
    "is determined only by the dependence @xmath4 on obliquity ( the azimuth angle equals to the obliquity angle for @xmath74 ) .",
    "electrons emitting vhe @xmath0-rays have energies @xmath75 and experience substantial radiative losses ( this effect is negligible for radio emitting electrons ) .",
    "magnetic field does not appear directly in the formulae for ic emission , but it affects the downstream distribution of relativistic electrons emitting ic @xmath0-rays .",
    "the larger post - shock magnetic field the larger radiative losses .",
    "the downstream distribution of ic - emitting electrons is therefore steeper where magnetic field is stronger .",
    "this leads to lower ic brightness in snr regions with larger magnetic field ( while radio brightness increases there because of proportionality to @xmath76 ) .    in vhe",
