    "the stellar nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron occurs via neutron capture reactions and subsequent @xmath10 decays . the so - called slow neutron capture process or",
    "@xmath11 process  @xcite takes place in low and intermediate mass stars during their asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "an additional @xmath11-process contribution comes in the helium - burning core and subsequent carbon - burning shell phases of massive stars .",
    "the @xmath5ne(@xmath6)@xmath0 mg reaction constitutes a major neutron source for the @xmath11 process . in agb stars ,",
    "this source is activated during a series of convective he - shell burning episodes , so - called thermal pulses , with temperatures as high as 400 mk ( more than 30 kev thermal energy ) .",
    "although it contributes only about 5% to the total neutron budget , this scenario determines the final abundance pattern .",
    "hence , it is decisive for deriving information on neutron density , temperature , and pressure in the he - burning layers of agb stars  @xcite . in massive stars , where thermal energies of 25 and 90 kev are reached during the he - core and c - shell burning phases ,",
    "the neutron budget is by far dominated by the @xmath5ne(@xmath6)@xmath0 mg reaction .",
    "the @xmath5ne(@xmath6)@xmath0 mg cross section in the temperature regime of the @xmath11 process is affected by unknown resonance contributions .",
    "also the competing @xmath5ne(@xmath7)@xmath2 mg reaction , whose cross section is also insufficiently known , adds to the persistent uncertainty of the neutron budget and the associated neutron densities during stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "the ( @xmath7 ) reaction contributes to the destruction of @xmath5ne during the entire helium burning phase because of its positive @xmath12-value of 10.615 mev , already before the threshold for neutron production via @xmath5ne(@xmath6)@xmath0 mg ( @xmath13 kev ) is reached . in this context , the @xmath0mg(@xmath1)@xmath2 mg reaction plays a non - negligible role as well , because the high @xmath11 abundance of @xmath0 mg makes it a significant neutron poison for the @xmath11 process .",
    "so far , this reaction rate is too uncertain for a quantitative assessment of the poisoning effect  @xcite .",
    "experimental data for the @xmath5ne(@xmath6)@xmath0 mg cross section are essentially limited to @xmath14 energies above about 800 kev . at lower energies",
    "the most recent direct measurements  @xcite provided only an upper limit of about @xmath15 barn , corresponding to the experimental sensitivity .",
    "the lowest resonance observed in direct measurements is at @xmath16 kev ( _ e .",
    "g. _ ref .",
    "since a direct approach is exceedingly difficult , indirect and transfer reactions were considered as an alternative way for constraining the reaction rate at low energies .",
    "for instance , the @xmath14-transfer reaction @xmath5ne(@xmath17li , d)@xmath2 mg has been studied @xcite to search for levels in @xmath2 mg also below the neutron threshold at 11.093 mev .",
    "these studies are particularly relevant for estimating the @xmath5ne(@xmath7)@xmath2 mg rate , where levels below and above the neutron threshold are involved .",
    "direct @xmath5ne(@xmath7)@xmath2 mg measurements have only been carried out above 0.8 mev . in view of the scarce experimental information , evaluations had , therefore , to rely on theoretical estimates .",
    "accordingly , the uncertainties of the stellar @xmath5ne(@xmath6)@xmath0 mg and @xmath5ne(@xmath18 ) rates are still dominated by unknown properties of states in the compound nucleus @xmath2 mg above the @xmath14 threshold at 10.615 mev",

    "[ fig_levels ] , these states can be studied via neutron resonance spectroscopy of @xmath4 mg . in particular , a simultaneous resonance shape analysis of total and capture cross section data can be used to determine the resonance energies , @xmath24 , spin parities , @xmath25 , as well as the capture and neutron widths @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "information from previous @xmath0mg(@xmath1)@xmath2 mg measurements suffers from considerable uncertainties due to sample problems and counting statistics .",
    "moreover , the available transmission data have been obtained with natural mg samples , a serious limitation in view of the dominant abundance of @xmath28 mg in natural magnesium .",
    "the corresponding differences between present and previous transmission results are discussed in ref .",
    "this work on @xmath4 mg combined two neutron time - of - flight measurements , using the cern - n_tof facility  @xcite for the ( @xmath1 ) channel and the gelina accelerator at irmm / geel  @xcite for the total cross section . to avoid the limitations of previous attempts ,",
    "both measurements were carried out with highly enriched , metallic samples ( 97.87% @xmath0 mg ) . the n_tof facility , which provides a white neutron spectrum from thermal energy to about 1-gev neutron energy , was chosen because it is particularly well suited for accurate high - resolution neutron measurements due to its outstanding instantaneous neutron flux ( about @xmath29 neutrons per bunch at the experimental area ) and the very long flight - path of 185 m. the experimental setup was based on two deuterated benzene ( c@xmath30d@xmath30 ) scintillation detectors ( cylindrical cells with an active volume of about 1 liter ) , placed on either side of the neutron beam , 9.0 cm upstream of the sample .",
    "these detectors are characterized by a very small neutron sensitivity .",
    "the chosen geometrical configuration minimized the background due to scattered in - beam @xmath19 rays and reduced systematic effects due to the anisotropy in the angular distribution from primary @xmath19-rays following @xmath31wave neutron resonances .",
    "the total number of neutrons impinging on the various samples used in the measurement was determined by means of a low - mass , @xmath32li - based , neutron detector  @xcite , while the energy dependence of the neutron flux derived from a dedicated study  @xcite . the well - established total energy detection principle in combination with the pulse height weighting technique  @xcite",
    "was applied to make the detection efficiency for a capture event directly proportional to the total @xmath19-ray energy available in the capture event .",
    "moreover the saturated resonance technique  @xcite was used to normalize the capture data .",
    "the measurement covered the energy range from thermal energy to about 300 kev with a resolution of 0.05% to 0.3% in the relevant energy range between 1 and 300 kev .",
    "the total cross section of @xmath4 mg was measured with a @xmath17li - glass detector at the 50 m station of the gelina facility for energies up to about 300 kev .",
    "a combination of li - carbonate plus resin , pb and cu - collimators was used to reduce the neutron beam to a diameter of less than 35 mm at the sample position .",
    "the sample was placed in an automatic sample changer at a distance of 23.78 m from the neutron source .",
    "close to the sample position a @xmath33b anti - overlap filter was placed to absorb slow neutrons from a previous burst . in order to have a well - characterized measurement condition ,",
    "permanent na and co black resonance filters  @xcite were used to continuously monitor the background at 2.85 kev and 132 ev .",
    "additional black resonance filters were used in dedicated runs .",
    "thanks to the small dimensions of the neutron - producing target and the excellent time characteristic ( 1-ns pulse width ) , gelina is particularly suited for high - resolution transmission measurements in the kev region .",
    "essential improvements with respect to the previous capture measurement at n_tof  @xcite are the quality of the highly enriched @xmath0 mg sample and a substantially reduced background of in - beam @xmath19 rays  @xcite .",
    "the total cross section measurement benefits also significantly from the highly enriched sample . in both measurements the experimental background was determined in dedicated runs .",
    "the data reduction for the determination of the cross section starting from detectors counting rate was performed following the procedures described in  @xcite . the capture yield ( representing the fraction of the neutron beam undergoing capture events ) obtained at n_tof and the transmission ( representing the fraction of neutron beam that traverses the sample without interaction ) from gelina",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_captra ] and compared with the results of a simultaneous r - matrix analysis of both data sets .",
    "more in detail , the experimental capture yield @xmath34 , deduced from the response of the capture detection system and the flux - monitor is related to the total and capture cross - sections , @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , by the following expression  @xcite : @xmath37 while the transmission @xmath38 , which was experimentally obtained from the ratio of li - glass spectra resulting from a sample - in and a sample - out measurement , is related to the total cross - section by  @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 atoms / b denotes the areal density of the capture sample and @xmath41 atoms / b the one of the transmission sample , @xmath42 the laboratory neutron energy , and @xmath43 the contribution of multiple interaction in the sample .",
    "this latter term , together with other experimental effects such as self - shielding , doppler broadening and response of the time - of - flight spectrometer , are properly taken into account in the r - matrix codes sammy  @xcite and refit  @xcite used in the present combined analysis .",

    "the information on @xmath44 is particularly important for identifying the states in @xmath2 mg that contribute to the @xmath5ne(@xmath6)@xmath0 mg cross section .",
    "this selection is crucial because @xmath5ne nuclei and @xmath14 particles have both @xmath48 .",
    "accordingly , ( @xmath6 ) reactions can only populate natural - parity states ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , ... ) in @xmath2 mg , whereas the @xmath4 mg reaction proceeds also via @xmath49 states .",

    "@xcite , these two resonances could not be accurately studied by using the transmission data on natural magnesium ( _ e .",

    "this is particularly evident at low metallicities .    using the present upper limits for the @xmath5ne(@xmath65 ) rates ,",
    "the @xmath11-process yields of agb stars between 2 and 5 m@xmath62 and an initial iron fraction corresponding to 0.7% of the solar value were calculated for comparison with reference agb models from the fruity data base @xcite .",
