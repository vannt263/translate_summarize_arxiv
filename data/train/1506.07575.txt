    "the discovery of a light scalar boson @xmath7 of the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) compatible with a sm higgs boson @xcite and with mass around @xmath8@xmath4 has opened a window to new sectors in the search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the higgs boson might be a portal leading to more profound physics models and even physics principles .",
    "therefore , another higgs factory besides the lhc , such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite and the compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite that can study in detail and can precisely determine the properties of the higgs boson is another important future step in high - energy and high - luminosity physics exploration .",
    "the existence of a heavy neutral ( @xmath0 ) vector boson is a feature of many extensions of the standard model . in particular ,",
    "one ( or more ) additional @xmath9 gauge group provides one of the simplest extensions of the sm .",
    "additional @xmath0 gauge bosons appear in grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite , superstring theories @xcite , left - right symmetric models ( lrsm ) @xcite and in other models such as models of composite gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is possible to study some phenomenological features associated with this extra neutral gauge boson by considering a @xmath10 ( baryon number minus lepton number ) model .",
    "the @xmath10 symmetry plays an important role in various physics scenarios beyond the sm : a ) the gauge @xmath11 symmetry group is contained in a gut described by a @xmath12 group @xcite .",
    "b ) the scale of the @xmath10 symmetry breaking is related to the mass scale of the heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos mass terms providing the well - known see - saw mechanism @xcite to explain light left - handed neutrino mass .",
    "c ) the @xmath10 symmetry and the scale of its breaking are tightly connected to the baryogenesis mechanism through leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 model @xcite is attractive due to its relatively simple theoretical structure , and the crucial test of the model is the detection of the new heavy neutral @xmath13 gauge boson .",
    "the analysis of precision electroweak measurements indicates that the new @xmath0 gauge boson should be heavier than about 1.2 @xmath14 @xcite . on the other hand , recent bounds from the lhc",
    "indicate that the @xmath0 gauge boson should be heavier than about 2 @xmath14 @xcite , while future lhc runs at 13 - 14 @xmath14 could increase the @xmath0 mass bounds to higher values , or may be lucky and find evidence for its presence .",
    "further studies of the @xmath0 properties will require a new linear collider @xcite , which will also allow us to perform precision studies of the higgs sector .",
    "detailed discussions on the @xmath10 model can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the higgs - stralung @xcite process @xmath15 is one of the main production mechanisms of the higgs boson in the future linear @xmath6 colliders experiments , such as the ilc and clic .",
    "therefore , after the discovery of the higgs boson , detailed experimental and theoretical studies are necessary for checking its properties and dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is possible to search for the higgs boson in the framework of the b - l model , however the existence of a new gauge boson could also provide new higgs particle production mechanisms , which could prove its non - standard origin . in this work ,",
    "we analyze how the @xmath0 gauge boson of the @xmath11 model could be used as a factory of higgs bosons .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to study the sensitivity of the @xmath0 boson of the b - l model as a higgs boson factory through the higgs - strahlung process @xmath1 , including both the resonant and non - resonant effects at future high - energy and high - luminosity linear @xmath6 colliders , such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite and the compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the total cross section of @xmath2 and we calculate the total number of events for integrated luminosities of 500 - 2000@xmath3 and center - of - mass energies between 500 and 3000@xmath4 . we find that the total number of expected @xmath2 events for the @xmath6 colliders is very promising and that it would be possible to perform precision measurements for both the @xmath0 and higgs boson in the future high - energy @xmath6 colliders experiments .",
