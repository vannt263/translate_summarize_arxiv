    "a multiple sequence alignment ( msa ) of a family of proteins provides us with valuable information to characterize the protein family in terms of patterns of amino acid residues at alignment sites  @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of analyzing the residue compositions in the msa has led to the development of a class of sequence profile methods  @xcite such as psi - blast  @xcite and profile hidden markov models ( hmm )  @xcite , which can be used to detect distantly related proteins , to obtain high - quality alignments , and to improve structure prediction  @xcite as well as to characterize functional and structural roles of the conservation pattern  @xcite . in the sequence profile methods",
    ", it is assumed that the residue composition of each site is independent of other sites . with this crude assumption ,",
    "the conservation of residues are explained in terms of their functional and structural roles .",
    "however , to further understand the mechanism of these roles in the context of protein sequences , one needs to drop the assumption of site independence .",
    "in fact , there seems to be no way for a residue to `` know '' that it is in a particular position in the sequence to play a particular functional or structural role other than by its interactions with other residues in the sequence ( or with other molecules in the biological system ) .",
    "therefore , to understand what makes particular residues important at each site , one needs to study the correlations between different sites .",
    "correlations between distant sites in a msa can be quantified by identifying correlated substitutions .",
    "they have been exploited to gain further insights of structures and functions of proteins  @xcite . however , the apparent correlations observed in a msa are only a result of intricate interactions between residues as in the underlying native structures of proteins .",
    "recently , there have been a number of successful attempts to extract direct correlations  @xcite which are in fact found to be in excellent agreement with the residue - residue contacts in native structures  @xcite to the extent that the three - dimensional structures can be actually ( re)constructed  @xcite .",
    "one drawback of the direct - coupling analysis ( as well as other direct correlation methods ) is that it takes into account only those alignment sites that are well aligned ( the `` core '' sites ) , and ignores insertions .",
    "the primary difficulty in the treatment of insertion is that they are of variable lengths , which makes the system size variable and hence greatly complicates the problem .",
    "when one is interested in some universal properties of a protein family such as their approximate three - dimensional fold , insertions may be irrelevant",
    ". however , when one is interested in a particular member of the family , the existence of some insertions may be important .",
    "in fact , insertions , which may be regarded as `` embellishments '' to a conserved structural core , are deemed to be an effective strategy for proteins to diversify and specialize their functions  @xcite .",
    "some insertions are also known to play critical roles in protein oligomerization  @xcite . of more fundamental concern",
    "is that ignoring insertions in a msa means ignoring the polypeptide chain structure , which implies theoretical as well as practical consequences .",
    "theoretically , it is questionable to ignore such a strong interaction as the peptide bond in order to accurately describe the sequence and structure of proteins .",
    "practically , in order to identify new members of a family by aligning their sequences to some msa - derived model incorporating direct correlations , a consistent treatment of polypeptide sequences is necessary .    in this paper ,",
    "i present a new statistical model of the msa that incorporates both direct correlations and insertions .",
    "the main objective of this model is incorporation of long - range correlations into multiple - sequence alignment , rather than improving contact prediction by incorporating insertions .",
    "as will be apparent from the formulation , this model is a generalization of the direct - coupling analysis that is based on the principle of maximum entropy  @xcite .",
    "this model can be regarded as a finite , quasi - one - dimensional , multicomponent , and heterogeneous lattice gas model where the `` particles '' are amino acid residues . in the following , the `` lattice gas model '' refers to this model .",
    "the lattice system consists of two kinds of lattice sites , corresponding to the core ( matching or deletion ) or the insert , that are connected in a similar , but distinctively different , manner as in the profile hmm model .",
    "while long - range interactions are treated by using a mean - field approximation , short - range interactions are treated rigorously so that the partition function is obtained analytically by a transfer matrix method .",
    "one notable feature of this model is that its partition function literally accounts for all the possible alignments with all the possible protein sequences , including infinitely long ones .",
    "based on this model , various virtual experiments can be performed by changing the `` temperature '' of the system or by manipulating the `` chemical potentials '' associated with the particles ( residues ) at each site .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , some basic quantities are defined and the lattice gas model of the multiple sequence alignment is formulated . section [ sec : materials ] provides the details of numerical methods and data preparation .",
    "section [ sec : results ] gives the results of virtual experiments by increasing the temperature or by introducing alanine point mutants .",
    "in section [ sec : discussion ] , limitations , implications as well as possible extensions of the present model are discussed .",
    "the lattice structure of the model .",
    "the squares marked with @xmath0 correspond to core ( matching / deletion ) sites , the diamonds marked with @xmath1 correspond to insert sites .",
    "the edges between sites indicates bonded interactions .",
    "see figure [ fig : alignment ] for concrete examples.,width=302 ]      a msa may be regarded as a matrix of symbols in which each row is a protein sequence possibly with gaps and each column is an alignment site .",
    "some columns may contain few gaps so the residues in such positions may be relatively important for the protein family . here",
    ", i informally define a `` core '' ( matching / deletion ) site as an alignment site which are relatively well aligned .",
    "the remaining sites are defined to be insert sites .",
    "core sites are ordered from the n - terminal to the c - terminal , and denoted as @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the number of core sites . for convenience ,",
    "the terminal core sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 are appended to indicate the start and end of the alignment , as in the profile hmm  @xcite . to each core site , either one of 20 amino acid residues or a gap ( deletion ) may be assigned , and the latter is treated as the 21-st type of residue .",
    "an insert site between two core sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 is denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "all the gap symbols ignored at an insert site . in the following , the ( ordered ) sets of core and insert sites are denoted as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , and their union as @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , let us define a set of amino acid residues allowed for an insert site @xmath8 as @xmath12 ( 20 amino acid residue types ) , and that for a core site @xmath6 as @xmath13 ( 20 amino acid residues and deletion ) for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( deletion only ) for the terminal sites .    for one protein sequence in the msa , at most one residue may correspond to each core site @xmath6 whereas any number of residues may correspond to an insert site @xmath8 . in this sense , residues behave like fermions on core sites and like bosons on insert sites .",
    "the set of core and insert sites comprise a quasi - one - dimensional lattice structure as shown in figure [ fig : model ] . in this lattice structure ,",
    "two sites are connected if two consecutive residues in a protein sequence ( possibly including gap symbols ) can be assigned . if two sites are directly connected , they are defined to be a bonded or short - range pair .",
    "the self - connecting loop in each insert site indicates that it makes a bonded pair with itself .",
    "thus , an insertion may be indefinitely long , manifesting its boson - like character .    based on this lattice system , an alignment @xmath16 of a particular protein sequence @xmath17 in the msa may be represented as a sequence of length @xmath18 consisting of ordered pairs of a lattice site and a residue of @xmath19 : @xmath20 ( `` matchings '' to the terminal sites are also included ) . here , each @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "a whole msa consisting of @xmath24 sequences is a set of such aligned sequences : @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig : alignment ] shows some concrete examples of this representation of alignment .",
    "example of a multiple sequence alignment ( based on  @xcite ) .",
    "each row corresponds to a protein sequence ( s1,@xmath26 , s7 ) and each column to an alignment site . below the horizontal line ,",
    "each alignment site is annotated as to whether it corresponds to a core ( matching or deletion ) site ( `` o '' ) or an insert site ( `` i '' ) . indicated below these `` o''/ `` i '' symbols are the position of lattice sites .",

    "insert sites other than @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not explicit in this msa .",

    "for a given lattice model and its alignment @xmath16 with a protein sequence , the number of the residue type @xmath23 at the lattice site @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 this quantity is referred to as the single - site count .",
    "similarly , the number of a pair of residue types @xmath23 and @xmath55 on a bonded pair of lattice sites @xmath56 and @xmath57 occupied by two consecutive alignment sites is defined as @xmath58 which is referred to as the bonded pair count .",
    "the single - site counts and bonded pair counts are the two fundamental stochastic variables in the present theory . for later convenience ,",
    "let us define the non - bonded pair counts as @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "note that the non - bonded pair counts may be defined for residues residing on neighboring lattice sites as well as on the same ( @xmath61 ) site .",
    "the terms `` bonded '' and `` non - bonded '' here are meant to describe the connectivity along the polypeptide sequence rather than that along the lattice system ( a pair of residues in neighboring lattice sites may be either bonded or non - bonded depending on the given alignment ) . from these definitions , several relations follow .",
    "first , by the fermion - like character of the core site , we have for each @xmath62 @xmath63 between bonded pair counts and single - site count , we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "lastly , between non - bonded pair counts and single - site count , we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "i would like to statistically characterize the given msa in terms of the above quantities . to do so , suppose that the probability @xmath69 of an alignment @xmath16 is known for the lattice model .",
    "then , the expectation values of these numbers are defined as follows : @xmath70 which are referred to as single - site ( number ) densities , bonded pair ( number ) densities , and non - bonded pair ( number ) densities , respectively .",
    "these number densities naturally satisfy the relations analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rel1])-([eq : relnb2 ] ) .    to determine the form of @xmath69 , the principle of maximum entropy",

    "i compare the system including both the bonded and non - bonded interactions ( referred to as the `` @xmath209 '' system in the following ) with that including only the bonded interactions ( the `` @xmath88-only '' system ) .",
    "the calculations for the @xmath88-only system were performed by simply discarding the mean - field , which is justified due to the present definition of the mean - field ( eq . [ eq : mean - field ] ) .",
    "all the calculations in the following are based on the `` fixed - length '' solution , and the sequence length ( eq . [ eq : slen ] ) was constrained to that of the reference state .",
    "note that the present model does not exhibit phase transition due to the gaussian approximation of the non - bonded pair interactions .",
    "that is , the @xmath89 matrix is negative semi - definite so that there exists one and only one minimum for the non - bonded interactions ( i.e. , at the observed single - site densities ) .",
    "nevertheless , solving the self - consistent equation with varying temperatures helps to understand the behaviors of interactions . at high temperatures ,",
    "all the interactions are effectively weakened .",
    "this can be regarded as an idealization of uniform random mutations along the protein sequences of the given family . by observing the residue compositions perturbed by increased temperature",
    ", we can see which sites are more robust under the perturbations .",
    "the globin domains are found in a wide variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to higher eukaryotes .",
    "two of the most famous family members are myoglobins and hemoglobins both of which bind the heme prosthetic group .",
    "structurally , globins belong to the class of all-@xmath164 proteins , the lattice gas model of the globin domain consisted of 110 core sites ( excluding the termini ) and 111 insert sites .",
    "the self - consistent equation was solved for temperature ranging from @xmath210 to @xmath211 . above the latter temperature , the solution",
    "could not be obtained stably because the spectral radius of some @xmath116 exceeded 1 .    as the temperature increases , the free energy ( grand potential , eq .",
    "[ eq : free - energy ] ) increases up to around @xmath212 and then it starts to decrease ( figure [ fig : t - globin]a ) . decomposing the free energy ( eq . [ eq",
    ": f - decomp ] ) shows that both the internal energy ( figure [ fig : t - globin]b ) and entropy ( figure [ fig : t - globin]c ) increase with temperature . on the other hand , the gibbs energy ( eq . [ eq : gibbs - energy ] ) monotonically decreases with increasing temperature ( figure [ fig : t - globin]d ) , indicating that the sequence length tends to be longer for higher temperature",
    "this can be understood from the definition of the transfer matrix @xmath116 .",
    "since @xmath213 is required , @xmath214 holds for all @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) so the increased temperature potentially allows a larger number of residues to reside at insert sites . in order to fix the sequence length ,",
    "the chemical potential must be negative , and hence the negative gibbs energy .",
    "the behaviors of the @xmath209 and @xmath88-only systems appear similar regarding the free energy , internal energy , entropy and gibbs energy . to see the effect of non - bonded interactions more closely ,",
    "the internal energy was decomposed into bonded interactions and non - bonded interactions for the @xmath209 system ( figure [ fig : t - globin]e ) .",
    "it appears that the increase in non - bonded energy is more than an order of magnitude smaller ( figure [ fig : t - globin]e , blue line ) compared to that of bonded energy ( figure [ fig : t - globin]e , magenta line ) .",
    "furthermore , the divergence ( difference of residue distributions from the reference state ) shows a relatively large difference between the @xmath209 and @xmath88-only systems ( figure [ fig : t - globin]f ) .",
    "thus , the non - bonded interactions are very stable under increased temperatures , and they greatly stabilize the residue composition .",
    "a closer examination of each site ( at @xmath217 ) shows that the magnitude of the divergence of the @xmath88-only system is about three times as large as that of the @xmath209 system ( figure [ fig : t - globin - div ] ) .",
    "the broad peaks of the divergence roughly correspond to regions of @xmath164-helices .",
    "furthermore , with non - bonded interactions , finer peaks match the periodicity of the helices ( 3 to 4 residues ) whereas such periodicity is not observed with the @xmath88-only system .",
    "thus , non - bonded interactions seem not only to stabilize the residue composition , but to make the composition more specific to the structure of the domain .",
    "the v - set domains are found in many proteins the representative members of which are immunoglobulin variable domains .",
    "the lattice gas model of this domain consists of 114 core sites ( excluding the termini ) and 115 insert sites .",
    "structurally , they belong to the all-@xmath218 class having a @xmath218-sandwich structure .",
    "the same procedures were applied to the v - set domain as the globin domain . in this case , however , self - consistent solutions could be obtained only for temperatures @xmath219 .",
    "this may be due to a long insertion allowed at the insert site @xmath220 ( average length of 23.5 residues ) .",
    "other than this limitation , the results were found to be qualitatively similar to the case of globins ( figure [ fig : t - vset]a - d )",
    ". however , the free energy decrease is more pronounced for the @xmath209 system , compared to the case of the globin .",
    "again , while the increase in temperature hardly changes the non - bonded energy ( figure [ fig : t - vset]e ) , the difference of the total divergence between the @xmath209 and @xmath88-only systems is significant .",
    "a close examination of individual sites at @xmath217 also indicates that inclusion of non - bonded interactions greatly suppresses the divergence , and broad peaks roughly correspond to secondary structure elements ( in this case , @xmath218-strands ) . with the non - bonded interactions , finer peaks appear to match with the periodicity of @xmath218-strands ( 2 residues )",
    "therefore , the conclusion drawn for the globin domain applies also to the v - set domain .",
    "that is , the non - bonded interactions act to stabilize the residue composition as well as to make composition more specific to the structure of the domain .",
    "as opposed to global perturbations such as increased temperature , local perturbations helps us to examine the contribution of individual sites .",
    "local perturbations can be imposed by biasing the residue composition at a site of interest . in this subsection",
    ", the composition of a particular core site was biased in such a way that single - site density was set to 0.95 for alanine and to 0.0025 for all other residue types ( including the `` deletion '' residue type ) .",
    "this residue composition can be achieved by adjusting the chemical potential @xmath221 .",
    "when the site @xmath6 is constrained in this way , the corresponding equilibrium state is referred to as the `` a@xmath222 mutant '' in the following .              comparing the free energy difference between the @xmath209 and @xmath88-only systems",
    ", it is immediately noticed that the ranges of @xmath223 are very different between the two ; the former being an order of magnitude larger than the latter . while a large number of alanine mutants for both the @xmath209 and @xmath88-only systems ( 82 and 101 , respectively , out of 110 ) exhibit @xmath224 ( i.e. , favorable mutants ) , the former ( @xmath209 ) shows a larger number of unfavorable ( @xmath225 ) alanine mutants .",
    "apart from the absolute values , the two systems appear to be correlated except for the region from the site 40 to 50 where secondary structures are sparse ( c.f .",
    ", figure [ fig : t - globin - div ] ) .",
    "in addition , they seem to be negatively correlated with site entropy ( figure [ fig : a - globin - p]a ) : highly conserved sites tend to have high @xmath223 values ( correlation coefficients , cc , were -0.60 and -0.57 for the @xmath209 and @xmath88-only systems , respectively ) .",
    "thus , despite the great difference in magnitudes , the @xmath209 system and @xmath88-only system appear to be similar in terms of free energy difference . behind this apparent similarity , however , exist different mechanisms , as we shall see in the following .    while internal energy difference , @xmath226 , also shows a similar correlation as @xmath223 ( figure [ fig : a - globin]b ) , entropy difference exhibits different , somewhat opposite , trends ( figure [ fig : a - globin]c ) .",
    "in fact , the relations between the internal energy and entropy are completely different between the @xmath209 and @xmath88-only systems ( figure [ fig : a - globin - p]b ) . while @xmath226 and @xmath227 are linearly and positively correlated ( cc = 0.99 ) for the @xmath88-only system , they relation is more complicated for the @xmath209 system : a positive correlation for @xmath228 ( cc=0.65 ) and a negative correlation for @xmath229 ( cc=-0.69 ) .",
    "the region @xmath228 corresponds to that spanned by the @xmath88-only system , and therefore is considered to be the region where local ( bonded ) interactions are dominant in @xmath226 .",
    "this in turn indicates that a large increase in nonlocal ( non - bonded ) interactions greatly restricts the residue composition throughout the globin domain .",
    "in fact , unlike the case for temperature scanning ( figure [ fig : t - globin ] ) , the perturbation by a point mutation induces a large increase in non - bonded energy that is comparable with that of bonded energy in the @xmath209 system ( figure [ fig : a - globin]e ) .",
    "the gibbs energy difference , @xmath230 , reveals a sharp contrast between the two systems ( figures [ fig : a - globin]d and [ fig : a - globin - p]c ) .",
    "the gibbs energy differences of the @xmath209 system are clustered below @xmath231 , but has a long tail towards higher values ( skewness was 1.1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "those for the @xmath88-only system are more or less symmetrically distributed around @xmath232 ( skewness was -1.4 ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath230 and site entropy is evident for the @xmath209 system ( cc = -0.71 ) , but is nearly absent for the @xmath88-only system ( cc = -0.18 ) ( figure [ fig : a - globin - p]c ) .",
    "the total divergence shows a trend similar to the gibbs energy difference in that its values are clustered at lower values and has a long tail towards higher values for the @xmath209 system , and that such is not the case for the @xmath88-only system ( figure [ fig : a - globin]f ) .",
    "although in the both systems the total divergence is well correlated with site entropy , the correlation is higher for the @xmath209 system ( cc = -0.78 ) than for the @xmath88-only system ( cc= -0.71 ) ( figure [ fig : a - globin - p]d ) . in the @xmath88-only system ,",
    "each mutation perturbs the residue compositions only locally around the mutated site , whereas in the @xmath209 system , a mutation at one site perturbs many sites across the the entire domain . as a result",
    ", the contrast between the effects of mutations at highly conserved sites and less conserved sites is higher for the @xmath209 system than for the @xmath88-only system .    in the globin domain ,",
    "the two most highly conserved residues are phenylalanine ( phe ) at site 38 ( @xmath233 ) and histidine ( his ) at site 91 ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "the alanine mutants at these sites show large differences in @xmath235 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a - globin - p]a ) , @xmath226 ( the two points with the largest @xmath226 in fig .",
    "[ fig : a - globin - p]b ) and @xmath230 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a - globin - p]c ) . according to a detailed study by ota et al .",
    "@xcite , these two residue are conserved for different reasons : phe at site 38 ( `` cd1 '' in @xcite ) is conserved for structural stability whereas his at site 91 ( `` f8 '' ) is conserved for the heme - binding function at the cost of structural stability . while it is reasonable to observe that the @xmath236 mutant of the structurally conserved phe significantly disturbs the system , the present result suggests that the @xmath237 mutant of the functionally conserved his is also maintained by a significant amount of interactions with other sites .",
    "this may indicate the importance of structural scaffold to maintain protein function .",
    "the case for the v - set domain is mostly similar to that for the globin domain ( figures [ fig : a - vset ] and [ fig : a - vset - p ] ) .",
    "however , there are some marked differences to be noted .",
    "first , the free energy differences @xmath223 due to alanine mutations take both positive and negative values for the @xmath209 system , but only negative values for the @xmath88-only system .",
    "the positive values for the former corresponds to relatively well - conserved sites , as can be seen in figure [ fig : a - vset - p]a .",
    "in fact , the correlation between @xmath223 and site entropy is significantly higher for the @xmath209 system ( cc = -0.72 ) than for the @xmath88-only system ( cc = -0.52 ) .",
    "second , while the correlation between internal energy and entropy differences is linear and positive for the @xmath88-only system ( cc = 0.96 ) as was the case with the globin , that for the @xmath209 system of the v - set domain shows only a negative trend for the entire range of @xmath226 ( cc = -0.92 ) .",
    "third , the contrast of the gibbs energy difference is far more pronounced ( figure [ fig : a - vset]d , the skewness was 1.8 for @xmath209 and -0.37 for @xmath88-only ) and its correlation with site entropy is very high for the @xmath209 system ( cc = -0.80 ) whereas it is negligible for the @xmath88-only system ( cc = -0.08 ) ( figure [ fig : a - vset - p]c ) .",
    "similarly , as for total divergence , the @xmath209 system shows sharper contrast ( figure [ fig : a - vset]f ) and higher correlation with site entropy ( cc = -0.80 , figure [ fig : a - vset - p]d ) than the @xmath88-only system ( cc = -0.67 ) .",
    "thus , compared to the case with the globin , the differences between the @xmath209 and @xmath88-only systems are more pronounced .",
    "this may be due to the difference in the structures of these domains .",
    "the globin domain has an all-@xmath164 fold in which local interactions in @xmath164-helices are prominent , whereas the v - set domain has an all-@xmath218 fold in which nonlocal interactions between @xmath218-strands are prominent .",
    "this difference may be reflected in the non - bonded interactions of the lattice gas model , hence the pronounced difference between the @xmath209 and @xmath88-only systems .          to confirm the observations made above , alanine scanning",
    "was performed for 17 pfam families that are the largest in the number of family members and are of model length of less than 300 sites .",
    "the free energy difference , @xmath238 , tends to have more positive values for the @xmath209 system than for the @xmath88-only system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : top17a ] , cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : a - globin]a and [ fig : a - vset]c ) .",
    "the skewness ( i.e. , the standardized third moment ) of @xmath239 consistently have positive values for the @xmath209 system whereas it can be either positive or negative for the @xmath88-only system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : top17]b ) .",
    "the negative correlation between site entropy and @xmath239 was also clear for the @xmath209 system whereas such was not the case for the @xmath88-only system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : top17]c ) .",
    "thus , the trend that the non - bonded interaction enhances correlation with sequence conservation seem to hold generally .",
    "one of the fundamental assumptions of the present lattice gas model is that alignment sites can be classified into core sites and insert sites .",
    "although this classification may be ambiguous to some extent , once the classification is made , the lattice structure is uniquely determined . while the lattice structure reflects the chemical structure of polypeptide chains , interactions between the lattice sites are not limited to those that are local along the chain",
    ". the principle of maximum entropy allows the model to treat bonded ( local ) and non - bonded ( nonlocal ) interactions in a coherent manner . in comparison , the profile hmm  @xcite shares a similar lattice structure as the lattice gas model , but it can not treat nonlocal interactions due to its assumption of the markov process along the lattice structure . on the other hand , the direct - coupling analysis ( as applied to contact prediction )  @xcite , which casts a msa as a potts model  @xcite , simply ignores insert sites so that it can not faithfully represent polypeptide chains .",
    "threading methods  @xcite or conditional random field models  @xcite can combine the polypeptide structure with nonlocal interactions , but such integration is often _",
    "ad hoc _ because there are no well - defined rules or principles for determining the relative contributions of various interactions .",
    "it is possible to treat a msa without classifying its columns into cores and inserts if one ignores the possibility of adding new sequences in the future .",
    "in fact , this approach is adopted by the gremlin method by balakrishnan et al .  @xcite that is based on the markov random fields ( the present lattice gas model also belongs to this class of statistical models ) . in practice , however , they discarded columns with excessive gaps .",
    "such a preprocessing seems to be required because alignments within an insertion are often meaningless .",
    "this does not necessarily mean , however , that the existence of the insertion is meaningless . in any case , discarding columns of a msa will lose the information about the linear chain structure of protein sequences as well as the possibility of adding new sequences without changing the core structure of the msa .",
    "the present lattice gas model resolves the shortcomings of these previous models as both bonded and non - bonded interactions as well as insertions naturally emerge from a single framework .",
    "the main tricks here are the classification of core and insert sites and the use of residue counts , @xmath240 and @xmath241 , as fundamental variables rather than the raw alignment sequences ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "these are especially important for treating insert sites where any number of residues are allowed to exist .",
    "the lattice gas model can compute the probability of an entire alignment , and what has been conventionally regarded as the probability of residue occurrence at sites should be regarded as the expected number of residues at the sites .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the present formulation of the lattice gas model offers an interesting perspective regarding the interplay between local and nonlocal interactions . as can be seen from the relations eqs .",
    "( [ eq : relb1])([eq : relnb2 ] ) , or more precisely , from the analogous relations that hold for the number densities , local and nonlocal interactions are not independent of each other , but are related via single - site densities . in this sense",
    ", local and nonlocal interactions must be consistent with each other  @xcite , and the consistency is inherently embedded in a ( well - curated ) msa . in the conventional formulation of the direct - coupling analysis , only the relations corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : relnb1 ] ) and ( [ eq : relnb2 ] ) are present because the chain structure is absent .",
    "since the parameters conjugate to the single - site densities are external fields ( chemical potentials in the present case ) which are not intrinsic to the system , the relations eqs .",
    "( [ eq : relnb1 ] ) and ( [ eq : relnb2 ] ) alone do not address the consistency between local and nonlocal interactions .    in this study ,",
    "i have adopted the gaussian approximation for the non - bonded coupling parameters ( eq . [ eq : k ] ) as well as the mean - field approximation ( eq . [ eq : mean - field ] ) for computing the partition function .",
    "this approach has its advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the advantages are that the parameters are readily obtained and that the partition function can be computed analytically and efficiently .",
    "these enable us to study the system under various perturbations relatively easily .",
    "a major disadvantage is that it is not possible to determine the @xmath89 matrix self - consistently .",
    "i therefore resorted to the gaussian approximation by implicitly assuming that each site is independent of other sites , which is not fully consistent with the lattice structure of the system .",
    "the reason for this inconsistency is likely to be that the assumption for the mean - field approximation ( i.e. , non - bonded interactions are relatively weak ; see references@xcite ) does not actually hold in the present case .",
    "due to this approximation , the system does not exhibit a phase transition that might be induced by increased temperatures or by mutations at potentially important sites .",
    "in addition , the gaussian approximation required that the diagonal blocks of the @xmath89 matrix , @xmath242 , be used as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) , otherwise the reference state was found to be unstable .",
    "the diagonal blocks represent self - interactions , and hence , are purely site - specific quantities . in this sense , they obscure the mechanism by which the interactions of each site with other sites induce the residue composition of that site . overcoming these problems would require the direct maximization of the lagrangian ( eq . [ eq : lagrangian ] ) with respect to the parameters @xmath78 without diagonal ( and bonded pair ) blocks .",
    "it is also possible to apply other approximate methods such as pseudo - likelihood maximization  @xcite .    despite these limitations in the treatment of non - bonded interactions",
    ", the present results already provided some interesting observations regarding the role of non - bonded interactions .",
    "an increased temperature exerts a global and unbiased perturbation on the system . in this case",
    ", it was found that non - bonded energy did not significantly change compared to the bonded energy ( figures [ fig : t - globin]e and [ fig : t - vset]e ) .",
    "this implies that the residue compositions at each site adapt to the perturbation in a cooperative manner so that they stay stable .",
    "this in turn suggests , at least within the limitation of the approximations , that a protein family can accommodate a diverse variety of amino acid sequences as far as the pattern of correlations between sites is conserved .",
    "on the other hand , the virtual alanine scanning revealed a more conspicuous effect of non - bonded interactions .",
    "alanine mutations at well - conserved sites disturbed the system to a greater extent as measured by free energy , gibbs energy and total divergence ( figures [ fig : a - globin - p ] and [ fig : a - vset - p ] ) , and the relation between internal energy and entropy changes was completely different from those of @xmath88-only systems .",
    "in particular , the observation that many or most of the free energy changes were negative for the @xmath88-only system ( figures [ fig : a - globin]a and [ fig : a - vset]a ) suggests that residue conservation can not be explained without considering nonlocal ( non - bonded ) effects .    the interactions in the lattice gas model",
    "originate solely from the statistics of a msa .",
    "they are therefore not directly related to physical interactions .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that the @xmath89 matrix as used in this study is a good predictor of physical contacts in native protein structures  @xcite . to further confirm this",
    ", the present results showed that the effect of non - bonded ( statistical ) interactions was more pronounced in the v - set domain ( an all-@xmath218 fold , involving more nonlocal physical interactions ) than in the globin domain ( an all-@xmath164 fold , involving less nonlocal interactions ) . in addition , the @xmath88-only system showed relatively better correlations with conservation for the globin than for the v - set domain , indicating that the bonded interactions also reflect physical local interactions to some extent .",
    "this point is also supported by the correlation , albeit weak , between divergence and secondary structures ( figures [ fig : t - globin - div ] and [ fig : t - vset - div ] ) .",
    "thus , the lattice gas model provides a means to connect the information in amino acid sequence with the underlying three - dimensional structure of the domain .",
    "this connection can not be addressed directly in conventional sequence analysis methods such as the profile hmm .",
    "in fact , the very existence of long - range correlations indicates that msa s can not be modeled as a purely one - dimensional system where long - range correlations simply can not exist  @xcite .",
    "considering this fact , it is surprising that conventional multiple sequence alignment methods , inherently based on the one - dimensional system , can produce msa s with long - range correlations .",
    "this may be a manifestation of the consistency principle indicated above  @xcite .",
    "there are a few possible extensions and applications of the present lattice gas model . in the present form ,",
    "the model is autonomous in the sense that it does not require an input or target sequence for computing various statistical quantities ( once the observed statistical quantities are obtained ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is readily possible to align the model with a particular amino acid sequence to compute a partition function and therefore other quantities conditioned on that input sequence . in this way",
    ", the lattice gas model may be used for detecting remote homologs .",
    "the present results ( e.g. , figures [ fig : t - globin - div ] and [ fig : t - vset - div ] ) suggest that inclusion of non - bonded interactions would increase the specificity of the alignment . furthermore",
    ", the model can be aligned with a `` sequence '' of a given length with unspecified amino acid residues to compute the partition function that is conditioned on all the amino acid sequences of that length . in this way , one can enumerate those sequences that are compatible with the model . in other words ,",

    "such applications may be pursued in the future to open new possibilities in protein sequence analysis .",
