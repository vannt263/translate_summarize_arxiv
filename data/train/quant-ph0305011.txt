    "quantum phase - space distribution functions @xcite offer an alternative means of formulating quantum mechanics to the standard wave mechanics formulation .",
    "some of the properties that these functions possess , however , make it difficult to associate them with a direct probabilistic interpretation .",
    "the wigner distribution function @xcite , for example , can take on negative values , while the husimi distribution function @xcite , although nonnegative , does not yield the correct marginal distributions .",
    "these functions are therefore usually regarded as a mathematical tool used to describe the quantum behavior of the system being considered and are thus referred to as the quasiprobability distribution functions .",
    "+ there , however , have been continued theoretical investigations @xcite on the possibility of the physical significance of the husimi distribution function and more generally of the nonnegative smoothed wigner distribution function , ever since arthurs and kelly @xcite showed that the husimi distribution is a proper probability distribution associated with a particular model of simultaneous measurements of position and momentum .",
    "an operational definition of a probability distribution can be given @xcite that explicitly takes into account the action of the measurement device modeled as a  filter \" .",
    "the analysis shows that the phase - space distribution connected to a realistic simultaneous measurement of position and momentum can be expressed as a convolution of the wigner function of the system being detected and the wigner function of the filter state .",
    "if the wigner function of the filter state is given by a minimum uncertainty gaussian function , which is the case for an ideal simultaneous measurement with the maximal accuracy allowed by the heisenberg uncertainty principle , the distribution can be identified as the husimi distribution .",
    "a generalization to the case of a measurement with less accuracy leads immediately to an identification of the nonnegative smoothed wigner distribution as a distribution connected to a realistic measurement .",
    "+ it is then clear that , in the phase - space approach , the act of a measurement is conveniently modeled by gaussian smoothing , with the widths of the smoothing function identified as measurement errors .",
    "the phase - space approach based on the smoothed wigner distribution function thus provides a convenient framework in which to study any changes that occur in the phase - space distribution of a system as a result of a measurement .",
    "+ in this paper we aim to investigate effects of a measurement on the phase - space distribution of a system using the phase - space description based on the smoothed wigner distribution function @xcite .",
    "we consider some simple one - dimensional systems  a particle in a square - well potential ,",
    "a particle moving under the influence of a step potential , and a one - dimensional model atom irradiated by high - power laser pulses emitting high - harmonic radiation  and compute their wigner and smoothed wigner distribution functions .",
    "the pure quantum distribution of the systems unaffected by a measurement is represented by contour curves of the wigner distribution functions , whereas the  coarse - grained \" distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ , the distribution  contaminated \" by a measurement is displayed by contour curves of the smoothed wigner distribution functions .",
    "it may be expected that delicate quantum features are obscured more strongly by a measurement with larger measurement errors .",
    "such effects of a measurement , which may be referred to as measurement - induced decoherence , can be studied by observing changes in the contour curves of the smoothed wigner distribution functions , as the widths of the smoothing gaussian function are increased .",
    "we also compare the contour curves of the smoothed wigner distributions we computed with the corresponding contour curves resulting from the classical analysis .",
    "this should yield information on what quantum features survive measurement - induced decoherence .",
    "+ in section [ wsw ] we briefly describe the wigner and smoothed wigner distribution functions and discuss their physical significance in relation to a measurement . in section",
    "[ ods ] we choose , as our examples of simple dynamical systems , a particle in an infinite square - well potential and a particle subjected to a step potential and compute their contour curves of the wigner and smoothed wigner distribution functions .",
    "these contour curves form the basis of our discussion of measurement - induced decoherence .",
    "another example we take for our study is a one - dimensional model atom irradiated by high - power laser pulses , which is described in section [ hhg ] .",
    "the time - frequency wigner and smoothed wigner distributions are computed for high - harmonic radiation emitted from the model atom , and the effect of a measurement on the time - frequency distribution is discussed .",
    "finally a discussion is given in section [ dis ] .",
    "the wigner distribution function @xcite is defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the coordinate and the momentum of the system being considered and @xmath3 is the wave function . in our study of one - dimensional dynamical systems , we restrict our attention to the simple case when the system is in its energy eigenstate . the wave function @xmath3 and",
    "the wigner distribution function @xmath4 is then independent of time . the gaussian - smoothed wigner distribution function @xcite is given by @xmath5 when the smoothing gaussian function is a minimum uncertainty wave packet , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath6 , @xmath7 can be identified as the husimi distribution function , @xmath8 where the parameter @xmath9 defined as @xmath10 has the dimension of @xmath11 . if @xmath7 is to represent a probability distribution corresponding to a simultaneous measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the widths should satisfy the inequality @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , can be identified as measurement errors in @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the detection apparatus . for general mathematical treatments , however , one may also include the unphysical regime @xmath15 in the analysis .",
    "in particular , in the limit @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 approaches the wigner function @xmath19 .",
    "+ in general the wigner function can be defined in space of any pair of conjugate variables . in particular , in studies of signal processing , the wigner function in the time - frequency space , @xmath20 , plays an important role @xcite .",
    "the main tool for our time - frequency analysis of high - harmonic radiation generated by an atom irradiated by laser pulses , which is described in section [ hhg ] , is the wigner time - frequency distribution function of the dipole acceleration @xmath21 where the dipole acceleration @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ da ] ) , @xmath24 represents the wave function of the electron in the atom and @xmath25 is the position of the electron .",
    "the gaussian - smoothed wigner distribution function in time - frequency space is given by @xmath26 when the widths @xmath27 and @xmath28 satisfy @xmath29 , @xmath7 becomes the husimi time - frequency distribution function @xmath30 where the parameter @xmath9 given by @xmath31 has now the dimension of @xmath32 .",
    "+ since the measurement errors satisfying the inequality @xmath12 ( or @xmath33 ) belong to the physical regime , the contour curves of @xmath7 associated with the smoothing gaussian function satisfying this inequality can in principle be observed .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward way of constructing such contour curves from measurements is to make a large number of simultaneous measurements of position and momentum ( or time and frequency ) upon identically prepared systems .",
    "each measurement should be performed with the same measurement errors @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( or @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "each measurement should also be performed on a given system no more than once , because the measurement disturbs the system and its phase - space distribution . from the results of such measurements",
    "one can determine the phase - space distribution ( or the time - frequency distribution ) for the system under consideration .",
    "the contour curves of the smoothed wigner distribution function associated with the widths @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( or @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) of the smoothing gaussian function are then obtained by connecting the phase - space points ( or the time - frequency points ) having the same phase - space probability ( or the same time - frequency space probability ) .",
    "+ our main concern here is the effects of a measurement on quantum properties of a system .",
    "information on such effects can be directly obtained by comparing contour curves of the wigner distribution function and those of various smoothed wigner distribution functions associated with different values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( or @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) . in the next two sections we present results for our computation of the contour curves in phase space for two simple one - dimensional dynamical systems and in time - frequency space for high - harmonic radiation emitted by an atom irradiated by laser pulses .",
    "in this section we present results of our computation of contour curves of the wigner and smoothed wigner distribution functions for two simple systems in a stationary state ; a particle in a symmetric infinite square - well potential and a particle moving under the influence of a step potential . for stationary systems",
    "it is possible to obtain contour plots of the wigner distribution function directly by solving a pair of time - independent equations of motion satisfied by the wigner function @xcite .",
    "one can also derive a pair of time - independent equations of motion for the smoothed wigner distribution function and can thus obtain its contour plots from the solutions of these equations . in the present work , however , we have chosen to numerically integrate the wigner distribution function according to eq .",
    "( [ gsw ] ) in order to obtain contour curves of the smoothed wigner distribution function , because an analytical form for the wigner distribution function is known for each of the two systems being considered here .",
    "we consider a particle in a symmetric infinite square - well potential @xmath34 an analytic form for the wigner distribution function is known for this system in its eigenstate @xcite . for all our computation",
    "we take the mass of the particle to be 1 and the width of the well to be 20 in an arbitrary unit system in which @xmath35 . + shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) are contour plots of the wigner distribution function and the smoothed wigner distribution function , respectively , for the particle in its ground state .",
    "the smoothing parameters for fig . [ fig1](b ) are chosen to be @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) . comparing figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) , we see that the smoothed wigner distribution function has a simpler structure than the nonsmoothed wigner distribution function .",
    "this reflects the effect of measurement - induced decoherence . the most conspicuous quantum structure which is exhibited in fig . [ fig1](a ) but is not revealed when observed with @xmath36 and @xmath39 is closed orbits off the origin called  islands \" .",
    "two pairs of the islands are shown in fig . [ fig1](a ) .",
    "close inspection of the contour plot of the wigner distribution function , however , reveals many such islands , although not shown in the figure .",
    "we note that a purely classical dynamical consideration would indicate that the contour lines of the classical probability follow classical trajectories .",
    "thus , for the present case of a particle in a square - well potential , classical contour lines would consist of a set of pairs of straight horizontal lines in the region @xmath40 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the contour curves of the smoothed wigner function , fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , are not straight lines , which indicate that some quantum characteristics still survive gaussian smoothing . the quantum dynamical property represented by curved contour curves may be referred to as nonlocality , because these curves lead one to interpret that the particle changes its momentum even before it actually hits the potential wall .",
    "( for classical dynamical interpretation of wigner contour curves and problems arising from it , see @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "this quantum behavior ( curved contour curves ) lies within the limits of observation because fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) belongs to the physical regime ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "[ fig2](a)-[fig2](d ) show contour curves for the same particle in its fifth eigenstate @xcite . the contour plot of the wigner distribution function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) indicates that there are five maxima along the @xmath1 axis arising from the five - peak standing wave structure of the eigenfunction and two maxima along the @xmath2 axis corresponding to the momenta to the right and left , respectively , of the classical particle of the same energy .",
    "characteristic quantum features such as curved contour lines and the formation of islands are even more evident here",
    ". figs . [ fig2](b ) and [ fig2](c ) are contour plots of the husimi distribution function ( @xmath42 ) with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "one sees that a choice of a large @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) results in strong smoothing along the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) axis .",
    "these two figures represent the quantum phase - space distribution connected to ideal simultaneous measurements with different degrees of the position _ vs_. momentum uncertainties .",
    "the fact that husimi curves are different for a different choice of @xmath13 or @xmath47 means physically that the quantum distribution looks different depending on how one observes it .",
    "it should be noted that the curves of figs . [ fig2](b ) and [ fig2](c ) , although simpler in structure than the curves of fig . [ fig2](a ) due to measurement - induced decoherence , still exhibit strong quantum behavior such as the islands even though they belong to the physical regime .",
    "this can be understood if we note that the uncertainties @xmath48 and @xmath49 associated with the fifth eigenstate are given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the widths @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the smoothing gaussian function used for figs . [ fig2](b ) and [ fig2](c ) are less than the uncertainties @xmath53 and @xmath54 inherent in the fifth eigenstate , and therefore the probabilistic nature of the quantum eigenstate is expected to be displayed by the corresponding contour curves .",
    "[ fig2](d ) shows contour plots for the case @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "one sees now that the islands , a clear indication of a strong quantum feature , have disappeared .",
    "note , however , that the nonlocal nature ( _ i.e. _ , curved contour curves ) is still indicated by the contour curves of fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , as these curves deviate from the corresponding classical trajectories , _ i.e. _ , straight horizontal lines .      as a second example we consider a particle of fixed energy @xmath57 moving under the influence of a step potential @xmath58 the wave function and the wigner distribution function for this particle",

    "[ fig3](a ) shows a contour plot of the wigner distribution function for the particle .",
    "in addition to the quantum features such as curved contour lines and the islands that are already exhibited by the wigner curves of the particle in a square - well potential , we see that some curves exhibit tunneling into the potential step .",

    "strong quantum features such as nonlocality , islands and tunneling are still clearly shown , although the curves belong to the physical regime .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that , for the particle of energy @xmath61 being considered here , @xmath69 ( since the particle is extended in the entire half space @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 , and the widths @xmath13 and @xmath14 chosen for figs .",

    "a typical emission spectrum observed experimentally shows a broad plateau extending to high - order harmonics accompanied with a fast cutoff .",
    "the mechanism by which high - order harmonics are generated is now well understood .",
