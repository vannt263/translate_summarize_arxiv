    "the qcd phase transition manifests itself in two phenomena , deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the conventional order parameter for ( de)confinement is the polyakov loop , the straight loop in the time direction . after a suitable renormalization , it is related to the free energy of a static quark via @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the polyakov loop is small in the confined phase ( and exactly vanishes in the quenched case because of center symmetry ) and increases above the critical temperature .",
    "the chiral condensate , on the other hand , is an order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking in the massless limit , as it is not invariant under chiral transformations . in the chirally broken phase ,",
    "the chiral condensate is finite , while it decays above the restoration temperature .",
    "lattice simulations at physical quark masses have revealed the qcd phase transition to be a crossover with pseudo - critical temperatures of @xmath3mev for the chiral susceptibility and @xmath4mev for the polyakov loop in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the dual condensate @xcite connects polyakov loop and chiral condensate as two different mass limits , thus it also relates confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it is therefore particularly interesting to see what one can learn from the dual condensate about the physical crossover .",
    "we here improve previous results @xcite and study the dual condensate on the @xmath5 staggered dynamical configurations of @xcite .",
    "the physical boundary condition for a fermion field at finite temperature is anti - periodic : @xmath6 . with ` quark condensate '",
    "we refer to the expectation value @xmath7 \\rangle$ ] with this boundary condition .",
    "we here also consider general boundary conditions @xcite @xmath8 giving the general quark condensate @xmath9 \\rangle       = \\frac{1}{v } \\sum_{\\lambda_\\varphi } \\frac{1}{m \\pm i \\lambda_\\varphi}\\ , ,         \\label{eqn : cond }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 are the eigenvalues of the massless dirac operator with these boundary condition ( the physical boundary condition @xmath11 is among them ) .",

    "the green lines have winding number one . ]",
    "the dual condensate is defined as the first fourier component of the general quark condensate with respect to the boundary phase @xmath12 : @xmath13    the interpretation of this quantity is simplest in a lattice context .",
    "one can implement the boundary conditions ( [ eqn : bc ] ) by multiplying a factor @xmath14 to temporal links in one , say the last , time slice @xmath15    the general quark condensate @xmath16 is gauge invariant and as such is composed of the contributions from all kinds of closed loops .",
    "these loops receive different powers of @xmath14 factors , see fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsindphi ] . now the dual condensate as the first fourier component of @xmath16 ( see ( [ eqn : dualcond ] ) ) , picks out the contributions from all the loops with one @xmath14 factor .",
    "these are loops winding once in the temperal direction , hence the dual condensate can be viewed as a ` dressed polyakov loop ' .    0.2 cm ( top ) and the dual condensate @xmath17 ( bottom ) , both in gev@xmath18 , at @xmath19mev and @xmath20mev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    -0.1@xmath21[mev]0.1 cm     ( top ) and the dual condensate @xmath17 ( bottom ) , both in gev@xmath18 , at @xmath19mev and @xmath20mev . ]",
    "-0.1@xmath21[mev ]    in a similar way dual observables can be constructed for arbitrary gauge invariant objects ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    the conventional infinitely thin polyakov loop is included in the set of loops that wind once and dominates in the limit of large probe mass @xmath22 ( which can be seen through an expansion in @xmath23 ) . in this limit , however , more uv eigenvalues contribute to the sum in ( [ eqn : dualcond ] ) @xcite .",
    "we here consider all quantities unrenormalized ( in @xcite we demonstrated that the ( quenched ) dressed polyakov loop has only a mild dependence on the lattice spacing ) .",
    "we use dynamical improved staggered fermion configurations from @xcite on lattices of size @xmath24 , for temperatures ranging from @xmath25mev to @xmath26mev and lattice spacings from @xmath27fm to @xmath28fm .",

    "we currently have completed the spectrum calculations for 20 to 35 configurations at temperatures between @xmath31mev and @xmath32mev .",
    "the first problem we investigate is the convergence of the sums ( [ eqn : cond ] ) and ( [ eqn : dualcond ] ) when truncated to the number of available eigenvalues ( in physical units ) .",
    "as the contribution of a @xmath35 pair to the condensates is @xmath36 , it is clear that this contribution decays for @xmath37 and only the lowest part of the spectrum contributes .    for the dual condensate",
    "there is an additional effect because it only probes the difference in the response of the spectra to changing boundary conditions .",
    "a strong response is manifest only in the ir spectrum @xcite , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : diracoperatorspectrum ] , and for dual condensates thus only the ir contributes . fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] illustrates this effect : when using the available spectrum , the physical chiral condensate from ( [ eqn : cond ] ) has not converged , while the dual condensate has due to the additional fourier transform in ( [ eqn : dualcond ] ) .",

    "it is flat at low temperature and depends strongly on @xmath12 for high temperatures .",
    "similar results were found also in non - lattice approaches @xcite .     in @xmath38 as a function of temperature and boundary angle with @xmath39mev ( top ) .",

    "it should serve as an order parameter for deconfinement , as the polyakov loop does . in the quenched case this statement",
    "can be made exact because of the same behavior under center transformations @xcite . here",
    "both quantities have at least the same qualitative behavior .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dualcondensate ] we show our results for the absolute value of the unrenormalized dual condensate as a function of temperature , compared to the conventional polyakov loop .",

    "all of these quantities show an order parameter behavior in the temperature range of @xmath49 to @xmath32mev . in the future we want to identify the critical temperatures ( through inflection points and susceptibilities ) and study their mass dependence .",
