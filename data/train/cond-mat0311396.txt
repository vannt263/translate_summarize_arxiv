    "the dynamics of a probe will depend on the local state of the background liquid .",
    "when and where there is no mobility , the diffusive motion of the probe will be hindered . when and where there is mobility , the probe molecule will undergo diffusion easily . as such , in a coarse  grained picture",
    ", the probe molecule is allowed to jump from lattice site @xmath16 to a nearest neighbor site when site @xmath16 coincides with a mobile region , @xmath15 . in order to satisfy detailed balance",
    ", we further assume that the probe molecule can move only to a mobile region , i.e. , x(t+t ) = x(t ) x n_x n_xx , where @xmath28 denotes the position of the probe at time @xmath29 .",
    "units of time and length scales are set equal to a monte carlo sweep and a lattice spacing , respectively .",

    "the probe molecule executes diffusive motion , without being trapped in immobile regions for any significant period of time .",
    "the low temperature dynamics is different .",
    "mobility is sparse , defects tend to be spatially isolated at a given time , and trajectory space exhibits space  time patterns .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "because of the facilitation constraint , an immobile region needs a nearest mobile region to become mobile at a later time .",

    "an immobile region can become mobile after a period of time . at that stage",

    ", the mean square displacement reaches its diffusive linear regime after a very short transient time . in the low temperature case , the probe molecule in the east model case reaches the diffusive regime after a longer time and over a larger length scale than that in the fa model with the same reduced temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] plots the diffusion coefficient of a probe molecule for the fa and the east models .",

    "error estimates for our simulations are no larger than the size of the symbols .    in the fa model ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient exhibits arrhenius behavior for @xmath37 .",
    "this behavior reflects the fact that relaxation dynamics in the fa model is similar to that of a strong liquid . in this regime , over more than 4 orders of magnitude in @xmath1 , the slope of @xmath38 vs",

    "this result is consistent with the expected low temperature scaling ,",
    "d_fa ~c^2 ~(-2/ ) , [ dfa ] as discussed in the next subsection . in the east model case , also pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the diffusion coefficient decreases more quickly than arrhenius .",
    "this super  arrhenius behavior is due to the hierarchical nature of dynamics in the east model @xcite .",
    "comparing the diffusion coefficients with the relaxation times of the background liquids demonstrates stokes ",
    "einstein violation in both models .",
    "the relaxation times , @xmath2 , of the fa and the east models at different temperatures have been determined in prior work @xcite . when the stokes ",

    "this behavior occurs in the fa and east models when @xmath41 , but fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that @xmath42 is enhanced from that behavior by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude when @xmath43 .",
    "bear in mind , these deviations from stokes ",
    "einstein are @xmath5 results",
    ". the appropriate generalization of the fa model to @xmath7 does not exhibit such large deviations . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that generalizations of the east model , which is hierarchical and therefore fragile , will have weak dimensional dependence and continue to exhibit large deviations for @xmath7 .",
    "we turn to the arguments that explain these claims now .      for high temperatures , the local mobility field will tend to be close to its mean value , @xmath34 .",
    "as such , both the relaxation mechanism of the material and the diffusional motion of the probe molecule make use of the same local mobility fields . for this reason , the diffusion coefficient and the relaxation time scale",
    "are strongly coupled in this regime , leading to the stokes ",
    "einstein relation .    at low temperatures , however ,",
    "the dynamics of the system is not so simply related to the mean mobility field . here , the fluctuations of bubble structures dominate .",
    "the relaxation time of the background liquid will approximately scale as the longest temporal extension of bubbles .",
    "the _ persistence time _ of an individual lattice site , @xmath44 , is the time for which that site makes its first change in state .",
    "its typical size will be intimately tied to the structural relaxation time of the liquid . for the fa model in @xmath5 , ~t_pers ~c^-3 .",
    "[ taufa ] see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with a simple argument concerning diffusive motions of excitation lines in the low temperature fa model @xcite . in particular , the structural relaxation times in the fa model is given by the time in which a typical bubble structure looses its identity through wandering motions of excitation lines .",
    "the excitation line has a local diffusivity of @xmath45 .",
    "( we use caligraphic @xmath46 to distinguish this diffusion constant for excitations from that for particles , @xmath1 . ) in order to form a bubble , an excitation line needs to wander distance of the order of the typical length between defects , @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the mean relaxation time is given by @xmath48 .",
    "when the probe molecule is at the boundary of a bubble , it may not need to wait until the bubble closes in order to undergo diffusion ; rather , it can remain within mobile cells and diffuse around the boundary of the bubbles . in this way",
    ", translational diffusion will be more facilitated than structural relaxation , leading to an enhanced diffusion in the fluctuation dominated low temperature region .",
    "specifically , consider the dynamical _ exchange times _ , i.e. , the times between flipping events for a given lattice site .",
    "see fig .",
    "@xmath49 is such a time duration for an @xmath17 state and @xmath50 is such a time duration for an @xmath51 state .",
    "the probe molecule can move only while in a mobile region .",
    "further , the mean square displacement of the probe will be proportional to the number of diffusive steps that a probe molecule will take during the trajectory , @xmath52 , ^2~ ~tt_0 + t_1 .",
    "[ msqd - fa ] here , @xmath53 is the length of a long trajectory in the fa model .",
    "the average duration of the defect state , @xmath54 , is inversely proportional to the probability of a lattice site being mobile , @xmath34 , times the flip rate , @xmath23 . since @xmath55",
    ", we have , t_1 ~c^-1 .",

    "( [ dfa ] ) . together with eq .",
    "( [ taufa ] ) , it leads to d_fa ~^- , with @xmath57 in the @xmath5 fa model case .",
    "this scaling is to be contrasted with the stokes ",
    "einstein result , @xmath58 .    numerical simulation @xcite and",
    "renormalization group analysis @xcite of higher dimension generalizations of the fa model indicate that for @xmath7 , @xmath59 .",
    "however , the scaling @xmath60 remains true for all dimensions as it is based solely on detailed balance .",
    "thus , for @xmath7 , @xmath61 . in other words",
    ", there is only a weak breakdown in the stokes ",
    "einstein relation for strong liquids in @xmath7 .    in the east model case ,",
    "both the diffusion coefficient and the relaxation time show super - arrhenius behavior .",
    "the hierarchical , fractal structure of pattern development in trajectory space for the east model does not allow a simple scaling analysis of the diffusion coefficient , and it is not obvious whether temperature independent scaling exists .",
    "one can define a temperature dependent scaling exponents , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 so that d_east ~^-()/z ( ) .",
    "interestingly , our numerical results indicate that @xmath65 is independent of temperature as shown in fig .",
    "this exponent , @xmath66 for the @xmath5 east model , is very close to what many experiments and simulations have found for three  dimensional glass forming liquids .",
    "for example , a recent experiment finds that @xmath67 in the self  diffusion of _",
    "tris_-naphthylbenzene(tnb ) @xcite .",
    "it was found that @xmath68 in a molecular dynamics simulation of lennard  jones binary mixture @xcite and a recent detailed scaling analysis of numerical results shows @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "presumably , such good agreement of scaling relation between the @xmath5 east model and higher dimension systems arises due to directional persistence of facilitation in the fragile liquid @xcite .",
    "this persistence in higher dimensions causes motion to be effectively one  dimensional @xcite .",
    "therefore , dimensionality is not very significant for fragile glass formers . as such , for fragile systems , we expect that the scaling relation of the stokes ",
    "einstein violation will be reasonably well described by the @xmath5 east model .",
    "based on this expectation , we further purse the comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "swallen _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite measured the self  translational diffusion coefficient of tnb near the glass transition temperature .",
    "they observed an increase of @xmath70 from its high temperature limit by a factor of 400 near the glass transition temperature . in order to compare our results with these experiments ,",
    "we need to determine the excitation concentration , @xmath34 , as function of temperature .",
    "since tnb behaves as a fragile liquid , we determine the excitation concentration as a function of temperature by fitting the viscosity data of tnb @xcite with the generalization of the east model formulas to higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "namely , ^2 , [ lntau ] where @xmath71 is the number of equally likely persistence directions on a cubic lattice , and ( c)= ( c_r)-j(1t-1t_r ) .",
    "[ lnc ] the parameter @xmath72 is the energy scale associated with creating a mobile region from an immobile region , and @xmath73 is an appropriate reference temperature .",
    "details on the fitting can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . taking @xmath74 ( the cubic lattice value ) and @xmath73 as the temperature",
    "at which @xmath75 is half the value of @xmath76 , we determine that @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . the reduced temperature , @xmath20 of the east model is related to absolute temperature by = j(1t-1t_r ) + ( g / c_r ) .",
    "once we have determined the excitation concentration as a function of the temperature , we can compare experimental data with our computed results for the stokes ",
    "einstein violation in the east model case . based on the argument that the scaling relation of the stokes ",
    "einstein violation ( @xmath79 ) remains robust in higher dimensions and from the dimensional dependence of eq .",
    "( [ lntau ] ) , we expect .",
    "[ east3d ] in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we use this relationship to compare the extent of the stokes ",
    "einstein violation of the experimental system with our east model results .",
    "the agreement between the two appears excellent .",
    "there have been previous theoretical studies on the violation of the stokes ",
    "einstein relation in supercooled liquid systems . for example , kivelson and tarjus have argued that the stokes ",
    "einstein violation can be understood from their `` frustration  limited domain '' model for supercooled liquids @xcite . assuming a distribution of local relaxation times associated with domain structures",
    ", this model describes the translational diffusion and viscosity as corresponding to different averaging process of such a distribution .",
    "their idea contrasts to ours in that the domain structure in their work is purely static , and the exchange between different domains are not considered .",
    "hodgdon and stillinger have proposed a fluidized domain model @xcite . in their work",
    ", it is assumed that the system consists of a sparse collection of fluid  like domains in a background of more viscous media , and fluid  like domains appear and disappear with a finite life  time and rate .",
    "relaxation times are determined by the rate of appearance of the fluid  like domains , while translation diffusion also depends on the life ",
    "time of the domains . to the extent that these domains refer to space  time and not simply space , this picture is not inconsistent with ours .",
    "xia and wolynes have applied the so  called `` random first order transition theory '' @xcite to the hodgdon ",
    "stillinger model @xcite . in this case , the picture is both mean field and static and decidedly contrary to our fluctuation dominated and dynamic view .    from the perspective that stokes ",
    "einstein violation is a manifestation of fluctuation dominated dynamics , one expects that similar decoupling behavior occurs between other kinds of transport properties near the glass transition .",
    "the extent to which such decoupling can appear depends upon microscopic details in the specific transport properties and materials under study .",
    "for example , molecular rotations of a probe will be coupled to the mobility field , but less so than translations .",
    "indeed , single molecule experiments indicate that rotations persist in both mobile and immobile regions of a glass former @xcite .",
    "rotational motions can therefore average the effects of dynamic heterogeneity to a greater extent than translational motions .",
    "as such , decoupling of rotational relaxation from structural relaxation can be more difficult to detect than violations of the stokes  einstein relation .",
    "precisely how such effects might be detected seems worthy of further theoretical analysis .",
