    "in this section , we outline some observational aspects of stellar magnetism that motivate and guide our work , and review previous theoretical studies of magnetic fields in m - dwarfs .",
    "it has long been argued that the seat of the global dynamo in solar - type stars resides in the tachocline , a region of shear at the interface between the differentially rotating convection zone and the stably stratified ( and rigidly rotating ) interior ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the appearance of starspots in distinct latitudinal bands on the sun and some solar - like stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) results essentially from the combined effects of magnetic buoyancy , magnetic tension , and coriolis forces that influence fibril magnetic structures as they rise ( for a review , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "some recent models have adopted the view that the tachocline may not play as crucial a role as previously believed ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and discussion below ) .",
    "but in many of these , the differential rotation is still regarded as crucial : either as a direct source of poloidal field from toroidal , or as a way of mitigating the effects of small - scale dynamo action @xcite .",
    "stars with masses @xmath1 m@xmath0 ( near the transition from spectral types m3 to m4 ) are fully convective , and so lack an interface region akin to the solar tachocline . but clearly stars on either side of this `` tachocline divide '' still effectively build magnetic fields  with , e.g. , chromospheric h@xmath2 emission , a common proxy for magnetic activity , increasingly prevalent in the late - m spectral types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although such stars do not possess a tachocline , it is natural to wonder whether internal shear ( i.e. , differential rotation ) might play a similar role , and whether any other signatures of the transition to full convection might be found in , for example , the patterns of magnetic activity visible at their surfaces .",
    "observations suggest that surface differential rotation is comparatively smaller for stars of lower effective temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast to the preferred toroidal belts of activity observed on the sun , starspots on even rapidly rotating m - dwarfs have been observed at all latitudes ( though clearly with far less precision than is possible in the solar case ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". it may be the case that polar starspot caps are the result of a predominantly dipolar magnetic field topology , as seen in some 3d global dynamo models of fully convective stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . however , it is also known that rapid rotation has a tendency to deflect buoyantly rising flux tubes poleward ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if such tubes were generated in the interior , they would also then tend to emerge near the poles .",
    "spots constitute only a part of the surface magnetism . while the surface magnetic field may reach a few kg , @xcite report that more than @xmath3 of the magnetic flux in early - to - mid m - dwarfs is on small scales .",
    "furthermore , a reduced starspot - induced light - curve variability in mid - to - late m - dwarfs compared to earlier spectral types suggest a more uniform distribution of starspots ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at some level , every star likely possesses a unique magnetic field topology , with both large - scale and small - scale surface fields contributing to the overall observed magnetic field strength .",
    "what remains clear is that dynamos in fully convective stars are capable of producing strong magnetic activity , in some cases without evident differential rotation .",
    "these magnetic fields may lead to observable starspots , which could exceed the latitude and filling factor of spots on the sun .",
    "the generation of magnetic fields by dynamo action in fully convective stars is an intricate process , and not especially well understood .",
    "one early suggestion was that such objects would host only a turbulent magnetic field , structured on small spatial scales @xcite . within the context of mean - field theory",
    ", @xcite later suggested that such stars host @xmath4 dynamos , with helical motions as the source of both the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "several authors have turned to magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) numerical simulations as a way of gauging the strength and morphology of the magnetism , which in turn arises from the combined influences of convection , rotation , and shear . in the context of fully convective stars specifically , @xcite have found that fields with a wide range of spatial scales can be built by the flows . under the strong rotational constraints typical of m - dwarfs",
    ", a non - trivial large - scale magnetic field component can be generated . in the global , anelastic mhd models of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "for example , the overall magnetic field grows until it is roughly in equipartition with the kinetic energy ( corresponding to average strengths of @xmath5 kg in different regions of the spherical domain ) . in both cases , the strong magnetism acts to reduce differential rotation present in hydrodynamic progenitor calculations .",
    "the spatial structure of the field varies somewhat in different models . in @xcite",
    "the field exhibits a strong dipolar component ( coexisting with smaller - scale features ) , whereas in @xcite the magnetic energy spectrum peaks at somewhat higher spherical harmonic degrees ( i.e. , smaller spatial scales ) . in the context of solar - like stars ,",
    "simulations have likewise suggested that strong and coherent mean fields ( both toroidal and poloidal ) may be built without a `` tachocline '' of shear , particularly if the overall influence of rotation is strong enough . in the simulations of @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , for example ,",
    "coherent `` wreaths '' of toroidal field are built amidst the convection , provided it is rotating rapidly enough .",
    "though these simulations operate in parameter regimes far removed from those realized in actual stars , surely influencing the character of the magnetism ( see e.g. , discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they are nonetheless suggestive of the sorts of organized fields that might be built by convection and rotation .",
    "these global - scale simulations are just beginning to capture some aspects of _ magnetic buoyancy _",
    ", long thought to play a role in stellar dynamos .",
    "magnetic buoyancy has been studied extensively using both analytical theory and simulations in localized domains ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the global simulations of a rapidly rotating convective envelope ( with no tachocline ) by @xcite self - consistently generate toroidal magnetic structures that rise under the combined influence of magnetic buoyancy and advection by convective flows . in those simulations ,",
    "such structures arise essentially as the high - strength tail of an extended distribution of field strengths : while typical field strengths are only a few kg , the buoyant loops occur only in regions with field strengths @xmath6 kg .",
    "the models described there are extraordinarily expensive to compute .",
    "indeed it is only by reaching a particularly low level of diffusion ( achieved through the use of a dynamic smagorinsky sub - grid - scale model ) that the buoyant loops begin to emerge naturally .",
    "any real stellar dynamo will produce magnetic structures with a wide range of spatial scales and field strengths . even in the absence of strong internal differential rotation",
    ", bands of coherent toroidal field may arise .",
    "for example , the simulations of @xcite or @xcite both yield toroidal fields that exceed 10 kg ( and are greater than the associated poloidal fields ) , despite the weak zonal flows . because the convection is comparatively weak in m - dwarfs , and rotation is often relatively rapid",
    ", even modest angular velocity contrasts of @xmath7 can still yield a considerable influence on the dynamo .",
    "turning to the simulations of @xcite as a qualitative guide , we might expect that pushing the simulations to even lower values of diffusivity ( and commensurately more turbulent flows ) would result in toroidal fields with stronger portions , even if the mean level of magnetic energy were not greatly changed .",
    "the strongest of these fields must feel the effects of magnetic buoyancy , and so begin to rise .",
    "the journey of magnetic fields from their region of generation to the stellar surface is complex .",
    "often the flux tube model is adopted to describe the dynamic evolution of magnetic field bundles .",
    "a rich body of work applying the flux tube model in the solar context has provided important insight into the flux emergence process .",
    "these simulations have been performed in both horizontal and spherical geometries , utilizing either a fully 3d mhd approach or the effectively 1d tft approximation ( for a comprehensive review , see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thin flux tube calculations have been useful in understanding the mechanisms driving the observed properties of solar active regions .",
    "they have been particularly helpful in elucidating the role that coriolis force plays in determining the latitude of emergence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , tilt of the active region toward the equator ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and morphological ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and geometrical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) asymmetries . unlike tft simulations , flux tube simulations of the 3d variety can resolve the cross - section of the tube and twist of the internal magnetic field lines .",
    "these simulations also capture the back - reaction of the magnetic structures on the surrounding plasma and the possible shredding of the flux tube by convection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , due to the limited numerical resolution and relatively high imposed magnetic diffusion of such 3d models , tubes with strong super - equipartition magnetic field strength and large radii are typically required , corresponding to a total flux often larger than observed active regions on the sun ( i.e. @xmath8 mx ) .",
    "note , though , that the radii of flux tubes in some 3d models , for instance @xcite and @xcite , are only @xmath93 times larger than in the simulations we present here ( see sec . [",
    "sec : init ] ) .",
    "although flux tube models can not address the self - consistent formation of magnetic field bundles , they are nonetheless instructive .",
    "in particular , they allow the flexibility of prescribing initial conditions both of the flux tube and the external environment to explore a variety of possible situations that may be realized in stars .",
    "@xcite examine the effect solar - like convection has on the local and global evolution of magnetic flux tubes while circumventing the problem of artificial diffusion by employing the tft model in a hydrodynamic convection simulation . while idealized , these simulations complement the results of both 3d mhd flux tube simulations and those of the buoyantly rising loops generated through dynamo action as in @xcite .",
    "namely , they show that both magnetic buoyancy and convection contribute to the flux emergence process , acting in concert to replicate the observed properties of solar active regions .",
    "additionally , as the tft model is a 1d code , simulations of individual flux tubes may be performed quickly on single processor machines , much faster than 3d simulations requiring millions of processor hours on massively parallel supercomputers .    inspired by the growing number of observations of fully convective stars and encouraged by the results obtained from previous tft simulations",

    "it is also clear that the buoyant flux tubes discussed in this section attempt to achieve a state of horizontal equilibrium early in their evolution . especially in the upper convection zone",
    ", the initial imbalance of horizontal forces can bring the tube into shallower layers before a horizontal equilibrium is found . in stars with strong differential rotation , assuming the tubes",
    "are built co - rotating with the local plasma , this will bring the tube outward into layers with increasingly prograde motion . while the azimuthal drag force has no effect on axisymmetric flux tubes in our formulation ( other than the prescribed @xmath78 here ) , tubes that develop distinct buoyantly rising loops due to convective motions could be pushed prograde through the drag force acting on the loop legs .",
    "this additional supply of angular momentum will reduce the poleward deflection of the rising loop , and may help to achieve lower latitude flux emergence ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in section [ sec : tubes_conv ]",

    "since we do include a radiative heating term in our model , we briefly examine its effects here .",

    "it is necessary to eliminate the radial oscillations the flux tube executes .",

    "this entails adopting a slightly modified initial azimuthal velocity @xmath135 by eliminating the oscillations , the rise time and trajectory of the flux tube are changed somewhat , however the relevant conclusion remains the same : namely that the evolution of even the weakest flux tube we consider is mostly adiabatic , with the exception of a short distance across the deep interior .    for this purposes of this paper , we are mostly interested in assessing how turbulent convective flows influence the buoyant rise of active - region - scale flux tubes in a fully convective star . in the following sections , we will include radiative heating in all simulations , comparing flux tubes rising in a quiescent convection zone to those allowed to evolve under the influence of convective flows .      as mentioned in section [ sec : init ] , flux tubes originating in an isothermal radiative interior will cool as they rise through the region , achieving neutral buoyancy .",
    "if the tube is located outside the equatorial plane , the poleward component of the unbalanced magnetic tension will force the tube to move latitudinally , closer to the rotation axis .",
    "this in turn induces a prograde flow of plasma inside the tube due to the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "eventually a state will be reached where the buoyancy force vanishes and the inward directed magnetic tension is balanced by the now outward directed coriolis force .",

    "the journey of an active - region - scale flux tube from its region of generation to the near - surface is in part shaped by the local and mean flows it encounters .",

    "[ fig : convection_tubes]g-[fig : convection_tubes]l ) subject to the _ slow _ differential rotation profile ( tlsc ) , where the tubes are assumed to have been built co - rotating with the surrounding plasma .",
    "all flux tubes in figure [ fig : convection_tubes ] are initialized at the same time , and therefore experience initially the same time - varying radial and latitudinal flows .",
    "figure [ fig : vexrandr_0.5r ] complements the top row of figure [ fig : convection_tubes ] , depicting the time evolution of the same flux tubes in the @xmath149 plane , as well as the radial flows acting on each flux tube segment .",
    "we have chosen to present figure [ fig : vexrandr_0.5r ] only for representative case tlfc tubes initiated at 0.5r as an example of how radial convective flows modulate the initial axisymmetric shape of the flux tube .",
    "for flux tubes of similar cross - sectional radius @xmath10 , the severity of the distortion by convective flows increases with decreasing magnetic field strength ( i.e. from right to left in fig .",
    "[ fig : convection_tubes ] , top to bottom in fig .",
    "[ fig : vexrandr_0.5r ] ) .",
    "simply , tubes of larger magnetic field have a greater magnetic tension and a stronger buoyancy force compared to the aerodynamic drag imparted by the turbulent flows , rendering the tube less susceptible to convection .",
    "this means that tubes of larger @xmath58 evolve more like the axisymmetric flux tubes in a quiescent medium described in section [ sec : dynamic ] .",
    "imprinted upon the shape of the flux tube at any moment is both the history of convective flows it has encountered as well as artifacts from more recent flows .",
    "small perturbations to the tube from flows in the deeper interior may continue to grow as material drains from a peak along the tube to a trough .",
    "the peak will continue to rise toward the surface , sometimes being boosted by an upflow , while other times pummeled by a strong downflow .",
    "for example , the 30 kg case tlfc flux tube initiated at 0.5r , depicted in figure [ fig : convection_tubes]a and the bottom row of figure [ fig : vexrandr_0.5r ] , develops small undulations in the deep interior that grow as the peaks along the tube rise into less dense layers . by the time",
    "the fastest rising peak reaches the upper boundary , which we will subsequently refer to as the flux tube _ apex _ , the tube has developed multiple loops with troughs that extend to as deep as 0.6r . a strong downflow passes across the apex of the flux tube as it nears the surface , creating a double peaked feature in the rising loop between @xmath9@xmath150 longitude in the last timestep , as shown in figure [ fig : vexrandr_0.5r]i .",
    "even when subjected to convective flows , both case tlfc and tlsc flux tube initiated at a depth of 0.5r still have a mean motion that is largely parallel to the rotation axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : convection_tubes ] , first and third rows ) .",
    "the broader , weaker radial flows in the mid - convection zone are enough to perturb flux tubes of weaker @xmath58 , creating rising loops with troughs residing in much deeper layers . however , at this depth , radial flows are not strong enough to bring the apex radially outward , nor is the differential rotation profile strong enough to force the loop to deviate much from parallel motion toward the poles . as the magnetic field strength @xmath58 of the tube increases ,",
    "the development of loop - like features only begins to occur as the ring - like tube reaches shallower regions of the convection zone where the radial motions increase in magnitude and have smaller spatial scales ( see figure [ fig : vexrandr_0.5r ] ) .",
    "differential rotation ( and the assumed @xmath78 inside the tube ) plays only a small role here : the evolution of the 200 kg case tlfc and tlsc flux tubes initiated at 0.5r in figure [ fig : convection_tubes]c and [ fig : convection_tubes]i are nearly indistinguishable .",
    "flux tubes originating at 0.75r can evolve differently ; in particular , not all exhibit a mean motion parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "for example , the 30 kg case tlfc flux tube in figure [ fig : convection_tubes]d and the 200 kg case tlfc tube in figure [ fig : convection_tubes]f exhibit lower latitude emergence than their counterparts evolving in the slow differential rotation profile ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : convection_tubes]j and [ fig : convection_tubes]l ) .",

    "not shown here , all case tlfc flux tubes of @xmath155 kg have an apex @xmath153 at the simulation upper boundary that is retrograde , and commensurate with conservation of angular momentum . ]    the major trend that emerges from the average rise times in figure [ fig : risetimes ] is the tendency in most cases for the apex rise to roughly follow the rise of the axisymmetric flux rings evolving without convection . weaker @xmath156 kg flux tubes initiated at low latitudes at 0.5r subject to both differential rotation profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : risetimes]a and [ fig : risetimes]c ) rise slower than the same flux tubes rising through a quiescent convection zone .",
    "this is indicative of magnetic pumping , which we further address in section [ sec : pump ] .",
    "however , a stronger differential rotation profile can drastically _ shorten _ the rise of initially low latitude @xmath152 kg ( case tlfc ) flux tubes originating at 0.75r , as shown in figure [ fig : risetimes]b and discussed in more detail below .    even though convection can modulate the tube , generating loops that extend over a large portion of the convection zone , the tendency for portions of the tube to approach horizontal equilibrium and rise parallel to the rotation axis is robust in most cases .",
    "figure [ fig : theta_em ] depicts this trend .",
    "the black dashed lines in figure [ fig : theta_em ] plot the emergence latitude at 0.95r expected if the flux tube rises purely vertically , following the relationship @xmath157 where @xmath81 is the latitude and @xmath158 is the top of the simulation domain . for both differential rotation profiles , the 200 kg flux tubes initiated at 0.75r deviate substantially from the emergence latitude predicted by equation [ eqn : theta_parallel ] . additionally , @xmath152 kg flux tubes of @xmath159 initiated at the same depth subject to the fast differential rotation profile are able to emerge at much lower latitudes than either flux tubes evolving without convection or the prediction of equation [ eqn : theta_parallel ] ( see panel [ fig : theta_em]a ) .",
    "phenomenologically , we can explain the reduced rise times and deflected latitudinal emergence of the 30 - 40 kg case tlfc flux tubes by appealing to the differential rotation profile . in the upper @xmath160 of the convection zone at low latitudes ,",
    "the differential rotation is strongly prograde ( see fig . [",
    "fig : diffrotprof]a ) . at this depth",
    ", the initial horizontal force imbalance causes the case tlfc flux tubes to move outward into shallower layers as compared to the case tlsc tubes owing to the larger initially outward coriolis force ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamic ] ) .",
    "buoyant loops develop from modulation by convection .",
    "these loops rise subject to the prograde azimuthal flow , which supplies angular momentum as the loop crosses contours of constant @xmath89 .",
    "the retrograde flow of plasma along the flux tube expected from conservation of angular momentum will be reduced , and may even turn prograde .",
    "a prograde azimuthal flow near the apex , if established , induces outward and equatorward components of the coriolis force , accelerating the loop toward the surface and helping it to emerge at lower latitudes .",
    "furthermore , the distance the flux tube travels while executing a more radial trajectory is shorter than a trajectory parallel to the rotation axis , also reducing the rise time .",
    "we point out that in the absence of convection , case tlf flux tubes initiated at 0.75r at low latitudes move horizontally outward to only @xmath90.81r before moving parallel to the rotation axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : choud_plot]a ) .",
    "the departure from the nearly parallel trajectories of 30 - 40 kg case tlfc flux tubes initiated in this same region is then a result of modulation by the time - varying flows and the strongly prograde differential rotation . to further emphasize this , figure [ fig : vph ] shows a scatter plot of the azimuthal speed @xmath153 attained by the fastest rising apex of each @xmath152 kg case tlfc flux tube at 0.95r as a function of emergence latitude .",
    "the drag force from the prograde @xmath89 acting on portions of the rising loop perpendicular to the mean azimuthal flow field has given the apex a positive azimuthal speed for nearly all 30 - 40 kg flux tubes that emerge at latitudes @xmath161 .",
    "as the relevant components of the magnetic buoyancy and tension forces that drive parallel motion are comparatively smaller in 30 - 40 kg flux tubes , the trajectories of their rising apices are more easily accelerated equatorward by the application of differential rotation .",
    "the tft simulations of @xcite similarly find that the application of a differential rotation profile reduced the emergence latitude of buoyantly rising loops in the solar context .",
    "the 200 kg flux tubes initiated at 0.75r ( both case tlfc and tlsc ) achieve low latitude emergence in a slightly different way than the 30 - 40 kg case tlfc tubes .",
    "the large excess of the outward forces acting on the flux tube compared to the inward forces quickly moves the tube outward to @xmath162r before horizontal equilibrium is achieved and the motion turns parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "subsequently , the emergence latitude deviates more significantly from what is predicted by equation [ eqn : theta_parallel ] .",
    "this is visible in figure [ fig : no_conv]b and figure [ fig : choud_plot]c , where the motion parallel to the rotation axis of the 200 kg flux tube occurs much closer to the surface .",
    "modulation of the flux tube by the more vigorous , smaller scale convection in these layers perturbs the tube enough to allow portions to reach the upper boundary before the mean motion of the tube can move significantly poleward .",
    "this effect is not strongly dependent on differential rotation , and likewise the initial @xmath78 established inside the flux tube .",

    "similar to tft models in stars with small radiative cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this is partly a consequence of reduced flux tube buoyancy in the deeper interior and a reduced magnetic tension at lower latitudes ( compared to higher latitudes at the same radial depth ) .",
    "our results suggest that emerging flux tubes , if produced in the interior , could plausibly account for the appearance of starspots at mid - to - high latitudes .",
    "but what of lower latitude spots , especially those appearing near the equator ?",
    "there are a few possible scenarios to explain the appearance of very low latitude starspots : ( 1 ) the magnetic field strength @xmath58 of progenitor flux tubes are strongly super - equipartition , ( 2 ) the differential rotation profile in the interior is much stronger than what is observed at the surface , ( 3 ) the tubes eventually emerging at the surface are generated in much shallower regions than what is accessible through our tft simulations given our choice of @xmath58 and magnetic flux of @xmath190 mx , ( 4 ) the active regions are a grouping of much smaller magnetic flux bundles , with @xmath191 mx . to truly elucidate the processes responsible for equatorial and low - latitude starspots in fully convective star ,",
    "more work is needed .",
    "we speculate that the longitudinal extent of active regions that may be produced by our simulations is limited by the size of the cellular convective structures in the upper convection zone , where radial downflows have the strongest amplitudes .",
    "similar to the tft simulations of @xcite in the solar convection zone , strong downflow lanes at the edges of giant cells might contribute to a preferential longitudinal emergence of active regions .",
    "addressing the ` spottedness ' of the star , in particular the percentage of starspot coverage on the surface at any time , is beyond the scope of the simulations presented here .",
    "like all simulations of stellar convection and magnetic flux emergence , we have made a number of simplifications in our modeling .",
    "many of these stem from the fundamental assumptions and numerical requirements of the anelastic and tft approximations .",
    "arguably , the most significant assumption we have made is that dynamo action in a fully convective star builds coherent , individual flux tubes in a toroidal geometry distributed throughout the bulk of the interior .",
    "the true nature of dynamo generated magnetic fields in the interior of any star is still largely unknown . in fully convective stars , it may well be the case that the poloidal field plays a role in flux emergence as well , rather than the toroidal field alone .",
    "the tft approximation also does not resolve the cross - section of the flux tube , assuming that it always remains circular with a radius @xmath192 .",
    "as the tube rises , it expands and attains greater speeds .",
    "a flux tube moving transversely through a fluid will feel a pressure excess on the leading and trailing surfaces , with a pressure deficit on the sides .",
    "such a pressure difference could flatten the flux tube into a ribbon - like shape , reducing the rise speed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the tube may fragment or become shredded by convective motions , perhaps developing a more umbrella - shaped cross - section ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this could effectively be captured in the drag force of the tft model by varying the drag coefficient as the tube rises .",
    "we plan to investigate this effect in the future in the solar context .",
    "we have employed an angular velocity @xmath1932.6@xmath26 rad s@xmath27 , comparable to the sun . for a star of radius 2.0@xmath79 cm",
    ", this implies a rotational velocity @xmath194 km s@xmath27 , below the current @xmath195 km s@xmath27 detection limit for doppler broadening ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from an observational standpoint ,",
    "our simulations are essentially non - rotating , with some m - dwarf rotational velocities exceeding @xmath196 km s@xmath27 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "investigation of dynamo action and flux emergence in more rapidly rotating , fully convective stars have been planned for the future .",
    "broadly , we anticipate that more rapidly rotating objects would show an even stronger tendency towards flux emergence near the poles .",
    "rapid rotation may also alter the ` giant cell ' convective structure pattern ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our choice of flux tube initial conditions and the treatment of the external velocity field could , in some cases , contribute to our results in a non - negligible way .",
    "foremost among these is assuming a density deficit inside the tube prescribed by the condition of teq , resulting in a substantial buoyancy force compared to the neutrally buoyant state of flux tubes in meq .",
    "it may well be the case that flux tubes are built in a state somewhere between these extremes .",
    "the assumption that flux tubes are built co - rotating with the local plasma , initializing a flow @xmath78 inside the tube , also plays a role in the subsequent force evolution . modeling flux tubes with a smaller cross - sectional radius @xmath10 than the chosen @xmath92@xmath71 cm could result in more examples of low latitude emergence , as such tubes are advected more strongly by convective flows .",
    "it is also likely that the strong magnetic fields we consider could quench the differential rotation , reducing the angular velocity contrast , similar to that of case cm in @xcite .",
    "the method we use to treat the external velocity field , discussed in section [ sec : ash ] , does not take into account corresponding changes made to the time - varying radial and longitudinal velocity field due to dynamo action .",
    "however , we point out that the amplitudes of the radial velocity field and nature of the giant - cell convection in the hydrodynamic simulation used here is commensurate with case cm",
    ". the amplitude of the meridional circulation established in either case likely contributes little to flux tube evolution .",
    "the modeling approach we take is advantageous in that we can prescribe a number of parameters to see how flux tubes initiated in different regions of the star with various magnetic field strengths may behave .",
    "while our tubes are not generated self - consistently , we can evaluate many possible flux tubes that may exist , and examine how they might behave under certain external conditions .",
    "although observations of m - dwarfs are increasing in number , detailed and long term observations of active regions on these stars is limited .",
    "our understanding of stellar magnetism is largely driven by what we have observed on the sun .",
    "ideally , we would hope to retrieve information about whether uniform starspot coverage is the norm , if active regions are mostly bipolar as they are on the sun , and if so , whether they exhibit tilting toward the equator following joy s law , and/or opposite polarities in opposite hemispheres following hale s law .",
    "such detailed observations of individual active regions on any star other than the sun are likely years in the future .",
    "until then , we turn to theory and simulations to guide our knowledge of the in - depth operation of stellar dynamos .",
    "the tft simulations we have presented here serve to complement existing 3d dynamo simulations of fully convective stars , providing a link between dynamo - generated magnetic fields , fluid motions , and starspots .",
