    "kepler s two - wheel mission , k2 , has been in operation since 2014 @xcite .",
    "k2 observes a number of campaign fields in the ecliptic plane for about 83 days each , and releases photometric data at intervals of about 3 months . because many of the proposed target stars for k2 are somewhat brighter than the planet - hosting stars discovered by the original kepler mission , the planets discovered by k2 are often good targets for further characterization .",
    "for this reason , planet searches based on k2 photometric data and subsequent follow - up observations are being conducted by many groups @xcite .",
    "epic201505350 ( also designated k2 - 19 ) is one of the multi - transiting planetary systems discovered in campaign field 1 @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of this system is that two transiting planets ( k2 - 19b and k2 - 19c ) have orbits that are close to a 3:2 mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) .",
    "the formation of 3:2 mmr planet pairs through planetary migration has been the subject of extensive theoretical investigations ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; however , the number of 3:2 mmr pairs actually discovered to date is still small .",
    "thus k2 - 19 offers the prospect of a well - characterized example for theoretical studies of planet formation , as one can determine the mass , radius , and density of both planets , at least in principle .",
    "the phenomenon of transit - timing variations ( ttvs ) can be used to estimate the mass of planets that are in or near resonances @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies have shown that the ttv of near - mmr planet pairs can be calculated analytically @xcite , facilitating the analysis .",
    "as both k2 - 19b and c are transiting , it may be possible to determine or constrain the mass of both planets through ttv monitoring .",
    "ground - based transit follow - up observations for this system are very important , since the monitoring period of k2 was limited to about 83 days .",
    "even though no ttv were detected during the interval of the k2 observations , recently reported on subsequent observations of k2 - 19b using the nites 0.4 m telescope and showed that the planet experienced a large ttv .",
    "they used a formula by @xcite to put an upper bound of @xmath11300 m@xmath12 on the masses of k2 - 19b and c. further transit follow - up observations are needed to place a more stringent upper bound , or to determine the masses of the planets .",
    "another interesting feature of k2 - 19 is that the inner planet is a super - neptune with the radius of about 7  @xmath13 ( or 0.7  @xmath14 ) .",
    "based on an examination of the nasa exoplanet archive @xcite , planets in that size range appear to be relatively infrequent among the sample of known transiting planets . only a small number of super - neptune - sized planets , such as hats-7b ( @xmath15=13.34 , @xcite ) and hats-8b ( @xmath15=14.03 , @xcite ) , have been discovered .",
    "further , k2 - 19 is a unique mmr system in that the inner planet ( super - neptune - size ) is about 1.7 times bigger than the outer planet ( neptune - size ) .",
    "this is not the case for the majority of 3:2 mmr planet pairs discovered by the kepler @xcite , as discussed later in this paper .",
    "those facts make it interesting to investigate the origin of k2 - 19 system as well as the internal and atmospheric compositions of both planets .",
    "another issue regarding this system is that the stellar parameters of the host star , such as the stellar mass and radius , have been characterized with only low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr of @xmath16 ) , moderately high spectral resolution ( @xmath17 ) spectra ( see ) .",
    "thus there is room for improvement in the estimation of stellar parameters with higher snr and higher spectral resolution spectra .",
    "furthermore , the possibility has not yet been excluded that there is a faint neighboring star with the photometric aperture of the k2 detector , which could be responsible for the transit signals or which could affect the observed amplitude of the signals .",
    "both characterization of the host star with high dispersion spectroscopy and high - contrast direct imaging are important for a precise determination of the masses and radii of the planets .    motivated by the preceding considerations , we have conducted three types of ground - based follow - up observations .",
    "the first one is high - dispersion spectroscopy to characterize the host star .",
    "the second one is high - contrast adaptive - optics ( ao ) imaging to check on any possible contamination from a faint companion star .",
    "the third one is ground - based time - series photometry of transits , to measure additional transit times and enhance the ttv analysis .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce our observations and reduction procedures in section  2 .",
    "we describe our analysis methods and results in section  3 .",
    "based on the derived transit parameters , we further analyze the ttvs of the planets in section  4.1 .",
    "we also discuss possible internal compositions and origins of the planets from a theoretical point of view in section  4.2 and 4.3 .",
    "finally , we summarize our study in section  5 .",
    "in order to improve on estimates of the stellar parameters , we observed k2 - 19 with high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) on the subaru 8.2 m telescope on 2015 may 29 ( ut ) . to maximize the snr as well as to achieve a sufficient spectral resolution",
    ", we employed the image slicer # 2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; @xmath18 ) and the standard i2a setup , simultaneously covering the spectral range between 4950 - 7550 @xmath19 with the two ccd chips . the raw spectrum was subjected to the standard iraf procedures to extract the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectrum .",
    "the wavelength scale was established by observations of the comparison thorium - argon lamp taken during evening and morning twilight .",
    "the exposure time was 20 minutes .",
    "the 1d spectrum has a snr of @xmath20 per pixel in the vicinity of the sodium d lines .",
    "we observed k2 - 19 in the @xmath21 band with the hiciao @xcite combined with the ao188 ( 188 element curvature sensor adaptive optics system : @xcite ) , mounted on the 8.2 m subaru telescape on 2015 may 8 ( ut ) .",
    "we used the target star itself as a natural guide star for ao188 , and employed an atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) to prevent the star from drifting on the detector due to differential refraction between the visible and near - infrared bands .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) was @xmath22 , and the typical ao - corrected seeing was @xmath23 on the night of our observations .",
    "the observations were conducted in the pupil tracking mode to enable the angular differential imaging ( adi ; @xcite ) technique .",
    "we took 35 object frames with an exposure time of 30  s. the total exposure time was 17.5  min .",
    "as a first step in the reduction , we removed a characteristic stripe bias pattern from each image @xcite .",
    "then , bad pixel and flat field correction were performed .",
    "finally , the image distortions were corrected , using calibration images of the globular cluster m5 that were obtained on the same night .",
    "we observed one transit of k2 - 19 on 2015 january 28 ( ut ) with the 1.2 m telescope at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) on mt.hopkins , arizona .",
    "we used keplercam , which is equipped with a @xmath24 pixel ccd with a @xmath25@xmath26@xmath25 fov .",
    "we observed through a sloan @xmath27 filter .",
    "the exposure time was 30 s. debiasing and flat - fielding ( using dome flats ) were performed using standard iraf procedures .",
    "aperture photometry was performed with custom routines written in the interactive data language ( idl ) .",
    "we selected the final aperture size of 7 pixels in the 2@xmath262 binning configuration , which means the radius of the aperture is about @xmath28 . the sky level per pixel",
    "was estimated from the median value in an annulus surrounding the aperture , with a radius that is about twice the aperture radius .",
    "the time of each exposure was recorded in ut , and the systematic error of the recorded time with respect to the standard clock was much smaller than the statistical uncertainty for the mid - transit time .",
    "one transit of k2 - 19b was observed on the night of 2015 feb 28 ( ut ) with the 0.6 m trappist robotic telescope ( transiting planets and planetesimals small telescope ) , located at eso la silla observatory ( chile ) .",
    "trappist is equipped with a thermoelectrically - cooled 2k@xmath262k ccd , which has a pixel scale of @xmath29 that translates into a @xmath30 fov . for details of trappist , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the transit was observed in an astrodon exoplanet ( blue - blocking ) filter that has a transmittance over 90% from 500  nm to beyond 1000  nm .",
    "the exposure time was 10 s. the time of each exposure was recorded in hjd@xmath31 . during the run , the positions of the stars on the chip were maintained to within a few pixels thanks to a software guiding system that regularly derives an astrometric solution for the most recently acquired image and sends pointing corrections to the mount if needed . after a standard pre - reduction ( bias , dark , and flat - field correction ) , the stellar fluxes were extracted from the images using the iraf / daophot aperture photometry software @xcite . after testing several sets of reduction parameters , we chose the one giving the most precise photometry for the stars of similar brightness as the target .",
    "differential photometry of the target star was performed relative to a selected set of reference stars .",
    "the set of reference stars was chosen as the one that gives the lowest root - mean - square ( rms ) transit light curve .",
    "it consists of nine stable stars of similar brightness and color to the target .",
    "we observed one transit of k2 - 19b with a new multi - color camera , named muscat , installed on the 1.88 m telescope in okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) on 2015 april 25 ( ut ) . on that night , a full transit was predicted to be observable based on the ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "however , based on the updated ephemeris of ( taking ttvs into account ) only a partial transit was predicted to be observable .",
    "muscat equips 3 ccd cameras and has a capability of 3-color simultaneous imaging in @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 bands of astrodon sloan gen 2 filters @xcite .",
    "each ccd camera has a @xmath35@xmath26@xmath35 fov , with a pixel scale of about @xmath36 . for the @xmath32 and @xmath33 band observations",
    ", we employed the high - speed readout mode ( 2 mhz , corresponding readout time of about 0.58 s and readout noise of @xmath37 e@xmath38 ) . for the @xmath34 band observations we used the low - speed readout mode ( 100 khz , corresponding to readout time of about 10 s and readout noise of @xmath39 e@xmath38 ) because at that time the @xmath34-band ccd was affected by excess readout noise ( over @xmath40 e@xmath38 ) in the high - speed readout mode .",
    "the exposure times were 60 s , 30 s , and 60 s for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 bands , respectively .",
    "bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and aperture photometry are performed by a customized pipeline @xcite .",
    "aperture radii are selected as 17 , 18 , and 19 pixels for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 bands , respectively .",
    "sky level is measured in the annulus with the inner radius of 45 pixels and the outer radius of 55 pixels . for differential",
    "photometry , we select a reference star ucac4 453 - 052399 ( @xmath41=12.53 , @xmath42=12.11 , @xmath43=11.96 , @xmath44=11.08 ) , which is slightly brighter than the target star ( @xmath41=13.36 , @xmath42=12.76 , @xmath43=12.57 , @xmath44=11.60 ) .",
    "the aperture radii and the reference star were chosen so that rms of residuals for trial transit fittings are minimized .      for a more comprehensive transit analysis",
    ", we also analyze the previously published data from the nites ( near infra - red transiting exoplanets : @xcite ) 0.4 m telescope in the same manner as our own data .",
    "the nites data are identical with those presented by .",
    "the transit observed by nites was the same as the one observed by trappist .",
    "using the high - resolution spectrum obtained with subaru / hds , we extract the atmospheric parameters ( the effective temperature @xmath45 , surface gravity @xmath46 , metallicity [ fe / h ] , and microturbulent velocity @xmath47 ) by measuring the equivalent widths of iron i / ii lines @xcite , which are widely distributed throughout the observed wavelength region .",
    "we then translate those atmospheric parameters into estimates of the stellar mass and radius , using the yonsei - yale stellar - evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "finally , the projected stellar rotation velocity @xmath48 is estimated by fitting the observed spectrum with the theoretically - generated intrinsic stellar absorption line profile , convolved with a kernel taking into account rotational and macroturbulent broadening @xcite and the instrumental profile ( ip ) of subaru / hds .",
    "the theoretical synthetic spectrum was taken from atlas9 model ( a plane - parallel stellar atmosphere model in lte : @xcite ) .",
    "the result of the spectroscopic analysis is summarized in table  [ table : hds ] .",
    "see @xcite for details on how the uncertainties in these spectroscopic parameters are determined .",
    "the derived parameters are consistent with those reported by , and have a higher precision by about an order of magnitude thanks to higher snr spectra .",
    "we also find that the host star is likely older than @xmath118 gyr , which is far older than the typical planet formation and migration timescale ( @xmath49 yr , see also section 4.2 ) .",
    "we employ the locally optimized combination of images ( loci : @xcite ) algorithm to maximize the efficiency of the adi technique and to search for fainter objects in the inner region around k2 - 19 .",
    "we estimate our achieved contrast ratio as follows .",
    "the final image of a loci pipeline is convolved with the psf of the unsaturated image .",
    "the 1@xmath50 limit on the contrast ratio is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the pixel values inside an annulus of width 6 pixels to the stellar flux in the unsaturated image",
    ". then the contrast ratio is corrected for a self - subtraction effect , which is estimated from the recovery rate of injected signals .",
    "figure  [ snmap ] shows a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) map of a loci - reduced image around k2 - 19 ( north is up and east is to the left ) .",
    "there are no other faint sources around k2 - 19 with snr exceeding 5 , except for a faint source located at the west - northwest edge of the image ( @xmath1111@xmath515 from the center ) .",
    "the faint source has a contrast of @xmath52 relative to the brightness of k2 - 19 and locates outside the kepler s psf .",
    "thus the presence of the faint source does not affect the light curves from k2 and other ground - based telescopes .",
    "we plot the 5@xmath50 contrast limit in figure  [ contrast ] .",
    "contrast limits of @xmath53 and @xmath1110@xmath54 are achieved at distances of at 0@xmath514 and 1  from the host star , respectively .",
    "thus we have not identified any contaminating faint object which can dilute or mimic the transits of k2 - 19b and k2 - 19c .",
    "we analyze the light curve for k2 - 19 that has been produced from the raw pixel data by the esprint collaboration .",
    "see @xcite for a description of the procedures for extracting the light curve from the k2 pixel data .",
    "we fit the k2 light curve by the procedure below and derive the best - fit system parameters along with mid - transit times .",
    "first , we separate the entire light curve into fourteen segments , each of which spans a transit .",
    "three of the segments involve double transits ( see figure  [ k2mutual ] ) , during which two planets simultaneously transit the host star .",
    "we note that did not model those mutual transit events .",
    "each segment includes the data within @xmath55 hours of the predicted ingress / egress times ( based on the ephemeris by ) , which is sufficient to span the transit event as well as some time beforehand and afterward . for each segment , we compute the standard deviation of the out - of - transit fluxes , and adopt the standard deviation as an initial estimate of the uncertainty in each flux value .",
    "all the light curve segments are fitted simultaneously with the common system parameters along with mid - transit time(s ) for each segment .",
    "we compute the posterior distributions for those parameters based on the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm , assuming that the likelihood is proportional to @xmath56 where @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the @xmath43-th observed k2 flux and its error , respectively .",
    "we employ the transit model by @xcite integrated over the 29.4-minute averaging time of the _ kepler _ data .",
    "we neglect the impact of any possible planet - planet eclipses @xcite on the light curve shape , due to the rather sparse sampling of the k2 data . finally , to obtain the model flux @xmath60 , the integrated light curve model for each segment is multiplied by a second - order polynomial function of time , representing the longer - timescale flux variations at the time of the transit .",
    "therefore , the adjustable parameters in our model are ( for each planet ) the scaled semi - major axis @xmath61 , the transit impact parameter @xmath62 , and the planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath63 ; the quadratic limb - darkening parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; the mid - transit time(s ) @xmath66 for each segment ; and the coefficients of the second - order polynomials . because the sparse sampling of the k2 data relative to the timescale of ingress and egress prohibits us from constraining the orbital eccentricity @xmath67 of either planet based only on the transit light curve @xcite , we simply assume @xmath68 for both planets .    following the procedure described in @xcite ,",
    "we compute the posterior distributions for the parameters listed above ; we first optimize equation ( [ eq : chisq ] ) using powell s conjugate direction method , allowing all the relevant parameters to vary . at this point",
    ", we compute the level of time - correlated noise @xmath69 ( so - called red noise : @xcite ) for each segment , and inflate the errors in each segment by @xmath69 .",
    "we then fix the coefficients of the polynomial functions to the optimized values and perform the mcmc computation starting from the initial best - fit values for the other parameters .",
    "the step size for each parameter is iteratively optimized such that the final acceptance ratio over the whole chain is between 1535% .",
    "we extend the chains to @xmath70 links , given the relatively large number of free parameters .",
    "we employ the median , and 15.87 and 84.13 percentiles of the marginalized posterior distribution of each parameter to convey the representative value and its @xmath71 errors . as a check on convergence ,",
    "we repeat the analysis after changing the initial input values for the system parameters , and find no dependence on the initial values .",
    "we report the values and uncertainties of the basic transit parameters in table  [ table : k2 ] , and we report the mid - transit times as well as the @xmath69 factor for each segment in table  [ table : k2tc ] . combining the @xmath72 values with the @xmath73 value listed in table  [ table : hds ] , we estimate the planetary radii of k2 - 19b and k2 - 19c as @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . the planetary radii",
    "are also presented in table  [ table : k2 ] .",
    "our procedure for modeling the ground - based transit light curves follows @xcite .",
    "first , the time stamps of the photometric data are placed onto the @xmath76 system using the code by @xcite .",
    "we check all the light curves by eye and eliminate obvious outliers .",
    "we then fit the transit light curves simultaneously , using an analytic transit light curve model and various choices to describe the more gradual out - of - transit ( baseline ) flux variations .",
    "we adopt baseline model functions @xmath77 described as follows , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the normalization factor , @xmath80 are observed variables , and @xmath81 are the coefficients @xcite . in order to select the most appropriate baseline models for the light curves , we adopt the bayesian information criteria ( bic : schwarz 1978 ) .",
    "the bic value is given by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the number of free parameters , and @xmath84 is the number of data points . for the variables",
    "@xmath80 , we test various combinations of time ( @xmath85 ) , airmass ( @xmath86 ) , the relative centroid positions in x ( @xmath87 ) and y ( @xmath88 ) , and the sky background counts ( @xmath89 ) . in addition",
    ", we also allowed an additional factor @xmath90 to account for a change of the normalization factor after the meridian flip for the trappist light curve .",
    "based on minimum bic , we adopt @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 to be fitting parameters for flwo and muscat ; @xmath79 , @xmath86 , and @xmath90 for trappist ; and @xmath79 and @xmath85 for nites , respectively .    for the transit light curve model",
    ", we employ a customized code @xcite that use the analytic formula by @xcite .",
    "the formula is equivalent to that of @xcite when using the quadratic limb - darkening law , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the intensity and @xmath93 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the line from the position of the stellar surface to the stellar center .",
    "we refer the tables of quadratic limb - darkening parameters by , and compute allowed @xmath94 and @xmath95 values for @xmath96 5300 k or 5400 k and @xmath97 4.0 or 4.5 , based on the stellar parameters presented in table  [ table : hds ] .",
    "we adopt uniform priors for @xmath94 and @xmath95 as follows : [ 0.59 , 0.61 ] and [ 0.24 , 0.34 ] for flwo @xmath27 , [ 0.77 , 0.85 ] and [ 0.67 , 0.82 ] for muscat @xmath32 , [ 0.68 , 0.70 ] and [ 0.35 , 0.46 ] for muscat @xmath33 , [ 0.52 , 0.55 ] and [ 0.17 , 0.26 ] for muscat @xmath34 , and [ 0.67 , 0.70 ] and [ 0.38 , 0.50 ] for trappist and nites .",
    "we assume an orbital period @xmath98 days and a reference epoch for the transits @xmath99 , the values reported by based on the nites data .",
    "we note that these assumptions have little impact on the resultant transit parameters , because we allow @xmath100 to be a free parameter , and the uncertainty in @xmath101 is negligible .",
    "to constrain the mid - transit times precisely even without complete coverage of the entire transit event , we place an _ a priori _ constraint on the total transit duration , @xmath102 , based on our k2 analysis .",
    "we allow @xmath72 , @xmath103 , and the orbital inclination @xmath43 to be free parameters .",
    "first we optimize free parameters for each light curve , using the amoeba algorithm @xcite .",
    "the penalty function is also given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : chisq ] ) , where @xmath104 is a combination of the baseline model and the analytic transit formula mentioned above . then if the reduced @xmath105 is larger than unity , we rescale the photometric errors of the data such that the reduced @xmath105 for each light curve becomes unity .",
    "we also estimate the level of time - correlated noise for each light curve , and further rescale the errors by multiplying @xmath69 factors listed in table  [ table : ground ] .",
    "finally , we use the mcmc method @xcite to evaluate values and uncertainties of the free parameters . for the flwo , trappist , and",
    "nites light curves , we fit each light curve independently .",
    "we create 5 chains of 10@xmath106 points for each light curve , and discard the first 10@xmath107 points from each chain ( the `` burn - in '' phase ) .",
    "the jump sizes are adjusted such that the acceptance ratios are 2030% . for the oao / muscat light curves ,",
    "we fit the 3-band data simultaneously , requiring consistency in the parameters @xmath100 , @xmath43 , and @xmath103 .",

    "the baseline corrected transit light curves are plotted in figure  [ lcflwo ] ( flwo ) , figure  [ lctrni ] ( trappist and nites ) , and figure  [ lcmuscat ] ( oao ) .",
    "since k2 - 19b and k2 - 19c are close to the 3:2 mmr , it is not surprising that large ttvs have been observed in this system . to explain the observed mid - transit times , we adopt the analytic formulae of ttv by @xcite and @xcite , who considered the synodic chopping effect .",
    "successful modeling of the synodic chopping effect enables us to estimate the mass of a perturbing body .",
    "in particular the resulting mass determination is not subject to the mass - eccentricity degeneracy that was discussed by @xcite , who derived analytic formulae for a pair of planets near a first - order mmr .",
    "although the chopping analytic formulae are only applicable to systems with nearly circular and coplanar orbits , those requirements are likely fulfilled in this case , given the presence of mutual transits and the requirement for long - term dynamical stability .",
    "the chopping formulae predict the ttvs of the inner and outer planets as follows : @xmath109 where @xmath110 are the planet - to - star mass ratio ( @xmath111 ) respectively , and @xmath112 note that @xmath113 and @xmath110 are defined as non - negative variables . the parameters @xmath114 , @xmath69 , and @xmath115 are defined as , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the semi - major axes and the mean motions of the planets .",
    "those parameters can be expressed by the periods of the planets : @xmath121 ( using kepler s third law and neglecting the planet masses in comparison to the stellar mass ) , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "note that @xmath124 represents kronecker s delta , which is 1 when @xmath125 and 0 for @xmath126 .",
    "when the time of conjunction ( @xmath127 ) is used as the origin of the time scale , the phase @xmath128 can be expressed simply as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the synodic period .",
    "for the current system , we derive @xmath131 bjd@xmath132 from one of the mutual transit events , assuming that both planets are orbiting in the same direction .",
    "consequently , the observed mid - transit times ( @xmath66 ) for the planets can be modeled by 6 free parameters @xmath133 , @xmath113 , and @xmath110 as : @xmath134 where @xmath135 are the transit epochs of the planets with the origins at the first k2 transits .",
    "we first try to find an optimal parameter set for the 6 parameters ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) by minimizing @xmath142 using the amoeba algorithm . in evaluating equations  ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we truncate the series at @xmath143 to reduce the computational cost .",
    "we model the observed the mid - transit times for both planets listed in table  [ table : k2tc ] and [ table : ground ] ( 21 in total ) using the equations above .",
    "however , we find that the amoeba algorithm does not converge .",
    "note that we have tested the effects of including higher orders of @xmath144 in the calculation , but the result remains unchanged .",
    "apparently there are multiple local minima of @xmath105 in the parameter space , which are almost equally favored .",
    "this result is quite understandable : we have not observed any additional transits of planet c since the end of the k2 campaign , and hence the ttvs of planet c are poorly constrained .",
    "for this reason , we decide to fit only the mid - transit times of the inner planet ( 14 in total ) using the corresponding 4 parameters ( @xmath145 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath141 ) .",
    "this time the amoeba algorithm converges .",
    "table  [ table : ttv ] summarizes the optimal parameters and figure  [ ttvplot ] plots the optimal model explaining the observed ttvs of the inner planet .",
    "we note that we find a somewhat large reduced @xmath105 , namely @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this may indicate that the uncertainties in @xmath100 , particularly those based on k2 data , have been underestimated by a factor of about 2.1 . to account for possible systematic errors ,",
    "the uncertainties given in table  [ table : ttv ] have been enlarged by a factor of @xmath148 from the original 1@xmath50 errors estimated by the usual criterion @xmath149 .",
    "we then check on the existence of possible local minima of @xmath105 by fixing @xmath150 close to the optimal value and optimizing the other parameters using the amoeba algorithm .",
    "we repeat this exercise for values of @xmath150 ranging from 11.5 to 12.5 .",
    "figure  [ ttvsystematic ] shows the variation in @xmath105 and the optimal parameters with changing @xmath150 .",
    "we find that the second - minimum @xmath105 is located at @xmath151 days with @xmath152 from the minimum @xmath105 .",
    "figure  [ ttvplot2 ] presents a ttv model for the second - minimum @xmath105 .",
    "the behavior of the second - minimum @xmath105 model is almost identical to the minimum @xmath105 model in the observing period .",
    "thus we can not exclude this solution statistically at this point .",
    "therefore , table  [ table : ttv ] also gives the parameters and errors based on the second - minimum @xmath105 solution .",
    "we also note that the third - minimum @xmath105 is located at @xmath153 days with @xmath154 , which is statistically less favorable than the above two solutions .",
    "as seen in figure  [ ttvsystematic ] , the orbital period for the inner planet @xmath155 is robustly determined to be about 7.921 days .",
    "the minimum and second - minimum @xmath105 are thus located slightly above ( @xmath156 ) and below ( @xmath157 ) the exact 3:2 commensurability ( @xmath158 days ) .",
    "the orbital period of the outer planet is not permitted to lie exactly on the commensurability , where larger ttvs are predicted and the synodic chopping formulae are less reliable .",
    "this is why the optimization results in the mass of the planet c being driven to zero when @xmath150 is held fixed near the 3:2 commensurability . the planet - to - star mass ratio for the outer planet @xmath141",
    "is estimated as @xmath159 for the minimum @xmath105 solution and @xmath160 for the second - minimum . according to the mass of the host star presented in table  [ table : hds ]",
    ", these values correspond to a mass for planet  c of @xmath161 and @xmath162 for the minimum and second - minimum solutions , respectively .",
    "thus the mass of the outer planet is well constrained to be @xmath163 .",
    "we note that the error of @xmath164 has less impact on the above results .",
    "finally , we present coefficients of the synodic chopping formulae in table  [ table : ttv ] so as to facilitate transit predictions for the inner planet in upcoming years .",
    "very recently , @xcite reported a photo - dynamical modeling of ttvs and rvs of the k2 - 19 system .",
    "they derived the mass of the planet c as @xmath165 , which is well consistent with our result .",
    "we note that the derived orbital periods of both planets are also consistent when taking account for a difference in the definitions and @xmath150 as linear coefficients for the epoch and they are decoupled from the ttv term ( see equations 8 and 9 ) , whereas @xcite defined them as parameters in the photo - dynamical modeling , which includes the ttv term ( see @xcite ) . ] of @xmath155 and @xmath150 .",
    "k2 - 19c has a relatively low mean density of @xmath166 .",
    "it is therefore likely to have a gaseous atmosphere on top of any solid component ( see also figure [ fig_mr ] ) .",
    "we explore models for the interior structure of k2 - 19c ( @xmath167 , @xmath168 at 0.1024au ) based on the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium , using equations of state ( eos ) for four constituents : scvh eos for h / he @xcite ; the _ ab initio _",
    "eos @xcite and the sesame eos 7150 @xcite for water ; and the sesame eos 7100 and 2140 for rocky material and iron , respectively .",
    "we calculate a pressure - temperature profile of an irradiated planet s atmosphere in radiative equilibrium , using the analytical formulae of and gas opacities derived by @xcite .",
    "we assume that both the incoming and outgoing radiation fields are isotropic , the bond albedo of the planet is zero , and the incoming flux is averaged over the dayside hemisphere .",
    "the atmospheric mass fraction of k2 - 19c is estimated to be @xmath169 for a earth - like core model ( 32.5% iron core , 67.5% silicate mantle ) and @xmath170 for an icy core model ( ice : rock = 2.7 : 1 ) , where we assumed that k2 - 19c has a h / he atmosphere with the stellar metallicity of [ fe / h ] = 0.07 .",
    "we find that k2 - 19c likely has a h / he atmosphere of @xmath171wt% despite the fact that its total mass exceeds the critical core mass for gas accretion within the protoplanetary disk , which is thought to be @xmath172 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the atmospheric removal of k2 - 19c via giant impacts and/or a mass loss driven by stellar irradiation might have occurred .",
    "the mass of k2 - 19b remains undetermined .",
    "here , we discuss the possible mass range of k2 - 19b ( @xmath173 at 0.0823au ) from a standpoint of the formation and evolution of close - in planets . under the extreme assumption that k2 - 19b has no gaseous atmosphere and is purely solid , its observed radius would require its mass to be @xmath174 .",
    "the formation of such a massive solid core without any gaseous envelope seems unlikely .",
    "such a massive core would be theoretically expected to initiate the ( _ in - situ _ ) accretion of the ambient disk gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a core of this mass has been inferred for hd  149026b @xcite , but in that case the core is accompanied by a substantial gaseous atmosphere . consequently , for k2 - 19b , it seems most plausible to consider models that possess an atmosphere .",
    "however , we note that k2 - 19b , orbiting at only @xmath175au , may have undergone atmospheric loss due to stellar irradiation .",
    "as the age of k2 - 19 is relatively old ( @xmath176 gyr ) , a neptune - mass planet could have lost a substantial amount of its atmosphere , whereas a jupiter - mass planet would likely have retained its original atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with these considerations in mind ,",
    "we consider two models that k2 - 19b is a neptune - like planet ( @xmath177wt% of a h / he atmosphere ) or a gas giant .",
    "we first suppose that k2 - 19b has a h / he atmosphere of @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 on top of a solid core . the atmosphere is taken to have the same metallicity as the host star , and the core",
    "is taken to have an earth - like composition . under these assumptions",
    ", the mass of k2 - 19b is expected to be @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "second , we suppose that k2 - 19b has a mass of @xmath184 . in this case",
    "the models indicate that the atmospheric mass fraction is @xmath185 .",
    "accordingly , k2 - 19b can be a sub - neptune - mass planet with a tenuous atmosphere , a super - neptune planet , or a close - in gas giant with an extremely massive solid core .",
    "recently , @xcite derived the mass of k2 - 19b as @xmath186 m@xmath12 , from photo - dynamical modeling .",
    "their result supports that k2 - 19b would be surrounded by a thick h / he atmosphere of @xmath187 .",
    "the k2 - 19 system is the first discovery of close - in neptune - sized planets near a 3:2 mmr .",
    "a slow convergent migration allows low - mass planets to be locked into a first - order commensurability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , figure [ fig_mmr ] shows that all of the other pairs of planets close to the 3:2 commensurability found by kepler are smaller than @xmath188 . also , planets with @xmath189 days near a 2:1 mmr have radii smaller than about @xmath188 .",
    "the peculiar pair close to the 3:2 mmr around k2 - 19 is suggestive of inward transport of neptune - sized planets through a convergent migration .",
    "we find there is a lack of close - in gas giants among both 3:2 mmr and 2:1 mmr systems .",
    "besides , 3:2 mmr systems seem to be less common than 2:1 mmr ones . dynamical instability of more closely - packed 3:2 mmr systems may be responsible for the feature .",
    "in addition , there is no gas giant in a 3:2 mmr so far discovered within @xmath190 days . for 2:1 mmr systems , gas giants such as kepler-9b , 9c @xcite , and kepler-30c @xcite form the 2:1 commensurability beyond @xmath191 days .",
    "the distinct habitat may imply that large planets with radius of @xmath192 most likely fall into a 2:1 mmr rather than a 3:2 mmr due to the strength of planetary migration .",
    "an outer planet formed in a 2:1 mmr or 3:2 mmr tends to be larger than an inner one ( see figure [ fig_mmr ] ) .",
    "this may imply that an outer planet caught up with an inner one to form a first - order mmr system in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "the inner planet closer to the central star loses its atmosphere more readily via stellar x - ray and uv ( xuv ) irradiation .",
    "the strength of the stellar xuv flux that a pair of planets in a @xmath193 mmr receives is related as @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the commensurability integer and @xmath196 is the stellar xuv flux . the subtle but non - negligible flux difference may lead to the prevalence of larger outer planets in a 2:1 mmr or a 3:2 mmr .",
    "however , the radius of k2 - 19b is about 1.68 times as large as that of the neptune - sized k2 - 19c .",
    "this means that the k2 - 19 system has a unique 3:2 mmr configuration , compared to other close - in mmr systems with smaller planets .",
    "the mass determination of k2 - 19b should be a crucial role of understanding what causes their radius contrast , and why the close - in super - neptune and neptune pair was trapped into a 3:2 mmr rather than a 2:1 mmr , for example , the difference in migration speed @xcite .",
    "we have conducted high - dispersion spectroscopy , ao imaging , and ground - based transit follow - up observations to characterize the k2 - 19 planetary system .",
    "we have estimated parameters of the host star with an order of magnitude higher precision than previous studies by the subaru / hds spectroscopy . through the subaru / hiciao imaging",
    ", we have excluded the presence of contaminating faint objects which can dilute or mimic transits of the two planets .",
    "we have obtained new ground - based transit light curves using the flwo 1.2 m telescope , trappist 0.6 m telescope , and oao 1.88 m telescope . combined with the k2 transit light curves , we have modeled observed ttv for the inner planet using the synodic chopping formulae given by @xcite .",
    "we have found two statistically indistinguishable solutions for ttv , located slightly above and below the exact 3:2 mmr . despite the degeneracy",
    ", both solutions consistently estimate the orbital period of the inner planet @xmath197 days and the mass of the outer planet @xmath198 .    to break the degeneracy of the ttv solutions , further ground - based transit follow - up observations as well as precise radial - velocity measurements are strongly desired .",
    "we particularly emphasize the importance of transit observations for the outer planet , which will allow us to characterize the ttv of the outer planet in detail and thereby enable us to estimate the mass of the inner planet precisely .",
    "given the nearly - equatorial location of k2 - 19 in the sky ( ra : 11:39:50.477 , dec : + 00:36:12.87 , @xcite ) , the k2 - 19 system is observable from both the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "this will facilitate intensive follow - up observations , which would be quite fruitful in the upcoming seasons .",
    "a precise estimate of the mass of the inner planet will allow us to estimate the amount of a h / he atmosphere , for which we have presented theoretical predictions based on different internal compositions .",
    "the nature and the amount of the h / he atmosphere for the inner planet can be further characterized by transmission spectroscopy .",
    "since the inner planet is a rare case of a super - neptune , such a characterization of the atmosphere would be also interesting as future work .",
