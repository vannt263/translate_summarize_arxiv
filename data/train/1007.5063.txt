    "perhaps the most spectacular discovery of the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ was the detection around a small handful of normal main - sequence stars of excess infrared ( ir ) radiation from remnant disks now understood to represent debris related to planet formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these disks are largely dissipated in in a few hundred myr by collisional degradation of larger bodies combined with poynting - robertson ( pr ) and stellar wind drag , radiation pressure and evaporation @xcite .",
    "recent _ spitzer _",
    "surveys at 70  @xmath0 m find a disk fraction of @xmath1%  for f , g and k stars with ages up to 3  gyr or so @xcite .",
    "one other group of stars with ir excesses has remained inconspicuous .",
    "the rs  cvn class of tidally - interacting close binaries , in which at least one component has generally reached the sub - giant evolutionary phase @xcite , were discovered by iras to have an ir excess occurrence rate of about 40% twice as high as main - sequence stars and 34 times higher than giants ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the observed excesses typically amounted to several percent of the stellar bolometric luminosity and corresponded to a blackbody temperature of order 1500  k. within current scenarios explaining ir excesses around late type stars , rs  cvns should not have any : they represent a significantly older population than the few 100  myr dusty disk lifetime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and have not undergone any evolutionary phase during which substantial mass loss and dust formation is expected . despite this puzzle , the ir excess rs  cvns have received scant attention since their initial discovery .",
    "more recently , @xcite found bd  + 20  307 , `` the dustiest known main - sequence star '' @xcite , to be a close spectroscopic binary with a period of 3.4 days and estimated its age to be greater than 1  gyr .",
    "the parallel between the 3.4 day binary bd  + 20  307 and the ir excess rs  cvns  spectroscopic binaries with periods of a few days  is striking .",
    "the dust emission of bd  + 20  307 amounts to an unusually large 4% of its bolometric luminosity , and has an unusually high temperature of @xmath2  k @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest the warm dust in bd  + 20  307 likely arises from recent pulverising collisions between planets or planetesimals . that such close binaries can harbor planetary systems",
    "has been demonstrated by the planet around hw  vir ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we present a _ spitzer _",
    "photometric survey of a small sample of 10 rs  cvns to probe deeper into the purported ir excesses of this class .",
    "the data presented in this paper were obtained by the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite as part of the general observing program pid 20713 . _ infrared array camera _",
    "( irac ; @xcite ) observations were made in high dynamic range mode between 2005 jul and dec .",
    "targets were observed in 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath0 m bands for 12s in each position of a 12 point reuleaux pattern dither map , for a total effective integration time of 124.8s .",
    "_ multiband imaging photometer",
    "_ ( mips ; @xcite ) observations were obtained in the 24 , 70 and 160  @xmath0 m bands in photometry mode between 2005 nov and 2007 jan , with an exposure time of 10s , repeated for 2 cycles ( 24@xmath3 m ) or 3 cycles ( 70 and 160  @xmath3 m ) . reduced image mosaics were produced with the iracproc custom software @xcite , while for mips we used the spitzer science center pipeline mosaics .",
    "these were analysed using standard aperture ( mips ) and point spread function ( psf ) based ( irac ) photometry , the latter adopting the procedure described in @xcite , that enable deriving the flux of core - saturated sources .",
    "all photometry results are reported in table  [ t : photo ] .",
    "only one source ( ux ari ) was detected at @xmath4 at @xmath5 .",
    "for two other sources ( cf tuc and ii peg ) we found @xmath6 level signals .",
    "for all other sources we report @xmath7 upper limits .",
    "the well known mips 160 micron near - ir spectral leak prevented us from using data taken in this band .",
    "our analysis procedure was similar to that followed by @xcite and involved comparison of stellar model fluxes , fitted to observed optical and near - ir photometry , with the _ spitzer _ ir photometry .",
    "for each binary listed in table  [ t : photo ] , we modelled _ bvrijhk _ photometry culled from literature with a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) model comprising the sum of two kurucz photospheric models ( one for each stellar component in the case of double - lined spectroscopic binaries , weighted by stellar radius and effective temperature according to @xmath8 ) . since surface spots resulting from magnetic activity on rs  cvns can give rise to detectable secular photometric changes ( thus leading to some having been designated as variables ) , we adopted photometric uncertainties that generally encompassed observed ranges of variations for each star . for dwarfs stars , we adopted the effective temperature  radius relation of @xcite with initial values for effective temperature from the literature ; for more evolved components we culled values for temperature , radius and/or mass and surface gravity from the literature . final radius and effective temperature model parameters for each system were honed by exploring the grid of kurucz models using a @xmath9 minimisation .",
    "final stellar parameters are listed in table  [ t : fit ] .",
    "comparison of adopted kurucz models with _ spitzer _",
    "photometry revealed satisfactory fits for all but the three sources : ar  psc , ii  peg and ux  ari . for these systems , no combination of kurucz photospheres could reproduce the measured irac and mips fluxes : in all three cases , the observed ir fluxes were too high compared to the predicted model fluxes . including a blackbody as an additional component ,",
    "fitting the temperature and normalization as free parameters ( see table  [ t : fit ] ) , greatly improved the sed model fits .",
    "results are illustrated in figure  [ f : seds ] ) , together with iras faint source catalog v2.0 @xmath10 fluxes . in agreement with earlier studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "the best - fit blackbody temperatures lie in the range 1300 - 1900  k with an uncertainty of 200300  k. the low - level 70  @xmath11 emission in ii peg is consistent with the long wavelength tail of the hot blackbody excess , while that for ux  ari hints at the possible presence of additional cold dust . for other binaries that do not show a detectable ir excess ,",
    "we have estimated @xmath12 upper limits . assuming a nominal blackbody temperature of 1500  k",
    ", we find that for these systems the blackbody luminosity must be less than @xmath13% of the bolometric luminosity ( see table  [ t : photo ] ) .",
    "to estimate more realistic dust temperatures , non - blackbody circumstellar dust with an emissivity law of the type @xmath14 , where @xmath15 corresponds approximately to the grain size and @xmath16 is a parameter of order unity , depending on grain type , as described by , e.g. , @xcite were used . in general , fits using a grain emissivity law ( table  [ t : fit ] ) required lower temperatures . for both ii  peg and ar  psc ,",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are @xmath17 m and 1 respectively , whereas for ux  ari these parameters were not well - constrained by the data .",
    "we note two systems in table  [ t : photo ] for which we find no significant excess at levels below earlier iras - based detections ; either the earlier detections were spurious , or the excesses have waned in the intervening years .",
    "the span from 3.624  @xmath0 m covered by our _ spitzer _ irac and mips photometry is very effective for diagnosing the presence of warm and even hot dust .",
    "the requirement for a purely stellar sed is that the ir photometric indices lie along the rayleigh - jeans tail of the photospheric ir ( essentially blackbody ) continuum .",
    "the seds illustrated in figure  [ f : seds ] fail to do this in the sense that the observed slope is incorrect : the departure from stellar seds increases toward longer wavelengths . from the blackbody fits , we have determined the fraction of the stellar bolometric luminosities reprocessed into ir emission and list these in table  [ t : photo ] : we find values ranging from 0.7 to 1.9% .",
    "our detection of ir excess in the spectrum of ii  peg confirms the earlier photometric detection by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) and the preliminary _ isophot _ spectrum obtained by @xcite . of our other two detections ,",
    "ux  ari was found to have a substantial near - ir excess in @xmath18 photometry by @xcite but was not found to have a significant excess in iras photometry by @xcite .",
    "ar  psc instead represents a new ir excess detection . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the observed ir excesses can not be fitted with a standard free - free emission spectrum from , e.g. , an ionized wind , whose @xmath19 frequency dependence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is much too flat .",
    "moreover , the observed fluxes would imply mass loss rates of order @xmath20  @xmath21  yr@xmath22orders of magnitude higher than expected for these stars . @xcite and",
    "@xcite interpreted the observed excesses in terms of dust shells .",
    "while the implied dust temperatures are high in the context of dust in debris disks , we emphasise that unresolved low - mass stars or brown dwarfs can not explain the excesses because typical luminosities of these objects for the required temperatures are @xmath23 @xcite which is more than an order of magnitude lower than observed .    @xcite and @xcite suggested the dust arises from the accumulation of stellar winds driven by magnetic activity .",
    "however , in order to reach temperatures of @xmath24  k , dust must reside close to the central stars at typical distances of @xmath25  au .",
    "dust in such a location is short - lived and any grains that form will be rapidly dissipated by pr drag .",
    "@xcite estimate the lifetimes of larger grains of a few @xmath0 m in size around bd  + 20  307 to be only a few decades .",
    "minimum dust masses able to explain the excesses of ii  peg , ar  psc and ux  ari are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28  @xmath21 , respectively ; a standard gas : dust ratio implies total masses 100 times higher .",
    "@xcite found very active stars might lose mass at rates perhaps up to @xmath29  yr@xmath22 ( 100 times that of the sun ) , meaning 10 - 100 years of accumulated wind would be necessary to explain the dust .",
    "it seems highly unlikely that such fully - ionized , magnetically - driven winds and coronal mass ejections with outflow velocities of several hundred km  s@xmath22 would accumulate in this way .",
    "we are lead to the suggestion of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) that such warm dust originates from collisions between planetary bodies .",
    "since grains produced in this way will be dissipated relatively quickly , such collision events must be recent .",
    "the problem , then , is why stars of such ages as the rs  cvn - type binaries should be producing dust when debris disks around single stars and wide binaries are largely dissipated in a few hundred myr . in the case of bd+20  307 , @xcite noted possible systemic radial velocity variations and suggested an unseen brown dwarf or low - mass star could have destabilized the orbits of rocky bodies .",
    "such destabilization , occurring many millions of years after a `` first generation '' debris disk would have been mostly dissipated , could stimulate new dust production in gyr old systems , reviving whatever debris disk remains around these stars .",
    "we suggest another possible mechanism resulting from the conspicuous property of tidally - interacting binaries not shared by their non - interacting single and binary brethren of similar age : copious magnetic activity manifest in the form of high levels of surface spots , chromospheric and x - ray emission .",
    "such activity is thought responsible for the rotational braking through angular momentum loss of main - sequence stars from zero - age onwards ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "angular momentum loss of the dwarf precursors to rs  cvns , such as bd+20  307 , as well as the more x - ray bright rs  cvns themselves , results in substantial orbital shrinkage ( e.g. by factors of up to 2 or more ) through spin - orbit tidal coupling on timescales of hundreds of myr to a gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this change in the orbit causes proportional changes in the locations of both mean motion resonances and secular resonances in whatever planetary system the binary has .",
    "we postulate that the sweeping of these resonances can lead to both destabilization of the orbits of small bodies and resonant capture ; both of these processes can increase the collision rate among these bodies .",
    "this mechanism would provide a more general means of stimulating new eras of copious dust production and debris disk revival in gyr old systems without the need to invoke perturbations from additional companions .",
    "one potential problem for a collisional origin of the dust is the high frequency of detection40%  according to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our pilot study sample is partially biased toward systems with previously identified excesses .",
    "if our non - detection of excesses in cf  tuc and wy  cnc imply earlier detections were spurious , the excess frequency implied by this and our detection of one excess in five objects not previously studied is @xmath30% .",
    "an evolutionary timescale of 1  gyr then implies an integrated warm dust production period  whether in a single or multiple episodes  of 200  myr .",
    "for a 100  yr dissipation timescale of @xmath31  @xmath21 of dust , the total mass required is @xmath32  @xmath21 or about 1 earth mass , consistent with a planetary origin .      to examine the interaction between a close binary star and a debris disk we ran a numerical model (",
    "see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of a dust cloud around ii  peg using the dust properties consistent from our _ spitzer _ photometry . ii  peg was chosen because it is the best studied of the three systems for which we detect ir excesses : we assumed masses of 1.67 and @xmath33 , a semi - major axis of 0.087  au , eccentricity of 0.0 , and total luminosity of @xmath34 based on the stellar parameters reported by @xcite and @xcite .    for this initial model ,",
    "we focus on dynamical clearing and neglect grain - grain collisions , which can also alter the disk morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "dust was released from 1  au with initial eccentricities and inclinations uniformly distributed over the ranges 00.1 and 00.05 , respectively , with the rest of the orbital elements uniformly distributed over 0@xmath35 .",
    "we numerically integrated the orbits of 620 dust grains , subject to gravity from the stars , radiation pressure , and pr drag , until the particles either collided with one of the stars or was ejected beyond 4  au .",
    "another parameter in these models is @xmath36 , the radiation pressure force on the grain divided by the gravitational force . in the vicinity of a star with the luminosity of ii  peg , a 3@xmath3 m radius silicate sphere consistent with our models for",
    "the photometry corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "we chose this value , and neglected the slight radiation pressure from the faint secondary star ; we leave this detail for future models . at regular time intervals",
    ", we accumulated the particle positions in a histogram , in the manner of many previous authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this histogram models the steady - state surface density of the cloud , which is illustrated in figure  [ f : nummod ] .",
    "figure  [ f : nummod ] shows a disk with a central clearing , centered on the barycenter of the binary .",
    "white dots indicate the locations of the two stars .",
    "the dust surface density distribution is azimuthally symmetric , consistent with the analytic predictions of @xcite .",
    "there are 23 ring - like density enhancements , which might be artifacts of the narrow particle size distribution in these initial models , but no signs of clumps or spiral features . for interpreting the _ spitzer _ data , the most important result is the size of the central clearing .",
    "the radius of this clearing in the dynamical model is 0.22  au and similar to the radius at which first order mean motion resonances overlap ( and actually coincident with the 4:1 mean motion resonance ) .",
    "this is consistent with our models for the spectral energy distribution for which the grain emissivity law temperature implies a radius @xmath38  au .",
    "a dust sublimation temperature of 1700  k implies that the dust can survive at 0.22  au , and that the clearing radius is determined by the system dynamics , rather than grain evaporation .    in section  [ s : obsanal ] , we noted that iras excesses for two systems in our _ spitzer _ sample are not confirmed .",
    "the poynting - robertson time for 3  @xmath0 m grains is @xcite @xmath39  yr . for the grains in the ii  peg model , @xmath40 , and the pr time is 177 years .",
    "but if the grains are launched near the star at 0.3 au instead of 1  au , the pr time drops to 16 years  sufficiently short for iras epoch dust to have dissipated by the time _",
    "observations were made .",
    "either the earlier detections were spurious , or excesses could have waned , suggestive of dust being produced in a succession of discrete events .",
    "a _ spitzer _ survey of ten tidally - interacting binary systems finds ir excesses for three .",
    "the excesses are consistent with significant amounts of warm dust close to the central stars .",
    "a numerical model for the steady - state distribution of dust in ii  peg finds a clearing radius of 0.22  au , consistent with the observed optical - ir sed , and suggests the warm dust temperatures result from inward migration of dust due to pr drag and central clearing caused by dynamical perturbations .    reported iras excesses for cf  tuc and wy  cnc are not confirmed by _ spitzer _ , indicating a possible waning of dust in the last few decades .",
    "this is consistent with pr drag , for which we find the timescale for dust depletion around ii  peg could be as short as a decade or so , suggesting ongoing dust production .",
    "we echo the suggestion of @xcite that dust could arise from collisions of planetary bodies , and speculate that these old binaries can enter epochs in which they destabilize the orbits of their planets through shrinkage of their own binary orbit due to magnetically - driven angular momentum loss .",
