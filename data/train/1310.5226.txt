    "manipulating a quantum system by an external field to achieve a given task remains a primary goal of various areas @xcite extending from atomic and molecular physics @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , quantum computing @xcite to solid state physics .",
    "one of the most general and versatile procedures to tackle such control problems is optimal control theory @xcite .",
    "this technique designs a field able to bring the quantum system to the target state while maximizing or minimizing a given cost functional .    in our setting ,",
    "an optimal control problem can be treated by two different types of approaches , geometric @xcite and numerical methods @xcite for quantum systems of low and high dimension , respectively .",
    "in addition to the problem of steering the density operator of the system to the target state , the creation of desired unitary operators plays a key role in both spectroscopy and quantum information processing .",
    "various approaches to construct a desired unitary transformation has been proposed .",
    "one of them is based on the combination of simple pulses according to general symmetry principles @xcite but the control fields constructed with this method generally present the drawback of having long durations .",
    "time - optimal solutions can be determined using numerical optimal control methods @xcite as well as using geometrical principles @xcite .",
    "note that related problems can also be solved by the use of lie group techniques @xcite .",
    "this work will use geometric principles to address one of the basic and fundamental question in quantum computation : the optimal control of a single - qubit gate . up to now",
    ", this well - known control problem has been the subject of a series of works both in mathematics @xcite and in physics @xcite , to cite a few . here",
    ", we propose to revisit this question by giving an explicit coordinate - parametrization of the optimal trajectories .",
    "this leads to a complete , analytical and straightforward resolution of the control problem .",
    "we will also discuss the influence of a detuning term on the optimal pulse sequence .",
    "here we consider a spin-@xmath0 particle interacting with a constant magnetic field @xmath1 along the @xmath2-direction .",
    "the control of the spin is performed through the variation of an external transverse magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "we place ourselves in the framework of the rotating wave approximation , for which @xmath4 and the frequency of the transverse magnetic field is close to the larmor frequency of the spin @xcite .    to simplify the discussion , we consider in this paper only gates on su(2 ) and not on u(2 ) .",
    "we recall that the elements of su(2 ) are the matrices of u(2 ) with determinant equal to one , i.e. the elements for which a global phase factor has been removed .",
    "the formalism introduced below can be straightforwardly extended to the unitary group u(2 ) . for a given target state belonging to su(2 ) , we determine the control fields which minimize the total time of the process by applying the pontryagin maximum principle .",
    "note that a similar control problem has been recently treated in ref .",
    "@xcite in which a different parameterization of the optimal trajectories has been used .",
    "our work complements this first study by addressing related questions such as the optimization on so(3 ) as well as the computation of trajectories when a detuning term is taken into account .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec2 ] and the different choices of coordinates to parametrize su(2 ) are discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we show how to apply the pontryagin maximum principle to this quantum system .",
    "sections [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] are devoted to the computation of the optimal trajectories with and without detuning .",
    "special attention is paid to two specific examples , the rotations about the @xmath2- axis and the rotations about axes in the ( @xmath5)- plane .",
    "explicit optimal solutions are given for these two quantum operations .",
    "conclusion and prospective views are given in sec .",
    "finally , some technical computations are reported in appendix [ app ] .",
    "this section is dedicated to presenting the general problem studied throughout the paper . after introducing the system under concern",
    ", we will describe the problem mathematically and translate it in different coordinate systems in order to get several points of view , which will be used in the analysis of the optimal control problem .",
    "we consider a one spin-@xmath0 closed system on which a constant magnetic field @xmath6 aligned in the @xmath2-direction is applied .",
    "in addition , the system can be acted upon by a controlled transverse magnetic field @xmath7 of bounded strength @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , we assume that @xmath8 is much smaller than @xmath9 and that this field oscillates at a frequency close to the larmor frequency of the spin . under this hypothesis",
    ", we can place ourselves in a given rotating frame and use the rotating wave approximation in order to simplify the description of the problem . in this framework",
    ", the time - dependant quantum hamiltonian of the system takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the control fields , which satisfy @xmath13 .",
    "the constant @xmath14 is the _ detuning _ term and corresponds ( up to a constant factor ) to the frequency difference between the frequency of the control field @xmath3 and the larmor frequency . in particular , @xmath14 is zero in the resonant case where the two frequencies are equal .",
    "the @xmath15 s denote the pauli matrices . in order to treat the problem in its most general context",
    ", we will rather work with the normalized variables @xmath16 where @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 for @xmath19 $ ] ( @xmath20 being the control duration ) and @xmath21 .",
    "such a transformation corresponds to a renormalization of the time by @xmath22 , but by an abuse of notation we keep @xmath23 instead of @xmath24 in the remaining of the text .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian of the system now takes the form : @xmath25    the angular part of @xmath26 will be denoted @xmath27 such that @xmath28 @xmath29 being the amplitude of the control field . note that the time dependance of most of the dynamical variables will be dropped throughout the paper in order to simplify the notation .    writing the state of the system at time @xmath23 in the density matrix formalism , @xmath30 ,",

    "note that @xmath36 belongs to @xmath37 and not u@xmath38 because the quantum hamiltonian @xmath39 is an element of the lie algebra @xmath40 .",
    "the question of controlling the quantum system from a given initial state @xmath41 can then be translated to a control problem on @xmath37 , which is exactly the objective of this paper .",
    "more precisely , one investigates the problem of finding the optimal control @xmath42 ( the sign @xmath43 will indicate the optimal solutions in the rest of the paper ) steering the system from the identity matrix @xmath44 to a target state @xmath45 while minimizing the time @xmath20 to get there .",
    "we will use the simplified notation @xmath46 .",
    "the dynamics governing the system for this _ time - optimal _ control problem is given by the schrdinger equation @xmath47      let us recall some characteristics of the group @xmath37 we are going to work with .",

    "however , since @xmath50 , the @xmath56 s satisfy the relation @xmath63 and the quaternion parametrization uses one parameter more than needed .",
    "this remark partly motivates our choice of instead considering the so - called hopf parametrization . in term of the hopf variables",
    "@xmath64 , @xmath54 can be written as @xmath65 where the domain of definition will be defined below .",
    "the main advantage of the hopf parametrization is that eq .",
    "translates nicely in its variables , which give the simple form @xmath66 where the normalized `` rotated '' controls @xmath67 have been used and satisfy @xmath68 .",
    "the explicit calculations for obtaining equations eq .   can be found in appendix  [ app0 ] .",
    "the control problem reads now as follows : _ given a target state @xmath69 , find the control @xmath70 steering @xmath71 while minimizing the control duration @xmath72 . _",
    "+ note that the condition @xmath73 translates in terms of hopf variables as @xmath74    in later parts of this paper , we will also make use of the euler parametrization @xmath75 which will allow us to easily visualize the rotations .",
    "the euler variables are related to the hopf coordinates by @xmath76 recalling the close relate between elements of @xmath37 and rotations @xmath77 , in terms of euler coordinates , unitary matrices are given by @xmath78 .",

    "the domains of the @xmath82 variables can then be deduced directly from eqs .  .",
    "the problem of finding the time - optimal control for steering the system from an initial state to a fixed target can be decomposed into three steps , each of which brings its own considerations and particular methodology .",
    "firstly , one must find the optimal candidates for the control functions . here , we can have two types of controls , either regular or singular type .",
    "the second step consists in computing the trajectories associated with the different controls . finally , one has to determine the right trajectory which reaches the desired target state . while the two first steps are treated through the pontryagin maximum principle ( pmp ) @xcite , depending on the optimal problem considered the last step may require numerical methods .",
    "the present section is intended to expose the main features of the pmp and to apply it to our particular problem .",
    "this section aims at presenting the elements of the theory of pmp used to solve our control problem . in order to be as pedagogical as possible ,",
    "the general equations arising from the theory @xcite will be followed by their translation in our particular context .",
    "consider a controlled system @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 for @xmath86 $ ] where @xmath87 as before .",
    "let @xmath88 denotes the trajectory associated to the control @xmath89 .",
    "given two points @xmath90 , one aims at finding @xmath89 such that @xmath91 , @xmath92 and minimizing ( or eventually optimizing ) the cost functionnal @xmath93 the function @xmath94 is the running cost which depends on the whole trajectory @xmath88 whereas @xmath95 is the final cost which depends only on the final time and state .",
    "hamiltonian _ of the system driven by @xmath89 is also called pmp _ pseudo - hamiltonian _ and is denoted @xmath96 the term @xmath97 denotes the scalar product between the state vector @xmath98 and a vector @xmath99 called the _ adjoint state _ , which is required to be continuous all along an optimal trajectory .",
    "the constant @xmath100 is taken to be negative ( for a maximum principle ) and should be such that @xmath100 and @xmath101 never simultaneously vanish .",
    "note that the overall vector @xmath102 is defined up to a positive constant factor .    at this stage , we express our problem in this formalism .",
    ".   corresponds to our system given in eq .   with @xmath103 .",
    "the norm of the controls @xmath104 are bounded to @xmath105 . since the goal is to minimize the control time",
    ", the cost function is @xmath106 and one can consider @xmath107 and @xmath108 in eq .  .",
    "finally , after factorizing the two control components , the pmp pseudo - hamiltonian takes the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "the pmp suggests that a _ necessary _",

    "such controls , which are well defined when @xmath121 only , are said to be _ normal _ and the associated trajectories @xmath122 are called _",
    "regular_. when @xmath123 , computational analysis ( detailed below ) reveals that the controls , said to be _ singular _ , must vanish .",
    "the associated trajectories are also called _ singular _ and are non - trivial only when @xmath124 . however , for both @xmath125 and @xmath126 , we can show that singular trajectories as well as mixtures of regular and singular trajectories are _ never _ optimal @xcite .",
    "in other words , the time - optimal controls for our problem are necessarily normal and consequently , we will restrict our study to these ones only .",
    "in addition , the pmp states that the final pmp hamiltonian must satisfy @xmath127 for almost all @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "equation   is called the _ transversality _ condition and takes the above form when we apply the pmp formalism to our problem for some non - fixed final time @xmath129 .",
    "equation   is derived from the fact that the pmp pseudo - hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time .",
    "note that in our case , since @xmath130 , those two relations merge into the relation @xmath131 in the following , the constant @xmath100 is normalized to -1 .",
    "finally , the pmp ensures that the dynamics along an optimal trajectory is given by the hamilton set of @xmath132 differential equations @xmath133    when normal controls are considered , this system takes the form @xmath134 where the adjoint variables have been normalized to @xmath135 , the prime has been dropped to simplify the notations and we used the constants of the motion    @xmath136    to simplify the equations .",

    "since @xmath139 , the @xmath140 term would be infinite in @xmath141 if @xmath142 , which can not be the case since the controls have finite intensity .",
    "using this condition , it is also straightforward to check that singular controls are null .",
    "the term @xmath143 is equal to zero on a given time interval only if @xmath144 .",
    "the associated singular trajectories correspond to a freely evolving system whose dynamics is governed by the detuning term @xmath145 .",
    "we recall that the case without detuning corresponds to @xmath125 .",
    "as already mentioned , the only controls to consider are the normal ones . in particular , since such controls satisfy @xmath146 , the controls are uniquely characterized ( modulo @xmath147 ) by the angular parameter @xmath148 ( see eqs .  ) . in this section",
    ", we explicitly write the solutions of the system of dynamical equations   in terms of the euler angles parametrization @xmath149 .",

    ", we get two relations between the variables @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath27 : @xmath153 since @xmath154 is constant , the first of these two equations implies that the real angular control is a linear function of the time @xmath155 we can show that @xmath156 @xcite and from this relation together with the fact that @xmath157 ( since @xmath158 ) , we directly compute @xmath159 by using the definition of @xmath160 .    equations also provide us the main tool needed to visualize the extremals as their projection on the sphere @xmath161 . indeed , given an extremal @xmath162 associated to the regular control @xmath104 for @xmath163 $ ] , let @xmath164 be the projection of this extremal on the sphere .",
