    "galaxy colours can tell us much about the stellar populations and star formation history ( sfh ) of a galaxy .",
    "of particular interest are the possible connections between the sfh and possible energetic feedback related to black hole growth . however , in order to properly interpret the measured colours of a galaxy we must understand the origins of the colours .",
    "radiation associated with an accretion disc around active galactic nuclei ( agns ) produces large amounts of blue light , causing potentially unexpected effects on the measured colours of the host galaxies",
    ".    star formation , agn feedback and possible connections between them have been discussed by several authors in recent years ( e.g.  silk & rees 1998 ; granato et al .  2004 ; hopkins et al .",

    ". we will compare the results presented here to a few specific scenarios .",
    "one such scenario described agns caused by interactions or mergers between gas - rich disc galaxies having similar masses ( hopkins et al .  2008a , 2008b ) .",
    "another explored black hole growth initiated by instabilities in isolated giant elliptical galaxies ( ciotti & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "both of these scenarios suggest timelines for various observable features , such as nuclear obscuration and the shutting down of star formation .",
    "we also compare our results to a scenario that described how feedback from low - luminosity agns may prevent additional star formation ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ) following an initial burst associated with , for example , a merger or interaction .",
    "ciotti & ostriker ( 2007 ) described simulations related to the circumstances surrounding significant growth of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) found in giant elliptical galaxies . in their simulations , gas emitted from central stars led to radiative instabilities and a collapse of metal - rich gas in the nuclear regions of the galaxy .",
    "new star formation claimed about half of the gas , and about half was ejected from the nucleus ; less than 1 per cent of the gas contributed to the growth of the central smbh .",
    "ciotti & ostriker ( 2007 ) found that both the agn and the starburst were heavily obscured ( compton - thick ; @xmath5 @xmath6 ) during this stage and probably only observable in far - infrared bands .",
    "radiative feedback from the agn then caused the expansion of a central hot bubble , first briefly revealing the agn as a traditional quasar , and then eventually shutting down both star formation and black hole growth . after that time",
    ", the galaxy exhibited an e@xmath7a spectrum ( a post - starburst galaxy ; see yan et al .",
    "2006 ) and low x - ray luminosities .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2008b ) showed an optical cmd ( their fig .",

    "( 2004 ) , respectively , and compared the observed host galaxy colours to the colours expected from a merger scenario and from an activation scenario involving secular ( that is , in this case , non - merger ) processes .",
    "they noted that agn host galaxies typically exhibited colours that placed them on the red sequence or in the upper ( redder ) region of the blue cloud .",
    "their merger scenario predicts that the agn host galaxies start in the blue cloud and transition on to the red sequence , while the secular processes are expected to affect the host galaxy colours in the opposite manner .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2008b ) concluded that the colours of observed agn host galaxies support the merger scenario more strongly than the secular activation scenario .",
    "croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented a complementary scenario in which the energy emitted by agns with low accretion rates , in high mass galaxies , sufficiently heats gas in the disc to prevent star formation , resulting in rapidly aging stellar populations .",
    "we can use observations of agns and their host galaxies to test the validity of the predictions suggested by croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , ciotti & ostriker ( 2007 ) , hopkins et al .",
    "( 2008a , 2008b ) and others .",
    "the agns typically involved in the simulations are relatively luminous , such as quasars or seyfert galaxies , many of which should be identifiable by their x - ray emissions .",
    "x - ray luminosities can also be used to estimate the growth rate and obscuration of the black holes . comparing x - ray characteristics to galaxy colours",
    "allows a test on the connections and timescales suggested by various models .    as a stellar population ages , its optical colours shift from blue to red , corresponding to a decrease in the temperature and energy output of the stars , so that unbiased galaxy colours indicate the dominant age of the stellar populations in a galaxy .",
    "recent models , such as those described above , make specific predictions about the connection between black hole growth and the ages of stellar populations within a galaxy . the prediction that energetic feedback associated with black hole growth may halt star formation can be tested by comparing observations of galaxy colours to the black hole growth rate and obscuration of the accretion disc around the black hole .",
    "the colours most commonly used to estimate the age of a galaxy s dominant stellar population are optical ( e.g.  @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and uv - optical ( e.g.  nuv@xmath11 ) .",
    "many authors ( e.g.  baldry et al .  2004 ; bell et al .  2004 ;",
    "faber et al .",
    "2007 ) have demonstrated that galaxies form a bimodal distribution in a variety of optical colours , and faber et al .",
    "( 2007 ) further detected a net flow of galaxies from the ` blue cloud ' to the ` red sequence ' .",
    "however , young stars contribute significantly to the ultraviolet continuum , suggesting that _ uv - optical _ colours may provide a better indication of _ recent _ star formation ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "wyder et al .",
    "( 2007 ) studied the uv - optical colour nuv@xmath11 and found not only a bimodal distribution but also a significant population between the two colour extremes , now known as the ` green valley ' .",
    "various studies have since presented observations characterizing the green valley as a possible transition region between the blue cloud and the red sequence ( e.g.  martin et al .  2007 ;",
    "schiminovich et al .",
    "2007 ) , particularly for agn host galaxies , in which feedback may significantly affect the star formation rates ( e.g.  schawinski et al .  2007 ;",

    "a full description of an agn host galaxy depends on measurements of observable features such as colours and the distribution of light in the galaxy .",
    "however , the spectrum emitted by an agn differs significantly from that emitted by its host galaxy and can dominate optical observations .",
    "this is most clearly seen in quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) , but may also be evident in less luminous agns .",

    "2005 ) observations .",
    "they showed that light from stars in the _ outer _ regions of these agn host galaxies dominates the observed uv - optical colours , indicating that the colours are not strongly affected by light from an agn . however , many current studies that use optical colours to help characterize the host galaxy stellar populations focus on more luminous agns ( such as those selected by x - ray or radio techniques ) at higher redshifts ( @xmath0 ; e.g.  nandra et al .  2007 ;",

    "they compared the measured morphologies of the original and altered galaxy images and found that high agn fractions can significantly bias the morphology measurements , but that such agns are often identifiable from the optical images due to the visibility of the agn as a central point source .",

    "it is classified as a seyfert galaxy , but it is outside of the _ chandra _ x - ray survey region , so its x - ray luminosity is unknown .    we observe a near separation between the uv - optical colours of obscured and unobscured agns at nuv@xmath130 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ub_out_nuvr_hr ] ; obscured agn host galaxies ( red triangles ) exhibit redder colours , and unobscured agn host galaxies ( blue triangles ) exhibit bluer colours .",

    "one of the reddest hosts has a very low level of obscuration ( objno 12020028 ; hr @xmath131 ) .",
    "in general , the blue obscured agns are not strongly obscured ( hr @xmath132 ) , with one exception ( objno 12016316 ; hr @xmath133 ) .",

    "several of the figures presented in the previous section suggest a correlation between host galaxy colours ( optical _ and _ uv - optical ) and x - ray obscuration .",
    "in particular , we find that red galaxies typically host obscured agns while blue galaxies host unobscured agns , suggesting a connection between the galaxy s star formation history and the cloud obscuring the central accretion disc .",

    "the nuclear regions have been cleared , but star formation continues .",
    "thus , we do not yet sufficiently understand the timescales during which these processes operate .    as an alternative to a correlation between significant agn obscuration and rapidly aging ( and hence reddening ) stellar populations , some of our galaxies may be experiencing dust - enshrouded star formation , with the host galaxies playing a role in obscuration of the soft x - rays emanating from the nuclear regions ( e.g.  rigby et al .",

    "kauffmann et al .  ( 2007 ) measured the host galaxy optical and uv - optical colours of a low - redshift ( @xmath135 ) agn sample selected using optical spectroscopy .",
    "taking advantage of the ability to measure the nuclear spectra of a nearby sample , they estimated the ages of the nuclear stellar populations [ using @xmath136(4000 ) and h@xmath137 and the agn accretion rates ( using l[oiii ] ) .",
    "in addition , they measured the integrated optical ( @xmath16 ) and uv - optical ( nuv@xmath17 ) galaxy colours and considered the optical ( @xmath138 ) colour profiles .",

    "however , they also determined that the nuclear _ colours _ were independent of the agn accretion rates , and that the integrated uv - optical colours were not correlated with the age of the nuclear stellar population .",
    "furthermore , they found that a young stellar population in the outer region does not correlate with either a young nuclear stellar population or a high agn accretion rate .",
    "even though the sample discussed here ( at @xmath0 and x - ray - selected ) differs from the sample used by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the two sets of results are consistent in that we also find that the integrated uv - optical colours are only loosely correlated with the nuclear optical colours of the galaxies . in the context of the present study , we take this to mean that the integrated uv - optical colours are not biased by the nuclear regions ( particularly the accreting black hole ) of most agn host galaxies .",
    "thus , what kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed for the hosts of low - redshift , optical spectroscopically selected agns , we have shown to also be true for their higher - redshift , x - ray - selected counterparts .",

    "ciotti & ostriker ( 2007 ) presented a scenario that intimately links host galaxy stellar populations with black hole growth and agn feedback . in their picture , supernovae release metal - rich gas from aging stellar populations , about half of which is caught up in galactic winds , while a radiative instability causes about half to collapse toward the nuclear regions and feed a central starburst ; the remaining small fraction of the gas ( estimated at @xmath146 per cent ) feeds the central smbh .",

    "this cycle may repeat after the nuclear regions have cooled sufficiently .    with a predicted duty cycle of only a few per cent",
    ", we expect to detect no more than one x - ray - luminous , unobscured agn ( i.e. , a system in the predicted qso phase ) in our sample .",
    "though we observe one red - sequence agn host that has an apparent point source ( objno 13009690 ) , it is x - ray - obscured and thus does not quite fit the predictions of this scenario .",
    "however our lack of observing systems during the qso phase predicted by this model is not surprising , given the predicted rarity of such systems , and probably can not be used to rule out the effectiveness of this scenario at explaining the relationships between agn and their host galaxies .",
    "we do not expect to detect compton - thick agns with the aegis _ chandra _ survey , so such objects would not be included in our agn sample .",
    "however , they may be included in the control sample , because they would possess redshifts and stellar masses similar to those of agn host galaxies .",

    "they are heavily obscured , but not compton - thick .",
    "central starbursts subjected to heavy obscuration lead to the typically red nuclear colours .",
    "2 .   obscured but highly x - ray luminous agns ( encircled red triangles ) may represent a slightly later stage during which the agns are approaching peak growth , but have not yet caused sufficient feedback to shut down star formation and significant black hole accretion .",
    "unobscured agns exhibiting high x - ray luminosities ( encircled blue inverted triangles ) have recently caused the expansion of a central hot bubble , shutting down the star formation and agn growth , but briefly revealing the agn as a qso .",
    "the nuclear light of the host galaxies may suffer contamination from the agn light , making it difficult to determine the definite ages of the nuclear stellar population .",
    "low x - ray luminosities in unobscured agns ( uncircled blue inverted triangles ) would indicate the final stage of the agn cycle , in which the black hole growth has significantly slowed and the stellar population has begun to age and redden , explaining the redder nuclear colours of some of the host galaxies .",

    "the model presented by ciotti & ostriker ( 2007 ) seems consistent with the characteristics of a sub - sample of the observed agn host galaxies , but does not fully explain either every characteristic or every agn host . for example ,",
    "several of the unobscured agn host galaxies represented in figs [ fig : hist_ub_out ] and [ fig : delta_ub_mb_hr_ps ] exhibit blue outer colours .",
    "this scenario does not provide an obvious explantion for the apparent star formation in the outer regions of the galaxy , particularly if the agn is triggered by gas collapse toward the _ nuclear _ regions .",
    "we may expect that expansion of the central hot bubble connects the x - ray obscuration of the agn with the nuclear colours , but it would not be expected to significantly affect the outer colours .",
    "croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented two complementary scenarios for agn accretion and feedback , one of which ( the ` quasar mode ' ) is very similar to the model discussed by hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005a , 2005b , 2008a ) , so we will focus our comparison to their work on ` radio mode ' accretion and feedback .",

    "though not explicitly predicted from the radio mode models , we would expect such systems to exhibit red optical colours ( nuclear and outer ) and relatively low x - ray luminosities , due to the low rate of accretion of material on to the black hole .",
    "figs [ fig : ub_out_nuvr_hr ] and [ fig : ub_nuc_nuvr_hr ] show that our sample contains agn host galaxies that appear to be consistent with the scenario described by croton et al .",
    "several obscured agn host galaxies exhibit low x - ray luminosities ( @xmath150 erg s@xmath51 ) and red optical colours in both the nuclear and outer regions ; most of these galaxies exhibit green - valley and red - sequence uv - optical colours .",
    "clearly , this scenario is not meant to describe the observations of all agn host galaxies at all times , but it does offer an additional explanation to supplement the models presented by ciotti & ostriker ( 2007 ) , hopkins et al .",
    "( 2008a , 2008b ) and many others .",
    "however , current semi - analytic models , such as that described by croton et al .",

    "the models described above apply to different galaxy populations , such as isolated giant ellipticals and interacting gas - rich discs .",

    ", it seems reasonable to expect that multiple explanations are needed to properly describe them all .",
    "in addition , the time scales of the processes involved seems quite important for comparisons between observations and the models .",
    "agns can be selected by a variety of methods , such as the x - ray luminosity requirement used for the current study , characteristic emission lines or emission line ratios from optical spectra ( e.g.  baldwin , phillips & terlevich 1981 ) , infrared colours ( e.g.  lacy et al .",

    "however , these methods do not provide identical agn samples , complicating attempts to characterize a ` typical ' agn host galaxy .",
    "perhaps the most commonly identified problem with x - ray selection is that the accretion discs of many agns experience significant attenuation from an obscuring cloud , that is , they are compton - thick ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) ; the x - rays are absorbed by the intervening material and re - emitted at ir wavelengths .",
    "on the other hand , lower levels of obscuration may prevent spectral identification of agns without hindering x - ray detection ( e.g.  rigby et al .",

    "donley et al .",

    "they found few differences between characteristics such as x - ray to optical ratios and column densities of x - ray - detected and weakly x - ray - detected samples , suggesting that the two samples represent intrinsically similar agn populations .",
    "the ` weakly x - ray - detected ' sample was comprised of x - ray sources detected at a lower significance than was required for the initial sample ; these sources were only detected after the positions of their host galaxies had been determined . the inability to detect 60 per cent of the radio - excess agns",
    "could be explained by the orientation of the accretion disc relative to an observer s line - of - sight to the galaxy , instead of intrinsic differences in the agns .    though donley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) did not address the colours of the agn host galaxies , if the detected and undetected agn populations _ are _ intrinsically similar , then it would be reasonable to expect that the colour gradients of the undetected agn hosts would be similar to the colour gradients of the agn hosts discussed in the current study .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the similar distributions of column densities shown by donley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which are related to the x - ray hardness ratios presented in the current study .",
    "thus the relationships between colour gradients and column densities should be similar to the relationships discussed in section [ results ] between colour gradients and hardness ratios .    by stacking x - ray observations of galaxies that are not individually detected by the 200 ks aegis _ chandra _ survey , georgakakis et al .",

    "this again suggests that despite the incompleteness of the x - ray selection technique due to x - ray obscuration , inclusion of the missing agns would probably not significantly affect the results presented here .    the agn sample described in section [ data ] does not contain any spectroscopically identified qsos ( i.e.  broad - line agns ) , though it does include eight agns that have @xmath152 erg s@xmath51 , which has also been used to define qsos ( e.g.  barger et al .",

    "however , the _ nuclear _ optical colours of unobscured agns are generally much bluer than those of the control sample galaxies ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ub_nuc_nuvr_hr ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the integrated colours typically represent the outer colours , not the nuclear colours .",
    "we therefore conclude that integrated nuv@xmath11 colours ( as well as redder optical colours ) are generally reliable , even for x - ray - luminous agns , unless the agns are luminous , unobscured , _ and _ exhibit large colour gradients .",

    "these colours are not likely to be contaminated by blue light from the agns , the agn host galaxies have stellar populations that are younger than typical red - sequence galaxies .",
    "models predicting that major mergers cause agn activity may explain a small fraction of the agns discussed in the current work .",
    "however , it appears that the majority of observed agns require alternate explanations , such as gas collapse caused by radiative instabilities .",
    "this work has shown that even for high - luminosity agns at @xmath0 , the optical and uv - optical colours are not likely to be strongly biased , unless the agn is very luminous , unobscured and/or visible as a point source in an optical image .",
    "we have further shown that x - ray obscuration of the accretion disc correlates with galaxy colour . by considering a combination of predictions from various models ,",
    "we seem to be able to explain the majority of the agn hosts discussed here , but more work is needed to fully understand the connections between significant nuclear activity and a galaxy s star formation history .",
