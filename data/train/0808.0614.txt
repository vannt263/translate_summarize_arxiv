    "much of early interest to ds spacetime was motivated by the questions related to the quantization of fields propagating on curved backgrounds .",
    "this spacetime has a high degree of symmetry and numerous physical problems are exactly solvable on this background .",
    "the importance of this theoretical work increased by the appearance of  the inflationary cosmology scenario lind90 . in most inflationary models ,",
    "an approximately ds spacetime is employed to solve a number of problems in standard cosmology . during an inflationary epoch ,",
    "quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field introduce inhomogeneities and may affect the transition toward the true vacuum .",
    "these fluctuations play a central role in the generation of cosmic structures from inflation .",
    "more recently astronomical observations of high redshift supernovae , galaxy clusters and cosmic microwave background @xcite indicate that at the present epoch , the universe is accelerating and can be well approximated by a world with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "if the universe would accelerate indefinitely , the standard cosmology would lead to an asymptotic ds universe .",
    "hence , the investigation of physical effects in ds spacetime is important for understanding both the early universe and its future .",
    "many of high energy theories of fundamental physics are formulated in higher - dimensional spacetimes . in particular , the idea of extra dimensions has been extensively used in supergravity and superstring theories .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the extra dimensions are compactified . from an inflationary point of view , universes with compact spatial dimensions , under certain conditions , should be considered a rule rather than an exception @xcite .",
    "the models of a compact universe with non - trivial topology may play important roles by providing proper initial conditions for inflation . as it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is no reason to believe that the version of ds spacetime which may emerge from string theory , will necessarily be the most familiar version with symmetry group @xmath0 and there are many different topological spaces which can accept the ds metric locally .",
    "there are many reasons to expect that in string theory the most natural topology for the universe is that of a flat compact three - manifold . the quantum creation of the universe having toroidal spatial topology is discussed in @xcite and in references @xcite within the framework of various supergravity theories .",
    "the compactification of spatial dimensions leads to a number of interesting quantum field theoretical effects which include instabilities in interacting field theories @xcite , topological mass generation @xcite and symmetry breaking @xcite . in the case of non - trivial topology ,",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on fields give rise to the modification of the spectrum for vacuum fluctuations and , as a result , to the casimir - type contributions in the vacuum expectation values of physical observables ( for the topological casimir effect and its role in cosmology see grib94,most97 and references therein ) . in the kaluza - klein - type models ,",
    "the casimir effect has been used as a stabilization mechanism for moduli fields which parametrize the size and the shape of the extra dimensions .",
    "the casimir energy can also serve as a model for dark energy needed for the explanation of the present accelerated expansion of the universe ( see milt03 and references therein ) .",

    "the important quantities that characterize the quantum fluctuations during the ds expansion are the fermionic condensate and the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor . in the next section , by using the dimensional regularization procedure , we evaluate these quantities in uncompactified odd - dimensional ds spacetimes . the plane wave fermionic eigenfunctions in @xmath2-dimensional ds spacetime with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified dimensions are constructed in section [ sec : eigfunc ] . in section [ sec : fermcond ] these eigenfunctions are used for the evaluation of the fermionic condensate in both cases of the fields with periodicity and antiperiodicity conditions along compactified dimensions . the behavior of these quantities are investigated in asymptotic regions of the parameters .",
