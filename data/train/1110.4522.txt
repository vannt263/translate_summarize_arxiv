    "<S> this shift completely blocked the @xmath22 to @xmath23 hole cyclotron resonance transition and revealed the @xmath5 = 0 to @xmath26 electron cyclotron resonance transition . as a result , due to graphene s unique band structure , we simultaneously observed both hole and electron cyclotron resonance in the magnetic quantum limit , even with a @xmath1-type graphene sample . </S>",
    "<S> these high - field studies therefore allow for a clear identification of cyclotron resonance features in large - area graphene samples , and an accurate determination of their low carrier mobilities and fast scattering times .    </S>",
