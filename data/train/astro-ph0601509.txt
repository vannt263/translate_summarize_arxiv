    "studies of galaxy formation and evolution both in the local group and in the high - redshift universe ( conselice et al .",
    "2003 ) provide increasing evidence that mergers play a role in the formation of early - type galaxies , in clusters and in the field ( schweizer 1999 , hibbard & yun 1999 ) .",
    "the merging of two disk galaxies produces a spheroidal remnant with physical properties , such as density profiles , mean velocity dispersion and surface brightness , similar to those observed for elliptical and early - type disk galaxies ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; gerhard 1981 ; barnes & hernquist 1992 ; bekki 1998a ; naab & burkert 2003 ; bournaud et al .",
    "these kind of mergers may also produce a prg ( bekki 1998b ; bournaud & combes 2003 ) , like ngc  4650a ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "prgs generally contain a central featureless stellar spheroid and an elongated structure , the `` polar ring '' , which in projection appears close to the inner spheroid s meridian plane . in all prgs , the gas is associated with the polar structure and not with central stellar spheroid ; furthermore the stars in the central spheroid and the gas and stars in the polar structure rotate in two nearly perpendicular planes .",
    "the studies of prgs promise to yield detailed information about some of the processes at work during galaxy merging and on the shape of dark matter halos in galaxies ( schweizer , whitmore & rubin 1983 , sackett & sparke 1990 , sackett et al .",
    "1994 , combes & arnaboldi 1996 , iodice et al . 2003 ) .",
    "ngc  4650a is the prototype for prgs .",
    "its luminous components , inner spheroid and polar structure , have been studied with optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry , optical spectroscopy , and in the radio (  21 cm line and continuum ) .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the central spheroid is described by an exponential law , with a small exponential nucleus ; its integrated optical vs. nir colors are similar to those of an intermediate age stellar population ( iodice et al .",
    "2002 ; gallagher et al .",
    "previous absorption line spectroscopy at optical wavelengths showed a substantial rotation along the major axis , with @xmath0 ( whitmore et al .",
    "1987 , sackett et al .",
    "1994 ) , while the velocity dispersion measurements were plagued by systematic errors , caused by both low angular and low spectral resolution .",
    "best estimates gave @xmath1 .",
    "the polar structure in ngc  4650a has been shown to be a disk , rather than a ring .",
    "its stars and dust can be reliably traced inward within the stellar spheroid to @xmath2 kpc radius from the galaxy nucleus ( iodice et al .",
    "2002 ; gallagher et al .",
    "emission and absorption line optical spectra show that it is an extended stellar disk rather than a narrow ring ( swaters & rubin 2003 ) : both rotation curves show a linear inner gradient and a plateau , as expected for a disk in differential rotation . furthermore the  21 cm observations ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1997 ) show that the gas is 5 times more extended than the luminous polar structure , with a position - velocity diagram very similar to those observed for edge - on gaseous disks .",
    "the question about the shape of the dark halo of ngc  4650a is still open . because of the large error - bars in the velocity dispersion profile , dynamical models by sackett et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and combes & arnaboldi ( 1996 ) , which differ in the orientation of the main axes and flattening of the dark halo , were both compatible with the observed data .",
    "the polar disk luminous mass distribution along the meridian plane may also affect the inner stellar kinematics and induce a triaxial - like perturbation to the axisymmetric stellar mass distribution .",
    "kinematic information along independent position angles on the sky may therefore be required for a reliable mass model .",
    "furthermore , moving to longer wavelength may help reducing the contamination from the dust ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1995 ) .    an 8 meter class telescope , with a spectrograph like fors2 and a high efficiency holographic grism in the 1 micron wavelength range shall allow us to study the stellar motions of the ngc  4650a inner spheroid , via the absorption line spectroscopy of the calcium triplet ( cat ) lines , at 8498  , 8542  , 8662  .",
    "these lines are the strongest features in the stellar continuum for a large variety of stellar types ( cenarro et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this work",
    ", we shall present our measurements for the radial velocity , the velocity dispersion profile and the gaussian hermite parameters @xmath3 along the main photometric axes of the central spheroid in ngc  4650a .",
    "we then discuss their implication on the proposed mass models and formation scenario for prgs . in what follow",
    ", we shall adopt 2905 as the heliocentric systemic velocity of ngc  4650a ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1997 ) and h@xmath4mpc@xmath5 , which implies @xmath6 pc .",
    "the spectra were obtained with fors2@ut4 , on the eso vlt , in service mode , during the observing run 70.b-0277 .",
    "fors2 was equipped with the mit ccd  910 , with an angular resolution of @xmath7 pixel@xmath5 and a binning of two pixels , so the final scale is @xmath8 pixel@xmath5 .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out with a slit @xmath9 wide and @xmath10 long , and grism gris-1028z+29 in the @xmath11   wavelength range , which covers the red - shifted absorption lines of the cat at the systemic velocity of ngc  4650a .",
    "the nominal spectral resolution is 0.86 pixel@xmath5 .",
    "spectra were acquired at the position angles of the photometric major ( pa=@xmath12 ) and minor ( pa=@xmath13 ) axes ( iodice et al .",
    "2002 ) of the stellar spheroid ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "a total integration time of 5 hours was acquired for the major axis and 4.5 hours for the minor axis , with an average seeing of @xmath14 and of @xmath15 respectively . in the final median averaged spectra we reach a limiting surface brightness of @xmath16 mag arcsec@xmath17 at @xmath18 along the spheroid major axis .",
    "spectra of standard template stars of the k0iii and k3iii spectral types , were also acquired and trailed along the slit .",
    "the frames were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded and calibrated using standard iraf tasks , with helium , argon and neon arc - lamps taken for each observing night .",
    "the final solution for the wavelength calibration reaches an rms of 0.07  .",
    "the instrumental resolution measured from the arclamp spectra is @xmath19  ; at the cat wavelengths , this is equivalent to a velocity resolution of @xmath20 .",
    "the sky spectrum was extracted at the outer edges of the slit , where there is no galaxy light , and subtracted off each row of the two dimensional spectra by using the iraf task background in the twodspec.longslit package . on average ,",
    "a sky subtraction better than @xmath21 was achieved ; in the region for @xmath22  , where the sky emission lines are stronger and blended ( fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) , residuals are less than the @xmath23 . after sky subtraction , for each pa , the scientific frames were co - added to a final median averaged 2d spectrum .",
    "the final spectrum from the major axis slit at the center of ngc  4650a is shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "the final steps of the data - processing were _",
    "i ) _ the binning of the spectra along the spatial direction to achieve a minimum signal - to - noise ( s / n ) @xmath24 at all radii ( which is the s / n measured at the last data points , while the central pixels have higher s / n by up to a factor of 4 ) and to leave no more than 2 independent data points within the seeing disk ; _ ii ) _ removal of the galaxy continuum by fitting a forth order polynomial ( for a detailed description of the procedures see bender , saglia & gerhard 1994 ) .",
    "the _ line - of - sight velocity distribution _ ( losvd ) was recovered from the continuum - removed spectra using the fourier correlation quotient ( fcq ) method ( bender 1990 ; bender , saglia & gerhard 1994 ) . by assuming that the losvd is described by a gaussian plus third- and fourth - order gauss - hermite functions ( van der marel & franx 1993 ; gerhard 1993 ) , the rotational velocities @xmath25",
    ", velocity dispersions @xmath26 and first order deviations from gaussian profiles , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , were derived at each radius .",
    "the best fit to the spheroid spectrum was obtained with the k3iii template , while the k0iii stellar template was discarded because of a significant mismatch .",
    "both statistical and systematic errors for our radial velocity , @xmath29 and the @xmath27 and @xmath28 parameters were studied via monte carlo simulations ( bender , saglia & gerhard 1994 ; mehlert et al .",
    "it turns out that , for all these kinematic quantities , the statistical errors dominate with respect to systematic errors at all radii .",
    "the three lines of the paschen sequence , p13 , p15 and p16 at @xmath30  , 8545   and 8502  , lie within the red wings of the cat lines ( cenarro et al .",
    "2001 ) , and they may affect the measured @xmath25 and @xmath26 , if the adopted stellar template does not match them . therefore we need to quantify the equivalent width of the paschen hydrogen lines , and their strength along the slit , and compare them with the features in the stellar template spectrum , before we derive the spheroid stellar kinematics in ngc  4650a .",
    "we measured the equivalent width ( ew ) of the unblended paschen lines p14 , p17 , hereafter pa(17 - 14 ) , at @xmath31  , 8467  , and the caii @xmath32  , 8542   along the slit for the two axes ; the ew of the paschen absorption line p12 ( @xmath33  ) can not be measured reliably because of some strong sky lines residuals which affect the estimates of the continuum flux ( fig.[spectra ] ) .    in fig.[pat ]",
    ", we show the pa(17 - 14 ) , the caii ews and their ratios along the two axes . in the central region of the ngc  4650a spheroid and along its major axis , the pa(17 - 14 ) and",
    "the caii ews are similar to those computed for a synthetic galaxy spectrum using the k3iii template star .",
    "they are consistent with the values of ews observed for the stellar integrated light of early - type galaxies ( saglia et al .",
    "2002 ; falcon - barroso et al .",
    "2003 ) .    along the minor axis , at distances larger than @xmath34 , the pa(17 - 14 ) vs. caii",
    "ew ratio seems to reach values which are comparable to those observed for star forming galaxies ( saglia et al .",
    "the larger values for the pa(17 - 14 ) ew at these radii may indicate a contribution to the light from young stars in the polar disk .    in order to test whether the contribution of a young stellar population may affect the kinematics , we produced synthetic spectra combining stars of spectral type a and k , and measured the the pa(17 - 14 ) vs. caii ew ratio .",
    "fig.[pat ] shows that a template with an increasing contribution from an a - type spectrum , from a @xmath35 to a @xmath36 , has pa(17 - 14 ) ews which are matching the larger values measured in the outer regions of the spheroid minor axis .",
    "once this synthetic spectrum is broadened to 80 dispersion and analyzed using a pure k template with the fcq method , the measured velocity dispersion is then 86 , 90 and 100 for the @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 cases .    along the spheroid minor axis at @xmath40 and @xmath41 the paschen lines strength are consistent with those of @xmath37 and @xmath39 templates ; from our tests , the effects caused by the contribution from younger stars may cause the measured @xmath26 to be overestimated of about 6and 20respectively .    from the present analysis",
    "we can conclude that the k3iii template is adequate for the kinematic analysis in the center and along the major axis . in the outer regions of the minor axis we found that the young stars in the polar disk might cause an increase in the paschen lines strength ( see also sect.[min ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , given the large errorbars of the pa(17 - 14 ) ews , a pure k template is still compatible with the data and it is adopted to measure the kinematics for both axes and at all radii .",
    "the kinematics along the major axis of the stellar spheroid in ngc  4650a were previously measured from absorption line spectra at optical wavelengths ( 4100 - 4500   and 5085 - 5980  ) .",
    "the latest measurements based on the mg _ b _ and the na i absorption lines were performed by sackett et al .",
    "( 1994 ) : they reported a central value for the velocity dispersion @xmath1 .",
    "this is similar to our instrumental spectral resolution , as discussed in sec .",

    "we then recovered the losvd via the fcq method , using the same template adopted for our analysis .",
    "we found that for s / n@xmath42 and an input velocity dispersion larger than 50 , the systematic error is less than 10 ; for @xmath43 , the measured values tend to the asymptotic value of 40 .",
    "for smaller values of @xmath44 , the systematic errors are larger . based on these results ,",
    "we have adopted a variable spatial binning along the slit which increases with distance from the galaxy center so that a @xmath45 is achieved as we step to larger distances from the ngc  4650a center . at the galaxy center , @xmath46 .",
    "quantitative photometry of ngc  4650a has shown that the internal structure of this object is rather complex ( gallagher et al .",

    "the high angular resolution of our spectra allows us to reveal the kinematic signature of the nucleus : within a @xmath126 radius along the major axis , we observe a decoupled component in the circular velocity profile , associated with a lower velocity dispersion .",
    "such features indicate the presence of a small core , kinematically distinct from the main central spheroid , whose extension ( @xmath127 pc ) is consistent with the photometry .",
    "this is also comparable with the sizes of the kinematically decoupled cores ( kdc ) observed in `` normal '' early - type galaxies , which varies from some hundred kpc ( kropolin & zeilinger 2000 ) to about @xmath128 pc , for the very small cores detected in hst images ( krajnovi & jaffe 2004 ) . the hst data for kdc in early - type galaxies show that the isophotes in these regions are rounder and have a different pa with respect to the outer regions ( krajnovi & jaffe 2004 ) : this behavior is very similar to what is observed in the central @xmath126 radius in ngc  4650a ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the observed kdc kinematics in early - type galaxies has very similar features to those measured in the nuclear regions of ngc  4650a ; on the whole , the velocity profile is characterized by a central asymmetry , with a flat or a decreasing velocity dispersion profile at the correspondent nuclear radii .",
    "an upper limit to the mass of the kdc observed in ngc  4650a is @xmath129 : here we have assumed that the circular - orbit speed at @xmath71 from the center is less than the squared sum of the velocity dispersion and the measured circular velocity . the nuclear mass estimate for ngc  4650a is higher than the masses of the star cluster nuclei derived for late - type spirals , which varies from @xmath130 to @xmath131 ( matthews & gallagher 2002 ; b@xmath132ker et al . 2001 ) : as already suggested by gallagher et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , this is consistent with a more luminous star cluster nucleus in ngc  4650a , for which we estimate a mass - to - light ratio @xmath133 .    the moderate age for the star cluster nucleus in ngc  4650a ( gallagher et al .",
    "2002 ) , based on the @xmath134 color , is consistent with the absence of paschen lines in the nuclear regions ( sec .",
    "[ paschen ] ) .",
    "kdc are often related to secondary event in a galaxy evolution ( bertola & corsini 1999 ) .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that kinematically peculiar nuclei may result from the merging of two disk galaxies , where the size of the kdc becomes smaller ( less than the effective radius ) as the mass ratio of the two merging galaxies is smaller than one ( balcells & gonzalez 1998 ) .",
    "kdc are also present in barred galaxies , and are characterized by a low velocity dispersion in the center ( emsellem et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this case",
    ", they are the result of a secular evolution , rather than of an interaction , because the gravitational torques by the bar drives the gas toward the central regions and this then forms new stars with lower velocity dispersion ( wozniak et al . 2003 ) , but in ngc 4650a , no evidence for a bar - like structure was detected ( gallagher et al .",
    "2002 ; iodice et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the ellipticity and pa profiles do not show the typical features observed for barred galaxies ( wozniak et al . 1995 ; erwin & sparke 1999 ) .",
    "the formation scenarios for prgs , either via major merging of two disk galaxies ( bekki 1998b ) or accretion of external material ( bournaud & combes 2003 ) , predict that some gas flows to the galaxy center and quickly forms a small star cluster .",
    "this can easily lead to the formation of a kdc in these systems .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sphkin ] , the observed kinematics and the photometry suggest that the central galaxy in ngc  4650a is a spheroid with a nearly exponential surface brightness profile , supported by rotation . in a merging scenario with low relative velocity and low impact parameter ( bekki 1998b , bournaud & combes 2003 ) , a high mass ratio is required to form a massive polar disk , as observed in ngc  4650a : the victim mass should exceed the intruder mass . according to simulations of galaxy mergers ( e.g. bournaud et al .",
    "2005 ) this would convert the intruder into an elliptical - like , not rotationally supported , stellar system .",
    "differently , in the tidal accretion scenario , with large relative velocity and large impact parameter , for a particular orbital configuration and a gas - rich donor , a polar ring and/or disk may form both around a disk or an elliptical galaxy ( bournaud & combes 2003 ) .",
    "external gas can be also accreted from the cosmic web filaments ( dav et al .",
    "2001 ; maccio et al .",
    "2005 ) : in this formation scenario , there is no limits to the mass of the accreted material , thus a very massive polar disk may develop either around a stellar disk or a spheroid .",
    "the new kinematic data obtained for ngc  4650a suggest that the accretion scenarios are favored , nevertheless more investigations are needed to solve the discrepancies between the observations and the theoretical predictions .",
