    "the progress of spintronics and physics of heterostructures which can be observed during the last years @xcite is focused on various physical phenomena , and one of them which attracts a considerable attention is the spin - dependent transport through semiconductor / spin - polarized junctions @xcite . the physics of carrier polarization and its influence on transport in composite structures such as semiconductor / ferromagnet has been studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "one of the models describing the spin - resolved carrier concentrations and currents at the junction is the two - component drift - diffusion model @xcite which predicted highly nonlinear and saturating current - voltage dependence at a single semiconductor / feromagnet junction due to the effect of spin blockade @xcite . in this model",
    "the detailed structure of the charge and current distribution at the junction area @xcite as well as the schottky barriers @xcite , the charge redistribution effects @xcite , and the bound states @xcite are not taken into consideration .",
    "still , the qualitative and distinguishable behaviour of current saturation due to the effect of spin blockade is reliably predicted under various system parameters such as the junction / semiconductor resistance ratio .",
    "the spin blockade regime arises from the spatial distribution of the spin - minority carriers which can not enter the ferromagnet region and form a cloud near the junction which growth prevents the further increase of spin - majority carrier transport if the current exceeds a threshold value called the critical current .",
    "further studies have shown the importance and promising applications of this effect also for non - stationary phenomena such as spin memory effects @xcite .",
    "the models described above were applied mainly to gaas - based semiconductor channels , but is is known that the silicon - based structures are also of big interest for spintronics due to the dominating place of silicon in currently available electronic technologies .",
    "more , the technologies of fabricating the silicon / ferromagnet structures such as si / si : mn formed on a basis of diluted magnetic semiconductors have been intensively developed during the last few years @xcite which makes their future applications in spintronics promising and creates certain questions about the phenomena described above .",
    "is there a spin blockade regime in a silicon / ferromagnet junction at specific values of applied voltage , carrier mobility and concentration ?",
    "if so , what is the critical current density and how it depends on the silicon and ferromagnet parameters such as the carrier polarization in ferromagnets and the conductivity of the semiconductor channel ? how deep can we modulate the current in the channel by manipulating the polarization of emitter or collector ferromagnets relative to each other ? in the present manuscript we study these problems in the framework of a simple but effective model of transport in the spin blockade regime @xcite which we generalize for the case of arbitrary carrier polarizations in the emitting and collecting ferromagnetic regions of the channel as well as for wide range of low- and high - ohmic n - doped and p - doped silicon samples .",
    "it is found that the current can be deeply modulated by changing the spin alignment in the emitter and/or collector ferromagnet since the critical current density is very sensitive to it .",
    "we find the analytical expression for the critical current density and calculate the current - voltage dependencies for various combinations of the channel / contact resistance ratios , as well as for n- and p - type of doping with both high and low concentrations .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section 2 we derive a model generalizing the description of the spin blockade regime for the two - ferromagnet channel with arbitrary polarizations in the emitter and collector ferromagnets and discuss the properties of the critical current density , in section 3 we plot and discuss the current - voltage characteristics for various combinations of system parameters , and the conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "the schematic view of the ferromagnet - silicon - ferromagnet channel is shown in figure [ fsif ] .",
    "the collector ferromagnet with the junction resistance @xmath0 is separated from the emitter ferromagnet by a bulk silicon channel with length @xmath1 which we consider as exceeding the spin diffusion length @xmath2 given by @xcite    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the carrier diffusion coefficient and drift mobility , respectively , @xmath6 is the electric field inside the channel , and @xmath7 ns is the typical spin relaxation time @xcite .",
    "one can see from ( [ ls ] ) that @xmath2 is maximal at zero electric field when @xmath8 and when the diffusion coefficient and spin relaxation time are big , or , since @xmath4 is coupled to the mobility via the einstein relation @xmath9 @xcite , it is clear that the spin diffusion length grows with the mobility . since the mobility in the bulk silicon is typically lower than the one for gaas @xcite , for the given parameters of the silicon the condition @xmath10",
    "is already fulfilled if @xmath11 mkm which is a reasonable channel length of bulk semiconductor structures .",
    "hence , from the point view where the spin - resolved concentration decay length is considered , the distance between emitter and collector ferromagnets here can be taken as infinite which simplifies the boundary conditions .",
    "the key parameters of our model are the variable polarization degrees @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the collector and emitter ferromagnets describing the state of their non - ideality as well as the chosen direction of polarization for the majority of carriers .",
    "for example ,",
    "the pair @xmath14 , @xmath15 corresponds to the previously investigated case @xcite where the carriers are fully polarized in the collector and fully unpolarized in the emitter .",
    "correspondingly , the choice @xmath16 , @xmath17 describes the situation when the collector and emitter are highly polarized in the same direction while the values @xmath16 , @xmath18 describe the opposite polarization at the emitter .",
    "we adopt the labeling @xmath19 for the spin - resolved current with spins in ferromagnets aligned up ( down ) . if @xmath20 is the total current density , than the spin - resolved current at the collector @xmath21 which means that @xmath22 corresponds to an ideal ferromagnet where magnetic moments are all aligned up ( down ) , and @xmath23 describes the unpolarized current .",
    "the same labeling is adopted for the carrier polarization generated by the emitter ferromagnet with polarization @xmath13 .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to find out how deep is the influence of the various @xmath12 and @xmath13 differences reflecting the polarization switch on the total electrical current in the channel .",
    "we include in our model the channel and contact zero - bias resistances @xmath24 and @xmath0 ( see figure [ fsif ] ) with variable ratio , and the direction of the carrier motion is labeled as @xmath25 ( for the electrons the actual current is @xmath26 ) .",
    "the spin blockade may occur in the contact region at the collector ( left f in figure [ fsif ] ) if the polarizations @xmath12 and @xmath13 significantly differ from each other , which enhances the contact resistance from the zero - bias value @xmath0 as long as the current builds up .     and",
    "@xmath13 in collector and emitter ferromagnets .",
    "the channel and contact zero - bias resistances are @xmath24 and @xmath0 , and the direction of the carrier motion @xmath25 is shown ( for the electrons the actual current is @xmath26 ) .",
    "the spin blockade may occur in the contact region at the collector ( left f ) if the polarizations @xmath12 and @xmath13 significantly differ from each other , which enhances the contact resistance from the zero - bias value @xmath0 as long as the current builds up.,width=321 ]    the model for the spin - resolved current densities @xmath27 and spin - resolved concentrations @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total carrier concentration is well - known @xcite and consists of the continuity equation    @xmath30    and the equation for the spin - resolved current    @xmath31    these equations should be accompanied by the boundary conditions at the collector contact @xmath32 and at the other boundary of the channel @xmath33 which is in our problem can be considered as @xmath34 . in this case",
    "the steady - state solution of ( [ ce ] ) exists @xcite which has the form of two exponents decaying to their concentrations defined by the boundary conditions at the emitter . in our model the emitter ferromagnet is described by the arbitrary polarization @xmath13 which generalizes the unpolarized case @xmath15 considered previously @xcite , so    @xmath35    the steady - state solution of ( [ ce ] ) satisfying the boundary condition ( [ nem ] ) at the emitter and the normalizing condition @xmath28 has the form    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the inverse decay length defined in ( [ ls ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 should be determined from the boundary condition at the collector when @xmath32 .",
    "if the collector is a non - ideal ferromagnet with the polarization @xmath12 , then the spin - resolved current at the collector    @xmath39    and the other boundary condition at the emitter @xmath40 is satisfied automatically .",
    "the total current density @xmath20 is related to the electric field in the channel via usual relation @xmath41 which allows to construct a closed equation for the current density and applied voltage . from ( [ jcoll ] )",
    "it follows that the conductivity of the collector junction is proportional to the concentration of the majority carriers , and at the absence of the current the junction resistance has a predetermined value @xmath0 while the silicon channel with length @xmath1 and cross - section @xmath42 is described by the resistance defined in a usual way by the carrier mobility , concentration and geometric dimensions as @xmath43 . after a simple algebra we obtain the ohmic law @xmath44 which reads in our case similar to the one obtained previously @xcite for a non - polarized emitter with @xmath15 ,    @xmath45 ^ 2}-1}}\\right)=v , \\label{cv}\\ ] ]    but in our generalized model the parameter @xmath46 defined as the critical current density",
    "@xcite depends on both the collector and emitter ferromagnet polarizations @xmath12 and @xmath13 :    @xmath47    where    @xmath48    is the critical current density for the case of fully polarized collector ferromagnet with @xmath14 and fully unpolarized emitter with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "indeed , for @xmath14 and @xmath15 the value of @xmath46 from ( [ jc ] ) is equal to @xmath49 .     measured in units of @xmath49 on the polarizations @xmath12 and @xmath13 in collector and emitter ferromagnets .",
    "the case of fully polarized carriers in the collector with @xmath14 and fully unpolarized electrons in the emitter @xmath15 considered in @xcite is shown by a reference point a when @xmath50 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath46 diverges along the line @xmath51 which means that in the case of a perfect coincidence of the spin alignment in the emitter and collector the critical current can never be reached and there is no spin blockade in this limit . in the opposite limit of maximum difference between @xmath12 and @xmath13 the value of @xmath46 is considerably smaller than @xmath49 , so the spin blockade here occurs at lower current densities.,width=321 ]    the main property of equation ( [ cv ] ) determining the current - voltage characteristic is the current saturation occurring at current densities comparable to @xmath46 .",
    "thus , it is of interest to investigate the critical current density ( [ jc ] ) in more details with respect to the tunable polarization parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the collector and emitter ferromagnets . in figure [ fjc ]",
    "the three - dimensional plot @xmath52 is shown for the critical current density ( [ jc ] ) measured in units of @xmath49 .",
    "the case of fully polarized carriers in the collector with @xmath14 and fully unpolarized electrons in the emitter @xmath15 considered in @xcite is shown by a reference point a when @xmath50 .",

    "the observed large variations of the critical current density are important for the desired high degree of control on the electrical current flowing through the ferromagnet - silicon - ferromagnet channel which can be achieved by variations of at least one ferromagnet polarization , say the emitter polarization @xmath13 .",
    "below we shall see that these expectations are confirmed by the current - voltage dependencies in both n - doped and p - doped channels with both low- and high - ohmic resistance .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics for n - doped and p - doped silicon channels with high and low carrier concentration are shown in figures [ fvah1 ] and [ fvah2 ] , respectively .",

    "for both type of carriers and for both low and high ratios of the contact / junction resistance the current saturation is observed being the indication of the spin blockade regime .",
