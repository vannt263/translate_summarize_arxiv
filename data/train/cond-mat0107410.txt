    "recent progress in microfabrication and measurement techniques makes it possible to study the properties of small superconducting structures , so called mesoscopic samples , with sizes comparable to the penetration depth @xmath0 and the coherence length @xmath1 .",
    "mesoscopic disks have been one of the most popular and exciting study objects  @xcite in this respect .",
    "the behavior of such mesoscopic samples in an external magnetic field is strongly influenced by the boundary conditions , sample size and geometry and may lead to various superconducting states and phase transitions between them .    motivated by recent experiments  @xcite , we study the properties of a superconducting disk in the presence of a step - like external magnetic field .",
    "the step - like field profile is a model magnetic field profile for a ferromagnetic dot or current loop placed on top of the superconductor .",
    "these profiles have the important property that the average magnetic field is zero .",
    "we investigate the influence of step height , step profile , and ratio between step width and radius of the disk , on the superconducting phase diagram .",
    "previous investigations of structures with magnetic dots were limited to experiments with superconducting films deposited on regular arrays of magnetic dots  @xcite and theoretical studies of single magnetic dots embedded in a thin superconducting film  @xcite .",
    "the common problem was that , for magnetic dots , the strong field present inside the ferromagnet suppresses the superconducting order parameter , and in such situations it is appropriate to adopt a boundary condition in which the order parameter itself vanishes .",
    "this spoils the effect that leads to surface superconductivity , and it is not at first obvious why magnetic dots should support the relatively large supercurrents associated with multiple vortices .",
    "therefore a possible oxide layer between the magnetic dot and the superconductor may restore the boundary condition to the one of a superconductor / insulator interface .",
    "in the present paper we put a single magnetic dot on top of the superconductor and study the behavior of our sample in such non - uniform magnetic field of the dot which enhances the possibility of obtaining various combinations of superconducting states . to better understand the problem we start from a simple theoretical model for the inhomogeneous magnetic field profile that , we believe , captures all aspects of the physics involved .",
    "models used before vary from a representation of the magnetic dot by a perfect dipole  @xcite to a magnetic field profile calculated numerically for an infinitely thin magnetic disk  @xcite . to obtain a better insight",
    "we start first with a simple step - like field model and subsequently investigate the more complicated real magnetic field profiles , which we obtained numerically .",
    "theoretical studies have predicted that in mesoscopic disks surrounded by an insulating media three kinds of superconducting states can exist - giant vortex ( a circular symmetric state with a fixed value of angular momentum ) , multi - vortex state ( a collection of single vortices which can be obtained as a linear combination of giant vortices with different angular momentum ) , and ring - shaped vortex states  @xcite with larger energy than giant and multi - vortex states .",
    "the ring - shaped two - dimensional vortex states have a cylindrically symmetric magnetic field profile and they are different from the ring - vortices which are e.g. found in three - dimensional superfluid liquid helium . in the present paper",
    "we observe giant vortex states and first - order transitions between them  @xcite , and for sufficiently large disks , multi - vortex structures , which are the analogue of the abrikosov flux - line lattice in a bulk superconductor .",
    "the latter results not only from a mixture of giant vortex states but also from giant - ring vortex combinations as well .",
    "the latter one may even lead to an off - center location of a single vortex or multi - vortices .",
    "moreover , with changing the strength of the field there is a transition between giant - giant and giant - ring multi - vortex states . increasing the step height of the magnetic field profile we found re - entrant behavior , i.e. , transition from giant to multi - vortex state and back to the giant vortex state before superconductivity",
    "is destroyed  @xcite .",
    "we found that for sufficiently large magnetic disks vortex / anti - vortex structures can be formed . in order to investigate these different vortex structures we use the method proposed by schweigert _",

    "@xcite showed that in a superconducting disk the ring - shaped vortices are unstable in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field ..",
    "our analysis is within the framework of the phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory .",
    "although this theory has only a firm mathematical derivation in a narrow range of magnetic field close to the superconducting - normal state boundary , it has been found that it gives also very good results deep inside the superconducting phase diagram  @xcite .",

    "the magnetic field strenghts of the profile ( fig .  [ fig1 ] )",
    "are chosen such that the total magnetic flux equals zero .",

    "therefore , we may assume that the order parameter is uniform along the @xmath17 direction of the disk and average the first gl equation over the disk thickness .",

    "[ fig19](a - c ) .",
    "as expected , when a negative external field overwhelms the average of the positive magnetic field of the dot in the disk center , the anti - vortex states become energetically more favorable , and , opposite , when the positive external field becomes larger than the average negative value of the ferromagnetic dot field , we see that the ground state goes through successive giant vortex states towards the normal state . for example , for a thickness of the magnetic dot @xmath269 we obtain an almost symmetrical figure with respect to @xmath270 . however , with increasing magnetic dot thickness , the magnetic field of the ferromagnetic dot ( given as insets in figs .",
    "[ fig19](a - c ) ) becomes more pronounced and we obtain two sets of curves corresponding with the vortex and anti - vortex states , each of which having two minima .",

    "[ fig20](b - c ) ) .",
    "we show numerical results for a system consisting of a superconducting disk with @xmath137 and thickness @xmath223 , and current loop with radius @xmath261 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_lpr ] ) . just like in previous case , minima in the free energy are related to average fields in positive and negative region of the current loop magnetic field profile .",
    "however , several differences exist with previous case .",
    "first , with increase of the thickness of the magnetic dot in previous situation ,  the magnetic field profile becomes more similar to our step - like field model .",
    "for the current loop case this is not so , and with increasing current in the loop the magnetic field becomes strongly inhomogeneous , rapidly increasing in the vicinity of the loop . as a consequence the minimum in the free energy for negative external field is lower in energy , and , moreover , the other minimum slowly diminishes with further increase of the current in the loop . in this case",
    "even for negative applied external field , the positive peak in the magnetic field profile of the current loop is responsible for the stabilization of the positive @xmath76-states , up to large @xmath271 ( see fig .  [ fig20](d ) ) .",
    "it is obvious that the interplay between the external and the current loop magnetic field exhibits more interesting physics due to the strong field inhomogeneity .",
    "we studied the superconducting state of a thin superconducting disk in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "a `` model '' step - like magnetic field profile was considered which is an approximation for the magnetic field profile resulting from a magnetic disk or from a current loop .",
    "the superconducting disk is assumed sufficiently thin that the magnetic field produced by the superconducting currents can be neglected .",
    "the effect of the width of the positive field region , the position of the field and the size of the superconducting disk on the vortex configuration was investigated .",
    "numerous phase transitions were found , between states with different angular momentum number and between giant and multi - vortex states , plus transitions of the ground state between different multi - vortex configurations ( _ giant - ring _ and _ giant - giant _ multi - vortex states ) . the model step - like magnetic field ( total flux through the system equals zero ) is found to stabilize the multi - vortex states both as the ground state ( i.e. , with minimal energy ) and as metastable states .",
    "increase of the width of the positive field region enhances the stability of the giant - giant multi - vortices , while enlarging the superconducting disk decreases the energy of the giant - ring multi - vortex state . in this case",
    ", the giant - giant multi - vortex states can also be the ground state but it represents a new configuration - a giant vortex surrounded by anti - vortices , and the _ total _ vorticity equals the lowest vorticity of the giant vortex states which are involved .",
    "we found that with an increase of the disk size , _ re - entrant _ behavior of the total vorticity is possible .",
    "this behavior can also be seen by shifting the field profile towards the disk boundary , i.e. for the current loop magnetic field , when giant - giant multi - vortex configurations cover most of the superconducting phase diagram region .",
    "comparison with results obtained for a real magnetic field profile shows very good correspondence with our step - like models for the cases when most of the magnetic flux is captured inside the superconducting disk . for larger radius of magnetic dot",
    ", the positive magnetic field region of the inhomogeneous magnetic field profile dominates and with increasing the magnetic dot radius , the total flux in the superconductor also increases , which is different from our model where the total flux always equals zero .",
    "thus , the positive part of the magnetic field profile determines mainly the superconducting states , which leads to slightly different physics - no _ re - entrant _ behavior is present , more different superconducting states are possible , but without the giant - giant multi - vortex states with anti - vortices , since they are strongly correlated with a re - entrance of the vorticity .",
    "addition of the background homogeneous external magnetic field , besides the inhomogeneous field resulting from the magnetic dot , brings a qualitative difference in the free energy diagram . for values of the external magnetic field between the average field of the dot in the positive and the negative region , we observe a strong interplay of the different superconducting giant states . moreover , with increase of the thickness of the dot , we obtain two strong minima in the free energy , when the total field is approximately equal to zero in the @xmath272 , and the @xmath273 region , respectively , where @xmath79 is the radius of the dot .    here",
