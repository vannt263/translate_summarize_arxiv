    "at very low temperatures , the dynamics of a trapped bose gas is described by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the macroscopic wavefunction of the condensate . as discussed in several recent reviews @xcite",
    ", there is excellent agreement ( within a few percent ) between experimental observations of collective modes for @xmath0 and theoretical calculations based on the @xmath1 gp equation . at elevated temperatures where the condensate is appreciably depleted by thermal excitations",
    ", one must consider the coupled motion of the condensate and non - condensate degrees of freedom .",
    "in a recent paper , zaremba , nikuni and griffin @xcite derived a generalized gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate atoms and a quantum kinetic equation for the non - condensate atoms , which can be used to discuss the coupled dynamics of the two components at finite temperatures .",
    "these two components are coupled through mean - field interactions as well as collisions between the atoms .",
    "two limiting cases for the dynamics of the gas correspond to the collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes  @xcite .",
    "up to the present , most experiments on the collective modes of bose gases are thought to be in the low - density collisionless limit . in this regime , the main effect of the non - condensate ( thermal cloud ) component is to damp the condensate oscillations .",
    "in addition to landau and beliaev damping due to the dynamic mean - field interaction between two components , there is damping arising from the lack of diffusive local equilibrium between the condensate and the non - condensate @xcite .",
    "the latter mechanism of damping has recently been worked out in detail by williams and griffin @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the regime where collisions between atoms are rapid enough to establish a state of dynamic local equilibrium in the non - condensate gas , the dynamics of the system is described by hydrodynamic equations for a few local variables .",
    "this regime contains much new physics and it should be accessible taking advantage of the larger densities now available as well as the large scattering cross sections close to a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "we have recently given a detailed derivation and discussion of two - fluid hydrodynamic equations for trapped atomic gases at finite temperatures  @xcite , starting from a generalized gp equation coupled with a kinetic equation .",
    "these equations were derived under the assumption that the non - condensate atoms are in local thermodynamic equilibrium among themselves but are _ not _ in diffusive equilibrium with the condensate atoms .",
    "the resulting zgn@xmath2 hydrodynamic equations  @xcite involve a new characteristic relaxation time @xmath3 , which is the time scale on which local diffusive equilibrium is established .",
    "this equilibration process leads to a novel damping mechanism which is associated with the collisional exchange of atoms between the two components .",
    "this zgn@xmath2 hydrodynamics is briefly reviewed in section [ zgn ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we generalized the zgn@xmath2 equations to include the effect of deviations from local equilibrium , and worked out hydrodynamic damping associated with the collisions among the non - condensate atoms . at finite temperatures of interest ,",
    "this deviation from local equilibrium within the thermal cloud gives rise to damping associated with thermal conductivity and the shear viscosity .",
    "such a generalization was first discussed in section v of ref .",
    "@xcite starting from the zgn hydrodynamic equations .",
    "we also note that the thermal conductivity and shear viscosity were first derived for a _ uniform _ bose - condensed gas at finite temperatures in pioneering papers by kirkpatrick and dorfman  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "building on our recent work with zaremba , we present a more complete derivation of two - fluid hydrodynamic equations , including dissipation . in section [ sec : ce ] , we solve the kinetic equation by expanding the distribution function @xmath4 around @xmath5 , the latter describing complete local equilibrium between the condensate and the non - condensate .",
    "we follow the standard chapman - enskog method used to derive hydrodynamic damping in the kinetic theory of classical gases . in this treatment ,",
    "the lowest order hydrodynamic equations involve no dissipative terms .",
    "all hydrodynamic damping effects are included by taking into account deviations from the local equilibrium distribution @xmath6 . in section [ sec : lk ] , we prove that , with appropriate definitions of various thermodynamic variables , our two - fluid hydrodynamic equations with damping have precisely the structure of those first derived by landau and khalatnikov  @xcite . in particular , the damping associated with the collisional exchange of atoms between the two components , which has been discussed at length in our previous work @xcite , is now expressed in terms of _ frequency - dependent _ second viscosity coefficients .",
    "this type of damping is in addition to the usual kind of hydrodynamic damping associated with shear viscosity and thermal conductivity @xcite .    in section [ sec :",
    "transport ] , we also derive explicit expressions for all the transport coefficients that appear in the dissipative terms in our two - fluid hydrodynamic equations . for the purpose of illustration",
    ", we evaluate the temperature dependence of all the transport coefficients for the case of a _ uniform _ bose gas .",
    "the case of a trapped bose gas is quite different . because the condensate density is always much larger than the non - condensate density in the central regions of a trapped bose gas , we find that the collisions between the condensate and non - condensate atoms are the dominant contribution to all transport coefficients .",
    "the lengthy analysis in sections [ sec : ce ] , [ sec : lk ] and [ sec : transport ] is , of necessity , very complex and conceptionally quite subtle .",
    "most readers will only be interested in the final conclusions , which we now summarize .",
    "we prove that the two - fluid hydrodynamic equations of a trapped bose gas can be written precisely in the well - known landau - khalatnikov form , as summarized in ( [ landau_eqs ] ) .",
    "the new feature which arises in a trapped bose gas ( as compared to superfluid @xmath7he ) is that , as noted above , the four second viscosity coefficients can be frequency - dependent , as given by ( [ zeta_omega ] ) .",
    "finally , explicit expressions for all the transport coefficients are given in ( [ kappa_final ] ) , ( [ etafinal ] ) and ( [ zeta_final ] ) .",
    "an important final result of our analysis ( see section [ sec : transport ] ) is a precise definition of three characteristic relaxation times associated with the various transport coefficients .",
    "moreover we show that the collisions between the condensate and non - condensate atoms always play the dominant role in the hydrodynamic damping of trapped bose gases .",
    "the present paper brings to a natural conclusion our series of papers ( with zaremba ) on the two - fluid hydrodynamics of trapped bose gases @xcite .",
    "much remains to be done solving these hydrodynamic equations and experimentally checking the predictions .",
