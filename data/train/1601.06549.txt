    "this paper presents and analyses a novel numerical upscaling technique for the approximate solution of a prototypical partial differential equation with arbitrary positive bounded coefficients .",
    "the focus is on coefficients @xmath2 that are strongly heterogeneous , i.e. , @xmath2 may vary rapidly on several non - separated scales and , moreover , the physical contrast ( the ratio between global upper and lower bounds of its spectrum ) may be very large .    the precise setting of the paper is as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 be a bounded polyhedral domain and let @xmath4 be a matrix - valued coefficient with uniform spectral bounds @xmath5 , @xmath6,\\ ] ] for almost all @xmath7 .",
    "given some forcing term @xmath8 , we want to approximate the unknown weak solution @xmath9 of the linear elliptic partial differential equation @xmath10 with homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "the function @xmath11 is uniquely characterized by the variational problem @xmath12 the accuracy of standard galerkin finite element approximations of the unknown function @xmath9 depends crucially on the regularity of the underlying data . on the one hand ,",
    "the rate of convergence under mesh refinement depends on interior angles of the domain and differentiability properties of @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "even if the data is sufficiently regular so that a certain rate of convergence is possible , it may be observed only if the width @xmath13 of the underlying mesh is sufficiently small . in this context , the notion `` sufficiently small '' depends on data oscillations and the contrast in a critical way .",
    "e.g. , for a scalar coefficient @xmath2 that oscillates between @xmath14 and @xmath15 at some frequency @xmath16 for some small parameter @xmath17 , the asymptotic rate of convergence is not observed unless @xmath18 . in addition , even @xmath19 is necessary to decrease the energy error below @xmath20 , which is too restrictive in many interesting cases .",
    "we emphasize that this condition is sharp for practically relevant right - hand sides @xmath21 .",
    "we are therefore dealing with pre - asymptotic effects for standard finite element methods and other related schemes such as finite volumes or finite differences . due to the high variability of the coefficient functions ,",
    "one requires extremely fine computational grids that are able to capture all the fine scale oscillations and discontinuities .",
    "hence , the numerical treatment of such equations is expensive in the sense that standard approaches result in systems of equations of enormous size and , hence , in a tremendous computational demand that can not be handled in a lot of scenarios .",
    "this paper presents a new approach for numerical upscaling based on localizable orthogonal decompositions ( lod ) into a low - dimensional coarse space ( where we are looking for our approximation ) and a high - dimensional remainder space .",
    "some selectable quasi - interpolation operator serves as the basis of the decompositions .",
    "the coarse space is spanned by computable basis functions with local support .",
    "the basic methodology was recently introduced in @xcite and generalized in @xcite . for moderate contrast and arbitrary oscillatory coefficients",
    "this methodology yields approximations that converge to the true solution at the optimal rate ( with respect to the coarse mesh size ) without any pre - asymptotic effects .",
    "the analysis avoids the strong assumptions usually made in the classical homogenization framework , such as periodicity or scale separation .    the promising numerical results in @xcite for high - contrast model coefficients are not yet reflected by the theoretical results for localized bases in those references , because the physical contrast @xmath22 appears to be a critical parameter .",
    "the dependence on @xmath22 enters the error analysis via norm equivalences @xmath23 these equivalences are heavily used to connect variational techniques such as galerkin orthogonality with approximation properties of standard quasi - interpolation operators in standard coefficient - independent sobolev spaces .",
    "the idea of this paper is to circumvent the critical norm equivalences by using coefficient - dependent quasi - interpolation operators , e.g. in @xcite , which enjoy optimal approximation properties in @xmath2-weighted sobolev spaces .",
    "our multiscale method is fully defined by the choice of the quasi - interpolation operator @xmath24 .",
    "we state a sufficient set of conditions on @xmath24 that will yield approximations @xmath25 that converge linearly to @xmath9 in the energy norm with respect to the coarse mesh size @xmath26 , without any pre - asymptotic effects and independent of the contrast .",
    "more precisely , we show that local pre - computations of the coarse basis functions on vertex patches of diameter @xmath27 suffice to derive the following error bound @xmath28 here , @xmath29 denotes a generic constant that is independent of the computational grid and depends only on the constants in the abstract assumptions that we have made on @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath24 can be chosen such that all the assumptions hold with constants that are independent of contrast and fine scale heterogeneity then the convergence is also independent of such pre - asymptotic effects .    employing ( as an example ) novel quasi - interpolation techniques related to those analysed in @xcite we are indeed able to satisfy the sufficient conditions with constants that are independent of the contrast .",
    "so far this is only possible under some conditions on the geometry of the coefficient relative to the coarse grid .",
    "moreover , the constant @xmath29 is not independent of @xmath30 and the method is thus not without pre - asymptotic effects , but it extends the asymptotic regime far beyond that of other methods independently of the contrast . despite these limitations , this result is the first one beyond heuristics to show that numerical upscaling for certain classes of high - contrast problems is possible . it may pave the way towards a comprehensive understanding of general high - contrast coefficients .",
    "in fact , our numerical tests do not show any strong pre - asymptotic effects .",
    "we shall emphasize at this point that in the lod framework the coarse basis functions depend on the particular choice of the quasi - interpolation operator . in that sense ,",
    "the methods analysed in this paper differ from those presented in @xcite .",
    "our new theoretical results improve the dependence on @xmath31 of the convergence rate and of the scaling of the supports of the underlying basis functions in those papers , as well as in the alternative approaches in the literature @xcite .",
    "the new results apply also to a more general class of coefficients than the analysis in @xcite and @xcite which is also independent of @xmath31 .",
    "our approach belongs to the large class of multiscale methods .",
    "these methods , typically , decouple the necessary fine scale computations into local parts to decrease the computational cost without suffering from a remarkable loss in accuracy .",
    "prominent examples of multiscale methods are the multiscale finite element method ( msfem ) proposed by hou and wu @xcite and the heterogeneous multiscale method ( hmm ) by e and engquist @xcite . in contrast to our approach , msfem and hmm are typically not constructed for a direct approximation of the unknown solutions but for homogenized solutions and corresponding correctors instead .",
    "thus , the reliable approximation of the exact solution is up to unknown modeling errors that punishes the lack of proper periodicity and scale separation .",
    "our framework is related to another classical multiscale method , the variational multiscale method ( vmm ) proposed by hughes et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to msfem and hmm , the vmm aims at a direct approximation of the exact solution without suffering from a modeling error remainder arising from homogenization theory . for connections between the methodologies we refer to @xcite .",
    "an interesting extension of the msfem method to more general heterogeneous coefficients without assumptions like periodicity and scale separation is the generalised msfem @xcite .    the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows . section  [ s : abstract ] defines the abstract methodological framework .",
    "in particular , abstract axioms on the underlying quasi interpolation are formulated that guarantee contrast - independent performance of the corresponding method shown in section  [ s : apriori ] . in section  [ s : qi ]",
    "we then present particular examples of quasi interpolation operators that satisfy the previous axioms for certain classes of coefficients .",
    "section  [ s : numexp ] discusses the results and their limitations in the light of several numerical experiments .",
    "in this section , we propose an abstract multiscale method based on the framework of localizable othogonal decompositions .",
    "the framework is inspired by the variational multiscale method of hughes et al .",
    "@xcite but takes a very different point of view and follows the specific constructions proposed in @xcite . for a re - interpretation within the stabilization framework of the original vmm",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient is a continuous , surjective and uniformly stable quasi - interpolation operator from some fine scale finite element space to an initial coarse space @xmath32 that has certain @xmath1-approximation properties uniformly with respect to the contrast . following the approach in @xcite , it is then possible to design a new coarse space that is provably robust even in the high contrast regime .",
    "the localization of the basis functions depends only mildly on the contrast .",
    "let @xmath33 denote a regular triangulation of @xmath34 into closed simplices and let @xmath35 denote the @xmath33-piecewise constant mesh size function with @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "additionally , let @xmath38 be a regular triangulation of @xmath34 that is supposed to be a refinement of @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that @xmath38 is sufficiently small so that all fine scale features of the coefficient @xmath2 are captured .",
    "the mesh size @xmath13 denotes the maximum diameter of an element of @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding classical ( conforming ) finite element spaces of continuous piecewise polynomials of degree @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 by @xmath41 we denote the set of interior vertices of @xmath33 ( representing the degrees of freedom of the coarse finite element spaces ) .",
    "for every vertex @xmath42 , let @xmath43 denote the associated nodal basis function ( hat function ) characterized by the property @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "we will also need the vertex patches @xmath46    from now on , we denote by @xmath47 the classical finite element ( fe ) approximation of @xmath9 in the discrete ( highly resolved ) space @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath47 solves @xmath49 we assume that @xmath48 resolves the micro structure , i.e. , that the error @xmath50 becomes sufficiently small by falling below a given tolerance .",
    "moreover , we assume that the contrast relative to the fine mesh @xmath51 is small in the sense of @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .      as stated above",
    ", the key tools in our construction are an initial coarse space @xmath54 with certain local @xmath1-approximation properties and a quasi - interpolation operator @xmath55 that is linear , continuous and surjective . the kernel of this operator is going to be our fine space ( or remainder space ) @xmath56 .    to simplify the presentation we will for the most part only consider the special case , when the piecewise linear coarse space @xmath57 has the appropriate @xmath1approximation properties .",
    "as we will see , this allows us to treat a very interesting class of highly varying coefficients , namely those that are locally quasi - monotone ( in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "we will comment briefly in remark  [ rem : general1 ] below on how the framework can be extended also to other initial coarse spaces and to more general highly varying coefficients .",
    "thus , from now on we set @xmath58 and characterize the interpolation operator via some set of assumptions that must be fulfilled in order to derive a contrast - independent convergence result for the constructed multiscale method .",

    "note that @xmath24 does not need to be a projection onto the finite element space @xmath57 .",
    "the conditions ensure that the concatenation @xmath69 always defines such a projection .",

    "stability ) properties in weighted @xmath1 ( resp .",

    "finally , assumption ( qi4 ) ensures that any coarse finite element function @xmath70 is the image of some function @xmath62 under @xmath24 with smaller or equal support . in other words",
    ", there exists some bounded left inverse of @xmath24 that preserves local supports .",
    "this property also compensates the possible lack of a projection property .",

    "typical examples in the context of high contrast would be standard or generalised multiscale finite element functions @xcite and the associated natural quasi - interpolation operators @xcite . the natural @xmath1-norm in ( qi3 ) will often also be different in those cases .      in this section",

    "the key step towards the definition of an appropriate coarse space is to orthogonalize this decomposition with respect to the scalar product @xmath82 induced by the problem . for this purpose , we define a corresponding @xmath83-orthogonal projection @xmath84 as follows .",
