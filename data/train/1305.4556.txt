    "since the mid 1990s , elliptically polarized fields have been proposed as a resource for controlling strong - field phenomena , such as high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , and its applications .",
    "concrete examples are the production of isolated attosecond pulses corkum_1994,ivanov_1995,antoine_1996,chang_2004 , and , more recently , attosecond molecular imaging @xcite .",
    "this control is possible due to the fact that hhg owes its existence to a three - step physical mechanism @xcite , in which an electron is freed via multiphoton or tunnel ionization .",
    "subsequently , it propagates in the continuum and accumulates kinetic energy from the laser field on its return to the parent ion . if it recombines with the ion it releases the energy in the form of emitted high harmonic radiation .",
    "a typical high - order harmonic spectrum exhibits a plateau , with harmonics of comparable intensities , followed by a sudden cutoff , whose energy position roughly corresponds to the maximal kinetic energy of a returning electron . whether an electron will return to the parent ion or not depends on the time it is born into the continuum , and on its subsequent propagation . by an adequate choice of the external - field parameters , such as its temporal profile and polarization",
    ", one may steer the motion of the active electron in the continuum and control how it returns to the core . as a direct consequence ,",
    "one may manipulate high - harmonic spectra .",
    "this is the key idea behind polarization - gating techniques .",
    "an external field with non - vanishing ellipticity will introduce a momentum component perpendicular to the momentum an electron usually acquires from a linearly polarized laser .",
    "this new degree of freedom may be controlled by modifying the field ellipticity .",
    "for instance , lasers with changing ellipticity over time were suggested in @xcite as a way to produce isolated attosecond pulses .",
    "this was experimentally realized in @xcite , where the dependence of hhg on the ellipticity of the driving pulses was used to create a temporal window @xcite of linear polarization , for which , and only then , the generation of extreme ultra violet ( xuv ) harmonics is possible .",
    "this technique allows the generation of a broadband of xuv pulses with the possibility of single cycle pulses .",
    "this is an improvement on the attopulses produced through linearly polarized pulses , for which only the spectral portion around the cut off can be used .",
    "furthermore , polarization - gating techniques allow a substantial increase in the intensity of the attosecond pulses produced @xcite .",
    "another important application of polarization - gated pulses is the attosecond imaging of matter , in particular the reconstruction of molecular orbitals @xcite .",
    "this imaging has been first realized with aligned molecules in linearly polarized fields @xcite .",
    "however , elliptically polarized fields exhibit a series of advantages .",
    "first , they allow a greater degree of control of the angle with which an electron leaves and returns to its parent ion @xcite .",
    "hence , in principle , there is no necessity of aligning or rotating the molecule to be imaged .",
    "potentially , this provides access to degenerate orbitals , or molecules that are difficult to align .",
    "second , they allow molecular - orbital reconstruction from a single - shot measurement",
    ". this may be useful for probing dynamic processes in which space , energy and time coherence are important .",
    "finally , by playing around with the field parameters , one may suppress or enhance the contributions of individual orbits along which the recolliding electron may return @xcite .    in order , however , to be able to image molecules with elliptically polarized fields , one must disentangle the imprints left by the field on the molecular target from the features caused by the field itself . for linearly polarized driving fields , molecular imprints in hhg spectra",
    "have been widely studied , at least within the single - active electron , single - active orbital approximation .",
    "for instance , it is by now common knowledge that nodal planes cause a strong suppression in hhg spectra if they are aligned parallel to the laser - field polarization @xcite .",
    "apart from that , the high harmonic spectra from aligned molecules exhibit a multi - slit like interference pattern , with pronounced maxima and minima , which is dependent on the internuclear distance and the orientation of the molecule with respect to the polarization of the laser field .",
    "this is a structural effect that results from the electron wave packet recombining to spatially different centers . for the simplest scenario , i.e. , a diatomic molecule ,",
    "these interference patterns have been predicted since the early 2000s @xcite ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite and our recent publication @xcite ) .",
    "many of such studies have been performed within the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) , which has been generalized to molecular systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach has the particular advantage of allowing an almost entirely analytic treatment and of providing a transparent physical interpretation in terms of electron orbits , while retaining quantum - mechanical features such as spatial and temporal interference .",
    "recently , a generalized two - center interference condition for high - order harmonic generation in homonuclear diatomic molecules subjected to a linearly polarized laser field that accounts for the orbital geometry and also @xmath0 mixing has been introduced @xcite .",
    "studies of the above - mentioned two - center interference for elliptically polarized fields , however , are comparatively few .",
    "most of the studies are focused on the harmonic yield , as a function of the driving - field polarization @xcite , or on the ellipticity of the high - order harmonics as a way to probe the anisotropy of a molecular medium @xcite . in particular , recent investigations have shown that the minimum related to two - center interference becomes increasingly blurred and appears to split if the ellipticity of the driving field is increased @xcite . therein , an interference condition for the perpendicular molecular orientation was presented , which was different along the major and the minor polarization axis of the driving field .",
    "the focus of such papers , however , was on the vector character of the hhg transition probabilities @xcite , and on the ellipticity of the high - order harmonics @xcite .",
    "so far , the above - mentioned blurring and splitting has not been addressed .    in this paper",
    "we present a two- center interference condition for diatomic molecules in elliptically polarized fields .",
    "this condition is then tested in hhg spectra computed employing the strong - field approximation for aligned diatomic molecules . throughout",
    ", we work within the single - active electron , single - active orbital approximation and assume the core to be frozen .",
    "one should note , however , that there may be also imprints caused by the dynamics of the core @xcite .",
    "such effects will not be addressed in this work .",

    "the outcomes of our simulations , however , do not follow a single interference curve .",
    "this is expected as the contributions from each orbit in a pair carry comparable weights , so that temporal interference effects between the long and short orbits play a role .",
    "the interference minima appear most clearly in the cutoff region , at roughly @xmath162 , and at the bottom of the u - shaped minimum , near @xmath163 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in these energy regions , the interference conditions are closest . at the lower - energy end of the u - shaped minimum ,",
    "the three interference curves cross .",
    "hence , the two - center minimum is very visible . in the vicinity of this point , however , the three curves are very distinct .",

    "the two - center minimum is sharp around this frequency . beyond the cutoff ,",
    "the imaginary parts of the shifts start to increase in absolute value and move away from each other .",
    "this will have little influence if only individual orbits are taken , as shown in the previous section , but will be critical for a coherent superposition of orbits .",
    "for that reason , the minimum becomes blurred in this region .",
    "as in the linear case , there are high - order harmonics if orbits starting at different half cycles are included .",

    "[ fig8 ] shows .",
    "this is caused by two main reasons .",
    "first , the excursion times of the electron in the continuum are much longer , in fact over one and a half cycles .",
    "hence , a larger degree of wavepacket spreading occurs for the active electron , and this renders the contributions of such orbits less relevant .",
    "second , the cutoff determined by such pairs is lower than that determined by the dominant orbits .",
    "in fact , for the parameters employed in the figure , it lies around @xmath164 for orbits @xmath165 and @xmath166 , and around @xmath167 for orbits 5 and 6 .",
    "this implies that , beyond harmonic frequencies @xmath168 , the contributions from such orbits are strongly suppressed .",
    "finally , we observe an overall decrease in intensity , in comparison to the linearly polarized case .",
    "this is expected , as a nonvanishing ellipticity leads to a decrease in the tunnel ionization rate @xcite and also in the return probability for the electron @xcite .",
    "there is also a displacement of the cutoff frequency towards lower energies , in agreement with previous studies in the literature @xcite .",
    "( @xmath133 ) , but considering the coherent sums of the transition amplitudes associated to different combinations of orbits . panels ( a ) and ( b ) include the dominant pair starting at the first half cycle and at both half cycles , respectively , while panels ( c ) and ( d ) include the contributions from orbits @xmath117 to @xmath161 and @xmath117 to 6a , respectively .",
    "the interference condition for linear polarization is indicated by the dashed lines in the upper panels , while its counterpart for elliptically polarized fields is given by the solid lines in panel 1 .",

    "[ fig9 ] , we display the results obtained considering different coherent superpositions if both waves are in phase , i.e. , for @xmath133 . also in this case , the main effect is a blurring of the structural interference condition , except at the lowest - energy part of the interference minimum and near the cutoff .",
    "an interesting aspect is how the residual shifts that exist beyond the cutoff behave .",
    "if one considers start times in a specific subcycle , these shifts are apparent in the u - shaped structure .",
    "for instance , in figs .",
    "[ fig9](a ) and ( c ) , in which only orbits starting at the first half cycle have been included , one clearly sees that the suppression observed in the harmonic spectrum matches the solid lines in the cutoff region much more accurately than the interference condition for linear polarization ( dashed gray line ) .",
    "apart from that , this suppression is asymmetric and much more pronounced for @xmath169 , i.e. , on the right - hand side of these panels .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous discussions .",
    "if , however , the contributions from the first and second subcycles are added coherently , both this asymmetry and the residual shifts are washed out [ see figs  [ fig9](b ) and ( d ) ] . as expected from our previous discussion , ( i ) odd harmonics appear due to the periodicity of the field , as shown in the right panels , and ( ii ) the longer orbits do not influence the spectra considerably , as shown in the lower panels .",

    "apart from the above mentioned inaccuracies close to the threshold , inclusion of the minimum @xmath88 would require a much larger range of intensities and would obscure the effects we intend to analyze .",
    "the minimum @xmath172 , located in the high - plateau region , behaves in a very similar way as that encountered for @xmath1 , i.e. , there is an overall blurring with regard to the linearly polarized case and the minimum is clearest near the cutoff and at the bottom of the u - shaped minimum .",

    "this yield is much more suppressed in this harmonic range .",
    "if however , one includes starting times in both half cycles [ see figs .",
    "[ fig11](b ) and ( d ) ] , this asymmetry is lost .",
    "in this paper , we have studied high - order harmonic generation in diatomic molecules in two - color elliptically polarized laser fields .",
    "we have shown that , even within a very simple model , namely the strong - field approximation and the single active electron , single active orbital approximation , a non - vanishing driving field ellipticity introduces a dynamic shift in a two - center interference condition which , for linear polarization , is purely structural .",
    "this shift depends very strongly on the orbit along which the active electron returns to its parent molecule , and on its kinetic energy upon return .",
    "what happens is that the angle with which the electron returns is effectively incorporated in the two center interference condition . furthermore , depending on whether the electron returned with a non - vanishing transverse velocity at a field crossing , there may be a residual dynamic shift at and beyond the cutoff region for a given pair of orbits .",
    "a concrete example has been provided for the situation in which both low- and high - frequency driving waves were in phase .    for hhg transition probabilities related to individual orbits",
    ", we have found that , in general , our numerical results match very nicely the predictions from our generalized interference condition .",
    "if coherent superpositions of orbits are taken into account , the different shifts cause a blurring , and , in some cases , a splitting in the two - center minima . for elliptical polarization ,",
    "these minima are no longer sharp , but , rather , there will be a region in the spectra for which the harmonic signal is suppressed .",
    "this region is bounded by the different interference conditions encountered for individual orbits .",
    "this splitting is also visible , though not discussed , in ref .",
    "@xcite .    both the blurring and the splitting happen in most harmonic ranges , except in the cutoff region or when the modified interference conditions coincide .",
    "hence , in a realistic situation , these dynamical shifts would mainly blur the two - center minima unless they converged to a single residual shift at the cutoff , or one of the orbits in a dominant pair could be suppressed .",
    "for instance , a clear asymmetry has been found for the minimum @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] if only the events starting in the first half cycle are considered . in practice , this could be realized by suppressing the events in subsequent half cycles by an adequate field choice , such as , for instance , with a few - cycle pulse .",
