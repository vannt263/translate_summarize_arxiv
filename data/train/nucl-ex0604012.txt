    "one of the most important signals of the formation of hot nuclear matter is the emission of nuclear clusters , or intermediate - mass fragments ( imf : 3 @xmath6 z @xmath7 20 ) . from studies of the imf yields in energetic nuclear reactions",
    "one hopes to gain greater insight into the thermodynamics of highly - excited nuclei and the nuclear equation - of - state at low densities .",
    "an important aspect of such studies is the identification of a possible nuclear liquid - gas phase transition @xcite .",
    "imf emission was first observed in the 1950 s , when beams of protons and alpha particles with energies in the gev range became available .",
    "emulsion and radiochemical measurements of the reaction products showed that the probability for cluster emission increased strongly with beam energy , suggesting their association with the decay of highly excited nuclei .",
    "the emulsion measurements also provided evidence for multiple fragment emission , or multifragmentation .",
    "these data led to the concept that the reaction mechanism could be schematically viewed in terms of a two - step intranuclear cascade / statistical emission model , with imfs emitted primarily in the evaporation stage .",
    "one complication with this model was the observation that lighter clusters exhibited forward - peaked angular distributions , suggesting that a prompt non - statistical mechanism must also be present .",
    "another perceptive proposal was that pion production and reabsorbtion could be a major mechanism for excitation - energy deposition in the heavy residual nucleus@xcite .",
    "these studies , carried out at lawrence berkeley laboratory , brookhaven national laboratory and in russia , laid the groundwork for future studies and are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the development of silicon semiconductor detectors in the 1960 s made it possible to perform measurements of inclusive imf yields and kinetic energy spectra .",
    "bombardments of heavy targets with 5 gev protons provided a more systematic understanding of the earlier work , and showed clearly the existence of two mechanisms for imf production ",
    "one equilibrium - like and the other a fast nonequilibrium process @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the spectra was a downward shift in the apparent coulomb barrier relative to lower energy reactions .",
    "it was suggested that this shift was due to a modified density distribution , perhaps due to an expanded source .",
    "later , similar inclusive measurements with protons up to 350 gev @xcite confirmed radiochemical studies that indicated the imf emission probability reaches a maximum near 10 gev and remains constant thereafter @xcite .",
    "these later measurements also tracked the evolution of the coulomb peak displacement with beam energy , and found its onset to be near 4 gev .",
    "this result was interpreted as a possible sign of critical behavior @xcite , and stimulated widespread interest in this possibility .    to search for more conclusive evidence of a phase transition and critical behavior",
    ", it was necessary to develop large - solid angle detector arrays to provide fragment kinetic - energy spectra , multiplicity information , event topology and calorimetry . among the most important features of such a device",
    "are : ( 1 ) nuclide ( z and a ) identification of all products , including neutrons , ( 2 ) spatial characterization with good granularity ; ( 3 ) low detection thresholds ; ( 4 ) good energy resolution over a large dynamic range and ( 5 ) efficient , reliable detector calibration techniques .",
    "another important factor in detector design is the geometry imposed by reaction kinematics ; e.g. imf fragment distributions are nearly isotropic in light - ion - induced reactions , with a small component in the beam direction , whereas they are strongly forward - focused in heavy - ion reactions .    with improvements in detector and data - acquisition techniques , it became possible to construct complex detector arrays for performing exclusive measurements that met most , but not all , of the above conditions for complex fragments .",
    "the first such array was the lbl plastic ball / wall @xcite , which demonstrated the existence of events with high multiplicities of imfs and light - charged particles ( lcp : z = 1,2 ) @xcite .",
    "later measurements at lns saclay confirmed the high imf multiplicities and yield dependence on bombarding energy @xcite .",
    "these measurements also showed that the imf spectral peak energies decreased as a function of increasing multiplicity , consistent with the expansion scenario .",
    "subsequently , several 4@xmath0 detector arrays were constructed for the study of light - ion induced multifragmentation : the eos tpc @xcite , the berlin silicon / neutron ball @xcite , the dubna fasa array @xcite and the indiana silicon sphere ( isis ) @xcite . at the same time heavy - ion accelerator technology",
    "had advanced to the stage where it became possible to study multifragmentation in a + a reactions , which lead to the construction of several additional detectors @xcite . at the outset",
    "it should be stressed that there is general concordance among the results of all of these projects with those from isis , as can be found in @xcite . in the following sections , we survey the salient results of the isis program with gev light - ion projectiles , and address the question : is there evidence for a nuclear liquid - gas phase transition ?",
    "the indiana silicon sphere project was initiated in the late 1980 s with a specific focus on gev light - ion - induced reactions on heavy nuclei .",
    "light ions bring a unique perspective to multifragmentation studies in that they emphasize the thermal properties of the disintegrating residue , with minimal distortions of the spectra due to rotational and compressional effects .",
    "experimentally , gev light ion beams form only one emitting source , which decays in a reference frame that is very close to that of the source frame ( source velocities @xmath8 0.01c ) .",
    "in addition , the energy - deposition mechanism produces a continuous distribution of excitation energies , permitting broad coverage of the excitation energy distribution in a single reaction .    based upon previous inclusive and semi - exclusive studies @xcite",
    ", the isis 4@xmath0 array was designed in a spherical geometry , with very low detector thresholds and a large dynamic range for lcps [ lcp = h and he ] and imfs @xcite .",
    "particle identification was based on triple telescopes composed of an ion - implanted silicon detector , preceded by a gas - ion chamber for low energy fragments and followed by a csi ( t@xmath9 ) crystal for the most energetic particles , primarily lcps .",
    "an overall schematic diagram of isis is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] , accompanied by a photo in fig .",
    "the array consists of 162 particle - identification telescopes , 90 covering the angles 14@xmath10 - 86.4@xmath10 and 72 spanning 93.6@xmath10 - 166@xmath10 .",
    "the telescopes are arranged in eight rings , each of which is composed of 18 truncated ion - chamber housings . in the forward - most ring ,",
    "the si and csi detectors were divided into two segments to increase granularity .",
    "detector acceptance was 74% of 4@xmath0 .",
    "a schematic drawing of the detector telescopes is shown in fig .",
    "the detectors are mounted in gold - plated , high - conductivity copper cans .",
    "the first element in each telescope ( @xmath11e ) is an axial - field gas - ionization chamber ( gic ) , operated at @xmath8 200 v and a pressure of 15 - 20 torr of c@xmath12f@xmath13 gas .",
    "these conditions permitted identification of fragments with energies as low as @xmath8 0.8 mev / nucleon .",
    "all detectors operate in a common gas volume in each hemisphere , with vacuum isolation provided by a @xmath8 120 - 150 @xmath14g/@xmath15 stretched polypropylene window covered with a thin graphite coating .",
    "the ion chambers are followed by an ion - implanted silicon detector of thickness 500 @xmath14 m , which is sufficient to stop e / a @xmath8 8 mev lcps and imfs .",
    "the gic - si telescopes provided z resolution for z = 1  16 fragments in the energy interval from e / a @xmath8 0.8 - 8.0 mev . due to the gic energy resolution ,",
    "mass identification was not possible in the gic / si pair .",
    "the final element of each telescope was a 28 mm - thick csi(t@xmath9 ) crystal , read out by a photodiode .",
    "these crystals provided an energy acceptance of 1 mev @xmath7 e / a @xmath6 92 mev .",
    "the si - csi(tl ) pair provided z and a identification for 8 mev @xmath6 e / a @xmath6 92 mev particles and `` grey particle '' detection for fast protons and pions up to @xmath8 350 mev .",
    "the isis telescopes did not detect neutrons or z - identify heavy residues and fission fragments .",
    "detector signals were shaped and amplified by means of charge - sensing preamplifier / linear shaper nim units , with gains custom - designed for each detector type .",
    "analog signals were digitized by 12-bit 16-channel peak - sensing adcs and fast signal discrimination and multiplicity sensing was accomplished with 16-channel discriminators and time - to - digital converters .",
    "voltages for each detector type were supplied by in - house - designed , computer - controlled bias supply units .",
    "the event hardware trigger was generated from the fast outputs of the discriminators and required a minimum of three detected particles .",
    "this criterion was imposed by the high backgrounds associated with synchrotrom accelerators and biased the data against low - excitation energy events ( e*a @xmath7 1 mev ) . in software ,",
    "only events with three thermal particles , one of which with z @xmath16 2 , were accepted .",
    "more complete details for the isis array can be found in @xcite .",
    "three multifragmentation campaigns were carried out with isis : ( 1 ) e228 with 1.8 -4.8 gev @xmath4he ions at the laboratoire national saturne in saclay , france ; ( 2 ) e900 at the brookhaven ags accelerator with 5.0 - 14.6 gev / c proton and @xmath2 beams ; and ( 3 ) e900a at ags with tagged 8.0 gev / c antiproton and @xmath2 beams .",
    "the number of events with each beam is summarized in table 1 .    in the following sections we present the results obtained with isis .",
    "we first examine the collision dynamics , then the thermal observables , and finally the thermodynamics and scaling - law behavior of the data .",
    ".number of events analyzed for each system ( in parentheses ) .",
    "event acceptance requires at least three thermal charged particles in silicon detectors , one of which must have z @xmath16 2 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     based on this analysis , the phase transition is first order up to the critical point of excitation energy e@xmath17/a = 3.8 @xmath18 0.3 mev , above which it becomes continuous .",
    "analysis of the eos data @xcite yielded a value of e@xmath17/a = 4.75 mev .",
    "however , as discussed in sec .",
    "3 , when the excitation energies are calculated with the same assumptions for elimination of preequilibrium particles , the isis and eos critical energies are the same .",
    "the critical temperature for finite nuclei derived from the fisher scaling analysis is @xmath19 0.2 mev .",
    "based on the fisher scaling parameters derived from the data , it is then possible to construct the two - phase ( liquid - gas ) coexistence line over a large energy / temperature interval , extending up to the critical point , from which the full phase diagram of nuclear matter can be defined @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the isis data are well - described by binomial reducibility and thermal scaling analyses , providing a strong argument for the statistical nature of multifragmentation . further , scaling with the fisher model can be used to define the liquid - gas coexistence line , while a percolation analysis supports a continuous phase transition at higher excitation energies .",
    "both the reaction dynamics and the subsequent decay of hot residues formed in gev light - ion - induced reactions on heavy nuclei have been investigated with the isis detector array .",
    "of primary concern in this effort has been the isolation and characterization of multifragmentation events , believed to be the possible signature of a nuclear liquid - gas phase transition in finite nuclei .",
    "bombardments with proton , antiproton , pion and @xmath4he beams produce an exponentially - decreasing distribution of excitation energies that extend up to @xmath8 2 gev in reactions on @xmath3au nuclei .",
    "the deposition of excitation energy is found to increase as a function of beam energy up to a momentum of about 8 gev / c for reactions of hadrons with @xmath3au and an energy of @xmath8 4 gev for the @xmath4he + @xmath5ag system . for higher beam energies",
    "there is little additional increase in deposition energy , presumably due to a tradeoff between beam energy and target transparency .",
    "relative to other hadron beams , the optimum projectile for achieving high excitation energies is found for 8 gev / c antiprotons , for which the reabsorbtion of some fraction of the decay pions can produce enhanced excitation of the residue .",
    "for the same beam momentum , proton and pion beams are nearly identical in their excitation - energy distributions .",
    "the fast lcp component of the spectra has been analyzed with a buu model that incorporates a = 2 and 3 nuclei in the scattering matrix .",
    "best fits to the data are obtained with a version that includes modified in - medium scattering cross sections and a momentum - dependent potential . as shown in figs . 4 and 5 ,",
    "the buu calculations indicate that for central collisions the hot residues are formed in a state of depleted density  due to fast knockout followed by preequilibrium processes that occur on a time scale much faster that the relaxation time .",
    "simulation of the time evolution of the collision dynamics predicts that the entropy per nucleon becomes nearly constant after about 30 fm / c , suggesting a randomized , but not necessarily thermalized system . from comparison of the buu code with the fast lcp spectra",
    ", it is inferred that a total time of about 60 fm / c is required to reach a state of quasi - thermalization .",
    "the most fundamental signature of a liquid - gas phase transition is the observation of events in which an equilibrated hot nucleus disintegrates into multple lcps and imfs . for this purpose ,",
    "thermal events have been selected that are shown to decay isotropically in the center - of - mass system with maxwellian kinetic energy spectra from which nonequilibrium components have been removed .",
    "the cross sections for these events is of order 100 mb .",
    "figure [ fig43 ] summarizes several important features of the data that demonstrate a distinct change in reaction mechanism at an excitation energy of e*/a @xmath20 4 - 5 mev  all of which support a phase - transition interpretation . in the e*/a",
    "@xmath20 4 - 5 mev interval the emission of two or more imfs ( accompanied by multiple thermal lcps ) becomes the dominant disintegration mode . from a power - law fit to the charge distributions , it is found that the fraction of large clusters in an average event is a maximum just above the transition excitation energy , as predicted by theory .",
    "evidence for the conversion of extra thermal energy into enhanced imf kinetic energy appears near e*/a @xmath8 5 mev , although the effect is small relative to heavy - ion studies , where compressional heating may contribute .",
    "two unique results derived from isis are the evolution of the breakup density and the disintegration time scale as a function of excitation energy .",
    "the breakup density derived from analyses of the imf kinetic - energy spectra , provides evidence for emission from an expanded / dilute source .",
    "the derived breakup densities evolve from normal density at low e*/a to a nearly constant value of @xmath21/@xmath22 0.3 near e*/a = 5 mev and above , again consistent with the theoretical predictions based on phase transition assumptions .",
    "the time scale for events with m@xmath23 @xmath24 2 evolves from values characteristic of sequential statistical decay at low excitation energy to times of the order of 20 - 50 fm / c for events at e*/a @xmath8 4 mev and above , indicative of a near - simultaneous decomposition mechanism .",
    "similar to previous reports , the data also show evidence for a slope change in the dependence of temperature on heat content , suggestive of caloric curve behavior , although a distinct plateau is not observed . using a density - dependent fermi - gas model to derive temperatures , instead of the conventional isotope - ratio thermometer ,",
    "a caloric curve is obtained that is in good agreement with other results . by gating on bins of the preequilibrium spectra",
    ", it has also been possible to derive a cooling curve for these hot systems .",
    "finally , scaling - law fits to the imf yield distributions provide important confirmation of the statistical nature of the thermal events observed in these studies .",
    "a fisher model analysis reveals excellent scaling behavior up to e*/a @xmath8 4 mev , where sequential evaporative emission dominates .",
    "this result has been used to define the two - phase coexistence line for nuclear matter and serves as the basis for derivation of the nuclear phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig44 ] .",
    "a percolation model analysis that includes imf secondary decay corrections also describes the data well and indicates that at higher excitaton energies , the data are described by a continuous phase transition .    in summary ,",
    "all of the experimental evidence obtained in these studies is consistent with the concept of a nuclear liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "however , the caveat must be added that given the finite system size and very short time scales involved , the classical picture of a phase transition must be invoked with caution .",
    "it is perhaps better to say that if a nuclear phase transition exists in nuclei of a few hundred particles , this is what it looks like .",
    "over the fifteen year lifetime of the isis project numerous individuals have provided invaluable support .",
    "we wish to express our sincere gratitude to the following for their help : computer support : r.n .",
