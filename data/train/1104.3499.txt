    "a topological insulator ( ti ) , a material in which the electronic spectrum possesses an energy gap in the bulk but has the special , so - called topologically protected , edge ( surface ) states falling into this gap , is one of the focal points of current condensed matter studies .",
    "@xcite topological insulators hold high technological promise since due to the ability of their topologically protected edge states to carry nearly dissipationless current they can be utilized in integrated circuits . thus the question how robust the edge states are with respect to hybridization with the electronic states in the leads has become one of the focal points of current ti - related research .",
    "three dimensional ( 3d ) ti have the dirac spectrum with the finite mass in the bulk while the spectrum of the surface states is massless.@xcite two - dimensional ( 2d ) ti has the gapless helical edge states.@xcite the surface states in 3d ti and the edge states in 2d ti are topologically protected and are robust against all time - reversal - invariant local perturbations.@xcite it was shown experimentally that 2d ti - state appears in hgte / cdte quantum wells ( qw).@xcite the ti in three - dimensional ( 3d ) materials was found in bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 , bi@xmath2se@xmath3 and so on.@xcite    of special interest are the states that develop at the interface between a ti and an s - wave superconductor ( sc ) , like , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the proximity effect generates a superconducting pairing .",
    "it was shown that at the interface of 3d ti coupled to s - wave superconductor @xmath4-superconducting state appears but without time - reversal symmetry breaking.@xcite numerical calculations showed that the proximity of the superconductor leads to a significant renormalization of the original parameters of the effective model describing the surface states of a topological insulator.@xcite for 2d topological insulator coupled to s - wave superconductor it is known that the momentum - independent gap enters in the edge spectrum.@xcite    two - dimensional tis have a unique property : their parameters can be tuned over wide ranges of their values by the appropriate choice of the qw width @xmath5.@xcite in particular , the main parameter of 2d ti , the gap in the bulk spectrum , @xmath6 , can be changed from zero up to room temperature energy scale .",
    "phenomenological treatment of the proximity effect is based on the assumption that the gap @xmath6 in the bulk spectrum of ti is much larger than the characteristics energy of the induced superconducting correlations .",
    "unfortunately numerical calculations do not give the answer how the spectrum of the ti - sc system develops in this regime.@xcite in what follows we will focus on the gaps @xmath6 of the order of the energy of superconducting correlations .",
    "in this paper we investigate the effect of superconducting correlations on the topologically protected edge states and the bulk spectrum in the 2d topological insulator brought into a contact with the sc layer , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and show the emergence of the sc correlations in the ti similarly to what was observed in gaas containing a two - dimensional electron gas.@xcite ordinarily , the effective hamiltonian of the ti in question is constructed from the symmetry considerations , see e.g. , ref .  , and has the trivial structure of the induced superconducting potentials .",
    "we demonstrate that the symmetry reasons suggest the additional non - diagonal ( in the subband space ) terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , using the microscopic tight - binding equations we derive analytically the additional terms in the effective hamiltonian of the ti describing coupling to the @xmath7-wave isotropic superconductor ( sc ) placed on top of it .",
    "these terms become especially important in the case where the bare gap parameter @xmath6 of the ti becomes comparable to the characteristic energy of the induced superconducting correlations .",
    "we show , further , that the interplay of the superconducting and `` topological '' interactions is essential and results in several effects , in particular , the collapse of the topological order in ti .",
    "we find that while `` topologicaly protected ''",
    "edge states can ensure undisturbed propagation of the charge ( spin ) carriers , superconducting correlations can block the edge current causing a peculiar localization effect .",
    "+    on the qualitative level our results can be summarized as follows : in the absence of superconducting correlations the edge states spectrum is linear near the fermi surface , comprising of two counter - propagating electron and two hole branches , respectively.@xcite importantly , the edge spectrum is isotropic in a sense that it does not depend on the orientation of the edges with respect to crystallographic axes , although the edge electronic states wave functions are orientation dependent .",
    "namely , there is a phase difference between the wave function components corresponding to ( e ) or ( h)-subbands in ti .",
    "the bulk spectrum is characterized by the gap @xmath6 . at small sc - ti coupling ( the quantitative criteria will be given below )",
    "the edge - states spectrum acquire a gap @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , superconducting correlations mix the subband branches and thus turn the resulting electronic spectrum in ti ( edge and bulk ) , anisotropic , and @xmath8 starts to depend on orientation of the edge .",
    "this can cause localization of the low - lying edge states since an inevitable bending of the edge will create the regions along the edge were the edge - particle energy @xmath9 thus getting locked between the turning points where @xmath10 . at the turning points",
    "electron and hole excitations undergo andreev reflection and form the localized andreev bound edge states , see fig .",
