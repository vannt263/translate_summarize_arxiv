    "ternary rare earth transition metal silicides , which form in a variety of crystal structures have been widely investigated due to their remarkable physical properties @xcite .",
    "a few of them also undergo superconducting transition at low temperatures @xcite . in the early 80 s",
    ", several investigations have been carried out to understand the superconductivity and magnetism exhibited by compounds belonging to the r@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 system @xcite . in this family",
    "the fe atoms do not carry any magnetic moment but help in building a large density of states at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that a member of this series , namely , tm@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2",
    "@xcite is the first reentrant antiferromagnetic superconductor ( perhaps the only one down to 50 mk ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that we still do not know why the antiferromagnetic order among tm@xmath3 ions is a deterrent to the superconductivity in tm@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 given that the neutron scattering studies @xcite could not find any ferromagnetic component in the magnetic unit cell in this compound .",
    "a recent report has suggested that an antiferromagnet er@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 @xcite ( below 2.5  k ) also shows superconductivity below 1  k whereas an earlier heat - capacity study @xcite indicated quadruple magnetic transitions without any superconductivity down to 1.5  k. a previous study @xcite on an arc melted yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 sample reported the observation of antiferromagnetic ordering of yb moments around 1.7  k. however , that study did neither establish the kondo lattice behaviour nor the high value of the sommerfeld coefficient ( @xmath4 ) as we will see later . in this context , the physical properties of yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 are largely unexplored as compared to other compounds of the r@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 series . moreover , compounds with magnetic trivalent or nearly trivalent yb are interesting since valence instability and kondo interaction can lead to unusual properties .",
    "thus , we need to understand the absence of superconductivity in yb compound given that both tm and lu of the same series exhibit superconductivity . in this work ,",
    "we provide a comprehensive study of bulk properties such as , resistivity , susceptibility , and heat capacity of a well characterized polycrystalline sample of yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 .",
    "samples of yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 were made by melting the individual constituents ( with 2% yb excess and other elements taken in stoichiometric proportions ) in an alumina crucible which is placed inside a tantalum container and sealed in an arc furnace under high purity argon atmosphere .",
    "the whole assembly is heated in a vertical furnace .",
    "the purity of the rare - earth element yb and the transition element fe were 99.99% whereas the purity of si was 99.999% .",
    "the x - ray powder diffraction pattern of the sample did not show the presence of any parasitic impurity phases .",
    "the quality of the sample was checked with edax analysis confirming that the sample is essentially single phase with 2 - 3 - 5 composition .",
    "the nearest rare - earth distances in yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 is 3.8 @xmath7 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath8 ) was measured using the commercial squid magnetometer ( mpms5 , quantum design , usa ) in a field of 1  koe in the temperature range from 1.9 to 300  k. the ac susceptibility was measured using a home built susceptometer @xcite from 1.5 to 20  k. the resistivity was measured using a four - probe dc technique with contacts made using silver paint on a bar shaped sample of 1  mm thick , 10  mm length and 2 mm width .",
    "the temperature was measured using a calibrated si diode ( lake  shore  inc .",
    ", usa ) sensor .",
    "the sample voltage was measured with a nanovoltmeter ( model 182 , keithley , usa ) with a current of 10  ma using a 20  ppm stable ( hewlett packard , usa ) current source .",
    "all the data were collected using an ibm compatible pc / at via ieee-488 interface .",
    "the heat - capacity in zero field between 0.3 to 30  k was measured using an automated adiabatic heat pulse method . a calibrated germanium resistance thermometer ( lake  shore  inc , usa )",
    "was used as the temperature sensor in this range .",
    "the temperature dependence of the inverse dc magnetic susceptibility ( 1/@xmath9 ) of a polycrystalline yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 in a field of 1 koe from 1.9 to 300  k is shown in the fig .  1 . the high temperature susceptibility ( 100  k@xmath10t@xmath10300  k ) is fitted to a modified curie - weiss expression which is given by , @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the temperature independent susceptibility ( sum of pauli , landau and core susceptibilities ) , c is the curie constant and @xmath13 is the curie - weiss temperature .",
    "the curie constant c can be written in terms of the effective moment as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the concentration of yb@xmath3 ions ( x  =  2 for yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath8(0 ) is extremely small ( 7@xmath1610@xmath17 emu / mol ) while the values of the effective magnetic moment ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath13 are found to be 4.5 @xmath19 and @xmath2014.4  k , respectively .",
    "the estimated effective moment is found to be nearly equal to the free ion moment of the magnetic yb@xmath3 ion which rules out the possibility of mixed valent nature of yb as conjectured in an earlier study @xcite .",
    "one can also observe that below 100  k , the @xmath8 data show deviation from curie - weiss plot which could be due to the combined effect of crystal field and kondo lattice contributions .",
    "the inset shows the ac - susceptibility behavior of the sample at low temperature .",
    "this inset clearly indicates antiferromagnetic ordering of yb@xmath3 moments at 1.7  k. it must be emphasized here that we do not see the influence of any impurity contribution to @xmath8(t ) and especially the absence of yb@xmath0o@xmath1 ( t@xmath6=2.3  k ) which is generally present in many yb based compounds .",
    "the presence of a single distinct anomaly in @xmath8 at 1.7  k clearly suggests the high quality of the sample .",
    "earlier study @xcite showed that the antiferromagetic ordering temperature of the heavy rare - earth r@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 compounds do follow the degennes scaling @xcite [ @xmath21(g@xmath22 - 1)@xmath23  j(j+1 ) ] indicating that the dominant magnetic interaction is the rkky interaction .",
    "surprisingly , the same study .",
    "but the same study revealed that the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 lies far above the theoretical curve @xcite . in our opinion",
    ", there is no reason to invoke something else other than the rkky interaction for explaining the relatively large value of t@xmath6 .",
    "an ordering temperature of 1.7 k is a very common value for yb - compounds .",
    "a slightly enhanced 4f - hybridization , besides inducing some kondo interaction , leads at first to an increase of the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity ( @xmath24 ) data of yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 is shown in fig .  2 . the two insets ( a ) and ( b ) display the @xmath24 behaviour from 1.4 to 5  k and 1.4   to 50  k , respectively . the large value of the @xmath24(t ) at room temperature and a low value of the residual resistivity ratio down to 5  k could be due to either the structural disorder ( inter site change between fe and si ) or to the strong hybridization effects .",
    "it must be recalled here that the properties of the 2 - 3 - 5 silicides are highly anisotropic @xcite and the over all shape of the temperature dependence of @xmath24(t ) of a polycrystal can easily be influenced by the anisotropy .",
    "the important aspect is the the low temperature @xmath24 data on an expanded scale as shown by the inset ( b ) . from this inset",
    "one can clearly see the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath24(t ) with a log  t dependence from 9 to 25  k. the low temperature @xmath24 data below 30  k display a typical kondo lattice response with a minimum at 25  k followed by a maximum of @xmath24(t ) at 6  k. subsequently , @xmath24(t ) falls sharply below 4.5  k due to coherence .",
    "a small kink in the resistivity data at 1.7  k [ shown in the panel(a ) ] indicates a possible magnetic transition at 1.7  k , which is in agreement with the susceptibility data .",
    "the temperature dependent c@xmath25 data from 0.4 to 25  k of yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 is shown in the top panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "the inset in this panel describes the low temperature behaviour which emphasizes the sharpness of the antiferromagnetic transition .",
    "the large jump ( @xmath21 4  j / mol k ) at the t@xmath6 clearly shows bulk magnetic ordering of yb@xmath3 moments .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature obtained from the heat capacity measurements is in accordance with those obtained from the @xmath8 and @xmath24 measurements .",
    "the specific heat data of lu@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 in the normal state is also shown in the same panel .    in the second panel of fig .  3 , the temperature dependence of c / t data are shown .",
    "well below , t@xmath6 , these data can be nicely fitted with a linear and a cubic term , c  =  @xmath4  t  +  @xmath26t@xmath27 , as shown in the inset .",
    "the cubic term in this case corresponds to the contribution of antiferromagnetic magnons , since the phonons are completely negligible in this temperature range .",
    "the linear term obtained from this extrapolation , @xmath4  =  0.4j / yb - mol  k@xmath23 , can be considered as a lower limit for the sommerfeld coefficient , since the experimental data show an upward curvature at the lowest limit of the measurement .",
    "this would indicate freezing out of the magnons due to an anisotropy gap . in this case",
    ", c / t  =  0.5  j / yb - mol  k@xmath23 at the lowest measured temperature gives the upper limit for this sommerfeld coefficient .",
    "the magnetic contribution to the heat capacity of yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 ( which is obtained after subtracting the c@xmath25 data of lu@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 ) is shown in the third panel ( c ) of the fig .",
    "the estimated entropy from the experiment is also shown in the same panel .",
    "the entropy is nearly temperature independent from 7 to 12  k and reaches a value of 0.9  r  ln  2 ( r is a gas constant ) at 20  k , which establishes that the ground state is a well separated doublet .",
    "the heat capacity also shows a small negative curvature above 1.8  k to about 3  k. there are two possibilities for the tail in c@xmath25 above t@xmath6 : short range fluctuations or kondo effect .",
    "we would argue that the sharpness of the transition and the weak t - dependence of c / t above t@xmath6 are in disagreement with short range correlations , whereas the kondo scenario is supported by the resistivity maximum at 6 k and the large @xmath4 value .",
    "moreover , the entropy at t@xmath6 [ s@xmath28  =  s(t@xmath6)]is found to be 0.39  r  ln  2 , which strongly indicates that the ordered moment is heavily compensated by kondo interactions . in the absence of short range order , the reduction in s@xmath28 at t@xmath6 is due to the partial lifting of the two fold degeneracy of the ground state above t@xmath6 by kondo effect .",
    "in such cases , one can show that s@xmath28 = s@xmath29(t@xmath6/t@xmath29 ) , where s@xmath29(t ) is the entropy of a single ion kondo impurity at the normalized kondo temperature , t  =  t@xmath6/t@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the entropy has been calculated by desgranges and schotte using the bethe ansatz for a spin-1/2 kondo model @xcite .",
    "sharp heat capacity anomaly at t@xmath6 and the possible absence of short range order facilitate the use of the theory @xcite and with the experimental value of s@xmath28 , we estimate a value of 5  k for the kondo temperature of yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 .",
    "however , accurate estimation requires inelastic scattering data .",
    "the value of the entropy at 20  k is only 0.7  r which is much smaller than the theoretical value of 2.08  r [ r  ln(2j+1 ) with j=7/2 for the free yb@xmath3 ion ] .",
    "this indicates that the cef levels are well splitted by the tetragonal symmetry .",
    "to conclude , we have observed antiferromagnetic ordering and heavy electron behaviour in yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 using resistivity , magnetization and heat capacity studies . it is interesting to note that both lu@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 and tm@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 are superconducting at 6.2  k and 1.2  k , respectively , while the yb sample did not show superconductivity down to 100 mk . it should be noted here that the superconducting tm@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 compound becomes reentrant antiferromagnet at 1.1  k and remains in the same state down to 50 mk .",
    "we believe that the absence of superconductivity in yb sample is due to the kondo effect , which is quite strong in suppressing the superconductivity .",
    "the magnetic ordering temperature of yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 is also higher than that of the tm compound which implies an ehanced exchange in the former .",
    "here , it is the fe - neighbors , which provide a very strong d - f hybridization , and the si - neighbors , which provide a significant p - f hybridization . in view of the large effect of pressure on the properties of tm@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 , similar studies are essential on yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 to induce superconductivity via quenching of the kondo effect .",
    "such studies are in progress and they will be reported elsewhere .",
