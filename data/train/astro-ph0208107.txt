    "detection of diffuse gamma rays from the galactic plane is considered to be a promising way to understand spatial distributions of cosmic - ray acceleration regions , of interstellar matter ( ism ) , and interstellar photon field ( ispf ) densities .",
    "experimental data in the energy region below 10 gev with the egret instrument @xcite , are fairly well interpreted in terms of interactions of cosmic - ray hadrons and electrons with ism and ispf . however , a portion of the contribution of each elementary process of interaction is uncertain due to assumed intensities and spectral indices of cosmic - ray hadrons , electrons , and densities of ism and ispf . with experiments in the energy region above 100 gev ,",
    "only upper limits for diffuse gamma - ray intensities have been obtained , and these results provide some constraints on the parameters in the models . in order to constrain the parameter values more severely in this energy region , it is necessary to obtain more observational data .    in the early stage of cosmic - ray astrophysics ,",
    "the production rate of gamma rays by compton scattering of starlight photons by cosmic - ray electrons was calculated by feenberg & primakoff ( 1948 ) , and gamma rays arising from neutral pions through cosmic - ray collision with ism was studied by hayakawa ( 1952 ) .",
    "morrison ( 1958 ) advocated gamma - ray astronomy because of the known production mechanisms and the straight trajectories from the origin .",
    "ginzburg & syrovatskii ( 1964 ) summarized the elementary process for gamma - ray production and discussed diffusion and propagation of cosmic rays in the galactic disc . as a result , it is quite natural to expect gamma rays from the galactic plane , however was twenty years after the pioneering work by feenberg & primakoff ( 1948 ) until the intense band of gamma - ray intensity along the galactic plane was observed with oso  3 @xcite and a balloon - borne detector @xcite .",
    "advanced observations were carried out by detectors borne on sas  2 ( fichtel et al .",
    "1975 ; hartman et al .",
    "1979 ) and cos  b ( mayer - hasselwander et al . 1980 , 1982 ) .",
    "these observations revealed that the intensity profile of high - energy gamma rays is quite relevant to the structure of the galaxy , and have stimulated much theoretical work in gamma - ray astronomy below 10 gev ( see , bertsch et al . 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "a detailed intensity distribution of high - energy gamma rays coming from the galactic plane was given by hunter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) based on egret observations . in the energy region above 1 gev , the gamma - ray intensity from the inner galaxy is higher than the cos  b data by a factor of about 3 .",
    "it is also higher than the conventional model predictions ( e.g. , hunter et al .",
    "1997 ; bertsch et al .",
    "1993 ) by a factor of 1.7 , where the neutral pion production is based on the calculations of stecker ( 1988 ) , assuming the power law proton spectrum with spectral index of 2.75 @xcite .",
    "mori ( 1997 ) showed that the latter discrepancy can not be attributed to a calculation with inaccurate accelerator data on neutral pion production .",
    "it can , however , be interpreted by adopting a harder proton spectral index of 2.45 for the egret excess within a plane thickness of @xmath10 .",
    "webber ( 1999 ) also showed that the egret excess in @xmath11 can be reproduced by assuming a source proton spectral index of 2.25 .    following an indication by schlickeiser ( 1979 ) of the importance of using the klein - nishina cross section , protheroe & wolfendale ( 1980 ) showed possible dominance of inverse compton ( ic ) gamma rays over neutral - pion decay gamma rays for a range of electron injection spectra .",
    "detailed calculations of ic gamma rays above 50 mev were made by chi et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , which were more than 50 % of the total diffuse intensity at a medium galactic latitude of @xmath12 .",
    "porter & protheroe ( 1997 ) indicated that in such a high - energy region , cosmic - ray electrons may create a significant part of the diffuse gamma rays , depending on their injection spectral index and acceleration cutoff energy .",
    "pohl & esposito ( 1998 ) remarked that most of radio synchrotron spectra of snrs are well represented by power law indices around 0.5 , corresponding to an electron injection index of about 2.0 @xcite .",
    "they argued that if this injection electron index is employed , the egret excess above 1 gev can be well explained by ic scattering .",
    "they also argued that an electron injection index of 2.0 is within the expected poisson fluctuations and is reasonable in the direction toward the galactic center with the line of sight passing through the vicinity of many snrs , taking into account the diffusion coefficient and the observed local electron index of around 3.0 below 1 tev .",
    "recently , the energy spectrum of local electrons has been obtained with balloon - borne instruments heat @xcite and bets @xcite .",
    "some models of diffuse galactic gamma - ray continuum radiation below 10 gev were synthetically discussed by strong , moskalenko , & reimer ( 2000 ) with respect to the injection spectra , including a harder nucleon and electron spectral indices , and also with respect to different ism and ispf densities . at the higher energies of the tev - pev region , the diffuse gamma - ray emission was calculated by berezinsky et al .",
    "( 1993 ) in terms of cosmic - ray interaction with ism , and also by ingelman & thunman ( 1996 ) using the current models for high energy particle interaction .",
    "broad - band diffuse gamma - ray emission , covering the mev - pev region , was comprehensively calculated by aharonian & atoyan ( 2001 ) , and they discussed propagation of hadron and electron components and their injection spectra . assuming that the hadron spectral index is 2.15 ( or 2.0 ) in snrs , berezhko & v@xmath13lk ( 2000 ) showed that the averaged contribution to the diffuse gamma - ray flux should exceed the current model predictions ( hunter et al .",

    "the number of events that hit these inner areas are tabulated also in table 1 in the last column .",
    "those air shower events are assigned to the sky regions from which they arrived , of 4@xmath30 bin 90 ( 36 ) belts along the galactic plane in equatorial coordinates both for the tibet - ii and tibet - iii array data .",
    "figure 3 shows 10@xmath14 bin warped belts for ig with the declination range of @xmath31 and og with @xmath32 .",
    "these declination ranges of the on - plane belts in the equatorial coordinates correspond to parts of a convex lens shape , with a maximum thickness of about 4@xmath14 or 10@xmath14 in galactic coordinates , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the primary reason those warped belts are employed is to detect gamma - ray signals as accurately as possible if they are emitted from the galactic plane with greater intensity than from other sky regions .",
    "in addition , the zenith angle distribution , and hence the primary energies of detected air showers are quite similar in each warped belt .",
    "this is very important doing the estimation of the on - plane background intensity at the same energy for both the on - plane and many off - plane belts , because the gamma - ray energy spectrum is still unknown .",
    "the final reason is that the background estimate , especially for the og , is little affected by the ig plane , because the warped belts crossing the ig plane do so diagonally , over a narrow band of longitudes .",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution of the number of events in 4@xmath14 bin warped belts .",
    "the abscissa represents the right ascension of each warped belt at the declination 30@xmath14 , which is the same as the latitude of the yangbajing site .",
    "the solid lines are the curves fitted to the experimental data , ignoring the on - plane data . in this figure ,",
    "the cases for ( a ) ig and ( b ) og in the tibet - iii data at 3 tev and ( c ) ig and ( d ) og in the tibet - ii data at 10 tev are shown in the 4@xmath14 bin analysis .",
    "the anisotropy of cosmic - ray intensity seen in this figure , with an amplitude of less than @xmath331% , is mainly due to some seasonal long suspensions of operation for construction and system calibration of the array , and partly due to weather conditions and a slight , 1@xmath14 or less , inclination of the site at yangbajing .",
    "an excess of the on - plane data above the fitted curve would be considered to be a gamma - ray signal .",
    "the signal strength is measured by a standard deviation of the number of showers , in two or five 2@xmath14 bin belts , by the formula @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of on - plane events and @xmath36 is the estimated number of background events in the on - plane region .",
    "@xmath36 is estimated from the solid curve which is obtained by the fitting of many 2@xmath14 bin off - plane belts , ignoring the central 16@xmath14 or 14@xmath14 widths corresponding to the 4@xmath14 bin or 10@xmath14 bin belt analyses .",
    "we intend to deduce the number of on - plane background events as accurately as possible from this fitting curve of the off - plane data .",
    "the number of events shown by the solid curve in each subfigure of fig . 4 is assumed to be due to galactic cosmic rays . in this method",
    ", an isotropic extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray component can not be distinguished from the galactic cosmic rays .",
    "we assume that the intensity of the isotropic component is negligible in comparison with the diffuse gamma rays from the galactic plane .",
    "figure 5 shows the deviation distributions of the number of events from the fitted curves ( the solid ones in fig .",
    "4 ) in 2@xmath14 bin off - plane belts for ( a ) ig and ( b ) og in the tibet - iii data at 3 tev and ( c ) ig and ( d ) og in the tibet - ii data at 10 tev , respectively , in the case of the 4@xmath14 bin analysis . here , the abscissa represents a significance in the 2@xmath14 bin off - plane belts .",
    "the solid curves are best - fit gaussians with standard deviations of 0.998 , 1.007 , 0.999 and 1.000 , respectively , and where data on the 12@xmath14 width centered at the galactic plane are excluded . in the case of the 10@xmath14 bin analysis , almost the same distributions are obtained ; their standard deviations are 1.018 , 1.007 , 1.013 and 1.000 , respectively . because the fluctuation of the number of events around the fitted curve in the off - plane belts is quite natural ,",
    "i.e. each standard deviation is almost equal in unity , the solid curves are considered to be satisfactorily fitted to the experimental data .",
    "thus , we can accurately estimate the number of on - plane background events .",
    "the diffuse gamma - ray intensity from the og plane is likely to be much lower than that from the ig plane .",
    "the well known gamma - ray point source , the crab nebula , is located at @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) with a real angle distance of 5.78@xmath14 from the central sheet of the og plane .",
    "the crab is in the off - plane belt adjacent to the on - plane belt in the 10@xmath14 bin analysis . in the 4@xmath14 bin analysis",
    ", the crab is located between the on - plane and off - plane regions but nearer to the latter .",
    "for that reason , we omit the two 2@xmath14 bin warped belts from the off - plane region . as a result , the data in the 8 warped belts , @xmath39 , are excluded from the background estimation in the 4@xmath14 bin analysis , while the 7 warped belts , @xmath40 , are excluded in the 10@xmath14 bin analysis .",
    "thus , the real angle distance of the crab is 4.21@xmath14 from the on - plane region and 2.22@xmath14 from the newly defined off - plane region in the 4@xmath14 bin analysis , and 1.82@xmath14 and 1.40@xmath14 in the 10@xmath14 bin analysis .",
    "therefore , the crab is located sufficiently far from both the on - plane and off - plane regions , because the angular resolutions of the tibet - iii at 3 tev and the tibet - ii at 10 tev are both about 0.9@xmath14 .    in order to see the adequacy of the fitting and on - plane excess in more detail , smaller ranges of the right ascension band of about 50@xmath14 around the galactic plane",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "4 . in each subfigure",
    ", the on - plane and off - plane data are indicated by filled circles and filled triangles , respectively , and the blank squares indicate the data points excluded from the background estimation .",
    "error bars are statistical only .",
    "it is noted that the error bars are short in the subfigure ( b ) because the ordinate scale is compressed by about half compared to the other subfigures .",
    "the significance of an on - plane excess , @xmath34 measured in standard deviation of the number of on - plane events , is calculated for each distribution shown in fig .",
    "6 and the results are summarized in table 2 . in table 2 , the results thus obtained are given for the regions of ig ( @xmath0 ) and og ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "mode energies 3 tev and 10 tev indicate the analyses of the tibet - iii and tibet - ii data , respectively . as given in this table , no significant excess is found , although an excess of + 2.52 @xmath41 is marginal for ig at 3 tev in the 4@xmath14 bin analysis of the tibet - iii data .",

    "the present data are also not sufficient to rule out the ic model with a spectral index of 2.0 .",
    "next we discuss some considerations regarding our method of data analysis and its results .",
    "first , a difference of the average shower size between gamma - ray and proton initiated showers with the same energy at the yangbajing site ( 606 g@xmath5 ) will produce different initial proton and gamma - ray energies for the same observed shower size . by employing the subroutine package genas of kasahara & torii ( 1991 ) , the average incident gamma - ray energy",
    "is roughly estimated to be lower by 18% at 3 tev and lower by 23% at 10 tev than that for protons of the same shower size , taking the median zenith angle 24.1@xmath14 ( atmospheric depth 664 g@xmath5 ) into account for generally observed shower events .",
    "the median zenith angles are 27.2@xmath14 and 22.8@xmath14 ( 681 g@xmath5 and 657 g@xmath5 ) for the showers arriving from the inner and outer galactic plane , respectively .",
    "thus , the energy decline rate in gamma - initiated showers is somewhat reduced for the ig plane and magnified a little for the og plane . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral index of the diffuse gamma rays is probably smaller than the 2.7 of the galactic cosmic rays at energies around 10 tev .",
    "this produces an opposite offset of the observed gamma - ray energy . which shifts to a higher value , depending on the spectral index .",
    "if the gamma - ray spectral index is 2.4 , as assumed in the derivation of the intensity upper limit in table 2 , gamma - ray energy goes up about 10% or more .",
    "the effects just described act to offset each other .",
    "thus we use the observed energies , 3 tev for the tibet - iii and 10 tev for the tibet - ii , for the primary energies determined for the generally observed air showers at yangbajing site .",
    "second , the sky regions searched for galactic diffuse gamma rays have a shape like a convex lens along the galactic plane as shown in fig .",
    "such a lens shaped region is inevitable in our method , employing the warped belts along the galactic plane in equatorial coordinates .",
    "the maximum thickness of the lens is 3.6@xmath14 or 8.9@xmath14 , but the simple mean of the range used is 3.5@xmath14 or 8.7@xmath14 for ig and 2.7@xmath14 or 6.8@xmath14 for og in the 4@xmath14 bin and 10@xmath14 bin analyses , respectively .",
    "taking the number density of events into account , the weighted mean thickness becomes 3.5@xmath14 or 8.7@xmath14 for ig and 2.9@xmath14 or 7.2@xmath14 for og , respectively .",
    "as already described , the data in the two 2@xmath14 bin belts has been excluded from the off - plane region for og in order to minimize the influence of the crab nebula .",
    "other strong gamma - ray sources , geminga ( @xmath70 ) and ic443 ( @xmath71 ) are involved in the on - plane region of the og plane in the 10@xmath14 bin analysis .",
    "no tev gamma - ray signal has , however , been obtained from these candidate sources by any surface air shower arrays or cherenkov telescopes .",
    "therefore , no correction for the influence of these candidates is necessary .",
    "third , according to the egret data @xcite with @xmath2 , gamma - ray intensity shows a decline in the galactic longitude region from @xmath72 to @xmath73 in ig for every energy ranges , 30 - 100 mev , 100 - 300 mev , 300 - 1000 mev and above 1000 mev .",
    "this tendency is also seen in sas-2 and cos - b data ( see bertsch et al .",
    "the intensity shows a rather flat top in the central range , @xmath74 . in our analysis ,",
    "the inner galactic region is located just at this region of declining intensity .",
    "the whipple @xcite and hegra @xcite data also lie partially in this region , at around @xmath75 . if the intensity decline around 1 gev is caused by the density distribution of ispf , it is expected that the gamma - ray intensity shows similar behavior in the tev region .",
    "we should compare the experimental data with the reduced intensity of about 80 % of the theoretical curves , which have been calculated for the central flat top region .",
    "this is the reason that the experimental data are not sufficient to rule out the inverse compton model with a source spectral index of 2.0 .",
    "theoretical calculations give an indication that , if the source electron spectral index in the 10 gev to 10 tev energy region is smaller than 2.4 , the diffuse gamma rays in the tev region are mainly generated by ic scattering . in that case",
    ", it is essential to fix the diffuse gamma - ray intensity to determine the source electron spectrum in the galactic plane .",
    "this can suggest the strength of shock acceleration , and clarifies the electron propagation process in the galactic disc through a comparison with the direct observation of local electrons , and also gives an estimate of average magnetic field in the source region by examining the consistency with the radio synchrotron intensity .",
    "the extension of the tibet - iii array is expected to be completed by the end of 2002 ; its effective inner area will become about 1.5 times larger than at present , and 1.15 times larger than the tibet - ii inner area .",
    "if the new tibet - iii array continues for running three years without long suspension , statistics will increase to 4 - 5 times the present data at both 3 tev and 10 tev .",
    "the resulting statistical reduction in the upper limits , by a factor of 2 or more , will be more closely comparable with theoretical models , and can also give a significant upper limit at even higher energies , e.g. , at 20 tev , where the upper limit is relatively more sensitive to the acceleration energy cutoff in the ic model .",
    "this work is supported in part by grants - in - aid for scientific research on priority areas from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology in japan and from the committee of the natural science foundation and the academy of sciences in china .",
