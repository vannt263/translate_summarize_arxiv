    "this gives a recursive procedure to compute maximal disk packings , which relies on the enumeration of ( three  connected ) planar or toroidal graphs and a computation of their jammed representations which form a subset of the stable representations .",
    "practically , we generate the stable representations with a variant of the minover algorithm @xcite which appears to always converge to a stable solution , on the plane , torus , and on the sphere .",
