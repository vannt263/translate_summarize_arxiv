    "interdisciplinary efforts in network science have considerably deepened our understanding about the structure and dynamics of the society @xcite .",
    "this active development of the field is largely attributed to the huge amount of digital information that has become available due to rapid development of the information and communication technology ( ict ) .",
    "many empirical studies have been conducted on social networks including those based on email @xcite , mobile phone call ( mpc ) @xcite , short - message communication , social networking services ( sns ) @xcite , and scientific collaborations @xcite . among these",
    ", mpc data sets play a special role because mobile phones are frequently used in our daily life and the coverage of the service is almost 100% for adults in large part of the world . as a matter of fact , an analysis of the mpc data set @xcite has been successful in validating the `` strength of weak ties '' hypothesis proposed by granovetter @xcite , stating that if the tie between two persons is strong , then the overlap between their neighbors will be large .",
    "this has far - reaching consequences for the overall structure of the social network : it suggests that the network consists of strongly wired communities connected by weak ties .",
    "this structure was proven at a societal level by applying percolation analysis to a social network , in which the duration of a phone call between two individuals serves as a proxy for their social tie strength .",
    "hereafter we will refer to these networks as having granovetterian structure .",
    "this led to the attempts to constructing a model of social network formation reflecting the observed structures @xcite .",
    "more recently , this model was generalized to reflect the multiplex character of social networks @xcite .    in the original model by kumpula et al",
    "@xcite two main mechanisms for the link - formation process were introduced , namely cyclic and focal closures , as they have been empirically observed to be the fundamental mechanisms for creating social ties @xcite . here",
    "the cyclic closure describes the formation of a link with the neighbor of one s network neighbor or , in other words , with a friend of a friend .",
    "the focal closure refers to making a link with the one sharing an attribute independently of the local network topology or geodesic distance between the individuals .",
    "in addition to these two mechanisms , a link reinforcement was introduced to correspond to the general observation that social ties get stronger when they are used .",
    "while in the previous studies the cyclic and focal closure mechanisms have been shown to play an important role in generating a granovetterian structure , much less is known about the role of the process in which a relationship becomes terminated . in the original model @xcite nodes ( and all their links ) were removed with a small probability or with a slow rate and new nodes without any links were added to the system to replace them . this way the asymptotic stationarity of the system with some average degree",
    "could be maintained .",
    "deletion of a node corresponds to the death of a person or giving up a service or moving far away so that all contacts break . in real human society , however , the termination of a relationship may occur in various ways and there is no empirical support that the deletion of a node would be the main mechanism for terminating links . even without a removal of a person , a relationship may end abruptly , for example , when a couple in intimate relationship suddenly break up .",
    "according to an empirical study , an individual drops out one member of her relationships every @xmath0 months on average  @xcite . apart from these rather sudden and drastic changes in human relationships , there is also a more gradual fading out of a friendship , which is typically seen when old but aging friends make less and less contact by time .",
    "it is not clear whether such difference in tie terminations affects the emergent network properties . in this paper , we investigate the effects of various link termination mechanisms and show that the link aging may lead to a significantly different network from the one with abrupt link termination or link deletion .",
    "the comparison between the models with different link termination mechanisms indicates that the link deletion reproduces the empirical findings from the mpc data set better than other mechanisms , implying that a link deletion plays a prominent role in the evolution of social networks among the link termination mechanisms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we define the models with three different link termination mechanisms , including the original node deletion mechanism .",
    "then we demonstrate that modular structures are more enhanced under the link aging than other mechanisms .",
    "various local network features , such as degree distributions , link weight distributions , and link overlap , are investigated and compared with the mpc data set . finally , we present summary and discussion in the last section .",
    "first we briefly review the original weighted social network model proposed in @xcite .",
    "it considers an undirected weighted network of @xmath1 nodes , with links between them being updated by the following three mechanisms .",
    "the first mechanism is _ local attachment _ ( la ) , in which node @xmath2 chooses one of its neighbors @xmath3 with probability proportional to @xmath4 that stands for the weight of the link between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "then node @xmath3 chooses one of its neighbors but @xmath2 , say @xmath5 , randomly with probability proportional to @xmath6 and if nodes @xmath2 and @xmath5 are not connected , they are connected with probability @xmath7 with a link of weight @xmath8 .",
    "in addition all the involved links increase the weights by @xmath9 , whether a new link is created or not .",
    "the second mechanism is _ global attachment _ ( ga ) , in which a node with no links or otherwise with probability @xmath10 makes a new link to a randomly chosen node with weight @xmath8 .",
    "the third mechanism is _ node deletion _ ( nd ) , in which a node loses all its links with probability @xmath11 , equivalently to replacing the node with a new isolated node .",
    "these three processes , i.e. , la , ga , and nd , are applied to all nodes at each time step .",
    "the initial condition is set to be a network without any links and the network reaches a statistically stationary state after a sufficient number of updates .",
    "this model turned out to show the granovetterian structure of the society with strongly wired communities connected by weak ties .    in this paper",
    "we extend the original model such that instead of nd , we consider two different link termination mechanisms : _ link deletion _ ( ld ) and _ aging_. in case of link deletion we assume an abrupt termination of links , such that each link is removed from the system with probability @xmath12 at each time step . here",
    "we assume this probability to be independent of the link weight such that even a strong link can be suddenly terminated .",
    "in contrast , for the link aging mechanism we assume a gradual degradation of the link weight , such that at each time step , weights of all the links are multiplied by an aging factor @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , where @xmath13 controls the speed of aging .",
    "if the link weight becomes less than a threshold value , @xmath15 , the link is removed from the system . from now on , models with nd , ld , and aging mechanisms will be called the nd model , ld model , and aging model , respectively .",
    "in figure  [ fig : snapshot ] we show for comparison typical snapshots of the networks for three different link termination mechanisms with similar average degree .",
    "all the networks show modular structures , where the links connecting communities are typically weaker than the intra - community links , thus indicating the existence of the granovetterian structure",
    ". however , the strength of the modularity varies significantly .",
    "the aging model shows clearly the strongest modularity among three networks while the ld model shows less modular structure than the others .",
    "another interesting finding for the aging model is that the link weights within a community are more homogeneous .",
    "furthermore , typical link weight in a community is inversely correlated with the community size .",
    "this is contrasting to the other models , where each community has both weak and strong links . in the following ,",
    "we investigate these observations quantitatively .    ) .",
    "color of links denotes the link weight .",
    "strong and weak links are depicted in red and light blue , respectively .",
    "note that different color scales are used for visibility .",
    "for the aging mechanism , community structures are clearly visible and the link weights in each community are more homogeneous . in the networks using the nd and ld mechanisms , strong and weak links coexist in each community . ]",
    "here we performed simulations by setting @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "for the nd model with @xmath21 a typical granovetterian structure is observed @xcite such that the average degree is @xmath22 . in order to compare the results with the ld and aging cases , we control the parameters for the ld and aging models so that average degrees are comparable with that of the nd model .",
    "we adopted @xmath23 for ld model , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for aging model .",
    "note that a higher @xmath10 is used for the aging model , otherwise the fragmentation of the network occurs .",
    "the results were obtained by running the simulations up to @xmath27 time steps and averaging over @xmath28 realizations .",
    "the average degrees and other quantities are summarized in table [ table : degrees ] .",
    "we note that qualitatively similar results are observed for reasonable ranges of parameters other than those specified above .    .",
    "* average degrees , clustering coefficients , and maximum modularity . *",
    "the average degree @xmath29 , global clustering coefficient @xmath30 , maximum modularity for binary graph @xmath31 are summarized for the nd , ld and aging models together with the simulation parameters .",
    "relative fluctuations of link weights in each community , @xmath32 , are also presented . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have investigated how the mechanism of link termination affects the emerging network structures by introducing and comparing three different models , namely node deletion ( nd ) , link deletion ( ld ) , and aging models .",
    "first of all , we would like to emphasize that the granovetterian structure is robustly observed for all three models .",
    "it supports the observation by the previous studies that cyclic and focal closures play key roles in generating the granovetterian structure .",
    "on the other hand , there are significant differences between the nd , ld and aging models .",
    "we find that aging promotes modular structure in networks having the granovetterian structure .",
    "this is because inter - community weak links are often deleted while strong links existing within communities need a longer time to be removed , thus making the communities more persistent under the aging than under nd or ld .",
    "it is also notable that the aging makes link weights in each community more homogeneous .",
    "in contrast , with link deletions assumed in the nd or ld models communities are less modular and links have variable weights . with the ld model",
    "it is even harder to maintain high modularity than with the nd model because the density of links in a community tends to decrease more rapidly with ld .    local network properties for these three models , such as degree distribution , node strength distribution , and link overlaps ,",
    "have also been investigated and compared with the mpc data set observations .",
    "the results show that the nd and ld models reproduce the mpc data set while the aging model shows different profiles due to its highly modular structure with homogeneous links .",
    "this implies that abrupt link deletion is the major mechanism for deleting ties in real society , while link aging , being presumably present , plays a minor role .",
    "the difference between the nd and ld models are less clear , but we think that the ld model describes the reality better than the nd model . degree and node strength distributions for the ld model do not show a monotonically decaying behavior but have peaks at characteristic scales .",
    "this matches better to our common sense that each person has some amount of resources devoted to communication although we do not have conclusive evidence from empirical data yet .",
    "furthermore , an empirical analysis has shown that the relationships terminate with a significant rate even with individuals who have had a long term relationship @xcite .",
    "thus , the ld model would be a good starting point for a simple model of social networks .    in this paper , we have focused on non - overlapping communities but in reality , the communities may be overlapping as discussed in @xcite . in order to realize such overlapping communities ,",
    "we have recently proposed a multilayer model , where the network in each layer is generated in a similar way to the original weighted social network model @xcite . in that case",
    "the node deletion takes place in each layer independently , which corresponds to an event that a node leaves one of its communities .",
    "this may also sound a reasonable assumption since we sometimes lose links not only to a person but collectively to his or her close friends .",
    "although we expect most of the properties investigated in this paper to hold for the multilayer model , further studies on multilayer models would be interesting .    in reality , the link termination process happens in more complicated and various ways and our model is at best a simplification .",
    "although we assume that the link does not recover once it is removed , more than half of the real conflicts are reconciled @xcite . furthermore , the probability of link deletion should also depend on the age of the friendship @xcite . in twitter data set",
    ", it was observed that `` unfollowing '' behavior depends on the local network topology such as reciprocity or existence of common friends @xcite . as these aspects are missing in our models the future investigations on these factors",
    "are expected to make the model even more realistic .",
    "two aspects should be emphasized finally .",
    "first , when we compare our models with data , we have to restrict ourselves to the available sources , which means single channel communication records .",
    "this is an obvious source of bias , as multiple channels are crucial in human communication , which may change some of the statistics qualitatively .",
    "second , the three different mechanisms separately treated here in disjunct models are simultaneously present in a real human society .",
    "the advantage of the present study is that we have gotten insight about their role in the formation of the social network .",

    "in this appendix , a linear stability analysis of the link weight @xmath33 around the equilibrium value @xmath34 for the aging model is demonstrated . in order to evaluate the linear stability of @xmath33 around @xmath34",
    ", we consider the case that one of the links , say the link between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , is stronger than other links by @xmath35 while other links have the same weight as @xmath34 .",
    "the expected amount of reinforcement on the link @xmath36 in one time step , @xmath37 , is given by @xmath38 the first , second , and third terms correspond to the case that the link @xmath36 is selected as the first , second , and third link in one la event , respectively .",
    "la must start from the node @xmath2 or @xmath3 when the link @xmath36 is selected either as the first or the third link , which gives @xmath39 in the first and the third terms .",
    "when the link @xmath36 is selected as the second link , the la event must start from the node except for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which yields the factor @xmath40 in the second term .",
    "if we assume @xmath41 and ignore the higher order terms of @xmath35 , the expected increase @xmath37 is calculated as @xmath42 on the other hand , the expected amount of the decrease due to aging , @xmath43 , is @xmath44 . when @xmath45 , the total change of the link weight is calculated using eq .",
