    "clic  @xcite is a proposed linear collider designed to perform electron - positron collisions at centre - of - mass energies ranging from a few hundred gev up to 3tev , with a luminosity of @xmath3 at the highest energy .",
    "the anticipated physics potential of such a collider is extremely broad .",
    "it ranges from precision tests of the higgs and top sector , to detailed studies of new phenomena , through new particle spectroscopy , coupling measurements , threshold scans , measurement of spins and other quantum numbers .",
    "accurate jet energy reconstruction will be crucial for this physics programme , driving the need for fine - grained calorimeters and the particle flow approach to calorimetry at clic .",
    "this paper describes the performance of high granularity particle flow calorimetry at high energies and with the challenging background conditions present at clic .",
    "these studies build on those first reported in the context of the ilc  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are based on full geant4 simulations of the clic_ild  @xcite detector concept considered in the clic conceptual design report  @xcite .",
    "results for the clic_sid  @xcite detector concept were comparable  @xcite .",
    "many of the interesting physics processes at clic will produce final states containing multiple jets , which may be accompanied by charged leptons and/or missing transverse momentum . in order to perform precision physics measurements , it is vital to be able to reconstruct the invariant masses of the jets ; accurate jet mass measurements are a powerful tool for both reconstruction and identification of physics events .",
    "the goal for jet energy resolution at clic is that it should be sufficient to allow separation of the hadronic decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons through the reconstruction of their di - jet invariant masses .",
    "this sets a challenging jet energy resolution goal of for jets , which is unlikely to be achievable with a traditional approach to calorimetry  @xcite .",
    "measurements of jet fragmentation at lep provide detailed information about the particle composition of jets@xcite . in a typical jet , approximately 62% of the energy",
    "is carried by charged particles ( mainly hadrons ) , whilst 27% is carried by photons , 10% by long - lived neutral hadrons and 1.5% by neutrinos . in a traditional approach to calorimetry",
    ", the jet energy would be obtained from the energies deposited in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters ( ecal and hcal respectively ) .",
    "this means that 72% of the energy of a typical jet would be measured with a precision limited by the relatively poor hcal resolution of    the particle flow approach to calorimetry aims to improve jet energy measurements by reconstructing the four - vectors of all visible particles in an event .",
    "the reconstructed jet energy is then the sum of the energies of the individual particles in the jet . at lep",
    ", aleph used particle flow techniques  @xcite to improve the energy resolution for hadronic events .",
    "however , due to the relatively low granularity of the calorimeters , energy depositions from neutral hadrons still had to be identified as significant excesses of calorimetric energy compared to the associated charged particle tracks .",
    "particle flow techniques are also being used by cms  @xcite at the lhc .",
    "the linear collider detector concepts extend the particle flow approach by using fine - granularity calorimeters and sophisticated software algorithms to accurately trace the individual paths of particles through the detector . the energy and momentum for each particle",
    "can then be determined from the detector subsystem in which the measurements are the most accurate . charged particle momenta are measured in the inner detector tracker , whilst photon energy measurements are extracted from the energy deposited in the ecal , with typical resolution @xmath4 .",
    "the hcal is used to measure only the 10% of jet energy carried by long - lived neutral hadrons .",
    "particle flow calorimetry can therefore offer a significant improvement to jet energy measurements , compared to traditional calorimetry . for jet energies above about 100gev , the jet energy resolution is limited by the mistakes in the assignment of the energies to the different reconstructed particles , termed _",
    "confusion _ , rather than the intrinsic resolution of the calorimeters .",
    "figure  [ eventtopology ] shows the typical topology of a simulated 250gev jet in the clic_ild detector concept , with labels identifying a number of the constituent particles .",
    "the figure shows inner detector tracks , representing the paths of charged particles in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "these tracks can be extrapolated by eye and associated with clusters of calorimeter energy deposits in the fine granularity ecal and hcal .",
    "photons produce energy deposits with characteristic longitudinal and transverse profiles in the ecal and can be cleanly resolved by eye , due to their small transverse spread .",
    "hcal clusters that can not be associated with tpc tracks represent neutral hadrons .",
    "the challenge is to develop software algorithms to automate the reconstruction of the individual particles from the tracks and energy deposits in the calorimeters .    a typical simulated 250gev jet in clic_ild , with labels identifying constituent particles .",
    "]    particle flow calorimetry demands high performance software .",
    "the final jet energy resolution is strongly dependent on both the detector granularity and the quality of the particle flow reconstruction algorithms .",
    "these algorithms must be able to exploit the granularity to merge together energy deposits from individual particles , with minimal confusion .",
    "a logical approach is to implement a series of decoupled pattern - recognition algorithms , each designed to carefully reconstruct a specific particle topology .",
    "the implementation of a large number of efficient pattern - recognition algorithms drives the need for a central software framework , which can take care of memory - management and book - keeping issues .",
    "such a framework helps to keep each algorithm simple and focused on its specific pattern - recognition task .    the pandorapfa c++ software development kit ( sdk )  @xcite for particle flow calorimetry is a robust and efficient framework for developing and running algorithms for particle flow reconstruction .",
    "it consists of a single framework library and a number of carefully designed application programming interfaces ( apis ) .",
    "it was designed with the twin aims of simplifying the development of efficient pattern - recognition algorithms and allowing easy application of existing algorithms to different detectors , different software environments or even different pattern - recognition tasks . using",
    "the pandorapfa sdk means that the pattern - recognition reconstruction is divided into three distinct sections , which communicate via the pandorapfa apis .",
    "a pandorapfa client application uses the apis to pass details of the tracks and calorimeter cells in an event to the pandorapfa framework .",
    "the framework then creates and manages its own lists of self - describing pandorapfa tracks and cells .",
    "these objects are then accessed , in a controlled manner , by the pandorapfa algorithms .",
    "the algorithms control the pattern - recognition reconstruction and determine how the tracks and cells are used to build clusters and , finally , reconstructed particles ( termed particle flow objects , or pfos ) .",
    "importantly , the algorithms can only access or manipulate the pandorapfa objects by using apis to request services from the framework .",
    "typical requests would be to create or delete clusters , merge multiple clusters , split clusters or associate tracks with clusters .",
    "this software engineering approach means that the framework can provide all memory - management and book - keeping operations in an efficient and well - tested manner .",
    "the particle flow reconstruction at clic uses over 60 different pandorapfa algorithms and tools .",
    "these algorithms are efficient and well - understood .",
    "the basic reconstruction operations performed by the default set of pandorapfa algorithms can be summarised as follows :    * calorimeter cells are clustered using a simple cone - based clustering algorithm .",
    "the algorithm works outwards from the innermost cells in the detector , either adding cells to existing clusters or seeding new clusters .",
    "clusters can also be seeded by the projection of inner detector tracks to the front face of the calorimeter . *",
    "the clustering algorithm is configured so as to split up the energy depositions from individual particles , rather than risk merging the depositions from multiple particles .",
    "the resulting cluster fragments are then carefully merged together by a series of algorithms that implement well - motivated topological rules .",
    "* calorimeter clusters are associated to inner detector tracks , by comparing the properties of the clusters ( results of linear fits , helix fits , etc . ) to the projected track positions and directions at the front face of the calorimeter . *",
    "if the energy of a calorimeter cluster does not match the associated track momentum , the clustering can be reconfigured by the statistical reclustering algorithms .",
    "these use a series of differently configured clustering algorithms in order to investigate the possible cluster configurations achievable with the relevant cells and tracks . the cluster configuration offering the best track - cluster compatibility",
    "is selected .",
    "* fragment - removal algorithms aim to remove neutral clusters that are really fragments of charged clusters .",
    "the algorithms search for evidence of association between nearby clusters , whilst also considering the changes in track - cluster compatibility that would occur if the clusters were merged . *",
    "particle flow objects are formed .",
    "if a particle is composed of both tracks and clusters , its properties are extracted from measurements of the tracks . for neutral particles , calorimeter information is used .",
    "* particle identification algorithms are used throughout the reconstruction .",
    "the original ideas for these algorithms are described in more detail in  @xcite . since this publication ,",
    "the algorithms have been re - examined and re - implemented using the pandorapfa sdk .",
    "this new software implementation was used for all the physics performance studies presented in the clic conceptual design report  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated  @xcite that the new implementation achieved identical physics performance , whilst offering sizeable reductions in memory usage and cpu - time requirements .",
    "the re - implementation also offered a number of software engineering improvements , ensuring that the code for each algorithm is simple , efficient and easy to maintain . following the re - implementation of the original algorithms , further development focused on improving the reconstruction of high energy jets ( above 250gev ) in the presence of machine - induced background .",
    "for very high energy jets , the energy deposits from particles within a jet inevitably overlap . in this case",
    "the pure pattern - recognition approach of particle flow reconstruction starts to break down . at this point ,",
    "more emphasis is given to an energy flow approach , based on the consistency of track momenta and associated calorimeter cluster energies .",
    "improvements to the statistical reclustering algorithms ensure a smooth transition from pure particle flow to energy flow .",
    "these statistical reclustering algorithms can now be cleanly divided into the following categories :    * algorithms that deal with multiple inner detector tracks associated to a single calorimeter cluster .",
    "these algorithms must try to split up the cluster . * algorithms that deal with clusters with energies significantly greater than the momentum of their associated inner detector tracks .",
    "these algorithms must also try to split up the clusters .",
    "* algorithms that deal with inner detector tracks with momentum significantly greater than the energy of their associated clusters .",
    "these algorithms must bring in nearby ` neutral ' clusters and reconfigure the division of cells into clusters .    in order to ensure suitable track - cluster compatibility ( an indication that confusion in the reconstruction is minimal ) , associated tracks and clusters must pass algorithms from each of the above categories without requiring modification .",
    "if changes are made , the new track - cluster configuration must also pass the full set of consistency checks .",
    "if , and only if , no consistent track - cluster configuration can be found , a ` forced clustering ' algorithm is used to implement a transition to energy flow calorimetry .",
    "this algorithm selects calorimeter cells along a helix projection of the inner detector track until a new cluster with energy matching the track momentum is formed .",
    "the remnant hits are clustered independently and will typically form neutral particles .",
    "this managed transition to energy flow , which occurs only when algorithms can not find a natural clustering configuration , proves to be important at high jet energies .",
    "further improvements for high energy reconstruction include new algorithms to identify mip - like sections of calorimeter clusters and to track these sections through electromagnetic clusters in the ecal .",
    "improvements to the photon reconstruction have also been made , placing a series of careful selection cuts on ecal clusters to ensure that the clusters match the expected longitudinal and transverse profiles for electromagnetic showers .",
    "finally , particle identification functionality was added to tag photons and charged leptons .",
    "the particle identification information is actively used in the pattern - recognition reconstruction , aiding decisions when considering how to process certain clusters or reconstructed particles .",
    "the experimental environment at clic differs from that at previous @xmath5 colliders such as lep :    * the high bunch - charge density , related to the small beam size at the interaction point , means that the electrons and positrons radiate strongly in the electromagnetic field of the other beam , an effect known as beamstrahlung .",
    "* there are significant beam related backgrounds .",
    "the pile - up of approximately 3.2 multiperipheral @xmath6 `` mini - jet '' events per bunch crossing is an important consideration in particle flow reconstruction at clic . *",
    "the clic beam consists of bunch trains of 312 bunches with a train repetition rate of 50hz . within a bunch train ,",
    "the bunches are separated by 0.5ns .",
    "the short time between bunches means that a detector will inevitably integrate over a number of bunch crossings .",
    "if it is assumed that all detector systems integrate over 10ns , the @xmath6 background corresponds to 1.2tev of energy deposited in the calorimeter systems .",
    "this large background presents a challenge for particle flow reconstruction at clic .",
    "however , the combination of high granularity particle flow reconstruction and timing information can be used to greatly suppress this background .      the pandorapfa algorithms aim to reconstruct the four - vectors of all visible particles in an event .",
    "a jet - finding algorithm can then be used to identify individual jets , with the jet energy reconstructed as the sum of the energies of the reconstructed particles ( pfos ) in the jet . however , in the presence of beam - induced background , it is vital to identify and remove the background particles before the jet - finding stage",
    ". based on full geant4 simulation studies , a realistic strategy for mitigating the effects of background was developed .",
    "this is based on the reconstructed @xmath7 of the individual pfos and timing information . in these studies",
    "a 1ns timing resolution was assumed for hits in the calorimeters and all calorimeter and tracker hits within a 10ns window , starting at the bunch crossing containing the physics event , were included in the reconstruction . following the reconstruction of inner detector tracks , a clictrackselector event processor was used to remove poor quality and fake tracks from events reconstructed in the presence of background .",
    "this processor examines the number of track hits in each of the tracking subdetectors and applies simple quality cuts .",
    "it also places a cut on the arrival time of the tracked particle at the front face of the calorimeter .",
    "tracks are rejected if the arrival time , calculated using a helix fit to the track , differs by more than 50ns from a simple straight - line time - of - flight calculation .",
    "the clictrackselector is an important tool for background suppression and is used whenever background is added to an event and whenever any background suppression cuts are applied .",
    "the main benefit of particle flow reconstruction is that it clusters the calorimetric energy in the detector into individual particles , which can then be identified as being from background or from the underlying hard interaction .",
    "because hadronic showers take a finite time to develop , it is not possible to simply place very tight timing requirements on the individual hits prior to the reconstruction .",
    "instead , the strategy is to perform particle flow reconstruction and then use the properties of the pfos to either reject or retain the pfo . each calorimeter cluster associated with a reconstructed pfo",
    "contains many individual hits .",
    "the hits are distributed in time due to the assumed time resolution and the development time of the shower .",
    "furthermore , the clusters may contain hits from more than one particle ; this is particularly important for the forward region , where the background from @xmath6 is the greatest . for these reasons ,",
    "timing cuts are applied at the cluster level using a robust mean of the individual hit times .",
    "the cluster time is calculated by first determining the median time of all hits in the cluster and then ignoring the times of the outlying 10% of hits .",
    "the times of the remaining hits are used to calculate an energy - weighted mean value , which is assigned to the cluster .",
    "if a cluster contains sufficient ecal hits , only ecal hits are considered in this calculation . with a single hit resolution of approximately 1ns , mean",
    "cluster times with an accuracy much better than 1ns are obtained .",
    "the pfos from the physics event have a range of @xmath7 values and have times close to @xmath8 , where @xmath8 is the time of the bunch crossing containing the event ; identified in the high - level software trigger .",
    "the pfos from the @xmath6 background tend to be at lower values of @xmath7 and are distributed in time across the 10ns reconstruction window .",
    "these two features allow background pfos to be separated from signal pfos .",
    "this is only made possible by the highly granular calorimeters . in a more conventional calorimeter , the energy deposits from signal and background would overlap .",
    "figure  [ fig : pte ] shows the @xmath7 and time distributions for photon and neutral hadron pfos in the endcap regions , for both signal and background .",
    "the two variables are largely independent",
    ". as expected , the time distribution for background photon pfos is essentially flat .",
    "the reason that the background neutral hadron pfos tend to peak at 5ns is that the reconstructed clusters are often composed of energy deposits from multiple background particles , which is also reflected in the harder energy spectrum .",
    "the pfo time and @xmath7 distributions for reconstructed photon and neutral hadron pfos .",
    "the solid histograms show the distributions for events at @xmath9 and the dashed histograms show the distribution for pile - up from @xmath6 .",
    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the optimal treatment of the background is likely to depend on the physics process being studied .",
    "for example , for final state processes which result in forward jets , harder timing cuts are likely to be beneficial .",
    "for this reason sets of background rejection cuts were developed .",
    "cuts were only applied in the regions of @xmath7 and time where there was a significant background component , @xmath10gev for photon and charged pfos and @xmath11 for neutral hadrons .",
    "tighter cuts were applied in the far forward region , @xmath12 , where background pfos tend to be formed from energy deposits from multiple background particles .",
    "tighter timing cuts were applied to pfos with @xmath13gev where there is a large contribution from background .",
    "the initial loose timing cuts , within the different @xmath7 regions , were chosen to have minimal impact on pfos from @xmath14 jets .",
    "subsequently the cuts were optimised by modifying the timing cuts for each type of pfo in steps of 0.5ns .",
    "the final version of the clicpfoselector algorithm has three available configurations , which apply ` default ` , ` loose ` and ` tight ` cuts to the pfos .",
    "the selection cuts for the ` loose ` and ` tight ` configurations are listed in table  [ tab : pfoselection ] .",
    "the ` tight ` cuts also include the requirements that @xmath15 for photon pfos and @xmath16 for neutral hadron pfos ; these additional cuts were found to be more effective than further tightening the timing cuts .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table  [ tabwz_sep ] summarises the mass resolutions obtained for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 samples and the separation achieved and the identification efficiency for each of the different energies investigated . the separation of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 peaks is quantified by determining the fraction of mis - identified events for the optimum mass cut .",
    "the natural widths of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons restrict the identification efficiency to @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of mis - identified events is converted into an equivalent gaussian statistical separation , where for example , in the case of ideal gaussian distributions , a mis - identification of 15.8% corresponds to a separation of 2@xmath18 . without background a @xmath19 separation of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mass peaks",
    "is essentially maintained for gauge bosons with energies between 125gev and 1tev .",
    "this separation is reduced to about @xmath20 when background is included . even without the background",
    ", it would be exceedingly difficult to achieve such a level of separation ( over such a wide range of jet energies ) using a traditional approach to calorimetry .",
    "the successful use of particle flow calorimetry to separate hadronic @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays in a physics analysis is demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of missing momentum is important in many physics processes . here ,",
    "the performance of the particle flow reconstruction of missing momentum is quantified in two ways : i ) the missing momentum resolution for events with a true missing momentum signature ; and ii ) the reconstructed missing momentum in event topologies where the momentum of the reconstructed particles should balance .",
    "the missing transverse momentum resolution was quantified using the simulated events discussed in section  [ sec : ww ] .",
    "the jet reconstruction was unchanged , and the only event selection requirement was that both jets satisfy @xmath21 .",
    "the missing momentum depends on both the energies of the neutrinos and their polar angles . for this reason",
    "the four different energy points , @xmath22=250 , 500 , 1000 and 2000gev , were combined into a single data set .",
    "the missing transverse momentum , @xmath23 , was calculated from the vector sum of the momenta of all the particles in the two reconstructed jets .",
    "this was compared to the generated missing transverse momentum of the two neutrinos , @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ figmet_distr ] shows the distribution of the difference between measured and true missing transverse momentum ( for all events combined ) and the missing transverse momentum resolution as a function of the true @xmath7 in the event . for each bin in @xmath7 ,",
    "the missing transverse energy resolution was obtained by calculating the rms@xmath25 of the @xmath26 distribution and dividing by the true missing transverse momentum .",
    "the resolutions obtained indicate that the missing transverse momentum can be measured with an asymptotic precision of about 3% for @xmath27 .",
    "many physics analyses rely on measurements of missing momentum .",
    "fake missing momentum can result from limitations in the detector coverage and from the mis - reconstruction of the momenta of the particles .",
    "the fake missing momentum was quantified using the events described in section  [ sec : technicalstudy ] .",
    "the events were reconstructed into three jets , to account for the possibility of a single hard gluon radiation .",
    "figure  [ figfmet_distr ] shows the distribution of the @xmath28 component of the fake missing momentum for the 91gev @xmath29 sample .",
    "the resolution was quantified by calculating the rms@xmath25 of this distribution .",
    "the right hand plot of figure  [ figfmet_distr ] shows that the rms@xmath25 rises approximately linearly with the total energy deposited in the detector .",
    "overall , the level of fake missing transverse momentum ( in one coordinate ) is at the level of 1 - 2% of the event energy .",
    "the impact of the @xmath6 background is not large for the event energies of interest at clic .",
    "particle flow calorimetry is an extremely powerful technique , which can deliver unprecedented energy and mass resolutions at future linear colliders , even in the challenging environment at clic .",
    "the pandorapfa particle flow algorithm now offers an accurate particle flow reconstruction at jet energies from 50gev to 1.5tev , and includes a managed transition to energy flow calorimetry if calorimeter occupancies become exceptionally high .",
    "following the particle flow reconstruction , timing cuts can be applied to reconstructed particles to significantly reduce the contribution of beam - induced backgrounds .",
    "the energy dependence of the particle flow reconstruction , and the systematic effects of detector acceptance , have been investigated via a study of mono - energetic jets with energies up to 1.5tev .",
    "two physics channels , providing @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles , were then chosen to study the performance of particle flow calorimetry with jet reconstruction and in the presence of background .",
    "the energy and mass resolutions achieved are very promising . at higher energies ,",
    "the effect of the @xmath6 background on the energy resolution is negligible .",
    "the mass resolution is more sensitive to the quality of the reconstructed jets , and so is more strongly affected by backgrounds , but the separation of hadronic @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays remains achievable .",
    "even though pandorapfa is not optimised for the reconstruction of missing momentum , it allows missing transverse momentum to be measured with the same precision as jet energies .",
    "the level of fake missing transverse momentum ( in one coordinate ) is at the level of 1 - 2% of the event energy .",
    "compared to previous results , obtained in  @xcite , significant perfomance improvements have been achieved with the pandorapfa algorithms , especially for higher jet energies .",
    "these improvements are evident in the jet energy resolution and in the ability to distinguish between the hadronic decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles",
    ". the pandorapfa reconstruction has been used for all the simulated physics studies presented in the clic conceptual design report  @xcite .",
