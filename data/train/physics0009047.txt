    "in high - energy storage rings , electron ( positron ) beams can become transversely polarized through the emission of synchrotron radiation  @xcite .",
    "this process involves a small asymmetry in the spin - flip amplitudes , which enhances the population of the spin state antiparallel ( parallel ) to the magnetic bending field .",
    "the polarization develops in time according to @xmath0 where the asymptotic polarization @xmath1 and the time constant @xmath2 are characteristics of the ring conditions . in the absence of depolarizing effects , the maximum polarization theoretically achievable is @xmath3 , and the rise - time constant , which depends on the bending radius of the storage ring and the beam energy , is @xmath4  min for the hera storage ring operated at an energy @xmath5  gev .",
    "depolarizing effects can however substantially reduce the maximum achievable polarization .",
    "these intricate effects can not generally be precisely controlled , making it necessary to continuously measure the beam polarization .",
    "the depolarizing effects also affect the actual rise - time , which scales with @xmath1 according to @xmath6 thus for a typical beam polarization of 0.55 , the rise - time is about 22  min .",
    "this article describes a polarization monitor at the hera electron ring at desy , which is based on compton scattering of circularly polarized photons from an intense pulsed laser beam .",
    "this method for measuring the polarization of stored electron beams was suggested more than 30 years ago  @xcite , and has been employed at many laboratories  @xcite to measure the transverse polarization .",
    "compton scattering has also been employed at linear accelerators  @xcite to measure the longitudinal polarization . in recent years",
    ", the nikhef  @xcite and mit - bates  @xcite laboratories have developed compton polarimeters to monitor the longitudinal beam polarization in their storage rings . at desy ,",
    "a compton polarimeter  @xcite had been constructed in 1992 to measure the transverse polarization of the electron beam in the hera west section .",
    "this transverse polarimeter measured the electron beam polarization with an initial fractional systematic uncertainty of 9% , which has subsequently been improved to 3.4%  @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal compton polarimeter was added to obtain an independent and more precise measurement of the beam polarization at hera , with very different systematic uncertainties and the capability to measure individual bunch polarizations .",
    "it was commissioned during fall 1996 , and provides a measurement of the longitudinal beam polarization in the east section of hera between the spin rotators  @xcite at the hermes experiment  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for compton scattering of circularly polarized photons off longitudinally polarized electrons can be written  @xcite in the laboratory frame as    @xmath7 , \\label{eq : sigma}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the unpolarized cross section , @xmath9 is the energy of the back - scattered compton photons , @xmath10 is the circular polarization of the incident photons for the two helicity states @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam , and @xmath13 is the longitudinal asymmetry function , which is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : analyzing - power.eps ] for a 2.33  ev photon scattered off a 27.5  gev electron .",
    "the total unpolarized cross section is 377  mb , and the differential cross section is peaked at the maximum energy ( @xmath14  gev ) of the back - scattered compton photons , hereafter called the compton edge .",
    "the longitudinal asymmetry function has a maximum of about 0.60 at the compton edge .",
    "as the energy of the compton photons decreases , @xmath15 decreases rapidly and becomes negative below 9.1  gev , corresponding to scattering angles smaller than @xmath16 in the electron rest frame , and returns to zero at @xmath17 .",
    "due to the enormous kinematic boost from the electron beam ( the lorentz factor is @xmath18 ) , most back - scattered compton photons are contained in a narrow cone centered around the initial direction of the struck electrons .",
    "this is very advantageous to a polarization monitor because it allows the detector to be far away ( many tens of meters ) from the interaction region .",
    "however , the spatial distribution of the compton photons on the detector surface is given not only by the compton kinematics but also by the electron beam optics .",
    "therefore , if the interaction point is chosen at a position where the divergence of the electron beam is small , the transverse size of the photon detector can be sufficiently small to accommodate only moderate separations of the compton photons and the electron beam , and thus meet the spatial constraints given by the hera electron ring .",
    "a schematic overview of the longitudinal polarimeter arrangement is shown in fig .  [",

    "a circularly polarized photon beam from a pulsed laser is focused on the hera electron beam .",
    "the laser - electron interaction point is located between the two bending magnets bh39 and bh90 at 39  m and 90  m from the hermes target , respectively .",
    "a calorimeter measures the energy of the back - scattered compton photons for each laser pulse . if the electron beam is longitudinally polarized , the energy distributions of the compton photons differ for left - handed and right - handed photon helicities .",
    "a frequency - doubled , pulsed nd : yag laser  @xcite operated at 532  nm , corresponding to a photon energy of @xmath19 ev , is used for the measurements .",
    "the laser produces @xmath20ns long pulses of linearly polarized light and can be operated with a continuously variable repetition rate from single shot up to 100  hz , and pulse energies from 1 to 250  mj .",
    "the laser is synchronized with the electron bunches in the hera ring , and triggered at close to 100  hz . the timing and the intensity of each laser pulse",
    "are measured by two photo diodes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : laser - layout.eps ] . to minimize pulse - to - pulse intensity fluctuations ,",
    "the laser is operated at a fixed energy of 100  mj per pulse .",
    "the intensity of the laser pulses can be controlled by passing the laser beam through a rotatable half wave plate and a fixed glan - thompson prism .",
    "the linearly polarized laser light is converted to a circularly polarized beam by passing it through an electrically reversible birefringent cell , known as a pockels cell .",
    "the voltage on the pockels cell  @xcite is adjusted to produce a quarter wave phase shift which is reversed each pulse .",
    "the degree of circular polarization @xmath21 of the laser beam is larger than 0.999 for each of the two helicity states @xmath22 , and is checked regularly with a polarization analyzer  @xcite consisting of a rotatable half wave plate , a glan - thompson prism , and a photo diode . before entering the laser transport system ,",
    "the beam diameter is expanded by a factor of four by a set of plano - concave and plano - convex lenses  @xcite .",
    "this beam expander reduces the divergence of the laser beam to allow it to traverse the @xmath23 m long light path to the laser - electron interaction region and also to reduce the resulting waist at the interaction point . in addition",
    ", it minimizes the sensitivity to variations in the laser beam divergence , and it reduces the energy density of the laser beam to prevent damage to the optical components in the light path .",
    "the laser beam is guided by six remotely controlled mirrors  @xcite through a total of @xmath24 m of stainless steel vacuum pipe , and focused with a lens doublet  @xcite on the hera electron beam , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lpol - layout.eps ] .",
    "the mirrors are arranged in three phase - compensated pairs to maintain the polarization of the photon beam close to 100% . behind each mirror ,",
    "a video camera is installed to monitor the laser beam position .",
    "the laser beam enters the storage ring vacuum through a @xmath25 cm thick fused silica window  @xcite and is brought into collision with the electron beam at a vertical angle of 8.7  mrad .",
    "the window was mounted with helicoflex gaskets  @xcite to minimize stress such that it has negligible optical retardation .    at the interaction point , the laser spot has a diameter of approximately 0.5  mm , and the transverse size of the electron beam is @xmath26 0.6  mm horizontally and @xmath27 0.2  mm vertically .",
    "each electron bunch is approximately @xmath28 mm long ( corresponding to 37@xmath29ps ) , i.e. about one hundred times shorter than the laser pulse . after passing through the interaction point , the laser beam exits the storage ring vacuum system through an identical vacuum window and enters a second polarization analyzer which also monitors the position and the intensity of the laser light .",
    "the location of the laser - electron interaction region was chosen to optimize the rate of the back - scattered compton photons versus the background rate , and to minimize changes to the electron ring vacuum system . maximizing",
    "the compton rate means that the crossing angle between the laser beam and the electron beam should be as small as possible , and the horizontal widths of the electron and laser beams should both be small .",
    "in addition , the transverse spatial distribution of the back - scattered compton photons due to the size and divergence of the electron beam had to be minimized , since the back - scattered photons have to travel about 54  m to the calorimeter .",
    "the laser - electron interaction point is located in the east right hera tunnel section , 13  m downstream of the first dipole magnet bh39 , which bends the beam by 0.54  mrad ( fig .",
    "[ fig : longpol_overview.eps ] ) .",
    "this is enough to prevent a large fraction of the bremsstrahlung generated by the residual gas in the long straight vacuum section upstream of bh39 , and by the hermes gas target in particular , from reaching the calorimeter . on the other hand ,",
    "it is little enough that it rotates the spin by only 1.9@xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding reduction of the measured longitudinal beam polarization is negligible ( 0.06% ) .",
    "the scattered electrons and photons travel with the unscattered electron beam until the electrons are deflected by the dipole magnet bh90 , which has a bending radius of 1262  m and deflects the beam by 2.7  mrad .",
    "a collimator is installed in the beam line 6  m downstream of bh90 to further reduce possible bremsstrahlung contributions from the hermes target . in order to minimize changes to the electron ring vacuum system ,",
    "the calorimeter position was chosen 16  m downstream of bh90 .",
    "this puts strict constraints on the transverse size of the calorimeter , since the electron beam and the center of the back - scattered compton photon distribution are separated by only 42  mm at the chosen position .",
    "the detector assembly is mounted on a remotely controlled table that can be moved vertically and horizontally .",
    "a light tight aluminum box contains the electromagnetic shower detector shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : crycalo - layout.eps ] .",
    "the detector is positioned very close to the electron beam pipe during normal operation .",
    "therefore , the lateral face of the box near the beam pipe is made of a @xmath20 mm thick tungsten plate to protect the detector against soft synchrotron radiation emerging from the beam pipe .",
    "the front of the detector is positioned 21 mm downstream of a copper vacuum window in the hera beam tube .",
    "this window is 2@xmath29 mm thick and 34@xmath29 mm in diameter .",
    "the compton photons enter the detector through a set of two @xmath32 mm ( @xmath33 radiation lengths ) thick lead plates , which serves as an effective shield against the intense synchrotron radiation generated by the dipole magnet bh90 .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter consists of four optically isolated nabi(wo@xmath34)@xmath35 crystals .",
    "each crystal is 20@xmath29 cm long ( 19 radiation lengths ) , 22@xmath29 mm wide and 22@xmath29 mm high , arranged in a @xmath36 array , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : crycalo - layout.eps ] .",
    "the crystal material has a high index of refraction ( @xmath37 ) , and is very radiation - hard ( @xmath38 rad )  @xcite and compact ( molire radius 2.38  cm ) .",
    "the compton photons generate an electromagnetic shower in the lead preshower and the crystals .",
    "the charged particles of the electromagnetic shower produce erenkov light , which is detected by one photomultiplier tube  @xcite for each crystal .",
    "the sharing of the shower between the four calorimeter blocks allows a sub - millimeter alignment of the nabi(wo@xmath34)@xmath35 array with respect to the compton photon beam .",
    "the event trigger is provided by a pulser at a rate of approximately 200  hz .",
    "the laser is fired by only every second pulse , allowing a background event to be recorded following each compton event .",
    "each laser pulse is synchronized with the hera bunch clock , which is provided by a bunch trigger module ( btm )  @xcite .",
    "the btm is also used to select a specific electron bunch in a sequence determined by a programmable digital signal processor ( dsp )  @xcite .",
    "four consecutive events are recorded for each selected bunch : for each of the two light helicity states , one background event and one event where the laser was fired .",
    "the program of the dsp further provides the option of scanning any subset of the beam bunches in any sequence . from the recorded single bunch data ,",
    "one can extract the polarization of a single bunch , the average beam polarization of all the bunches , or the polarization of any set of bunches , e.g. only colliding or non - colliding bunches .",
    "the trigger also allows for pedestal or gain monitoring events during empty hera beam bunches . the hermes gain monitoring system  @xcite monitors the response of the compton photon detector by sending laser light pulses through glass fibers that are coupled to the front faces of the nabi(wo@xmath34)@xmath35 crystals .",
    "the signals from the four photomultiplier tubes are digitized by a charge sensitive adc  @xcite , and transferred by the dsp to the hermes data acquisition system , which is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "also the signals from the various photodiodes are recorded .",
    "for each compton event , the timing of the laser pulse measured by the `` laser timing '' pin diode ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : laser - layout.eps ] ) is recorded relative to the bunch timing by a tdc  @xcite .",
    "normal operation of the longitudinal polarimeter requires an optimum overlap of the laser and electron beams in both space and time to maximize the back - scattered compton rate .",
    "the spatial overlap is achieved by steering the laser beam horizontally through the interaction point with mirror m4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lpol - layout.eps ] ) .",
    "the timing of the laser pulse is set with respect to the electron bunches by adjusting the laser trigger delay for maximum luminosity .",
    "the luminosity is monitored continuously by the polarimeter control system  @xcite .",
    "if the luminosity drops below a specified value , the procedures described above are executed automatically to re - optimize it .",
    "this online feedback system also ensures that the calorimeter remains centered on the back - scattered compton photon distribution , and that the startup and shutdown of the laser system are executed automatically .",
    "therefore , under normal conditions , polarization measurements are performed without intervention during hera operation .",
    "the detector can be operated in two different modes , the single - photon and the multi - photon mode .",
    "in contrast to the single - photon mode , in which the energy of each individual compton photon is analyzed , in the multi - photon mode one measures the total energy deposited in the detector by many compton photons per laser pulse interaction with an electron bunch .",
    "the multi - photon mode was chosen as the standard mode of operation to provide high statistics single bunch measurements in real time , and to overwhelm the bremsstrahlung backgrounds originating from the residual vacuum pressure in the straight section between the two dipole magnets bh39 and bh90 .",
    "the single - photon mode is used for test and diagnosis purposes only .",
    "the advantages of running in single - photon mode would be twofold .",
    "the asymmetries are large , up to 0.60 at the compton edge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : analyzing - power.eps ] ) , and the energy spectra can be compared to the compton cross sections .",
    "operation of the longitudinal polarimeter in this mode is possible if the laser pulse intensity is drastically reduced .",
    "however , the resolution for single - photon events is rather poor , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : single - photon.eps ] , because most of the generated erenkov light is trapped in the crystals and does not reach the photomultiplier tubes due to the high index of refraction of the crystals and the @xmath20 mm air gap between the crystals and the photomultiplier tubes .",
    "while compton spectra can be produced , and the beam polarization can be extracted , this is not a feasible mode of operation with the 100  hz laser , since a measurement of the beam polarization with an absolute statistical accuracy of 0.01 takes about 2.5 hours . in comparison ,",
    "such a measurement takes only one minute in the multi - photon mode .    in the single - photon mode",
    ", the asymmetry can be written as    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the cross sections for the electron - photon configurations where the incident spins are antiparallel and parallel , respectively , and @xmath42 is the average circular light polarization .",
    "the electron beam polarization is determined by fitting the energy spectra for the two spin configurations using a simulation ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : single - photon.eps ] ) that includes the response function and resolution of the detector , and realistic background conditions  @xcite above a compton photon energy of 4  gev .",
    "whereas the simulation represents the data well above 4  gev , it considerably underestimates the background at lower energies .",
    "the operation of the longitudinal polarimeter in multi - photon mode has the advantage of being effectively independent of bremsstrahlung background in the hera storage ring .",
    "a large number of compton photons is produced each time a laser pulse interacts with an electron bunch .",
    "these photons are detected together by the calorimeter , which measures their energy sums @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the and electron - photon configurations , respectively . in the multi - photon mode ,",
    "an energy asymmetry is formed as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the analyzing power of the process . under the assumption that the photomultiplier signals are linear over the full single - photon to multi - photon operating range , @xmath46",
    "is given by the integrals over the energy weighted cross sections for the and configurations and @xmath47 , multiplied by the single - photon relative response function @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the digitized adc signal ) of the detector .",

    "their asymmetry is largest for photon energies close to the compton edge ( @xmath53 ) . for small photon energies the two distributions are nearly identical",

    "the resulting analyzing power was found to be @xmath57 .",
    "note that only the precision of the measurement of the calorimeter response is important , and not its deviation from linearity .",
    "however , to apply the result for the relative response function obtained from the test beam measurements to eq .",
    "( 6 ) , it was necessary to show that the photomultiplier response is linear over the full single - photon to multi - photon operating range .",
    "this was verified using the gain monitoring system .",
    "the ultimate test was then to show that the measurement of the beam polarization was not affected by changing from single - photon to multi - photon mode .",
    "this was demonstrated by attenuating the laser beam intensity over three orders of magnitude using a rotatable half wave plate and a fixed glan - thompson prism while increasing the photomultiplier high - voltage such that the digitized signal of the photomultiplier remained constant .",
    "the test was performed during stable electron beam conditions while monitoring the beam polarization with the transverse polarimeter by observing the ratio of the polarization of the two polarimeters . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : single - to - multi - mode.eps ] , the ratio was constant over the entire range .    once the calorimeter response was understood in the single - photon and multi - photon modes , the longitudinal beam polarization was determined by evaluating the calorimeter signals for every bunch individually .",
    "although the laser is triggered by a precise electronic signal that is synchronized with the hera bunch timing , the time of the resulting light pulse fluctuates within @xmath58ns .",
    "because of this fluctuation and the finite crossing angle , the @xmath59ps long electron bunches interact with varying parts of the @xmath20ns long laser pulses .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the timing of each laser pulse is recorded relative to the trigger signal .",
    "the calorimeter signal reflects the temporal profile of the laser pulses if it is plotted versus the relative trigger time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumi - corr.eps ] . with a fit to this distribution",
    ", the calorimeter response is corrected for this variation .",
    "switching between the two light helicity states results in the two energy distributions for the corrected calorimeter signals @xmath43 and @xmath44 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi - photon.eps ] for an individual bunch .",

    "this calculation is provided every minute .",
    "the longitudinal beam polarization is finally computed as the mean of the individual bunch polarizations weighted by the corresponding time - averaged bunch currents .",
    "a large number of compton photons can be produced per laser pulse when the polarimeter is operated in the multi - photon mode , ranging from a few photons to many thousand . during normal operating mode in which about 1000 back - scattered compton photons are produced at the beginning of a fill , approximately 250 times more",
    "energy is deposited in the calorimeter than the highest energies ( bremsstrahlung ) deposited in the single - photon mode , since the average energy deposited per compton photon is 6.8 gev . in order to attenuate the erenkov light to protect the photomultiplier tubes from saturation , a remotely controlled movable , perforated nickel foil",
    "could be inserted into the 3  mm air gap between the nabi(wo@xmath34)@xmath35 crystals and the photomultiplier tubes .",
    "this was initially the standard mode of operation .    even though the nabi(wo@xmath34)@xmath35 crystals are 19  radiation lengths long , there is a small amount of longitudinal shower leakage into the photomultiplier tubes .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding shower particles generate a large signal in the photomultiplier tubes , which introduces a substantial non - linearity in the energy response .",
    "the longitudinal shower leakage signal derives mostly from the highest energy compton photons and hence has a large analyzing power .",
    "when the erenkov light produced in the nabi(wo@xmath34)@xmath35 crystals was attenuated by the nickel foil , the shower leakage signal dominated the signal in the photomultiplier tubes .",
    "this altered the response function and increased the analyzing power of the detector by about 25% .",
    "the polarimeter has been operated without any light attenuators since early 1999 .",

    "this detailed polarization information about the electron beam will be crucial for the collider experiments h1 and zeus since they are preparing to measure spin observables after the luminosity upgrade in 2001 . whereas the hermes experiment is sensitive to the average beam polarization of all the bunches , the collider experiments are sensitive to the colliding bunches only .",
    "various studies have been performed to investigate the systematic uncertainty associated with the polarization measurements by the longitudinal polarimeter operated in the multi - photon mode . since the polarization of the electron beam is obtained from a measurement of an asymmetry @xmath60 ( see eq .",

    "the circular polarization of the laser light can be determined very precisely  @xcite immediately following the pockels cell in the laser room .",
    "however , it can in principle be different at the interaction point , given the fact that the laser beam has to be passed through windows and lenses and be reflected from mirrors before it interacts with the electron beam . to estimate this uncertainty ,",
    "the laser beam polarization was measured after the storage ring vacuum window with the identical analyzer that is normally mounted in the laser room .",
    "the two vacuum windows were removed , then each window was mounted separately , and finally the ring vacuum was re - established , while measuring the laser beam polarization after each step .",

    "the measurement may also be affected by changes in the phase space of the laser beam at the interaction point due to an imperfectly aligned pockels cell .",
    "horizontal or vertical shifts of the laser beam can occur when the voltage across the cell is changed , resulting in a helicity - dependent luminosity and hence a false energy asymmetry . to quantify extraneous helicity - dependent beam shift effects in the system , we performed two tests .",
    "first , a half wave plate was temporarily mounted immediately following the pockels cell . except for the expected change of sign in the measurement of the electron beam polarization ,",
    "no change in the magnitude was observed within the @xmath69 precision of the test .",
    "however , this test does not account for non - optimal laser and electron beam overlap .",
    "this is important since the sensitivity to a helicity - dependent laser beam shift increases with decreasing overlap .",
    "therefore a second test was performed by changing the overlap of the two beams within the limits of the normal operating conditions .",
    "this showed that the impact on the energy asymmetry is at most @xmath69 .",
    "combining the two values leads to a total contribution of @xmath66 .",
    "the position and size of the compton photon beam incident on the calorimeter is determined by the electron beam orbit conditions at the interaction point . during normal hera luminosity operation , variations of the size and divergence of the electron beam are so small that the impact on the calorimeter response is negligible . however , a change of the position or slope of the electron beam at the interaction point can result in a shift of the compton photon distribution away from the center of the calorimeter . in these cases ,",
    "the online feedback system of the polarimeter automatically repositions the calorimeter center on the compton photon beam to better than 1  mm precision . by scanning the compton photon beam across the calorimeter front face",
    ", it has been determined that within the relevant operating range , the effect on the measurement of the beam polarization is less than @xmath71 . to estimate the effect of slow beam drifts during a fill ,",
    "the slope of the electron beam was moved over the maximal observed range while keeping the compton photon distribution centered on the calorimeter .",
    "no influence on the polarization measurement was observed within the @xmath67 accuracy of the study .",
    "combining the uncertainties of the two tests leads to a total contribution of at most @xmath65 .",
    ".the various contributions to the fractional systematic uncertainty of the longitudinal electron beam polarization @xmath12 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ta : syst - errors ]    the various contributions to the systematic uncertainties of the longitudinal polarimeter have been considered separately and added in quadrature to a total uncertainty of @xmath72 ( see table  [ ta : syst - errors ] ) .",
    "those systematic uncertainties of the two hera electron beam polarimeters that relate to stability and reproducibility ( not absolute scale ) can be further studied by comparing their performances over an extended period of time .",
    "non - statistical fluctuations in the ratio of their results over the 1999 - 2000 running periods correspond to a relative systematic stability of @xmath73 , which is compatible with the quadratic sum of contributions estimated from the two instruments .",
    "we have designed and constructed a compton back - scattering laser polarimeter which routinely measures the longitudinal polarization of the hera electron beam for the hermes experiment .",
    "the longitudinal polarimeter determines the beam polarization with an absolute statistical precision of 0.01 per minute and a fractional systematic uncertainty of @xmath72 .",
    "the polarimeter also measures the polarization of individual electron bunches , a feature that is currently not available to the transverse polarimeter .",
    "it was found that the individual bunches can each have a significantly different polarization .",
    "this observation can be further analyzed if one groups the bunches into colliding and non - colliding bunches .",
    "the variation and the time evolution of the polarization of the individual bunches and of classes of bunches provide important additional information for achieving high beam polarization at hera .",
