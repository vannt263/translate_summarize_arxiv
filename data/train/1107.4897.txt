    "avoiding the big bang singularity in cosmological models had been a recurring idea in the literature .",
    "the hopes for constructing a model without singularity were largely dashed by the singularity theorems of hawking and penrose ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "they were temporarily revived by the finding of vickers @xcite that in a charged dust model generalising that of lematre @xcite and tolman @xcite ( lt ) the big bang can be prevented by the charge distribution , provided that the absolute value of the charge density is , in geometrical units , _ smaller _ than the mass density .",
    "this finding created another expectation , that a finite ball of charged dust matched to the reissner @xcite  nordstrm @xcite ( rn ) solution would be able to collapse and bounce through the wormhole of the maximally extended rn manifold , thereby giving physical meaning to the infinite chain of black holes and asymptotically flat regions .",
    "first appeared in the paper by carter @xcite in 1966 , and was described in detail in a review article by carter @xcite .",
    "@xcite for another pedagogical introduction .",
    "] however , this renewed hope was dashed again in 1991 by ori @xcite who proved that , under exactly the same conditions that prevent the big bang , shell crossings will inevitably appear and destroy the dust ball before it enters the wormhole .",
    "then , krasiski and bolejko @xcite found a gap in ori s assumptions and tried to improve upon his result .",
    "namely , ori assumed that the ratio of the absolute value of the charge density to the mass density ( call this ratio @xmath1 ) is smaller than 1 everywhere , including the centre of symmetry .",
    "krasiski and bolejko considered the case when @xmath2 at the centre , while being @xmath3 everywhere else .",
    "the situation turned out to be better , but not definitively . with initial conditions carefully tuned",
    ", the charged dust ball could go through the wormhole just once , being destroyed by shell crossings soon after reaching the maximal size in the next asymptotically flat region .",
    "moreover , a direction - dependent singularity necessarily appeared at the centre of the ball at the instant of minimal size .",
    "this is not a satisfactory situation , but the best result achieved so far .    in an attempt to find a better model",
    ", we now tried to match the ruban @xcite charged dust solution to the rn metric and see what results .",
    "the charged ruban solution is a generalisation to nonzero charge of the nonstatic dust solution investigated earlier by ruban @xcite , which in turn is an inhomogeneous generalisation of the kantowski ",
    "sachs model @xcite .",
    "the matching of these two solutions is very easily achieved , with an interesting result .",
    "the ruban solution represents a pulsating charged dust ball whose outer surface must remain forever between the two event horizons of the rn solution .",
    "it touches the inner event horizon at its minimal size and the outer horizon at its maximal size .",
    "however , a simple investigation shows that shell crossings are inevitable inside the ball and do not allow even a half cycle of an oscillation , appearing between the maximum and minimum size both in the expansion phase and in the collapse phase .",
    "thus , the field is still open for finding a physical nonstatic source for the rn solution that would proceed through the wormhole . the next thing to do",
    "is to find a charged perfect fluid solution of the einstein ",
    "maxwell equations in which pressure gradients would prevent the formation of shell crossings .",
    "this , however , promises to be an extremely difficult task .    in this paper , we first present the rn solution in coordinates adapted to the matching , then the charged ruban solution as found by the author , then we prove that the matching can be done , and finally we prove that shell crossings in the ruban solution are inevitable .",
    "we also investigate the limit of zero charge of the ruban  rn configuration .",
    "then the dust source is matched to the schwarzschild solution across a hypersurface that remains inside the schwarzschild horizon , only touching it from inside at the moment of maximal expansion .",
    "shell crossings can then be avoided by an appropriate choice of the arbitrary functions in the ruban model . however ,",
    "this model has a finite time of existence , being born in a big bang that matches to the past kruskal @xcite ",
    "szekeres @xcite singularity and crushing into a big crunch that matches to the future ks singularity .",
    "we use the signature @xmath4 .",

    "this shows that as @xmath40 increases , @xmath28 is oscillating between the @xmath17 and @xmath15 given by ( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.4 ] ) .",

    "the other equations imply @xmath49 where @xmath7 is a constant of integration , and @xmath50 is the electric charge within the sphere of coordinate radius @xmath19 . since all other quantities in this equation are independent of @xmath19 , it follows that @xmath50 must be constant .",
    "this implies that the charge density is zero everywhere .",

    "it turns out they will collide before the cylinder manages to proceed all the way from the minimal radius to maximal , or from maximal to minimal . one more property of such a shell crossing is noteworthy : its locus does not depend on @xmath19 , which means that all the spheres with different values of @xmath19 collide at the same moment .",
