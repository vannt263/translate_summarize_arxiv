    "the lagoon nebula ( m8 , ngc 6523 ) is one of the most prominent bright nebulae in the sky , and contains regions of recent star formation and many early - type stars .",
    "the optically brightest portion of the nebula lies near the object herschel 36 .",
    "previously considered a single o - type star , herschel 36 has recently been spectroscopically resolved into a o7.5 v star in a @xmath1500-day , @xmath13 au mutual orbit with a close late - o / early - b binary ( arias et al .",
    "the presence of an additional heavily embedded star of early b - type has been inferred 0.25 arcsec ( 375 au at 1500 pc ) southeast of the triplet ( goto et al.2006 ) .",
    "the herschel 36 system thus has much in common with the trapezium system in the orion nebula .",
    "the hot stars , presumably dominated by the o7.5 v component , are the primary illuminating source for the bright region 15@xmath4 east of herschel 36 , known as the hourglass for its distinctive shape in optical images ( thackeray 1950 , wolff 1961 ) .",
    "additional hot stars ionize the extended region surrounding the hourglass",
    ". infrared radiation from the embedded early b - type star may be responsible for the unusually high excitation of ch and ch@xmath3 seen in optical spectra towards herschel 36 ( oka et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the herschel 36 system is highly obscured by dust ( e(b - v ) = 0.87 ) , and the line of sight shows exceptional extinction characteristics . the total - to - selective extinction ratio , @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7/@xmath8 = 5.21 @xmath9 0.10 ( fitzpatrick & massa 2007 ) , is one of the largest known and a correction for foreground material suggests an even larger @xmath5 for material local to herschel 36 ( hecht et al .  1982 ) . this value is consistent with a population of larger than normal dust grains .",
    "the far - uv extinction curve is correspondingly shallow ( fitzpatrick & massa 2007 ) , and it is the very weak uv extinction that allows sufficient transmission of light for far - uv observations .    while the hourglass and the general region around herschel 36 have been studied extensively at various wavelengths ( see dahlstrom et al .",
    "2013 for a review ) there has been no previous uv spectroscopy toward herschel 36 with sufficient resolution and s / n for interstellar absorption line studies . in this paper , we give the results of such an investigation , focusing on the highly unusual molecular hydrogen absorption seen along the line of sight .",
    "herschel 36 was observed twice by the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) as part of the pi team `` translucent '' cloud program ( rachford et al .",
    "2002 ) ; see table 1 for observation details . although our initial analysis involved earlier data products , for our final results we used data downloaded from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) in late 2011 , which was processed with version 3.2.1 of the calfuse pipeline . while data are present shortward of 1000   down to near the lyman limit , the s / n is quite poor at these wavelengths .",
    "thus , we have focused on data longward of 1000   in the lif 1a channel ( 987.41082.7  ) and the lif 2a channel ( 1086.91181.5  ) ( see moos et al .",
    "2000 for more information on the configuration of the _ fuse _ spectrograph ) .",
    "the velocity resolution is @xmath10@xmath11 @xmath12 1520 km / s , depending on wavelength and instrument channel . outside of the deep absorption bands of h@xmath0 and other strong absorption features , the s / n per resolution element is typically 1530 with the best s / n occurring at wavelengths longer than 1100  .",
    "cccc p1162001 & 2000 aug 30 & 10.6 & lwrs + p1162002 & 2004 apr 8 & 5.9 & lwrs      the overall far - uv spectrum is typical of significantly reddened stars , as it is dominated by absorption from and h@xmath0 , the latter in the form of damped ro - vibrational bandheads due to absorption from the @xmath13 = 0 and @xmath13 = 1 levels .",
    ", as simply @xmath13 , and similarly writing the lower vibrational level as @xmath11 .",
    "] however , a closer look at the spectra reveals three unusual features .",
    "first , we see a large number of weak lines corresponding to absorption from excited vibrational states .",
    "a sample of these lines is given in figure 1 .",
    "vibrational excitation of h@xmath0 in diffuse and translucent lines of sight of sufficient magnitude to be detected with _",
    "fuse _ is quite rare .",
    "prominent examples include the lines of sight toward hd 34078 ( boiss et al .",
    "2005 ) , and hd 37903 ( gnaciski 2011 ) . only the latter is comparable with the herschel 36 spectrum in terms of the quantity and strength of vibrationally excited lines .",
    "second , when looking at lines from the @xmath13 = 24 levels of the ground vibrational state , we see a broad velocity structure spread across tens of km s@xmath2 .",
    "finally , we see a significant velocity shift in a portion  but not all  of the material between the first observation and the second .",
    "the highly excited material is a compelling issue on its own ; in fact it appears to be the strongest such excitation seen to date in ultraviolet absorption spectra .",
    "recent work has also revealed unusually strong excitation of the ch and ch@xmath3 molecules along this line of sight , as well as extended redward wings in several diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) consistent with excitation of higher than normal rotational states in the molecules that presumably produce the dib absorption ( dahlstrom et al .",
    "2013 )    a full understanding of the velocity structure and changes in velocity structure seen in the _ fuse _ spectra will likely require additional data and analysis .",
    "however , considerable information on excited h@xmath0 is available from just the existing _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "thus , in this paper we will mainly focus on the excited h@xmath0 and explore the other two issues only as they directly relate to the highly excited material .",
    "the lines from @xmath13 @xmath14 5 of the ground vibrational state , and lines from the excited vibrational states are narrow enough to be consistent with the resolution of the spectrograph .",
    "thus , any velocity structure is buried within the resolution element , and we will treat those lines as representing a single component that we call the `` highly excited '' component . it is probable that the strongest @xmath13 = 5 lines show a weak wing that represents a small fraction of the absorption",
    ". however , our analysis primarily relies upon the weakest @xmath13 = 5 lines . as a predictive guide to the vibrationally excited lines",
    ", we estimated the strength of each putative line based on column densities toward hd 37903 derived from a high resolution _ hst stis _ spectrum ( meyer et al .  2002 ) which shows similar h@xmath0 excitation to our spectrum of herschel 36 .",
    "we then selected lines from the abgrall et al.(1993a , b ) lists that were most likely to be unblended and visible at the lower resolution and sensitivity of the _ fuse _ spectra .    given that the observed excited h@xmath0 line profiles are dominated by the _ fuse _ instrumental profile , which is reasonably modeled by a gaussian especially at low to moderate s / n ( e.g. , jensen et al .  2010 ) , we measured lines by fitting gaussian profiles .",
    "thus , we obtained central wavelength , line depth , and line width , the latter two quantities directly give the equivalent width of the line and a formal uncertainty .",
    "we combined this uncertainty in quadrature with a continuum uncertainty estimated from the line width and the noise in the continuum fit . in many cases ,",
    "this likely overestimates the true uncertainties .",
    "however , continuum placement is a particular challenge here given the likelihood of otherwise undetected vibrationally excited lines contaminating the continuum , analogous to the  line fog \" seen in optical spectra of late - type stars .",
    "when possible , adjacent h@xmath0 lines were deblended with multiple gaussians .",
    "although our technique was to measure lines and perform a curve - of - growth analysis , there is significant line confusion due to the wealth of detectable transitions , most of which have never been observed in _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "thus , we followed an iterative process whereby we generated a model spectrum from the curve - of - growth analysis , used that to check if the levels were reasonably modeled , and then explored individual lines again .",
    "many lines were eliminated based on the modeling suggesting that a stronger line may be contaminated by a weaker line .",
    "this procedure leverages the strength of the curve - of - growth method ( i.e. , deriving the @xmath15-value and column densities simultaneously with the cleanest lines ) while not having to fully model the continuum , stellar flux , and instrumental function across the entire spectrum .    despite the first observation having a longer exposure time , the second observation was of higher quality and we were able to measure more lines .",
    "thus we used the second observation as the primary source for the excited lines . unfortunately , even in the second observation most lines were detected below the 3-@xmath16 level relative to the combined measurement uncertainties and continuum uncertainties .",
    "our final list included 122 lines from 37 ro - vibrational levels in the second observation , and we successfully measured 72 of those lines in the first observation .",
    "figure 2 shows that there is reasonable agreement in the equivalent widths of these lines , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "this indicates that there was not a dramatic change in the strength of the excited component between the two observations , and allows us to treat the second observation as representative .",
    "we note that absorption from additional ro - vibrational levels is evident in the second spectrum , but we limited the analysis to levels where we were most confident that at least one uncontaminated line could be decisively measured .",
    "we performed least squares fits of the equivalent widths from the second observation to a grid of single - component curves of growth with 0.1 km s@xmath2 spacing in @xmath15 .",
    "we attempted fits for lines from various combinations of ro - vibrational states and consistently found small @xmath15-values less than 2 km s@xmath2 for most of these combinations .",
    "thus , we adopted the overall best - fit of @xmath15 = 1.2 km s@xmath2 .",
    "in figure 3 , we show the @xmath13 = 59 levels of the vibrational ground state , which carry most of the weight in the curve of growth fits .",
    "the resulting column densities for all measured levels are given in table 2 .",

    "thus , we are more confident in the derived @xmath15-value than would be warranted by purely the analysis of measured lines .",
    "the derived @xmath15-value for the highly excited h@xmath0 is quite small ; we are unaware of any smaller values ever found in absorption",
    ". other lines of sight with considerable vibrational excitation have also shown relatively small @xmath15-values with a single component even at a resolution of @xmath13 km s@xmath2 from _ hst _ data ( meyer at al .",
    "2001 and gnaciski 2011 for hd 37903 from _ fuse _ and _ hst _ ; boiss et al 2005 for hd 34078 from _ fuse _ ; gnaciski 2013 for hd 147888 _ fuse _ and _ hst _ ) .",
    "smaller @xmath15-values of less than 1 km s@xmath2 are seen for individual components of various atomic species in many lines of sight in spectra with @xmath11 km s@xmath2 resolution ( e.g. , welty & hobbs 2001 )",
    ". however , due to the lack of ultra high resolution uv observations , we do not know if this holds for h@xmath0 as well , and the low mass of the molecule also works against very small @xmath15-values . for purely thermal broadening , @xmath54 = 1.2 km s@xmath2 corresponds to a temperature of 174 k. this should be contrasted with the @xmath55 values for the @xmath11 = 1 rotational levels which are @xmath566000 k , rising to @xmath5622000 k for @xmath11 = 4 , indicating that the observed excitation is due to a non - thermal process .    to further assess the excitation , in figure 4 , we present an excitation diagram based on the column densities in table 2 .",
    "the large uncertainties are particularly apparent here , but the expected decreasing trend with increasing @xmath13 of the quantity column density divided by statistical weight is generally seen .",
    "the uncertainties make a more detailed quantitative modeling analysis difficult , as a broad range of cloud models could fit the column densities within the large uncertainties . however , a comparison with the apparently similar and better constrained situation with hd 37903 may be instructive .",
    "hd 37903 was analyzed by meyer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using only the high - quality _ stis _ data , and has been recently re - analyzed by also including _ fuse _ data which provided column densities for non - vibrationally excited levels ( gnaciski 2011 ) .",
    "in both analyses , interstellar cloud models favored an interpretation whereby the extreme h@xmath0 excitation was occurring in a relatively dense cloud of material @xmath10.5 pc away from hd 37903 .    in figure 5",
    ", we plot the excitation diagram for herschel 36 , along with those for hd 37903 ( gnaciski 2011 ) and hd 34078 ( boiss et al 2005 ) .",
    "these are the two lines of sight that show the strongest vibrationally excited lines , although hd 34078 only has column densities for relatively few highly excited levels .",
    "again , our values are highly uncertain , but the three lines of sight all show relatively large amounts of excited material , with evidence that the herschel 36 column densities are even larger than those towards the other two stars . these lines of sight should be contrasted with the finding of jensen et al .",

    "this means that vibrationally excited column densities for most lines of sight would be well below those seen in figure 5 .",
    "the few other lines of sight where vibrationally excited h@xmath0 has been detected in absorption also show smaller column densities those in figure 5 ; i.e. , federman et al .  (",

    ", we plot the column densities of the excited levels relative to the total line - of - sight h@xmath0 column densities . since the total h@xmath0 column density towards herschel 36 is smaller than for the other two lines of sight , the differences are exaggerated . however , in reality , the differences may be even greater . as we discuss in   3.3 , much of the line - of - sight material toward herschel 36",
    "may lie in the foreground of m8 and not be directly related to the highly excited material near the star itself .",
    "thus , the relative column densities of the highly excited levels may be even higher in the material that lies within m8 itself .",
    "figures 7 and 8 reveal the difficulty in interpreting low - excitation states in the highly excited component .",
    "broad structure appears for the @xmath13 = 24 lines ( we omit @xmath13 = 4 because with the weaker lines , the structure is not as obvious ) , and the highly excited component does not match either of the apparent peaks of the @xmath13 = 23 structure . nor does the highly excited component appear to represent more than a small fraction of the observed velocity range of @xmath13 = 23 . if the highly excited component were to actually represent either of the @xmath13 = 23 peaks or the bulk of the @xmath13 = 01 profiles , it would require an unrealistic velocity shift of more than 20 km s@xmath2 between @xmath13 = 5 and the lower levels .    in modeling the spectrum of the highly excited component for a variety of ro - vibrational bandheads and thus a range of oscillator strengths , we find that @xmath13 = 01 logarithmic column densities @xmath5618.5 clearly `` overshoot '' the observed profiles at those wavelengths .",
    "these values are much smaller than the total line of sight values reported by rachford ( 2009 ) ; 19.92 and 19.86 , respectively .",
    "we can set an uncertain _ lower _ limit on the low-@xmath13 column densities of the highly excited material by using the excitation diagram in figure 4 .",
    "if we fit a line to the @xmath13 = 510 levels of the ground vibrational state , we obtain a boltzmann excitation temperature of 2019@xmath61 k ( a fit of @xmath13 = 58 gives a similar result ) .",
    "if we extrapolate this line to lower levels , we obtain logarithmic column densities of 15.48 , 16.40 , 16.08 , 16.60 , 16.10 , for @xmath13 = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively . while the column densities for @xmath13 = 0 and @xmath13 = 1 may be significantly underestimated by this fit",
    ", it is common for @xmath13 = 2 or 3 to 6 and beyond to be reasonably fit by a single line ( see , e.g. , jensen et al .",
    "unless we dramatically increase the @xmath15-values , column densities much greater than these for @xmath13 = 24 will `` overshoot '' the observed profiles .",
    "the evidence for @xmath15-value changes as a function of @xmath13 ( e.g. jenkins & pembert 1997 ; lacour et al .",
    "2005 ) is that the more highly excited levels that may show larger @xmath15-values , a trend we do not see in our data . significantly smaller column densities are not physically compatible with the levels that we have been able to measure ; i.e. , they would not follow a boltzmann equilibrium trend .",
    "based on the arguments in the previous two paragraphs , our best estimates of the logarithmic column densities of the @xmath13 = 04 levels of the highly excited component are @xmath5718.0 , @xmath5718.0 , 16.1 , 16.6 , and 16.1 , respectively .",
    "while the material responsible for the extended velocity structure may lie within m8 , it does not produce measurable absorption in the more highly excited levels above @xmath13 = 5 , and thus must be much further from a strong uv source , and/or strongly shielded from uv radiation .",
    "the final difficulty in interpreting the highly excited component is a significant velocity shift during the 3.4 year gap between observations .",
    "figure 9 shows both observations with the wavelength solutions given by the calfuse 3.2.1 pipeline . for clarity ,",
    "only lines from the vibrational ground state have been labeled ; recall that levels @xmath13 @xmath14 5 are part of the highly excited material that shows no component structure .",
    "the line labels have not been shifted in this plot , and they line up to within several km s@xmath2 of the appropriate lines in the spectrum , as do the excited lines themselves .",
    "however , the @xmath13 = 01 bandhead is clearly offset between the two observations .",
    "in contrast , as shown in figure 10 , if we shift the second observation redward by 60 km s@xmath2 , the @xmath13 = 01 bandheads line up , while the excited material does not .",
    "we note that the difference in the total of the geocentric and heliocentric corrections for the two observations is 53 km s@xmath2 ; we first looked at this data before heliocentric corrections were implemented in calfuse , which resulted in a `` raw '' plot that looked like figure 10 rather than figure 9 .",
    "however , it seems highly unlikely that the bulk of the material  which appears to be in the foreground of m8  has undergone such a large velocity shift .",
    "thus , a @xmath160 km s@xmath2 redshift must have occurred in the highly excited material relative to the bulk of the material .",
    "this also indicates a @xmath160 km s@xmath2 deviation in the wavelength scale that was applied to the two observations , even though it appears that the correct geocentric and heliocentric corrections were applied .",
    "systematic velocity errors in version 3 of calfuse can be 10 km s@xmath2 or more ( dixon et al 2007 ) in certain circumstances .",
    "both _ fuse _ observations of herschel 36 were made through the 30@xmath4 square lwrs aperture . as noted by boiss et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , in comparing _",
    "fuse _ observations of hd 34078 taken through the lwrs aperture with an observation taken with the 4@xmath4 @xmath62 20@xmath4 mdrs aperture , there were subtle h@xmath0 line profile / strength differences .",
    "they attributed these differences to the extra diffuse nebular emission passing through the factor of 900/80 larger aperture .",
    "based on extinction curves from fitzpatrick & massa ( 2007 ) , the total extinction at 1100   toward herschel 36 is 8.5 mag as compared to 6.4 mag for hd 34078 , so we might expect scattered light to be a bigger issue for herschel 36 .",
    "some combination of excess diffuse emission , variations in the position of the lwrs on the sky , and variations in the path of light through the cloud from the 3 au orbit in the triple system may conspire to produce changes in the appearance of the two spectra of herschel 36 .",
    "however , such an effect would have to produce the very specific large velocity shift of the highly excited lines without large variations in the strength or width of the lines , and simultaneously the large profile variation specifically seen in the @xmath13 = 24 lines .",
    "nothing like this is seen toward hd 34078 , or any other _ fuse _ observations of which we are aware .",
    "we are unaware of any additional strong point - like uv sources within 30@xmath4 of the herschel 36 system that are visible from earth and thus might produce a composite spectrum .",
    "we also note that in modeling the @xmath13 = 01 lines , adding a shifted component even with @xmath11% of the total material caused the modeled profile to deviate strongly from the observed absorption .",

    "this is still much greater than our derived column density for this level of 1.8 @xmath62 10@xmath68 @xmath59 .",
    "burton ( 2002 ) observed that this peak emission occurs nearly 2 arcsec from herschel 36 .",
    "given the projection of the bipolar structure on either side of herschel 36 in the plane of the sky , little of this material may be directly in front of the star system .",
    "thus , the conclusion by burton ( 2002 ) that the h@xmath0 emission was tracing shock - heated gas does not mean that the highly excited h@xmath0 we see along the narrow beam to the stars in the herschel 36 system is the same material .",
    "similarly , the region around herschel 36 contains one of the strongest known co emission sites ( white et al .",
    "they estimated a peak column density of 2.1 @xmath62 10@xmath67 @xmath59 for n(c@xmath69o ) alone .",
    "the co peak was located very near the star , but the beamwidths were 1122 arcsec , depending on the observed transition . since our observed n(h@xmath0 ) appears to be much smaller than that implied by the peak co emission , it is not surprising that the co abundance observed in absorption toward herschel 36 is quite small .",
    "although it is hard to precisely measure the extent of the weak rotationally excited lines on either side of the @xmath13 = 0 line due to s / n issues , the e  x 00 band at 1076   implies @xmath63(co ) @xmath57 10@xmath70 @xmath59 , or a co / h@xmath0 ratio of @xmath57 6 @xmath62 10@xmath71 , consistent with direct uv pencil - beam derived ratios along lines of sight with similar abundances ( burgh , et al .",
    "2007 , sonnentrucker et al .",
    "2007 , sheffer et al . 2008 ) .",
    "clearly , both h@xmath0 and co show considerable spatial variability in the plane of the sky , and/or there is considerable material behind herschel 36 .",
    "this is consistent with the complex environment of herschel 36 summarized by dahlstrom et al.(2013 ) .",
    "the region near herschel 36 is very complex and has been studied at a variety of wavelengths .",
    "our far - uv observations provide the first look at h@xmath0 along the line of sight towards the uv - bright herschel 36 star system .",
    "we have found an absorption component displaying highly excited h@xmath0 apparently lying near the herschel 36 system which is subjected to an intense radiation field and experienced a @xmath160 km s@xmath2 redshift during a 3.6-year period .",
    "this component does not appear to be at the same velocity as the material which dominates the lower excitation , and this latter material does not appear to produce visible absorption beyond @xmath13 = 5 . given the width of the @xmath13 = 23 lines in the spectrum , multiple additional components may exist and/or there may be material in a relative narrow physical distance range but spread across a large velocity range .",
    "the highly excited component  the primary focus of this paper  appears to only contain a small fraction of the total h@xmath0 along the line of sight on the order of 1% .",
    "while certain portions of the material surrounding the herschel 36 system may be associated with outflows or jets and thus be shock heated ( burton 2002 ) , the material in the immediate foreground seen in our observations appears similar to that seen in front of hd 37903 which has been interpreted as the result of fluorescent excitation due to the strong uv field near the stars ( meyer et al.2001 ; gnaciski 2011 ) .",
    "other unusual excitation has been seen toward the herschel 36 system .",
    "dahlstrom et al .",
    "( 2013 ) reported the first known detection of rotationally excited ch and ch@xmath3 in absorption .",
    "this excitation is attributed by oka et al .",
    "( 2013 ) to far - ir radiation from a source @xmath1375 au from the main stellar triplet , believed to be a heavily embedded b - type star ( goto et al .",
    "unusual redward wings have been seen in some diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) toward herschel 36 , again thought to trace high levels of rotational excitation of the molecule(s ) responsible for the dibs ( dahlstrom et al .",
    "the environment near the herschel 36 system is thus an important laboratory for studying the effects of the intense radiation fields in young star clusters on gas and dust .",
    "_ hst _ observations with _ stis _ would provide a wealth of additional information on herschel 36 .",
    "first , we could much more precisely study the highly excited h@xmath0 via the hundreds of ro - vibrational transitions available longward of 1150   .",
    "this would permit precise enough column densities for a detailed modeling analysis of the excitation .",
    "second , the same observations will provide high resolution observations of numerous atomic and molecular species .",
    "this will allow us to assess the true velocity structure down to 3 km s@xmath2 resolution , and potential information on the physical conditions in the various components .",
    "this work is based on data obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa _ fuse _ mission operated by the johns hopkins university .",
