    "when making predictions in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , one encounters parameter freedom which is mainly due to the so - called soft susy breaking terms . to restrict this freedom and get more predictive power , one usually follows the universality hypothesis that assumes universality ( i.e. equality ) of soft terms at some high energy scale ( most common is the gut scale at which the gauge couplings are unified ) . under this assumption one",
    "is left with 5 free parameters , and a thorough analysis of the mssm mass spectrum in universal case has been done @xcite .",
    "however , the newest experiments , and first of all recent lep ii limits on the lightest higgs boson mass @xcite , suggest that this minimal scenario might not work in practice . in the present paper",
    "we try to clarify what one expects to get by releasing the universality conditions in the mssm , allowing more freedom for the soft terms , with the emphasis on the higgs boson mass predictions .    in order to see how the non - universality at the gut scale can change the predictions at the low energy scale , we use recently obtained analytical solutions to the renormalization group ( rg ) equations for the yukawa couplings @xcite . by means of grassmannian expansion",
    "they allow one to derive analytical expressions for soft term evolution @xcite and trace analytically the dependence of the soft terms at the @xmath6 scale on their boundary values . in this way",
    ", both the expediency of one or another simplifying hypotheses concerning gut scale values of the soft parameters and the role of non - universality in the context of the mssm can be estimated .",
    "the parameter space of the mssm can further be narrowed using the so - called infrared quasi - fixed point ( irqfp ) behaviour of some parameters @xcite , i.e. independence of low energy values on initial conditions at the gut scale . using the analytical results along with the numerical ones",
    ", one can keep over control the way how the irqfp strategy works . in what follows",
    "we adopt the method advocated in refs . @xcite and apply the above - mentioned tips in making prediction for the lightest higgs boson mass in the mssm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ir_analytic ] , we analyze the irqfp behaviour of soft parameters with the help of analytical solutions . in sec .",
    "[ lowtan ] , the low @xmath1 scenario with non - universality is investigated , and prediction for higgs boson mass is given . the same analysis is conducted in sec .",
    "[ bigtan ] for the case of large @xmath1 .",
    "our concluding remarks are presented in sec .",

    "as has been recently shown @xcite , the rges for yukawa couplings can be solved analytically by means of an iteration procedure . following the recipe advocated in @xcite ,",
    "the expressions for soft parameters can be derived from analytical solutions of yukawa coupling rges .",
    "below we provide a brief analysis of analytical solutions for the soft parameters , emphasizing the difference between universal and non - universal cases . for low @xmath1",
    "an exact analytical solution is known @xcite ; so we discuss just the case of large @xmath1 when all the yukawa couplings are essential .",
    "consider solutions to the rg equations for the soft terms .",
    "since the triple scalar couplings @xmath7 and gaugino masses @xmath8 have a dimension of a mass and the squark , slepton and higgs mass terms have a dimension of a mass squared , the corresponding rg equations are linear with respect to these parameters , and their solutions can be represented in the form @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 represent the squark , slepton and higgs mass terms , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , ( @xmath15 ) are the initial values of the parameters . in one loop order the coefficients of eq.([as ] ) can be calculated within the iteration procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we have calculated them up to the 6-th iteration , that allows one to get accuracy of 1% .",
    "evaluated at the @xmath6 scale , which corresponds to @xmath16 , they depend on the initial values of yukawa couplings . in what follows we use the notation @xmath17 and @xmath18 . to test the behaviour of the coefficients",
    ", we take several sets of yukawa couplings @xmath19 at the gut scale in the range @xmath20 with some arbitrary ratios of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the common value of the gauge couplings at the gut scale ) .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath24 is taken to preserve the perturbativity up to gut scale , the lower one keeps us in the large @xmath1 regime .    in fig.[a_mssmbig ]",
    "we plot the coefficients of eq.([as ] ) as functions of @xmath25 . for fixed @xmath26 different points for a given coefficient correspond to different relative ratios @xmath27 . in this section for illustration",
    "we consider three extreme cases : @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , to demonstrate relative insignificance of the non - universality of the yukawa couplings .",
    "+    +      indeed , one can see that for @xmath31 and regardless of the ratios @xmath27 ( but still remaining in the range corresponding to large @xmath1 ) the coefficients of soft breaking parameters in @xmath7 approach the asymptotic values equal to their irqfps . since at the same scale one has @xmath32",
    ", we conclude that the ratios @xmath33 exhibit the proper irqfp behaviour as used in ref.@xcite .",
    "hence , non - universality of the soft terms changes almost nothing in the irqfp behaviour for @xmath34 and @xmath35 because the coefficient of @xmath36 is bigger than the others by a factor of 5 or more .",
    "one should also note that non - universality of the yukawa couplings has a weak effect on the values of the soft terms coefficients . on the plot for @xmath34 (",
    "the same is true for @xmath35 ) for a given coefficient the three points corresponding to various ratios of yukawa couplings almost overlap . for @xmath37",
    "all the coefficients but @xmath38 and @xmath39 have comparable non - vanishing values and the irqfp is less stringent . there is also stronger dependence on the relative ratios of yukawa couplings .",
    "fortunately , @xmath37 does not play any significant role in the higgs mass prediction .",
    "the same observations holds true for the soft masses . taking the values of the yukawa couplings at the gut scale as above",
    ", we have found that for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 the prevalence of the gluino mass @xmath43 is obvious and non - universality does not change anything ( see on fig.[a_mssmbig ] the @xmath40 and @xmath42 plots ) when comparing with the universality case .    in the expression of @xmath44 the coefficients for some scalar masses are opposite in sign and of the same magnitude ( @xmath45 comes with + sign and @xmath46 , @xmath47 come with -",
    "sign ) , and the same is true for @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ) . in the case of universal boundary conditions , for the scalar masses @xmath44 and @xmath48 the only dependence on the initial conditions left is that on the gluino mass @xmath43 since the scalar mass @xmath12 contributions cancel each other . in the case of non - universality with some peculiar choice of initial conditions some residual dependence on the scalar masses",
    "may appear .",
    "nevertheless , one can still rely on asymptotic plateau for the coefficients at large yukawa couplings .    again",
    ", one observes that for @xmath50 the coefficients approach some asymptotic values and the dependence on non - universality of yukawa couplings is rather feeble for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and small enough for @xmath44 and @xmath48 .",
    "the residual dependence for the coefficients of @xmath43 in the latter case is because we get out of the large yukawa region : for @xmath51 we have @xmath52 which does nt ensure the irqfp regime .",
    "the masses of sleptons @xmath53 and @xmath54 exhibit rather a fuzzy picture ( see the last plot in fig.[a_mssmbig ] ) .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath43 is no longer the leading one , instead we have large contributions from @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "here some coefficients are negative , thus leading to negative values of e.g. @xmath53 if @xmath56 and @xmath45 are big enough .",
    "the requirement of positiveness of slepton masses imposes some bounds on non - universality choice . in our analysis below we take the relative ratios of the soft masses at the gut scale in the range @xmath57 which ensures @xmath58 for the most regions of the parameter space .",
    "these bounds are in agreement with those obtained in @xcite in the bottom - up approach . in the universal case",
    "both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are positive due to the cancellations between different soft terms .    on the plots in fig.[a_mssmbig ] , only those parameters which have non -",
    "negligible coefficients are shown .",
    "thus , we come to the following conclusions :    \\i ) if the yukawa couplings at the gut scale are large enough ( @xmath59 ) the coefficients of eqs.([as ] ) for the soft terms at low energy scale approach the asymptotic values for both the universal and non - universal boundary conditions , independently of the relative ratios of the yukawa couplings ; + ii ) for @xmath60 and @xmath61 at the @xmath6 scale the coefficient of @xmath62 dominates , the irqfp behaviour is substantiated and can be used for both the universal and non - universal boundary conditions .",
    "we begin our analysis of the influence of non - universality on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the low @xmath1 case . the present approach is based on our previous papers @xcite where we investigated the mass spectrum of sparticles and the higgs bosons using the conception of infrared quasi - fixed points ( irqfps ) with the assumption of universality of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "the concept of irqfps , which has been introduced in @xcite , was widely employed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it allows one to find the values of the relevant parameters at the @xmath6 scale without exact knowledge of their initial values . the validity of the fixed points is clearly demonstrated in the previous section .",
    "this analysis gives us an important information about the weight of various initial parameters in the calculations at low energy values and , finally , in the calculation of the mass spectrum .    in our previous papers @xcite ,",
    "we have concluded that all higgs bosons in the mssm except the lightest cp - even one , are too heavy to play an important role in the near future experiments ; therefore , in the present paper we concentrate on the lightest higgs boson only .    as input parameters we take the known value of the top - quark pole mass , @xmath63 gev @xcite , the experimental values of the gauge couplings @xcite @xmath64 and the sum of the higgs vev s squared @xmath65174.1 gev@xmath66 .",
    "we use the approximate and/or numerical solutions of the relevant rg equations to evaluate the fixed point values of the mass parameters . to calculate the mass of the lightest higgs boson",

    "we take @xmath77 which corresponds to @xmath78 .",
    "this gives the following value of @xmath1 : @xmath79 the deviations from the central value are connected with the deviation from the fixed point value of the yukawa coupling and the experimental uncertainties in the top - quark mass and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the higgs mixing parameter @xmath68 can be determined from the requirement of radiative ewsb and can be found from the higgs potential minimization condition .",
    "in contrast with our previous paper @xcite ( where we have taken into account only tree level minimization condition ) , we include here the one - loop corrections .",
    "it gives the difference of about 2 gev for the lightest higgs boson mass .",

    "the latter possess the irqfp s which we use in our analysis .",
    "the above equation allows one to obtain an absolute value of @xmath68 .",
    "the sign of @xmath68 remains a free parameter , however , as it has already been mentioned , negative values of @xmath68 give too small values of the lightest higgs boson mass and are excluded experimentally @xcite .    in the mssm ,",
