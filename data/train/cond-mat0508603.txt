    "most workers in the field of high @xmath1 superconductivity would agree that we have made enormous progress in the last 20 years in characterizing these materials and in identifying key theoretical questions and constructs .",
    "experimental progress , in large part , comes from transport studies @xcite in addition to three powerful spectroscopies : photoemission @xcite , neutron @xcite and josephson interferometry @xcite . over the last two decades",
    ", theorists have emphasized different aspects of the data , beginning with the anomalous normal state associated with the highest @xmath1 systems (  optimal doping \" ) and next , establishing the nature and implications of the superconducting phase , which was ultimately revealed to have a @xmath2-wave symmetry .",
    "now at the time of this twenty year anniversary , one of the most exciting areas of research involves the normal state again , but in the low @xmath1 regime , where the system is  underdoped \" and in proximity to the mott insulating phase .",
    "we refer to this unusual phase as the  pseudogap state \" .",
    "this pseudogap phase represents a highly anomalous form of superconductivity in the sense that there is an excitation gap present at the superfluid transition temperature @xmath1 where long range order sets in .",
    "the community has struggled with two generic classes of scenarios for explaining the pseudogap and its implications below @xmath1 .",
    "either the excitation gap is intimately connected to the superconducting order reflecting , for example , the existence of  pre - formed pairs \" , or it is extrinsic and associated with a competing ordered state unrelated to superconductivity .",
    "the emphasis of this review is on the pseudogap state as addressed by a particular preformed pair scenario which has its genesis in what is now referred to as  bec - bose einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover theory \" .",
    "here one contemplates that the attraction ( of unspecified origin ) which leads to superconductivity is stronger than in conventional superconductivity . in this way fermion pairs form before they bose condense , much as in a bose superfluid . in support of this viewpoint for the cuprates",
    "are the observations that : ( i ) the coherence length @xmath3 for superconductivity is anomalously short , around @xmath4  as compared with @xmath5  for a typical superconductor .",
    "moreover ( ii ) the transition temperatures are anomalously high , and ( iii ) the systems are close to two dimensional ( 2d ) ( where pre - formed pair or fluctuation effects are expected to be important ) .",
    "finally , ( iv ) the pseudogap has the same @xmath2-wave symmetry @xcite as the superconducting order parameter @xcite and there seems to be a smooth evolution of the excitation gap from above to below @xmath1 .    to investigate this bcs - bec crossover scenario we have the particular good fortune today of having a new class of atomic physics experiments involving ultracold trapped fermions which , in the presence of an applied magnetic field , have been found to have a continuously tunable attractive interaction . at high fields the system exhibits bcs - like superfluidity , whereas at low fields one sees bec - like behavior .",
    "this review presents a consolidated study of both the pseudogap phase of the cuprates and recent developments in ultracold fermionic superfluids .",
    "the emphasis of these cold atom experiments is on the so - called unitary or strong scattering regime , which is between the bec and bcs limits , but on the fermionic side .",
    "the superfluid state in this intermediate regime is also referred to in the literature as a  resonant superfluid \" @xcite . here",
    "we prefer to describe it as the  pseudogap phase \" , since that is more descriptive of the physics and underlines the close analogy with high @xmath1 systems . throughout this review",
    "we will use these three descriptive phrases interchangeably .",
    "bcs - bec crossover theory is based on the observations of eagles @xcite and leggett @xcite who independently noted that the bcs ground state wavefunction @xmath6 had a greater applicability than had been appreciated at the time of its original proposal by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) . as the strength of the attractive pairing interaction @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) between fermions",

    "an additional advantage of this formalism is that bogoliubov de gennes theory , a real space implementation of this ground state , can be used to address the effects of inhomogeneity and external fields at @xmath17 .",
    "this has been widely used in the crossover literature .    within this ground state",

    "nozieres and schmitt - rink were the first @xcite to address non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "we will outline some of their conclusions later in this review .",
    "randeria and co - workers reformulated the approach of nozieres and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) and moreover , raised the interesting possibility that crossover physics might be relevant to high temperature superconductors @xcite . subsequently other workers have applied this picture to the high @xmath1 cuprates @xcite and ultracold fermions @xcite as well as formulated alternative schemes @xcite for addressing @xmath18 .",
    "importantly , a number of experimentalists , most notably uemura @xcite , have claimed evidence in support @xcite of the bcs - bec crossover picture for high @xmath1 materials .",

    "it will be stressed throughout this review that gaps in the fermionic spectrum and bosonic degrees of freedom are two sides of the same coin .",

    "then , for statistical reasons these bosonic degrees of freedom ultimately are driven to condense at @xmath27 , as in bec .",

    "while the high @xmath1 community has focused on pseudogap effects above @xmath1 , there is a good case to be made that these effects also persist below .",
    "stm data @xcite taken below @xmath1 within a vortex core indicate that there is a clear depletion of the density of states around the fermi energy in the normal phase within the core .",

    "the focus is on temperatures below @xmath1 .",
    "most importantly , this figure indicates that the @xmath0 dependence in @xmath24 varies dramatically as the stoichiometry changes .",

    "figure [ fig:10 ] then indicates that , _ despite the highly non - universal behavior for @xmath46 , the superfluid density does not make large excursions from its bcs- predicted form_. this is difficult to understand if the fermionic degrees of freedom through @xmath46 are dominating at all @xmath34 .",
    "rather this figure suggests that something other than fermionic excitations is responsible for the disappearance of superconductivity , particularly in the regime where @xmath46 is relatively constant in @xmath0 . at the very least pseudogap effects",

    "the phase diagram also suggests that pseudogap effects become stronger with underdoping .",
    "how does one accommodate this in the bcs - bec crossover scenario ? at the simplest level one may argue that as the system approaches the mott insulating limit , fermions are less mobile and the effectiveness of the attraction increases .",
    "in making the connection between the strength of the attraction and the variable @xmath34 in the cuprate phase diagram we will argue that it is appropriate to simply fit @xmath48 . in this review",

    "it also seems to be complementary to the bcs - bec crossover scenario .",
    "it is understood that both components are important in high @xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "it should be stressed that hole concentration @xmath34 in the cuprates plays the role of applied magnetic field in the cold atom system .",
    "these are the external parameters which serve to tune the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "is there any evidence for bosonic degrees of freedom in the normal state of high @xmath1 superconductors ?",
    "the answer is unequivocally yes : _ meta - stable bosons are observable as superconducting fluctuations_. these effects are enhanced in the presence of the quasi - two dimensional lattice structure of these materials . in the underdoped case , one can think of @xmath26 as marking the onset of preformed pairs which are closely related to fluctuations of conventional superconductivity theory , but which are made more robust as a result of bcs - bec crossover effects , that is , stronger pairing attraction .",
    "a number of people have argued @xcite that fluctuating normal state vortices are responsible for the anomalous transport behavior of the pseudogap regime .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that these data may alternatively be interpreted as suggesting that bosonic degrees of freedom are present in the normal state .",
    "there has been an exciting string of developments over the past few years in studies of ultracold fermionic atoms , in particular , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which have been trapped and cooled via magnetic and optical means .",
    "typically these traps contain @xmath51 atoms at very low densities @xmath52 @xmath53 . here the fermi temperature in a trap can be estimated to be of the order of a micro - kelvin .",
    "it was argued on the basis of bcs theory alone @xcite , and rather early on ( 1997 ) , that the temperatures associated with the superfluid phases may be attainable in these trapped gases .",
    "this set off a search for the  holy grail \" of fermionic superfluidity .",
    "that a fermi degenerate state could be reached at all is itself quite remarkable ; this was was first reported @xcite by jin and demarco in 1999 . by late 2002",
    "reports of unusual hydrodynamics in a degenerate fermi gas indicated that strong interactions were present @xcite .",
    "this strongly interacting fermi gas ( associated with the unitary scattering regime ) has attracted widespread attention independent of the search for superfluidity , because it appears to be a prototype for analogous systems in nuclear physics @xcite and in quark - gluon plasmas @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig:24tosi ] , thus , underlines the fact that fermionic degrees of freedom ( or compositeness ) are still playing a role at these magnetic fields .",
    "there are predictions in the literature @xcite that one needs to achieve @xmath209 somewhat less than @xmath210 ( experimentally , the smallest values for these experiments are 0.3 and 0.7 for the various groups ) in order to approach the true bosonic limit . at this point , then , the simple mean field theory will no longer be adequate .",
    "indeed , there are other indications @xcite of the breakdown of this mean field in the extreme bec limit which are , physically , reflected in the width of the particle density profiles .",

    "nevertheless , uncertainties remain .",
    "theories which posit a different ground state will need to be compared with the four experiments discussed here .",
    "it is , finally , quite possible that incomplete @xmath17 condensation will become evident in future experiments .",
    "if so , an alternative wavefunction will have to be contemplated @xcite .",
    "what appears to be clear from the current experiments is that , just as in high @xmath1 superconductors , the ultracold fermionic superfluids exhibit pseudogap effects .",
    "these are seen in thermodynamics , in rf spectra and in the temperature dependence of the profiles ( through the noncondensed pair contributions ) . moreover , while not discussed here , at finite @xmath0 , damping of the collective mode frequencies seems to change qualitatively @xcite at a temperature which is close to the estimated @xmath26 .",
    "looking to the future , at an experimental level , new pairing gap spectroscopies appear to be emerging at a fairly rapid pace @xcite .",
    "these will further test the present and subsequent theories .",
    "indeed , recently , a probe of the closed channel fraction @xcite has been analyzed @xcite within the present framework and has led to good quantitative agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "the high @xmath1 superconductors are different from the ultracold fermionic superfluids in one key respect ; they are @xmath2-wave superconductors and their electronic dispersion is associated with a quasi - two dimensional tight binding lattice . in many ways",
    "this is not a profound difference from the perspective of bcs - bec crossover .",
    "figure [ fig:23 ] shows a plot of the two important temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath26 as a function of increasing attractive coupling . on",
    "the left is bcs and the right is pg .",
    "the bec regime is not visible .",
    "this is because @xmath1 disappears before it can be accessed .",
    "this disappearance of @xmath1 is relatively easy to understand . because the @xmath2-wave pairs are more extended ( than their @xmath54-wave counterparts )",
    "they experience pauli principle repulsion more intensely .",
    "consequently the pairs localize ( their mass is infinite ) well before the fermionic chemical potential is negative @xcite .",
    "the competition between @xmath26 and @xmath1 , in which as @xmath26 increases , @xmath1 decreases , is also apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig:23 ] .",
    "this is a consequence of pseudogap effects .",
    "more specifically , the pairs become heavier as the gap increases in the fermionic spectrum , competing with the increase of @xmath1 due to the increasing pairing strength .",

    "[ fig:23 ] are considerably smaller than their three dimensional analogues .",
    "thus , pseudogap effects are intensified , just as conventional fluctuation effects are more apparent in low dimensional systems . this may be one of the reasons why the cuprates are among the first materials to clearly reveal pseudogap physics .",
    "moreover , the present calculations show that in a strictly 2d material , @xmath1 is driven to zero , by bosonic or fluctuation effects .",
    "this is a direct reflection of the fact that there is no bose condensation in 2d .",
    "the presence of pseudogap effects raises an interesting set of issues surrounding the signatures of the transition which the high @xmath1 community has wrestled with , much as the cold atom community is doing today .",
    "for a charged superconductor there is no difficulty in measuring the superfluid density , through the electrodynamic response .",
    "thus one knows with certainty where @xmath1 is .",
    "nevertheless , people have been concerned about precisely how the onset of phase coherence is reflected in thermodynamics , such as @xmath213 or in the fermionic spectral function , given that a gap is already present at the onset of superconductivity .",
    "one understands how phase coherence shows up in bcs theory , since the ordered state is always accompanied by the appearance of an excitation gap .    to address these coherence effects",
    "one has to introduce a distinction @xcite between the self energy associated with noncondensed and condensed pairs .",
    "this distinction is blurred by the approximations made in section [ sec:2b ] . within this",

    "agreement between theory and experiment is satisfactory .      in some ways",
    "the subtleties of phase coherent pairing are even more perplexing in the context of electrodynamics .",
    "figure [ fig:10 ] presents a paradox in which the excitation gap for fermions appears to have little to do with the behavior of the superfluid density .",
    "this superfluid density can be readily computed within the bcs - bec crossover scenario @xcite .",
    "particularly important is to include all excitations of the condensate in a fully consistent fashion , compatible with thermodynamics , and which is also manifestly gauge invariant . to make contact with electrodynamic experiments",
    ", one has to introduce the variable @xmath34 and this is done via a fit to @xmath48 in the phase diagram .",
    "in addition it is also necessary to fit @xmath214 to experiment , and we do so here , noting that @xcite the uemura relation @xmath215 no longer holds for very underdoped samples @xcite . by fitting these @xmath34-dependent quantities",
    "we are , in effect accounting for at least some aspects of mott physics . the paradox raised by fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] is resolved by noting that there are bosonic excitations of the condensate @xcite and that these become more marked with underdoping , as pseudogap effects increase . in this way",
    "@xmath115 does not exclusively reflect the fermionic gap , but rather vanishes  prematurely \" before this gap is zero , as a result of pair excitations of the condensate .",
    "this theory can be quantitatively compared with experiment .",

    "there it was argued that @xmath217 , so that the lower critical field effectively measures the in - plane superfluid density .",

    "the left hand figures plot @xmath216 vs @xmath0 and the right hand figures correspond to a rescaling of this function in the form @xmath219 vs @xmath220 .",
    "theoretically , it is found that the fermionic contribution leads to a linear @xmath0 dependence at low @xmath0 , associated with @xmath2-wave pairing , whereas the bosonic term introduces a @xmath221 term .",
    "quite remarkably even when the uemura relation no longer holds , there is still a  universality \" in the normalized plots as shown in both theory and experiment by the right hand figures .",
    "it should be noted that the experimental plot contains ( at @xmath222 ) a slightly different cuprate phase known as the ortho - ii phase , which does not lie on the universal curves .",
    "the universality found here can be understood as associated with the fact that @xmath223 , rather than @xmath224 , is the fundamental energy scale in @xmath225 .",
    "the reason that @xmath224 is not the sole energy scale is that bosonic degrees of freedom are also present , and help to drive @xmath115 to zero at @xmath1 . by contrast , fermi - liquid based approaches @xcite assume that the fermions are the only relevant excitations , and they account for this data by introducing a phenomenological parameter @xmath226 which corresponds to the effective charge of the fermionic quasi - particles .",
    "as anticipated in earlier theoretical calculations @xcite the bosonic contribution begins to dominate in severely underdoped systems so that the slope @xmath227 ( associated with the lowest temperatures reached experimentally ) should _ decrease _ with underdoping .",
    "although observed a number of years after this prediction , this is precisely what is seen experimentally , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:27 ] . here",
    "the inset plots the experimental counterpart data .",
    "it can be seen that theory and experiment are in reasonably good quantitative agreement .",
    "this theoretical viewpoint is very different from a  fermi - liquid \" based treatment of the superconducting state , for which the strong decrease in the slope of @xmath228 was not expected . within the present formalism , the optical conductivity @xcite @xmath229 is similarly modified @xcite to include bosonic as well as fermionic contributions .",
    "the existence of noncondensed pair states below @xmath1 affects thermodynamics , in the same way that electrodynamics is affected , as discussed above .",
    "moreover , one can predict @xcite that the @xmath230 dispersion will lead to ideal bose gas power laws in thermodynamical and transport properties .",
    "these will be present in addition to the usual power laws or ( for @xmath54-wave ) exponential temperature dependencies associated with the fermionic quasi - particles .",
    "note that the @xmath230 dependence is dictated by the ground state of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) .",
    "clearly this mean field like state is inapplicable in the extreme bec limit , where , presumably inter - boson effects become important and lead to a linear dispersion .",
    "presumably , in the pg or near - bec regimes , fermionic degrees of freedom are still dominant and it is reasonable to apply eq .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) .",

    "@xmath47 will acquire a @xmath221 contribution in addition to the usual fermionic terms .",
    "by contrast , for spin singlet states , there is no explicit pair contribution to the knight shift . in this way",
    "the low @xmath0 knight shift reflects only the fermions and exhibits a scaling with @xmath233 at low temperatures .",
    "experimentally , in the cuprates , one usually sees a finite low @xmath0 contribution to @xmath231 .",

    "indeed , the different pairbreaking sensitivities of @xmath26 and @xmath1 are usually proposed to support the notion that the pseudogap has nothing to do with superconductivity . to counter this incorrect inference ,",
    "a detailed set of studies was conducted , ( based on the bec - bcs scenario ) , of pairbreaking in the presence of impurities @xcite and of magnetic fields @xcite .",

    "in addition in the unitary regime , rf spectroscopy - based pairing gap studies @xcite , as well as density profile @xcite and thermodynamic studies @xcite all appear to be compatible with this theory .",
