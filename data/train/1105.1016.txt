    "in 1962 josephson predicted that a dissipationless current ( supercurrent ) could flow in a junction between two superconductors ( s ) weakly coupled by an insulating barrier,@xcite which was confirmed experimentally shortly afterwards by anderson and rowell.@xcite soon after this confirmation , it became clear that this phenomenon , referred to as the dc josephson effect , could take place in a variety of superconducting weak links such as dayem bridges , sns junctions , where n corresponds to a normal metal bridge , or large point contacts.@xcite the only difference between these systems lies on the exact current phase relation ( cpr ) , which depends on the characteristics of the constriction linking the superconducting leads.@xcite    in recent years , the dc josephson effect has been investigated in novel superconducting junctions with weak links based on atomic contacts,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite fullerenes,@xcite semiconductor nanowires,@xcite or graphene.@xcite some of these nanostructures fall into the category of a superconducting quantum point contact ( sqpc ) , where the constriction has a length much smaller than the superconducting coherence length . in this limit , and in the absence of strong interactions in the constriction , the dc josephson effect can be described in a unified manner using two basic concepts of mesoscopic physics , namely the concepts of conduction channels and andreev bound states . in the normal state ,",
    "the coherent transport through a mesoscopic system can be described in terms of the independent contributions of the eigenfunctions of the transmission matrix from the structure , known as conduction channels , and these contributions are determined by the corresponding transmission coefficients @xmath0 . in the superconducting state , the electrons ( holes ) transmitted in a conduction channel are andreev reflected at the electrodes as holes ( electrons ) in the same channel .",
    "this process is successively repeated in both electrodes leading to the formation of a pair of bound states in the gap region .",
    "these are known as the andreev bound states ( abss ) . in the case of a single - channel sqpc with transmission @xmath1",
    ", the energies of the abss are given by@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the superconducting gap and @xmath4 is the phase difference between the order parameters on both sides of the junction .",
    "in equilibrium , these two states carry opposite supercurrents @xmath5 , which are weighted by the occupation of the abss ( determined by the fermi function ) . in the case of a multichannel sqpc , the supercurrent is simply given by the sum of the contributions from the individual channels.@xcite",
    "this unified microscopic picture of the dc josephson effect has been confirmed experimentally in the context of atomic contacts by della rocca and coworkers.@xcite in particular , these authors measured the cpr of an atomic contact placed along with a tunnel junction in a small superconducting loop and found an excellent agreement with the theory using the independently determined transmission coefficients . at this stage",
    ", one may wonder whether it is possible to control the occupation of abss of a sqpc with an external field , and in turn to control the supercurrent .",
    "this is the main issue explored in this work and for this purpose , we present here an extensive theoretical analysis of the supercurrent and the dynamics of the abss of a sqpc under microwave irradiation .",
    "this is a basic problem in mesoscopic superconductivity , which is also relevant for the field of quantum computing since the abss of a sqpc have been proposed to be used as the two states of a qubit.@xcite in this proposal , a microwave field can be used for the spectroscopy of the two - level system or to probe its quantum state by current measurements .",
    "the microwave - assisted supercurrent in sqpcs is often discussed in the framework of the adiabatic approximation ( see section ii ) , where one assumes that the abss follow adiabatically the microwave field .",
    "this approximation does not take into account the possible transitions between the abss and therefore , if fails to describe the current at high frequencies or for highly transmissive contacts , where the energy difference between the states can be rather small .",
    "the first microscopic analysis of this problem for a sqpc of an arbitrary transparency was reported by shumeiko and coworkers.@xcite these authors studied the limit of weak fields and predicted the possibility to have a large suppression of the current due to resonant transitions between the abss . later , other aspects of this problem , including the dynamics of the abss , have been addressed focusing on the linear response regime.@xcite a complete solution of this problem , valid for an arbitrary range of parameters , has only been reported very recently.@xcite in this latter work , we developed a theory of the supercurrent through a microwave - irradiated sqpc in the framework of the keldysh - green function technique .",
    "this theory allowed us to put forward new predictions such as the evolution of the cpr with the radiation power and the possibility to enhance the critical current at finite temperatures by irradiating the junction . here , we describe in detail this theory ( see section iv ) and , in particular , we present new analytical results that elucidate the origin of the microwave - enhanced supercurrents .    in the process of understanding the results of the exact theory , we are confronted with the question of to what extent the physics of microwave - irradiated sqpcs can be understood in terms of just the dynamics of the abss , i.e. , in terms of a natural extension of the argument described in the previous paragraphs for the case of a junction in equilibrium . in order to answer this question , we make use of the two - level hamiltonians of a sqpc existing in the literature@xcite and we compare the results with the exact theory .",
    "this comparison serves in turn to establish the range of validity of these two - level models .",
    "it is worth stressing that within these models the computation of the dc properties such as the supercurrent or the average occupation of the abss for arbitrary radiation is a highly non - trivial task . in order to carry it out ,",
    "we have developed a new powerful method which allows us to compute any dc quantity in an arbitrary two - level system driven out of equilibrium by a periodic perturbation .",
    "this method is described in section iii and it constitutes one of the main results of this work . with the help of this method , we show that with the hamiltonian of ref .   one can nicely reproduce the exact results at low temperatures and low radiation powers . moreover",
    ", this analysis allows us to obtain analytical results for the supercurrent dips produced by microwave - induced transitions between the abss .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the equilibrium properties of a sqpc as well as the basic results of the adiabatic approximation . in section iii",
    "we study the dynamics of the abss under a microwave field within the two - level hamiltonian of ref .  .",
    "in particular , we describe a novel method that allows us to obtain the cpr for any power and frequency of the external field , and we also derive analytical expressions for the supercurrent beyond the rotating wave approximation . in section",
    "iv we discuss the keldysh - green function technique , which describes the supercurrent for an arbitrary range of parameters , including also the contribution of the continuum of states outside the gap region .",
    "we present a detailed comparison of the results of this technique at zero temperature with those obtained with the two - level model .",
    "moreover , we analyze in detail the phenomenon of microwave - enhanced supercurrent at finite temperatures , for which we present analytical results . finally , section v is devoted to some additional discussions and to summarizing the main results of this work .",
    "we consider a sqpc consisting of two identical superconducting electrodes with an energy gap @xmath3 , linked by a single conduction channel of transmission @xmath1 . our main goal is to compute the supercurrent through this system when it is subjected to a monochromatic microwave field of frequency @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the external radiation generates a time - dependent voltage @xmath7,@xcite where the amplitude @xmath8 depends on the power of the external radiation source , and eventually also on the polarization of the radiation .",
    "according to the josephson relation , this voltage induces a time - dependent superconducting phase difference given by @xmath9 where @xmath4 is the dc part of the phase and @xmath10 is a parameter that measures the strength of the coupling to the electromagnetic field and it is used here as a parameter to be determined by comparing with the experiments .    as explained in the introduction , in the absence of microwaves",
    "the supercurrent can be expressed as a sum of the contributions of the two abss as @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the fermi distribution function , which yields@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq - abs ] ) and @xmath15 is the temperature . in the tunnel regime ( @xmath16 )",
    ", this expression reduces to the sinusoidal cpr given by the ambegaokar - baratoff formula:@xcite @xmath17 , with @xmath18 . at perfect transparency ( @xmath19 ) , this expression reproduces the kulik - omelyanchuk formula:@xcite @xmath20 . here , @xmath21 is the zero - temperature critical current for @xmath19 and we frequently use it below to normalize the supercurrent in the different graphs . according to eq .",
    "( [ ieq ] ) , at zero temperature only the lower abs contributes to the supercurrent @xmath22 , while at a finite temperature the negative contribution from the upper abs leads to a decrease of the total supercurrent .",
    "the simplest approach to compute the supercurrent in the presence of the microwave field is the so - called adiabatic approximation.@xcite in this approximation one assumes that the abss follow adiabatically the ac drive and there are no direct transitions between them .",
    "thus , the cpr in this approximation is obtained by replacing the stationary phase @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ ieq ] ) by the time - dependent phase @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ eq - phi ] ) , which leads to the following result @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the harmonics of the equilibrium cpr of eq .",
    "( [ ieq ] ) and @xmath26 is the zero - order bessel function of the first kind . notice that the current in this approximation does not depend explicitly on the radiation frequency .",
    "we illustrate the results of this approximation in fig .",
    "[ fig_iad ] for the zero - temperature case .",
    "in particular , in the two upper panels we show the cpr ( obtained from eq .  ) for two different transmissions and several values of the @xmath27 parameter ( related to the microwave power ) .",
    "panel ( a ) corresponds to the tunnel limit ( @xmath28 ) where the cpr is sinusoidal irrespective of the radiation power , while in panel ( b ) we show the results for a high transmission of @xmath29 . in this latter case",
    ", the critical current is reached at different values of the phase depending on the value of @xmath27 .",
    "notice that no matter the value of the phase @xmath4 , the magnitude of the supercurrent is always suppressed by the microwaves as compared with the zero - field result ( @xmath30 ) , which is true at any temperature .",
    "with respect to the behavior of the critical current @xmath31 , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_iad](c ) , it decays in a non - monotonic manner , as governed by the bessel function @xmath26 .",
    "( a ) and @xmath29 ( b ) .",
    "the different curves correspond to different values of @xmath27 as indicated in the graphs .",

    "( c ) the zero - temperature critical current as a function of @xmath27 for three different values of the transmission @xmath1 .",
    "notice that critical current is normalized by its value in the absence of microwaves.[fig_iad ] ]",
    "it is instructive to start our analysis towards a microscopic theory by restricting ourselves to the study of the contribution of abss , ignoring for the moment the continuum part of the spectrum .",
    "this can be done with the help of the two - level models that have been derived in refs .   and to describe the dynamics of a sqpc under external ac fields .",
    "the models of these two references coincide at equilibrium , but they differ slightly when the phase depends on time . in particular , the model of ref",
    ".   ensures charge neutrality , while the model of ref .",
    "for this reason , we base our discussion here on the model put forward by zazunov and coworkers.@xcite in this model , the sqpc is described by the @xmath34 hamiltonian @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath23 is the time - dependent phase given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - phi ] ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is written in the ballistic basis of right- and left moving electrons , which are eigenvectors of the current operator in the perfectly transmitting case ( @xmath19 ) .",

    "this is the basis where the hamiltonian of eq .",

    "moreover , in the previous two equations , and in the rest of this section , we set @xmath46 .    the corresponding current operator can be written as @xmath47 where the prime in @xmath48 means derivative with respect to the argument ( the time - dependent phase in this case ) . to obtain the expectation value of the current at different times , eq .",
    "needs to be solved . despite the apparent simplicity , this task has nontrivial aspects : straightforward numerical approaches run into problems , as both very fast ( @xmath49 ) and very slow ( @xmath50 ) time scales can be simultaneously present .",
    "no closed - form analytical solution can be obtained either,@xcite and the significantly nonlinear coupling to the drive makes it more difficult to derive approximations via standard routes.@xcite    focusing our analysis on time - averaged quantities , we can obtain accurate analytical and numerical results via a systematic floquet - type approach .",
    "we are interested in two physical quantities : the dc current @xmath51 and the time - averaged populations of the andreev levels @xmath52 below , we show how to obtain @xmath53 , although the method described can as well be used to compute any other time - averaged quantity , including @xmath54 .",
    "we first introduce a modified hamiltonian @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a parameter conjugate to the observable , and it is set to zero at the end of the calculation . the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath57 can be formally written by introducing the time evolution operator @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 indicates time ordering and @xmath61 is the state vector at @xmath62 .",
    "we define now the generating function : @xmath63 one can easily check that the dc current defined in eq .",
    "can be written as @xmath64 thus , we only need to compute the function @xmath65 , or , equivalently , the evolution operator @xmath66 .",
    "since our hamiltonian is periodic in time with a period @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 , we can define two periodic ( floquet ) states @xmath69 via the eigenvalue problem @xmath70 the symmetry of the two eigenvalues follows here from the fact that @xmath71 and @xmath72 $ ] are traceless , and @xmath73 is unitary .",

    "it is easy to compute and it handles the fast and slow time scales of the problem separately . in order to obtain the dc current , one needs first to integrate the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian of eq .",

    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ 2level - numerics ] a few examples of the cpr of a highly transmissive channel ( @xmath29 ) computed with the numerical recipe that we have just described.@xcite the upper panels of this figure show the cpr for a moderate power ( @xmath86 ) and three different values of the microwave frequency . for comparison",
    ", we also show the result obtained with the adiabatic approximation of eq .",
    "( [ iad ] ) .",
    "as one can see , the main difference is the appearance in the results of the two - level model of a series of dips at certain values of the phases where the current is largely suppressed .",
    "it is easy to understand that such dips are due to microwave - induced transitions between the abss .",
    "these transitions enhance the population of the upper abs , which at zero temperature would be empty otherwise , and at the same time they reduce the occupation of the lower abs .",
    "this redistribution of the quasiparticles in turn results in a suppression of the current .",
    "the microwave - induced transitions occur with the highest probability when the distance in energy between the abss ( the andreev gap ) is equal to a multiple of the photon energy , i.e. , when @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the number of photons involved in the transition .",

    "this interpretation of the origin of the dips in the cpr can be corroborated by a direct analysis of the occupations of the abss .",
    "following the same numerical recipe , we have also computed the average occupation of the upper abs , @xmath90 , for the examples shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ 2level - numerics ] .",
    "the results can be seen in the lower panels of this figure and , as one can observe , there is a clear one - to - one correspondence between the current dips and the enhancement of the time - averaged population of the upper state . in particular , whenever the upper state reaches a population equal to @xmath91 , the current vanishes exactly .",
    "the method described above is not only very convenient for numerical calculations , but it also provides a route to obtain analytical results . in what follows , we show how this method can be used , in particular , to gain a further insight into the microwave - induced supercurrent dips . to proceed , it is useful to first rewrite eq .   in a more convenient form . in particular",
    ", we would like to avoid the calculation of eigenvectors in this equation .",
    "this can be done by noting that the unperturbed hamiltonian   obeys @xmath92 consequently , @xmath93 , and the dc current given by eq .",

    "@xmath124 where the resonant frequency @xmath125 equals the unperturbed andreev level spacing @xmath126 ( up to first order in @xmath27 ) , and @xmath127 is the corresponding rabi frequency .",
    "this expression tells us that the current vanishes exactly at the resonant condition @xmath128 and that the width of the current dip is given by @xmath129 , which is linear in @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , its form clearly suggests that the populations of the two states undergo rabi oscillations with the frequency @xmath129 , as usual in two - state systems , and the time - averaged populations of the abs coincide at the resonance . as a consequence , the dc current drops to zero at the resonance , a result that qualitatively coincides with the prediction in ref .  .",
    "we can also determine the dc current at the higher resonances , for example for @xmath130 .",
    "in this case we work in the frame corresponding to @xmath131 .",
    "as the resonance is due to two - photon processes , terms up to order @xmath132 must be taken into account , which requires including the first two terms in eq .  .",

    "as above , the current is obtained from the eigenvalues of @xmath135 , and it adopts the form @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 . here , one can observe that the resonant frequency is shifted from the position @xmath139 by two contributions : the first arises from nonlinearities , and the second is the bloch - siegert shift.@xcite    one can also go further and compute the dc current around resonances @xmath140 , although this gets progressively more cumbersome as an increasing number of terms are required in the magnus expansion , reflecting the increasing number of allowed multiphoton processes generated by the nonlinearities .",

    "are mainly related to the fact that it does not take into account the contribution of the continuum of states outside the gap region .",

    "<S> we present here an extensive theoretical analysis of the supercurrent of a superconducting point contact of arbitrary transparency in the presence of a microwave field . </S>",
    "<S> our study is mainly based on two different approaches : a two - level model that describes the dynamics of the andreev bound states in these systems and a fully microscopic method based on the keldysh - green function technique . </S>",
    "<S> this combination provides both a deep insight into the physics of irradiated josephson junctions and quantitative predictions for arbitrary range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the main predictions of our analysis are : ( i ) for weak fields and low temperatures , the microwaves can induce transitions between the andreev states leading to a large suppression of the supercurrent at certain values of the phase , ( ii ) at strong fields , the current - phase relation is strongly distorted and the corresponding critical current does not follow a simple bessel - function - like behavior , and ( iii ) at finite temperature , the microwave field can enhance the critical current by means of transitions connecting the continuum of states outside the gap region and the andreev states inside the gap . </S>",
    "<S> our study is of relevance for a large variety of superconducting weak links as well as for the proposals of using the andreev bound states of a point contact for quantum computing applications . </S>"
