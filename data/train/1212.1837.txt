    "[ fig : structure ] , middle panel ) identified translucent blue crystals of diaboleite mixed with opaque white crystals of other minerals .",
    "both blue and white crystals were detached from the support and separated manually .",

    "magnetic couplings in diaboleite , as well as different aspects of its structural distortions , were analyzed by density - functional theory ( dft ) band - structure calculations performed in the ` fplo`@xcite and ` vasp`@xcite codes that implement basis sets of local orbitals and projected augmented waves,@xcite respectively .",

    "other elements amenable to the ice - oes determination ( including transition metals , but excluding o , h , and cl ) are below the detection limit of 0.1  wt.% .",
    "these estimates are in reasonable agreement with the expected chemical composition ( 67.2  wt.% pb , 10.3  wt.% cu ) , although slight deviations in the pb and cu content , as well as the presence of ba , signal subtle variations in the stoichiometry of the diaboleite phase .",
    "the rietveld refinement of the atomic positions resulted in reasonable atomic displacement parameters ( adps ) of pb , cl , and o , @xmath44  a@xmath45 ( the hydrogen position was not refined).@xcite however , the notably higher adp of cu ( @xmath46  a@xmath45 ) suggested the missing scattering density at the cu position .",
    "considering the nearly isotropic thermal ellipsoid ( @xmath47  a@xmath45 , @xmath48  a@xmath45 along the @xmath49 and @xmath50 directions , respectively ) , the large adp of cu can not be explained by a displacement of cu from its position on the four - fold axis , and should be rather understood as the formation of vacancies .",
    "indeed , as the adp was fixed to @xmath51  a@xmath45 , the refined cu occupancy converged to 0.942(4 ) indicating the deficiency of cu atoms in the diaboleite structure .",
    "the formation of cu vacancies conforms to the underestimated cu content from the chemical analysis that yields about 10  % cu deficiency in the diaboleite sample .",
    "the formation of cu vacancies is justified by both powder xrd and chemical analysis .",
    "indeed , the missing scattering density in xrd could be otherwise explained by the substitution of a lighter element in the cu position .",
    "however , the chemical analysis does not show detectable amounts of any foreign elements that are capable of replacing cu in the diaboleite structure .",
    "trace amounts of ba are likely related to the pb / ba substitution , which is favored by the similar ionic radii of these elements .",
    "the amount of the substituted ba is well below 1  % , so it does not show up in the xrd refinement .",
    "another conspicuous feature of the natural diaboleite sample is the sizable broadening of the @xmath52 reflections with non - zero indices @xmath43 and/or @xmath26 .",
    "this effect is well seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : xrd ] where , for example , the 310 reflection is much broader than the neighboring 003 peak.@xcite anisotropic reflection broadening can be understood as the formation of stacking faults in the layered crystal structure of diaboleite .",

    "this supercell with 25% cu deficiency should be representative for the actual diaboleite sample that features @xmath62% of cu vacancies .",
    "the calculations for lower concentrations of vacancies would require even larger supercells , which are hardly feasible for an accurate computational treatment .    the formation of cu vacancies enhances the bonding and reduces the coordination number of pb atoms around the vacancy . in stoichiometric diaboleite , each pb atom is surrounded by four oxygens with the pb  o separations of 2.45  a. in cu - deficient diaboleite , the pb@xmath60 atoms ( fig .",

    "o distances are shortened to 2.32  a and 2.40  a , respectively .",
    "the bond to the third oxygen atom extends to 2.53  a , whereas the fourth bond is either lost ( for pb@xmath60 atoms adjacent to the oxygen vacancy ) or stretched up to 2.63  a ( for the oxygen atom of the water molecule ) .",
    "this way , the lengths of the bonds are redistributed , and bonding requirements of pb can be satisfied , even though one out of four oxygen atoms is removed from the crystal structure . the void formed between the two pb@xmath60 atoms ( fig .",

    "it can be ascribed to the `` localization '' of @xmath63 lone pairs that form a non - bonding region in the crystal structure.@xcite    the formation of cu vacancies can be considered as the removal of cuo from the diaboleite structure .",
