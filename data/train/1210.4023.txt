    "the determination of depths of formation of the observed stokes parameter profiles for magnetically sensitive fraunhofer lines still remains a topical problem of the spectral analysis which is used for obtaining information on the fine structure of magnetic field in the solar photosphere .",
    "the problem of the depth of line formation may be considered completely solved for the fraunhofer lines which are formed in the regions without a magnetic field , in the so - called quiet photosphere , while the present state of the problem dealing with the depths of formation of the stokes line profiles still remains unsatisfactory .    in observational programs for studying the magnetic field structure in the photospheric layers of the sun , approximate estimates",
    "are usually used for selecting lines with necessary characteristics .",
    "thus , for example , to determine the depth of formation of a fraunhofer line , its equivalent width is estimated .",
    "it is considered that the larger the equivalent width the higher in the atmosphere the line is formed .",
    "the magnetic and temperature sensitivity of a line is determined by the value of such atomic parameters of the line as the excitation potential , ionization potential , and land factor .",
    "the smaller the sum of potentials the more sensitive the line is to the temperature , and the greater the land factor the more magnetically sensitive the line is .",
    "though it is possible to get approximate estimates from such reasonings , more reliable information on the depths of formation of the fraunhofer line profiles and the stokes parameter profiles is necessary for a detailed investigation of relationships between the physical parameters of the atmosphere and the depth .",
    "it is not long ago that we have begun the theoretical investigation of the stokes parameters of magnetically sensitive fraunhofer lines .",
    "the calculation algorithm for the stokes profiles , for contribution and response functions was developed on the basis of the theory of line formation in a magnetic field for the condition of the local thermodynamic equilibrium ; the theory was developed first by unno and improved by rachkovskii , beckers , and landi deglinnocenti .",
    "the algorithm and structure of the calculation program spansatm can be found in our paper @xcite .",
    "this program was produced on the basis of the spansat program @xcite intended for calculation and analysis of line profiles in stellar atmospheres .",
    "the program system spansatm enables to carry out the complete analysis of magnetically active photospheric lines in the solar spectrum .",
    "our paper @xcite gives the results of investigations of the effect of physical conditions in a magnetic medium and of atomic parameters of lines on the shape of the stokes profiles and on the magnetic broadening of the fraunhofer lines . in the present paper , the attention",
    "is concentrated mainly on the study of properties of the depression contribution functions and on determination of the depths where the stokes profiles of photospheric lines are formed .",
    "the results of analysis of the response functions of the stokes parameters will be given in a next paper .",
    "when the depths of line formation are calculated , the contribution functions which describe the contribution of atmospheric layers to the observed value of relative absorption in the spectral line are usually used . besides the contribution functions , the response functions are used in the interpretation of observations .",
    "they serve for determination of the response of an observed quantity to a given disturbance .",
    "these two functions supplement well each other and together they can give a complete enough information about physical conditions in the medium where spectral line profiles are formed .",
    "depression contribution functions are the functions which show what part of the radiation emerging at the surface ( relative to the continuum intensity @xmath0 ) is absorbed by each of the atmospheric layers in a given region @xmath1 of the spectral line .",
    "this function defines the value of the contribution to the relative absorption @xmath2 { / } { i_c } $ ] . here",
    "@xmath3 is the intensity of the radiation emerging in the region @xmath1 of the line .",
    "the depression contribution function is equal to zero when the absorption coefficient in the line is zero and the source function in the line @xmath4 is not equal to the intensity of continuous radiation , i.e. , @xmath4 should be greater or smaller than @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "the depression contribution function is significant if there are atoms which absorb in the given line and the intensities of re - emitted and absorbed radiation are different .",
    "it is no mere chance that we have chosen the depression contribution functions as a tool for investigating the regions where the line absorption processes are localized and for determining the depths of formation of absorption lines .",
    "this choice is based on the results of gurtovenko and sheminova @xcite and conclusions of magain @xcite , where a formal solution of the radiation transfer equation was obtained for a relative line depression in the integral form and where the integrand was shown to be the only correct depression contribution function fit for determining the depth of formation of an absorption line .",
    "gurtovenko and sarychev @xcite demonstrate that a depression contribution function proposed earlier which was derived using the unsld - pecker procedure of weight functions is identical to the depression contribution function from @xcite . at present , the depression contribution function proposed first by gurtovenko , ratnikova , and de jager @xcite and substantiated theoretically by magain @xcite is widely used in calculating the depths of formation of absorption lines and seems to be beyond any doubt by now .",
    "very few studies have been dedicated to the contribution functions of the stokes parameters and to depths of their formation due to difficulties in calculations of the stokes profiles .",
    "the depths of formation of the stokes profiles were studied for the first time by rachkovskii @xcite , who compared the variations with depth of the emergent radiation intensities in continuum and in lines and drew the conclusion that the polarization parameters of radiation refer to higher layers than the line intensity does .",
    "the contribution functions were already used by staude @xcite to determine the depth of formation of magnetically sensitive lines , but only the contribution to line emission was considered .",
    "these studies had some drawbacks  the depths found in them were not the depths of absorption line formation , but characterized the regions of effective radiation in a given line . in order to determine the depth of line formation in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "it is necessary to obtain the depression contribution functions for the stokes parameters and to calculate the depth of formation , using these functions .",
    "the progress in studying the depths of formation of the stokes parameters began with paper @xcite by van ballegooijen , though the depths of formation were not determined directly there .",
    "the method proposed in @xcite for solving the transfer equation for polarized radiation enabled to write a single equation in a matrix form instead of four transfer equations for the stokes parameters ; in that equation , the polarized radiation was represented as the matrix    @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the stokes parameters describing the intensity and polarization characteristics of radiation .",
    "a formal solution of the transfer equation was obtained in the integral form :    @xmath10 where the integrand @xmath11 is a matrix whose elements define the contribution functions for the stokes parameters .",
    "these contribution functions are called the emission contribution functions of the stokes parameters .",
    "they describe the contribution of radiation of atmospheric layers to the polarized radiation emerging in the line , and the integral of the contribution function along height gives the value of the stokes parameters .",
    "thus , the author of @xcite succeeded in representing each of the stokes parameters as an integral of an ordinary function along height .",
    "this paper stimulated the deriving of the depression contribution functions for the stokes parameters of the fraunhofer lines .",
    "grossman - doerth et al .",
    "@xcite , using the method of @xcite and the procedure of @xcite , were the first to compose the transfer equation for the relative depression of propagating polarized radiation , this depression being represented as the matrix    @xmath12 the matrix elements in @xmath13 contain the stokes parameters of relative depression : @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; @xmath17 .",
    "a formal solution of the transfer equation for the matrix @xmath13 is the integral    @xmath18 where the integrand @xmath19 is also a matrix .",
    "the depression contribution functions ( similar to the emission ones ) for each of the stokes parameters are defined in terms of the @xmath19 matrix elements .",
    "mathematical expressions of the contribution functions for the stokes parameters can be found in @xcite .",
    "we used the depression contribution functions @xcite for the stokes parameters in our study to determine the depths of formation of the stokes profiles of magnetically active absorption lines , denoting them as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 in accordance with the stokes parameters .",
    "in a general case , a spectral line in a magnetic field splits into three groups of components .",
    "the first group is characterized by absorption of the radiation polarized linearly in the direction of the magnetic field ( the @xmath24 components ) .",
    "the second group ( the @xmath25 components ) is characterized by absorption of the radiation right - hand circularly polarized in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the field .",
    "the components of the third group ( the @xmath26 components ) are left - hand circularly polarized in the same plane . the observed relative line depression described by the stokes parameter @xmath27 which represents the absorption of both unpolarized and polarized light in a certain section of the line profile contains information on all the components .",
    "the profile of @xmath27 is to be considered as a superposition of profiles of all three component groups . in consequence of this ,",
    "the function of contribution to the relative depression @xmath20 may be of a complex character .",
    "as the contribution function @xmath20 contains contributions of all components , its shape will depend on the spacing between the groups of components and on their intensities .",
    "since the @xmath28 components remain undisplaced in the magnetic field , the spacing between the @xmath29 groups which is determined according to the splitting rule is of importance .",
    "the intensities of each group of components depend on the relative selective absorption coefficient at the line center , on the inclination of magnetic field , and on the value of anomalous dispersion .",
    "thus , the contribution function @xmath20 is determined by the effective land factor @xmath30 , magnetic field strength , wavelength , number of absorbing atoms , doppler width , damping constant , magnetic field inclination , etc .",
    "the number of parameters is so great that a detailed investigation of contribution functions is very laborious .",
    "it seems reasonable to study only characteristic properties of the contribution functions . with that end in view",
    ", we calculated the contribution functions for the stokes parameters of a line and separately for each group of components depending on the profile section @xmath31 , the inclination angle @xmath32 , and the magnetic field strength @xmath33 . while calculating contribution functions for one group of components , we assumed other functions to be equal to zero .",
    "the spectral line fe i 643.085  nm was selected for calculations . as a model of the region where the line absorption is formed , we took the empirical model of the magnetic flux tube @xcite which was obtained by comparing calculated profiles of the stokes parameters @xmath6 and an observed line profile in a plage area .",
    "the microturbulent velocity was assumed to be 1  km / s , the damping constant was 1.5@xmath34 , and the iron abundance was 7.64 dex .     [ fig1 ]",
    "analysis of the results obtained revealed a clear dependence of the contribution function profiles for the stokes parameters on the intensity of the zeeman components .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the profiles for the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the corresponding contribution functions @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath23 for the line and for its groups of components at different profile sections @xmath31 which are formed in a magnetic flux tube with a magnetic field strength of 0.1 t , an inclination of @xmath37 , and an azimuth of @xmath38 .",
    "it is evident that the contribution functions for the parameter @xmath27 are asymmetric .",
    "a second maximum is outlined in those functions @xmath20 which were calculated for a steep part of the line profile , for @xmath39  pm , for example .",
    "the contribution functions @xmath20 have a shape close to a symmetric one only for the center and for distant wings of the line .",
    "the contribution functions of parameters @xmath27 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 can take on the negative values also , as they characterize the difference in absorptions of polarized radiation for two directions .",
    "the positive and negative maxima of the @xmath21 function change places in going from the line center to the wing , which is evidence of a change in the direction of light polarization along the line profile .",
    "the positive and negative maxima of the contribution function @xmath23 characterize the predominance of contribution to the absorption of the right - hand and left - hand circularly polarized light , respectively .",
    "their contributions are equal at the line center , and so @xmath23 is equal to zero here . in going to the line wing ,",
    "the value of the @xmath23 maxima varies in accordance with the contribution of the @xmath29 components .",
    "one can see in figs 3 and 4 how the stokes profiles @xmath27 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and their contribution functions calculated for the profile sections @xmath40 , 5 , 10 pm vary when the inclination increases from 0@xmath41 to 90@xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath20 is the most asymmetric for @xmath43 and @xmath44  pm .",
    "the contribution of the undisplaced @xmath28 component grows with increasing @xmath32 .",
    "this `` smooths '' the @xmath20 contribution function , and its asymmetry diminishes .",
    "the maximum values of the @xmath21 function become the greatest at @xmath45 and @xmath46  pm .",
    "the greatest positive and negative maxima of the @xmath23 function are observed at @xmath43 , @xmath46  pm and@xmath47 , @xmath48  pm , respectively .",
    "( points ) , 5  pm ( squares ) , 10  pm ( triangles ) . ]",
    "the effect of the magnetic field strength on the shape of profiles and contribution functions for the sections @xmath49 , 5 , 10  pm is demonstrated in figs 5 and 6 . the profile shape for @xmath27 varies with increasing field strength .",
    "the @xmath20 functions for @xmath31 = 0 , 5  pm shift slightly to deeper layers of the atmosphere .",
    "their width increases , and the depression grows for @xmath50  pm with growing @xmath33 , and the values of maxima in the functions @xmath20 grow correspondingly . in the functions",
    "@xmath23 , the negative maximum diminishes with increasing @xmath33 at the same distances from the line center , as the @xmath29 group moves away from the line center , and this means that its intensity becomes less at the same @xmath31 .",
    "an increase of the field strength favours a `` clearing '' of the right - hand polarized absorption from the left - hand polarized one in the right wing of the line profile .",
    "it should be noted that the value of the land factor also affects strongly the shape of the contribution functions .",
    "the larger @xmath30 the greater is the splitting of components , and the cases are possible when the components separate entirely , i.e. , a complete splitting occurs , and then the shape of the contribution functions does not differ from a usual symmetric shape .",
    "for example , the complete splitting is observed for the line fe i 525.02  nm with @xmath51 which originates in magnetic flux tubes with a longitudinal magnetic field of a strength higher than 0.1  t.    so , variations of the contribution functions of magnetically active absorption lines under the effect of a magnetic field correspond to variations of line profiles .",
    "the contribution functions of the stokes parameter @xmath27 which refer to steep parts of wings of line profiles become asymmetric due to an increase of the distance between splitted line components .",
    "a second maximum may appear for moderately strong lines in which @xmath52 when the magnetic field is longitudinal or is close to longitudinal and its strength is higher than 0.1 t. the contribution functions for the polarization parameters @xmath35 , @xmath53 , and @xmath36 have a complex shape with a positive and a negative maxima .",
    "the mean depth of the layer where the processes of selective absorption in a given frequency interval of a spectral line go effectively is called the depth of formation of the absorption line profile section , and it is calculated as a center of gravity or as a weighted mean value :    @xmath54 the depression contribution function is used for the weight function @xmath55 .",
    "the averaging operation is quite justifiable here ; this follows from @xcite , for example , where it is shown that , if a contribution function positive over the whole height interval is normalized , then the new function    @xmath56 thus obtained may be considered as the height distribution of probability density for the given process in the atmosphere .",
    "having calculated the center and variance of the distribution , one can use this function for finding not only the depth but the width also of the layer where a significant contribution occurs .",
    "the analysis of the contribution functions for the stokes parameters made by us has shown that the contribution function for the parameter @xmath27 can be transformed to the probability density function .",
    "the depression function @xmath57 is positive and it is easily normalized by dividing it by the value of relative depression @xmath58 . as a result , we obtain the function    @xmath59 where    @xmath60 this function characterizes the probability of absorption of the unpolarized and polarized radiation in a given line in a given spectral interval @xmath61",
    ". the depth of formation @xmath62 and the half - width of the effective layer @xmath62 can be calculated now for the parameter @xmath27 by the following expressions :    @xmath63    @xmath64 besides that , the so - called averaged depth of formation of the complete line profile can be calculated as a weighted mean quantity :    @xmath65 where    @xmath66 the relative depression , i.e. , the function @xmath67 is a weight function here ; @xmath68 is the total line depression , or the equivalent width . calculating the quantities @xmath69 and @xmath70 by the expressions given here ,",
    "we define completely the region of formation of the stokes profile @xmath27 and in that way solve the problem of the depth of formation of a magnetically active absorption line in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the formulae given above can not be used in this case , since the contribution functions for the stokes parameters @xmath35 , @xmath53 , and @xmath36 can take on both positive and negative values in the height range considered here . in order to find the mean depth of formation of a polarization parameter , it is more convenient to resort to the center of gravity of the plane figure formed by the curve corresponding to the contribution function and by abscissa .",
    "for example , let us consider the contribution function @xmath23 for the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "the area of the figure @xmath71 is equal to the sum of two areas formed by the positive and negative parts of the @xmath23 curve which lie above and below the abscissa , i.e.,@xmath72 , where    @xmath73 @xmath74 is the geometric height at which the function @xmath23 changes its sign .",
    "we shall use the expression    @xmath75 to determine the depth of formation of the @xmath36 profile . substituting the expression for @xmath71 and transforming to a form convenient for calculations ,",
    "we get    @xmath76 the depths of formation for the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath53 can be found in the same way .",
    "thus , to calculate the depths of profile formation for polarization characteristics of magnetically active lines , one can use the formula of weighted mean where the modulus of the depression contribution function of the stokes parameters is used for the weight function .",
    "using three lines fe i 525.02 , 523.29 , 643.08  nm as an example ( fig",
    ".  7 ) , we illustrated the variations in the depth of formation of the stokes parameters with varying magnetic field strength .",
    "we calculated the profiles and the depths of their formation , varying the magnetic field strength @xmath33 from 0 to 0.2 t. figure 8 shows the effect of the field inclination on the depth of formation of the stokes profiles for the line fe i 643.08  nm .",
    "when the inclination varies , the azimuth remains equal to zero , and the field strength is 0.1 t. when calculating the depths of formation of the stokes profiles , we adopted the magnetic flux tube model of @xcite and used the geometric scale height @xmath77 and the logarithmic optical depth scale log @xmath78 , as these scales are mostly used in practice .",
    "the depths of formation in the figures are given in the geometric scale height .",
    "the geometric height zero level @xmath79 corresponds to the optical depth @xmath80 .",
    "geometric heights below the zero level take on negative values and above it they are positive .",
    "analysis of the results brings us to the following conclusions .",
    "as is generally known , the fraunhofer line profiles change their shape in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it differs from the classic profile shape of a fraunhofer line ( see fig .  7 ) .",
    "the depression in the central part of the profile decreases with increasing field strength as compared to the profile calculated without a magnetic field ( a `` nonmagnetic '' profile ) , and in the line wings it increases .",
    "the greater the land factor the stronger this effect is . the profiles and the depth of formation of the depression change .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "7 that , as the magnetic field strength and the land factor are growing , the central part of the profile is formed in more deep layers ( the geometric heights decrease ) , the middle part is formed in more high layers ( the geometric heights increase ) as compared to the `` nonmagnetic '' profile , and far wings are formed in the layers where the far wings of `` nonmagnetic '' profiles are formed .",
    "the depth of line formation averaged over the entire profile depends on the manner in which the equivalent width varies .",
    "the greater the magnetic broadening of the line the higher in the atmosphere the entire line profile is formed on the average , i.e. , the magnetic field as if `` forces out '' slightly the line upwards",
    ". a noticeable growth of the height may be expected for the lines with @xmath81 and @xmath82  pm for @xmath83  t. but calculations show that this growth is several kilometers only .",
    "when magnetic fields are measured from the fraunhofer lines , it should be remembered that a steep section of the magnetic line profile can form higher in the atmosphere than the profile center .",
    "changes in the magnetic field inclination from @xmath38 to @xmath84 affect little both the profile @xmath27 ( fig .  3 ) and",
    "the depths of its formation ( fig .  8) .",
    "appreciable changes are observed only at the distances corresponding to the profile half - widths , where the geometric height of formation decreases with increasing inclination .",
    "the width of the layer where the main fraction of polarized radiation is absorbed in a certain part of line depends on the value of the line splitting in the magnetic field , @xmath85 .",
    "when the splitting grows , the layer width also grows .",
    "the complete splitting having been reached , the layer width diminishes .",
    "the width is different for different parts of the line .",
    "the layer width reaches its maximum value , as a rule , for the middle part of the profile wings .",
    "the layer width decreases when the magnetic field inclination varies from @xmath38 to @xmath84 .",
    "changes of the layer width that occur under the effect of a magnetic field are as large as tens of kilometers .",
    "for example , for a region @xmath86  pm in the line fe i 643.08  nm which is formed in a magnetic flux tube with a field strength of 0 , 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.3 t and @xmath87 , @xmath88 , the maximum half - width of the effective layer reaches 90 , 123 , 126 , 119 , 105  km , respectively . the maximum half - width for inclinations of @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath89 , @xmath84 and @xmath90 t is 123 , 116 , 100 , 92  km , respectively .",
    "if the magnetic field is longitudinal , only one polarization parameter @xmath36 exists . the depth of its formation is found to be close to the depth of formation of the @xmath27 profile ( fig .",
    "the difference between them reaches several kilometers , @xmath36 being formed slightly higher than @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the depths of formation of the stokes profiles @xmath27 and @xmath36 for a region @xmath46  pm of the lines fe i 525.02 , 523.29 , 643.08  nm in a magnetic flux tube with @xmath91  t , @xmath92 , @xmath93 are 187 and 188 , 186 and 201 , 262 and 267  km , respectively .",
    "if the magnetic field inclination @xmath32 varies from @xmath38 to @xmath84 at @xmath93 , the parameter @xmath35 appears in addition to @xmath36 , and its profile is formed higher that @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "for example , for @xmath48 pm of the line 643.08  nm in a magnetic flux tube with @xmath90 t , @xmath94 , @xmath93 , the @xmath27 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 profiles are formed at depths of 253 , 258 , 256  km , respectively .",
    "if we change the angle @xmath95 , the parameter @xmath53 will appear .",
    "figure 9 shows how the depths of formation of @xmath35 and @xmath53 change in these cases .",
    "it follows from the results of calculations that the polarization profiles @xmath35 , @xmath53 , and @xmath36 are formed higher than the general relative depression of the line , @xmath96 , but the difference is insignificant on the average .",
    "therefore , it may be assumed that all the stokes profiles are formed in the same layers .",
    "for calculating the depths of line formation , first of all it is necessary to define physical conditions in the region of formation or to specify a model solar atmosphere .",
    "it is well known that even the simplest horizontally homogeneous model atmosphere is defined by a large number of parameters which vary with height .",
    "the accuracy of calculations depends therefore completely on the accuracy of simulation of the conditions in the atmospheric regions where the processes of absorption line formation go .",
    "the calculated depth of line formation refers directly to the specific model used in the calculations .",
    "variations of physical conditions in the atmosphere cause variations of such line parameters as the central intensity , equivalent width , profile shape , and the depth of formation as well .",
    "such a notion as the depth of line formation appears to become more indeterminate and becomes meaningless in inhomogeneous model atmospheres . in this case ,",
    "it is better to use the concept of the effective region of formation .    [",
    "cols=\"^,<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     to demonstrate the aforesaid , we chose three substantially different models .",
    "they are the models of the quiet photosphere ( holmu @xcite ) , a plage area ( wal2 @xcite ) , and a spot ( obst @xcite ) .",
    "table 1 gives the parameters of the lines used .",
    "the chemical element abundances were taken according to @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is longitudinal with a strength of 0.15 t and the azimuth @xmath93 .",
    "the microturbulent velocity is 1  km / s ( macroturbulence was ignored ) , the damping constant is @xmath97 .",
    "tables 25 give the results of calculations for the depths of formation of selected lines for each of the models .",
    "table 2 contains the calculation data for the quiet photosphere without regard to a magnetic field .",
    "the values of the following parameters are given for each line : equivalent width @xmath68 averaged over the entire line profile , depth of formation @xmath70 , optical depth @xmath98 , selected section on the profile @xmath31 , relative line depression @xmath99 , parameters @xmath27 and @xmath36 , depth of formation and half - width of the effective layer of the depression @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "in order to demonstrate variations in the depth of formation over a profile from one model to another , we selected three sections on the profile calculated for the holmu model without a magnetic field : at the line center , at a distance corresponding to the line half - width , and in a wing , where the depression was 1% . further , the depths of formation were calculated in other models for the same sections @xmath31 .",
    "an additional point on the profile was calculated in that part of the wing where it became wider .",
    "the data given in the tables demonstrate clearly the reaction of lines to the conditions of their formation . as an example",
    ", we may point at the lines whose equivalent width more than doubled upon the temperature rise .",
    "these are the lines v i 611.16  nm , ti i 612.62  nm , ni i 612.89  nm , fei 524.75 , 525.02 , 615.16 , 617.33 , 630.25  nm .",
    "the lines fe ii 523.46 and 636.94  nm react weakly to the temperature rise , but they practically disappear when the temperature drops , in a spot , for example .",
