    "here we attempt to take advantage of the infrared fluctuations to study the disk structure in more detail . by searching for correlations between the infrared variability and other forms of variability ( x - ray , accretion , etc . ) we can directly study the influence of various factors that may set the structure of the dusty disk .",
    "recent observations have found that the occurrence rate of infrared variability increases with x - ray luminosity @xcite , suggestive of some sort of connection between the two .",

    "since the fields of view of the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] arrays do not completely overlap , our final map covered by both bands was not a square and instead had a total area of roughly 0.4@xmath2 by 0.25@xmath2 .",

    "as a nearby ( @xmath0320 pc ) , young ( 2 - 3 myr ) , relatively compact cluster ic 348 has proven to be a valuable laboratory for studying young stellar object variability @xcite . with over 300 cluster members , only one of which is earlier than a0 , this region of low mass star formation contains a wide variety of circumstellar structures from pre - natal envelopes to disks with many - au wide gaps @xcite . in the infrared , almost 60%  of the sources with an infrared excess are variable at [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] @xcite , while 89%  of the pre - main sequence stars brighter than i=14 are variable in the optical @xcite on timescales of weeks to months .",
    "the frequency of these fluctuations indicates that the majority of pre - main sequence stars experience variability on their stellar surface , probed by the optical data , and within an au of the star , probed by the infrared data .    in our search for correlated x - ray and infrared variability",

    "cluster members , and their stellar properties ( l@xmath3,t@xmath4 , etc . ) , are drawn from @xcite as compiled by @xcite .",
    "there are a total of 133 cluster members detected on more than one x - ray epoch , with 107 detected on more than four epochs .",
    "we restrict ourselves to these 107 stars because they have enough epochs for studying variability .",
    "while we include x - ray fluxes from previous studies of ic 348 @xcite , our analysis focuses on the data that are contemporaneous with the infrared data . as a sub - sample of the cluster ,",

    "x - ray emission is known to be brighter among sources without active accretion @xcite and in our sample this will present itself as a detection efficiency that is a function of the infrared sed slope ( defined as the logarithmic slope of @xmath7 versus @xmath8 over the 3 - 8  range ) since the presence of a circumstellar disk as measured with the infrared excess is correlated with accretion . using the dereddened flux , the sed slope varies from @xmath9 for sources without a disk to @xmath10 for sources with an envelope and we use @xmath11 as the boundary between a source with or without a circumstellar disk .",
    "@xcite find that within ic 348 the median x - ray luminosity among stars with disks is @xmath00.3 dex lower than comparable stars without disks .",
    "figure  [ demographics ] shows the distribution of sed slope for x - ray detections compared with the entire sample , demonstrating our inefficient sensitivity to sources with disks .",
    "for the majority of our analysis we restrict ourselves to the sources with a disk .",
    "the presence of infrared variability is assessed using the techniques described in @xcite . in short ,",
    "we use the reduced chi - square statistic for each band , and well as the stetson index s , which is sensitive to correlated variability in the two irac bands .",
    "the use of the stetson index does require us to restrict the analysis to sources detected in both bands , but the added sensitivity of this index compared to the reduced chi - square offsets the reduction in sample size .",
    "a star is marked as an infrared variable if @xmath12)>3 $ ] or @xmath13)>3 $ ] or s@xmath140.45 .",
    "based on prior analysis , we are sensitive to @xmath15 of fluctuations down to 0.04 mag for sources brighter than 14th magnitude @xcite ; this sensitivity limit is relatively independent of source brightness because most of the uncertainty is due to systematic effects for these bright targets @xcite . while spitzer monitoring data is available from multiple observing campaigns , we focus on the contemporaneous fall 2011 data when assessing variability since we are mainly concerned with the behavior during the same time frame as any x - ray fluctuations .",
    "the vast majority of stars variable in one season are also variable in other seasons , and our results would not significantly change if we included the entire dataset . since the 3 - 5@xmath16 emission probed by this photometry is dominated by the inner edge of the dusty disk @xcite , we are not sensitive to the dynamics of the regions of the disk beyond this point .    given that we are mainly concerned with the change in x - ray flux , rather than its overall level , we do not convert photon fluxes to luminosities , which requires assumptions about the distance to the cluster and the underlying x - ray spectrum .",
    "while the arrival time of each photon is recorded , we instead use the photon flux averaged over each 10ks observing run , with each epoch comprising one point on our light curve .",
    "we chose to do this to increase sensitivity at the expense of knowledge about the x - ray variability on very short timescales .",
    "we restrict ourselves to sources detected on at least four x - ray epochs .",
    "photon fluxes range from 1e-6 to 1e-4 photons / s/@xmath17 , or 1 to 1200 net photons per 10ks block .",
    "we can roughly estimate the x - ray luminosities by assuming an average photon energy of 1.5kev , to convert from photon flux to energy flux , and a distance of 320pc ; we find luminosities range from @xmath010@xmath18 to @xmath010@xmath19 erg / sec with a typical luminosity of @xmath010@xmath20erg / sec similar to previous studies @xcite .",
    "our final sample consists of 39 stars ( table  [ var_table ] ) with circumstellar disks with sufficient x - ray photometry to examine variability , all of which were detected in the infrared .",
    "figure  [ lc_examples ] show examples of light curves for stars with and without x - ray and infrared variability to demonstrate the fidelity of our data .",
    "our sensitivity to infrared variability is fairly uniform over our entire sample because the uncertainties are dominated by systematics for the vast majority of sources .",
    "this is not the case for the x - ray emission whose uncertainties are dominated by poisson statistics and scale with the square root of the flux .",
    "this leads to substantially nonuniform sensitivities throughout our sample . as with the infrared flux we use the reduced chi - square to select variable x - ray emission , using @xmath21 as the boundary between variables and non - variables",
    "this picks out variations that are significant relative to the noise , which varies substantially between the brightest and the faintest sources . as a result",
    ", the size of the fluctuations selected as variable will strongly depend on the mean x - ray flux . on average",
    "this @xmath22 boundary corresponds to a factor of 2 increase in the flux relative to the mean with fluctuations reaching close to a factor of 10 . despite the non - continuous nature of our observations and",
    "the use of different selection criteria for selecting variables as compared to these previous studies , we pick out stars with similar fluctuations .",
    "@xcite find that among stars with disks , on timescales of a week , fluctuations are typically a factor of 3 , similar to our results .",
    "overall our sample consists of 39 sources with ( 1 ) detections on four or more x - ray epochs , ( 2 ) detections in both irac bands on all epochs , ( 3 ) an infrared excess indicative of a disk . among these 39 stars ,",
    "31 have significant fluctuations in the infrared , while 28 have detectable x - ray variability .",
    "our observing cadence was designed to probe long term effects of x - ray fluctuations on disk emission , at the expense of knowledge about any short , instantaneous changes in disk emission .",
    "while very rapid changes in infrared emission have been observed @xcite , week to month long variations make up a substantial fraction of the infrared variability @xcite .",
    "the time between an x - ray epoch and the nearest infrared observation ranges from 0.1 to 2.1 days ( 12 - 180 ks ) and we are completely insensitive to changes in infrared emission on timescale shorter than this .",
    "we instead focus on responses that cover more than 2 infrared epochs ( @xmath14300ks = 4 days ) .",
    "this caveat should be kept in mind when interpreting our results , especially as they apply to physical connections between x - ray and infrared variability .",
    "we first look at the 28 stars with disks that are variable in both the x - ray and infrared to see if the light curves themselves are correlated .",
    "this is assessed using the kendall s tau and spearman s rho statistics .",
    "both of these coefficients serve as non - parametric tests of whether increases or decreases in the x - ray are mirrored in infrared .",
    "we find no significant correlation between the x - ray and infrared light curves suggesting that there is no strong correlation between the infrared and x - ray variability .",
    "we also find that the size of the infrared fluctuations is not correlated with the size of the x - ray fluctuations among these variable stars .",
    "@xcite find correlated variations in optical flux and soft , but not hard , x - ray flux of ctts in ngc 2264 between observations separated by two weeks , suggesting that there is a difference between the behavior of the soft and hard x - ray emission .",
    "we examine how the median x - ray photon energy changes over the course of the light curve to see if it changes in concert with the infrared emission .",
    "if the soft x - ray emission tracks the infrared emission while the hard x - ray flux is constant , then the median photon energy will decrease as the infrared emission increases .",
    "given that we typically only detect 24 photons per source per 10ks block we use the median flux instead of just the soft x - ray photons to reduce the errors and maximize our sensitivity to fluctuations .",
    "using both the kendall s tau and spearman s rho metrics , we do not find a correlation between the median photon energy and the infrared flux in any of our disk - bearing targets .",
    "we also find no significant correlation in the size of the infrared variability and the size of the variability in median photon energy .",
    "among the two brightest x - ray sources , lrll 2 and 6 , for which we measure @xmath0400 photons per 10 ks , while there is some evidence for a change in median photon energy this change does not track with the infrared emission .",
    "the kendall s tau and spearman s rho statistics are effective at selecting correlated variations when there is no time - delay between the infrared and x - ray fluctuations and if the light curve is monotonic .",
    "@xcite find that roughly a tenth of the stars in orion with known optical periods have detectable x - ray periods and any corresponding , but phase shifted , variability in the infrared would be missed by the previous metrics . to account for a time delay between the two light curves we employ the cross - correlation function , defined as : @xmath23[y(t_i-\\tau)-\\bar{y}]}{\\sigma_x\\sigma_y}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the x - ray and infrared light curves , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the respective means and standard deviations of the two light curves and",
    "@xmath30 is the time lag between the two light curves @xcite .",
    "this effectively shifts the infrared light curves by @xmath30 days and calculates how well the two light curves match after this shift .",
    "a positive value of @xmath30 implies that the ir light curve leads the x - ray light curve , while a negative lag corresponds to the x - ray light curve leading the ir light curve .",
    "such an effect might be expected if there is an appreciable time delay between the occurrence of an x - ray fluctuation and the response of the disk or if the x - ray and infrared flux show a rotational modulation that is out of phase .",
    "given that the data are not continuously sampled , we interpolate the more heavily sampled infrared light curve onto the x - ray light curve in our analysis . we assess the uncertainty in the ccf at different lags by computing the ccf of a particular x - ray light curve with infrared light curves from 100 random cluster members , and use the dispersion in the value of the ccf at each lag as its uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ ccf ] shows our results for lrl 5 and 58 as examples .",
    "when examining all 28 cluster members with variability in both the x - ray and infrared , we find no evidence of a strong cross - correlation signal between a lag of -20 and 20 days , with our strongest sensitivity to lags between -10 and 10 days .",
    "again there is no strong evidence for a direct connection between the infrared and x - ray variability .",
    "the ccf , while effective at picking out light curves with a time lag , breaks down in the presence of flares .",
    "@xcite find that roughly a quarter of stars within taurus exhibit flares , with these flaring sources making up half of the variable sample . while these outlier points within a light curve can easily disrupt any underlying correlation , they could also be a source of changes in infrared emission if the flare is powerful enough .",
    "we define a source as having a flare if it is variable in the x - ray ( @xmath31 ) and it has one epoch whose flux is greater than three times larger than the median flux .",
    "we can also look for x - ray flares within a single 10 ks epoch among the brightest sources since each photon is tracked when taking x - ray observation .",
    "only one source ( lrll 36 ) shows evidence for an x - ray flare during one of these epochs , and this star has been included in our analysis .",
    "there are a total of 13 cluster members with an x - ray flare , all but one of which is variable in the infrared . in none of these stars",
    "do we see strong evidence for an extended change in the ir flux following the x - ray flare .",
    "figure  [ flare ] shows the x - ray and infrared light curves of one star with an x - ray flare demonstrating the lack of response in the infrared light curve .",
    "if the infrared flux is changing before the flare , it continues along its course after the flare .",
    "we examine in detail the change in ir flux associated with an x - ray flare by calculating the change in [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] magnitude between the two epochs ( i.e. about 2 days ) surrounding the x - ray flare and comparing this to all consecutive epoch magnitude changes in the infrared light curve .",
    "figure  [ flare ] shows an example of this analysis .",
    "this allows us to quantify the infrared fluctuation closest to the x - ray flare and how it compares to the fluctuations seen at other times . in none of the light curves",
    "do we see evidence that the ir fluctuation near the x - ray flare is substantially different than what is seen in any other part of the light curve .",
    "this is consistent with our visual inspection which found no evidence for a change in infrared flux in response to an x - ray flare .",
    "again we note that given our observing cadence we are severely limited in assessing the immediate response of the infrared flux to an x - ray flare .",
    "the time between an x - ray epoch and an infrared epoch ranges from 0.1 to 2.1 days ( 12 - 180ks ) .",
    "the majority of x - ray flares have decay times less than 60ks with an average decay time of 10ks @xcite and almost all x - ray flares would have decayed away by the time the system was observed in the infrared .",
    "ysos typically exhibit one flare per star per 500ks with the time between bright flares ( l@xmath32erg / sec ) a factor of a few longer than this @xcite .",
    "@xcite find similar results for solar - type stars , with roughly one flare per star per 650ks . a theory for the week to month long infrared variability that relies solely on x - ray flares would require the infrared response to last at least @xmath0500ks(=5.8days ) to extend the infrared variability throughout the quiescent period between flares .",
    "even with our limited cadence we can exclude these types of large , long infrared responses .",
    "we find no direct connection between x - ray fluctuations and infrared variability . there is no clear correlation between the shapes of the infrared and x - ray light curves and",
    "there are no large , long - term changes in infrared emission following x - ray flares .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of correlated x - ray / infrared variability seen in the coronet cluster @xcite .",
    "given the cadence of our observations we can not comment on short ( less than a few days ) , immediate responses of the disk to the changing x - ray flux ; we can only constrain the type of interactions that lead to sustained week - long fluctuations .",
    "this caveat should be kept in mind in the context of the different physical situations that we discuss below .    interpreting this result",
    "depends on how x - ray variability could be physically connected to changes in disk structure .",
    "our [ 3.6],[4.5 ] infrared observations are dominated by emission from the inner edge of the disk , which is made up of a slightly rounded wall of dust a few tenths of an au from the star at the boundary where the dust becomes hot enough to sublimate @xcite .",
    "there are three main possibilities connecting x - ray variability to changes in the structure of this wall , which we will consider in turn : ( 1 ) heating of dust by x - ray photons , ( 2 ) ionization of dust by x - ray photons , ( 3 ) interactions between the circumstellar disk and the hot plasma created during the flare    _ x - ray heating : _ a rapid increase in the stellar flux illuminating the disk would lead to an almost instantaneous change in the temperature of the disk surface layers @xcite , causing the infrared emission to increase .",
    "our observations show no evidence for a long - term change in infrared emission in response to changes in x - ray flux , suggesting that heating by x - rays is not an important factor in setting the dust temperature .",
    "this is not surprising since models predict that much of the x - ray flux will be absorbed by gas in the tenuous upper layers of the disk @xcite and dust emission models are generally able to reproduce circumstellar disk emission in a wide range of stars without including illumination from stellar x - rays @xcite . in ic 348 the ratio of x - ray luminosity to bolometric luminosity ranges from 10@xmath33 @xcite again suggesting that x - ray heating does not contribute significantly to the dust temperature .",
    "_ x - ray ionization _ as with heating , an increase in x - ray flux may increase the ionization fraction of the dust through the increased collisions with electrons and ions @xcite , leading to observable dynamical effects due to interactions between this ionized material and the magnetic field .",
    "even if x - ray heating is minimal , the increased depth at which x - ray ionization can penetrate the disk @xcite leaves open another avenue for x - ray photons to change the dust structure .",
    "@xcite provide detailed models of such a scenario and find that a large flare ( l@xmath34erg / s ) that lasts for a day ( = 86ks ) can substantially change the height of the inner disk .",
    "this effect was predicted to decay over the course of a week , leading to extended perturbations to the infrared emission .",
    "@xcite find that eight out of 32 flares have l@xmath32erg / s while @xcite find similar numbers for the occurrence of large flares . in our sample",
    "we find no strong evidence for an extended response to an x - ray although we do not observe any flares as large as employed in these models and can not comment on any immediate response to such outbursts .",
    "_ high temperature plasma _ x - ray flares are associated with magnetic reconnection events injecting magnetic energy into the upper reaches of the stellar atmosphere @xcite .",

    "find that 9 out of 22 flares reach larger than 5r@xmath3 and could potentially interact with the disk in systems with very close in dust .",
    "@xcite model a different type of flare that originates at the interface between the disk and the stellar magnetic field that provides a direct interaction between the flare and the disk structure . in this model the disk height can change by a factor of two in response to a l@xmath35erg / s sized flare .",
    "we see no evidence for long - term reactions to x - ray flares suggesting that these types of interactions do not drive the majority of the observed infrared variability .",
    "as with the disked sources , in the diskless stars we see no evidence for a correlation between the x - ray and infrared variability . without excess emission ,",
    "the infrared flux in the diskless stars is tracing the stellar flux rather than the dust in the inner disk .",
    "stellar variability in diskless stars is dominated by the rotation of star spots , which may be located at sites of amplified magnetic field strength .",
    "we see no response in the infrared light curve following x - ray flares , similar to the systems with protoplanetary disks .",
    "analysis with the cross - correlation function as well as kendall s tau and spearman s rho statistics , confirms the lack of similarity in light curve shapes .",
    "compared to stars with disks , diskless stars show weaker fluctuations in the infrared @xcite and in the x - ray @xcite .",
    "previous studies have found that while x - ray and optical periods are sometimes similar @xcite there is often not a direct correlation between the x - ray and optical fluctuations @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude that even though x - ray production is connected to the presence of a magnetically active , spotted surface , as evidenced by the connection between optical variability and x - ray luminosity , the regions of x - ray production and the star spots are not spatially coincident .",
    "we find no evidence for an increased frequency of infrared variability among stars with x - ray variability .",
    "we see no correlation in the shape of the light curves in stars that exhibit variability in both bands , which is especially true in the stars with moderate x - ray flares for which we see no evidence for a change in infrared flux in response to the flare .",
    "we put limits on the relation between x - ray variability and the week to month long infrared variability of dust at the inner edge of the disk that is common among young stellar objects .    based on the observational evidence , the influence of x - ray heating on the temperature of the dust close to the star is relatively minor , which in turn has implications for the overall structure of the inner edge of the disk .",
    "below z / r@xmath00.1 the densities are high enough that the gas and dust temperature are highly coupled through collisions @xcite , allowing the dust temperature to set the gas temperature .",
    "the gas temperature in turn sets the pressure scale height of the disk , which is the basis of the vertical structure of the disk in a region where planet formation is expected to occur .",
    "if the x - rays can not influence the dust thermal structure , then they will not influence the overall structure in this area of the disk .",
    "compared to fuv and euv photons , x - rays have a higher penetration depth because the opacity of the gas decreases towards higher energies and if x - ray photons can not reach the dusty layers , then fuv and euv photons contribute even less to the dust temperature .",
    "the dust temperature is instead set by a combination of viscous dissipation and irradiation by stellar optical emission @xcite , at least until the disk is significantly depleted @xcite . beyond @xmath01",
    "au , which is not probed by our infrared photometry , the x - rays may still have a strong influence on disk structure through e.g. mri turbulence @xcite .    in terms of constraining the origin of the long - term infrared fluctuations , we can rule out the influence of x - ray ionization as well as interactions between the x - ray emitting plasma and the dust at the sublimation front close to the star from explaining the majority of the observed infrared variability .",
    "these factors may come into play on short timescales for a small handful of stars , or at levels below our detection limits , but generally they are not important in setting disk structure .",
    "more likely possibilities include perturbations related to accretion heating @xcite , mri driven turbulence lifting dust out of the midplane @xcite or perturbations from a companion @xcite with observations pointing toward accretion bursts , variable obscuration of the central star and changes in the inner disk structure @xcite .",

    "<S> we obtained ten epochs of chandra acis photometry over a period of 30 days with a roughly 3 day cadence contemporaneous with 20 epochs of spitzer [ 3.6],[4.5 ] photometry over 40 days with a roughly 2 day cadence of the ic 348 cluster . </S>",

    "<S> there is no significant correlation between the shape of the infrared and x - ray light curves , or between the size of the x - ray and infrared variability . among the stars with an x - ray flare none showed evidence of a correlated change in the infrared photometry on timescales of days to weeks following the flare . </S>",
