    "interestingly , this range corresponds to the measured time - scale for @xmath74 of milliseconds @xcite , and supports the suggestion that bacteria improve their performance in lli conditions by enhancing quinone - quinol charge carrier dynamics as opposed to manipulating exciton transfer . a recent proposal @xcite",
    "has shown numerically that the formation of lh2 para - crystalline domains produces a clustering trend of lh1 complexes with enhanced quinone availability  a fact that would reduce the rc cycling time .",

    "[ fig23.2](a ) shows the difference between a given membrane s efficiency @xmath73 , and the mean of all the membranes @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88 . the more clustered the rcs , the lower the efficiency in the short @xmath74 domain . as rc cycling",
    "is increased , ( b ) becomes the least efficient while all other configurations perform almost equally .",

    "the effect of the arrangement itself is lost due to slower rc dynamics , and the figure of merit that determines efficiency is the number of open rcs , which is lower for ( b ) .    to summarize so far , we find that the arrangement of complexes changes slightly the efficiency of the membranes when no rc dynamics is included  but with rc dynamics , the most important feature is the number of open rcs which is smaller for ( b ) .",

    "although the longer rc closing times make membranes more prone to dissipation and decreased efficiency , it also makes the architecture less relevant for the overall dynamics . _",

    "_ the inner rcs in clusters are able to accept excitations as cycling times increase , and hence the rcs overall are used more evenly .",

    "within a typical fluorescence lifetime of 1 ns , a single excitation has travelled hundreds of sites and explored the available rcs globally . the actual arrangement or architecture of the complexes",
    "seems not to influence the excitation s fate , since the light intensity and rc cycling determine the number of open rcs and the availability for p oxidation .",
    "this implies that the full numerical analysis of the excitation kinetics , while technically more accurate , may represent excessive computational effort  either due to the size of the state space within the master equation approach , or the number of runs required for ensemble averages with the stochastic method .",
