    "clusters of galaxies are the most massive objects in the universe .",
    "it is generally believed that dark matter constitutes a large fraction of the mass in the universe , and galaxies and clusters form in dark matter - dominated halos ( dark halos ) . in the standard picture of hierarchical structure formation of the universe ,",
    "small objects are the first to form and these then amalgamate into progressively larger system @xcite .",
    "this means that a dark halo containing a galaxy cluster has formed via merging and accretion of smaller dark halos containing galaxies or galaxy groups ( small galaxy clusters ) . from now on",
    ", we do not discriminate a dark halo containing a cluster from the cluster unless otherwise mentioned ; the same rule is applied for a group and a galaxy .    the mass distribution function ( mdf ) of galaxies absorbed into but not disrupted in a cluster is defined by the number of the galaxies in a given mass range and shows the population composition of the galaxies with different masses .",
    "the mdf tells us the average time when the galaxies stopped growing as follows .",
    "the mass of galaxies increases with time as matter accretes to them through gravity . as a result",
    ", the number of massive galaxies increases and the mdf evolves .",
    "however , as the potential well of the host cluster ( or its progenitors ) deepens as the cluster grows up , the released gravitational energy of the cluster allows the galaxies to move fast in the cluster .",
    "the large velocity of the galaxies prevents them from gathering more matter and the galaxies can not grow anymore .",
    "thus , the mdf freezes after that .",
    "the mdfs observed at present should depend on the time of the freeze . on the other hand , the integrated mdf or the galaxy population in a cluster depends on the host cluster mass ; the more massive a host cluster is , the more massive galaxies are contained in it .",
    "we have devised an analytical model to calculate the mdfs of galaxies in clusters @xcite . in the field of cosmological study ,",
    "the press - schechter ( ps ) model has been used to obtain an average mdf of objects ( galaxies and clusters of galaxies ) in the universe @xcite .",
    "the ps model treats the evolution of initial density fluctuations of the universe and predicts the number of collapsed objects in a give mass range .",
    "however , this model can not be used to obtain the mdfs of galaxies in clusters , because it does not take account of two important effects unique to clusters .",
    "one is that even before a cluster forms , the precluster region should have a higher density than the average of the universe .",
    "the other is the spatial correlation of initial density fluctuations of the universe .",
    "the correlation is important when the fluctuations are close to each other ; a precluster region is an example of the crowded fluctuations .",
    "the former effect has already been involved in the so - called extended press - schechter model ( eps ) @xcite .",
    "the model used here is a further extension of the eps model by taking account of the latter effect ( the spatial correlation ) , so we refer to this model as the sps model .",
    "the details of the sps model are described in @xcite .",
    "in principal , we can calculate mdfs using the sps model and compare them with the observed ones to estimate redshifts when the observed mdfs almost froze ( that is , the formation redshifts of galaxies ; @xmath2 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath2 is the _ average _ redshift when the growth of galaxies are held by external force ( that is , the growth of the host cluster ) . at @xmath3 the host cluster",
    "had not necessarily been unified , and the host cluster might be divided into several progenitors .",
    "we can say that the redshift @xmath2 corresponds to the time when the _ average _ mass of those progenitors became large enough to hold the growth of most of the galaxies that are included in the host cluster at @xmath4 .",
    "because it is not easy to measure galaxy masses directly by a method like gravitational lensing , it would be difficult to derive mdfs of galaxies in clusters observationally .",
    "thus , we convert the mdfs derived using the sps model to velocity distribution functions ( vdfs ) of galaxies by an empirical relation between the internal velocity and mass of galaxies obtained by numerical simulations in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the time dependence as equation ( [ eq : vint]).](fig .  13 in @xcite ) :",
    "@xmath5\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the mass of the galaxy and @xmath7 is the hubble constant represented by @xmath8 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : vint ] ) can also be applied to clusters .",
    "we compare the vdfs with the observed ones . here , ` internal velocity ' means rotation velocity ( late type galaxies ) or dispersion velocity ( early type galaxies ) .",
    "more massive galaxies have larger internal velocities .",
    "moreover , there is a benefit to use vdfs instead of mdfs .",
    "the tidal interaction among galaxies in a cluster and that between a galaxy and the host cluster somewhat affect the mdfs and vdfs after their evolutions froze @xcite .",
    "this makes it difficult to estimate the time of the freeze from the mdfs or vdfs because the sps model does not treat the interactions .",
    "however , recent ultra - high resolution n - body simulations showed that the vdfs are much less affected by the tidal interactions than the mdfs @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed that the vdfs derived using the sps model are consistent with those derived by several simulations @xcite .    to compare the theoretical model with observations",
    ", we use the catalogues of early ( e+s0 ) and late ( sp ) type galaxies in seven nearby clusters @xcite .",
    "the clusters are a1367 , coma ( a1656 ) , a2634 , a262 , pegasus and cancer clusters and the ngc  507 group , although we do not discuss the cancer cluster because the number of galaxies is too small ( less than 10 within the cluster virial radius ) .",
    "we do not discriminate the ngc  383 group from the ngc  507 group because they are very close to each other .",
    "cluster membership criteria are described in section  8 of @xcite . in the sps model",
    ", we fix the masses of the clusters at those obtained from x - ray observations if available @xcite .",
    "the x - ray mass estimation does not suffer from the small number of galaxies especially for small clusters .",
    "reiprich and b \" ohringer ( 2002 ) assumed that the average density of a cluster is 200 times the critical density of the universe .",
    "this is appropriate for the einstein de - sitter universe but not for the low density universe we adopted ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the average density of a cluster is 100 times the critical density of the universe , and the cluster masses in reiprich and b \" ohringer ( 2002 ) are modified to be consistent with the assumption . on the modification , we assume that the dark matter distribution in clusters is approximated by a power law distribution with an index of @xmath13 @xcite . for the pegasus cluster ,",
    "since the mass is not obtained by x - ray observations , we estimate it by a relation between the velocity dispersion of galaxies in a cluster and the mass of the cluster ; we assume that the relation is also given by equation ( [ eq : vint ] ) for @xmath14 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the pegasus cluster is @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the resultant cluster masses ( @xmath16 ) and viral radii ( @xmath17 ) are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "note that these mass estimations assume that clusters and groups have collapsed and virialized . on the other hand ,",
    "we leave the average redshift when galaxies stopped growing in mass ( @xmath2 ) to be a free parameter in the sps model . in order to deal with the observed rotation velocities of late type galaxies and the observed dispersion velocities of early type galaxies at the same time ,",
    "we multiply the dispersion velocities by 1.5 to obtain the effective rotation velocities of the early type galaxies , because the rotation velocity of a late type galaxies ( @xmath18 ) and the dispersion velocity of an early type galaxy ( @xmath19 ) are respectively given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gravitational constant , @xmath22 is the constant ( @xmath23 ) , and @xmath24 is the radius of the galaxy .",
    "thus , we define internal velocities as @xmath25 for late type galaxies and @xmath26 for early type galaxies .",
    "we assume that each dark halo contains only one galaxy .",
    "actually , n - body numerical simulations show that a dark halo contained in a cluster does not contain smaller dark halos ( subhalos in a subhalo ) at least for dark halos of galaxy scales ( fig .  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is also confirmed in calculations including an n - body simulation and semi - analytic model of galaxy formation ( okamoto 2002 , private communications ) .",
    "mostly , a dark halo of galaxy scales has only one galaxy .",
    "one may think that this is because of a poor numerical resolution . however , the time scale of dynamical friction for a subhalo in a galactic scale dark halo is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath29 is the radius of the galactic scale dark halo , @xmath30 is the internal velocity of the galactic scale dark halo , and @xmath31 is the mass of a subhalo in the galactic scale dark halo @xcite .",
    "this means that for a galactic scale dark halo , most subhalos in it should have merged with the galaxy at the center of the dark halo within the time scale of cluster evolution ( @xmath32  yr ) except for very small subhalos that would be difficult to be observed .",
    "we do not discuss dark halos of group scales ( @xmath33 ) in clusters unless otherwise mentioned ; those dark halos may contain multiple galaxies .",
    "the number of galaxies included in those halos is small ( see  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig : cluster ] , we present the predicted and observed vdfs for a1367 , coma , and a2634 clusters . these clusters are relatively massive ( @xmath34 ; table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the vdfs are represented by cumulative numbers , that is , the numbers of galaxies having internal velocities larger than a certain value .",
    "the internal velocities are normalized by the velocity dispersions of galaxies in the host clusters ( @xmath35 ; table  [ tab1 ] ) , which are converted from the cluster masses using equation  ( [ eq : vint ] ) for @xmath36 for consistency with galaxy internal velocities .",
    "the observational data are complete for @xmath37 @xcite . with the observational data ,",
    "we count the two - dimensional numbers of galaxies on the celestial sphere within the angles corresponding to the cluster virial radii ( @xmath38 ; table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "then , we multiply the number by 0.7 to exclude projected galaxies within the angles but outside the cluster virial radii in the three - dimensional space . the number 0.7 is appropriate when the galaxy distribution in clusters is approximated by a power law distribution with an index of @xmath13 and has a cut off at several times the virial radii .",
    "the index of the power low distribution is consistent with observations and the results of numerical simulations if galaxy distribution follows dark matter distribution in clusters @xcite .",
    "most of the galaxies left in our samples ( @xmath39  % ) , especially for massive clusters , are early type galaxies that are mainly found in the central regions of clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : cluster ] shows that the vdfs calculated using the sps model can reproduce the observations if the galaxies in those clusters formed at redshifts of about 4 .",
    "the deviation of the observational data from the predictions at small velocities is due to the incompleteness of the observations of small galaxies . for the coma cluster ,",
    "the largest velocity point also deviates from the line .",
    "this can be attributed to the dynamical friction that forces massive galaxies to fall into the cluster center and to merge with a central cd galaxy @xcite .",
    "the derived formation redshift of the cluster galaxies is comparable to the redshift of major star formation of early type galaxies in massive clusters @xcite .",
    "since most of the galaxies in our samples are early type galaxies , this explicitly shows that early type galaxies in massive clusters are very old and have not grown for a long time in terms of their masses as well as the stars in them .",
    "mass growth of the early type galaxies ( e.g. mergers between galaxies ) may be essential for the star formation .",
    "we note that if we adopt the einstein - de sitter universe as cosmological parameters ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ) , smaller formation redshifts ( @xmath44 ) are preferable to be consistent with the observations .",
    "( 120mm,120mm)f1.eps    figure  [ fig : group ] shows the vdfs for a262 , the pegasus cluster , and the ngc 507 group . these clusters have relatively small masses ( @xmath45 ; table  [ tab1 ] ) and we here call them groups to discriminate them from the above massive clusters . for a given @xmath46 ,",
    "the mass of a subhalo in the groups is smaller than that in the massive clusters . in the hierarchical clustering scenario , less massive halos form earlier .",
    "this means that for a given redshift ( @xmath47 ) , hierarchical clustering proceeds further on the mass scale of group subhalos than on the mass scale of cluster subhalos .",
    "thus , for a large @xmath46 and @xmath2 , the predicted cumulative numbers @xmath48 of the groups are larger than those of the massive clusters ( figures  [ fig : cluster ] and  [ fig : group ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : group ] shows that contrary to a1367 , coma , and a2634 , the observed vdfs of the groups do not match the sps model predictions regardless of @xmath2 ; these groups have too many massive galaxies for their masses . for late type galaxies ,",
    "@xcite show that the observational data are complete for @xmath37 ( a262 and ngc  507 ) and @xmath49 ( pegasus ) . for early type galaxies , although the completeness of the data is not commented in the catalogue , we confirm that the data are complete at least to the completeness limit velocity of the late type galaxies from the magnitude distribution .",
    "the excess of observed galaxies in figure  [ fig : group ] suggests that the actual masses of these groups are much larger than their apparent masses estimated on the assumption that they are relaxed and virialized . for these groups",
    ", it may indicate that matter including galaxies has already been gathered through gravity , but it has not virialized and relaxed to be matured massive clusters .",
    "that is , they may be ` infant galaxy clusters ' just before virialization , although it is one of possible solutions .",
    "figure  [ fig : infant ] actually supports this interpretation .",
    "this figure shows that the theoretical predictions match the observations perfectly if the group masses are larger than their apparent masses ; the masses are assumed to be 7 times ( a262 ) , 10 times ( pegasus ) , and 16 times ( ngc 507 ) larger than their apparent masses .",
    "the group radii and velocity dispersions are increased with the group masses ( table  [ tab1 ] ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "if these groups have not fully relaxed , it is not exact to estimate the galaxy numbers within the virial radii by multiplying the observed two - dimensional numbers by 0.7 as is the case where groups are relaxed .",
    "however , at least this estimation and the comparison with the sps model predictions should be appropriate as long as the index of the galaxy distribution is not much different from @xmath13 . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , @xmath38 of each group increases as its @xmath16 and @xmath17 increase .",
    "if we assume that the galaxy density distribution is represented by @xmath50 , the number of galaxies within a radius @xmath51 has the relation of @xmath52 . since the projection of outskirt galaxies does not make significant difference between @xmath53 and @xmath38 , the increase of @xmath38",
    "is roughly consistent with this prediction .",
    "we adopt the lines of @xmath14 to be compared with the observational data because these groups are growing at present and thus @xmath2 is expected to be close to zero .",
    "in fact , while the lines of @xmath54 can also be adjusted to match the observations , the lines of a higher redshift ( @xmath55 ) can not because the slopes of these lines are different from the slopes of the observational data .",
    "this actually indicates that the galaxies formed recently in these group regions . in figure",
    "[ fig : infant ] , the deviation of the observational data from the predictions at small and large velocities can be explained by the incompleteness of observations of small galaxies and dynamical friction , respectively .",
    "we make a comment on subhalos in a subhalo here",
    ". our model does not take account of galaxies in larger subhalos of galaxy group scales .",
    "however , we can show that the number of those galaxies is small as follows .",
    "we take a1367 as an example .",
    "the expected number of subhalos with the scales of galaxy groups ( say @xmath56 ) in this cluster is only about one ( figure  [ fig : cluster ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the internal velocity @xmath57 of the subhalo is close to that of the pegasus cluster ( @xmath35 ; table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "as is shown by the lines in figure  [ fig : group ] , the expected number of galaxies in a ( sub)halo of this mass is @xmath58 of the expected number of galaxies in a1367 for a given @xmath57 .",
    "this means that the galaxies in larger subhalos do not much affect our results shown above .",
    "( 120mm,120mm)f2.eps    ( 120mm,120mm)f3.eps",
    "if the groups we investigated are infant galaxy clusters , we expect that they will relax and virialize within their dynamical time - scales ( @xmath59  yrs ) . considering the selection effect that groups having many galaxies in small regions can easily be observed , many of groups observed so far may be such infant galaxy clusters .",
    "in particular , compact galaxy groups such as the hickson groups @xcite , which are small galaxy groups that are crowded with galaxies , are good candidates of infant galaxy clusters . some of these groups may be collapsing and virializing at present .",
    "in fact , observations support the idea .",
    "first , the properties of compact groups ( e.g. the x - ray luminosities or the spatial distribution of the galaxies ) vary widely among the groups @xcite",
    ". this may reflect that we are seeing different dynamical stages of cluster or group evolution .",
    "second , hcg 62 , which is one of the hickson groups , has hard x - ray emission @xcite . this may be the result of gas accretion toward the group and the particle acceleration at the shock waves or in turbulence formed in the rapidly accreting gas ; the accelerated particles could produce the nonthermal hard x - ray emission via inverse compton scattering of photons @xcite . in the future , direct observations of matter distribution around groups through gravitational lensing will be particularly important to reveal the process of cluster formation .",
    "for example , diffuse density enhancement may be observed around some groups .",
    "it will also be important to compare the results of the sps model with those of gravitational lensing , optical , and x - ray observations for many clusters and groups systematically to reveal the whole picture of cluster formation .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite used cosmological gasdynamic simulations to investigate the accuracy of cluster mass estimates based on x - ray observations ; they found that x - ray mass estimates are very accurate and the errors are 14%-29% .",
    "however , recent x - ray observations have shown that the structure of clusters is much more complicated than the results of numerical simulations done by @xcite and have shown that many clusters have not fully relaxed .",
    "@xcite found that the fornax cluster has two distinct spatial scales of the gravitational potential .",
    "recently , chandra observatory found that clusters often have substructures with small x - ray temperatures called ` cold fronts ' @xcite .",
    "these show that clusters often have dark halos with the scales of galaxy groups , which is also shown by recent ultra - high resolution simulations @xcite . for the three groups we investigated ,",
    "the observations of x - ray temperature ( or velocity dispersion of galaxies ) might have been made only for possible central substructures , because it is often difficult to observe the x - ray temperatures ( or the velocity dispersion of galaxies ) of the relatively diffuse outer regions of the possible host clusters , especially when the host clusters are small .",
    "this could lead to the underestimation of the host cluster masses .",
    "the hard x - ray emission from hcg 62 may come from the diffuse hotter gas in the outer region of the cluster .",
    "if this kind of emission is observed in groups with an excess of galaxies , it would be an evidence that the groups are infant clusters .",
    "we study the velocity distribution functions ( vdfs ) of galaxies in clusters .",
    "we show that galaxies in some clusters stopped growing at a very early time of the universe or redshift of @xmath60 , which is comparable to the redshift of major star formation in early type galaxies in clusters . moreover , we find that some galaxy groups have too many massive galaxies for their apparent masses .",
    "one possibility is that these groups are in a transient phase and are much more massive than their apparent masses .",
    "if this is the case , they should be called ` infant galaxy clusters ' that will be matured clusters in the dynamical time - scale ( @xmath1 yrs ) .",
    "considering the selection effect for observations , many of galaxy groups observed so far may be such infant clusters .",
