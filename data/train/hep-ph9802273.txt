    "@xcite it is assumed that for processes which can be reduced to the calculation of wilson loops with quasi - static sources ( such as heavy quark potentials and soft high energy scattering amplitudes in the eikonal approximation ) the infrared behaviour of qcd can be approximated by a gaussian stochastic process in the field strength and is thus determined approximately by the correlator ( [ decom ] ) .",
    "in particular also the wilson loop average is given only in terms of ( [ decom ] ) .",
    "we know from the strong coupling expansion and lattice simulations that the wilson loop is an order parameter for confinement .",

    "it is the goal of this paper to relate the gluon correlator to the mandelstamt hooft dual superconductor mechanism of confinement @xcite . in this picture",
    "the physical essence of the confinement is the formation of color - electric flux tubes between quarks due to a dual meissner effect .",

    "olesen strings .",
    "the formation of an electric flux tube is also the consequence of the stochastic vacuum model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in an abelian projection of qcd , monopoles are the degrees of freedom responsible for confinement .",
    "monopoles condensation has been observed on the lattice ( for a review see @xcite ) and when confinement can be derived analytically ( compact electrodynamics , georgi  glashow model , and some supersymmetric yang ",

    "the monopole potential can be measured in the abelian projection and it turns out that in the confining phase it has the higgs form @xcite .",
    "lattice measurements of the distribution of monopole currents indicate that at large distances gluodynamics is equivalent to a dual abelian higgs model , the higgs particles are abelian monopoles and these are condensed in the confining phase . in the maximal abelian gauge the structure of the interquark flux tube was intensively studied and high precision measurements of the colour fields and the monopole currents recently allowed for a detailed check of the dual superconductor scenario with respect to the ginzburg ",
    "landau equations @xcite .",
    "analytic models of the infrared dynamics of dual qcd with monopoles were constructed @xcite and their phenomenological consequences intensively investigated . in the effective dual model of baker , ball and zachariasen ( dual qcd , dqcd ) , the complete semirelativistic quark - antiquark potential ,",
    "the flux tube distribution and the energy density were obtained from the numerical solution of the coupled non - linear equations of motion and compared very favourably with recent lattice data @xcite .",
    "although the lagrangian of this effective dual theory for long distance qcd is based on a non - abelian gauge group , the results for the @xmath0 potentials aside from an overall color factor can to a very good approximation be described by a ( dual ) abelian higgs model .",
    "therefore , the results are in this case largely insensitive to the details of the dual gauge group and the quarks select out only abelian configurations of the dual potential @xcite .",
    "since an effective abelian description of the infrared confining dynamics of qcd ( at least for heavy quarks ) emerges either from qcd ( via gaussian approximation and bilocal strength tensor correlators ) or via an effective abelian higgs models it becomes extremely interesting to exploit in which sense the two abelian descriptions are equivalent and , once we assume an equivalence , what kind of constraints this imposes on the form of the qcd field strength correlators . in the present work we will obtain from the dual abelian higgs model information on the form of the gauge invariant two - point field strength correlator ( [ decom ] ) and in addition we will obtain an analytic approximation for the static heavy quark potential given by the dual theory .",
    "there are two more arguments which motivate such an investigation .",
    "first , as we will discuss briefly in sec .",
    "2 , the existence of a non - vanishing form factor @xmath12 in the two - point field strength correlator of qcd seems to suggest quite naturally the existence of an effective free dual abelian theory `` behind '' the long - range dynamics of qcd .",
    "second , a recent comparison between the complete semirelativistic potentials obtained in dqcd and in the gaussian stochastic approximation of qcd in the limit of large interquark distances showed up quite striking and surprising similarities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the following analysis wants to shed some light on that .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "2 we recollect some essential features of the gauge invariant two - point correlator in qcd and we establish a relation with the wilson loop . in sec . 3 we investigate the analogous quantity in the dual abelian higgs model without sources . for a constant higgs field",
    "we reproduce a two - point correlator having the same behaviour as obtained by other authors by studying the london limit of a dual abelian higgs model . in sec .",
    "4 we introduce sources and obtain an analytic expression for the static potential .",
    "this suggests a connection between the parameters of the two - point field strength correlator in qcd and those of the dual abelian higgs model .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "5 contains some conclusions .",
    "we consider the correlator of two gluon field strengths in qcd at different space - time points , connected by a schwinger string .",
    "this string can either consist of two strings in the fundamental representation or one string in the adjoint one .",
    "for definiteness in notation we choose the first possibility and consider the quantity @xmath14 the lorentz decomposition of this correlator is given by eq .",
    "( [ decom ] ) and the results of the lattice measurements are collected in eq .",

    "@xmath12 can be different from zero .",
    "let us briefly review how a non - vanishing @xmath12 leads to confinement @xcite .    in the presence of heavy quark sources",
    "the relevant object in qcd is the wilson loop average @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a closed curve built up by the trajectories of external sources and some schwinger strings connecting the end - points . by means of the non - abelian stokes theorem @xcite one can express the wilson loop average @xmath16 in terms of an integral over a surface @xmath18 enclosed by the contour @xmath17 . a way to evaluate analytically this quantity",

    "assumption ( [ svm ] ) corresponds to the so - called stochastic vacuum model ( svm ) @xcite .",
    "the point @xmath21 is an arbitrary reference point on the surface @xmath18 needed for surface ordering .",

    "this is not surprising since in a non - abelian theory perturbative contributions beyond the tree level are surely not of a gaussian type . ]",
    "while lattice data confirm the existence of a non - vanishing form factor @xmath12 with exponential fall off , up to now there is no analytic tool which allows to calculate and to interpret the non - perturbative contributions to @xmath12 in the long - range regime .",
    "we observe , however , that a non - vanishing function @xmath12 emerges naturally if we assume that there exists an effective `` dual '' lagrangian describing an abelian gauge theory for which the dual two - point field strength correlator coincides in the long - range limit with the bilocal cumulant given by eq .",

    "we will also show the drawbacks of this approach and try to justify why we need to take into account external charge sources .",
    "this will lead to the results of sec .",
    "4 .    let us consider a very naive context , i. e. a `` dual '' vector gauge field @xmath38 minimally coupled with some external scalar field @xmath39 which we could call a higgs field .",

    ".   \\label{d1oo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the assumption that @xmath48 has the same long - range behaviour of the gauge invariant two - point field strength correlator in qcd ( see eq .",
    "( [ naiv ] ) ) is compatible with the parameterization ( [ para ] ) and leads to a correlation length @xmath13 equal to the inverse of the dual gluon mass @xmath58 .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic behaviours of @xmath59 are : @xmath60    the results shown here coincide with those obtained from the london limit of a dual abelian higgs model in @xcite .",
    "the seeming difference for what concerns the function @xmath12 is due to the fact that we have subtracted out explicitly in our definition of @xmath48 the delta singularity which in the referred work is taken into account in a regularized form .",
    "one may wonder how the result of a topologically trivial model ( no singular higgs phase ) agrees with results which take into account properly the internal abrikosov ",
    "olesen strings .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath48 is sensitive to the string only via the strength of the higgs field and this is fixed to a constant here as well as in the london limit of a dual abelian higgs model .",
    "the agreement between both approaches reveals a common weakness : the missing treatment of the interaction between the internal strings present in the dual abelian higgs model and the string between external quark sources . in ref .",
    "@xcite no external sources were introduced and the result ( [ doo])-([d1oo ] ) for the correlator was obtained in the following way .",
    "the functional integral for the abelian higgs model was rewritten in such a form as to exhibit integration over the closed surfaces of the ( internal ) strings . from the form of the contribution of a single closed surface in the london limit",
    "it was deduced that it could be obtained by a correlator like ( [ doo])-([d1oo ] ) in the gaussian approximation .",
    "implicitly this form was assumed to be valid also for external sources .",
    "when external quark sources are introduced however , the strings of those sources will interfere with the internal strings .",
    "some aspects of that phenomenon ( the linking number ) have been treated in @xcite , but to our knowledge there exists no analytic attempt to evaluate the influence on the phenomenologically relevant parameters .",
    "we notice that , due to the short - range behaviour ( [ koozero ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ d1oo ] ) reproduces the expected short - range behaviour of the function @xmath15 ( @xmath61 , see ( [ para ] ) ) . due to the short distance behaviour of the function @xmath12 , like @xmath62 , the string tension we obtained using ( [ naiv ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ doo ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , is logarithmically divergent : @xmath63 where we have used the dirac quantization condition @xmath64 , relating @xmath65 to the coupling constant @xmath66 of the dual theory .",
    "the divergence is a short - distance effect and appears to be a result of the freezing of the higgs field to the vacuum value @xmath43 , i. e. , in terms of the dual abelian higgs model , of the london limit . assuming a coordinate dependent higgs mass going to zero like @xmath67 near the origin , would yield a finite short - range behaviour of the function @xmath68 while preserving the perturbative short - range behaviour of the function @xmath69 .",
    "there is , however , no motivation for such an anisotropic behaviour of the higgs field unless we introduce some charges into the vacuum . only in such a context",
    "we can expect that near the sources and on the connecting flux tube string the higgs field vanishes while far away it assumes the vacuum value @xmath43 . this will be precisely the subject of the next section , where we will consider a dual abelian higgs model with external charges and where we will also change our intuitive duality assumption ( [ naiv ] ) to a more physically justified one",
    ". moreover , we recall here that recent lattice data @xcite confirm that in the presence of external quark sources the distribution of electric fields and monopoles currents does not fulfill the london limit .    to conclude this section we comment briefly on the translational invariance of the considered correlators .",
    "as long as @xmath39 is considered as an external field in eq .",
    "( [ kk ] ) , @xmath48 is not translational invariant and therefore in order to take advantage of the decomposition ( [ decom ] ) we have to fix our reference frame in such a way that the point @xmath70 coincides with the origin .",
    "this fact is by itself not in contradiction with the duality assumption ( [ naiv ] ) since also the correlator in the direct theory , @xmath71 , is in general not translational invariant , and only by choosing the reference point @xmath21 on the straight line connecting @xmath72 with @xmath70 is invariance recovered .",
    "finally , we notice that @xmath48 is translational invariant in some particular cases : if we assume @xmath39 constant , as we have done in this section , or partially ( in the longitudinal coordinates ) if we assume that @xmath39 depends only on some ( transverse ) coordinates .",
    "this last situation will be exploited in the next section .",
    "in this section , for the reasons stated above , we want to consider a dual abelian higgs model with external quark sources .",
    "in particular we want to make a duality assumption on the long - range behaviour of the wilson loop associated with the dynamics of a two heavy quark bound state .",
    "this assumption will take the place of our previous statement ( [ naiv ] ) .",
    "we will see that some general features will , nevertheless , be preserved .",
    "following @xcite we assume that the long - range behaviour of the wilson loop average @xmath16 associated with a two heavy quark bound state is described by the functional generator of a dual abelian higgs model with external quark sources : @xmath73 where the bracket @xmath74 means the average over the gauge fields @xmath38 and the higgs field @xmath39 .",
    "the abelian higgs model is dual in the sense that it is weakly coupled .",
    "therefore the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) can be evaluated via a classical expansion .",

    "the contribution of the higgs field to ( [ action3 ] ) vanishes and the identification is exact .    in the general case we are considering here also the higgs part gives a contribution to the non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "but let us neglect the dependence of the higgs field , via the equations of motion , on the strings and take into account the contribution coming from the higgs part as a finite contribution to the string tension .",
    "then , also in the general case , @xmath48 can be considered equivalent to the qcd two - point non - local condensate and in principle gives information on the validity of the decomposition ( [ decom ] ) and on the existence and the behaviour of the @xmath12 and @xmath15 functions .",

    "we make the assumption that these interference terms are unimportant in order to evaluate the long - range behaviour of the ( heavy quark ) wilson loop average after the duality assumption ( [ main ] ) . in this way",

    "one of the most interesting point is to relate the dimensional parameters @xmath160 and @xmath13 , the gluon condensate and the correlation length of qcd , to the dimensional parameters @xmath43 and @xmath146 , the higgs condensate and this characteristic length in the dual abelian higgs model .",
    "our derivation identifies @xmath146 with the correlation length @xmath13 and eventually explains the existence of a finite correlation length in terms of an underlying dual meissner effect that gives a mass to the dual field . in the dual theory @xcite using trace anomaly it is possible to relate the higgs condensate to the gluon condensate , @xmath161 . using the above value of @xmath43 and @xmath155 , one obtains for the gluon condensate the value found by @xcite @xmath162 .",
    "this is how originally it was shown in dqcd that the qcd vacuum is compatible with a dual superconductor on the border between type i and ii @xcite .",
    "finally , we notice that in pure gluodynamics the lowest dimensional gauge and lorentz - invariant operator has dimension four its vacuum expectation value is the gluon condensate . in the dual model we have a relevant condensate , the higgs condensate @xmath163 , of dimension two .",
    "this could yield some interesting consequences in renormalon physics @xcite .    via numerical solution of the coupled equations for @xmath38 and @xmath39 and subsequent numerical interpolation ,",
    "it is also possible to calculate the form of all semirelativistic @xmath29 potentials @xcite . in principle",
    ", we could obtain an analytic solution also for the spin dependent and velocity dependent potentials following the same line of this paper .",
    "however , to this aim the calculation of different components of the tensor @xmath164 is necessary and some technical difficulties arise due to the fact that the simple assumption ( [ cho4 ] ) is no longer valid . in the present situation we can try to gain some indications from the london limit result .",
    "although , as we have seen , this is not the right limit in which to calculate the potentials , the qualitative long - range behaviour for the field - strength correlator is reasonable .",
    "in fact , in that limiting case it is possible to calculate the whole tensor @xmath164 unambiguously in terms of some functions @xmath12 and @xmath15 ( see eq . ( [ ggoo ] ) ) .",
    "once we accept that in the presence of the quarks the short range behaviour of the higgs field would regularize these functions on the flux - tube string , using the formulas of @xcite we can express all the heavy - quark potentials in terms of integrals over these functions @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",
    "since these functions are reasonably compatible with the lattice fit ( [ para ] ) this would explain the striking similarities in the long - distance behaviour of the potentials obtained in dqcd and in the gaussian approximation of qcd @xcite .    as a final remark ,",
    "we notice that the flux tube structure between two heavy quarks has been obtained in dqcd @xcite as well as in the gaussian approximation of qcd @xcite and the result compare very favourably in both cases with the lattice calculation @xcite .",
    "the profile of the longitudinal electric field , i. e. along the string between the quarks , as a function of the transversal distance from the string is controlled by the penetration length in one case and by the correlation length in the other .",
    "under the assumption that the infrared behaviour of qcd is described by an effective abelian higgs model we have related the non - perturbative behaviour of the gauge invariant two - point field strength correlator @xmath165 in qcd with the dual field propagator in the abelian higgs model of infrared qcd . in this way the origin of the nonlocal gluon condensate is traced back to an underlying meissner effect and the phenomenological relevance of the gaussian approximation on the wilson loop is understood as following from the classical approximation in the dual theory of long distance qcd .",
    "in particular the correlation length @xmath13 of qcd , which we know from direct lattice measurements , can be expressed completely in terms of the dual theory parameters ( @xmath146 ) . as a further check",
    "we have calculated analytically the static potential and the string tension which are quantities directly related to phenomenology .",
    "it turns out that the string tension is given by an integral over a function of the correlation length which can be identified with the non - local gluon condensate .",
    "there is no cutoff introduced in this calculation since it is not performed in the london limit .",
    "we have shown that this limit is quite unphysical in the presence of sources and is valid only in the case of large distance from the chromoelectric string ( which is different from large @xmath0 distances ) .",
    "finally , these results shed some light also on the fact that the heavy quark potentials turn out to be equivalent in the svm and in dqcd at large @xmath0 distances .",
