    "large field - of - view radio telescope facilities such as the parks multi - beam facility , the arecibo multi - beam instrument , the allen telescope array ( deboer et al . 2004 ) , and the low frequency array ( falcke et al . 2007 ) have reinvigorated the radio - frequency time domain frontier .",
    "first signs of this `` revolution '' are indicated by the discoveries of new classes of radio transients .",
    "examples include : several galactic center sources ( e.g. , hyman et al . 2005 ; 2009 ) ; rotating radio anomalous transients ( rrats ; mclaughlin et al .",
    "2006 ) which represent a previously unknown class of radio pulsars , probably twice as abundant as their `` normal '' cousins ; and the powerful ( @xmath10  jy ) radio `` sparker '' , with a time scale of several milliseconds ( lorimer et al . 2007 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "2009 ) .    here , we focus on yet another emerging class of mysterious radio transients . in a novel approach ,",
    "bower et al . (",
    "2007 ) re - analyzed 944 epochs of very large array ( vla ) observations , taken about once per week for twenty two years , of a single calibration field .",
    "these authors discovered a total of ten transients , nine in the 5-ghz band and one in the 8-ghz band .",
    "these transients can be divided into two groups : `` single - epoch '' and `` multi - epoch '' transients .",
    "the eight single - epoch transients , as can be gathered by their names , were detected in only one epoch .",
    "given a single epoch detection , one can only constrain the duration of the transient by the epochs preceding and succeeding the time at which the transient was detected ( approximately one week ) .",
    "the lower limit could be as small as the typical integration time ( about 20minute ) .",
    "the two multi - epoch transients were detected after averaging over two months of data .",
    "thus , the duration of these two events can be taken to be about two months .",
    "bower et al .",
    "( 2007 ) split the data for each epoch , consisting of 20 minutes , into five segments and looked for variability on four - minute time scale .",
    "they did  not find any evidence for variability on these time scales .",
    "however , the total s / n of these detections was @xmath11 , and therefore the limits on variability within these 20-minute windows are appropriately weak .",
    "more importantly , the authors find the circular polarization is less than @xmath12 .    separately , kuniyoshi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , niinuma et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and kida et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reported on a search for radio transients using an east - west interferometer of the nasu pulsar observatory ( located in tochigi prefecture , japan ) of waseda university .",
    "the program consists of daily drift scanning of the sky towards the local zenith .",
    "these authors reported six bright radio transients ( and several other were mentioned but without details ) , with flux density above 1jy in the 1.4-ghz band .",
    "five were single epoch transients while one was detected on two successive days with flux densities of 1.7 and 3.2jy , respectively ( niinuma et al .",
    "2007 ) . in each epoch",
    "the transients were detected for about 4minutes , which is the drift scanning time , and did  not exhibit any significant variation within the observation .",
    "unfortunately , these events are not well localized and have positional uncertainties of the order of @xmath13 in declination , and @xmath14 in right ascension .",
    "kida et al .",
    "( 2008 ) stated that the 2-@xmath15 upper limit for the rate of these transients is @xmath16deg@xmath3yr@xmath4 .",
    "arguably , these events also have time scales somewhere in the range of a few minutes to a few days .",
    "therefore , later we consider the framework in which both the vla and the nasu events have a common origin .",
    "another relevant survey was conducted by levinson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who compared the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and the `` faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters '' survey ( first ; becker et al .",
    "1995 ; white et al .",
    "both these surveys were undertaken in the 1.4-ghz band and their 5-@xmath15 limits are 3.5 and 1mjy , respectively .",
    "levinson et al . ( 2002 ) identified nine radio transient candidates with flux densities greater than 6mjy .",
    "followup observations of these radio transients ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2006 ) showed that seven were spurious and the remaining two were plausible transients : an optically extincted sn in ngc  4216 from which the radio emission lasted for several years ; and vla  j172059.9@xmath17385229 ( discussed in  [ sec : vla1720 ] ) .",
    "bower et al .",
    "( 2007 ) obtained deep visible light images of their transients .",
    "they found that the multi - epoch event rt19870422 was 15 from a @xmath18 , @xmath19mag galaxy .",
    "the peak luminosity of rt19870422 , assuming that the transient is related to this galaxy , is consistent ( to an order of a magnitude ) with an energetic supernova ( sn ) similar to sn1998bw ( grb980425 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) and sn2006aj ( soderberg et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we note that the rate of these events is marginally consistent with the rate of low - luminosity grbs derived by soderberg et al .",
    "in contrast , the other multi - epoch transient rt20010331 has no optical counterpart to a limiting magnitude of @xmath20mag , @xmath21mag , and @xmath22mag ( this paper ) to within @xmath23 of the radio source .",
    "the great offset between a putative host galaxy and the radio transient make this an unusual source .",
    "we note that cenko et al .",
    "( 2008 ) presented an example of a grb in a galaxy halo environment .",
    "however , only about @xmath24 of all grbs occures in such environments .",
    "the single - epoch radio transient rt19840613 falls within the optical boundary of a @xmath25 spiral galaxy , but clearly lying outside the nucleus of the galaxy . on the basis of the radio luminosity ( assuming association with the galaxy ) and the nature of the putative host galaxy this transient is consistent with an origin similar to that of rt19870422 ( i.e. , a low luminosity grb ) .",
    "the remaining seven single - epoch transients ( one detected in 8ghz and six at 5ghz ) do not have astrometrically coincident optical , near - ir , or radio counterparts and have a point source appearance ( see table  [ tab : fasttran ] ) .",
    "this is a major clue in that a large fraction of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and most sne have detectable optical host galaxies at @xmath26mag level ( e.g. , ovaldsen et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in order to separate the events discussed above from sparkers ( lorimer et al . 2007 ; kulkarni et al . 2009 ) , which have very short time scales , we refer to these events as `` long - duration radio transients '' .    in table  [ tab : fasttran ]",
    "we summarize the observational properties of all the long - duration radio transients .",
    "we define this class as events with no optical identification and durations between hours to days .",
    "this group include the seven known sources from bower et al .",
    "( 2007 ) that are not associated with any optical counterpart and have time scales shorter than about one week ; rt19870422 ( see above ) ; and the six bright transients reported by kida et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : vla1720 ] we re - examine the case of vlaj172059.9@xmath17385229 ( levinson et al .",

    "transients can not be spurious sources of the same kind ( see also a detailed discussion in bower et al .",
    "however , given the uncertain nature of other radio transients ( e.g. , lorimer et al .",
    "2007 ; deneva et al . 2008 ) , we think that some caution is warranted .",

    "also listed in table  [ tab : fasttran ] are the flux limits , at the position of the transients , from the _ rosat_-pspc all - sky survey in the 0.122.48kev band ( voges et al .",
    "in the following we analyze the observational properties of the long - duration radio transients . specifically , we discuss their rate (  [ sec : rate ] ) , sky surface density (  [ sec : skyden ] ) , and source count function (  [ sec : sourcecountfun ] ) .",
    "bower et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the observed areal density of events at 5ghz and 8ghz ( dominated by the 5ghz events ) , with flux density above 370@xmath65jy at a two - epoch survey , is @xmath66deg@xmath3 .",
    "thus , the single epoch areal density of events with flux greater than 370@xmath65jy , is @xmath67  deg@xmath3 , where the errors are given at the 1- and 2-@xmath15 confidence ( using the formulation of gehrels 1986 ) .",
    "this is translated to a 5ghz rate of events with flux density above @xmath68jy of @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the ( unknown ) typical duration of these events and the errors are given at the 1- and 2-@xmath15 confidence .",
    "@xmath70 can be a function of frequency .",
    "therefore , comparison of this rate with rates at other frequencies should be treated with care .",
    "we are aware that our 5-ghz rate ( eq .  [ eq : rate5 ] ) is much larger than the rate computed by bower et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . however , the latter estimate was the result of an arithmetic error which once corrected yields the estimate given in equation  [ eq : rate5 ] .",
    "as can be gathered from equation  [ eq : rate5 ] , the minimum rate is achieved for the largest value of @xmath70 which is seven days . assuming a constant event rate , this minimum rate is @xmath71 ( at the @xmath6 confidence level [ cl ] ) events over the hubble time . for comparison , this estimate is several orders of magnitude larger than the population of any known galactic class of sources .",
    "therefore , if long - duration radio transients are galactic , they must be repeaters .",
    "on the other hand , if the events are catastrophic ( i.e. , single - shot , not repeaters ) then the mean time between events is @xmath72s ( and possibly as small as @xmath73s ) . the only known cosmological population with such high rate is supernovae ( @xmath74s@xmath4 ;",
    "see  [ sec : npextra ] ) .",
    "next we look into the rates of these events in the 1.4-ghz band .",
    "as noted earlier (  [ sec : vla1720 ] ) the first - nvss analysis did  not result in a firm detection of any long - duration transient .",
    "the total survey area of the first - nvss search , after correcting it for point - source incompleteness , source confusion due to the poor resolution of the nvss and missing nvss data , is 2500deg@xmath75 ( see levinson et al .",
    "2002 for details ) .",
    "we place an upper limit to the sky density ( i.e. , density of sources observed in a single epoch ) of transient sources ( flux density above 6mjy in the 1.4 ghz band ) of @xmath76deg@xmath3 and @xmath77deg@xmath3 , at the @xmath6 and @xmath78 cl , respectively .",
    "we note that this sky density is consistent with the upper limit derived by carilli , ivison & frail ( 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath6 confidence upper limit on the 1.4ghz rate , @xmath79 , of long duration radio transients with flux density above 6mjy is : @xmath80      another interesting quantity is the areal density of the transients , @xmath81 .",
    "we obtain a lower limit by dividing the number of unique sources by the angular area of the vla field .",
    "all the bower et al .",

    "within the half - power radius of @xmath85 ( corresponding to a solid angle of @xmath86deg@xmath75 ) there are four detections ( see fig .  2 in bower et al .",
    "2007 ) . at @xmath6",
    "cl the smallest number of sources is @xmath87 ( using the formulation of gehrels 1986 ) .",
    "therefore , at galactic latitude @xmath88 , @xmath89deg@xmath3 ( @xmath6 cl ) .",
    "we note that the lack of any repeater events in the bower et al .",
    "( 2007 ) sample can be used to improve this limit .",
    "this can be done by calculating the probability of choosing seven events out of @xmath90 with no repetition .",
    "however , the resulting areal density is only increased by 40% ( to the same @xmath6 cl ) .",
    "we therefore retain the simpler estimate .    assuming a constant surface density as a function of galactic latitude the all - sky surface density of radio transient progenitors is @xmath91 .",
    "we note that if the long duration radio transients are galactic then their sky surface density toward the galactic plane should be higher , and therefore the total all - sky number could be larger .",

    "a large fraction of nss may have high surface magnetic field in excess of @xmath231 g ( e.g. , magnetars ) .",

    "we note that the internal magnetic field may be higher , and therefore , equation  [ eq : emagnetic ] is a lower limit on the magnetic energy reservoir .",

    "the magnetic field is uniformly decaying on the hubble time scale , this will provide , on average , energy loss rate of @xmath234ergs@xmath4 .    another possible source of energy is heating of the ns by accretion from the ism ( e.g. , ostriker et al .",
    "assuming nss accrete at the bondi - hoyle rate ( bondi & hoyle 1944 ) , the energy - loss rate will be : @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the velocity of the ns relative to an ism with a mass ( number ) density @xmath237 ( @xmath238 ) .",

    "we note , however , that magneto hydrodynamic simulations suggest that in the presence of a strong magnetic field the accretion rate will be suppressed relative to the bondi rate ( e.g. , toropina et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 , 2005 ; see however arons & lea 1976 , 1980 ) .    to conclude , the combination of nss energy sources may provide enough energy to explain long - duration radio transients .",
    "specifically , the rotation energy of nss and the energy available for nss from accretion from the ism is at least an order of magnitude larger than needed for generating the long - duration radio transients ( eq .  [ eq : repmeane ] ) . however ,",
    "unless additional energy sources are invoked , this implies that the outbursts can not emit much higher energy at other frequencies .",
    "now we address the mechanism of radio emission .",
    "there are two possibilities : ( i ) incoherent synchrotron emission ( the afterglow model ) ; and ( ii ) coherent emission .",
    "we discuss the first possibility in this section and the second possibility in  [ sec : intp ] .    in the afterglow model",
    ", the source undergoes an explosive event and ejects relativistic particles and may generate magnetic field ( hereafter relativistic plasma ) .",
    "some sort of pressure confinement is needed to prevent rapid expansion of the relativistic plasma .",
    "otherwise the expansion or adiabatic losses vastly increase the energy budget which would be inconsistent with the old ns framework . in the case of grbs ,",
    "the afterglow is confined by the dynamic pressure of the blast wave .",
    "we return to this critical issue towards the end of the subsection .",
    "we proceed by computing the ( quasi)static properties of the ( approximately ) confined relativistic plasma .",
    "we note that the parameters derived from this model are estimated to within an order of magnitude .",
    "our simple model involves four free parameters : the radius of the emitting region , @xmath119 ; the mean electron density , @xmath245 ; the magnetic field , @xmath178 ; and the characteristic electron lorentz factor , @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is the typical electron speed in units of the speed of light .",
    "the large value of the 5ghz rate ( eq .  [ eq : rate5 ] ) relative to that at 1.4ghz rate ( eq .  [ eq : rate1 ] ) suggests that the synchrotron self absorption frequency is above 5ghz ( see  [ sec : sourcecountfun ] ) .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath248ghz , and that the optical depth at 5ghz , @xmath249 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the optical depth at the synchrotron frequency @xmath250 .    in order to estimate these parameters , we use the following relations :    \\(i ) the characteristic synchrotron frequency : @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the elementary ( electron ) charge , @xmath253 is the electron mass , and @xmath178 the magnetic field in cgs units ( i.e. , gauss ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the power emitted by a relativistic single electron due to synchrotron radiation ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) is : @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the thomson cross - section , and @xmath256 is the magnetic field energy density .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time scale , assuming @xmath250 , is given by @xmath257    \\(iii ) the brightness temperature , @xmath258 ( essentially a conveniently chosen surrogate for distance ) is : @xmath259 where @xmath260 is the frequency at which we observe ( i.e. , 5ghz ) . for optical depth larger than unity",

    "we note that @xmath270 means that there is no energy injection into the emission region after the initial burst ( i.e. , the duration of the events is dominated by the synchrotron cooling time scale ) .",
    "however , if energy is injected then @xmath271 .",
    "the following solution holds for @xmath272 and @xmath273 : @xmath274 @xmath275 @xmath276 and the lower limit on @xmath277 is    @xmath278    we note that in order to minimize the energy , @xmath245 should be around the lower limit implied by equation  [ eq : sym_ne ] . for convenient we also give the brightness temperature : @xmath279    next , we can derive the ratio between the magnetic energy and electron energy densities : @xmath280 where @xmath281 is the electrons energy density .",
    "we note that @xmath282 is very sensitive to both the duration , @xmath283 , and the synchrotron frequency , @xmath264 , whose values are not well known . therefore , a small change in these unknown parameters will change @xmath282 dramatically ( see also readhead 1994 ) .",
    "we note that by setting @xmath284 , we have ensured that @xmath258 is equal to the equipartition brightness temperature ( readhead 1994 ) and minimized the energy requirement .",

    "therefore , inverse - compton effects can be neglected .    assuming the electron density is close to the minimum density implied by equation  [ eq : sym_ne ] , the total energy in a single burst ( i.e. , in both the electrons and magnetic field ) is given by : @xmath289 \\cr    &        & + 1\\times10^{34 }              \\big [              \\big ( \\frac{\\nu_{{\\rm s}}}{2\\times10^{11}\\,{\\rm hz } } \\big)^{-5/3 }              \\big ( \\frac{t_{{\\rm syn}}}{0.5\\,{\\rm day } } \\big)^{-11/6 } \\cr    &        & \\times               \\big ( \\frac{s_{\\nu}}{0.4\\,{\\rm mjy } } \\big)^{3/2 }              \\big ( \\frac{d}{1\\,{\\rm kpc } } \\big)^{3 }              \\big]\\,{\\rm erg}. \\label{eq : syn_totalpower}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the specific values we have selected , @xmath269hz and @xmath290day , give a solution which is near equipartition and therefore minimizes the energy . for @xmath245 close to its minimum implied by equation  [ eq : sym_ne ] ,",

    "( _ black _ contours ) and total energy ( _ gray _ contours ) , @xmath294 , as a function of @xmath264 and @xmath283 , and assuming @xmath267kpc , and @xmath295mjy .",

    "[ fig : syn_model_nu_s_t_dur],width=321 ]    it is interesting to compare the derived radius , @xmath296 cm , with some typical radii dominating ns physical processes .",
    "the light - cylinder radius is : @xmath297 the co - rotation radius of a ns is : @xmath298 assuming a bondi - hoyle accretion rate : @xmath299 where @xmath300 is the proton mass , then the magnetosphere radius is : @xmath301 where @xmath65 is the magnetic dipole moment of the ns .",
    "finally , the accretion radius is : @xmath302    as noted at the beginning of the sub - section rapid expansion of the radiating plasma would vastly increase the energy budget .",
    "for this reason , an integral requirement of the incoherent model is that the plasma must be confined ( in which case the duration of the event is set by the cooling time or by the duration of the injection of energy by the source ) .",
    "we note that the confinement radius should probably be smaller than the light cylinder radius .",
    "otherwise , the energy requirement will be larger due to the inertia of the electrons .",
    "the equipartition radius we find ( eq .  [ eq : syn_r ] ) is a little bit larger than the plausible confinement radius ( e.g. , eq .",
    "[ eq : r_lc ] ) .",
    "however , our calculation provides only an order of a magnitude estimate to the fireball parameters and the equipartition radius in particular .",
    "therefore , we can not rule out the incoherent synchrotron model based on the small inconsistency between the equipartition radius and light cylinder radius .    assuming a dipole magnetic field , decaying as @xmath303 ( inside the light cylinder radius ; eq .",
    "[ eq : r_lc ] ) , and @xmath304 g at @xmath305 cm , the extrapolated magnetic field strength on the surface of a 10 km radius ns will be about : @xmath306 this is higher than the typical estimated surface magnetic fields of pulsars and magnetars .",
    "however , for somewhat larger @xmath264 or @xmath283 the discrepancy is smaller .",
    "moreover , the events may be related to the release of magnetic energy stored in the ns interior .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the incoherent synchrotron model can not be ruled out .",
    "finally , we note that the total mass of matter within the emission radius is @xmath307gr .",
    "interestingly , this mass is similar to the total amount of matter that a ns with a space velocity of 150kms@xmath4 will accrete from the ism ( assuming @xmath308cm@xmath148 and bondi - hoyle accretion ) within several months , which is the typical time interval between bursts that we found in  [ sec : e ] .",
    "we note that treves , colpi & lipunov ( 1993 ) suggested that accreted matter from the ism is piled up near the alfvn radius , followed by infall of the piled up matter on the ns .",
    "they estimated that these episodic infalls may occur every several months .",
    "in recent years , several types of pulsars with small duty cycles have been discovered .",
    "this includes the rrats ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "2006 ) , and intermittent pulsars ( kramer et al .",
    "several models were suggested to explain such episodic pulsars ( e.g. , treves et al 1993 ; zhang , gil & dyks 2006 ; cordes & shannon 2008 ) .",
    "however , their evolutionary status is still unclear .",
    "known intermittent pulsars and rrats have characteristic ages similar to those of `` normal '' pulsars ( i.e. , @xmath310yr ) . however , as we discussed in  [ sec : ions_skyden ] , the long - duration radio transients can not be associated exclusively with pulsars younger than about 1gyr , otherwise their predicted surface density will not be consistent with the observations (  [ sec : skyden ] ) .    as shown in  [ sec : e ] , in the framework of galactic nss , the duty cycle of the long - duration radio transients is @xmath311 .",
    "such a small duty cycle will make it hard to detect them as repeaters in current pulsars searches .",
    "in addition , most pulsar searches are conducted at low frequencies ( @xmath312ghz ) , in which the rate of the long - duration radio transients seems to be low .",
    "thus , a prediction of this model is that high frequency ( say 5ghz ) searches should find a much larger rate of long duration radio transients .",
    "the flat spectrum ( @xmath313 ) of the long duration transients is reminiscent of the radio spectrum of magnetars in their `` active state '' ( cf .",
    "camilo et al . 2006 ) .",
    "thus , a plausible model is that the long duration transients are ancient magnetars in short lived high states .",
    "next we derive a physical distance to the bright events discussed by kida et al .",
    "we remind the reader that these events are about a thousand times brighter than the vla events .",
    "we use a modified rayleigh test ( see fisher et al .",

    "if correct , this may prove to be the most practical way , so far , to find old nss in our galaxy and explore their demographics .",
    "specifically , the demography of old nss constitute an excellent probe of the star formation history and metal enrichment of the galaxy , and the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",

    "first , if indeed long - duration radio transients are associated with isolated old nss , then we expect them to be distributed inhomogeneously on the celestial sphere .",
    "specifically , this hypothesis predicts that faint sub - mjy long - duration radio transients will be at least a few times more common in the galactic center than in high galactic latitude .",
    "the exact ratio , however , depends on the distance scale to these events .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ns_skydistribution ] which shows the expected approximate distribution of isolated old nss on the celestial sphere , for the entire ns population and ns which are at distance smaller than 1kpc from the sun .",
    "finally , we note that if the radio emission from such sources is pulsating , then pulsars searches conducted at 5ghz will find these objects .",
    "the fact that such `` pulsars '' were not found in existing surveys may be due to the fact that the majority of pulsars searches are carried on in low frequencies in which the rate of these transients is low .",
