    "<S> the milnor conjecture has been a driving force in the theory of quadratic forms over fields , guiding the development of the theory of cohomological invariants , ushering in the theory of motivic cohomology , and touching on questions ranging from sums of squares to the structure of absolute galois groups . here </S>",
    "<S> , we survey some recent work on generalizations of the milnor conjecture to the context of schemes ( mostly smooth varieties over fields of characteristic @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , a version of the milnor conjecture fails to hold for certain smooth complete @xmath1-adic curves with no rational theta characteristic ( this is the work of parimala , scharlau , and sridharan ) . </S>",
    "<S> we explain how these examples fit into the larger context of the unramified milnor question , offer a new approach to the question , and discuss new results in the case of curves over local fields and surfaces over finite fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the first cases of the ( as of yet unnamed ) milnor conjecture were studied in pfister s habilitationsschrift @xcite in the mid 1960s . as pfister @xcite himself points out , `` </S>",
    "<S> [ the milnor conjecture ] stimulated research for quite some time . '' indeed , it can be seen as one of the driving forces in the theory of quadratic forms since milnor s original formulation @xcite in the early 1970s .    </S>",
    "<S> the classical cohomological invariants of quadratic forms ( rank , discriminant , and clifford  hasse  </S>",
    "<S> witt invariant ) have a deep connection with the history and development of the subject . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they are used in the classification ( hasse  minkowski local - global theorem ) of quadratic forms over local and global fields . </S>",
    "<S> the first `` higher invariant '' was described in arason s thesis @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the celebrated results of merkurjev @xcite and merkurjev  </S>",
    "<S> suslin @xcite settled special cases of the milnor conjecture in the early 1980s , and served as a starting point for voevodsky s development of the theory of motivic cohomology . </S>",
    "<S> other special cases were settled by arason  elman  </S>",
    "<S> jacob @xcite and jacob  </S>",
    "<S> rost @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> voevodsky s motivic cohomology techniques @xcite ultimately led to a complete solution of the milnor conjecture , for which he was awarded the 2002 fields medal .    </S>",
    "<S> the consideration of quadratic forms over rings ( more general than fields ) has its roots in the number theoretic study of lattices ( i.e.quadratic forms over @xmath2 ) by gauss as well as the algebraic study of division algebras and hermitian forms ( i.e.  quadratic forms over algebras with involution ) by albert . </S>",
    "<S> a general framework for the study of quadratic forms over rings was established by bass @xcite , with the case of ( semi)local rings treated in depth by baeza @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bilinear forms over dedekind domains ( i.e.  unimodular lattices ) were studied in a number theoretic context by frhlich @xcite , while the consideration of quadratic forms over algebraic curves ( and their function fields ) was initiated by geyer , harder , knebusch , scharlau @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of quadratic ( and bilinear ) forms over schemes was developed by knebusch @xcite , @xcite , and utilized by arason @xcite , dietel @xcite , parimala @xcite , @xcite , fernndez - carmena @xcite , sujatha @xcite , @xcite , arason  </S>",

    "<S> further enrichment came eventually from the triangulated category techniques of balmer @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and walter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this article will focus on progress in generalizing the milnor conjecture to these contexts .    </S>",
    "<S> these remarks grew out of a lecture at the rims - camp - style seminar `` galois - theoretic arithmetic geometry '' held october 19 - 23 , 2010 , in kyoto , japan . </S>",
