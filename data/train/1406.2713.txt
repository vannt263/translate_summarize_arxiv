    "surveys of the large scale structures have been providing insightful data for more than a decade now .",
    "observational projects such as the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have yielded unprecedented measurements of the clustering of matter on the large scales .",
    "these observations have made possible the first detection of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) signal @xcite and provided constraints on model parameters that are complementary to those obtained from other standard cosmological probes .",
    "the success of these projects has opened the way to a new generation of survey programs .    in the years to come the dark energy survey ( des ) , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) or the euclid mission will map the distribution of galaxies in larger cosmic volumes and with higher sensitivity . through a variety of probes , these surveys aim to achieve a few percent error on the determination of several cosmological parameters",
    "however , multiple challenges need to be addressed . from the theoretical point of view one of the most challenging aspects",
    "concerns the availability of robust theoretical predictions of the clustering of matter at small scales , which is crucial to correctly interpret the data and infer unbiased constraints on model parameters .    at small scales and late times",
    "the gravitational collapse becomes a highly non - linear process .",
    "thus , model predictions can not rely on standard linear perturbation theory and require solving the complex dynamics of matter collapse through numerical simulations .",
    "the need for accurate predictions of the clustering of matter over large interval of scales has driven up the demand for large volume high - resolution n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "as an example the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has recently determined the cosmic distance scale to one percent accuracy from measurements of the bao spectrum in the range of modes @xmath6<0.30 $ ] @xcite .",
    "future surveys such as lsst or euclid will push these measurements even further by probing the clustering of matter up to @xmath7 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "predicting the matter power spectrum in such a large interval of scales at a few percent level is a very challenging task since it requires n - body simulations that cover very large cosmic volumes to reduce cosmic variance uncertainties at low @xmath8 and with sufficient mass and spatial resolution to limit numerical systematic errors at large @xmath8 . to tackle this challenge @xcite have realised a series of n - body simulations , the dark energy universe simulation full universe runs ( deus - fur ) , covering a cosmic volume of @xmath9 with @xmath10 particles which has allowed to resolve the bao spectrum to @xmath11 accuracy level @xcite",
    "however , this is still not sufficient to correctly interpret the data since an unbiased statistical analysis also require knowledge of the covariance matrix .",
    "addressing this issue is the goal of the analysis presented here .",
    "if the initial matter density field is gaussian distributed , during the linear regime its fourier modes evolve independently and the covariance of the matter power spectrum has a simple diagonal form .",
    "from now on we will refer to this configuration as the gaussian case , for which errors on the band powers are uncorrelated .",
    "in contrast at small scales and late times the covariance develops non - vanishing off - diagonal terms which account for the mode coupling caused by the non - linear regime of gravitational collapse . in such a case the errors on band powers become correlated causing a larger dispersion on power spectrum measurements @xcite . neglecting such correlations may lead to biased results as shown by several studies of weak lensing observables ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to a biased determination of bao parameters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the future generation of large scale structure surveys will need estimates of the covariance matrix which require sampling the matter power spectrum from large samples of n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "we undertake this task using a set of simulations @xmath12 of the concordance @xmath0cdm model from the dark energy universe simulation parallel universe runs ( deus - pur ) . by combining this large ensemble with an auxiliary set of high resolution runs we estimate the impact of the mass resolution of the simulations on the 3d matter density power spectrum covariance matrix .",
    "we show that mass resolution effects can be an important source of uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , our analysis clearly indicates the necessity of using large n - body datasets when studying the matter power spectrum distribution at small scales and low redshifts .",
    "in particular we find significant deviations from expectations of a gaussian density field which were overlooked in previous studies .",
    "this has potentially important implications for inferring unbiased power spectrum measurements for future survey programs .",
    "our work extends the analysis of @xcite to a larger statistical sample of n - body simulations with higher mass resolution and better spatial resolution .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ nbodydata ] we describe the characteristics of the deus - pur simulations . in section [ deuspurcov ]",
    "we present the analysis of the deus - pur covariance matrix , while in section [ pdfsec ] we show the results of the computation of the probability distribution of the matter power spectrum . in section [ sn ]",
    "we discuss the effect of non - gaussian errors on the signal - to - noise of power spectrum measurement .",
    "finally we present our conclusion in section [ conclu ] .",
    "we use the n - body simulation dataset from deus - pur project .",
    "this consists of 12288 simulations of a flat @xmath0cdm model with parameters ( see table [ tab : cosmopar ] ) calibrated to the wmap-7yr data  @xcite of a cosmological volume of @xmath1 with @xmath2 particles , for a formal mass resolution of @xmath13 ( set a ) , and 96 simulations of the same cosmological model and equal volume with @xmath3 particles , corresponding to a mass resolution of @xmath14 ( set b ) .",
    "these runs have been realised with  a multiple purpose application for dark energy universe simulation \" ( amadeus ) @xcite .",
    "this workflow application includes a dynamical solver based on ramses  @xcite , an adaptive mesh refinement code with a tree - based data structure that allows recursive grid refinement on a cell - by - cell basis , in which particles are evolved using a particle - mesh ( pm ) solver , while the poisson equation is solved using a multigrid method @xcite . in the case of the deus - pur simulations",
    "the refinement criterion is set such as to allow up to 6 levels of refinement ."
