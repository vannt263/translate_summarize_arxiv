    "in a two - dimensional electron gas in the partially filled lowest landau level , a predominant role is played by the interaction between the electrons , which sets the energy scale of the problem . while the qualitative properties of the quantum hall states are mostly unaffected by the precise form of the interaction , the value of some quantities , as the energy gap in the incompressible hall states",

    "the physical relevant interaction between the electrons is the electrostatic coulomb interaction .",

    "@xcite    the chern - simons composite fermions are constructed attaching an even numbers @xmath7 of flux quanta to the electrons ;  @xcite this transformation can be realized introducing an appropriated chern - simons gauge field .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , the external magnetic field is partially screened , but a long ranged , gauge - mediated interaction between the new fermions has been introduced .    at the mean - field level",
    ", the system can be described in terms of free composite fermions in a constant effective magnetic field @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the filling factor and @xmath10 the electron density .",
    "choosing @xmath11 at half - filling ( @xmath12 ) gives @xmath13 ; the ground state of the system is then the fermi sea of composite fermions , with fermi momentum @xmath14 . along the main jain series , which is determined by the filling factors @xmath15 for integer @xmath16 , the fractional quantum hall states correspond to the integer quantum hall states for composite fermions in the residual magnetic field @xmath17 , with @xmath16 landau levels filled .",
    "more generally , the mean - field picture predicts the occurrence of fractional quantum hall states at filling factors that corresponds to integer filling factors for the composite fermions .",
    "these predictions are believed to be correct , providing that the interaction belongs to a well - defined class of `` hard - core '' repulsive interactions .",
    "@xcite in this case , the qualitative properties of the quantum hall states do not depend on the precise form of the interactions .",
    "we are interested in the energy gap of the incompressible quantum hall state at @xmath15 , which corresponds to the energy required to create a quasiparticle and a quasihole infinitely far apart . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the energy gap is given by the separation of the landau energy levels in the residual magnetic field @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , the mean - field energy gap at @xmath15 falls off as @xmath19 in the limit of large @xmath16 ; however , the energy scale of the mean - field gap is set by the cyclotron energy @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the band mass of the electrons , and not by the interaction energy as expected .    in order to include the effects of gauge fluctuations , halperin , lee and read ( hlr )  @xcite",
    "conjectured that the energy gap of the quantum hall states belonging to the main jain series is given by the cyclotron energy of the composite fermions in the residual magnetic field @xmath22 , with the bare mass of the quasiparticles replaced by their effective mass @xmath23 at the gap energy @xmath24 , @xmath25 this equation for the energy gap will be referred to as the hlr - gap equation .",
    "halperin _ et al_. have computed in their seminal paper  @xcite the effective mass of the composite fermions for various interactions , including the gauge fluctuations up to the one - loop level .",
    "they concluded that the effective mass of the composite fermions diverges at the fermi level for short range and coulomb interactions , while remaining finite for long range interactions . in the case of the coulomb interaction , the effective mass of the composite fermions",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dielectric constant , and the dots represent subleading terms .",
    "stern and halperin  @xcite argued that this result is exact to all orders in perturbation theory , up to finite contributions from short wavelengths . for short range interactions of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 , the divergence of the effective mass obeys the power law  @xcite @xmath30 moreover , in the one - loop approximation , the imaginary part of the effective mass @xmath31 diverges with the same rate as its real part does .",
    "these results suggest that , at half - filling , the fermi velocity @xmath32 goes to zero , and that the lifetime of the quasiparticles is vanishingly short .",
    "@xcite in particular , the fermi liquid description of the compressible hall states at half - filling with short range interaction is expected to break down .",
    "this picture is consistent with the renormalization group analysis proposed by nayak and wilczek .",
    "@xcite indeed , using an approach inspired by the @xmath33 expansion , nayak and wilczek showed that the fermi liquid description of the fermion - chern - simons theory is a fixed point of the renormalization group flow as long as the interaction is long ranged .",
    "for short range interactions , the theory flows aways from the fermi liquid fixed point toward strong coupling , eventually leading to a breakdown of the fermi liquid description .",
    "the theory with coulomb interaction is marginal ; it flows toward the weak - interacting fixed point , but the two - point correlation function for the composite fermions exhibits at low energy a non - fermi liquid behavior @xmath34 .",
    "the question of the physical meaning of the divergent effective mass has to be addressed in terms of gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "for instance , the singular self - energy leading to a divergence of the effective mass is a gauge - dependent quantity . in the gauge - invariant density - density and current - current correlation functions , important cancellations between the self - energy corrections and the vertex corrections due to ward identities",
    "lead to a fermi liquid behavior for all ratios of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite however , other gauge - invariant quantities such as the specific heat  @xcite are sensitive to the singularity in the effective mass . in this context",
    ", kim and lee  @xcite showed that for the coulomb interaction , the singular part of the specific heat of the composite fermion system predicted by the quasiparticle approximation coincides with the singular part of the specific heat obtained from the free energy of the gauge field . for short range interactions , both results for the specific heat",
    "disagree , and they concluded that the landau quasiparticle approximation is valid only for the coulomb interaction .",
    "aware of the limitations of the fermi liquid approach for short range interactions , we might still try to use it to compute some properties of the incompressible hall states near half - filling .",
    "in particular , we may hope that the quasiparticle approximation will make valid qualitative predictions for the behavior of the energy gap along the main jain series as function of @xmath16 .    for the coulomb interaction , the hlr - gap equation  ( [ eq : hlr conjecture ] )",

    "we interpret the appearance of imaginary parts both in the effective mass and in the energy gap as a signature of the breakdown of the composite fermion approach .",
    "the loop expansion relies on the smallness of the gauge fluctuations around its mean - field value . for long range interactions ,",
    "long wavelength gauge fluctuations are suppressed , and the fcs approach is justified ; the effective mass and energy gap are finite and real . however , since both long and short wavelength contributions are equally important , the fcs approach is not appropriated to give an approximation for the effective mass or the energy gap in this case .    for short range interactions ,",
    "the gauge field may fluctuate strongly , eventually leading to the breakdown of the fcs picture ; any prediction has , therefore , to include all orders in the loop expansion . in doing so",
    ", we could compute the power - law behavior of the most divergent part of the effective mass , and the @xmath16 dependency of the energy gap ; the contributions coming from short wavelengths are subleading , and may be neglected in this context .",
    "the coulomb interaction is marginal : the long wavelength gauge fluctuations are sufficiently suppressed by the long range interaction to allow loop expansion , but remain strong enough to produce a divergence in the effective mass , which can then be obtained exactly by a one - loop calculation including only long wavelength fluctuations .    this paper is constructed as follows .",
