    "a light third generation of superpartners remains an attractive possibility to realize weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite in nature even after the successful completion of the 8 tev run of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "moreover , if a light top squark ( stop ) @xmath0 is the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) just above the lightest neutralino ( @xmath1 ) , the lightest and stable susy particle ( lsp ) in the r - parity conserving version of the minimally supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , it would have a significant density to coexist with the lsp around the freeze - out time , and annihilations involving @xmath0 with the lsp @xcite can help achieve the lsp relic density consistent with the upper bound @xmath12 presented by the planck collaboration @xcite .",
    "such a light @xmath0 with a very small mass difference with the lsp ( @xmath13 50 gev ) will dominantly decay to a charm quark and the lsp @xcite resulting in a final state with jets and missing transverse . owing to the small @xmath14",
    ", both the charm jet and the @xmath15 will be extremely soft on average making this scenario very challenging to discover experimentally @xcite .",
    "the atlas collaboration has recently excluded a @xmath0 mass of 200 gev ( 95% c.l . ) in this channel for using 20.3 fb@xmath11 of data collected at the 8 tev run of the lhc @xcite .",
    "this result clearly shows the low sensitivity of the current experimental searches to probe the degenerate stop nlsp region .",
    "hence , it is extremely important to consider other possible signatures of light third generation susy in the stop nlsp scenario .",
    "interestingly , in this region of the susy parameter space the heavier stop @xmath2 can also be below or around the tev scale and it could prove useful to also look for them at the lhc .",
    "motivated by this , we , in this paper , propose a novel search strategy to look for signatures of @xmath2 at the 14 tev run of the lhc .",
    "note that the signatures of @xmath2 production at the lhc has not received enough attention in the literature in the recent past primarily because of the comparatively lower cross - section ( due to its heaviness ) mass which in turn forced them to assume new f - term or d - term contributions to the higgs mass beyond the mssm . ] .",
    "however , with a few hundred @xmath16 integrated luminosity expected at the 14 tev lhc , the @xmath2 production processes could be promising and can even provide information complimentary to the @xmath0 production channels .    in this paper , we consider the pair production of @xmath17 and their subsequent decay to either @xmath18 or @xmath19 final states ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "note that , for the two above decays to have considerable branching ratios it is necessary to have adequate left - right mixing in the stop mass matrix @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the large radiative corrections to the higgs mass required for the consistency with the experimental observation also prefers the left and right handed top squarks to be highly mixed .",
    "hence , the two decay modes @xmath5 and @xmath20 are indeed very well motivated , in particular in the context of the higgs discovery . in addition , if most of the electroweak gauginos except the lsp , and the sbottoms are rather heavy which can indeed happen in a large region of the susy parameter space , the branching ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath18 or @xmath19 can be significant .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     note that the main difference between the two models in table-[tab : spectrum ] is in the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "as the model:2 has higher values of these masses the mass gap between @xmath2 and @xmath0 is is smaller which in turn makes both the @xmath0 and the @xmath7 or @xmath3 less boosted .",
    "as we already mentioned in the introduction , the relevant processes of our interest are @xmath21 there are several sm processes which can mimic our signal . they are all listed in table-[tab1 ] .",
    "although , two @xmath7 or higgs bosons are absent in most of the backgrounds , in practice there is always a possibility of @xmath22 boson being mis - tagged as a @xmath7 or even a higgs boson .",
    "this fraction might not be very large but considering the gigantic cross sections for some of the backgrounds compared to the signal , the final contribution might not be negligible .",
    "thus , a detailed simulation of all the background processes is necessary to make reliable predictions as we present in the next section .    as the mass gap between @xmath23 and @xmath24 is not so small in our case both the decay products of @xmath23 namely ,",
    "@xmath24 and the @xmath7 or the @xmath3 are expected to be moderately boosted .",
    "we thus consider the the fully hadronic decays of the @xmath7 or the @xmath3 in order to be able to reconstruct them using the jet substructure technique . here",
    "we adopt the method proposed by butterworth , davison , rubin and salam ( bdrs ) @xcite for tagging the hadronically decaying @xmath7 or the higgs boson .",
    "we briefly describe below the exact procedure used in our analysis along with our other selection criteria .    as the first step of this algorithm",
    ", we construct `` fat - jets '' using the cambridge - aachen algorithm ( ca algorithm ) @xcite as implemented in the fastjet package @xcite with @xmath25 parameter of 1.0 .",
    "we demand that the fat - jets satisfy @xmath26 200 gev and pseudo rapidity @xmath27 @xmath28 3.0 .",
    "we then take a fat - jet @xmath29 and undo its last clustering step to get the two subjets @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 by convention .",
    "the two quantities @xmath35= @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the distance between @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the @xmath39-@xmath40 plane , are then computed .",
    "if there is significant mass drop i.e. , @xmath41 and the splitting of the fat - jet @xmath29 into @xmath30 and @xmath31 is fairly symmetric i.e. , @xmath42 then we continue otherwise we redefine @xmath43 and perform the same set of steps as describes above on @xmath30 .",
    "the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are tunable parameters of the algorithm and are set to 0.67 and 0.10 respectively in our analysis .",
    "if the above two conditions @xmath41 and @xmath46 are satisfied then the mother jet @xmath29 is taken and its constituents are re - clustered into ca jets with @xmath47 resulting in a number of jets @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , ..... @xmath51 ordered in descending @xmath52 .",
    "the vector sum of the first three hardest jet momenta is then considered as the higgs candidate .",
    "the last step ( the so called `` filtering '' procedure ) is known to captures the dominant @xmath53 radiation from the higgs decay , while eliminating much of the contamination from underlying events @xcite .    once the bdrs procedure is applied on the fat - jets , we then impose the following selection criteria on the events :     process & production & & simulated & s1 & s2 & s3 & s4 & s5 & s6 & final & @xmath54 + & cross - section & & events & & & & & & & cross - section ( fb ) & ( 100 fb@xmath11 ) +   + model:1 & 10 fb & @xcite & @xmath55 & 6012 & 4902 & 2736 & 2359 & 2143 & 1718 & 17.2 @xmath56 & 4.3 + model:2 & 10 fb & @xcite & @xmath55 & 6170 & 5319 & 2813 & 2421 & 2081 & 1853 & 18.5 @xmath56 & 4.6 +   + @xmath57 & 833 pb & @xcite & @xmath58 & 221747 & 148580 & 142 & 41 & 26 & 11 & 9.1 @xmath56 + @xmath59 & 1.12 pb & @xcite & 226110 & 2484 & 1444 & 8 & 7 & 1 & 1 & 0.5 @xmath56 + @xmath60 & 770 fb & @xcite & 276807 & 1365 & 787 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 0.5 @xmath56 + @xmath61 & 700 fb & @xcite & 231064 & 1893 & 1027 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 0.6 @xmath56 + @xmath62 & 64 pb & @xcite & 6518431 & 7596 & 5801 & 13 & 9 & 3 & 3 & 2.9 @xmath56 + @xmath63 & 500 fb & @xcite & 313350 & 1475 & 1093 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 2 & 0.3 @xmath56 + @xmath64 & & & & & & & & & & + @xmath65 & 5.5",

    "are mostly not highly boosted we use a comparatively large @xmath25 parameter @xmath68 in order to not lose most of the top quarks from the backgrounds .",
    "we set the other parameters of the jhtoptagger algorithm @xcite to be @xmath69 , @xmath70 , cos@xmath71 and the @xmath22 mass window = ( 60 - 100 ) gev .",
    "we demand the final reconstructed top mass to fall in the window ( 158.3 - 188.3 ) gev .",
    "we do not demand any b - tag for the reconstruction .",
    "an event is discarded if any of the fat - jets reconstructs to a top quark by the above criteria .",
    "+ as we do not also expect any hard leptons in the signal we veto events which has any lepton with @xmath72 gev and @xmath73 .",
    "in addition to that , we also demand that the number of normal @xmath74 anti-@xmath75 jets @xcite with @xmath72 gev and @xmath73 be less than 6 . note that this step kills the multi - jet background configurations e.g. , @xmath76 + additional hard jets while keeping almost all the signal events . *",
    "s3 : as @xmath2 is quite heavier than both @xmath0 and the @xmath7 or @xmath3 , the @xmath0 in the decay @xmath77 is expected to be rather energetic and a large part of its energy will be carried out by the lsp .",
    "hence , even though @xmath14 is rather small the lsp will be quite energetic to record a high @xmath15 in the detectors .",
    "a strong cut @xmath78 gev reduces the backgrounds by a huge amount while keeping a handful of signal events . *",
    "s4 : the charm jet from the decay of @xmath0 being very soft the topology of the decay @xmath79 looks exactly like the one where a mother particle decays to a visible daughter particle and an invisible particle .",
    "this observation motivates us to construct the stransverse mass @xmath8 @xcite out of the reconstructed @xmath7 and/or the @xmath3 momenta and the missing transverse momentum .",
    "the @xmath8 constructed in this way should be distributed till the @xmath2 mass for the signal while the backgrounds are expected to populate the low mass region because there is no such heavy mother particle for the backgrounds . requiring a large value of @xmath8 , @xmath80 gev , helps us to tame the backgrounds efficiently . *",
    "s5 : the distribution of the effective mass of the system , @xmath81 , being strongly correlated to @xmath82 for the signal , is expected to occupy much higher mass region compared to the background . in our analysis , we require @xmath83 gev to reduce the backgrounds further . *",
    "s6 : as the last step of our analysis we demand that there be no more than two normal jets ( anti-@xmath75 , @xmath74 , @xmath72 gev and @xmath73 as in s2 ) with @xmath84 with the two reconstructed @xmath7 or the @xmath3 .",
    "we then also demand that none of these two jets are b - tagged .",
    "we use a 70% efficiency for b - tagging and the rate for a c - jet ( light jet ) mis - tagged as a b - jet to be 15% ( 1% ) @xcite .",
    "we use pythia6.4.24@xcite for generating the signal events . for",
    "most of the the backgrounds , we use madgraph5 @xcite to generate parton level events and subsequently use the madgraph - pythia6 interface ( including matching of the matrix element hard partons and shower generated jets following the mlm prescription @xcite as implemented in madgraph5 ) to perform the showering and implement our event selection cuts .",
    "in table-[tab1 ] we show the number of signal events for our two benchmark models as well as all the backgrounds after each of the selection criteria described in the previous section has been used . in the column:10",
    "we show the final cross section when all the selection cuts have been imposed .",
    "note that the number of events simulated for all the backgrounds is more than the numbers of events expected at the 14 tev lhc with 100fb@xmath11 integrated luminosity .",
    "thus , our estimation of the backgrounds is expected to be quite robust . in the first column",
    "the numbers within the brackets show the maximum number of additional jets which has been generated in madgraph . for the @xmath76 background",
    "we have generated a huge number ( @xmath85 ) of events in pythia6 ( that means without additional hard jets ) and checked that our background estimate agree with a smaller sample of mlm matched @xmath76 + jets events generated in madgraph .",
    "we have also checked that the contribution of the processes @xmath86 + jets , @xmath87 + jets , @xmath88 + jets , @xmath89 + jets and @xmath90 + jets to the background is negligible .    in the ultimate column of table-[tab1 ]",
    "we show the signal significance for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath11 . while calculating the significance ( @xmath91 ) we use the simple recipe of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 being the total number of signal and background events . any additional systematic uncertainty ( which is difficult to estimate in a phenomenological study ) might change the significance somewhat but will not change the conclusion of our analysis in any significant way .",
    "it can be seen that that a significance @xmath95 4 - 5 can be obtained with approximately 100 fb@xmath11 of data set .    in conclusion , we have considered the possibility of detecting a susy signal for the light stop nlsp scenario by considering the pair production of the heavier stop quark instead of the commonly considered light stop pair production channel .",
    "we have focused on the two decay channels @xmath5 and @xmath20 giving rise to the spectacular di - boson + missing transverse energy final state . employing the jet substructure techniques to reconstruct the hadronically decaying @xmath7 and/or higgs momenta , which also enables us to construct the @xmath8 out of the di - boson momenta and the @xmath15 , we have shown that a signal can be seen at the 14 tev lhc with about 100 fb@xmath11 integrated luminosity .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that there is region of mssm parameter space where the decay @xmath20 itself can also be substantial @xcite and the possibility to see even just the di - higgs signal should be investigated .",
    "this could also be important in the context of higgs self - coupling measurements which is extremely important in our endeavor to look for signatures of new physics beyond the sm .",
