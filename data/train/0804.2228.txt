    "e.p.wigner in @xcite and @xcite showed that the level density ( one point correlation ) of `` border matrix '' ensemble which is a kind of real symmetric matrix ensemble , asymptotically approaches to the semicircle , i.e .",
    ", @xmath0 porter and rosenzweig also found that the level density of some special random matrices satisfy semi - circle law @xcite@xcite .",
    "wigner s movitation arose from the consideration of properties of wave functions of quantum mechanical system that are extremely complicated that statistical considerations can be applied to them . from a computational point of view ,",
    "random matrix theory , as a statistical theory , is very important to describe extremely complicated quantum mechanical systems such as large atoms , qcd physics(see @xcite for review ) .",
    "it is instructive to continue to work on the properties of rmt in the problems of complicated quantum systems .",
    "recently there has been work on the analysis of top eigenvalues of random matrices(@xcite).when we evaluate some quantities , for example the ratio of the expectation of the largest square of eigenvalues and the expectation of the square of an arbitrary eigenvalues @xmath1 , we can change the integrals into polar coordinates .",
    "we can see the integration on vandermonde space is the difficulty .",
    "therefore it is important to consider the `` fixed trace square ensemble '' on @xmath2 @xmath3 on the @xmath4 dimensional unit sphere @xmath5 and where @xmath6 is a normalization constant .",
    "stieltjes in 1914 proved a theorem that states the maximum value of vandermonde polynomial @xmath7 in the ball @xmath8 achieves its maximal values at zeros of hermite polynomials . in @xcite ,",
    "the author considered the bounded trace square ensemble and obtained semicircle law of bounded trace square ensemble . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors reobtained the semicircle law of fixed trace square ensemble by comparing it with gue and saddle point method . in the present paper",
    ", we would like to give a simple proof of the semicircle law of fixed square ensemble .",
    "let s give a general definition of the ensemble on a homogeneous space .",
    "@xmath9 is a probability distribution satisfying on a homogenous space @xmath10 with respect to the permutation group action on @xmath11 , which are the local coordinates .",
    "the level density is defined to be @xmath12    in this paper , we are concerned with the case that @xmath10 is the @xmath4 dimensional sphere .",
    "we would like to compute the level density of the ensemble @xmath13 on the @xmath14 dimensional ball @xmath15 .",
    "the level density on sphere will easily follow .",
    "we will use selberg s integral @xcite .",
    "( selberg ) for any positive integer @xmath16 , let @xmath17 ,    @xmath18    and @xmath19 then @xmath20 and for @xmath21 , @xmath22 valid for integer @xmath16 and complex @xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25 with @xmath26    we need to compute the constant in the expression of the ensemble .",
    "we can not directly apply selberg s theorem , because the domain we integrate on is the unit ball instead of @xmath2 . by the virtue of gamma function",
    ", we can change the integral on the unit ball to the integral on @xmath2 of selberg s type .",
    "let us prove the following identity first .    for any @xmath27 , we have @xmath28    in selberg s integral , letting @xmath29@xcite and @xmath30,then @xmath31 multiplying @xmath32 to ( [ 114])and integrating with respect to @xmath33 , we get @xmath34 we change variables by @xmath35 . the determinant is @xmath36 where @xmath37,@xmath38 are the radius coordinates in the polar coordinate system .",
    "therefore we have @xmath39 then we end up with @xmath40 now set @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we get @xmath43[1.21 ] by rescaling , we conclude the result of this proposition .",
    "we are now ready to prove the following identity .",
    "the level density of @xmath44 in the unit ball is    the level density of @xmath45 is @xmath46    one can easily apply aomoto s technique ( @xcite ) to compute @xmath47 . however , we wish that we could get an analytic expression of the level density . unfortunately ,",
    "as wee have seen the above theorem , we have to explicitly write expectations such as @xmath48 which turns out to be very hard and remains an open problem .",
    "this fact makes us have to think about the numerical solution of the level density .",
    "we would like to derive the integral equation of the level density of fixed trace square ensemble in another way .",
    "the idea is this . consider the level density of gue . on the sphere with radius @xmath49 , the level density is @xmath50 with weight @xmath51 where @xmath52",
    "so we have    the level density of fixed trace square ensemble satisfies the integral equation @xmath53    for any @xmath54 , we change the following integral into polar coordinate sytem .",
    "@xmath55 the constant in ( [ 3.3 ] ) is computed by proposition 1 .    similarly , we can derive the integral equation of two point cluster function of fixed trace square ensemble @xmath56 in terms of the cluster function of gue @xmath57 .",
    "it immediately follows that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath58 .",
    "it is well known that the eigenvalue distribution of gue , @xmath60 goes to semicircle : @xmath61    it is possible to prove the asymptotic behavior of the integral equation ( [ 124 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the normalized eigenvalue distribution of fixed trace square ensemble @xmath62 goes to the semicircle ( [ semicircle ] ) .",
    "define a function @xmath65 note that @xmath66 is a continuous function on @xmath67 .",
    "then @xmath68(at @xmath69 , this function is defined to be zero ) is also a continuous function . since @xmath70(@xcite ) as @xmath71 , then                                        aomoto k. , jacobi polynomials associated with selberg integrals , siam j. math .",
