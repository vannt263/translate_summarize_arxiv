    "+ * step 2 : * let @xmath460 denote the set of _ integral multi - curves _ on @xmath31 . since @xmath461 is a lattice in @xmath417 ,",
    "the family of measures defined by @xmath462 approximates the thurston measure @xmath463 as @xmath414 tends to infinity .",
    "the fact that @xmath464 means that @xmath465 is a bounded family and that any weak limit @xmath466 , with respect to some sequence of increasing indices @xmath467 , must be absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath463 .",
    "since @xmath466 and @xmath463 are both mapping class group invariant , and @xmath50 acts ergodically on @xmath417 , the radon - nikodym derivative @xmath468 must be equal to some constant @xmath469 .",
    "thus : @xmath470 we finish showing that @xmath471 is independent of @xmath472 . +",
    "* step 3 : * just as @xmath473):=\\mu_{\\mathrm{th}}(b_{[x , f]})$ ] defines a real function on @xmath52 , we can define the following functions @xmath474):=\\mu_{l,\\gamma}(b_{[x , f]})\\text { and } b_{{\\mathbf{l}},\\gamma}([x]):=\\mu_{{\\mathbf{l}},\\gamma}(b_{[x , f]}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating @xmath475 over the moduli space @xmath52 , we obtain : @xmath476)\\ ; \\omega_{s,{\\mathbf{b } } } & = \\int_{\\mathcal{m}(s,{\\mathbf{b}})}\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}b_{l_i,\\gamma}([x])\\;\\omega_{s,{\\mathbf{b}}}\\\\ \\rightarrow   c_{\\mathbf{l}}\\cdot \\int_{\\mathcal{m}(s,{\\mathbf{b } } ) } b([x])\\ ; \\omega_{s,{\\mathbf{b } } } & = \\lim_{l\\to\\infty}\\int_{\\mathcal{m}(s,{\\mathbf{b}})}\\frac{s_x(l,\\gamma)}{l^{6g-6 + 2n}}\\;\\omega_{s,{\\mathbf{b}}}\\\\ \\rightarrow c_{\\mathbf{l } } & = \\frac{c(\\gamma)}{b(s)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see therefore that @xmath471 is @xmath472-independent , and @xmath477 evaluating on @xmath424}$ ] yields equation  .",
    "we first note that the collection of simple closed geodesics on @xmath31 decomposes as a finite disjoint union of mapping class group orbits @xmath478 and the asymptotic growth rate of the number @xmath479 of simple closed geodesics on @xmath56 of length less than @xmath414 is given by : @xmath480)}{b(s)}\\cdot\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^k c(\\gamma_i)\\right ) l^{\\mathrm{dim}_{\\mathbb{r}}\\mathcal{ml}(s)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , mirzakhani s proof applies to rational multicurves in general and not just to simple closed geodesics .",
    "mirzakhani asserts that equation   holds for closed curves in general .",
    "one possible way to prove this might be to use trace relations or hyperbolic trigonometry to show that when the length of a closed curve @xmath481 on a marked hyperbolic surface @xmath37 $ ] is long , it is roughly `` linear '' in the lengths of certain disjoint simple closed geodesics @xmath482",
    ". then , the asymptotic growth rate for @xmath75 is given by the growth rate of a specific multi - curve built from these @xmath482 .",
    "in fact , this idea applies rather easily to let us obtain asymptotic growth rates of orthogeodesics ( and related geometric objects ) .",
    "more importantly , mirzakhani also claims that holds for _ geodesic currents _  a far - reachingly general class of limiting objects built from closed geodesics in much the same way that measured geodesic laminations are built from simple closed curves  with potential applications in studying the length spectrum growth rates for non - positively curved surfaces and hitchin representations or perhaps the growth rate of geometric intersection numbers of pairs of closed curves  etc .    as a final remark ,",
    "it is curious to note that polynomial growth rates do not ( always ) hold in the non - orientable context .",
