    "on first sight , @xmath0dimensional gravity seems to be rather boring . in 3 dimensions ( 3d )",
    ", the weyl tensor vanishes and the curvature is fully determined by the ricci tensor and thus , via the einstein equation , by the energy - momentum alone . outside the sources the curvature is zero and there are no propagating degrees of freedom , i.e. , no gravitational waves .",
    "moreover , there is no newtonian limit .",
    "but even if spacetime is flat , it is not trivial globally .",
    "a point particle , e.g. , generates the spacetime geometry of a cone .",
    "in such a geometry we have light bending , double images , etc .",
    "the spacetimes for n particles can be constructed similarly by gluing together patches of @xmath0d minkowski space .",
    "this was occasionally investigated since the late 1950s , see deser et al . @xcite and the review of carlip @xcite .",
    "some problems in @xmath1d gravity reduce to an effective ( @xmath2)d theory , like the cosmic string , e.g. ; the high  temperature behavior of ( @xmath3)d theories also motivates the study of @xmath0d theories . in this context , deser , jackiw , and tempelton ( djt ) proposed a @xmath0d gravitational gauge model with topologically generated mass @xcite .",
    "however , the real push for @xmath0d gravitational models came when witten formulated the @xmath0d einstein theory as a chern  simons theory , in a similar way as proposed by achcarro and townsend @xcite , and showed its exact solvability in terms of a finite number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "also de sitter gravity , conformal gravity , and supergravity , in @xmath0d , turn out to be equivalent to chern ",
    "simons theories @xcite , see also the recent monograph of blagojevi @xcite .",
    "mielke and baekler ( mb ) proposed a @xmath0d topological gauge model with torsion and curvature @xcite from which the djt  model can be derived by imposing the constraint of vanishing torsion by means of a lagrange multiplier term .",
    "gravitational theories in @xmath0d with torsion , see also tresguerres @xcite and kawai @xcite , are analogous to the continuum theory of lattice defects in crystal physics , in particular , the corresponding theory of dislocations relates to a torsion of the underlying continuum , see krner @xcite , kleinert @xcite , dereli and verin @xcite , katanaev and volovich @xcite , and kohler @xcite .",
    "the fresh approach of lazar @xcite promises additional insight .",
    "the next important impact on @xmath0d gravity was the discovery of a black hole solution by baados , teitelboim , and zanelli ( btz ) @xcite .",
    "the btz black hole is locally isometric to anti - de  sitter ( ads ) spacetime .",
    "it can be obtained , see brill @xcite , from the ads spacetime as a quotient of the latter with the group of finite isometries .",
    "it is asymptotically anti ",
    "de sitter and has no curvature singularity at the origin . nevertheless , it is clearly a black hole : it has an event horizon and , in the rotating case , an inner horizon .",
    "also electrically and magnetically charged generalizations are known . for extensive discussions",
    "see the reviews @xcite .",
    "the relevance to @xmath1d gravity can also be seen from the fact that the btz solution can be derived from the @xmath1d plebaski ",
    "carter metric by means of a dimensional reduction procedure , see cataldo et al .",
    "@xcite . by means of the btz solution ,",
    "many interesting questions can be addressed in the context of quantum gravity .",
    "for example , strominger computed the entropy of the btz black hole microscopically @xcite .",
    "there is also a relationship between the btz black hole and string theory , see hemming and keski",
    " vakkuri @xcite .    thus ,",
    "although @xmath0d gravity lacks many important features of real , @xmath1d gravity , it keeps enough characteristic structure to be of interest , especially in view of the fact that in the @xmath0d case many calculations can be done which are far too involved in @xmath1d for the time being .    in this paper",
    "we show that the btz - metric can be embedded in the framework of the specific poincar gauge model proposed by mielke and baekler .",
    "we arrive at a `` btz - solution with torsion '' , see table 1 , and discuss some of its characteristic properties.    in section ii , we introduce briefly the mb  model and its field equations . in vacuum , these yield constant torsion and constant curvature and , by a suitable ansatz , we obtain the new solution displayed in table 1 . in section iii , we discuss some of the properties of our new solution",
    ". in particular , we compute its quasi ",
    "local energy and angular momentum expressions as it was suggested to us by nester , chen , tung , and wu @xcite .    in section",
    "iv we derive the general conformally flat vacuum solution and show its relation to the solution of table 1 . in the final section v ,",
    "we point out that cartan s spiral staircase , an example of a simple non ",

    "we can derive the deser - jackiw - tempelton ( djt ) model of topological massive gravity @xcite by adding a lagrange multiplier term @xmath31 to the lagrangian @xmath32 thereby enforcing _ vanishing torsion_. quite recently , blagojevi and vasili @xcite considered a restricted mb - model with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath27 , which yields , in vacuum , the field equation @xmath35 , i.e. , _ vanishing curvature _ , introducing thereby the teleparallel geometry of empty spacetime dynamically .",
    "a similar teleparallel model ( including torsion square terms ) was developed by sousa and maluf @xcite .",
    "we find the field equations by variation of ( [ mblag ] ) with respect to coframe and ( lorentz ) connection : @xmath36 the 2-forms of the material energy - momentum and spin currents are defined by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",

    "moreover , we introduced an effective cosmological constant @xmath55 , see table 1 . by means of the coordinate transformation @xmath56 and @xmath57 and some change in notation ,",
    "we arrive at our new btz - like solution with torsion , see table 1 for its explicit form .",
    "the topological terms in the lagrangian will induce an effective cosmological constant even if the ` bare ' cosmological constant @xmath58 vanishes .",

    "autoparallels and extremals coincide and we get the same geodesics as in the case of the standard btz  solution in riemannian spacetime .      in a riemann - cartan space",
