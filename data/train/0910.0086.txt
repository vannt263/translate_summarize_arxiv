    "the study of the isospin degree of freedom in nuclear physics has recently attracted much attention due to the establishment of many radioactive beam facilities around the world . besides the many existing radioactive beam facilities and their upgrades , such as the cooling storage ring ( csr ) facility at hirfl in china @xcite , many more are being constructed or under planning , including the radioactive ion beam ( rib ) factory at riken in japan @xcite , the fair / gsi in germany @xcite , spiral2/ganil in france @xcite , and the facility for rare isotope beams ( frib ) in the usa @xcite .",
    "these new facilities offer the possibility to study the properties of nuclear matter or nuclei under the extreme condition of large isospin asymmetry .",
    "the ultimate goal of such study is to extract information on the isospin dependence of in - medium nuclear effective interactions as well as the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , particularly its isospin - dependent term or the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "this knowledge , especially the latter , is important for understanding not only the structure of radioactive nuclei , the reaction dynamics induced by rare isotopes , and the liquid - gas phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter , but also many critical issues in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the eos of nuclear matter is one of fundamental questions in nuclear physics . for symmetric nuclear matter ,",
    "the eos  is relatively well - determined after about more than @xmath10 years of studies in the nuclear physics community .",
    "the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter at its saturation density @xmath5 has been determined to be @xmath11 mev from the nuclear giant monopole resonances ( gmr ) you99,shl06,lit07,gar07,col09 and the eos at densities of @xmath12 has also been constrained by measurements of collective flows in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite and of subthreshold kaon production @xcite in relativistic nucleus  nucleus collisions . on the other hand , for asymmetric nuclear matter , the eos , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , is largely unknown .",
    "although the nuclear symmetry energy at @xmath5 is known to be around @xmath13 mev from the empirical liquid - drop mass formula @xcite , its values at other densities are poorly known @xcite .",
    "various microscopic and phenomenological models , such as the relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) ulr97,fuc04,ma04,sam05a , fuc05,fuc05b , ron06 and the non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) @xcite approach , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model based on nucleon - meson interactions ren02,bar05,men06,che07 , and the non - relativistic mean - field model based on skyrme - like interactions das03,liba04a , liba04c , che04,riz04,beh05,riz05,che05b , have been used to study the isospin - dependent properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , such as the nuclear symmetry energy , the nuclear symmetry potential , the isospin - splitting of nucleon effective mass , etc . , but the predicted results vary widely .",
    "in fact , even the sign of the symmetry energy above @xmath14 is uncertain @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the isospin dependence of in - medium nuclear effective interactions and the limitations in the techniques for solving the nuclear many - body problem .    in the present work ,",
    "we construct a phenomenological momentum - independent ( mid ) model which can reasonably describe the general properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy predicted by both the sophisticated isospin and momentum dependent mdi model and the skyrme - hartree - fock approach with different skyrme forces .",
    "in particular , the density functional of the symmetry energy constructed in the mid model is shown to be very flexible and can mimic very different density behaviors by varying only one parameter .",
    "we find that there exists a nicely linear correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well as between @xmath15 and @xmath4 , where @xmath2 and @xmath1 represent , respectively , the slope and curvature parameters of the symmetry energy at the normal nuclear density @xmath5 while @xmath4 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the incompressibility and the third - order derivative parameter of symmetric nuclear matter at @xmath5 .",
    "these correlations together with the empirical constraints on @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath16 lead to an estimate of @xmath8 mev @xmath17 mev for the second - order isospin asymmetry expansion coefficient for the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter at the saturation point , which is presently largely uncertain and being heavily discussed  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] , we discuss general properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , and then introduce the momentum independent mid model . the results and discussions are presented in section [ results ] . a summary",
    "is then given in section [ summary ] .",
    "the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , given by its binding energy per nucleon , can be expanded to @xmath18nd - order in isospin asymmetry @xmath19 as @xmath20where @xmath21 is the baryon density with @xmath22 and @xmath23 denoting the neutron and proton densities , respectively ; @xmath24 is the isospin asymmetry ; @xmath25 is the binding energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter , and the nuclear symmetry energy is expressed as @xmath26the absence of odd - order terms in @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eosanm ] ) is due to the exchange symmetry between protons and neutrons in nuclear matter when one neglects the coulomb interaction and assumes the charge symmetry of nuclear forces .",
    "the higher - order coefficients in @xmath19 are usually very small and negligible , e.g. , the magnitude of the @xmath27 term at normal nuclear density @xmath5 is estimated to be less than @xmath28 mev in microscopic many - body approaches @xcite . neglecting the contribution from higher - order terms in eq .",
    "( [ eosanm ] ) leads to the well - known empirical parabolic law for the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter , which has been verified by all many - body theories to date , at least for densities up to moderate values @xcite . as a good approximation",

    "@xmath36 is the binding energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter at the saturation density @xmath5 and the other coefficients can be calculated as    @xmath37    obviously , there is no linear @xmath34 term in eq .",
    "( [ e0 ] ) according to the definition of the saturation density @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath4 is the incompressibility coefficient of symmetric nuclear matter and it characterizes the curvature of @xmath31 at @xmath38 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath6 corresponds to the third - order derivative parameter of symmetric nuclear matter at @xmath5 . in the literature",

    "( [ e0 ] ) and obtain the following parabolic approximation to the eos  of symmetric nuclear matter:@xmath39    similarly , around @xmath5 , the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath29  can be expanded , e.g. , up to @xmath18nd - order in density as @xmath40where @xmath2 and @xmath1 are the slope parameter and curvature parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy at @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath41the coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath1 characterize the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy around normal nuclear density @xmath5 , and thus carry important information on the properties of nuclear symmetry energy at both high and low densities .",
    "the incompressibility is an essential quantity for nuclear matter and conventionally it is defined at the saturation density @xmath42 for asymmetric nuclear matter where we have @xmath43 ( the incompressibility coefficient at the saturation density is called isobaric incompressibility coefficient in @xcite ) and thus it can be expressed as @xmath44for asymmetric nuclear matter , the isobaric incompressibility coefficient @xmath45 can be expressed up to @xmath18nd - order in @xmath19 as  @xcite    @xmath46    with@xmath47the coefficient @xmath48 essentially reflects the isospin dependence of the isobaric incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "if we use the parabolic approximation to eos of symmetric nuclear matter , i.e. ,  eq .",
    "( [ e0para ] ) , then the @xmath48 is reduced to @xmath49and this expression has been extensively used to characterize the isospin dependence of the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter in the literature  @xcite .",
    "obviously , we have    @xmath50    and thus the coefficient @xmath51 could be a good approximation to @xmath48 if @xmath6 is negligible or the slope parameter of the symmetry energy @xmath2 is very small .",
    "it is believed that information on @xmath48 can in principle be extracted experimentally by measuring the gmr in neutron - rich nuclei  bla80 .",
    "usually , one can define a finite nucleus incompressibility @xmath52 for a nucleus with @xmath53 neutrons and @xmath54 protons ( @xmath55 ) by the energy of gmr @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57where @xmath58 is the nucleon mass and @xmath59 is the mean square mass radius of the nucleus at ground state .",
    "similar to the semi - empirical mass formula , the finite nucleus incompressibility @xmath60 can be expanded as@xmath61where @xmath4 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 represent the volume , surface , symmetry , and coulomb terms , respectively .",
    "the @xmath63 parameter is usually thought to be equivalent to the @xmath48 parameter .",
    "it should be noted here that the @xmath48 parameter is theoretically a well - defined physical quantity while the value of the @xmath63 parameter may depend on the detailed truncations in the expansion similarly to the semi - empirical mass formula .",
    "earlier attempts based on the above method have given widely different values for the @xmath63 parameter .",
    "for example , a value of @xmath65 mev with a large uncertainty was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from a systematic study of the gmr in the isotopic chains of sn and sm . in this analysis ,",
    "the value of @xmath4 was found to be @xmath66 mev , which is somewhat larger than the commonly accepted value of @xmath11 mev . in a later study ,",
    "an even less stringent constraint of @xmath67 mev was extracted from the gmr of finite nuclei , depending on the mass region of nuclei and the number of parameters used in parameterizing the incompressibility of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "most recently , a much stringent constraint of @xmath68 mev has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from measurements of the isotopic dependence of the gmr in even - a sn isotopes .      in the present work",
    ", we will mainly use three models , i.e. , the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction  @xcite , the hartree - fock approach based on skyrme interactions , and a phenomenological momentum - independent interaction ( mid ) .",
    "the mdi interaction  @xcite is based on the finite - range gogny effective interaction and has been used extensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the shf approach is a well - known mean - field theory and has been extensively used in the literature for its simplicity .",
    "a very useful feature of these models is that analytical expressions for many interesting physical quantities in asymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature can be obtained .",
    "here we only introduce the mid model  and for the mdi and shf models , one can refer to , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the momentum - independent mid model , following the results from shf approach with the zero - range and momentum - independent skyrme interaction , the potential energy density @xmath69 of a cold symmetric nuclear matter at total density @xmath70 and isospin asymmetry @xmath19 is parametrized as @xmath71 in the mid model , the @xmath72th - order and higher - order nuclear symmetry energy are not included and we assume they can be negligible . the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are determined by the binding energy per nucleon @xmath76 mev and the incompressibility @xmath4 at the saturation density @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79where the unit of @xmath4 is mev .",

    "( [ ksat2kasy ] ) , the @xmath51 parameter corresponds to the @xmath48 parameter when @xmath6 is zero , i.e. , the parabolic approximation to the eos of symmetric nuclear matter eq .",
    "( [ e0para ] ) is valid . from the mid model",
    ", a vanishing @xmath6 corresponds to a @xmath4 value of about @xmath179 mev , which is significantly larger than the empirical value of @xmath11 mev . in the mid model",
    ", we have @xmath180 for @xmath181 mev and thus @xmath182 or @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , the difference between @xmath51 and @xmath48 depends on @xmath2 with a larger  @xmath2 value ( stiffer symmetry energy ) leading to larger difference . at this point",
    ", it should be stressed that the @xmath51 parameter is completely determined by the density dependence of the symmetry energy regardless of the eos  of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "based on the ibuu04 transport model analysis on the isospin diffusion data @xcite , a value of @xmath184 mev has been extracted from the symmetry energy obtained by the mdi interaction with the @xmath89 parameter between @xmath93 and @xmath100 .",
    "the constraint @xmath184 mev is quite consistent with the very recent constraint of @xmath185 mev from the study of neutron skin of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the mdi interaction , we have @xmath186 mev @xmath187 mev from the prediction of the mdi interaction with the @xmath89 parameter between @xmath93 and @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , for the mdi interaction , the magnitude of @xmath48 is significantly smaller than that of @xmath51 and is quite insensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "these features indicate that the high - order @xmath6 contribution to @xmath48 generally can not be neglected .",
    "we have constructed a phenomenological momentum - independent mid model which can reasonably describe the general properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy predicted by both the sophisticated isospin and momentum dependent mdi model and the shf approach with different skyrme forces . in particular ,",
    "the density functional of the symmetry energy constructed in the mid model is shown to be very flexible and can mimic very different density behaviors by varying only one parameter .",
    "based on the mid model , we have studied in detail the second - order isospin coefficient @xmath48 which is determined uniquely by @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath15 .",
    "our results indicate that the high - order @xmath6 contribution to @xmath48 generally can not be neglected , especially for larger @xmath2 values .",
    "in addition , interestingly , it is found that there exists a nicely linear correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well as between @xmath15 and @xmath4 for the three different models used here , i.e. , the mdi interaction , the mid interaction , and the shf approach with @xmath127 skyrme forces . from the mid model ,",
    "the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is further shown to depend significantly on the value of @xmath188 .",
    "these correlations and features enable us to extract the values of the @xmath6 parameter and the @xmath1 parameter from the empirical information on @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath188 .",
    "in particular , using the empirical constraints of @xmath163 mev , @xmath136 mev @xmath189 mev ,  and @xmath147 mev @xmath110 mev in the mid model leads to an estimate of @xmath8 mev @xmath190 mev .    while the estimated value of @xmath8 mev @xmath175 mev in the present work has a small overlap with the constraint of @xmath191  mev obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from recent measurements of the isotopic dependence of the gmr in even - a sn isotopes , the magnitude of the constrained @xmath63 is still significantly larger than that of @xmath8 mev @xmath175 mev .",
    "recently , there are several works @xcite on extracting the value of the @xmath48 parameter based on the idea initiated by blaizot and collaborators that the values of both @xmath4 and @xmath48 should be extracted from the same consistent theoretical model that successfully reproduces the experimental gmr energies of a variety of nuclei .",
    "these studies show that there is no a single model ( interaction ) which can simultaneously describe correctly the recent measurements of the isotopic dependence of the gmr in even - a sn isotopes and the gmr data of nuclei @xmath192zr and @xmath114pb , which makes it difficult to accurately determine the value of @xmath48 from the experimental gmr energies of a variety of finite nuclei .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , these features seem to suggest that the @xmath68  mev obtained in ref .",
    "lit07,gar07 may suffer from the same ambiguities already encountered in earlier attempts @xcite to extract the @xmath4 and @xmath48 of infinite matter from finite - nuclei extrapolations .",
