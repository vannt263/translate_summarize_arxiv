    "the barred spiral galaxy ngc4258 , located at a distance of 7.2@xmath00.3 mpc @xcite , presents a well - studied active nuclear region , classified as a seyfert 1.9 , according to @xcite , with a warped sub - parsec keplerian water maser accretion disc surrounding a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "@xcite modelled the maser region as a warped viscous accretion disc that is illuminated obliquely by a central x - ray source , so that the disc heating is dominated by x - ray photons .",
    "they also suggested that the edges of the water maser region are determined by the thermodynamical conditions of the disc ( and this has been corroborated recently by @xcite ) .",
    "low - energy x - rays from the galactic centre are absorbed by a hydrogen column density of approximately @xmath1 @xmath2 , providing indirect evidence that the warped accretion disc is the x - ray absorber in ngc4258 @xcite .",
    "high - resolution interferometric images at radio wavelengths show the presence of a compact jet @xcite , and of two radio spots located at 840 pc south and 1.7 kpc north from the nucleus and identified as bow shock counterparts of the jet - ambient interaction @xcite .",
    "the maser disc , which extends roughly between 0.14 and 0.28 pc in relation to the nucleus @xcite , is counterrotating with respect to the galactic disc of the host galaxy , in which kilo - parsec anomalous arms have been detected at the h@xmath3 transition @xcite and later at radio to x - ray frequencies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed study of the kinematics of the maser spots conducted by @xcite showed a deviation from keplerian motion in their projected rotation curve of about 9 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this deviation was successfully modeled as a keplerian warped accretion disc , with a radial gradient in its inclination of approximately 0.034 mas@xmath4 .",
    "although the existence of a warped accretion disc in ngc4258 seems to be the best explanation for the observational data , the nature of the physical mechanism responsible for producing such a structure has not been unambiguously established .",
    "tidal torques in a massive binary system were proposed by @xcite as being responsible for the disc warping ( in their model , the companion object has a mass comparable to that of the disc ) .",
    "in addition , irradiation - driven torques produced by non - axisymmetric forces due to radiation pressure @xcite were also invoked to explain the observed behaviour . as noted by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "if the accretion disc of ngc4258 is radiatively inefficient @xcite , this mechanism can not produce the inferred warp in ngc4258 , since the disc becomes radiatively unstable far from its maser region .",
    "if the disc is radiatively efficient but the shear acting vertically does not have the same value as the azimuthal shear , the critical radius beyond which the radiative instability acts will increase . for a viscosity parameter",
    "@xmath5 @xcite , the masing disc of ngc4258 is stable against the radiation instability @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze an alternative mechanism that could warp the accretion disc of ngc4258 : the bardeen - petterson effect @xcite , predicted in the framework of general relativity when the spin axis of a kerr black hole is inclined in relation to the angular momentum vector of the disc .",
    "a brief description of the effect is presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we present our accretion disc model , introducing its basic parameters , as well as their values constrained by the observational data of ngc4258 . the bardeen - petterson radius and the alignment time - scale between the accretion disc and the spinning black hole , calculated in terms of the black hole spin and for different disc parameters ,",
    "are presented in section 4 .",
    "the possible connection between the radio jet of ngc4258 and the anomalous arms in the galactic disc is also discussed in section 4 in terms of jet precession due to the bardeen - petterson effect .",
    "general conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "frame dragging produced by a kerr black hole causes precession of a particle if its orbital plane is inclined in relation to the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "this effect , known as lense - thirring precession , has been mainly studied analytically and numerically in the context of quasi - periodic x - ray brightness oscillations in x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "the precession angular velocity @xmath6 due to the lense - thirring effect is given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) :    @xmath7     + where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , @xmath9 is the speed of light , @xmath10 is the distance from the black hole and @xmath11 is the angular momentum of a kerr black hole with mass @xmath12 , which is defined as :    @xmath13     + where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is a dimensionless parameter corresponding to the ratio between the actual angular momentum of the black hole and its maximum possible value .",
    "the alignment between the angular momenta of the kerr black hole and the accretion disc is forced by a combination between the lense - thirring effect and the internal viscosity of the accretion disc .",
    "this is known as the bardeen - petterson effect @xcite and it tends to affect the innermost part of the disc due to the short range of the lense - thirring effect , while the disc s outer part tends to remain in its original configuration .",
    "the transition radius between these two regimes is known as the bardeen - petterson radius @xmath16 and its exact location depends mainly on the physical properties of the accretion disc ( @xcite ) .",
    "basically , the bardeen - petterson radius is determined by comparing the time - scale related to the lense - thirring effect to that of warp transmission through the disc , giving :    @xmath17     + or    @xmath18     + depending on whether the warp propagation occurs diffusively ( @xmath19 ) or through waves ( @xmath20 ) . in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 )",
    ", @xmath21 represents the viscosity along the normal to the accretion disc , and @xmath22 is the sound speed in the disc .",
    "@xcite showed that the transition from the diffusive to wave - like regime occurs at a radius @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the scale - height of the disc and @xmath3 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter introduced by @xcite .",
    "the time - scale for alignment between the angular momenta of the black hole and the accretion disc was first estimated by @xcite , assuming that each mass element accreted by the black hole carries an orbital angular momentum corresponding to that at the bardeen - petterson radius .",
    "@xcite obtained an analytic solution to the equations that control the warp evolution in the case of a disc with constant surface density and calculated the alignment time - scale .",
    "@xcite generalized the results found by @xcite to a power - law viscosity .",
    "these studies suggest that the alignment time - scale can be estimated by :    @xmath25     + where @xmath26 is the angle between the black hole spin axis and the direction perpendicular to the outer part of the warped disc .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath11 has the form :    @xmath27     + where @xmath28 is the angular momentum density of the accretion disc , given by :    @xmath29     + where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the angular velocity and the mass surface density of the accretion disc .",
    "the last quantity is obtained by integrating over the scale - height of the disc :    @xmath32     + where @xmath33 is the mass density of the disc and @xmath34 is the perpendicular distance from the midplane of the disc .",
    "note that the alignment torque depends on an integral that should be performed from the bardeen - petterson radius to the outer radius of the accretion disc .",
    "although the last quantity is not known accurately in many cases ( even in the case of ngc4258 ) , its precise value is not important for our calculations since the alignment torque decreases rapidly with distance for the realistic disc models considered in this work .",
    "the examination of the viability of the bardeen - petterson effect requires some knowledge about the physical characteristics of the accretion disc ( such as its viscosity , surface density and scale - height ) , as well as the mass and spin of the black hole . in this section",
    ", we will present our parametric accretion disc model for ngc4258 , using the available observational data to constrain the values of the parameters .",

    "the minus and plus signs correspond to prograde and retrograde motion , respectively .",

    "the sound speed @xmath22 is given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) :    @xmath47     + where @xmath48 is the politropic index of the gas , which we have taken to be equal to 5/3 , and @xmath49 is the viscosity along the disc :    @xmath50^{-1}\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{r_\\mathrm{ms}}{r}\\right)^2          \\frac{\\omega_\\mathrm{d}(r_\\mathrm{ms})}{\\omega_\\mathrm{d}(r)}\\right ] ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + where @xmath51 is the accretion rate onto the black hole , assumed to be constant along the disc .",

    "we summarize the physical parameters of ngc4258 that will be used to analyze the feasibility of the bardeen - petterson effect in this particular source .",

    "besides the warp in the tilt angle , there is also strong evidence that the maser disc of ngc4258 is twisted azimuthally , in the sense that the position angle in the disc varies with the radial distance from the black hole ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that a variation of about 10@xmath101 in the warp position angle is sufficient to accommodate the observed maser kinematics . assuming that the warping in the position angle is described by the quadratic function given by these authors",
    ", we find a variation of @xmath102 in this quantity from the inner maser radius to the extrapolated value at @xmath103 mas .",
    "interestingly , a disc twisting of about 10@xmath101 is obtained if we consider the variation of the position angle from the core to the highest value of the bardeen - petterson radius calculated in this work .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed that jet precession by an angle of about 10@xmath101 can also reproduce the physical characteristics of the anomalous arms .",

    "the anomalous arms , observed from radio to x - ray wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) , are strongly believed to lie in the galactic disc of ngc4258 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , even though their nature has been related to the jet propagation through the disc in some cases @xcite .",

    "@xcite performed a detailed study of ngc4258 , using high - resolution x - ray observations , correlating these data with radio and optical images obtained in previous works .",
    "they proposed that the anomalous arms are shocked regions produced by the interaction between the disc gas and the mass motions induced by the propagation of the radio jet / counterjet .",
    "in addition , they suggested two different scenarios for the curvature of the anomalous arms : jet precession , also proposed by @xcite , or buoyancy of the less dense and less tightly bound gas in the outer galactic disc .",
    "here we shall assume that the curvature of the outer anomalous arms of ngc4258 is driven by jet precession .",
    "from this assumption , we shall analyze the possibility that this precession is being produced by the bardeen - petterson effect .",
    "the bardeen - petterson effect induces not only a disc alignment but also a precession around the rotation axis of the black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the precession angle @xmath115 as a function of @xmath114 and @xmath110 can be written as :    @xmath116    in order to be able to reproduce the physical characteristics of the anomalous arms , as well as the radio jet , it is necessary for the jet direction to change by @xmath117 @xcite , which implies that @xmath118 .",

    "we note that a time interval between 5 and 300 myr is necessary for the jet to change its direction by ten degrees .",
    "such time - scales seem to be feasible since they are similar to or shorter than the viscous time - scale at 0.14 pc ( between 0.06 and 3 gyr considering all combinations of the disc parameters used here ) .",
    "therefore , the bardeen - petterson effect is an excellent candidate for driving the precession in ngc4258 .",
    "in this work , we have analysed the viability of the bardeen - petterson effect as the mechanism responsible for the warping and precession of the disc of ngc4258 .",
    "evidence for a warped accretion disc in this source comes from the kinematics of the water maser inferred from high - resolution observations @xcite .",

    "this argues for the existence of a bardeen - petterson disc in ngc4258 .",
    "consequently , the observed warping may be interpreted as resulting from a gradient in the disc inclination angle due to the transition from an inner ( flat ) disc and a misaligned outer disc .",
    "all solutions lead to a time - scale for the alignment between the accretion disc within the bardeen - petterson radius and the black hole s equator shorter than about 10 gyr .",
    "the alignment time - scales obtained were generally longer than about 0.4 gyr .    assuming that the time evolution of the precession period follows the results obtained by @xcite , we calculated the time interval necessary for the accretion disc , and consequently for the jet / counterjet , to precess by an angle of ten degrees .",
    "this value is necessary to reproduce the curvature of the outer anomalous arms in the kiloparsec galactic disc of ngc4258 if jet precession is responsible for it .",
    "we found that an interval between 5 and 300 myr can make the jet to change its orientation by the required angle . this time - scale is shorter than the radial viscous time - scale calculated at 0.14 pc ( between 0.06 and 3 gyr , depending on the disc parameters ) , the inner radius of the maser disc .",
    "given the similarity between the value of the jet precession angle and that of the twist of the azimuthal position angle inside the bardeen - petterson region of the disc , we suggest the possibility that both effects are associated with the same physical origin ( frame - dragging by a kerr black hole ) .    we conclude that the bardeen - petterson effect may explain the observations of ngc4258 on both the sub - parsec and kiloparsec scales .",

    "<S> since this structure is similar to that seen in ngc4258 , we propose that the bardeen - petterson effect may be responsible for the disc warping in this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the time - scale necessary for the disc inside of the bardeen - petterson radius to align with the black hole s equator , as a function of the black hole spin . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the bardeen - petterson effect can align the disc within a few billion years in the case of ngc4258 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that if the observed curvature of the outer anomalous arms in the galactic disc of ngc4258 is associated with the precession of its radio jet / counterjet , then the bardeen - petterson effect can provide the required precession period .    </S>",
