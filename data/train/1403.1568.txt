    "<S> this observation has fundamental consequences for our understanding and utilization of isolated quantum systems . </S>",

    "<S> the entanglement difference goes to zero both in the thermal and localized phases . in the thermal phase </S>",
    "<S> , the entanglement difference goes to zero because of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis since the local perturbation only introduces a small uncertainty in the energy of the state . in the localized phase </S>",
    "<S> , the perturbation can not propagate to the middle of the sample in order to generate any entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> note that the perturbation of the exact eigenstate is local and therefore no entanglement is generated from the dephasing mechanism observed in a global quench  @xcite .    around the transition , @xmath39 peaks with a diverging amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this diverging peak might be understood as a consequence of the many - body mobility edge . </S>",
    "<S> namely , after the quench we have a state that is no longer an eigenstate , but rather a linear combination of a number of states with energies around @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> close to the transition this linear combination contains both extended and localized state , and generates extensive entanglement under time evolution . in the case when the initial state is a localized state , this results in an entanglement difference that scales with system size . unlike @xmath40 , </S>",

    "<S> thus , a diverging @xmath39 is suggestive for the existence of a many - body mobility edge . </S>",

    "<S> we conclude that the localization and spin - glass transition are separate transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the dynamical mbl and spin - glass transitions a spectral transition takes place at large disorder strength  @xcite , which unlike the other two transitions can not be directly detected in a single eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> instead it is characterized by each energy in the spectrum becoming doubly degenerate . </S>",

    "<S> the bulk excitations are localized strongly enough that the splitting of the majorana mode is still exponentially small , going like @xmath63 with @xmath64 the localization length . </S>",
    "<S> all states therefore come in pairs that differ only in the occupation of the majorana mode . unlike in the ground state , </S>",
    "<S> the broken @xmath8 symmetry is however not enough to give pairing , since the splitting of the edge modes competes with the mean level spacing , which is also exponentially small in system size but with a prefactor that depends only weakly on disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing transition could therefore be separate from the spin glass transition . </S>",
    "<S> we have clearly observed the pairing transition in our data ( not shown ) but have not been able to perform a reliable finite size scaling analysis of it in order to obtain the transition location . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we could not determine with sufficient accuracy if the spectral transition is separate from the spin - glass transition , though our data suggests that it is .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have explored two promising probes of the many - body localization transition and used them to study the transition in a disordered quantum ising chain as a function of energy density . </S>",
    "<S> these probes are obtained from the entanglement properties of exact eigenstates , namely its standard deviation and its time evolution after a local quench at the edge of an eigenstate . </S>",
