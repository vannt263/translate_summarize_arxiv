    "the study of the interplay of noise and nonlinear dynamics in systems under nonequilibrium conditions has generated wide interdisciplinary interests in the last two decades .",
    "noise or fluctuations , which are normally considered to be an hinderance , are found to play an active constructive role in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "infact , this constructive role of noise ( as opposed to the conventional wisdom of its destructive or its disorganising role ) has become a new paradigm in the study of complex systems . in the so called ratchet systems",
    "the presence of spatial / temporal anisotropy in potential together with nonequilibrium perturbations enable the extraction of useful work from random fluctuations without the violation of the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite . in such systems it is possible to induce directed motion from nonequilibrium fluctuations in the absence of bias .",
    "much of the studies in different classes of ratchet models deal with the nature of currents and their reversals  @xcite , stochastic energetics ( thermodynamic efficiency )  @xcite etc . however , transport of brownian particle is always accompanied by a diffusive spread and this spread is intimately related to the question of reliability or quality of transport . the diffusive spread infact detriments the quality of transport .",
    "there exists very few studies which address the question of diffusion accompanying transport in ratchet systems  @xcite . in our present work",
    "we address this aspect of transport and study the coherence in transport in a frictional ratchet in the presence of an external parametric gaussian white noise fluctuation .",
    "this is infact studied in terms of a dimensionless quantity called the p@xmath0clet number @xmath1 which is the ratio of velocity to the diffusion constant .",
    "higher the @xmath2 , lesser is the diffusive spread and higher is the transport coherence .",
    "infact , subcellular transport in biological systems amidst a noisy environment are modeled based on the principle of ratchet mechanism and the experimental studies on these molecular motors show them to have highly efficient and reliable transport with p@xmath0clet number ranging from 2 to 6  @xcite . a value of @xmath2 greater than @xmath3 corresponds to coherent transport  @xcite .",
    "the p@xmath0clet numbers for some of the models like flashing and rocking ratchets were found to be @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite respectively implying a less reliable transport .",
    "another study on symmetric periodic potentials along with spatially modulated white noise showed a coherent transport with p@xmath0clet number less than @xmath6 . in the same study a special kind of strongly asymmetric potential",
    "is found to increase @xmath2 to @xmath7 in some range of physical parameters  @xcite .",
    "there exists many physical systems like flashing ratchets  @xcite , rocking ratchets  @xcite , time asymmetric ratchets etc . , where different aspects of noise induced transport has been widely studied  @xcite . in the above models , to generate unidirectional current the nonequilibrium fluctuations need to be correlated in time .",
    "there exists a possibility to get unidirectional current even in presence of symmetric ratchet potentials provided it is driven by a time correlated asymmetric force  @xcite . in our present work",
    "we consider yet another class of ratchets , namely the frictional ratchets , where the friction coefficient and subsequently the diffusion coefficient varies in space  @xcite . in these",
    "frictional ratchets it is possible to get unidirectional currents even in a symmetric underlying potential but in presence of an external noise which need not be correlated in time unlike in earlier models .",
    "space dependent diffusion coefficient , @xmath8 , felt by the brownian particle could arise either due to space dependent temperature or space dependent friction coefficient . in the frictional ratchet system which we consider in the present work the unidirectional current arises due to a combination of both space dependent friction coefficient and external parametric white noise .",
    "the temperature of the bath ( or the environment ) of the brownian particle is characterised by a constant temperature @xmath9 . in the presence of external parametric noise the overdamped brownian particle on an average absorbs energy from the external noise source .",
    "the strength of the absorbed energy depends on the local frictional coefficient .",
    "hence the problem of particle motion in an inhomogeneous medium in presence of an external noise becomes equivalent to the problem in a space dependent temperature  @xcite .",
    "such systems are known to generate unidirectional currents .",
    "this follows as a corollary to landauer s blow torch theorem that the notion of stability changes dramatically in the presence of temperature inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "in such cases the notion of local stability , valid in equilibrium systems , does not hold .",
    "frictional inhomogeneities are common in superlattice structures , semiconductors or motion in porous media .",
    "particles moving close to a surface experience space dependent friction  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that molecular motor protiens moving close along the periodic structures of microtubules experience a space dependent friction  @xcite .",
    "frictional inhomogeneity changes the dynamics of the particle nontrivially as compared to the homogeneous case .",
    "this in turn has been shown to give rise to many counter intuitive phenomena like noise induced stability , stochastic resonance , enhancement in efficiency etc . , in driven non - equilibrium systems  @xcite .    in our present work",
    "we show that system inhomogeneities may help in enhancing / degrading the coherence in the transport depending sensitively on the physical parameters .",
    "we emphasize mainly the case where the underlying potential is a simple sinusoidal symmetric potential .",
    "the role of spatial asymmetry in potential is also discussed .",
    "the external noise is found to play a constructive role in enhancing the coherence in transport .",
    "as opposed to this , temperature ( internal fluctuations ) degrades the coherence in transport .",
    "we start with the kramer s equation of motion for a brownian particle of unit mass in contact with a heat bath in a medium with spatially varying friction coefficient @xmath10 at temperature @xmath9 . in addition",
    "an external parametric gaussian white noise fluctuation @xmath11 is also included .",
    "the equation of motion is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the potential seen by the brownian particle and @xmath14 is an internal gausian white noise fluctuation arising from the bath having the property that @xmath15 , and @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the ensemble average and @xmath18 the coordinate of the particle .",

    ", one can in most practical cases consider the overdamped limit of the langevin equation .",
    "this in turn correspond to the adiabatic elimination of the fast variable , velocity , from the equation of motion by putting @xmath23 for a homogeneous system .",
    "in contrast , for the case of inhomogeneous system the above method of elimination does not work and sancho et al .",
