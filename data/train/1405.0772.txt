    "inflation @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) is becoming a standard model for the very early universe .",
    "recent report from bicep2 gives a tensor - to - scalar ratio ( at 1-@xmath0 level ) to be @xcite @xmath1 which seems to prefer a large field inflation model ( which means the field value during inflation is larger than planck scale ) .",
    "one interesting realization of a large field inflation model is natural inflation @xcite where the inflaton field is a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) . recently",
    "a comparison of natural inflation with bicep2 is made in @xcite .",
    "there is also an extra natural inflation @xcite ( see also @xcite for some recent model building ) which is usually regarded as another realization of natural inflation via extra dimensional phenomenon . those models ( both natural and extra natural inflation ) can be distinguished from chaotic inflation @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we point out that the prediction for the running spectral index @xmath2 and the running of running spectrum @xmath3 are different between natural inflation and extra natural inflation .",
    "the observation of those parameters will be improved by future 21 cm data @xcite",
    ". however , the expected accuracy is marginal and we have to wait for further improvement for the data in order to achieve decisive conclusion .",
    "the spectrum generated during inflation is given by the following standard formula ( for simplicity , we set the reduced planck mass @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the inflaton potential and the derivative is with respect to the inflaton field @xmath7 . the simplest way to characterize",
    "the scale dependence of the spectrum is to investigate the spectral index @xmath8 , defined by @xmath9 by using the handy relation , @xmath10 it is easy to show from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) that @xmath11 where the slow - roll parameters are defined as @xmath12 we can define higher order slow - roll parameters as @xmath13 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , the running spectrum is given by @xmath14 the running of running spectrum can also be obtained as @xmath15 usually we have the hierarchy @xmath16 this is also the case for ( extra ) natural inflation .    according to planck data @xcite , @xmath17 ( at 1-@xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath18 at 2-@xmath0 ) and @xmath19 at 2-@xmath0 .",
    "near future measurement of 21 cm fluctuations will improve the accuracy by one or two orders @xcite .",
    "ideally , we would have @xmath20 at 2@xmath0 .",
    "natural inflation assumes the inflaton field is a pseudo nambu goldstone boson ( pngb ) , with the inflaton potential given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the spontaneous symmetry breaking scale . in order for inflation to occur , we need @xmath23 which is outside the range of validity of an effective field theory description .",
    "this motivates the introduction of extra natural inflation ( although other ways to evade the problem exist , such as assisted inflation @xcite , n - flation @xcite , the kim - nilles - peloso mechanism @xcite and the axion monodromy @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of extra natural inflation is that a similar form of the potential can be obtained in the framework of a 5d model with the extra dimension compactified on a circle of radius @xmath24 .",
    "the extra component @xmath25 of an abelian gauge field plays the role of the inflaton and in this case the effective decay constant is given by , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the 5d gauge coupling and @xmath28 is the 4d gauge coupling .",
    "note that the condition @xmath23 can be achieved by a sufficiently small @xmath29 for a @xmath24 larger than planck length . in the case of extra natural inflation ,",
    "the potential is not really given by eq .",
    "( [ natural ] ) , but we should replace it as @xmath30 the potential in eq .",
    "( [ natural ] ) is obtained if we approximate it by choosing only @xmath31 and neglecting other terms which are suppressed by the factor @xmath32 .",
    "this is reasonable if we are calculating slow - roll parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , those higher order terms becomes important when we are calculating higher order slow - roll parameters @xmath0 and @xmath35 .",
    "we now argue why the contributions from larger @xmath8 become important when we consider higher order slow - roll parameters .",
    "we first briefly see the origin of the term @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ extranatural ] ) .",
    "it is nothing but the effective potential in one of the proposals of physics beyond the standard model ,  gauge - higgs unification \" , where higgs is identified with the extra - space component of higher - dimensional gauge field @xmath25 @xcite . in the simplest case of 5-dimensional space - time",
    ", the higgs is not allowed to have potential at the classical level , just because gauge field itself is gauge - variant quantity and its polynomials are forbidden by the local gauge symmetry of the theory . at the quantum level",
    ", however , concrete calculation shows that the potential such as the one mentioned above , @xmath36 , is induced , where @xmath37 with @xmath24 being the size of the extra space , and we can even discuss the spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the vev of that higgs field . to be strict , the potential is due to the quantum effects of particles with zero bulk mass ( higher dimensional mass ) .    at the first glance ,",
    "this situation is a little strange , since the vev , i.e. a constant gauge field ( recall that higgs is originally a gauge field ) is equivalent to vanishing ",
    "electro - magnetic \" fields ( though the gauge symmetry needs not to be u(1)@xmath38 ) and therefore is just a  pure gauge \" configuration . as the matter of fact",
    ", the constant field has physical meaning as a sort of aharonov - bohm ( ab ) phase or wilson - loop phase when the extra space is non - simply connected space , such as the circle @xmath39 .",
    "namely , it may be interpreted as the measure of  magnetic \" flux penetrating inside the circle .",
    "as far as the higgs field is understood as a ab - phase , every observables are expected to be periodic in the field .",
    "that is why trigonometric functions appear in the effective potential ( [ extranatural ] ) .",
    "in fact , we realize @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes how many times the loop of the feynman diagram is wrapped along the circle @xmath39 .",
    "namely , @xmath8 is  winding number \" rather than the integer to denote kaluza - klein modes , which appears after the technique of  poisson resummation \" is used .",
    "being wrapped @xmath8 times , the particles propagating along the loop will  feel \" ab phase @xmath8 times .",
    "now we realize some peculiar features of the potential ( [ extranatural ] ) . if we perform taylor - expansion of the potential at the origin @xmath42 , the coefficients of the higher order terms are all divergent . for instance , @xmath43 which is clearly a divergent sum .",
    "the divergence appears at the fourth - derivative for the first time and becomes more serious as the order of the derivative increases .",
    "such feature is not shared by natural inflation scenario and is specific to extra natural inflation .",
    "the physical interpretation of the origin of the divergence is rather simple ; it is a sort of infra - red ( ir ) divergence coming from the fact that the particle contributing to the quantum effect is massless in the higher - dimensional sense .",
    "in fact , the fourth derivative discussed above corresponds to the 4-point function of higgs field , which is obtained from a feynman diagram with 4 propagators of massless fermion , e.g. , and the integral over the  loop - momentum \" @xmath44 gives divergence at the vicinity of small 4-momentum for the kaluza - klein zero mode : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is uv - cutoff , though uv - divergence eventually does not appear in the gauge - higgs unification after the the contributions from all non - zero kaluza - klein modes are summed up @xcite .",
    "now , it is easily understood that once we add bulk masses to the particles contributing to the quantum correction , such ir divergences can be avoided .",
    "we note that the gauge fields are not allowed to have bulk masses , though .",
    "actually , such ir divergences turn out not to appear even for the case of vanishing bulk mass , once we avoid the origin , namely if we perform taylor - expansion around some non - vanishing value of the field @xmath7 .",
    "this is because the non - vanishing field @xmath7 itself behaves as vev of the higgs , providing non - vanishing 4-dimensional mass for the particles inside the loop . as a typical example the fourth derivative now behaves as @xmath47 ,   \\label{fourth}\\ ] ] which becomes logarithmically divergent as @xmath48 , which is nothing but the ir singularity we discussed above . in ( [ fourth ] ) , a formula @xmath49   \\label{fourier}\\ ] ] has been used @xcite .",
    "we easily find that all derivatives of the potential are ir - finite , since higher derivatives obtained by taking derivatives of ( [ fourth ] ) successively should be all finite for @xmath50 .",
    "we thus conclude that for non - vanishing @xmath7 , relevant for the inflation scenario , all higher derivatives are obtained as finite values .",
    "we at the same time point out that when @xmath51 there appears a tendency that higher derivatives become significant .",
    "in the following , we will analyze ( extra ) natural inflation in detail . to our knowledge , this detailed analytical calculation for extra natural inflation is done for the first time .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ natural ] ) to calculate @xmath52 and @xmath53 since the higher order terms @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ extranatural ] ) are suppressed .",
    "however , for @xmath55 and higher derivative terms we shall use eq .",
    "( [ extranatural ] ) for extra natural inflation .",
    "it is interesting to find that this strategy allows us to carry out the calculation in a ( rather elegant ) analytical way .",
    "the slow roll parameters are given by @xmath56 it is therefore clear that @xmath33 is larger than @xmath34 and inflation ends when @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the field value at the end of inflation .",
    "this gives @xmath59 the spectral index is given by @xmath60 the number of e - folds is @xmath61 therefore @xmath62 this allows us to calculate @xmath8 and @xmath33 as a function of @xmath22 when we fix @xmath63 and we will use @xmath64 .    for natural inflation , we have @xmath65 on the other hand , for extra natural inflation , we have @xmath66 where we have used the fourier series @xcite @xmath67 we keep only the first two terms because @xmath68",
    ". we can hence calculate the higher order slow roll parameter @xmath69 . for natural inflation",
    ", we have @xmath70 for extra natural inflation , we have @xmath71 finally , for natural inflation , we have @xmath72 for extra natural inflation , @xmath73,\\ ] ] where we have used eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) .",
    "this allows us to calculate the higher order slow roll parameter @xmath0 as @xmath74    we can now make plots to show our results .",
    "firstly , the spectral index @xmath8 is shown in fig .",
    "the plot shows we should consider @xmath75 and for large @xmath22 , the spectral index approaches @xmath76 which coincides with quadratic chaotic inflation .     as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath8 becomes the same as ( quadratic ) chaotic inflation for large @xmath77.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we plot the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath78 in fig .",
    "this shows large @xmath22 corresponds to higher inflation scale .",
    "this result can be compared with experiments such as bicep2 .     as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath79 becomes the same as chaotic inflation for large @xmath77 .",
    "this result can be compared with bicep2 and future measurement of primordial gravity waves.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the running spectral index @xmath2 for natural inflation is plotted in fig .  [ fig3 ] and @xmath2 for extra natural inflation is plotted in fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ future ] ) , we can see that it may be possible to distinguish between extra natural inflation and natural inflation if we have @xmath80 .",
    "however , a conclusive result still have to be confirmed if experimental accuracy can be improved further .     as a function of @xmath22 for natural inflation , scaledwidth=60.0% ]     as a function of @xmath22 for extra natural inflation , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the running of running spectrum @xmath3 for natural inflation",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and that for extra natural inflation is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . as we can see from the plots , in order to distinguish those two cases , we need at least @xmath81 which may not be available in the near future . on the other hand , it is interesting to note that the predicted @xmath3 for extra natural inflation is not too large to be inconsistent with current experimental data , albeit the `` ir divergences '' of the fourth derivative near the bottom of the potential described in section [ ir ] .     as a function of @xmath22 for natural inflation.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]     as a function of @xmath22 for extra natural inflation.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "due to recent report of bicep2 , there is a trend to revive large field inflation models .",
    "it is thus an important task to find methods ( if there is any ) to distinguish among those models .    in this paper , we present an analysis for ( extra ) natural inflation .",
    "we found the prediction of those two models for the running spectral index @xmath2 and the running of running spectrum @xmath3 are different .",
    "future experiments of 21 cm fluctuation can give precise measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "in particular the running spectral index @xmath2 will provide us a marginal accuracy for distinguishing between extra natural inflation and natural inflation .",
    "further improvement of accuracy is needed to obtain a conclusive result .",
