    "solving the quark and lepton mass hierarchy problem is one of the most important subject in the elementary particle physics .",
    "many mechanisms for the mass hierarchy have already been proposed .",
    "for example , in the @xmath0 grand unified theory the mass splitting between the bottom quark and the tau lepton can naturally be explained by the unification of their yukawa couplings and scale dependence governed by the renormalization group equation . in the extended technicolor theory the generation of the mass hierarchy",
    "is expected as a result of the dynamics of the strong coupling chiral gauge theory .",
    "considering the compositeness of quarks and leptons is one of the attempt to solve the mass hierarchy problem .",
    "especially the supersymmetric composite model is attractive , since we can naturally have tightly - bounded states whose masses are much smaller than their compositeness scales .",
    "this fact is suggested by experiments .",
    "several interesting mechanisms for the mass hierarchy in the supersymmetric composite model have already been proposed .",
    "having the mass hierarchy by the interplay between the chiral symmetry and the supersymmetry is proposed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the power of the ratio of different energy scales can give the mass hierarchy@xcite .",
    "almost all recent attempts to have the mass hierarchy in the supersymmetric composite model are based on the existence of hierarchical energy scales .",
    "many models are constructed in which hierarchical yukawa couplings are generated as the ratios of different energy scales . in these models",
    "we usually have to prepare many different energy scales and assume some non - renormalizable interactions in the lagrangian at tree level . in this paper",
    "we propose a mechanism which is not based on the hierarchical energy scales .",
    "the basic idea is simple .",
    "we assume the kinetic - term mixing among quarks like @xmath1 the large mixing , @xmath2 , can be obtained , if quarks are composite particles@xcite , and the texture of the mixing can be understood as a result of the dynamics of compositeness .",
    "this kinetic - term mixing is a source of the generation symmetry violation .",
    "furthermore , we assume the interactions which are peculiar to each generation .",
    "for example , to be concrete , we consider three gauged @xmath3 interactions in each generation , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the baryon and lepton numbers , respectively . to be realistic , these interactions must be spontaneously broken , but we do not assume any hierarchical structure in the energy scales of the breaking and gauge couplings . if the mass of the top quark is generated , the masses of the charm and up quarks are generated thorough the diagrams of fig.[b - l ] .",
    "these masses are obtained as @xmath6 up to the common logarithmic correction , where @xmath7 is the gauge coupling . in case of the strong coupling , @xmath8",
    ", we can have a good hierarchy @xmath9 with @xmath10 . here , the masses of up - type quarks at @xmath11 gev are @xmath12 gev , @xmath13 gev and @xmath14 mev . if @xmath3 gauge interactions are unique and common to each generation , the one - loop contribution gives just a correction to the kinetic - term mixing and does not generate mass eigenvalues .    in the following we construct a model in which the above situation ( but not the gauged @xmath3 ) is realized to show that the mechanism is possible . although the model is not completely realistic because of some assumptions and unnaturalness , it is worth developing .    in the next section the one - generation ( the third generation ) model with dynamical supersymmetry breaking",
    "is described .",
    "the model is based on the works of refs.@xcite . in section [ sec : three ] the model is extended to the three - generation model by including other two generations .",
    "the dynamics of the compositeness in each three generation are the same , namely the same structure is repeated three times .",
    "but the compositeness scales of each generation are related with each other , since confining forces are expected to be `` unified '' at a certain scale .",
    "the discussion on the origin of the kinetic - term mixing is also given in this section . in section",
    "[ sec : hierarchy ] it is explained how the quark mass hierarchy is realized in the model .",
    "both the up - type and down - type quarks are discussed .",
    "we see that the mechanism which is briefly sketched above actually works in the model . in the last section we conclude by listing up both the satisfactory and unsatisfactory points of the model .",
    "the model of the third generation is constructed in this section .",
    "the difference of the third generation from other two generations is that it strongly couples to the supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "the model described in this section is essentially the same of that is proposed in ref.@xcite , except for the introduction of the right - handed neutrino and the difference of the notation .",
    "two new gauge interactions are introduced in addition to the gauge interactions of the standard model @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath16 hypercolor is introduced as the confining force to have composite particles in the third generation , and the @xmath17 supercolor is introduced to realize the dynamical supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the fundamental particles of the third generation are shown in table [ contents-3 ] , where @xmath3 is a global symmetry .",
    "all the particles in table [ contents-3 ] are singlet under the @xmath17 supercolor . in the following all fields are superfields without special notice .",
    "note that there is no particle which belongs to the high - dimensional representation of gauge groups , and the representation is vector - like under each factor of the gauge group . in this sense ,",
    "the particle contents are simple .",
