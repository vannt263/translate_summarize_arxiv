    "creative telescoping is a staple of symbolic summation .",
    "its main use is to construct recurrence equations that have a prescribed definite sum among their solutions . by using other algorithms applicable to recurrence equations ,",
    "it is then possible to derive interesting facts about the original definite sum , such as closed forms or asymptotic expansions .    the computational problem of creative telescoping is to construct , for a given term @xmath0 , polynomials @xmath1 in  @xmath2 only , not all zero , and another term @xmath3 s.t . @xmath4 the number @xmath5 may or may not be part of the input",
    ".    we can distinguish four generations of creative telescoping algorithms .",
    "the first generation was based on elimination techniques  @xcite .",
    "the second generation started with what is now known as zeilberger s",
    "algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the algorithms of this generation use the idea of augmenting an algorithm for indefinite summation ( or integration ) by additional parameters @xmath1 that are carried along during the calculation and are finally instantiated , if at all possible , such as to ensure the existence of a term  @xmath6 as needed for the right - hand side .",
    "see @xcite for details about the first two generations .",
    "the third generation was initiated by apagodu and zeilberger  @xcite . in a sense",
    ", they applied a second - generation algorithm by hand to a generic input and worked out the resulting linear system of equations for the parameters  @xmath7 and the coefficients inside the desired term  @xmath6 .",
    "their algorithm then merely consists in solving this system .",
    "this approach is interesting not only because it is easier to implement and tends to run faster than earlier algorithms , but also because it is easy to analyze .",
    "in fact the analysis of algorithms from this family gives rise to the best output size estimates for creative telescoping known so far  @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage is that these algorithms may not always find the smallest possible output .",
    "the fourth generation of creative telescoping algorithms originates from  @xcite . the basic idea behind these algorithms",
    "is to bring each term @xmath8 of the left - hand side into some kind of normal forms modulo all terms that are differences of other terms .",
    "then to find @xmath1 amounts to finding a linear dependence among these normal forms .",
    "the key advantage of this approach is that it separates the computation of the @xmath7 from the computation of  @xmath6 .",
    "this is desirable in the typical situation where we are only interested in the @xmath7 and their size is much smaller than the size of  @xmath6 . with previous algorithms there was no way to obtain  @xmath7 without also computing  @xmath6 , but with fourth generation algorithms there is .",
    "so far this approach has only been worked out for several instances in the differential case  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to give a fourth - generation algorithm for the discrete case , namely for the classical setting of hypergeometric telescoping .",
    "our starting point is the abramov - petkovek reduction for hypergeometric terms introduced in  @xcite and summarized in section  [ sect : apreduction ] below .",
    "unfortunately the reduced forms obtained by this reduction are not sufficiently normal  for our purpose .",
    "therefore , in sections  [ sect : iapreduction ] and  [ sect : sum ] we present a refined variant of the reduction process and show that the corresponding normal forms are well - behaved with respect to taking linear combinations .",
    "then in section  [ sect : tele ] we describe the creative telescoping algorithm obtained from this reduction .",
    "the final section contains an experimental comparison between this algorithm and the built - in algorithm of maple .",
