    "various systems of natural and societal origin show complex behaviour , which can be attributed to competition among interacting agents for scarce resources and their adaptation to continuously changing environment @xcite",
    ". such agents could be diverse in form , function and capability , for example , cells in an immune system or firms in a financial market , so that in the studies one should first focus on the capabilities of individual agents to understand better the nature of interactions between large number of agents .",
    "the behaviour of an agent may be considered as a collection of rules governing _ responses _ to _ stimuli_. in order to model these complex adaptive system , a major concern is the selection and representation of the stimuli and responses , through which the behaviour and strategies of the agents are determined . in a model ,",
    "the rules of action serve as a direct way to describe the strategies of agents , and one studies their behaviour by monitoring the effect of rules acting sequentially . as mentioned above there is another key process to be included to the model , namely _ adaptation _ , which in biology serves as a mechanism by which an organism tries to make itself fit to changing environment but the timescale over which the agents adapt vary from system to system .",
    "what makes these systems fascinatingly complex , is the fact that the environment of a particular agent includes other adaptive agents , all of them competing with each others .",
    "thus , a considerable amount of an agent s effort goes in adaptation and reaction to the other agents .",
    "this feature is the main source of interesting temporal patterns and emergent behaviour these systems produce .",
    "in fact this kind of adaptive systems are far more complicated than systems in which agents just react following some fixed rules of strategy and foresight for outcome as a consequence of their behaviour .",
    "this latter case can be tackled with the traditional game theory @xcite since it studies consistent patterns in behavioural equilibrium that induce no further interactions . in the adaptive case , however , further interactions emerge during the evolution of the system , thus rendering the applicability of the traditional game theory difficult if not impossible .    in this paper",
    ", we will study a simple game model , in which agents adapt dynamically to be competitive and perform better .",
    "in such a model the strategies , which an agent uses to decide the course of action , must be very good or best for the agents to survive  similar to the idea of `` survival of the fittest '' in biology .",
    "so just like an organism adapts itself to its natural environment , we propose that the agents of the game adapt themselves by modifying their strategies from time to time , depending on their current performances . for this purpose",
    "we borrow the concept of genetic crossover from biology and use it to modify the strategies of agents in the course of the game , in the same way as in genetic algorithms @xcite .",
    "more specifically we apply this adaptation scheme to the minority game , introduced by challet and zhang @xcite .",
    "although the behaviour of this minority game is believed to expose a number of important characteristics of complex evolving systems , one of its weaknesses is that agents have limited possibilities in improving to their own performance whereas in real competitive environment attempts to improve ones skills continuously are imperative .",
    "our adaptation scheme @xcite proposes a natural and simple way to take this essential feature into account , and its application turns out to yield results quite different from earlier studies of the basic minority game and its variants @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized such that in the next section we briefly introduce our minority game model together with various adaptation mechanisms or strategy changes based on one - point genetic crossover .",
    "this is followed by the results section , where we first compare comprehensive computer simulation results of these strategies and then focus on analysing results of the model of one - point genetic crossover with offsprings replacing parents , and of hybridized one - point genetic crossover in which the two new strategies replace the two worst strategies .",
    "finally we draw conclusions .",
    "let us start by briefly describing the basic minority game ( bg ) model of challet and zhang @xcite .",
    "it consists of an odd number of agents @xmath0 who can perform only two actions denoted here by @xmath1 or @xmath2 , at a given time @xmath3 .",
    "an agent wins a round of game if it is one of the members of the minority group .",
    "all the agents are assumed to have access to finite amount of `` global '' information , in the form of a common bit - string `` memory '' of the @xmath4 most recent outcomes of the game . with this",
    "there are @xmath5 possible `` history '' bit - strings .",
    "now , a `` strategy '' consists of two possible responses , which in the binary sense are an action @xmath1 or the opposite action @xmath2 to each possible history bit - strings .",
    "thus , there are @xmath6 possible strategies constituting the whole `` strategy space '' @xmath7 , from which each agent picks @xmath8 strategies at random to form its own pool @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes an agent number .",
    "each time the game is played , time @xmath3 is incremented by unity and one `` virtual '' point is assigned to the strategies that have predicted the correct outcome and the best strategy is the one which has the highest virtual point score .",
    "the performance of an agent is measured by the number of times the agent wins , and the strategy , which the agent used to win , gets a `` real '' point .",
    "the number of agents which choose one particular action , changes with time and is denoted by @xmath11 .    in order to describe the collective behaviour of the agents , we define the concept of the scaled utility as a function of @xmath11 , in the following way :    @xmath12/{x_m } , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the maximum number of agents who can win , and    @xmath14    is the heaviside s unit step function .",
    "when @xmath15 or @xmath16 , the scaled utility of the system is maximum @xmath17 , as the highest number of agents win .",
    "the system is more efficient when the deviations from the maximum total utility @xmath18 are small , or in other words , the fluctuations in @xmath11 around the mean ( @xmath19 ) become small .    at the level of individual agents ,",
    "their performances in the basic minority game evolve such that the agents who begin to perform badly do not improve as the time evolves and those who do well , continue doing so @xcite .",
    "this indicates that by chance well performing agents were blessed with good strategies while badly performing agents got bad strategies .",
    "although this is what may happen in some real environments , there are other competitive environments , in which individual agents try to adapt themselves to do better or to survive .",
    "however , being good at one moment does not guarantee that one would stay good later .",
    "in fact , there are many examples in business , sports , etc . which show that those who have decided to rest on their laurels have been superseded by those who have decided to adapt and fight back , and",
    "do so persistently .",
    "this feature of dynamic competition needs to be included in the model , and it can be simply realized by allowing agents to modify strategies in their individual pools .",
    "how well an agent does then in reality , depends on the agent s capabilities and skills , and how the agent refines its strategies . for the adaptation or strategy modification scheme",
    "we have chosen genetic algorithms @xcite , which have turned out to be useful in various optimisation problems . within the framework of the minority game this adaptation scheme",
    "is realised by letting agents check their performances at time interval @xmath20 , and if an agent finds that it is among the worst perfoming fraction @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 ) , it modifies its strategies by applying genetic operands to its strategy pool @xcite . here",
    "the quantity @xmath20 describes a time scale that characterizes the adaptation rate of agents in the system .",
    "hence it can vary on a wide range for systems of natural origin to systems of societal nature .    in the genetic adaptation schemes",
    "we have used in this study , an agent chooses two `` parents '' from its current pool of strategies @xmath23 , and draws a random number ( uniformly distributed ) to determine the crossover point . then the parts of the strategies , above and below this point are interchanged to produce two new strategies called the `` offsprings '' .",
    "in addition to this , there are various choises as for which strategies are selected as the parents and also which strategies are replaced by the reproduced offsprings . the mechanism which works",
    "the best depends on the circumstances and can vary from system to system . in some cases it is possible that saving the parent strategies would threaten the success of the newborn strategies or create too stiff competition amongst the strategies leading to possible disorder , and in other cases the opposite might happen . in this study , we have considered four different adaptation schemes of first selecting from the strategy pool of an agent , the parent strategies to perform genetic crossover for producing offsprings , and then selecting the two old strategies that are to be substituted by the offspring strategies :    \\(a ) two parent strategies from the agent s strategy pool are drawn at _",
    "random _ and after crossover these parents are substituted with the two new strategies ( offsprings ) .",
    "this procedure is called one point genetic ( opg ) crossover mechanism with parents killed .",
    "\\(b ) two parent strategies from the agent s strategy pool are drawn at _",
    "random _ and after crossover the two worst performing strategies in the strategy pool are substituted with the two new strategies ( offsprings ) while the parent strategies are saved .",
    "this procedure is called one point genetic crossover mechanism with parents saved .",
    "\\(c ) two _ best _ strategies are chosen from the agent s strategy pool as parents and after crossover these parents are substituted with the two new strategies ( offsprings ) .",
    "this procedure is called the hybridized genetic ( hg ) crossover mechanism with parents killed .",
    "\\(d ) two _ best _ strategies are drawn from the agent s strategy pool as parents and after crossover the two worst performing strategies in the strategy pool are substituted with the two new strategies ( offsprings ) while the parent strategies are saved .",
    "this procedure is called the hybridized genetic crossover mechanism with parents saved .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there are a number of other adaptation possibilities , but the ones presented here could be considered in a loose sense to bear some resemblance with reality . from the point of view of choosing parents , schemes ( a ) and ( b )  being random  correspond to `` democratic '' or equal opportunity reproduction , while schemes ( c ) and ( d ) are `` elitist '' due to searching best parents and allowing reproduction between them . as for substitutions in the agents strategy pools , in the schemes",
    "( a ) and ( c ) parents give space for their offsprings to live and develop without the need to fight for the limited resources with their parents , a sacrifice for improving the survival of the species .",
    "examples of parents dying after reproduction are numerous in nature . on the other in decision making environments the interpretation of killing the parent strategies is that old strategies - unable to lead into success - are removed to give way to hopefully better strategies .",
    "schemes ( b ) and ( d ) , with parents being saved and agents getting rid of their worst strategies , bear some resemblance with `` natural selection '' of the fittest surviving species . in decision making situations these schemes correspond to agents eradicating their loosing strategies .",
    "thus it is expected that schemes ( b ) and ( d ) lead to tightening competition between agents . furthermore , it could be expected that the scheme ( d ) is the most efficient one , because it removes the worst strategies and replaces them with the crossovers of the best ones , while saving the so far best two strategies in the game . in order to study the effects of stiff competition between agents with continuously improving strategies , in more detail , large scale simulations are needed . in these simulations",
    "it turns out that when agents use genetic operands , the scaled utility of the system increases and tends to maximise with different rates depending on the mechanism and the parameters of the game .    it should be noted that our mechanisms of evolution based on the genetic algorithms are considerably different from the mechanisms applied before within the framework of the minority games @xcite . here ,",
    "the strategies are changed by the agents themselves and they belong to the same strategy space @xmath7 whose size and dimension do not change .",
    "in order to compare the above discussed four genetic adaptation mechanisms , we have first studied the quantity @xmath11 , which describes the number of agents taking a particular action , of the two possible ones , as a function of time .",
    "the results for @xmath24 agents with @xmath25 memories , @xmath26 strategies , and adaptation time @xmath27 for the worst performing fraction @xmath28 of the agents , are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "first in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we present the results of the adaptation scheme ( a ) , i.e. one point genetic crossover between two randomly chosen parent strategies replaced then with the reproduced offsprings . in this case",
    "it turned out that fluctuations in @xmath11 around its mean ( @xmath29 ) decay very rapidly from the initial level , which corresponds to the amount of fluctuations of the basic minority game , to a more or less constant level less than half of the initial level .",
    "this renders our scheme ( a ) game more efficient than the basic minority game .",
    "second in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) we present the results of adaptation scheme ( b ) , i.e. one point genetic crossover between two randomly chosen parent strategies with the reproduced offsprings then replacing the two worst strategies of the agent s pool . in this case we observe that fluctuations in @xmath11 around the mean decay , first rapidly below the value produced by scheme ( a ) and then slower to very small values .",
    "thus the efficiency of the system is further improved .",
    "third in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) we present the results of the adaptation scheme ( c ) , i.e. hybridized genetic crossover mechanism between the best two strategies as parents , replaced after crossover with their offsprings . in this case",
    "fluctuations in @xmath11 around the mean once again decay rapidly then seemingly stabilizing to a level which is smaller than for adaptation scheme ( a ) but larger than for adaptation scheme ( b ) .",
    "fourth in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) we present the results of adaptation scheme ( d ) , i.e. hybridized genetic crossover mechanism between the best two strategies as parents and then the reproduced offsprings replacing the two worst strategies of the agent s pool . in this case",
    "we see that fluctuations in @xmath11 die off very rapidly , thus making the system most efficient .",
    "next we focus our attention to the scaled utility @xmath30 , defined in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , which is expected to give insight not only to the efficiency of the basic minority game and games with different adaptation mechanisms , but also their dynamical behaviour . instead of the standard practice of studying the variation of @xmath31 versus @xmath32 , where @xmath33 stands for the difference in the number of agents between the majority and minority groups , we study the function @xmath34 .",
    "this is because fluctuations in @xmath11 decay strongly for adaptation mechanisms ( b ) and ( d ) , in the latter case sometimes even disappearing completely . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the results of the scaled utility @xmath34 as a function of the scaled time for the four adaptation mechanisms , with the same set of paramaters as before ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ) , such that panel ( a ) is presented in the linear scale and panel ( b ) @xmath35 in the log - log scale to see differences better .",
    "we find that the scaled utility rapidly saturates for the basic minority game , at a value which is considerably less than the maximum that can be achieved .",
    "on the other hand it is clearly seen that our four adaptation mechanisms greatly enhance the utilities close to the maximum .",
    "the value at which @xmath34 saturates depends on the mechanism of adaptation and also on the parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it was observed that the efficiencies of mechanisms ( b ) and ( d ) are continually improving over time .",
    "this is clearly reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where in the left panel the scaled utilities for mechanisms ( b ) and ( d ) approach asymptotically unity , and in the right panel the quantity @xmath35 reveals the asymtotic behaviour for mechanism ( d ) to be the fastest .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the adaptation mechanisms with parent strategies saved are worthwhile , and best result is achieved with the adaptation mechanism ( d ) , i.e. with the elitist scheme .",
    "later we will investigate in detail the parametric dependence of mechanism ( d ) in comparison with the simplest adaptation mechanism ( a ) .    in order to examine the evolution of strategies in the agents pools we use the hamming distance , which serves as a measure",
    "how similar the strategies in the pools are .",
    "the hamming distance between two strategies is defined as the ratio of the uncommon bits to the total length of the strategy , denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "the strategies are said to be `` correlated '' , if all the bits are pairwise the same , i.e. @xmath37 ; `` anticorrelated '' , if all bits are opposite , i.e. @xmath38 , and they are `` uncorrelated '' when exactly one half of the bits differ , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "let us now consider the average hamming distance , which for the whole strategy space is calculated by first taking the average of the hamming distances over all possible strategy pairs in the agent s pool , and then taking the average over all the agents .",
    "while it is obvious that individual hamming distances between pairs of strategies can change as a result of genetic crossovers , the situation is more complex for the overall average hamming distance . as a matter of fact in the adaptation schemes in which the parent strategies after crossover are replaced by their offsprings ( i.e. schemes ( a ) and ( c ) )",
    ", all the bits in the agent s strategy pool and for that matter in the whole strategy space remain the same and thus no change in the average hamming distance can take place .",
    "so this measure is useful only for the games where the bits in a strategy pool can change over time , i.e. adaptation schemes ( b ) and ( d ) depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig6ja11 ] . here",
    "it is seen that as the game evolves , the average hamming distance decreases in both cases towards small values , but for scheme ( b ) game this happens considerably slower than for the scheme ( d ) game . in the latter case",
    "@xmath36 reaches very small values , indicating that each agent tends to end up using a particular strategy in its pool for best performance . in the case of scheme ( b )",
    "the same tendency exists but one would have to wait at least an oder of magnitude longer to achieve the same level of singularity among strategies . on the other hand the plots of @xmath11 ( i.e. the number of agents choosing a particular action , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) shows that these strategies are such that the total utility , and thus the efficiency of the system tends to maximize . in fig .",
    "[ fig6ja11 ] we have depicted results of varying the memory size @xmath4 and the number of strategies @xmath8 in each agent s pool . we can observe that in the case of adaptation mechanism ( b ) increasing @xmath4 while keeping @xmath40 fixed makes the decay in the average hamming distance faster , yielding @xmath41 case the fastest decaying , overall for adaptation scheme ( b ) . on the other hand , increasing @xmath8 and keeping @xmath25 fixed does not seem to yield systematic behaviour , while @xmath40 case seems to give rise to the fastest decay in the average hamming distance . in the case of adaptation mechanism ( d )",
    "the situation is even less systematic , since increasing @xmath4 and keeping @xmath40 fixed yields @xmath25 case the fastest decaying , overall for adaptation scheme ( d ) , and increasing @xmath8 and keeping @xmath25 yields @xmath42 case the fastest decaying .",
    "next we study a `` test '' situation to investigate whether the genetic operations can increase the performance ( i.e. the number of times an agent wins ) of individual agents in an environment where few agents are allowed to modify their strategies while the others continue using the predetermined set of initial strategies playing the basic minority game . at the beginning",
    "all the agents play the basic minority game and after @xmath43 simulation time steps three of the agents begin to adapt using hybridized genetic crossover with parents saved ( adaptation scheme ( d ) ) and another three agents using one point genetic crossover with parents killed mechanisms ( adaptation scheme ( a ) ) .",
    "all the other agents continue playing the basic minority game .",
    "it turns out that adaptive agents , although some of them were the worst agent at the beginning , outperform all the other agents .",
    "furthermore , we observe that all the agents who use the hybridized genetic crossover mechanism perform better than those using the one point genetic crossover mechanism . nevertheless , the competition in these three agent groups is severe , as clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the success rate , the slope of the performance curve , is clearly different between adaptive and other agents ; the best agents in the basic game stay far below the adaptive ones .",
    "the curves are scaled such that the average performance of all the agents stays zero .",
    "furthermore it is seen in this figure that the adaptive agents stay initially in the neighbourhood of the average performance , but crossovers lead them quickly to success .",
    "let us now move on to analyse the dependence of our adaptive games on the model parameters : memory size @xmath4 , number of strategies in the pool @xmath8 , crossover time @xmath20 , and fraction of worst performing agents @xmath21 . here",
    "we will concentrate mainly on two different adaptation mechanisms : one - point genetic crossover with offsprings replacing parents ( scheme ( a ) ) , and hybridized genetic crossover with the offsprings replacing the two worst strategies in the agent s pool ( scheme ( d ) ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we present the results of changing the crossover time @xmath20 and the fraction @xmath21 of the worst performing agents .",
    "the series of plots in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] illustrates the effect of changing the crossover time @xmath20 and the value of the fraction @xmath21 of the worst performing agents . in this case",
    "the strategies have been modified using one point genetic crossover mechanism where offsprings replace the parents . in panel",
    "( a ) of this figure we have plotted the total utility @xmath34 for five different values of @xmath20 , while the other parameters were kept fixed , and in panel ( b ) we have plotted the same data for quantity @xmath35 in the log - log scale , since from this panel it is easier to compare the efficiencies at the end of the simulation . in panels ( c ) and",
    "( d ) , we have varied the fraction @xmath21 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 in increments of @xmath46 units , while the rest of the parameters are kept fixed and same as in panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we find in panel ( a ) that as @xmath20 increases it takes longer time for @xmath34 to saturate and the efficiency decreases . on the other panel ( c ) , changing @xmath21 does not have significant effect on the behaviour of the scaled utility .    in order to investigate the dependency of the utility quantity @xmath35 on the memory and on the crossover time , we have carried out extensive simulations for different @xmath4 and @xmath20 values , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . in this case",
    "the memory is increased from @xmath47 in panel ( a ) to @xmath41 in panel ( d ) .",
    "we observe that the decay rate between different adaptation times remain quite the same , and there exists a threshold after which the decay slows down .",
    "it is interesting to note that longer adaptation times lead to higher efficiency as the memory size increases .",
    "this is due to the fact that for higher dimensional strategy space it takes longer time until sufficiently many histories are gone through to verify the success of a particular strategy . on the other hand",
    "if we do not allow this adaptation to happen , strategies are changed too often and even the good ones are likely to be disregarded .",
    "inspired by this observation we have studied also the effect of adaptation time to the final utility value which depends on the simulation time as we will discuss later .    in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] we have studied the effect of changing the memory size @xmath4 and the number of strategies @xmath8 on the quantity @xmath35 . in panel ( a ) as @xmath4 increases we first observe an increase in efficiency , but then it starts to decrease with further increase in @xmath4 . in panel ( b ) as @xmath8 increases the efficiency decreases .",
    "the decay rate remains almost the same for all @xmath8 values as can be seen from the slopes of the curves .",
    "next we study what is the effect of changing memory to the scaled utility as the worst fraction is varied from @xmath48 to @xmath49 and other parameters remain fixed .",
    "results can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , from which we find that the scaled utility increases as @xmath21 increases for moderate @xmath4 values , i.e. from @xmath50 in panel ( a ) to @xmath51 in panel ( c ) .",
    "this behaviour changes for higher @xmath4 values , and shows that the system can reach a more efficient state , if the fraction of adaptive agents at any time is not too high .    as stated before",
    ", we have found that the total utility , at the end of the game , varies with different crossover times , while other parameters were kept fixed .",
    "especially , larger memory values increase the dimension of the strategy space and require longer adaptation times . in order to study this dependency in more detail",
    "we have simulated the hybridized genetic crossover with parents saved mechanism ( i.e. scheme ( d ) ) for several @xmath4 values and different values of total simulation time @xmath52 .",
    "results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "the minima in the curves are found dependent on the simulation time , as can be seen by the slight differences between the curves for same value of @xmath4 but different values of @xmath52 .",
    "if the simulation times were unrestricted there would not exist an increase in the curves as adaptation time increases .",
    "the longer the agent can observe its strategies the more certain it can be of their mutual performance .",
    "if the adaptation time is reduced too much , crossovers take place more at random .",
    "thus it could be envisaged these curves to give guidance for a preferable adaptation time .",
    "intuitively , one could guess that a good adaptation time would be close to @xmath5 , because if the occurrence of a history were uniformly distributed , this would constitute the expectation time for an agent to go through all the histories once and thus see how successful a response determined by a strategy has been in each case .",
    "in this paper we have applied various adaptation mechanisms based on genetic algorithms within the framework of the minority game and found significant changes in the collective and individual behaviour of the agents .",
    "we found that the hybridized genetic crossover mechanism in which the best strategies are chosen as parents and their offsprings replace the two worst strategies in the agent s pool leads the system fast towards a state where the scaled utility tends to its maximum .",
    "this mechanisms is clearly better than those where the parent strategies are chosen randomly and those where parents are replaced by their offsprings .",
    "the pre - eminence of the hybridized mechanism can be seen on the system as well as on the agent level : fluctuations in @xmath11 smooth down quickly and the agents outperform those using other mechanisms participating the same game .",
    "the success of genetic algorithm based adaptation mechanisms in minority games is interesting and suggests its use also in other game theoretic optimization problems .",
    "it should be noted , that the minority game deviates from the traditional optimization problems because it does not include a particular object function or functions that are tried to be maximized .",
    "this makes our finding even more interesting , exposing a certain characteristic of the minority game : if agents have the possibility to adapt trough the responses to the stimuli , they drive towards a state where their own performance improves and the collective of all participants gain maximum amount of utility every time the game is played .",
    "this property is not trivial to understand but it bases on the convergence of strategies in the strategy space towards , in a way , the optimal ones .",
    "they are optimal just in the sense that they tend to bring the maximum utility for the collective , meaning that at each time step the number of agents who win is as large as possible : the number of satisfied individuals is at maximum .",
    "adaptation mechanism further extends the class of phenomena , minority games are roughly able to describe .",
    "this is because the basic minority game lacks an efficient learning mechanism , but still the number of systems where individuals try to improve their performances in competitive environments is huge .",
    "our way to include adaptation is not arbitrary but has analogies with reality and is based on learning and combination of different adaptation schemes , a way that is very simple and common in nature and social systems .",

    "<S> in this paper we introduce adaptation mechanism based on genetic algorithms in minority games . if agents find their performances too low , they modify their strategies in hope to improve their performances and become more successful </S>",
    "<S> . one aim of this study is to find out what happens at the system as well as at the individual agent level . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that adaptation remarkably tightens the competition among the agents , and tries to pull the collective system into a state where the aggregate utility is the largest . </S>",
    "<S> we first make a brief comparative study of the different adaptation mechanisms and then present in more detail parametric studies . </S>",
    "<S> these different adaptation mechanisms broaden the scope of the applications of minority games to the study of complex systems . </S>"
