    "while galactic supernovae are rare , the proliferation of existing or proposed large neutrino detectors has considerably increased the confidence that a high - statistics supernova ( sn ) neutrino signal will eventually be observed .",
    "the scientific harvest would be immense .",
    "most importantly for particle physics , the detailed features of the neutrino signal may reveal the nature of the neutrino mass ordering that is extremely difficult to determine experimentally .    on the other hand , a detailed measurement of the neutrino signal from a galactic sn could yield important clues of the sn explosion mechanism .",
    "neutrinos undoubtedly play a crucial role for the sn dynamics , and neutrino energy deposition behind the sn shock is able to initiate and power the sn explosion  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , still unclear whether this energy deposition is indeed sufficiently strong , and current state - of - the - art models still have problems to produce robust explosions with the observed energies ( cf . , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . empirical constraints on the physics deep inside the sn core would therefore be extremely useful , and neutrinos are the only way for a direct access besides gravitational waves  @xcite",
    ".    the neutrinos emitted by the collapsed sn core will pass through the mantle and envelope of the progenitor star and on the way encounter a vast range of matter densities @xmath3 from nearly nuclear at the neutrinosphere to that of interstellar space .",
    "the wolfenstein effect  @xcite causes a resonance in neutrino oscillations  @xcite when @xmath4 , where the plus and minus sign refers to neutrinos @xmath5 and antineutrinos @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "therefore , depending on the sign of @xmath7 , the resonance occurs in the @xmath5 or the @xmath6 channel  @xcite . for the `` solar '' neutrino mass - squared difference of @xmath8 @xcite",
    "one refers to the `` l - resonance '' ( low density ) while for the `` atmospheric '' one of @xmath9 @xcite to the `` h - resonance '' ( high density ) .",
    "the resonance is particularly important for 13-oscillations because the 13-mixing angle is known to be small so that the classic msw enhancement of flavor conversion in an adiabatic density gradient is a crucial feature  @xcite .    the passage of the shock wave through the density of the h - resonance a few seconds after core - bounce ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shockpropagation ] ) may break adiabaticity , thereby modifying the spectral features of the observable neutrino flux .",
    "therefore , it is conceivable that a future large neutrino detector can measure a small modulation of the neutrino signal caused by the shock - wave propagation , an effect first discussed by schirato and fuller in a seminal paper  @xcite and elaborated by a number of subsequent authors  @xcite . since the density of the h - resonance depends on energy , the observation of such a modulation in different neutrino energies would allow one to trace the shock propagation .",
    "on the other hand , the occurrence of this effect depends on the sign of @xmath10 and the value of @xmath11 , so that observing it in the @xmath0 spectra , the experimentally most accessible channel , would imply that the neutrino mass ordering is inverted and that @xmath2 .",
    "[ fig : shockpropagation ]    we here explore a new feature of the shock - wave `` fingerprint '' in the neutrino signal .",
    "some time after the onset of the explosion a neutrino - driven baryonic wind develops and collides with the earlier , more slowly expanding supernova ejecta .",
    "a reverse shock is seen to form in all models which were computed with sufficient resolution and seems to be a generic feature , although the exact propagation history depends on the detailed dynamics during the early stages of the supernova explosion .",
    "moreover , violent convective instabilities and large anisotropies are observed in the neutrino - heated layer behind the sn shock in multi - dimensional sn simulations and imply a significant angular variation of the instantaneous density profiles even in a single star .",
    "still , the simultaneous propagation of a direct and an inverse shock wave imply that for some time the neutrinos may encounter two subsequent density discontinuities , leading to significantly different spectral features than are caused by a single crossing .",
    "numerical sn simulations do not yet lead to robust explosions so that it remains unclear if an important physical ingredient is missing in our understanding of the sn phenomenon . even assuming that only minor aspects need to be tweaked , this situation implies that hydrodynamic state - of - the - art models of successful explosions with self - consistently determined neutrino fluxes and spectra do not exist at present .",
    "therefore , we limit our discussion to a simple analytic study with a schematic density profile and an example of a detailed numerical model , using for both cases schematic primary neutrino fluxes and spectra that are representative for neutrino spectra discussed in the literature . in this way",
    "we identify a generic `` double dip '' feature caused by the presence of two density discontinuities .",
    "we find that the position of the two dips in time can be connected to the positions of the forward and reverse shock .",
    "the observation of the dips in different energy bins allows therefore not only the identification of the reverse shock but also to trace the propagation of both shocks .",
    "since the neutrino conversion probabilities are energy dependent during the passage of the shocks through the h - resonance , neutrino oscillations can be detected even if the energy spectra of different neutrino flavors have the same shape but different luminosities .",
    "we begin in sec .  2 with an explanation of the reverse shock formation and a discussion of our numerical shock - propagation examples . in sec .",
    "3 we use a schematic model of the density profile to derive analytically the generic features imprinted on the observable neutrino signal . in sec .",
    "4 we use a concrete numerical example of shock and reverse shock propagation to calculate their typical signatures in a large @xmath0 detector . in sec .  5",
    "we discuss and summarize our findings .",
    "relying on the viability of the neutrino - heating mechanism we have performed simulations of supernova explosions that followed the evolution in spherical symmetry until more than 25 seconds after shock formation . in order to include the effects of convection we have also done runs in two dimensions for about one second of post bounce evolution . because of the persistent problems of complete models in obtaining successful explosions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we replaced the high - density interior of the contracting nascent neutron star by a time - dependent inner boundary where the neutrino luminosities and spectra were imposed such that the neutrino energy transfer to the shock was sufficiently strong for shock revival ( for more details , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the density profiles used for the evolving stellar background in the present work ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : shockpropagation ] ) were taken from simulations of a 15  @xmath12 progenitor  @xcite .",
    "although the employed neutrino parameters are in the ballpark of results from elaborate neutrino transport calculations in supernovae , detailed information about neutrino fluxes and spectra that are consistent with explosion models and with the cooling history of the newly formed neutron star are currently not available .",
    "for this reason we consider the density profiles as exemplary for realistic supernova conditions and combine them with a schematic description of the neutrino emission that is supposed to contain generic features of the expected neutrino signal .    [",
    "fig : trajectories ]     +    [ fig : twodimmodels ]    the space - time evolution of the explosion of this 15  @xmath12 star in a spherically symmetric simulation ( i.e. , neglecting the effects of hydrodynamic instabilities ) can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] .",
    "the shock expands from the point of its formation ( not shown in this figure that displays only times later than 70  ms after core bounce ) to a radius of about 100  km where it converts into a standing accretion shock .",
    "its subsequent slow outward motion reflects the quasi - stationary adjustment of its position in response to the decreasing rate of mass infall from the outer stellar layers and to the energy deposition by neutrinos in the `` gain region '' behind the shock . at a radius of about 500  km",
    "the shock reaches a temporary maximum and starts retreating again because of decaying neutrino luminosities and a corresponding drop of the neutrino - heating rate .",
    "the subsequent sharp increase of the neutrino luminosities and of the energy deposition behind the shock is sufficient to trigger a successful explosion `` in a second attempt . ''",
    "this behavior is typical of one - dimensional simulations with conditions close to the threshold for shock revival .    on its way out",
    "the shock reverses the infall of the swept - up matter .",
    "continuous neutrino energy transfer starts an outward acceleration of heated material in the gain layer around the neutron star . at the interface between this `` neutrino - driven wind '' to the outer ejecta",
    "a `` contact discontinuity '' is formed .",
    "it is visible as a strip of compressed density contours somewhat behind the outgoing supernova shock in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] .",
    "even farther behind the forward shock , the neutrino - driven wind , whose velocity increases rapidly with distance from the neutron star , collides with more slowly moving material and is decelerated again . the strongly negative velocity gradient at this location steepens into a reverse shock when the wind velocity begins to exceed the local sound speed  @xcite . in the model of fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] this happens at @xmath13800@xmath14ms post bounce at a radius @xmath151000@xmath14 km .",
    "the forward and reverse shocks are sharp discontinuities where density , pressure ( as all other state variables ) and velocity of the stellar plasma change on the microscopic ( sub - millimeter ) scale of the ion mean free path , on which the dissipation of kinetic to thermal energy in the shock occurs .",
    "in contrast , the `` contact discontinuity '' is characterized by a density jump but constant velocity and pressure .",
    "it emerges in the matter in the transition region between shock - accelerated and neutrino - heated supernova ejecta .",
    "its width is therefore a result of the explosion dynamics and found to be 200300@xmath14 km in our one - dimensional model .",
    "however , because of our exponentially coarsening grid we are able to resolve this outward moving feature only for 23 seconds and are unable to make predictions of its exact structure at later times . a schematic representation of the described structure is given in fig .  [ cartoon ] .",
    "the multi - dimensional situation is much more complex ( cf .",
    "[ fig : twodimmodels ] ) .",
    "the forward shock can now be highly deformed , and the reverse shock , which still separates the supersonically expanding neutrino - driven wind from subsonically moving outer ejecta , shows large angular variation .",
    "this reflects the anisotropy of the fluid flow between the shock and the neutron star , which is characterized by narrow downflows of cool gas and rising bubbles of low - density , neutrino - heated matter .",
    "these convective mass motions create a highly distorted structure in which multiple shocks can occur due to collisions of downflows with expanding , hot matter .",
    "contact discontinuities follow the interface between the rising hot bubbles and shock accelerated plasma that has lower entropy and higher density .",
    "their shape is affected by rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "since the explosion is highly asymmetric , the exact structure varies strongly with the direction .",
    "although the generic features of the one - dimensional situation are retained , the details of the multi - dimensional structure evolve chaotically from random initial perturbations and can not be uniquely determined by models .",
    "in present and planned water cherenkov and scintillation detectors the main neutrino detection channel is the inverse beta decay reaction , @xmath16 , that allows also for the reconstruction of the neutrino energies .",
    "therefore we consider only the @xmath0 spectrum in the following .",
    "however an analogous analysis can be easily performed in the neutrino channel for a detector able to measure the @xmath17 spectrum , using e.g. liquid argon .",
    "the antineutrino spectra arriving at the earth are determined by the primary antineutrino spectra as well as the neutrino mixing scenario , f_(e ) = |p(e ) f_^0(e ) + [ 1-|p(e ) ] f_^0(e ) , [ pbar - def ] where @xmath18 is the survival probability of a @xmath0 with energy @xmath19 after propagation through the sn mantle , the superscript zero denotes the primary fluxes , and @xmath20 stands for either @xmath21 or @xmath22 . in general , all quantities of eq .",
    "( [ pbar - def ] ) are not only energy but also time dependent . in particular the survival probability @xmath18 becomes time dependent during the passage of the shocks through the h - resonance .",
    "before we discuss the effect of the shock propagation on the neutrino spectra , we first recall the case of three - flavor neutrino oscillations in a static density profile . in this case , @xmath18 is not only constant in time , but also independent of energy if @xmath23 or @xmath24 . since about 60% of the observed neutrinos",
    "will be detected in the first two seconds after bounce , i.e. before the shock reaches the h - resonance of low - energy neutrinos , it is for many purposes sufficient to perform the simpler analysis of neutrino propagation through the static envelope of the progenitor . for us ,",
    "the static case discussed in the next subsection serves as a reference to measure the modulations induced by the propagating shock .",
    "the survival probability is determined by the flavor conversions that take place in the resonance layers , where @xmath25 .",
    "here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the relevant mass difference and mixing angle of the neutrinos , @xmath28 is the nucleon mass , @xmath29 the fermi constant and @xmath30 the electron fraction .",
    "in contrast to the solar case , sn neutrinos must pass through two resonance layers : the h - resonance layer at @xmath31  g/@xmath32 corresponds to @xmath33 , whereas the l - resonance layer at @xmath34  g/@xmath32 corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "this hierarchy of the resonance densities , along with their relatively small widths , allows the transitions in the two resonance layers to be considered independently  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino survival probabilities can be characterized by the degree of adiabaticity of the resonances traversed , which are directly connected to the neutrino mixing scheme . in particular , whereas the l - resonance is always adiabatic and appears only in the neutrino channel , the adiabaticity of the h - resonance depends on the value of @xmath11 , and the resonance shows up in the neutrino or antineutrino channel for a normal or inverted mass hierarchy respectively .",
    "table  [ tab - pbar ] shows the survival probabilities for neutrinos , @xmath36 , and antineutrinos , @xmath37 , in various mixing scenarios . for intermediate values of @xmath11 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath38 , the survival probabilities depend even without shock on energy as well as the details of the density profile of the sn .    for large values of @xmath11 and the static density profile of the progenitor ,",
    "the h - resonance is adiabatic . in the case of normal mass hierarchy ,",
    "scenario a , the resonance takes place in the neutrino channel , and antineutrinos are not affected . for an inverted mass hierarchy , scenario b , the resonance occurs in the antineutrino channel , so that practically all the primary @xmath39 are converted to @xmath40 and arrive at the earth as @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to an almost complete interchange of @xmath39 and @xmath20 spectra . in scenario c ,",
    "the resonance is strongly non - adiabatic , and hence ineffective . in both the scenarios",

    "the parameter @xmath44 measures the pinching of the observed spectrum and indicates therefore if it is a superposition of primary spectra with different shapes .",
    "we compare the case where both forward and reverse shock waves are present with the forward shock only case .",
    "we approximate the latter by setting @xmath45 .    in the absence of shock waves",
    ", the adiabaticity of the propagation in case b ensures that the @xmath39 flux arriving at the earth , @xmath46 , basically coincides with @xmath47 .",
    "thus , breaking that adiabaticity will imply a partial presence of @xmath48 in @xmath46 .",
    "therefore any departure of the observables from their values in the no - shock case induced by the shock depends strongly on which part of the energy spectra is affected by the shock wave , and how different the original spectra are at those energies .    at early times , @xmath49  s , the shock affects only the low - energy part of the spectra , @xmath50  mev . at these energies ,",
    "the ratio @xmath51 varies for different sn models : it is smaller than one in model l and larger than one in models g1 and g2 .",
    "therefore , any modulation in the observables at these early times will strongly depend on the model considered . at later times , @xmath52  s , neutrinos with higher energies , @xmath53  mev , feel the breakdown of the adiabaticity . at these energies ,",
    "the @xmath20 flux is in all models larger than the @xmath39 flux , @xmath54",
    ". therefore our prediction for the observable modulation of sn neutrino spectra at later times , @xmath55  s , will be model independent and thus more robust .",
    "for this reason , we will basically concentrate the discussion on the modulation of the observables arising at these times .",
    "the main effect visible in the time evolution of @xmath56 shown in the left panel of fig .  [ time - an ] is a decrease of @xmath56 when the shock passes the resonance region and reduces the number of events at high energies .",
    "however , the details will depend on the features of the shock propagation .",
    "if only the forward shock wave is present , a deep and wide dip is expected .",
    "if moreover a reverse shock is formed , a double dip will be observed : the positions of the two dips correspond to the times when one of the peaks in the survival probability in fig .",
    "[ squarewave ] coincides with the peak energy of the antineutrino spectrum . in the case of",
    "@xmath57 the double dip structure becomes a double bump .",
    "in contrast to an energy - independent survival probability , @xmath44 is not always increased by mixing but can be also reduced .",
    "it is remarkable that even in the model g2 , where the original mean energies @xmath58 are exactly the same , the energy dependence of the conversion probability results in an observable effect of the shock wave propagation , because of the flavor - dependent fluxes .",
    "note that in this section we have assumed that the level crossings are completely adiabatic except at the forward and reverse shocks . for @xmath59 close to its current upper limit , this is very likely to be the case . in the next section , we numerically calculate the survival probability without the foregoing assumption , and find that the qualitative features obtained here do indeed survive in the complete numerical calculation .",
    "these features are thus robust , and though illustrated here for the case of a special shock profile , should be valid for a general case .",
    "in this section , we examine in more detail the signatures of the forward and reverse shock propagation imprinted on the neutrino signal of a future galactic sn .",

    "qualitatively , we observe the same features as using the analytical approximation of sec .",
    "[ analytical ] : while the survival probability has a single peak if there is only a forward shock propagating , the reverse shock superimposes a dip at those energies for which the resonance region is passed by both shock waves .",

    "we find that the effects of the shock wave propagation are clearly visible in the neutrino signal of a megaton detector , independent of the assumptions about the initial neutrino spectra .",
    "moreover , it is not only possible to detect the shock wave propagation in general , but also to identify the specific imprints of the forward and reverse shock versus the forward shock only case .",

    "such modulations in the value of @xmath44 that coincide in time with the modulations in @xmath83 act as a confirming evidence for the passage of the shock wave .",
    "another observable that can be exploited is the total number of detected events . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ n ] , we show the number of events binned in time .",
    "this observable is particularly interesting for detectors like icecube with poor or no energy resolution at all for sn neutrinos .",
    "if the luminosities are fast decreasing with time , the modulations introduced by the time - behavior of @xmath61 may be difficult to disentangle from the overall time - behavior of the luminosities .",
    "nevertheless , even a detector without energy resolution like icecube has a potential to discover the imprint of propagating shock waves on the neutrino signal , if the luminosities are not decreasing as fast as found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the information about the shock fronts is encoded in the energy and time dependence of the survival probability @xmath61 , one can expect that the number of events in a fixed energy range is a more useful observable than the total number of events . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ n ] , we show therefore the number of events binned in energy intervals of 10  mev as function of time for the case of a reverse shock .",
    "we can observe clearly how the positions of the two dips change in each energy bin .",
    "it is remarkable that the double - dip feature is not only stronger after binning , but also allows one to trace the shock propagation : given the neutrino mixing scheme , the neutrino energy fixes the resonance density .",
    "therefore , the progress of the shock fronts can be read off from the position of the double - dip in the neutrino spectra of different energy .",
    "we illustrate this by examining the time evolution of the number of events in the bin @xmath84  mev in detail . from fig .",
    "[ ebinned ] , right panel , it can be read off that between 4.57.5  s , the neutrinos with this energy pass through two nonadiabatic resonances , i.e. both the forward and the reverse shock are present in the regions with density @xmath85  g/@xmath32 . between 7.5  s and 9.5  s , only one of the shock fronts is present at this density .",
    "this inferred behavior of the shock wave can be seen to correspond with the shock profile used , see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ ebinned ] . for times before 4.5",
    "s and after 9.5  s , the data is not able to say anything concrete about the shock wave propagation .",
    "if only the forward shock is present , then fig .",
    "[ ebinned ] still allows us to infer that one shock wave was present in the region @xmath86 between 59.5  s. no concrete conclusions can be drawn about the behavior of the shock wave beyond this time interval .",
    "the number of shock waves present in a region with any given density @xmath87  g/@xmath32 can similarly be extracted from the data by considering the time evolution of the number of events in the energy bin corresponding to that density .",
    "an extrapolation would allow one to trace the positions of the forward and the reverse shock waves for times between 110  s.    until now we have neglected the possibility that other discontinuities in addition to the forward and reverse shock can influence the neutrino propagation .",
    "however , because of the decreasing resolution in our simulation at large radii as described in sec .  2",
    ", we are only able to resolve the outward moving contact discontinuity for 23 seconds .",
    "its width at that time is found to be 200300@xmath14 km in our one - dimensional model .",
    "hydrodynamic instabilities are expected to widen the contact discontinuity , and we expect therefore that the neutrino evolution is adiabatic also at later times at this discontinuity . but to get an idea of the possible influence of this discontinuity on observables , we have steepened it by hand for @xmath88  s , so that the neutrino evolution becomes strongly non - adiabatic at this point . in fig",
    ".  [ discontinuity ] , we show the detected @xmath56 in this case . since now there are three shocks ( and six associated energies ) ,",
    "the structures in @xmath56 become more complicated but the imprint of the shock wave is still clearly visible . in particular , there are effects of the shock wave propagation at later times than in the previous cases , because for the density profiles considered in our study the largest density affected by this new discontinuity is larger than the maximum of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .    finally , we want to discuss if the largest currently operating detector , super - kamiokande , can observe the signatures of shock wave propagation .",
    "compared to a megaton detector , the event rate in super - kamiokande is reduced by a factor of 30 . therefore , we plot in the right panel of fig .  [ discontinuity ] the mean event energy @xmath56 with one second time bins in order to decrease the statistical error .",
    "the features of the different shock propagation scenarios remain visible , but are now more difficult to disentangle because of the larger errors .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the number of events is not only related to the volume of the detector but also to the distance to the sn .",
    "thus , the potential of super - kamiokande to yield important clues about the shock propagation can not be dismissed .",
    "we have performed simulations of supernova explosions adjusting the neutrino energy transfer to the shock so that a successful explosion resulted . following the time evolution in spherical symmetry until more than 25  seconds after shock formation",
    ", we have found that in addition to the forward shock wave a reverse shock forms when the supersonically expanding neutrino - driven wind collides with the slower earlier sn ejecta .",
    "both the forward and reverse shock are sharp discontinuities where the density changes on a sub - millimeter scale .",
    "the sudden density jump at the two shock fronts results in a strongly non - adiabatic evolution of neutrino flavor oscillations , when the shocks cross the h - resonance layer . for a `` large '' 13-mixing angle , @xmath2 , the msw enhancement of flavor conversion that is otherwise working",
    "is interrupted during the shock passage .",
    "this break - down of adiabaticity results in a reduction of the average energy and number of detected @xmath0 events for an inverse neutrino mass hierarchy ( case b ) or of @xmath1 events for a normal hierarchy ( case a ) .",
    "the reduced event rate during the shock passage through the h - resonance allows even experiments with missing energy resolution for sn neutrinos , as e.g. icecube , to observe effects of the shock propagation .",
    "the characteristic signature for the presence of two shocks is the `` double - dip '' feature in the time - binned energy spectrum of observed electron - neutrino events .",
    "we have found that already super - kamiokande can potentially distinguish between different shock propagation scenarios , while a megaton detector may be able to trace the time - evolution of forward and reverse shocks .",
    "the modulation of sn neutrino spectra by propagating shocks is only possible if @xmath11 is `` large , '' @xmath2 .",
    "observing these features in the neutrino signal of a future galactic sn would therefore indicate that the measurement of @xmath11 and the detection of leptonic cp violation may be within reach .",
    "in addition , the detection of any modulation in the @xmath0 or the @xmath1 spectrum by shock effects would identify the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "remarkably , observing features of sn shock propagation is complementary to the detection of earth matter effects : while observing modulations by sn shocks in the @xmath0 spectrum identifies case b , modulations by earth matter effects exclude this case .",
    "we want to close with a speculative remark about the time - structure of the neutrino events from sn  1987a .",
    "the events observed by the kamioka experiment can be grouped into two time bins : nine events during the first two seconds , then three more events after a time gap of six seconds .",
    "intriguingly , such a time structure is compatible with the modulation of the neutrino signal by sn shocks , if the neutrino luminosities are decreasing slowly with time .",
    "thus , one might speculate that this gap is connected with the passage of sn shocks through the h - resonance .",
    "then , the sn  1987a signal would be a hint that case b is the true neutrino mixing scenario , i.e.  that the neutrino mass hierarchy is inverted .",
