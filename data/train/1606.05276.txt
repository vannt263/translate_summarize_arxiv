    "these are the shimura operators .",

    "we write @xmath33 for the set of spherical unitary parameters@xmath34 the determination of @xmath33 is an important problem , which is as yet unsolved in complete generality . in this connection ,",

    "these polynomials , denoted @xmath48 in @xcite , are the @xmath49 limits of a family of poynomials introduced by a. okounkov ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 1.1 ) , and they generalize an analogous family defined by one of the authors and studied together with f. knop @xcite . to describe the @xmath50 it is convenient to define @xmath51 and to set @xmath52 the polynomial @xmath47 has total degree @xmath53 in @xmath54 , its coefficients are rational functions in two parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 , it is even and symmetric , i.e. invariant under all permutations and sign changes of the @xmath57 , and among all such polynomials it is characterized up to scalar multiple by its vanishing at points of the form@xmath58 for generic @xmath55 the set @xmath59 is a linear basis of the space @xmath60 of even symmetric polynomials .",
    "now suppose @xmath4 is a hermitian symmetric space as before .",

    "this identifies @xmath66 with the group of all permutation and sign changes , and @xmath67 with the algebra @xmath60 .",
