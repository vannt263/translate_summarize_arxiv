    "observations with the _ einstein _ observatory ipc found elliptical galaxies to be strong emitters of x - rays ; and , a rich diversity and complexity of spatial and spectral characteristics were subsequently revealed by observations with the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ satellites .",
    "the emission from the most luminous galaxies is dominated by hot gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in a galactic potential that includes dark matter .",
    "density , temperature , and metallicity distributions in the hot gas derived from these data enabled investigators to measure the dark matter content in these galaxies and constrain the dynamical and chemical evolution of their gaseous and stellar constituents @xcite .",
    "in addition to emission from 0.51 kev gas , an observable hard x - ray component from the ensemble of galactic x - ray binaries is expected .",
    "the presence of such a component was inferred from the ipc data @xcite , and was first directly detected in bbxrt observations of ngc 1399 and ngc 4472 @xcite .",
    "_ asca _ observations first revealed the hard component to be extended in some galaxies @xcite .",
    "the nature of the hard component is of fundamental interest for a number of reasons .",
    "if it originates solely from x - ray binaries , the hard component should scale as the optical light ( both within individual and among different galaxies ) with the same proportionality observed in the bulges of spiral galaxies . if the correlation is not linear , or if the ratio of hard x - ray to optical luminosity differs in magnitude or dispersion from the spiral bulge value , a fundamental difference between the stellar populations of bulges and ellipticals may be indicated",
    "this would have important implications for , e.g. , the type ia supernova rate and the formation of ellipticals .",
    "moreover , since the depth of the potential well ( the velocity dispersion ) , and hence the ability to retain hot gas , decreases with optical luminosity , the hard component should be increasingly important for fainter galaxies , ultimately dominating below some luminosity that depends on  and therefore can help constrain  how the dark matter content and type ia supernova rate scale with luminosity @xcite .",
    "additional sources of hard component emission might originate from a low - luminosity active nucleus associated with dynamically - inferred supermassive black holes , or from inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background and/or nonthermal bremsstrahlung associated with an extended halo of high energy electrons .",
    "finally , understanding the hard component can help resolve some of the ambiguities inherent in current fitting of _ asca _ spectra that are the source of a systematic uncertainty in the hot gas metallicity .",
    "analysis of _ asca _ data allowed spectral decompositions into soft ( hot gas ) and hard ( x - ray binary ) components for a large number of elliptical galaxies for the first time .",
    "@xcite derived hard component fluxes for 27 early - type galaxies by fitting _",
    "spectra , extracted from circular regions enclosing four ( optical ) half - light radii @xmath3 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath4% of the optical light ) , with models composed of thermal plasma and 10 kev thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",

    "1997 . ) in the 0.5 - 10.0 kev band , the flux emitted by the hard component inside these radii ( 38.5@xmath5 ) was estimated to range from @xmath6@xmath7 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ( see , also , matsumoto et al .",
    "although many galaxies roughly follow the expected linear trend , there are many cases of excess emission . based on examination of the _ rosat _ image ,",
    "a low - luminosity agn is the likely explanation for the most extreme case , ic 1459 , while extended emission possibly associated with the virgo ( fornax ) cluster is a possible contributor in ngc 4472 ( ngc 1399 ) .",
    "@xcite argued for the presence of an additional intermediate temperature ( @xmath82 kev ) component to replace or augment the x - ray binary component that leads to higher abundances in spectral fits . using a similar approach , @xcite inferred the presence of a hard component described by a flat power - law originating from a radiatively inefficient accretion disk around a supermassive black hole .",
    "@xcite presented evidence for an extended inverse compton or non - thermal bremsstrahlung component in the x - ray emission from galaxy groups ( that otherwise strongly resemble the extended emission around some elliptical galaxies ) , similar in nature to that observed in some clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "identification and analysis of possible hard x - ray emission from extended thermal , extended non - thermal , or nuclear non - thermal components using _ asca _ are severely limited by the rapidly declining effective area above 2 kev , the broad psf , and dilution from the ubiquitous presence of hot interstellar gas .",
    "three non - active ellipticals  ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , and ngc 4636 @xcite  were observed with the _ ginga _ lac that has a larger @xmath9 kev collecting area .",
    "initial ( pre-_asca_/_rosat _ ) studies fit the 2 - 10 kev spectra with one - component models , and the higher temperatures and 2 - 10 fluxes as compared to subsequent _ asca _ and _ rosat _ results are suggestive of the presence of a significant extended hard component .",
    "we re - analyzed the background - subtracted _ ginga _ top - layer spectra for these galaxies , extracted from the ledas data base .",
    "two - component fits including a soft component determined by the _",
    "asca _ spectra require a strong hard component with 2 - 10 kev fluxes of @xmath10 , 12 , and @xmath11 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 for ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , and ngc 4636 , respectively .",
    "the hard component ( thermal bremsstrahlung ) temperatures of 520 kev for ngc 4472 and ngc 4636 and 25 kev for ngc 1399 are compatible with the _ asca _ spectra ; however , the fluxes are well in excess ( by a factor of @xmath12 ) of what is formally allowed in the _ asca _ fits .",
    "( for ngc 1399 , the bbxrt estimate of the hard component flux is closer to the _ ginga _ than the _ asca _ estimate . )",
    "how might the _ asca _ and _ ginga _ fluxes be reconciled ?",
    "perhaps systematic background uncertainties that can be considerable for _ ginga _ and at high energies for _ asca _ are responsible  note that the _ ginga _ background subtraction quality is deemed acceptable only in the case of ngc 1399 . or perhaps the hard component is more extended , or has a harder and/or more complex spectrum than anticipated .",
    "_ rxte _ observations can greatly facilitate our understanding of this poorly understood hard component in elliptical galaxies because of the large effective area of the proportional counter array ( pca ) in the 2 - 20 kev band ( @xmath13 @xmath14 for each of five proportional counter units , pcus ) .",
    "with the recent improvement in background modeling , pca spectra ( alone , and combined with _",
    "spectra ) can be analyzed to confirm or disconfirm the tentative _ ginga _ results and , if the former , distinguish among different emission mechanisms and constrain spectral model parameters . for our initial study , representing the first _",

    "several arguments support a thermal intracluster origin for the extended hard emission . in particular , the extended component spectra are consistent with what one expects for the virgo icm  especially for ngc 4472 where an fe k feature of reasonable strength is consistent with the data .",
    "temperatures are in line with previous measurements @xcite , with the lower temperature for ngc 4472 perhaps reflecting the shallower gravitational potential of the ngc 4472 sub - cluster rather than the virgo cluster at large .",
    "the similarity of the ngc 4472 and ngc 4649 extended component fluxes also argues for an `` external '' origin .",
    "if , instead , it were associated with some population of relativistic particles co - existing with the _ galactic _ thermal plasma , one would expect stronger emission from ngc 4472 with its more luminous and extended soft x - ray halo : the total ngc 4472 gas mass is @xmath106 times that of ngc 4649 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the icm temperature for ngc 4649 is somewhat higher than might be expected , and the very low abundance upper limit inferred from the absence of fe k emission may be puzzling  although abundance gradients have been measured ( e.g. , kikuchi et al . 1999 ) accurate measurements localized to large radii are rare ( the distance of ngc 4649 from the center of the virgo cluster is approximately the cluster virial radius ) .",
    "moreover , assuming an accurate _ rosat_/_rxte _ cross - calibration , the 2 - 10 kev flux is 30150% higher than calculated based on an extension of the pspc flux and ngc 4472 icm model ( although consistent if the ngc 4649 icm model is used ) .",
    "perhaps there is an additional nonthermal _ cluster _ component present at modest levels in the pca spectra of both galaxies .",
    "the combined pca / gis dataset enable us to place improved limits on the parameters of the compact ( galactic ) hard component  assumed here to originate as the integrated emission from galactic x - ray binaries ( see tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "if the extended hard component is assumed to be a power - law for both galaxies , the binary component temperature constraints are disjoint ( table 1 )  3.86.6 ( @xmath107 ) kev for ngc 4472 ( ngc 4649 ) , but the fluxes ( table 2 ) consistent when normalized to the optical luminosities ( ngc 4472 is @xmath108% brighter ) .",
    "conversely , the binary temperatures are consistent assuming thermal ( icm ) models for the extended components ",
    "5.29.1 ( @xmath109 ) kev for ngc 4472 ( ngc 4649 ) , but the ngc 4472 x - ray flux exceeds that of ngc 4649 by a factor of @xmath110 ( 1.4 relative to their respective optical luminosities ) .",
    "thus there are apparent differences in the binary populations , even though the stellar populations of these galaxies are nearly indistinguishable @xcite .",
    "this confirms the findings of @xcite based on _ asca _ data alone , who finds a significant range in the ratio of x - ray binary to optical luminosity amongst ellipticals in general , and a similar luminosity variation between ngc 4472 and ngc 4649 to that reported above .",
    "the x - ray - to - blue luminosity ratio is a factor of 2.03.5 ( 1.52.5 ) times greater for ngc 4472 ( ngc 4649 ) than the typical values inferred from earlier _ asca _ spectral analysis @xcite .",
    "an extension of the galactic ( @xmath28 ) binary component ( as might be expected from , e.g. , an extended halo of globular clusters ) can account for the extended hard component in ngc 4649 without violation of the measured diffuse pspc intensity , although models with a spectrally distinct extended component provide formally superior fits ( see section 4.2 and table 1 ) .",
    "however , since this is not the case for ngc 4472 ( with its more prominent globular cluster population and larger x - ray extent ) , we consider this an unlikely explanation for the excess flux detected with the pca .",
    "allen et al . ( 2000 ) fit _ asca _ spectra with a model consisting of a two - phase ism plus a relatively flat ( compared to luminous agn ) power - law , identifying the latter with a new type of low - luminosity , spectrally hard nuclear x - ray source .",
    "figures 6 and 7 ( `` @xmath111 '' plots , as in figures 3 and 5 ) show their derived power - law components ( best - fits and 90% confidence limits ) superposed on the pca data . at energies below 10 kev , this component would be overwhelmed by the extended hard emission , but should become conspicuous at higher energies .",
    "the presence of such a component is ruled out in ngc 4649 by the virtual absence of @xmath112 kev pca counts , but appears to be present in the binned hard spectrum of ngc 4472 .",
    "note , however , that its addition does not improve global spectral fits and the formal upper limit for such a component is comparable to what is derived by allen et al . (",
    "moreover , recent _ chandra _ results ( loewenstein et al . , in preparation ) rule out a nuclear point source of this magnitude in ngc 4472 unless the emission below @xmath113 kev is cut off by absorption . for ngc 4649",
    ", we derive an upper limit of @xmath114 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 to the 2 - 10 kev flux of any additional power - law component with slope equal to the best - fit value from allen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , @xmath115 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 if their steepest allowed slope is assumed , compared to their inferred flux of @xmath116 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 .",
    "these are derived from fits that include pca energies up to 30 kev ; if only the 10 - 30 kev pca band is utilized , the former limit is reduced to @xmath117 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 .",
    "the x - ray emission from the optical portions of elliptical galaxies includes contributions from both hot interstellar gas and x - ray binaries . using newly obtained _ rxte _ data we have detected and investigated an additional component that is both spectrally and spatially distinct , being more extended than the galactic emission and of a hardness intermediate between the two galactic components .",
    "the extended hard component can be modeled as a steep ( @xmath118 ) power - law in the 2 - 10 kev band , but is perhaps more naturally explained as a thermal plasma .    the fact that the ratio of extended hard component flux in ngc 4472 to that in ngc 4649 is consistent with the ratio of local diffuse virgo cluster soft x - ray intensity suggests that this emission is predominantly associated with the cluster and not the individual galaxies ( the ngc 4472 galactic emission is @xmath10 times brighter ) , and the spectral parameters ( @xmath119 kev and @xmath120 solar for ngc 4472 , @xmath121 kev , @xmath122 solar for ngc 4649 ) are reasonable for virgo intracluster plasma  though somewhat extreme for ngc 4649 .",
    "however , the measured pca and gis 2 - 10 kev intensities of this diffuse emission are significantly greater than expected based on the soft diffuse surface brightness measured by the pspc , leaving open the possibility of the presence of an additional nonthermal source of hard x - rays at the @xmath123 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath100 ( 2 - 10 kev ) level .",
    "we also placed new limits on the temperature and 2 - 10 kev flux of the integrated x - ray binary component , although their precise values depend on the model employed for the extended hard component . despite the similarities of their stellar populations , the binary populations in ngc 4472 and ngc 4649 are distinct .",
    "if the extended hard component is modeled as thermal plasma emission , the ratio of x - ray binary to optical luminosity is a factor of 1.4 larger for ngc 4472 than for ngc 4649 .",
    "finally , there is a suggestion of a flat - power law contribution to the very high energy ( @xmath124 kev ) x - ray spectrum of ngc 4472 at a level consistent with that suggested by allen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to arise from the galactic nucleus ; however , such a component is not evident in the ngc 4649 spectrum .    in this paper , we emphasize the spatial and spectral complexity of the hard x - ray emission from elliptical galaxies and make some tentative first steps toward understanding its origin and nature .",
    "further progress awaits hard x - ray observation of more ellipticals , and improved hard x - ray imaging data .",
