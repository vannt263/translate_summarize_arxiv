    "tio@xmath2 plays an important role in the fields of dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) and photocatalysis . for both applications tio@xmath2",
    "requires tailor made electronic properties , which can be manipulated by selectively diluting the system by insertion of dopants .",
    "dms have been investigated in the past in order to gain new insights in the functional principles and the manipulation of the magnetic and semiconducting properties .",
    "the search for magnetic semiconductors or for half - metals used for spin - injection led to the discovery of the new material class of @xmath3-electron magnets .",
    "the prospect of controlling the charge and the electron spin as information carriers would make it possible to combine information processing and storage at the same time @xcite .",
    "the second major application is in the field of photocatalysis , where the favourable electronic gap range of @xmath4 ev can be also achieved by doping @xcite .",
    "regarding rutile tio@xmath2 from a photocatalytic point of view we are especially interested in the manipulation of the band gap by incorporation of impurities .",
    "rutile tio@xmath2 has a band gap of @xmath5 ev , which corresponds to an absorption spectrum in the ultraviolet region .",
    "the absorption of photons lead to the creation of electron hole pairs , which are of special relevance for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical applications like the photo - induced decomposition of water on tio@xmath2 electrodes demonstrated by fujishima and honda @xcite .",
    "another line of research regards the photocatalytic properties ; due do the creation of electron hole pairs the valence band ( vb ) becomes oxidative and the conduction band ( cb ) reductive . surrounding molecules can therefore be oxidized or reduced and as a consequence form radicals which are harmful to organic compounds like bacteria and fungi .",
    "hence , tio@xmath2 can be used as a purifier , removing gaseous or aqueous contaminants @xcite . beside water- and air - purification",
    "there is a wide range of other photocatalytic applications , like antifogging and self - cleaning surfaces @xcite .",
    "since uv light only makes up 5% of the sunlight spectrum one aims to shift the absorption spectrum of tio@xmath2 into the visible region to improve the absorption rate and therefore the photocatalytic efficiency .",
    "several studies have shown that impurities like nitrogen and carbon verifiable modify the band gap . beside computational studies done by divalentin et al .",
    "@xcite and yang et al .",
    "@xcite there are experimental studies confirming the earlier theoretical results .",
    "diwald et al .",
    "@xcite reported a blueshift in the band gap after doping with nitrogen . in a second study @xcite they observed a redshift by inducing nitrogen into the tio@xmath2 rutile host matrix .",
    "for the first case they assumed oxygen atoms being substituted by nitrogen impurities and for the latter nitrogen atoms being placed on interstitial sites .",
    "batzill et al .",
    "@xcite on the other hand reported to see a redshift when substituting o by n. motivated by these partly contradictory reports we perform our theoretical investigation in order to interpret the experimental results .",
    "in the present study we investigate tio@xmath2 rutile doped with carbon and nitrogen atoms , respectively , where we assume c and n either to replace oxygen or to occupy interstitial positions .",
    "although magnetic order is most common in metallic materials with narrow bands of @xmath6- or @xmath7- electrons , the carriers of the magnetic moments in doped semiconductors or insulators like tio@xmath2 are the carbon or nitrogen atoms .",
    "the magnetic moment is produced by the @xmath3-electrons which become polarized because of the flat @xmath3-bands of these impurity atoms @xcite .",
    "this is called @xmath3-electron magnetism and has been investigated intensely during the last years .",
    "there are three common polymorphs of titanium dioxide : rutile , brookite and anatase .",
    "rutile is the thermodynamically most stable modification of tio@xmath2 and is an indirect wide band gap semiconductor with an experimental band gap of @xmath5 ev @xcite .",
    "the rutile structure belongs to the p4@xmath2/mnm ( no .",
    "136 ) tetragonal space group with unit cell parameters of @xmath8   and @xmath9  . in rutile tio@xmath2",
    "every titanium atom is octahedrally coordinated to six oxygen atoms .",
    "the so formed octahedrons show an orthorhombic distortion , with the apical ti - o bond length being slightly longer than the equatorial ti - o bond length .",
    "each tio@xmath10 octahedron is in contact with 10 neighbour octahedrons .",
    "the tio@xmath2 rutile crystal structure therefore can be seen as a chain of edge and corner - sharing tio@xmath10 units @xcite .    beside the investigation of the electronic properties of pristine tio@xmath2",
    ", we examined the effect of c and n atoms incorporated in various concentrations and positions into the host matrix . in total seven different levels and configurations of doping",
    "were examined using _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "fig.[fig : supercell ] depicts the different positions of the c and n dopants in the tio@xmath2 @xmath11 ( 48 atoms ) supercell . in one of the performed calculations we assumed a single oxygen atom of the host matrix to be replaced by c or n ( position ( 1 ) )",
    "this corresponds to a doping concentration of @xmath12 .",
    "further , two substitutional oxygen sites with two c or two n atoms , respectively , were occupied leading to a doping rate of @xmath13 .",
    "this was done for two different configurations investigating the effect of increasing distance between the two impurity atoms . in the first configuration of this double substitutional state the distance between the two dopants",
    "was chosen to be minimal ( position ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) . in the second one",
    "the two dopants were placed on arbitrary oxygen sites ( positions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) ) increasing the distance .",
    "moreover , two different interstitial positions of c and n ( positions ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) ) in the tio@xmath2 host lattice were examined .",
    "finally , we performed a set of calculations exchanging these interstitial dopants by their next nearest oxygen neighbour , so that o and c or n respectively switch position , with a doping concentration of again @xmath12 .",
    "all calculations were performed employing the _ vienna ab - initio simulation package _ ( vasp ) @xcite which uses projector augmented wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials @xcite to describe the potential between the ions .",
    "the semi - core @xmath14 and @xmath3 states for ti and the @xmath15 states for o , c and n respectively were incorporated in the calculations . to save computation time",
    ", the effects of exchange and correlation were initially treated using the gga - pbe approximation @xcite , until all force components were smaller than @xmath16 ev /  . during the relaxation we allowed for a change of the atomic positions , shape and volume of the cell .",
    "the final convergence was done with the post - dft hse06 functional @xcite which is known to yield reliable results for the gap size and the position of the impurity bands inside the gap .",
    "plane waves with an energy up to @xmath17 ev were included in the basis set , in order to avoid pulay stress and other related problems .",
    "the brillouin - zone integration was performed using a @xmath18 @xmath19 centered _ k_-mesh with gaussian smearing set to @xmath20 ev .",
    "the total energy was converged better than @xmath21 ev for all cases investigated .",
    "the limitations of lda and gga+u in predicting the equilibrium lattice constant and the proper band gap @xcite poses problems in the description of the structural and electronic properties of the pristine and doped system .",
    "thus , predicting the position of the impurity states , crucial for photocatalytic reasons , becomes only possible after extracting the appropriate u from experimental data .",
    "to compare and evaluate the structural changes induced by the impurities calculations on pure tio@xmath2 were done initially to obtain structural and electronic data that can be used as a reference .",
    "the calculated lattice parameters of pure tio@xmath2 rutile ( @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ) are in good agreement with the experimental values ( @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ) .",
    "the direct band gaps calculated using the hse06 functional ( @xmath26 ) show a considerably improvement over the gga results ( @xmath27 ) @xcite and are again in in good agreement with experimental values ( @xmath28 ) @xcite .      in total three substitutional cases",
    "were investigated .",
    "i ) one single oxygen becomes substituted by c or n impurity .",
    "further , two oxygen sites are substituted by either two carbons or two nitrogens , considering two different cases ii ) minimizing the distance of the impurities occupying two adjacent oxygen sites , and iii ) the impurities occupy two distant oxygen positions .",
    "the latter two cases allow to study the dependence of the magnetic coupling on the distance of the magnetic ions .    substituting just one oxygen atom by a carbon impurity leads to a magnetic moment of @xmath29 per supercell and arises mainly from the c atom with @xmath30 per carbon atom ( measured within the muffin tin radius 1.63  ) . substituting oxygen by carbon introduces two holes into the system . as",
    "a consequence one complete band on the average becomes unoccupied leading to a semiconducting ground state but with a magnetic moment .",
    "the total moment of @xmath29 per unit cell is composed of the magnetic moment at the carbon site plus the polarizations of the surrounding oxygen .",
    "figure [ fig : onec ] depicts the density of states ( dos ) for the single substitutional case .",
    "the upper panel shows the non - magnetic case of carbon substitution .",
    "the lower one depicts the dos of the equilibrium magnetic state with @xmath29 .",
    "the substitution of n introduces one hole and consequently leads to a magnetic moment of @xmath31 per supercell where @xmath32 are located at the n site ( measured within the muffin tin radius 1.40  ) .",
    "this result agrees with the experimental finding of room temperature ferromagnetism in n - doped rutile tio@xmath2 films by bao et al.@xcite who report a nitrogen moment of about @xmath33 .",
    "the dos for the magnetic and the non - magnetic state is shown in figure [ fig : onen ] .",
    "introducing dopants into the tio@xmath2 rutile crystal leads to a change in the atomic distances .",
    "changes of the bond lengths between the oxygen ( of the undoped system ) , the substituted carbon and the substituted nitrogen atom to its next neighbours ( nn ) , respectively , were compared .",
    "the atomic distances of the pristine crystal lattice were normalized to those of the doped systems using its relaxed volume . by doing",
    "so we considered increased distances caused by the larger ionic volume of the c and n dopant .",
    "table [ table : oneimp ] gives an overview on the bond lengths in the respective system .",
    "both the n and the c atom causes an enlargement of the atomic distances in the crystal . due to the higher electronegativity of n(@xmath34)@xmath35c(@xmath36 ) @xcite , nitrogen tends to interact more with the host semiconductor in particular with the neighbouring oxygens .",
    "this leads to shorter bond lengths for n to its next neighbours than for c. these results are again in line with the dos shown in figure 3 and 4 .",
    "the larger bond lengths and the consequently weaker bonding to the host semiconductor makes the @xmath37 states of the c atom more localized in the gap and the c states which occur in the vb and cb due to the weaker interaction with o are smaller than in the n case .",
    "the @xmath37 states of nitrogen are mostly located in the vb and cb , induced by the stronger bonding . as a consequence carbon doped tio@xmath2 rutile",
    "has a smaller band gap than the nitrogen doped system ( table [ table : oneimp ] ) .    to investigate the stability of the doped system we calculated the defect formation energies according to the following formula @xcite : @xmath38=e_{tot}[x]-e_{tot}[bulk]+n(\\mu_{o}-\\mu_{x})\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the total energy of the doped supercell with one oxygen atom replaced by the impurity x(x = c , n ) , @xmath40 $ ] the total energy for the pristine system .",
    "@xmath41 indicates the number of oxygen atoms that have been replaced in the supercell by dopant atoms , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the corresponding chemical potentials .",
    "the stability of the various configurations differ with the oxygen chemical potential .",
    "@xmath42 describes the oxygen environment during synthesis and therefore effects the defect formation energies .",
    "we define the oxygen chemical potential being @xmath42=@xmath44+@xmath45 with @xmath45 ranging from 0 ev to -4 ev , whereas @xmath45=0 ev defines the oxygen rich and @xmath45=-4 ev the oxygen poor case .",
    "the oxygen poor case is approximately half the hse calculated formation enthalpy of rutile tio@xmath2 with @xmath46 which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 9.80 ev @xcite . to give a more conceptual measure of the oxygen concentration we convert @xmath45 to oxygen pressure at a temperature of 1000k ( top x - axis ) , typical for annealing of rutile tio@xmath2 @xcite .    in the tables below we list the defect formation energy for the different doping configurations considering the oxygen rich case .",
    "the chemical potentials were calculated with respect to c in diamond , n in n@xmath2 and o in o@xmath2 .",

    "the final investigation deals with carbon and nitrogen placed on interstitial sites ( sites ( 4),(5 ) in fig.[fig : supercell ] ) and their interaction with the respective neighbouring oxygen . upon putting carbon on either of the 2 interstitial sites we find that the electronic structure is very similar and no magnetic moment appears .",
    "we thus restrict ourselves to present only the density of states for interstitial site ( 4 ) ( see figure [ fig : intercn ] ) , the respective electron density is given in figure [ fig : tausch_int_cn1](a ) .",
    "the interaction of the interstitial carbon with the host lattice is almost negligible and c forms atomic like flat bands at the bottom of the tio@xmath2 gap , which is also reflected in the electron density .",
    "the non - magnetic state is easily explained from the even number of electrons .",
    "in contrast to free carbon , which has a total spin of 1 , the small but present crystal field from the host lattice leads to a double occupation of a single @xmath3-orbital and hence a total spin of zero .",
    "the same mechanism can be applied to nitrogen with the only difference that n has 3 @xmath3-electrons and consequently always one singly occupied orbital with a resulting total spin of @xmath52 . energetically we find that c / n sits on a saddle point of the total energy surface . upon shifting c / n slightly to either side , the interstitial atoms approach their oxygen neighbours and form co and no molecule type entities which is accompanied by a dramatic change in the electronic structure .",
    "the highly reactive oxygen tries to reach its 2@xmath53 state , by forming a co or no molecule which ends up almost at the original oxygen position .",

    "we also performed a second set of calculations , where c / n are placed on an oxygen position and this oxygen is put at an interstitial site . starting from this configuration and after relaxation again led to the formation of co and no dimers with the same total energy as before .",

    "one clearly sees the molecular structure with a bond length of 1.22   for co and 1.31   for no . for carbon",
    "the bond length agrees with the co double - bond length of 1.20  , for nitrogen the agreement is less good and lies between the no single - bond length of 1.45   and the double - bond length of 1.17   @xcite which may be caused by the fact that the no `` molecule '' exhibits a magnetic moment of 1@xmath54 .",
