    "the purpose of this paper is to explore possibilities of describing quark chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) with confining forces , in the simplest case of zero temperature and density , the only case we consider here ( for finite temperature and density , see @xcite and references therein ) , without running into difficult infrared ( ir ) singularities .",
    "csb has two essential manifestations : a running quark mass @xmath7 with finite @xmath3 , and a massless pion .",
    "any such description of csb with confinement alone must also resolve the dilemma that confining forces ( such as the usual linearly - rising potential @xmath11 , for string tension @xmath12 ) plus kinetic energy terms apparently have no negative terms that could lead to a massless pion .",
    "many papers have been written on csb with confinement , but the present approach differs from those known to the author .",
    "there are a number of papers @xcite that make some attempt to model area - law confinement as it might arise in qcd ( as opposed to purely phenomenological effective propagators , njl models , and so on ) ; all of them make one approximation or another , and ours is no exception .",
    "this paper differs from most of the cited papers by attempting to maintain covariance and avoiding the use of special gauges , such as coulomb gauge , within the context of a euclidean gap equation with confining forces .",
    "the present paper makes two major points .",
    "the first is to argue that entropic effects ( embodied in large spacetime fluctuations in worldlines of pions that are composites of massless quarks ) may well be a major source of negative terms necessary for a massless pion with area - law confinement ( see @xcite for an early description of entropic contributions ) .",
    "these entropic effects come from the masslessness of the quarks and of the ( goldstone ) pion , with the consequence that a pionic @xmath13 wilson loop with a large longitudinal separation between initial and final points is highly ramified or branched .",
    "anywhere along the perimeter , large transverse separation of @xmath14 from @xmath15 is exponentially disfavored because of the consequent large area - law action penalty ; separation of more than about @xmath16 practically never occurs .",
    "a linearly - rising potential is irrelevant for larger separations .",
    "because the long , twisting , and narrow branches are made of massless constituents having a massless bound state , their action per unit length is too small to overcome entropy .",
    "these branches signal the formation of a @xmath17 condensate .",
    "[ formation of the condensate as branches of a @xmath13 wilson loop may have something to do with the light - cone interpretation @xcite of condensates as objects localized with respect to hadrons ; we take no position on this possibility . ] on general grounds we show that the entropic effects should contribute a term @xmath6 to the pion mass , and that if only kinetic energy and linearly - rising potential terms are kept , masslessness of the pion is assured if @xmath3 has a specific value @xmath18 . that this entropic term is negative",
    "is crucial , since other negative terms , such as one - gluon exchange or hyperfine structure , may not be large enough to give the pion a zero mass ( or in other words , to yield csb ) .",
    "[ we have nothing new to say about the rho meson , whose mass we attribute in the standard way to chromomagnetic hyperfine splitting . ]",
    "the second point is that we can find a non - singular euclidean gap equation for the quark running mass @xmath7 , an extension of the johnson - baker - willey ( jbw ) equation @xcite to confining forces , that exemplifies both negative entropic contributions and an effective ir cutoff , coming from the bound on @xmath13 separation .",
    "if we use the standard effective propagator @xmath19 , representing the propagator of a fictitious abelian gluon , well - known ir singularities arise in a standard gap equation .",
    "this is because such a gap equation , with an open quark line , is not invariant with respect to abelian gauge transformations ( having nothing to do with color ) of this fictitious gluon .",
    "we point out that , with the aid of a fictitious heavy  quark \" called @xmath20 , with mass @xmath21 , it is possible to construct a singularity - free abelian gauge - invariant dynamics for quark csb .",
    "this is done by using a regulated effective propagator @xmath22 in the green s function @xmath23|\\rangle$ ] . because @xmath24 has a closed fermion loop it has the abelian gauge invariance that leads to a cancellation of the ir singularities @xcite",
    ", so the @xmath10 limit exists , at least as long as there is a mass gap , that is , that there is csb for the quark .",
    "in such a case gauge invariance gives a natural ir cutoff in the dynamics at a momentum scale @xmath25 .",
    "part of this cancellation of singularities was given long ago @xcite in another closed - loop process , the pion bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "there it was shown that the limit @xmath26 in the sum @xmath27 of the on - shell running quark mass and the static potential based on the regulated effective propagator exists and is finite ; the potential is just @xmath11",
    ". however , any finite terms surviving at @xmath10 were not investigated . in the present work",
    "we show that there is such a finite and negative term in the mass @xmath28 of order @xmath29 that we now identify with an entropic contribution .",
    "such a negative term is essential for producing a zero - mass pion . in the mass - regulated potential considered by itself",
    "there is , at @xmath30 , a negative term @xmath31 .",
    "we see that in the @xmath10 limit , the regulator mass reappears as a term that we can interpret as entropic for a _ finite _ value of @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , finite @xmath4 leads to an ir cutoff of the type we expect , which means that there is no reason to insist on a linearly - rising potential much beyond distances @xmath33 .",
    "the result is a non - singular description of csb using the mass - regulated potential with finite @xmath4 , that yields @xmath34 . with only confining forces",
    ", the uv asymptotic behavior is @xmath35 , but we add one - gluon effects to get the known @xcite renormalization - group ( rg ) behavior , with the additional feature that we can calculate the prefactor from the confining effects .    as a subsidiary point",
    ", we investigate the contributions to csb from a one - dressed - gluon jbw equation . if , as previously argued from this equation @xcite , gluonic effects are not enough for csb , they are still important because they enhance the zero - momentum quark mass @xmath3 and give the dominant effects in the ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "finally , we briefly mention another approach to removing the singularities of confining forces , by using a principal - part propagator in minkowski space .",
    "the effective euclidean propagator ( having nothing to do with the true qcd gluon propagator ! ) that we will use is : @xmath36 with a finite value of @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath10 limit , or @xmath37 , of this effective propagator mimics an area law when used in a world - line action : @xmath38 where the integrals are over closed world lines and @xmath39 indicates a fourier transform .",
    "it is precisely an area law in @xmath40 , where the ( massless gluon ) propagator is @xmath41 , and it yields approximately an area law in @xmath42 .",
    "( for a discussion of how this approximates an area law in @xmath42 see @xcite . )",
    "it is gauge - invariant in the sense that if derivative terms are added to the propagator they contribute nothing to the action , because of the integration over closed loops . for finite @xmath4",
    "this gauge - invariant action does , of course , depend on @xmath4 , but for infinitesimal @xmath4 a small change is an abelian gauge transformation @xcite and this closed - loop action is both independent of @xmath4 and non - singular at @xmath10 .",
    "this choice of massive effective propagator is not unique ; as an example , one might try the two - mass propagator : @xmath43 if both @xmath44 are close to @xmath3 there is little difference from eq .",
    "( [ expreg ] ) .",
    "but if either is very small or very large compared to @xmath3 , either unphysical features appear or csb is absent .",
    "for example , at @xmath45 the two - mass propagator is effectively an attractive coulomb potential with a very strong coupling that has no physical basis .",
    "so we use only the propagator of eq .",
    "( [ expreg ] ) in what follows .",
    "the euclidean jbw equation we use to describe confining effects is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the effective propagator of eq .",
    "( [ expreg ] ) .",
    "it is not hard to see that , just as for the gluonic gap equation @xcite , the confining gap equation for @xmath7 is closely related to the gauge - invariant bethe - salpeter equation for the pion , with confining forces .",
    "recall that the usual derivation of the jbw equation , for gluonic exchange rather than confinement , comes from the schwinger - dyson equation , with zero bare ( current ) mass , for the csb mass term @xmath7 in the quark propagator .",
    "this equation is coupled to the equation for the coefficient of @xmath48 in this propagator and to various vertices related to the propagator by ward identities , and in its full glory the coupled equations are quite complex ( see , for example , a very recent study of the full schwinger - dyson equation for the landau - gauge quark propagator @xcite ) .",
    "extensive use of these ward identities and other tools show @xcite that satisfaction of the full quark self - energy schwinger - dyson equation implies the existence of a zero - mass pion , whose wave function is closely related to the mass function @xmath7 .",
    "the confining jbw equation we use is similar , but with gluonic lines replaced by the effective propagator of eq .",
    "( [ expreg ] ) . for simplicity , and",
    "because further accuracy is not warranted , we consider here ( as many authors do ) only a simplified form of the self - energy equation in which the coefficient of @xmath48 is unity . as with any effective propagator",
    ", we only use it at one - loop level .",
    "in addition to these studies of confinement we briefly explore the usual euclidean jbw equation for one - gluon exchange , but with a massive gluon @xcite .",
    "one reason to do this is to set the stage for techniques used in the confining jbw equation .",
    "another is that within the general framework of the gap equation we use for confinement , but with a one - gluon propagator and running charge rather than the effective confining propagator , it appears that one - dressed - gluon exchange does not yield csb for quarks @xcite , but would do so for adjoint fermions ( coupled more strongly by a factor of 9/4 in qcd ) , as shown in lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "this one - gluon result is based on the non - perturbative generation of a dynamical gluon mass @xcite @xmath49 of about @xmath50 where @xmath51 300 mev is the qcd mass scale .",
    "the main effect of the dynamical mass is to reduce the zero - momentum strong coupling @xmath52 to about 0.4 - 0.5 ( with no quarks ) .",
    "the conclusion that one - gluon csb does not give csb is far from unasssailable , because of approximations in the gap equation itself and possible inaccuracies in the claimed dynamical mass and running charge .",
    "indeed , a preprint that came out as this paper was being written up @xcite , based on an extensive and complicated study of the gap equation in landau gauge and using landau - gauge form factors from lattice simulations as input , claims that inclusion of rather subtle ghost effects does lead to gluonic csb without confinement . as these authors acknowledge , the csb mechanism they find is not very strong , and they also confirm that csb is absent within the approximations of ref .",
    "@xcite , which has no explicit quark - gluon vertex corrections or ghost contributions .    in our opinion",
    "the fate of gluonic csb remains to be determined .",
    "there are lattice simulations @xcite claiming that in @xmath53 lattice gauge theory , confinement by center vortices is both necessary and sufficient for csb , suggesting that standard gluonic effects are not the csb driving mechanism .",
    "there are also simulations ( for example , @xcite ) showing that the csb phase transition temperature is quite close ( not necessarily identical ) to the deconfinement phase transition temperature .",
    "another recent preprint @xcite muddies the waters further , claiming that in @xmath54 lattice - gauge simulations removal of center vortices removes confinement but not csb , contradicting the @xmath53 simulation results of @xcite .",
    "we do not know how this puzzle will be resolved . in order to be consistent",
    "we continue to use the one - gluon gap equation of ref .",
    "@xcite , and add it to the confining gap equation to recover known @xcite renormalization group ( rg ) and operator - product results in the deep uv , which are that @xmath55^{a-1}/p^2 $ ] ( here @xmath56 is the lane @xcite constant ) for a constant undetermined by the rg or ope that is proportional to @xmath9 . in our combination of confinement and one - gluon effects",
    "we can estimate the unknown constant .",
    "there is another way of treating @xmath4 as a regulator , at least in minkowski space .",
    "this is to define the effective propagator analogous to eq .",
    "( [ expreg ] ) as a principal - part propagator , which has two important effects .",
    "the first is that it makes the quark action of eq .",
    "( [ confact ] ) real for any @xmath4 ; there is no good physical interpretation of an imaginary part of this action .",
    "the second effect is that use of a principal - part effective propagator leads to an integrability condition that allows for the limit @xmath10 .",
    "we save a detailed investigation of this propagator , and its extension to euclidean space , for a later paper . however , it is important to point out that the principal - part effective propagator obeys a simple condition , called the integrability condition , which is that the spacetime integral of the confining effective propagator @xmath57 is a finite dimensionless constant independent of any regulation scheme used to define the effective propagator .",
    "this real propagator is half the sum of the advanced and the retarded propagators , or the wheeler - feynman propagator .",
    "our major claim is that whether one uses technique allowing @xmath4 to be thought of as a true regulator , or whether one identifies a @xmath31 term as a finite entropic contribution in the sort of gap equation we consider here , proper choice of @xmath4 will lead to correct csb predictions from such a gap equation .",
    "section [ gisec ] shows how to extract the jbw equation from the green s function @xmath24 .",
    "section [ lqarealaw ] develops the entropic argument , basically that configurations of a wilson loop with massless quarks heavily favor highly - ramified structures with pion branches , rather than configurations where the @xmath14 and @xmath15 can separate by large distances ( which would be allowed , in principle , in the quenched approximation where confining strings can not break ) .",

    "this term , which is negative and @xmath60 , is crucial to find a massless pion given that naive confinement contains only the positive area - law potential and kinetic energy ; we identify it with entropic contributions .",

    "section [ arealaw ] introduces the integrability condition for removing singularities of a confining effective propagator in minkowski space .",
    "we argue that it is possible to extract a jbw gap equation from an abelian gauge - invariant amplitude that is non - singular and that has all the physical effects ( entropy , ir cutoff ) represented with reasonable quantitative accuracy .",
    "this extraction is in somewhat the spirit of the pinch technique @xcite , in which ( color- ) gauge - invariant green s functions are extracted from some gauge - invariant object such as the s - matrix .",

    "one can show either by direct calculation of graphs or by using the techniques of @xcite that such a gauge - invariant color - singlet amplitude is of the form : @xmath63 whatever the value of @xmath4 , @xmath64 is gauge invariant and conserved : @xmath65 .",
    "a mass gap plus conservation imply that @xmath64 must vanish at @xmath66 , and so the @xmath10 singularities cancel in the sum of all potentials and masses .",
    "the jbw gap equation comes from dropping all terms referring to the field @xmath20 in the sum of graphs , after cancellation of gauge artifacts .",
    "note that in practice if one uses the gauge - invariant description of csb through the green s function @xmath24 little is lost by keeping a finite @xmath4 , provided that @xmath67 , simply because smaller momenta are cut off .",

    "note that going backwards in time is not at all hindered , so that there is no bar to forming a non - zero value of @xmath86 .",
    "a typical configuration will have an overall length @xmath87 , but any particular branch will have a separation between the @xmath14 line and the @xmath15 line of @xmath88 . here",
    "the correlation length @xmath89 is related to the csb - generated constituent quark mass @xmath90 by @xmath91 ( see , for example , an elementary discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "so the area of the wilson loop is @xmath92 . in terms of the overall length @xmath93",

    "the upshot of this discussion is that when @xmath94 , pionic wilson - loop configurations that look sheet - like ( that is , for some @xmath13 separation @xmath77 that is large compared to @xmath95 ) are highly suppressed .",
    "this is because the available configurational entropy of the flux sheets can not overcome the action penalty in the exponentially - small area law contribution to the wilson loop vev .",
    "but because the action penalty for forming pions from light quarks is small , entropy can dominate .",

    "the wilson loop will ramify until the two terms are approaching equality , at which point other physical effects take over .    even though rho mesons ( for example ) are made of virtually massless quarks , they are heavy in part because of qcd hyperfine interactions to the point that their fluctuation entropy can not overcome their action . a standard estimate of hyperfine splitting is : @xmath101 which is about 700 mev for parameters that we use in this paper .",
    "for purposes of the following heuristic discussion , we assume that one - gluon effects are too weak to produce csb by themselves , and omit writing them .",
    "a long - standing problem of csb via confinement is that a linearly - rising potential such as @xmath11 is positive ; when added to the positive kinetic energy of the quarks , how can one get a zero pion mass bound state ?",
    "the answer is the negative entropic contributions of the last section .",
    "we saw there that the effective confining propagator of eq .",
    "( [ expreg ] ) has such a term , although there was no explicit reference to entropy .",

    "let us accept these pt results , although the final word has yet to be said on their quantitative accuracy , and ask what they have to say about one - gluon csb .",
    "recently the author argued @xcite that the gluon mass and relatively small coupling were , in fact , too small for quark csb via the gluon - exchange jbw mechanism , and confinement had to be the main source of csb , as we now review .",

    "it turns out that accounting for a gluon mass does two things : 1 ) it makes the gap equation finite at zero momentum ; 2 ) and more important , it bounds the ir running coupling .",

    "this is somewhat smaller than the commonly - quoted value of 300 mev , which is largely based on not on true dynamical estimates but on assuming that the sum of quark masses represents most of the mass of the hadron in question .",
