    "according to modern cosmology , dark matter corresponds to @xmath8 of the total cosmological density , is nonbaryonic and consists of new stable particles . such particles ( see @xcite for reviews and references ) should be stable , provide the measured dark - matter density and be decoupled from plasma and radiation at least before the beginning of the matter - dominated era .",
    "it was recently shown that heavy stable particles of charge @xmath0 , @xmath1 , bound to primordial helium in ohe atoms , can provide an interesting explanation for cosmological dark matter @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the nuclear cross section of the o - helium interaction with matter escapes the severe constraints @xcite on strongly - interacting dark - matter particles ( simps)@xcite imposed by the xqc experiment@xcite .    the hypothesis of composite o - helium dark matter , first considered to provide a solution to the puzzles of direct dark - matter searches , can offer an explanation for another puzzle of modern astrophysics@xcite :",
    "this composite - dark - matter model can explain the excess of gamma radiation in the electron- positron annihilation line , observed by integral in the galactic bulge ( see @xcite for a review and references ) . the explanation assumes that ohe provides all the galactic dark matter and that its collisions in the central part of the galaxy result in 2s - level excitations of ohe which are de - excited to the ground state by an e0 transition , in which an electron - positron pair is emitted .",
    "if the 2s level is excited , pair production dominates over the two - photon channel in the de - excitation , because electrons are much lighter than helium nuclei , and positron production is not accompanied by a strong gamma - ray signal .",
    "according to@xcite the rate of positron production @xmath9 is sufficient to explain the excess in the positron annihilation line from the bulge measured by integral . in the present paper",
    "we study the process of 2s - level excitation of ohe from collisions in the galactic bulge and determine the conditions under which such collisions can provide the observed excess .",
    "inelastic interactions of o - helium with matter in interstellar space and subsequent de - excitation can give rise to radiation in the range from a few kev to a few mev . in the galactic bulge with radius @xmath10",
    "the number density of o - helium can be of the order of @xmath11 or larger , and the collision rate of o - helium in this central region was estimated in @xcite : @xmath12 , with @xmath13 tev . at the velocity of @xmath14 energy transfer in such collisions is @xmath15 .",
    "these collisions can lead to excitation of o - helium .",
    "if @xmath16 levels with nonzero angular momentum are excited , gamma lines should be observed from transitions ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 ( or from similar transitions corresponding to the case @xmath19 ) at the level @xmath20 ster@xmath21 .",
    "the studied reaction is the collision between two incident ohe atoms in their ground states @xmath22 giving rise to an ohe in an excited @xmath23-state @xmath24 while the other one remains in its ground state : @xmath25    if we work in the rest frame of the ohe that gets excited , and if we neglect its recoil after the collision , the differential cross section of the process is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass of ohe , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the momenta of the incident ohe before and after the collision , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the ground - state and excited - state energies of the target ohe and @xmath32 is the interaction potential between the incident and the target ohe s .",
    "we shall neglect the internal structure of the incident ohe , so that its wave functions are plane waves .",
    "@xmath33 is normalized to obtain a unit incident current density and the normalisation of @xmath34 is chosen for it to be pointlike , i.e. the fourier transform of @xmath35  @xcite:@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the position vector of the incident ohe and @xmath38 .    in the following",
    ", we shall be lead to considering @xmath1 masses which are much larger than the mass of helium or the bound state energies .",
    "therefore , the origin of the rest frame of the target ohe coincides with the position of its @xmath1 component and its reduced mass @xmath39 can be taken as the mass of helium @xmath40 .",
    "the ohe that gets excited is described as a hydrogenoid atom , with energy levels @xmath41 and initial and final bound - state wave functions @xmath42 , @xmath43 of a hydrogenoid atom with a bohr radius @xmath44 .    the incident ohe interacts with the @xmath1 and helium components in the target ohe , so that the interaction potential @xmath32 is the sum of the two contributions @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the position vector of the helium component .",
    "the first term @xmath45 gives a zero contribution to the integral of expression since the states @xmath42 and @xmath43 are orthogonal .",
    "for the second term , we treat the incident ohe as a heavy neutron colliding on a helium nucleus through short - range nuclear forces .",
    "the interaction potential can then be written in the form of a contact term : @xmath49 where we have normalised the delta function to obtain an ohe - helium elastic cross section equal to @xmath50 .",
    "going to spherical coordinates for @xmath29 and integrating over @xmath51 in the differential cross section , together with the previous expressions , and , we get @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the transferred momentum and @xmath54 is the solid angle . from the integration over the delta function in ,",
    "we have obtained the conservation of energy during the process : p^2=p^2 + 2m(e_1s - e_ns).[eq : pp]it leads to the threshold energy corresponding to @xmath55 and to a minimum incident velocity @xmath56 .",
    "the previous expression for @xmath57 allows us to express the squared modulus of @xmath58 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the deviation angle of the incident ohe with respect to the collision axis in the rest frame of the target ohe .",
    "@xmath61 pairs will be dominantly produced if ohe is excited to a @xmath2 state , since the only de - excitation channel is in this case from @xmath2 to @xmath22 .",
    "as @xmath61 pair production is the only possible channel , the differential pair production cross section @xmath62 is equal to the differential collisional excitation cross section . by particularizing expression to the case @xmath63",
    ", one finally gets @xmath64",
    "the total @xmath61 pair production rate in the galactic bulge is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the volume of the galactic bulge , which is a sphere of radius @xmath67 kpc , @xmath68 is the energy density distribution of dark matter in the galactic halo and @xmath69 is the pair production cross section @xmath70 times relative velocity @xmath71 averaged over the velocity distribution of dark matter particles . the total pair - production cross section @xmath70 is obtained by integrating over the diffusion angle .",
    "its dependence on the relative velocity @xmath71 is contained in @xmath72 , @xmath57 and @xmath73 through @xmath74 and the expressions ( [ eq : pp ] ) and ( [ eq : q2 ] ) of @xmath57 and @xmath73 in terms of @xmath72 .",
    "we use a burkert  @xcite flat , cored , dark matter density profile known to reproduce well the kinematics of disk systems in massive spiral galaxies and supported by recent simulations including supernova feedback and radiation pressure of massive stars  @xcite in response to the cuspy halo problem : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the distance from the galactic center .",
    "the central dark matter density @xmath77 is left as a free parameter and @xmath78 is determined by requiring that the local dark matter density at @xmath79 kpc is @xmath80 gev / cm@xmath6 . the dark matter mass enclosed in a sphere of radius @xmath76",
    "is therefore given by @xmath82    for the baryons in the bulge , we use an exponential profile @xcite of the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 m@xmath85 @xcite is the mass of the bulge .",
    "this gives the baryonic mass distribution in the galactic bulge @xmath86    we assume a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution for the dark matter particles of the galactic halo , with a velocity dispersion @xmath87 and a cutoff at the galactic escape velocity @xmath88 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the velocity of the dark matter particles in the frame of the halo and    @xmath91 is a normalization constant such that @xmath92 .    the radial dependence of the velocity dispersion is obtained via the virial theorem : @xmath93 where @xmath94 , while @xmath95 .",
    "using the velocity distribution , going to center - of - mass and relative velocities @xmath96 and @xmath97 and performing the integrals over @xmath96 , we obtain for the mean pair - production cross section times relative velocity : @xmath98 which is also a function of @xmath76 through @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "putting , , , , and together allows us to compute the pair production rate in the galactic bulge defined in as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath27 .",
    "( gev / cm@xmath6 ) and of the ohe mass @xmath27 ( tev ) reproducing the excess of @xmath61 pairs production in the galactic bulge . below the red curve ,",
    "the predicted rate is too low . ]",
    "the rate of excessive @xmath61 pairs to be generated in the galactic bulge was estimated in @xcite to be @xmath101 s@xmath102 we computed @xmath103 for a large range of central dark - matter densities , going from @xmath104 gev / cm@xmath6 to a ultimate upper limit of @xmath105 gev / cm@xmath6 @xcite . for each value of @xmath77 , we searched for the mass @xmath27 of ohe that reproduces the observed rate .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ flo : rho0_mohe ] .",
    "the observed rate can be reproduced from a value of @xmath106 gev / cm@xmath6 , corresponding to an ohe mass of @xmath107 tev . as @xmath77 gets larger , two values of @xmath27",
    "are possible , the lower one going from @xmath108 tev to @xmath109 gev and the upper one going from @xmath108 to @xmath109 tev as @xmath77 goes from @xmath110 to @xmath105 gev / cm@xmath6 .",
    "the existence of heavy stable particles is one of the most popular solutions for the dark matter problem .",
    "usually they are considered to be electrically neutral . but dark matter can potentially be made of stable heavy charged particles bound in neutral atom - like states by coulomb attraction .",
    "an analysis of the cosmological data and of the atomic composition of the universe forces the particle to have charge @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 is then trapped by primordial helium in neutral o - helium states and this avoids the problem of overproduction of anomalous isotopes , which are severely constrained by observations .",
    "here we have shown that the cosmological model of o - helium dark matter can explain the puzzle of positron line emission from the center of our galaxy .",
    "the proposed explanation is based on the assumption that ohe dominates the dark - matter sector .",
    "its collisions can lead to e0 de - excitations of the 2s states excited by the collisions .",
    "the estimated luminosity in the electron - positron annihilation line strongly depends not only on the mass of @xmath1 , but also on the density profile and velocity distribution of dark matter in the galactic bulge .",
    "note that the density profile we considered is used only to obtain a reasonable estimate for the uncertainties on the density in the bulge .",
    "it indeed underestimates the mass of the galaxy , but it shows that the uncertainties on the astrophysical parameters are large enough to reproduce the observed excess for a rather wide range of masses of @xmath1 . for a fixed density profile and a fixed velocity distribution , only two values of the @xmath1 mass lead to the necessary rate of positron production .",
    "the lower value of this mass , which does nt exceed @xmath108 tev , is within the reach of experimental searches for multi charged stable heavy particles at the lhc .",
