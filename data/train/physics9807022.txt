    "at the moment the most promising theories of the pulsar radio emission generation are based on the plasma emission model , in which the high brightness radio emission is generated by plasma instabilities developing in the outflowing plasma ( @xcite ) . to find the instability that can be responsible for the generation of pulsar radio emission it is essential to know the dispersion relations of the normal modes of the medium and take into account the evolution of the modes as they propagate outward in the pulsar magnetosphere .    in a standard model of pulsar magnetospheres",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) rotating , strongly magnetized neutron stars induce strong electric fields that pull the charges from their surfaces . inside the closed field lines of the neutron star magnetosphere , a steady charge distribution established , compensating the induced electric field . on the open field lines , the neutron star generates a dense flow of relativistic electron - positron pairs penetrated by a highly relativistic electron or positron beam .",
    "this relativistic flow generates the observed pulsar radio emission .",
    "first , we present a consideration of the properties of linear waves in a strongly magnetized electron - positron plasma with similar distributions of electrons and positron .",
    "we take into account possible relativistic temperatures of plasma component .",
    "the particles are assumed to be in their ground gyrational state so that the plasma is one - dimensional",
    ". properties of a one - dimensional pair plasma are considerably different from the properties of a well studied electron - ion plasma .",
    "previously , @xcite investigated the dispersion relations in a one - dimensional plasma with a power law distribution of the particles , @xcite considered waves in a cold plasma and in a warm plasma using a water bag distribution . for the propagation of the coupled o - alfven modes ,",
    "@xcite considered the case of infinitely strong magnetic field and found that the o branch is always superluminous and thus can not be excited by the cherenkov mechanism . on the other hand , @xcite took into account finite magnetic field and found that the o wave becomes subluminous for large wave numbers allowing cherenkov excitation . @xcite",
    "considered the waves in pair plasma taking into account the relative motion of electrons and positrons .",
    "@xcite used a fluid theory to consider waves in a _",
    "nonrelativistic _ three - dimensional pair plasma . in our approach",
    "we use relativistic kinetic theory assuming that the possible resonant and nonresonant contributions from the beam particles may be considered as perturbations to the initial plasma state .",
    "we resort to similar distributions of the pair plasma with equal densities and neglect the curvature of the magnetic field lines .",
    "these approximations require some justifications .",
    "first , the pulsar plasma is nonneutral due to the presence of the primary beam .",
    "we neglect the nonneutrality of plasma since the density of plasma @xmath0 is thought to be much larger than the goldreich - julian density @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is a rotational frequency of the neutron star , @xmath4 is a charge of a particle , @xmath5 is magnetic field , @xmath6 is a speed of light , @xmath7 is the multiplicity factor ) .",
    "secondly , the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field results in a curvature drift of the particles perpendicular to the osculating plane .",
    "it can be shown that for the typical parameters in the pulsar magnetosphere the drift velocity of plasma particles due to the curvature of magnetic field lines could be neglected in the calculations of the real part of the dielectric tensor unless the curvature of field lines @xmath8 satisfies the condition @xmath9 ( here @xmath10 is the average streaming energy of plasma particles in the pulsar frame and @xmath11 ia a larmor radius ) .",
    "this follows from the assumption of a nonrelativistic transverse motion and the transformation of the radius of curvature seen in the center of gyration frame @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the radius of curvature in the pulsar frame , @xmath14 is the lorentz factor of the particle ) .",
    "this condition is well satisfied inside the pulsar magnetosphere for the plasma streaming energy @xmath15 .",
    "by contrast , the drift velocity may be very important for the high energy resonant particles .    in this paper",
    "we consider wave excitation in a strongly magnetized pair plasma in the approximation of _ straight _ magnetic field lines , thus omitting an important cherenkov - drift resonance ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is an important mechanism that may be responsible for the generation of the cone type emission in pulsars .",
    "the electromagnetic cherenkov - drift instability occurs in the kinetic regime on the high frequency vacuum - like o and x waves .",
    "it has the same advantages as the electromagnetic cyclotron instabilities considered in this paper .    in presenting our results we were trying to find a balance between providing an exact general relation and finding a simple useful analytical approximation , which gives an idea of how modes behave in different regimes .",
    "several approximations will be extensively used . for the case of radio waves propagating in the pulsar magnetosphere",
    "there is naturally a small parameter , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is a frequency of a wave ) , so that in many cases complicated dispersion relations and polarization properties can be simplified by expanding in this parameter .",
    "when making such expansion one should be especially careful near the points where dispersion curves almost intersect ( eq .",
    "[ tte ] ) .",
    "a formal expansion in @xmath16 diverges near the intersection point . in this case , since the intersection formally occurs only for the parallel propagation , the relevant small parameter is the angle of propagation with respect to magnetic field .",
    "another simplification that we will often use , is the expansion in a ratio of the plasma frequency @xmath18 to the cyclotron frequency @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is a mass of a particle ) @xmath21 .",
    "this is a good approximation for the most parts of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the main conlusions of our work are the following .",
    "for the chosen parameters of the magnetosphere plasma , the cherenkov - type electrostatic beam instabilities develop in a hydrodynamic regime , while cyclotron - type electromagnetic instabilities develop in a kinetic regime .",
    "electrostatic beam instabilities in the pulsar plasma are generally weaker than the electromagnetic instabilities .",
    "in addition , cherenkov instabilities have largest growth rate near the stellar surface , where the cherenkov resonance can occurs _ only _ on the alfvn mode . however , this mode _ can not _ escape to infinity , even though it has some electromagnetic component .",
    "another factor that limits the development of the cherenkov - type instabilities is that they grow within a much narrower angles than cyclotron instabilities . in a curved magnetic field",
    "this results in a shorter length of the coherent wave - particle interaction .",
    "the relative weakness of electrostatic instabilities as compared to electromagnetic instabilities is an unusual characteristics of the strongly relativistic beams .",
    "the reason is that for the particles in the primary beam , which contribute to the development of the instability , the effective parallel mass is @xmath22 .",
    "this suppresses the development of the electrostatic instabilities .",
    "in contrast , the effective transverse mass , @xmath23 , is less affected by the large parallel momentum . the electromagnetic instabilities",
    "are less suppressed by the large streaming momenta .",
    "thus , the relativistic velocities and one - dimensionality of the distribution function result in a strong suppression of the electrostatic instabilities as compared to electromagnetic instabilities .",
    "the calculations presented here provided a basis for the model of pulsar radio emission presented in @xcite .",
    "to a large extent a possible mechanism for the generation of pulsar radio emission is predicated on the choice of parameters of the plasma flow that is generated by a rotating neutron star . at this point we know only the general features of the distribution function of the particles in a pulsar magnetosphere ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is believed to comprise ( see fig .",
    "[ distributionfunction ] ) ( i ) a highly relativistic primary beam with the lorentz factor @xmath24 and density equal to the goldreich - julian density @xmath25 , ( ii ) a secondary electron positron plasma with a bulk streaming lorentz factor @xmath26 , a similar scatter in energy @xmath27 and a density much larger than the beam density @xmath28 , ( iii ) a tail of plasma distribution with the energy up to @xmath29 .",

    "secondary pairs are born with almost the same energy in the avalanche - like process above in the polar cap ( @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of the pair plasma and primary beam is expected to screen the rotationally induced electric field so that the flow is force - free .",
    "another relation between the parameters of the plasma and the beam comes from the energy argument that the primary particles stop producing the pairs when the energy in the pair plasma becomes equal to the energy in the primary beam : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the initial average energies and densities of pair plasma , @xmath35 is the energy of the beam in the pulsar frame and @xmath36 is the density of the beam .",

    "what follows , the quantities measured in the pulsar frame will be denoted with a prime .",
    "the relations between plasma parameters measured in the pulsar and plasma frames are @xmath41    in this paper we neglect the difference of energies of secondary plasma components which arises as the flow propagates outward in curved magnetic field lines . for the consideration of the effects of relative velocity on the wave dispersion see @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the physics of the pair formation front forces us to allow for a broad range of plasma parameters .",
    "accordingly , the growth rates of the particular instabilities can vary considerably depending on the assumed parameters .",
    "the numerical estimates will be given for a typical pulsar with the period p= 0.5 s ( light cylinder radius @xmath42 cm ) , and the surface magnetic field @xmath43 and the primary beam lorentz factor @xmath44 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these assumptions and the equation ( [ vg ] ) reduce the number of free parameters to two : plasma temperature and the bulk streaming energy @xmath10 ( or temperature and the multiplicity factor @xmath7 ) . consequently , we will consider two separate cases of cold and relativistically hot plasma . for numerical estimates we will use the following fiducial numbers",

    "the radial dependence of the parameters is assumed to follow the dipole geometry of the magnetic field : @xmath51",
    "in the limits of applicability of our simplifying assumptions , the dielectric tensor is ( @xcite ) @xmath52 here @xmath53 where @xmath54 are one dimensional distribution functions of the components @xmath31 , @xmath55 is a velocity along the local magnetic field , @xmath14 is a lorentz factor of a particle , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the corresponding components of the wave vector and magnetic field is directed along the @xmath59 axis .    for stationary and spatially uniform plasma",

    "this condition has to be put in by hand .",
    "whenever the phase speed of the wave becomes comparable to the thermal velocity the waves should be considered strongly damped and nonexistent .",
    "therefore , we expect that the high frequency branch of the alfvn wave , which in the limit of cold plasma had a very low phase velocity , will be strongly damped .    here",
    ", we should also mention a long standing controversy [ controversy ] about the dispersion of the longitudinal waves and the possibility of the two stream instabilities in the relativistic plasma . in the initial work ( @xcite ) and",
