    "if complete congestion on one outgoing link completely blocks access to all other outgoing links , we say the model is a _ full fifo _ model .    whether a node model of a diverging junction is fifo or non - fifo affects the qualitative dynamical behavior of traffic flow through the junction",

    ".    however , non - fifo models and full fifo models are often inadequate .",
    "non - fifo models imply that , even if one of the output links is jammed , the resulting traffic spillback has no effect on those vehicles directed to the other output links , an unreasonable assumption as the fifo effect in traffic flow networks has been observed even for multilane diverging junctions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a full fifo model is often too restrictive  @xcite . to derive a class of _ partial _ fifo models ,  @xcite and",
    "@xcite have suggested modeling lanes of an input link as separate links .",
    "the main drawback of this approach is that it greatly complicates the size and dimensionality of the model since every node in the network becomes a multi - input - multi - output junction .    here ,",

    "junction models where the full fifo rule is relaxed ; see figure [ fig : div ] .",
    "we show that the resulting dynamics are mixed monotone , and we use mixed monotonicity to establish convergence to an equilibrium point of the resulting dynamics . by considering the dynamical properties of fifo traffic flow models that are not full fifo , this paper bridges an important gap in the literature .    in section [ sec : network - flow - model ] , we present a general model of traffic flow that encompasses many existing non - fifo and full fifo models and allows for a large class of partial fifo models . in section [ sec : mixed - monot - traff ] , we show that our general model is mixed monotone . in section [ sec : examples ] , we present several specific , practically motivated instantiations of this general model .",
