    "in the core accretion model of planet formation , at the earliest stages of giant planet formation , the planet is fully embedded in the gaseous disc that orbits the central star @xcite . at later stages , during run - away - gas accretion , tidal forces due to the planet open a gap in the disc , typically when the planet reaches a mass of order neptune s mass @xcite .",
    "the gap opening does not necessarily imply that the gas flow on to the planet has ceased @xcite .",
    "the gap structure is determined by the properties of dynamical flow within it . the relatively low density of gas in the gap results from the relatively high flow radial velocities towards the star as a consequence of the disturbance caused by the planet . outside the gap region ,",
    "the gas radial drift occurs on the much slower viscous timescale , resulting in much higher densities than occur in the gap .",
    "some studies suggest that most of the inflowing gas just outside the gap is accreted by a planet whose mass is comparable to or less than jupiter s for typical disc parameters @xcite .    during this gap phase ,",
    "the planetary radius is typically much smaller than its hill ( tidal ) radius .",
    "circumplanetary discs may form as gas flowing through the gap on to a planet carries some angular momentum about the planet @xcite . as a result , the inflowing gas has too much angular momentum to directly strike the planet and instead forms a disc about it .",
    "most of the mass of jupiter may have been acquired in the gap stage through gas flow that involves a circumplanetary disc",
    ".    there are at least two motivations for studying circumplanetary discs .",
    "the observational detection of a disc orbiting an extra - solar gas giant planet would provide important evidence about the process of planet formation .",
    "the determination of their expected properties provides constraints for their detection .",
    "a second motivation is to better understand satellite formation , since circumplanetary discs are likely sites of satellite formation .",
    "satellites that orbit jupiter and saturn are classified into two groups .",
    "the regular satellites have low eccentricity and low orbital inclination to the equatorial plane of their planet .",
    "they are thought to have formed in the circumplanetary disc @xcite .",
    "the second type , the irregular satellites , can have a high eccentricity and high orbital inclinations .",
    "they can orbit either progradely or retrogradely with respect to the planet spin @xcite .",
    "the circumplanetary disc may capture these satellites though gas drag @xcite , although the disc does not play such a role in the nice model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the circumplanetary accretion disc plays a vital role in satellite formation .",
    "the regular satellite systems of jupiter and saturn extend over a small fraction of their respective hill radii , to less than @xmath4 .",
    "this fact has motivated a dynamical explanation in terms of circumplanetary disc sizes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we discuss this in more detail in section 8 .",
    "previous studies have considered the role of the angular momentum ( about the planet ) of the inflowing gas in determining the disc structure , in particular the disc outer radius .",
    "this picture has some intuitive appeal , since no disc would form , i.e. , the disc radius would be zero , if the inflowing gas has zero angular momentum .",
    "@xcite suggested that after the planet has opened a gap , the circumplanetary disc extends to @xmath5 .",
    "this result is based on the initial angular momentum of gas whose flow relative to the planet is slow near the planet s hill sphere and subsequently accelerates inward towards the planet while conserving its angular momentum about the planet . @xcite and",
    "@xcite considered cases where the angular momentum of the inflowing gas is considerably smaller .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggested that the circumplanetary disc structure prior to or during gap opening could account for the location of regular satellites .",
    "this model was also based on the concept that the disc structure is determined by the angular momentum of infalling gas about the planet , with an implied smaller value of disc radius of @xmath6 .",
    "this paper concentrates on the former case , the case of a circumplanetary disc in the presence of gap opening .",
    "the results of this paper may also apply to this case .",
    "we briefly discuss this point again below equation ( [ hr ] ) and in section [ concs ] .",
    "this radius characteristic of the angular momentum of the accreting gas is useful for providing an estimate of the conditions required for circumplanetary disc formation . for a disc to form about a planet with a gap",
    ", the planetary radius must be smaller than this value .",
    "violating this constraint for disc formation would require very short orbital periods , of order @xmath7 , for a planet of jupiter s radius .    however , it is not clear that this radius characteristic of the angular momentum of the accreting gas is important for determining the disc radius or even has much influence of the disc structure .",
    "the reason has to do with the requirements of angular momentum loss from a steady - state disc .",
    "the process of angular momentum transport in circumplanetary discs has up to now been largely ignored .",
    "the work by @xcite and @xcite did consider the angular momentum issue , as will be discussed further in section 6.5 .",
    "@xcite briefly discuss the possible role of resonances in truncating the disc .",
    "for the disc to accrete in a steady - state manner , gas within it must continuously lose angular momentum .",
    "these studies recognized that the disc would extend beyond the radius in which mass is injected in order to account for the requirements of angular momentum conservation .",
    "the angular momentum issue has been previously encountered in the case of discs in mass exchange binary star systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the inflowing gas from the mass losing star is captured within the roche lobe of the companion star .",
    "this gas has some angular momentum that often results in the formation of disc about the companion .",
    "the picture that has resulted is that the disc spreads outward by viscous torques until it reaches a radius at which tidal torques from the companion are sufficient to remove the angular momentum at the rate required for steady state accretion .",
    "the disc structure is insensitive to the angular momentum of the accreting gas .",
    "the case of a planet accreting gas can be considered to be a binary of extreme mass ratio .",
    "the accretion disc model in the binary star case suggests a somewhat different picture of how the accretion process operates than has been previously considered for circumplanetary discs .",
    "we consider the accretion disc model of circumplanetary discs in this paper .",
    "some recent three - dimensional simulations have analysed the flow in circumplanetary discs .",
    "for example , @xcite simulated gas accretion by protoplanets in three - dimensions with gas self - gravity and radiation transfer to investigate the properties of circumplanetary discs .",
    "they determined the disc scale height to be @xmath8 and found the disc size to be about @xmath9 .",
    "they attributed this value of the disc radius as following from the estimate of @xcite , for which the radius is determined by the angular momentum of the accreting gas .",
    "@xcite also performed three - dimensional calculations of circumplanetary discs . for a jupiter mass planet , he found a peak in the surface density at about 21 protoplanetary radii ( or @xmath10 ) from the protoplanet centre . according to these results ,",
    "the peak is due to the balance between the centrifugal force and the gravity of the protoplanet .",
    "such small scale features might then correspond to the formation sites of the regular satellites around jupiter and saturn .",
    "however , this peak in the surface density was not reproduced by @xcite who found that the surface density decreases monotonically with radius from the protoplanet .",
    "we analyse the general properties of circumplanetary discs by the use of some simplified models , in order to understand the physical processes that affect disc structure . in section  [ properties ] , we estimate the scale height and temperature of the disc . in section  [ test ]",
    "we consider a ballistic disc model consisting of periodic particle orbits around a planet . in section  [ eqs ]",
    "we examine the circumplanetary fluid disc evolution equations in the hill approximation and discuss their relationship to the binary star case . in section  [ res ]",
    "we consider whether resonances could lie within a circumplanetary disc . in section  [ tidal ] , we analyse the effects of a tidal torque on a purely viscous disc . in section  [ sph ]",
    "we describe results of a model that includes the effects of gas pressure by means of some sph simulations .",
    "section  [ concs ] contains a discussion and the conclusions .",
    "we consider a system with a planet of mass @xmath11 in a circular orbit around a star of mass @xmath12 at a separation @xmath13 .",
    "the hill sphere is the approximate region where the planet s gravity dominates that of the star and its radius is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the sound speed in an ideal gas is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath18 is the temperature , @xmath19 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath20 is the mass of a hydrogen atom .",
    "the surface temperature of a steady state accretion disc around an object of mass @xmath21 at a radius @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 @xcite where @xmath24 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "we estimate the temperature of the accreting gas with the disc .",
    "similar approaches were taken by @xcite .",
    "consider a disc orbiting a solar mass star that is accreting gas at a rate of @xmath25 , a typical value inferred from observations of t tauri stars .",
    "equation  [ temp ] implies that at a distance from the central star of @xmath26 the disc has a temperature of about @xmath27 , ignoring effects of stellar heating .",
    "this temperature corresponds to a disc aspect ratio @xmath28 .",
    "the aspect ratio of the circumplanetary disc taken with respect to the planet is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass of jupiter and @xmath22 is the distance from the planet .",
    "( there is a small correction due to the vertical gravity of the star that we ignore . )",
    "this aspect ratio is much larger than the value for the circumstellar disc , @xmath31 .",
    "we have taken the disc sound speed @xmath32 to be given by its value at the disc surface and have ignored any increase at the midplane with optical depth .",
    "the relatively high value of @xmath33 is due to the higher gas temperatures and the typically smaller @xmath34 values in the circumplanetary disc case .",
    "the value of the disc aspect ratio from equation ( [ hr ] ) is similar to the values obtained in the simulations by @xcite .",
    "they found no evidence for circumplanetary discs in their simulations of low mass planets ( less than 100 earth masses ) .",
    "they attributed this result to the weakness of the planet s vertical gravity compared to pressure , as can be seen in equation ( [ hr ] ) . for a sufficiently low mass planet",
    ", @xmath35 can be large enough that the concept of a disc breaks down and the gas around the planet is essentially spherical .",
    "as is well known , the circumplanetary disc temperatures at these accretion rates are too high to explain the existence of the icy satellites of jupiter and saturn @xcite . however , in a slower accretion phase as proposed by @xcite and further investigated by @xcite , the temperature would be lower and @xmath36 would be smaller , @xmath37 .",
    "we discuss this further in section  [ concs ] .",
    "we compare the surface density in the circumplanetary disc , @xmath38 , to the surface density in the circumstellar disc , @xmath39 .",
    "we assume that most of the mass being accreted through the circumstellar disc outside the orbit of the planet is accreted by it .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , this efficient gas capture has been found in simulations of jupiter mass planets that orbit solar mass stars .",
    "the mass transfer rate through a steady state disc is given by @xmath40 @xcite , where the viscosity is parametrised with the @xmath41 prescription so that @xmath42 @xcite where @xmath43 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the viscosities in the circumstellar and circumplanetary discs respectively , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 similarly refer the @xmath41 values in the discs .",
    "consider a solar mass star and a jupiter mass planet , @xmath49 , and circumstellar and circumplanetary disc aspect ratios of @xmath50 and 0.3 respectively , as discussed above .",
    "for @xmath51 and equal @xmath41 values ( @xmath52 ) in the above equation , the ratio of the surface densities is @xmath53 .",
    "so the circumplanetary disc surface density is somewhat higher that the local circumstellar disc density .",
    "circumstellar discs could under some circumstances contain dead zones , regions where the disc ionization is too low for the magneto - rotational instability to operate as a source of turbulence ( gammie 1996 ) .",
    "dead zones operate where the temperature is sufficiently low that thermal ionization is weak ( less than about @xmath54 degrees ) and where the surface densities are high enough that external sources of ionization such as cosmic rays do not penetrate far below the disc surface . for expected conditions in a circumstellar disc",
    ", dead zones may extend from a few tenths of an au to several au , in some cases beyond jupiter s orbital radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the model here suggests that the conditions for dead zone formation within a circumplanetary disc are perhaps more favorable than in the nearby circumstellar disc gas .",
    "the reason is that the circumstellar disc surface densities are higher than in the nearby circumstellar disc gas , while the temperatures are low enough to avoid sufficient ionisation in much of the circumplanetary disc .",
    "a difference in the properties of turbulence in the two discs violates our assumption of @xmath52 .",
    "but , it does so in a way that may further enforce the importance of dead zones in the circumplanetary disc .",
    "that is , @xmath55 would be expected to increase , leading to a decrease in @xmath56 we do not pursue the possibility of dead zones further in our disc models described later and assume a simple viscous disc .",
    "the viscous timescale in the disc is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the orbital period of the planet .",
    "so we expect that such discs should be viscously relaxed for jupiter and saturn .",
    "this result has the implication that the viscous disc flow can be regarded to be in a steady state .",
    "a crude estimate of the steady state luminosity ratio of the circumplanetary to circumstellar discs in a system with a jupiter mass planet is @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the planet and star radii , respectively . for @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    ", we estimate @xmath64 to be of order a few percent .",
    "we see that circumplanetary discs are not very bright .",
    "we discuss this further in section  [ concs ] .",
    "in this section we consider ballistic particle orbits in a planet - star system in order to find their nonkeplerian angular velocity and where the orbits begin to cross .      as a simple two - dimensional disc model , we consider ballistic particles orbiting a planet of mass @xmath11 in the corotating frame of the star - planet system with a star of mass @xmath12 .",
    "the particles lie in the star - planet orbit plane .",
    "for such a model to represent a low pressure ( cold ) steady state fluid disc , each orbit must be periodic in the corotating frame and be nonintersecting , either with itself or neighboring orbits , in order that the velocity be single - valued in space .",

    "one is that the disc edge tapering is more gradual than in the thin disc case .",
    "the tapering must be on a scale @xmath318 in order to avoid instabilities that occur for sharper edges ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the tapering can then have an influence on a substantial portion of the circumplanetary disc .",
    "@xcite estimated the disc outer radius based on where the angular momentum per unit disc mass departs from keplerian and begins to decline in radius .",
    "they obtained a disc outer radius of @xmath319 ( see the upper right panel of their fig .",
    "this radius is somewhat inside the orbit crossing radius of @xmath320 .",
    "the effect of the disc tapering on the distribution of disc angular momentum in our sph simulations can be seen in fig .",
    "it leads to subkeplerian velocities inside the orbit crossing radius , similar to the results of @xcite .",
    "the results of these two studies can be further reconciled by considering the differences in the models . in their simulations ,",
    "the disc is hotter than in our simulations .",
    "consequently the pressure forces and their effects on departures from keplerian rotation in the outer parts of the disc should be stronger than in fig .",
    "[ vphi ] , as is consistent with their results .",
    "also the work of @xcite includes the inflowing gas from larger radii that is omitted in our simulations .",
    "this inflowing subkeplerian gas and its interaction with the disc outer edge as it becomes entrained could further modify the results plotted in fig .",
    "it is also possible that the disc radius is affected by the location of wave damping , as discussed below .",
    "such effects should be explored further .",
    "another implication of the high values of @xmath36 is that a small fraction of the disc mass can reside at larger disc radii than the orbit - crossing radius and so be subject to the effects of resonances that lie outside this radius , as discussed in section  [ res ] ( see fig .",
    "[ phase ] ) .",
    "in addition , off - resonant tidal forcing of the outer parts of the disc that lie inside the orbit crossing radius can play an important role .",
    "the resonance width depends on @xmath321 and is not small .",
    "the substantial width can allow the resonant region to overlap with the denser parts of disc . as a result of these two effects ,",
    "two - armed spiral waves can be launched in such discs , even though exact resonances do not lie within the main body of the discs .",
    "we have found evidence of such waves in our sph simulations ( see fig .  [ final ] ) .",
    "for these waves to play a role in extracting angular momentum from the disc , they must damp in order to introduce irreversibility .",
    "otherwise , a standing wave is produced that results in little or no torque on the disc .",
    "some damping can be produced by the disc turbulent viscosity in the fractional amount that is roughly the ratio of the viscous wave damping rate to the wave group propagation rate , about @xmath322 .",
    "this ratio can be quite small for @xmath323 and the torque is reduced to a similarly small fraction of its potentially maximum value . for a thin disc ,",
    "this damping could occur as launched waves propagate , steepen and shock , since their wavelengths are short compared to the disc radius .",
    "but for warm circumplanetary discs , this process is less important because the wavelengths are not short compared to the disc radius . in the sph simulations of section 7 , the damping seems to occur from the strongly nonlinear forcing in the outer disc , similar to the case of mildly warm discs ( @xmath324 previously investigated for binary star systems @xcite .",
    "the sph simulations suggest that the negative torque is produced in the outer parts of the disc , somewhat inside and beyond the radius where nested particle orbits cross or become unstable .",
    "this torque involves a relatively small amount of disc mass ( see fig .",
    "[ phase ] ) .",
    "however , the discs in our sph simulations were two - dimensional and not as warm as could occur , where @xmath151 .",
    "the wave damping issue should be explored in future work .",
    "the accretion disc model does not provide an obvious explanation for the locations of the regular satellites of jupiter and saturn that occur within @xmath4 of the planet . as discussed above",
    ", the disc structure is insensitive to the angular momentum of the inflowing gas and satellites lie well inside the tidal truncation radius of the disc .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the results of recent three - dimensional simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have considered circumplanetary discs with a smoothly varying turbulent viscosity with radius .",
    "but such discs could also harbor dead zones , as discussed in section  [ properties ] .",
    "such situations could result in rapid disc density variations at their boundaries .",
    "the existence of satellites requires survival against the effects of migration .",
    "such density variations could affect satellite migration and possibly trapping satellites , since migration rates depend on density gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but , if the inner dead zone boundary is due to thermal ionisation at a temperature of @xmath325 , then the disc temperatures there would be too hot for the survival of an icy satellite .",
    "of course , other sources of ionisation could change the locations of dead zone edges .",
    "in addition , the nonlinear feedback from waves in a low viscosity disc could slow migration @xcite . however , this slowing is less effective for the warmer circumplanetary discs .",
    "if the satellite formation occurs after partial disc depletion , as suggested by canup & ward ( 2002 ) , then the ionisation through the vertical extent of the disc becomes easier and the dead zones are less likely to occur at that stage .",
    "circumplanetary discs are not very bright as we see in equation  ( [ lum ] ) .",
    "time dependent accretion and outbursts could occur in dead zones , as has been suggested to explain fu orionis outbursts in young stellar systems @xcite . during a circumplanetary disc outburst",
    ", the ratio of the circumplanetary to circumstellar luminosities could be much higher .",
