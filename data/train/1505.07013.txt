    "pulsars are commonly recognized as magnetized neutron stars ( nss ) , sometimes have been argued to be quark stars @xcite . a pulsar s secular spin - down",
    "is mainly caused by its rotational energy losses due to electromagnetic radiation , particle winds , star - disk interaction , intense neutrino emission or gravitational radiation(e.g .",
    ", peng et al . 1982 ; harding et al . 1999 ; alpar & baykal 2006 ; chen & li 2006 ) .",
    "an important and measurable quantity closely related to a pulsar s rotational evolution is the braking index @xmath0 , defined by assuming that the star spins down in the light of a power law @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the angular velocity , @xmath6 is the derivative of @xmath5 , and @xmath7 is a proportionality constant .",
    "when the magneto - dipole radiation ( mdr ) solely causes the pulsar spin - down , the braking index is predicted to be @xmath8 .",
    "note that this constant value of @xmath8 holds only if the torque is proportional to @xmath9 , which is the case for the magnetic torque with @xmath7 keeping constant over time ( blandford & romani 1988 ) .",
    "however , in general @xmath0 can vary over time because variations in any of these quantities may result in departures from this predicted value of 3 .    the standard way to define",
    "the braking index is @xmath10 where @xmath11 the second derivative of @xmath5 , @xmath12 is the spin frequency , and @xmath13 the spin period ( see manchester & taylor 1977 , and references therein ) .",
    "be cautious that the measured value of @xmath0 strongly depends on a certain time - span , and any variation in the braking torque will give a time - varying @xmath14 .",
    "the braking index also reveals some simple physical expectation .",
    "for example , @xmath15 may point to gravitational - wave - emission as the dominant spin - down mechanism , while in the case of @xmath16 , particle - wind radiation may be the cause of the pulsar spin down .    for the majority of pulsars , it is extraordinarily difficult to measure their stable and sensible braking indices @xmath0 , from pulsar timing - fitting by using eq.(2 ) .",
    "the main reason is that the second derivative of @xmath17 is very small and its detection is affected by the rotational irregularities , such as glitches , an abrupt increases in @xmath17 and @xmath18 followed by relaxations(yuan et al .",
    "2010 ) , and timing noise ( zhang & xie 2013 ; kutukcu & ankay 2014 ; haskell & melatos 2015 ) .    by analyzing the timing residuals of 366 non - recycled pulsars over the past 36 yrs , hobbs et al .",
    "( 2010 ) measured their braking indices and showed that they rang from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "unfortunately , the observed @xmath21 for the majority of these pulsars with @xmath22 yrs are dominated by the amount of timing noise present in the residuals and the data span . as noted in pons et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , any small relative variation of the torque will produce large variation in @xmath0 for old pulsars . in general",
    ", timing noise is ubiquitous among pulsars . only for young radio pulsars , which spin down quickly and",
    "have stable first and second spin - period derivatives , their stable and reliable braking indices have been measured ( shown as in table 1 ) , though these sources experience few small or large glitches , the post- glitch recoveries dominate their timing behavior ( hobbs et al .",

    "five magnetars have smaller braking indices , @xmath28 , while the other three have larger braking indices @xmath29 , which imply that neither pure pwr model nor pure mdr model can account for the actual braking of magnetars . in order to investigate the relation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we plot",

    ", we focus on three high braking indices ( @xmath0=32@xmath3810 , 13@xmath384 and 6.3@xmath381.7 for 1e 2259 , 1e 1841 and sgr 0501 , respectively ) . in order to explain why the three magnetars possess large braking indices , we consider the influences of crust magnetic field decay on a magnetar s spin - down , and refer to the works of pons et al ( 2009 ) and vigan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "according to pons et al.(2012 ) , the spin evolution of an isolated ns is dominated by the magnetic field anchored to the star s solid crust , and a varying crustal magnetic field yields the braking index @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the surface dipole magnetic field , @xmath41 is the surface magnetic field at the pole , and @xmath42 is the timescale on which the dipole component of the magnetic field evolves . from eq.(11 ) , a decreasing surface dipole magnetic field , @xmath40 , results in a decaying dipole braking torque , then the effective braking index increases to a high value of @xmath29 .    in order to reconcile the measured high braking indices for three magnetars with their ( estimated ) surface field decaying - rates , it is necessary to introduce the hall induction equation describing the evolution of crust magnetic field in the following form : @xmath43\\times\\vec{b}\\right ] , \\label{12-equation}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the electric conductivity parallel to the magnetic field , @xmath45 is the relativistic redshift correction , @xmath46 is the number of electrons per unit volume , and @xmath47 the electron charge . on the right - hand side ,",
    "the first and second terms account for ohmic dissipation and hall effect ( which redistributes the energy of the crustal magnetic field ) , respectively . as to the above differential equation , aguilara et al .",
    "( 2008 ) presented an analytic solution @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the ohmic dissipation timescale , and @xmath50 is the hall timescale corresponding to an initial surface dipole magnetic field at the pole , @xmath51 . during a ns s",
    "early magneto - thermal evolution stage , corresponding to the crust temperature @xmath52k , the average value of @xmath49 in the crust is about 1 myrs ( pons & gepport 2007 ) .",
    "since both the magnetic field strength and the density vary over many orders of magnitude in nss crusts , the average hall timescale is roughly restricted as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the dipole magnetic field at the pole in units of @xmath55gauss ( pons & gepport 2007 ) .",

    "( 2013 ) presented the updated results of 2d simulations of the ns magneto - thermal evolution , and compared their results with a data sample of 40 sources including magnetars 1e 2259 , 1e 1841 and sgr 0501 .",
    "it was found that by only changing the initial magnetic fields , masses and envelope compositions of the nss , the phenomenological diversity of magnetars , high - b radio - pulsars , and isolated nearby nss can be well explained in their theoretical models .",
    "these sources have best x - ray spectra by @xmath58 or @xmath59-@xmath60 , from which the luminosities and temperatures can be obtained , their well - established associations , and known timing properties with the characteristic age and the alternative estimate for the age .",

    "the hall evolution timescales for the crustal fields have been arbitrarily selected as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69yrs , respectively ( vigan et al . 2013 ) .",
    "3 .   comparing the cooling curves with iron envelopes for @xmath70 gauss , 1e 1841 and sgr 0501 could be born with even higher magnetic field of a few @xmath71gauss , which can provide a strong hard x - ray ( 20@xmath65200kev ) emission with a total luminosity @xmath72erg s@xmath73 ( vigan et al . 2013 ) .",
    "comparing the cooling curves for the group of nss with @xmath74gauss suggests that 1e 2259 may be born with @xmath75gauss , needed to reconcile the observed timing properties and the persistent soft x - ray luminosity .",
    "according to the above arguments , we assume @xmath76gauss for 1e 1841 and sgr 0501 , and @xmath77gauss for 1e 2259 . inserting the values of @xmath51 , @xmath78 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 into eq.(13 )",
    ", we can obtain the estimated values of the surface magnetic field decay - rates @xmath79 . by solving eq.(13 ) ,",
    "we obtain the relation of @xmath79 and the field evolution timescale @xmath80 for the three magnetars , as shown in fig .",
    "2 .    from fig.2",
    ", @xmath79 decreases with increasing @xmath80 . due to the smallest value of @xmath81 , the values of @xmath82 for 1e 2259 are lower than those of the other two magnetars . assuming @xmath83 ( vigan et al .",
    "2013 ) , the current values of @xmath79 of three magnetars are calculated as follows : @xmath84gaussyr@xmath73 for 1e 1841 , @xmath85gaussyr@xmath73 for sgr 0501 , and @xmath86gaussyr@xmath73 for 1e 2259 .",
    "sgr 0501 has the largest value of @xmath79 because it has the smallest age @xmath87 kyrs .",
    "thus , the values of timescale @xmath88 can also be estimated as follows : for 1e 1841 , @xmath89 kyrs , corresponding to @xmath87kyrs , for sgr 0501 , @xmath90 kyrs , corresponding to @xmath91kyrs , and for 1e 2259 , @xmath92 kyrs , corresponding to @xmath93kyrs .",
    "assuming the surface dipolar field decay is the only factor influencing magnetar braking indices , by combining the values of @xmath79 with eq.(11 ) , we plot the diagrams of @xmath0 versus @xmath94 for three magnetars , shown as in fig.3 .    in fig.3 , the solid - squares denote the values of @xmath0 obtained from eq.(10 ) , and the empty - squares denote the values of @xmath0 obtained from eq.(11 ) and the age - values presented in vigan et al .",
    "the detailed calculations and comparisons are as follows :    1 .   for 1e 1841 , when @xmath87kyrs , which is consistent with the snr age estimated by this work , its braking index @xmath95 , which is comparable to the measured value of @xmath969@xmath6517 ( see table 4 ) in the magnitude .",
    "2 .   for 1e 2259 , when @xmath93kyrs , which is also consistent with the snr age estimated by this work , its braking index @xmath0=20@xmath6540 , which approaches to the measured value of @xmath96 22@xmath6542 ( see table 4 ) in the magnitude .",
    "3 .   for sgr 0501 ,",
    "when @xmath91kyrs , its braking index @xmath973.8 , which is apparently smaller than the measured value of @xmath96 4.6@xmath658.0 ( see table 4 ) .",
    "this discrepancy may be caused by : 1 ) the in1tial dipolar magnetic field estimated is too low ; 2 ) the age estimate is too large ( compared with @xmath98kyrs in this work ) , and 3)the decay of the magnetospheric braking torque , e.g. , the surface dipolar field decay can not be the only factor influencing magnetar braking indices . here , we insert @xmath98kyrs into eq.(11 ) , then get @xmath964.1@xmath655.0 ( as denoted in the empty - circle in fig.3 ) , which is slightly larger than the value of @xmath973.8 by vigan et al.(2013 ) .",
    "although we have attributed the high - value braking indices of the three magnetars to the decay of the crustal surface magnetic field , there is the possibility of the decay of the magnetospheric braking torque , which can also result in the braking indices @xmath29 . below we will discuss the spin - down evolution for the three sources .",

    "if this decrease in @xmath100 is solely caused by the decay of @xmath78 , the mean surface dipolar field decaying - rate of @xmath79 is @xmath103gaussyr@xmath73 ( for a rotator in vacuum , @xmath104gauss ) , corresponding to the braking index @xmath105 obtained from eq.(11 ) .",
    "recently , dib & kaspi ( 2014 ) presented a summary of the long - term evolution of various properties of five axps including 1e 1841 and 1e 2259 , regularly monitored with _ rxte _ from 1996 to 2012 .",
    "influenced by frequent glitches and magnetar outbursts , 1e 1841 and 1e 2259 exhibited large fluctuations in their spin - down parameters @xmath17 and @xmath100 .",
    "however , both axps obviously exhibited net decrease in @xmath100 . for 1e 2259 , its @xmath100 decreased from @xmath106 to @xmath107hzs@xmath73 during an interval of mjd 50355@xmath6554852@xcite , which corresponds to @xmath108 according to eq.(11 ) . for 1e 1841 ,",

    "apart from 1e 1841 , the estimated values of @xmath0 from the surface dipolar magnetic field decay are far larger than the values of the measured mean braking indices for magnetars 1e 2259 and sgr 0501 .",
    "we suppose that these large and rapid decreases in @xmath100 were explained as the effects of timing - noise torque and outbursts @xcite , instead of as a secular dipole magnetic field decay .",
    "an actual decay of magnetospheric torque may explain the high braking index for a magnetar , but could result in an over - estimate of the surface dipolar field decay rate .",

    "( 14 ) , a decreasing magnetospheric current @xmath112 produces a decaying @xmath117 , which will cause a decrease in @xmath100 . for an net decay of toque due to the decrease in @xmath112 , the relative decrease in the spin - down rate",

    "note that , a precise calculation of @xmath6 ( or @xmath100 ) depends on solving the euler dynamics equations that are very complicate and uncertain ( beskin & nokhrina 2007 ) .",
    "it is also possible that a decrease in @xmath116 can cause a decrease in spin - down rate , as observed . during the long - term observations , these three magnetars with snrs experienced frequent outbursts and glitches .",
    "@xcite . during post - outburst or glitch recoveries ,",
    "the stellar platelets move towards the rotational axes .",
    "the magnetic field lines anchored to the crusts follow the motion , and the inclination angle @xmath116 decreases ( antonopoulou et al .",
    "a decrease in @xmath116 will result in a net decay of the magnetospheric braking toque .",
    "thus , the overall effect can be a decrease in @xmath100 .",
    "for a small decrease of @xmath116 , the relative decrease in @xmath100 is estimated as @xmath120 in mdr model , or as @xmath121 , here @xmath122 is the braking torque for the force - free magnetosphere ( spitkovsky 2006).](spitkovsky 2006 ; antonopoulou et al .",
    "if the external magnetospheric mechanisms ( whether due to the change in the current or due to the change in the inclination angle ) dominate the spin - down evolutions for three magnetars , the order of magnitude of the relative decreases in the braking torque is about latexmath:[$|\\delta t / t|\\approx    2259 , 1e 1841 and sgr 0501 .    in summary",
    ", we have quantitatively analyzed several physical processes ( the decay of surface dipolar field , the decline of the current , and the decrease in the inclination angle ) , possibly causing @xmath3 for magnetars .",
    "a common characteristic of these processes is that they can result in a decay of the braking torque on the star . here",
    "we ignore the effects of the stellar multipole magnetic moments on the magnetar braking indices , because the higher - order magnetic moments decay rapidly with the distance to stellar center .      in previous works , many authors proposed various models to explain why the observed braking indices of pulsars @xmath2 , e.g. , neutrino and photon radiation @xcite ; the combination of dipole radiation and the propeller torque applied by debris - disk @xcite ; frequent glitches , as well as magnetosphere currents ( beskin & nokhrina 2007 ) . in this work ,",
    "the lower braking indices of @xmath2 for five magnetars with snrs are attributed to the combination of mdr and wind - aided braking .",
    "recently , the extended emission observed from 1e 1547 and swift j1834 are proposed to be magnetism - powered pulsar - wind - nebulas ( pwns ) , which may accelerate plasma to very high energy and radiate high - energy photons ( see kargaltsev et al .",

    "the authors assumed that all the high luminosity magnetars with @xmath171 spin down via wind braking , and transient magnetars with @xmath172 spin down via magnetic dipole braking .",
    "based on a simple assumption of @xmath173 ( @xmath174 is the escaping particle luminosity ) .",
    "they concluded that , for typical axps and sgrs , the dipole magnetic field in the case of wind braking is about ten - times lower than that of magnetic- dipole braking , and a strong dipole magnetic field may be no longer necessary for some sources and so on .",
    "however , when estimating @xmath40 , one should be cautious taking into account effective braking indices .",
    "considering the possible snr associations and their ages and assuming a constant braking index over the magnetar s lives , we have estimated the average values of braking indices , for the eight magnetar , and discussed the possible origins of the braking indices .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .    1 .   based on possible timing solutions of magnetars and updated measurements of their associated snrs , we estimate the braking indices @xmath0 of eight magnetars , and find that they cluster in a range of @xmath175 .",
    "we attribute the higher braking indices , @xmath3 , of 1e 2259 , 1e 1841 and sgr 0501 to the surface dipolar field decay , or to the decay of the external magnetospheric braking torque . in the former case ,",
    "the estimated dipolar field decay rates , based on the updated magneto - thermal evolution models , are compatible with the measured values of @xmath0 for these three sources .",
    "we attribute the lower mean braking indices , @xmath28 , of other five magnetars ( sgr 0526 , sgr 1627 , psr j1622 , cxou j1714 and swift j1734 ) to a combination of mdr and wind - aided braking , and estimate their possible wind luminosities @xmath133 .    at last",
    ", we remind that , in order to derive an analytical expression for estimating the magnetar s true age , the braking index is assumed to be a constant . however , the inferred quantities ( e.g. , @xmath40 and @xmath30 ) of a magnetar strongly depend on the current values of @xmath176 and @xmath177 ( or of @xmath17 and @xmath100 ) that * can * vary with time",
    ". there always exist observational errors when estimating @xmath31 for magnetars .",
    "thus , for some sources , their constrained values of @xmath0 are subject to substantial uncertainties , and will be modified with future observations .",
    "we expect that more observations of magnetars and their snrs will help in further constraining the magnetar braking mechanisms .",
