    "we show in section [ sec : liegroup ] that in many cases , vector fields whose flows preserve such a foliation have a particularly simple structure , namely , they can be written as a sum of two vector fields , one tangent to the leaves of the foliation ( being the orbits of a group action ) , and one invariant under the group action .",

    "that is , @xmath252 , and the tangent and invariant vector fields do not span the foliate vector fields .",
    "the flow of a foliate vector field necessarily maps leaves to leaves diffeomorphically .",

    "@xmath40-equivariance means @xmath258 for all @xmath140 , so @xmath259 iff @xmath260 .",
    "then we have @xmath261 , as required .",
    "note that the result is not true for all @xmath40-foliate flows .",
    "in example [ ex : counter ] , the isotropy groups are @xmath262 , which are all invariant under conjugacy , because @xmath40 is abelian . therefore @xmath263 is not conjugate to @xmath264 for @xmath265 .",
    "the flow of the foliate vector field @xmath266 , @xmath267 therefore maps leaves to leaves of non - conjugate isotropy .",
    "given a lie group foliate vector field @xmath268 , this splitting into tangent and invariant pieces may not be unique , because it depends on the choice of @xmath40-invariant metric ( or splitting of @xmath168 ) .",
    "in fact we have the whole family of splittings @xmath269 for any @xmath40-invariant vector field @xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , once such a splitting has been found , it can be used to construct foliate integrators .",
    "first , one can integrate each piece separately and compose the results : @xmath270 by any integrator for vector fields on homogeneous spaces @xcite , and @xmath257 by any symmetry - preserving integrator , although these are easy to construct only when the action is linear .",
    "it is also possible to construct integrators in one piece .",

    "note that the first term on the right is tangent to the foliation .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath275 and @xmath276 so that the first term is @xmath270 and the second term is @xmath257 : @xmath277 here we are using that the range of @xmath278 is @xmath279 . if the action is not free then this map is not injective  many lie algebra elements generate the same tangent vector @xmath280and some choice of the inverse @xmath281 must be made to specify a vector field on @xmath40 .",
    "however , in the examples below a natural choice can be made .",
    "thus we have extended the vector field on @xmath1 to a vector field on @xmath282 with extra foliate structure of its own . integrating the reduced vector field @xmath283 by a symmetry - preserving method",
    "leaves a reconstruction problem on @xmath40 .",
    "however , the vector field on @xmath40 is now known only at the time steps of the solution of @xmath283 which could make it difficult to achieve high orders .",
    "it is better to integrate the full system together as follows .",
    "when @xmath284 and the group action is linear , the following algorithm provides a foliate integrator of order @xmath123 for @xmath268 .",

    ", @xmath257 has a linear symmetry and this is preserved by the runge - kutta method .",
    "that is , the integrator on @xmath10 is @xmath40-equivariant and hence preserves the foliation into @xmath40-orbits . applying rkmk to the differential equation on @xmath40 is equivalent to applying the same rkmk method to the full system on @xmath282 with respect to the group action of @xmath282 on itself given by @xmath289 and hence it has order @xmath123 . reconstructing",
    "the solution by acting on @xmath290 with @xmath255 only moves the point around on the new leaf , so the total integrator is foliate .",
    "the matrix differential equation @xmath291 $ ] motivated much of the work in lie group integrators @xcite .",
    "let @xmath292 be a matrix lie group , let @xmath293 , the lie algebra of @xmath40 , and let @xmath294 be a subgroup of @xmath40 which acts on @xmath1 by adjoint action , i.e. @xmath295 for @xmath296 , @xmath297 .",
    "recall that the `` isospectral manifolds '' of @xmath298 are the sets of matrices similar by an element of @xmath299 . in the present example , the leaves of the foliation are the sets of matrices in @xmath300 which are similar by an element of @xmath294 , and hence are submanifolds of the isospectral manifolds .",

    "it is not so easy to explicitly construct all invariant vector fields .",
    "the classical method requires determining a complete and independent set of differential invariants of the action .",
    "another approach which can work if the action is understood well enough is to choose a reference point on each orbit , choose an isotropy - invariant tangent vector at each reference point , and push them around the leaves using the group action .",
    "for example , consider the case @xmath306 .",
    "the orbits are the conjugacy classes of matrices so a reference point on each orbit is given by the jordan matrices . restricting for simplicity to the diagonalizable matrices , whose isotropy groups are the group of nonsingular diagonal matrices , we first choose @xmath307 diagonal ( so that it is isotropy invariant ) , and then define @xmath308 where @xmath309 is the diagonalization of @xmath52 .",
    "this constructs all invariant vector fields on the diagonalizable matrices .",
    "furthermore , this case provides a nice example of theorem 8 in a case in which the action is not proper .",
    "the set of diagonal matrices form a slice at any diagonal matrix , on which all isotropy subgroups are equal , so assumption ( ii ) of the theorem is automatically satisfied .",
    "the @xmath203-invariant splitting of @xmath118 ( assumption ( i ) ) is provided by splitting into diagonal and off - diagonal parts .",
    "hence from theorem 8 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) spans all foliate vector fields in this case .",
    "we can think of the foliate vector fields as those for which the evolution of the eigenvalues of @xmath52 depends only on those eigenvalues , and not on the individual entries of @xmath52 .",
    "more explicit examples of invariant vector fields are given by @xmath310 where @xmath123 is a real analytic function ( which , when extended to matrices , maps @xmath118 into @xmath118)and @xmath311 .",

    "( [ eq : representation ] ) we represent the solution as @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath314 , and work with the system on @xmath315 , @xmath316 since the symmetry of the second equation is linear , it is preserved by any linearly covariant method , such as runge - kutta .",

    "we plan to study such systems more in the future @xcite .",
    "second , a foliate system may have extra structure , corresponding to the different infinite dimensional lie subalgebras of the lie algebra of foliate vector fields .",
    "these so - called nonprimitive lie subalgebras have not been classified",
    ". however , many examples can be constructed by considering ( i ) the vector field to lie in some other lie algebra , as of hamiltonian or volume - preserving vector fields ; ( ii ) the reduced system on the space of leaves to lie in some other lie algebra ( in this case the foliated phase space has _ transverse _ structure ) ; and ( iii ) the reconstruction system , considered as a nonautonomous vector field on a leaf , to lie in some other lie algebra .",
    "( it is the relationships between the reduced and reconstruction systems which have not been classified . )",
    "cartan [ 5 ] provides an interesting list of all infinite - dimensional lie pseudogroups in two dimensions .",
    "for example , in the group @xmath350 the foliation @xmath351 const .",
    "is preserved , and the reconstruction dynamics lie in the fractional linear group .",
    "but in the group @xmath352 what structure is preserved ? in all of these cases",
