    "the well understood features in the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , such as acoustic peaks and the damping tail @xcite , allow a useful probe of the cosmology @xcite .",
    "the ability of cmb anisotropies to constrain most , or certain combinations of , parameters that define cold dark matter cosmological models with adiabatic initial conditions has driven a significant number of experiments from ground and space .",
    "these experiments include nasa s map mission and , in the long term , esa s planck surveyor . with the successful detection of the first two or three acoustic peaks at degree",
    "angular scales @xcite , the anisotropy experiments have started to focus on fluctuations on angular scales of arcminutes or less . at these angular scales , fluctuations",
    "are mostly dominated by secondary effects due to the local large scale structure ( lss ) between us and the last scattering surface @xcite .",
    "in addition to generating new anisotropies via scattering and gravitational infall , non - linear effects such as the weak gravitational lensing of the cmb @xcite leave important imprints that can in turn be used to probe cosmology or astrophysics related to the evolution and growth of structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the lensing effect on the cmb leads to modifications in the direction of photon propagation while leaving the surface brightness of the cmb unaffected , implying that its contributions are effectively at the second order level in temperature fluctuations .",
    "this second order contribution is probed by the three - point correlation function of the cmb @xcite . here , contributions arise mainly due to the fact that potentials that deflect cmb photons also correlate with other secondary effects from the foreground large scale structure , such as the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ; @xcite ) effect or the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ; @xcite ) effect . at the four - point level ,",
    "the weak lensing effect itself contributes to the correlation function due to its non - linear mode - coupling nature .",
    "the trispectrum , the four - point correlation function in fourier space , due to lensing was discussed in @xcite and the same trispectrum , under an all - sky formulation , is presented in @xcite . in @xcite , we presented the trispectrum due to lensing alone and the correlation between lensing and secondary effects and focused on the resulting non - gaussian covariance of the power spectrum measurements of the cmb temperature fluctuations .    here",
    ", we study an important application of the cmb trispectrum involving a model independent recovery of statistics related to the foreground angular deflections of cmb photons ( or alternatively the projected potentials that generate these deflections ) . in terms of the trispectrum formulated under a flat - sky approximation",
    ", we show explicitly how one can use a higher order statistic such as the power spectrum of squared temperatures to extract the lensing information . the approach described in the present paper",
    "was first introduced by ref . @xcite while other approaches were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite based on cmb temperature and polarization observations .",
    "we discuss the full trispectrum formed by the weak lensing effect on the cmb and extend previous work on this subject by calculating in detail the noise associated with lensing extraction .",
    "we also discuss noise contributions resulting from the cmb trispectrum formed via the correlation between lensing and secondary effects due to the large scale structure .",
    "since the lensing effect modifies the damping tail of cmb anisotropies and the information from the damping tail is used to reconstruct lensing statistics , we suggest that any secondary effect that dominates small angular scale fluctuations can have a significant impact on the lensing extraction .",
    "an important contribution at these scales is the sz effect ; fortunately this contribution can be removed from thermal cmb maps by noting its distinct spectral signature in observations involving many frequencies about the sz null at @xmath0 217 ghz @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the lensing extraction is essential for an important application utilizing cmb polarization observations .",
    "it is now well known that the curl ( or b - modes ) of the polarization allows a direct detection of the gravitational wave contribution @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the angular power spectrum of this polarization signal is proportional to the square of the energy scale of inflation , and thus any detection of the b - mode polarization allows a probe of the inflationary energy scale .",
    "there is one significant source of confusion , however , in the b - mode map which can potentially limit the detection of the gravitational wave signal . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the weak lensing effect on cmb polarization results in a fractional conversion of the dominant e - mode polarization due to density perturbations to the b - mode .",
    "the contribution from lensing to the b - mode map is such that its power spectrum is at the level of the polarization signal expected from gravitational waves if the energy scale of inflation is at scales of @xmath0 @xmath1 gev .",
    "since we do not know the energy scale of inflation a priori , if it is sufficiently small the lensing effect will easily dominate the contribution from primordial gravitational waves .    in order to identify the gravitational wave signature with no confusion",
    ", one must separate the contribution due to lensing reliably . as discussed in @xcite , observations of weak lensing in large scale structure via galaxy ellipticities",
    "do not allow a useful separation of the lensing contribution .",
    "a substantial contribution to the effect comes from potentials at redshift greater than 1 to 2 , the redshift range currently accessible with galaxy lensing surveys .",
    "even if we have a reliable lensing survey out to a redshift of 5 , we will only be able to reduce the lensing signal by a factor of @xmath0 4 , which is hardly of any use given the order of magnitude change in the gravitational wave contribution that is possible if the inflationary energy scale is much less than that related to grand unified theories @xcite .",
    "thus , a better approach is to use a source at the last scattering itself , ie .",
    "cmb anisotropies , to reconstruct the lensing potential .",
    "with such a reconstruction , one can clean the polarization maps and obtain unbiased and model independent estimates of the polarization signal at the last scattering surface . here , we discuss in detail the approach related to the cmb trispectrum and associated non - gaussian noises , ignored previously in lensing reconstruction @xcite and in the application of lensing reconstruction to separate the gravitational wave signature @xcite . under certain conditions ,",
    "we find that these additional noise contributions are an order of magnitude below the dominant gaussian noise contribution . if the noise - bias associated with the gaussian part of the temperature squared power spectrum is removed , then the limiting noise level for lensing extraction is determined by the non - gaussian contribution presented here .",
    "even if the noise - bias is not removed , we note that the proposed statistic allows a high signal - to - noise extraction of the lensing signal and a separation of the confusing lensed e - mode contribution in the b - mode map from those due to inflationary gravitational waves .",
    "in   [ sec : generallensing ] , we introduce the basic ingredients for the present calculation .",
    "the cmb anisotropy trispectra due to weak lensing and correlations between weak lensing and secondary effects are derived in ",
    "[ sec : lensing ] . in ",
    "[ sec : covariance ] , we introduce a statistic involving the power spectrum of squared temperatures , instead of the usual temperature itself , as a probe of the angular power spectrum of lensing deflections and extend the discussion to involve polarization in   [ sec : ebtri ] . in   [ sec : results ] , we discuss our results and conclude with a summary in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the appendix contains useful formulae related to additional estimators of lensing based on polarization and a combination of temperature and polarization .",
    "large - scale structure between us and the last scattering surface deflects cmb photons propagating towards us .",
    "since the lensing effect on cmb is essentially a redistribution of photons from large scales to small scales , the resulting effect appears only in the second order @xcite . in weak gravitational lensing , the deflection angle on the sky",
    "is given by the angular gradient of the lensing potential , @xmath2 , which itself is a projection of the gravitational potential , @xmath3 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath4    the quantities here are the conformal distance or lookback time , from the observer , given by @xmath5 and the analogous angular diameter distance @xmath6 with the expansion rate for adiabatic cdm cosmological models with a cosmological constant given by @xmath7\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath8 can be written as the inverse hubble distance today @xmath9mpc .",

    ", @xmath48 is the unlensed primary component of cmb , the contribution at the last scattering surface , and @xmath49 is the contribution affected by the gravitational lensing deflections during the transit .",
    "it should be understood that in the presence of low redshift contributions to cmb resulting through large scale structure , the temperature fluctuations also include a secondary contribution which we denote by @xmath50 and , in all cases , a noise component denoted by @xmath51 due to instrumental and detector limitations .",
    "we denote the total contribution involving these through @xmath52 , such that , @xmath53 . since weak lensing deflection angles also trace the large scale structure at low redshifts , secondary effects which are first order in density or potential fluctuations also correlate with the lensing deflection angle @xmath28 .",

    "this filter requires knowledge of the noise contributions to the map as well as the power spectra of prelensed primary anisotropies at the last scattering surface .",
    "though the filter can be easily applied to the fourier transform of the squared temperature map in the fourier space , a useful direct approach is presented in ref .",
    "this real space construction involves the divergence of the temperature - weighted temperature gradients , with each of these temperature estimators first filtered for the excess noise .",
    "we have extended the previous discussions of the extraction of lensing signal to include a discussion of the full trispectrum .",
    "the full trispectrum contains terms which were previously ignored and these terms contribute as additional sources of noise in the lensing reconstruction and can potentially interfere with the extraction of the lensing signal from cmb data .",

    "this conclusion is subject to several conditions . as summarized in figure  ( [ fig : sznoise ] ) , the extraction from temperature alone can be significantly impaired by the presence of foregrounds that correlate with the lensing deflection angle .",
    "for example , the sz contribution hinders the separation in two ways .",
    "the first is an enhancement of the gaussian noise signal by the addition of @xmath157 to @xmath129 as indicated by the difference between top dashed and the dot - dashed lines .",
    "the second is a noise contribution due to the non - gaussian trispectrum formed by the correlation of lensing potentials with the sz effect due to the large scale structure .",
    "we show this with the long - dashed line . in the presence of sz",
    ", it is now clear that the lensing extraction is strongly limited .",
    "the other source of correlation is the isw effect .",
    "its effects , through the contribution to gaussian noise , are already included in the @xmath158 defined earlier .",
    "the power spectra calculated using the publicly available cmbfast code @xcite contain the isw signal as well .",
    "the noise due to the correlation between isw and lensing is significantly smaller and is at a level below @xmath159 in figure  ( [ fig : sznoise ] ) .",
    "thus , one can easily ignore the additional noise contributions resulting from the isw effect .",
    "furthermore , the sz noise contributions can also be controlled .",
    "one can easily separate the sz contribution from thermal cmb fluctuations based on the frequency spectrum of the sz effect @xcite . in the upcoming planck mission ,",
    "sz separation based on multifrequency data will prevent this contribution from adding significant noise to cmb maps .",
    "we suggest that small angular scales experiments seeking to extract the lensing signal based on temperature anisotropies be designed to contain channels that are optimized for a separation of the sz signal from thermal cmb fluctuations .",
    "in addition to temperature , lensing also modifies polarization data .",
    "thus , one can employ estimators based on polarization , and combinations of polarization and temperature , to extract information related to lensing . in figure  ( [ fig : ebnoise ] ) , we illustrate the usefulness of polarization observations for a lensing separation .",
    "the dotted lines are the errors associated with the extraction based on the eb estimator .",
    "this estimator was suggested by @xcite as an estimator that probes the angular power spectrum of lensing on scales smaller than that probed by temperature or other combinations of temperature and polarization .",
    "ee and @xmath160e estimators also probe the lensing deflection power spectrum , and have gaussian and non - gaussian noise contribution in between those of the @xmath161 and eb estimators . while we presented a detailed derivation of the eb estimator",
    ", we write down the trispectrum and related filters for other estimators associated with polarization and combinations of polarization and temperature in the appendix . as shown in figure  ( [ fig : ebnoise ] ) , we again find the non - gaussian noise contributions due to additional noise terms in various trispectra due to lensing alone to be roughly an order of magnitude below the dominant gaussian noise contribution .",
    "similar to the @xmath161 estimator , the @xmath160e estimator contains an additional noise term due to the correlation between weak lensing and secondary anisotropies such as the sz effect .",
    "we have presented a derivation of this contribution in the appendix . in both these cases , note that we have only considered the secondary contributions to the temperature .",
    "unlike contributions to the temperature , secondary contributions to the polarization are significantly smaller and are higher order in density fluctuations ; for example , in addition to the density field , these secondary effects also depend on the velocity field @xcite .",
    "this makes the secondary polarization - lensing correlations less significant , similar to the correlation between lensing potentials and the moving baryons responsible for the ostriker - vishniac / kinetic sz effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , we ignore noise contributions from secondary effects associated with lensing extraction based on polarization estimators alone .    in general , the cmb data allow high signal - to - noise ratio reconstruction of the lensing effect .",
    "we illustrate the extent to which planck s frequency cleaned temperature maps can be used as a lensing experiment in figure  ( [ fig : convergence ] ) . here",

    ", we show the cumulative signal - to - noise ratio for planck based on the quadratic statistic discussed here and the gradient - based statistic of @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction based on the squared power spectrum has factor of @xmath0 3 higher cumulative signal - to - noise than the one based on gradients in the temperature map .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the latter method only extracts lensing from the first order expansion of the temperature in terms of the deflection angle , while significant contributions also come from the second order term that is also probed by the proposed estimators .    as shown in figure  ( [ fig : convergence ] ) , due to planck s beam of @xmath0 5 to 10 arcmin the reconstruction of convergence becomes noise dominated at multipoles of @xmath0 1000 , while one can probe lensing to much smaller angular scales with galaxy information .",
    "the difference between the two curves illustrate the importance of lensing reconstruction for the polarization studies related to gravitational waves .",
    "since cmb photons are affected by potentials out to the last scattering surface , the resulting lensing effect is at least an order of magnitude higher than the lensing effect on sources that are visible from the large scale structure out to a redshift of a few .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that observations of the large scale structure lensing can be used to subtract the lensing contribution to the b - mode polarization sufficiently to permit a confusion free detection of the polarization signal due to gravitational waves .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a further discussion on this application .",
    "we can extend the discussion in @xcite to consider one interesting possibility . as discussed earlier",
    ", one can make a significant improvement in the lensing reconstruction when the gaussian noise bias associated with the temperature squared power spectrum is removed .",
    "in such a scenario , the noise contribution associated with the lensing extraction is determined by the non - gaussianities which are usually an order of magnitude below the dominant gaussian noise contribution .",
    "such a gaussian noise bias removal allows an extremely high signal - to - noise extraction of the lensing signal even for experiments with poor sensitivities that are not optimized for the lensing reconstruction . as shown in figure",
    "( [ fig : convergence ] ) , for planck , the removal of the dominant gaussian noise leads to detection of the lensing angular power spectrum with a cumulative signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath0 700 , which is roughly a factor of 20 above the level expected when the dominant gaussian noise contribution is not removed .",
    "such an extraction not only improves the effectiveness of cosmological studies involving lensing of the cmb @xcite , but also allows a high signal - to - noise separation of the lensed e - mode contribution to the b - mode polarization map of the cmb .",
    "this improves the confusion - free limit on the inflationary energy scale attainable with cmb polarization experiments by another order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we illustrate the importance of noise - bias removal in figure  ( [ fig : inflation ] ) . here , we compare various contributions to the power spectra of cmb polarization , including the lensed e - mode contribution to the b - mode polarization map .",
    "we also show the residual lensing contribution to the b - mode map after the lensing effect has been largely removed using an estimator for lensing deflections .",
    "the estimator employs a cmb temperature map with a resolution of 1 arcmin and a sensitivity of 1 @xmath155k @xmath156 .",
    "the curve labeled @xmath162 is the residual contribution when the lensing extraction is carried out to the noise level determined by the non - gaussian noise contribution , assuming that the dominant gaussian noise contribution can be removed during the lensing extraction .",
    "as shown , such a removal provides an order of magnitude improvement over the residual from the dominant gaussian contribution .    in the right panel of figure  ( [ fig : inflation ] ) , we show limits on the inflationary energy scale based on lensing extraction with the remaining residuals depicted in the left panel of the same figure .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details related to this calculation . for comparison",
    ", we also show the inflationary energy scale limit when the lensing contribution is ignored ( only instrumental noise ) and the limit when the lensing contribution is treated as an additional contribution to the noise associated with the b - mode map .",
    "as illustrated in these figures , the potential removal of the gaussian noise associated with the lensing reconstruction reduces by an order of magnitude the confusion - free upper bound on the gravitational wave signal in the b - mode polarization .",
    "such an improvement motivates the development of practical schemes to remove the noise - bias associated with the dominant gaussian part of the temperature squared power spectrum . in future work , we will return to this issue and will investigate ways to achieve the required level of noise removal .",
    "we have discussed the four - point correlation function , or the trispectrum in fourier space , of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies due to the weak gravitational lensing effect by intervening large scale structure .",
    "the trispectrum contains information related to the lensing deflection angle , which for a given configuration of the trispectrum is captured primarily by the diagonal of the quadrilateral that defines the trispectrum in fourier space .",
    "we have devised a statistic involving the power spectrum of squared temperatures that captures this information from the diagonal .",
    "this provides an observational approach to extracting the power spectrum of deflection angles induced by the weak gravitational lensing effect on the cmb .",
    "the method extends previous suggestions on the use of the squared temperature power spectrum to extract the lensing - secondary correlation power spectrum by probing the bispectrum formed by the lensing effect .",
    "the technique presented here is not new and has been discussed previously in the literature by @xcite .",
    "we extend this work by providing a full derivation of the trispectrum terms both due to lensing and lensing - secondary correlations , and by providing a detailed discussion of the filtering required to minimize the dominant noise component due to gaussian temperature fluctuations that impairs the extraction of lensing information .",
    "we also extend previous discussions on the trispectrum and associated weak lensing reconstruction from cmb data by calculating in detail contributions to the noise in the reconstruction .",
    "previous work discussed the dominant gaussian noise , but we include in addition terms associated with non - gaussian contributions due to lensing alone and the correlation of the lensing effect with other foreground secondary anisotropies in the cmb such as the isw effect and the sz effect .",
    "when the sz effect is removed from the temperature maps using its spectral dependence , we find these additional non - gaussian noise contributions to be an order of magnitude lower than the dominant gaussian noise .",
    "when sz is not removed , the extraction of lensing information is significantly suppressed ; we strongly advise the use of multiple frequencies in upcoming small angular scale cmb experiments , if there is an interest in using data from such experiments to conduct a weak lensing study .",
    "the lensing extraction provides a high signal - to - noise ratio detection of the lensing deflection power spectrum . for the planck surveyor , with frequency - cleaned temperature maps",
    ", detection will have a cumulative signal - to - noise of @xmath0 35 , while certain techniques in the literature @xcite , involving the gradients of the temperature map , only give a cumulative signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath0 10 .",
    "since the extraction with planck is severely limited by its beam of 5 to 10 arcmin , we strongly recommend higher resolution observations at the arcminute scale .",
    "if the noise - bias associated with the dominant gaussian part of the temperature squared power spectrum is removed , planck can extract the lensing power spectrum with temperature data alone with a cumulative signal - to - noise ratio around @xmath0 700 .",
    "with information from polarization , the signal - to - noise ratio associated with lensing can be further increased by another factor of a few .",
    "the order of magnitude improvement in the lensing separation motivates the development of practical methods that can remove the dominant gaussian noise contribution to the squared temperature power spectrum .",
    "in general , our study suggests that future cmb observations can be used as a weak lensing experiment akin to current attempts involving lensing reconstruction from galaxy ellipticity data .",

    "<S> we discuss the four - point correlation function , or the trispectrum in fourier space , of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies due to the weak gravitational lensing effect by intervening large scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the squared temperature power spectrum as a probe of this trispectrum and , more importantly , as an observational approach to extracting the power spectrum of the deflection angle associated with the weak gravitational lensing effect on the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> we extend previous discussions on the trispectrum and associated weak lensing reconstruction from cmb data by calculating non - gaussian noise contributions , beyond the previously discussed dominant gaussian noise . </S>",
    "<S> non - gaussian noise contributions are generated by lensing itself and by the correlation between the lensing effect and other foreground secondary anisotropies in the cmb such as the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect . </S>",
    "<S> when the sz effect is removed from temperature maps using its spectral dependence , we find these additional non - gaussian noise contributions to be an order of magnitude lower than the dominant gaussian noise . if the noise - bias due to the dominant gaussian part of the temperature squared power spectrum is removed , then these additional non - gaussian contributions provide the limiting noise level for the lensing reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature squared power spectrum allows a high signal - to - noise extraction of the lensing deflections and a confusion - free separation of the curl ( or b - mode ) polarization due to inflationary gravitational waves from that due to lensed gradient ( or e - mode ) polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the small angular scale temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements provide a novel approach to weak lensing studies , complementing the approach based on galaxy ellipticities . </S>"
