    "ever since its discovery by @xcite , palomar 1 ( pal 1 ) has been tentatively classified as a globular cluster ( gc ) , primarily because of its location high above the galactic plane ( @xmath1 kpc ; @xcite , 2010 edition ) .",
    "however , pal 1 has several anomalous characteristics that have cast doubt upon this classification .",
    "for example , pal 1 appears to be unusually young for an outer halo gc .",
    "using standard isochrone fits to pal 1 s ground - based color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , @xcite estimated an age between @xmath7 and @xmath8 gyr , while @xcite found an age between 4 and 6 gyr with hst photometry .",
    "this f606w ( @xmath9v ) , f814w ( @xmath9i ) hst cmd of the central field of pal 1 from @xcite ( see figure [ fig : cmd ] ) shows the main sequence turn - off around f606w @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and a possible detection of a red horizontal branch near f606w @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath14 , making the cluster younger than about 7 gyr ( with the method of @xcite ) .",
    "these estimates make pal 1 one of the youngest gcs , along with ter 7 , pal 12 , and whiting 1 , whose ages range from @xmath15 gyr ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "pal 1 also lacks luminous , evolved stars .",
    "the cmd in figure [ fig : cmd ] shows a sparsely populated red giant branch and a barely detectable horizontal branch .",
    "furthermore , near - infrared medium - resolution spectroscopy of the triplet ( cat ) lines in four of these red giants has shown that pal 1 is fairly metal - rich for an outer halo gc , with an average @xmath3 = -0.6 $ ] ( on the zinn - west scale , using the standard galactic cat line strength to metallicity conversion ; @xcite ) . the main sequence is also poorly populated , and therefore the entire cluster has an extremely low total luminosity for a gc ( @xmath16 ; @xcite , 2010 edition ) .    clearly pal 1 does not conform to the characteristics of traditional galactic gcs , suggesting either that pal 1 is not a gc or that it is not galactic .",
    "if pal 1 has been misclassified as a gc , another possibility is that it could be an open cluster ( oc)this option seems unlikely due to the combination of its position above the galactic plane , its high concentration parameter ( @xmath17 ; @xcite , 2010 edition ) , and its age ( although pal 1 s age _ is _ comparable to that of the oldest known ocs , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , pal 1 s brightness and age place it in greater agreement with the ocs than with the gcs ( see figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the ambiguity surrounding the oc vs. gc classification leads to a need for a more rigorous distinction between the two . from observations of many galactic gcs",
    ", @xcite defined a gc as a cluster that shows signs of a second generation of stars through a na / o anticorrelation . under this definition , if pal 1 does _ not _ show signs of a na / o anticorrelation , then it can not be considered a classical gc .",
    "alternatively , pal 1 could have originated in a dwarf galaxy and been accreted by the milky way during a merger .",
    "the latter situation is plausible , as several other galactic gcs , notably the young clusters listed above , have been linked to dwarf galaxies .",
    "m54 , arp 2 , ter 7 , and ter 8 lie on a stream associated with the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal ( sgr dsph ) galaxy @xcite ; pal 12 has been kinematically linked to the sgr dsph through proper motion studies @xcite ; whiting 1 is undergoing tidal stripping and appears to lie in a stream of m giants from the sgr dsph @xcite ; and rup 106 has been tentatively associated with the magellanic clouds because of its location along the magellanic stream @xcite .",
    "pal 1 does appear to lie along several stellar streams that may be extragalactic but have not yet been associated with any galaxies .",
    "one such stream , known both as the monoceros stream and as the galactic anticenter stellar stream ( gass ) , appears to be from a disrupted dwarf satellite ( e.g. @xcite ) ; pal 1 s position , velocity , and metallicity make it a possible member of this stream @xcite .",
    "the canis major overdensity , which seems to be distinct from the gass @xcite , has also been associated with pal 1 , again because of the cluster s coincidental location @xcite .",
    "finally , pal 1 has also been tentatively linked to the `` orphan stream '' @xcite , though its radial velocity and metallicity make it an unlikely member @xcite . though no obvious association with a particular stream has been confirmed , tidal tails around pal 1 have recently been discovered , suggesting that the cluster itself is being dissipated in the tidal field of the galaxy @xcite .    in the absence of an obvious host galaxy",
    ", detailed chemical abundances can be used to examine if pal 1 has an extragalactic origin .",
    "it has been well established ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) that metal - rich stars in local group dwarf galaxies have distinctly different chemical abundances from stars in the milky way , at a given metallicity ( the differences are not so obvious by @xmath3 \\sim -2 $ ] ) .",
    "these chemical variations between the environments are due to different star formation histories and efficiencies , which are linked to the mass of the galaxy and the properties of its environment .",
    "therefore , the differences are not just between dwarf galaxies and normal galaxies  in fact , dwarf galaxies have unique chemical evolutions , meaning that it is possible to chemically link a star to its host galaxy ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these chemical differences are not just seen in field stars , they are also seen in gcs ; for example , @xcite showed that most galactic gcs have similar chemical abundances to galactic field stars at the same metallicity , with pal 12 , ter 7 , and rup 106 as notable exceptions .",
    "detailed , high - resolution chemical abundances have been used to trace the origin of several globular clusters . in particular pal 12 @xcite and ter 7 ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    "have [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios that follow the sgr dsph field star abundance trends and are clearly separated from galactic field stars , supporting the hypothesis that they were captured from the sgr dsph .",
    "the more metal - poor sgr clusters arp 2 and ter 8 , however , are not chemically distinct from the galaxy @xcite , which shows that the [ @xmath4/fe ] deviation can be metallicity- ( and presumably age- ) dependent . if pal 1 has an extragalactic origin , then its metallicity of @xmath3\\approx -0.6 $ ] puts it in a regime where [ @xmath4/fe ] and other chemical abundance ratios should be useful in determining its origin .    here",
    "we present a detailed analysis of high - resolution spectra for four red giant stars in pal 1 , taken with the subaru telescope . @xcite",
    "have completed a chemical analysis of one star in pal 1 ( pal 1-i ) , also with spectra taken at subaru , but with independent observations ; they find that their single star shows similar abundance patterns to galactic open clusters .",
    "@xcite further show that its chemistry implies that pal 1 could be associated with the canis major overdensity . with four stars ,",
    "our analysis allows us to determine the chemical abundance ratios with higher precision , and investigate any star - to - star variations in the abundances that could be linked with chemical or cluster evolution effects .",
    "section [ sec : observations ] outlines the observations and the data reduction , while section [ sec : ews ] examines our method for measuring equivalent widths . in section [ sec : modelatms ] we discuss the model atmospheres , particularly how the atmospheric parameters are derived . section [ sec : abundances ] presents the methods for element abundance determinations , while section [ sec : results ] examines the significance of these results with respect to galactic stars and clusters .",
    "finally , section [ sec : discussion ] examines the origins of pal 1 .",
    "four of our target stars are the same stars observed by @xcite : bright , red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , with radial velocities that make them likely cluster members .",
    "we refer to these stars as pal 1-i , -ii , -iii , and -iv , following the naming convention of rosenberg et al .",
    "the bright object located at the center of the cluster , pal 1-c , was also included as a target , although the membership of this object is not as certain as the others .",
    "the locations of these stars on a cmd and in an image of the cluster ( from @xcite ) are shown in figures [ fig : cmd ] and [ fig : targets ] .",
    "in addition to the pal 1 stars we include an analysis of a `` standard '' star , m67 - 141 ( as identified by @xcite ) .",
    "this star resides in the metal - rich open cluster m67 , and has previous detailed , high resolution chemical abundances from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table [ table : targets ] shows the positions and magnitudes of the target stars .",
    "the pal 1 positions and v and i magnitudes ( in the johnson system ) are from @xcite , while m67 - 141 s position and v and i magnitudes ( in the kron - cousins system ) are from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",

    "the default grating was centered at 5500  with a slit length of 5.6 arcsec for all stars and a slit width of 1 arcsec for the pal 1 stars and 0.6 arcsec for m67 - 141 , leading to spectral resolutions of @xmath2 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "table [ table : observations ] shows a list of the dates , total exposure times , and signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) for these observations .",
    "we note that the position of the moon was not preferable for observations of the pal 1 stars , as the primary target of this observing run was the sextans dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced using the basic subaru hds pipeline , with standard iraf routines to remove the bias and flat field , and with additional cosmic ray removal .",
    "the stars were fairly low in the sky during the observations and the seeing conditions were poor , meaning the stars observed in 2006 nearly filled the slit ; as a result the sky subtractions proved to be extremely difficult .",
    "ultimately some of the star signals were removed along with the sky even when using the outermost 3-pixels on either side of the projected slit spectrum ; thus , the final , co - added stellar spectra from 2006 ( stars pal 1-i and -ii ) have lower snr than expected .",
    "the sky subtraction for one of the 2007 stars , pal 1-iv , proved impossible , and that star has therefore been dropped from further abundance analyses .",
    "the other two stars , pal 1-iii and -c , have good sky subtraction and therefore higher snr .",
    "the radial velocities were determined by locating several strong , easily - identified spectral lines and calculating the shift in wavelength using gaussian fits to the lines .",
    "these radial velocities were then shifted to heliocentric velocities using the iraf task _ rvcorrect _ ; the final heliocentric velocities are listed in table [ table : observations ] .",
    "though a sky subtraction could not be performed on pal 1-iv , a radial velocity could still be obtained ; this radial velocity is quite different from the other stars , as will be discussed in section [ subsubsec : ufd ] .",

    "the continuum was estimated using an iterative , non - parametric filter ( e.g. @xcite ) designed to split the spectrum into continuum and line components based on a user - defined scale length for allowed continuum variations .",
    "this was set at 10  so that the strongest spectral absorption lines were not affected .",

    "in addition , different atomic data for mg , al , and ti causes additional discrepancies .",
    "the abundance seems to differ due to the solar sc abundances ; the measured solar ews in @xcite are considerably higher than ours , leading to a higher solar sc abundance and therefore a lower [ sc / fe ] for pal 1-i .",
    "the differences in atomic data are rather discouraging ; however , we note that while the choices of lines are broad , much of our atomic data overlaps with that of @xcite and @xcite , who provide the majority of the metal - rich galactic stars for the comparisons in our analysis .",

    "the answers to these questions may have implications for galaxy and cluster formation .      as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , pal 1 has traditionally been classified as a gc , primarily because of its location above the galactic plane and its high concentration parameter .",
    "however , pal 1 s high [ fe / h ] and red horizontal branch make it similar to the bulge / disk gcs @xcite , while its age sets it apart from all gcs .",

    "these unusual characteristics have caused pal 1 to be labeled as a `` transitional cluster '' @xcite .",
    "in addition , pal 1 s brightness and size make it an ultra faint cluster .",
    "a graph of absolute magnitude versus half - light radius ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) shows that pal 1 is fainter than typical globular clusters and occupies a position that could be an extrapolation of the dwarf galaxy and ultra faint dwarf galaxy trend .",
    "it is therefore worth investigating pal 1 s similarities to these different types of objects .",

    "fits of the @xcite isochrones are shown in figure [ fig : cmd ] , for ages of 4 , 5 , and 6 gyr ; the best age remains at @xmath62 gyr .",
    "the differences between these fits and those of @xcite are very slight , as expected since the adopted [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath4/fe ] combinations correspond to roughly the same [ m / h ] .",

    "the spread ratio is then a comparison of the width of the mean distribution to the width of a single star s error estimate : large values of the spread ratio imply that the star - to - star variations are larger than the average uncertainty for an individual star , suggesting that the cluster has a genuine abundance spread .",

    "as discussed in section [ subsec : naal ] , while na is slightly high and o is slightly low in pal 1-c , there is no significant range in the na abundances , and the four stars do not show evidence for an anticorrelation . certain models ( e.g. @xcite ) suggest that the formation of a second population in a gc depends on the cluster mass , since more massive clusters can retain more gas to form a second population ",
    "pal 1 s current mass , @xmath131 @xcite , is below the critical mass for retaining the gas to form a second population .",
    "it has been known for some time that pal 1 is in the process of evaporating @xcite ; @xcite further show that the mass in pal 1 s tidal tails is roughly equal to its current mass , suggesting that the cluster might have been at least twice as massive in the past . in the @xcite context",
    ", however , pal 1 s lack of a second generation implies that it was _ never _ more massive than @xmath132 , regardless of its current size .",
    "this restriction is not necessarily unusual for a gc : the gc pal 12 does not show signs of abundance spreads @xcite and five intermediate age ( @xmath133 gyr ) lmc gcs show no evidence for multiple populations in their cmds .",
    "pal 1 s detailed abundances can also be compared to the well - established gcs in the galaxy .",
    "its metallicity alone puts it in an unusual regime : while there are many metal - rich gcs , those are usually centrally concentrated in the bulge or disk , while pal 1 is located much further from the center and far above the disk ( @xmath0 kpc and @xmath1 kpc ; @xcite , 2010 edition ) . and hb morphology rather than its location , but its unusual location does distinguish it from the bulge / disk gcs . ]",
    "most of the iron - group ( figures [ fig : scvmnfe ] and [ fig : cocrnife ] ) , @xmath4- ( figures [ fig : alphafe1 ] and [ fig : alphafe2 ] ) , and neutron capture elements ( figures [ fig : ybalafe ] , [ fig : ndeufe ] , and [ fig : baybaeueualphafe ] ) are in good agreement between pal  1 and the sgr clusters ; however , the na , al , cu , and zn abundances ( figures [ fig : naalfe ] and [ fig : cuznfe ] ) are distinctly different .",

    "several of these clusters are located in the outer disk , and may have been accreted from a dwarf galaxy or formed during a major merging event @xcite . be 20 and 29 , the two clusters in our sample that lie closest to pal 1 s metallicity , have similar abundance ratios as the galactic stars , with the exceptions of the s - process neutron capture elements . thus , the only elements that are clearly discrepant between be 20/29 and pal 1 are the @xmath4-elements ( figures [ fig : alphafe1 ] and [ fig : alphafe2 ] ) and eu ( and by extension [ eu/@xmath4 ] and [ ba / eu ] ; figures [ fig : ndeufe ] and [ fig : baybaeueualphafe ] ) .",
    "cu , zn , and y abundances are not available for be 20 and 29 ; however , pal 1 s na and al abundances ( figure [ fig : naalfe ] ) agree better with be 20 and 29 than with the sgr clusters .",
    "it is then natural to ask if pal 1 looks more like the gcs pal 12 and ter 7 or the ocs be 20 and 29 . in terms of the @xmath4-elements and neutron capture elements pal 1 looks more like the gcs , while na and al agree more with the ocs .",

    "furthermore , the chemical abundances of stars depend on their host galaxies star formation histories , etc . , and these quantities are unique to individual galaxies . thus , unless all of the clusters originated in the sgr dsph , this comparison is not straightforward .",
    "we leave the question of pal 1 s origin to section [ subsec : extragalactic ] and we therefore focus on other parameters that may distinguish gcs from ocs .",
    "table [ table : other ] shows various quantities that can be compared between the clusters : the galactocentric radius , @xmath134 ( in kpc ) ; the distance above the galactic plane , @xmath135 ( in kpc ) ; distance from the sun , @xmath136 ( in kpc ) ; the age ( in gyr ; though note that these ages are assembled from different sources , and may not be valid for comparisons ) ; metallicity , [ fe / h ] ; absolute visual magnitude , @xmath137 ; half - light radii , @xmath138 ( in pc ; note that the distance was used to convert the half - light radius from arcminutes to pc ) ; and concentration parameter , @xmath139 .",

    "consequently , the distance above the sgr plane , @xmath140 , is also plotted for clusters that are ( or might be ) associated with the sgr dsph ( from @xcite ; note that pal 1 s @xmath140 is also included , although it is most likely _ not _ associated with sgr ) .",
    "examined this way , the clusters look very similar , i.e. _ the young , metal - rich gcs that are close to the sgr plane are similar to the old , metal - poor ocs that are close to the galactic plane , suggesting that these clusters may be classified as open ( or intermediate - aged ) clusters in the sgr frame of reference .",
    "_ @xcite also cast doubt upon the gc classification for pal 12 and ter 7 , given the lack of a definite na / o anticorrelation . under the carretta et al .",

    "the ufds are distinguished by their larger - than - expected velocity dispersions , which imply high mass / light ratios and large amounts of dark matter .",
    "the velocities for the five pal 1 stars ( including pal 1-iv ) listed in table [ table : observations ] imply a velocity dispersion of @xmath141 km s@xmath46 ( using the formula from @xcite ) , _ assuming that all five velocities are orbital velocities of cluster members .",
    "_ under this assumption , pal 1 s velocity dispersion is in agreement with the velocity dispersions of several ufds , including segue ii , leo v , leo iv , and hercules ( see the summary of ufd properties by @xcite ) .    as tempting as this comparison may be",
    ", it is not altogether appropriate .",
    "firstly , we now know that pal 1 has tidal tails and is therefore not in dynamical equilibrium @xcite . secondly , only one star ( pal 1-iv ) has a discrepant velocity , and this difference is easily explained if pal 1-iv is a binary ; @xcite showed that the presence of binaries can significantly boost the velocity dispersion of a low - mass system .",
    "alternatively , pal 1-iv could be a nonmember  its location in the cmd ( figure [ fig : cmd ] ) is separate from the other stars  however its consistent chemistry and very close radial velocity make this seem unlikely .",
    "therefore , pal 1 remains an ultra faint cluster , and though it would be interesting if it were an extrapolation of the ufds , its current velocity dispersion is best explained by its tidal disruption or by the presence of a binary .",
    "pal 1 has been tentatively associated with both the galactic anticenter stellar stream ( gass ) @xcite and the canis major ( cma ) overdensity ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , two streams of stars that could be from disrupted dwarf galaxies .",
    "if it is associated with either of these systems , then pal 1 should have similar chemical abundances to their associated field stars and clusters and to the stars in other low mass systems .",
    "figures [ fig : alphafe1dg ] through [ fig : baybaeueualphafedg ] compare the pal 1 abundances to those of stars in the nearby dwarf galaxies . note that only the average pal 1 abundance ( red star symbol ) is plotted , with the mean abundance error for [ x / fe ] ( e.g. @xmath41(obs ) in table [ table : spreads ] ) .",
    "the galactic field stars are shown in grey .",
    "dwarf galaxies are also included , with their field stars as small symbols and their gcs as larger open symbols .",
    "again , abundances have been averaged over an entire cluster .",

    "while other dwarf galaxy data are available in this metallicity range , plotting all of it makes these plots nearly illegible , and we have therefore included only the most relevant dwarf data ( i.e. galaxies with many stars and many elemental abundances in the same metallicity range as pal 1 ) for this discussion .      in terms of the @xmath4-elements ( figures [ fig : alphafe1dg ] and [ fig : alphafe2dg ] ) , pal 1 s slightly low [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios",
    "place it with the dwarf galaxies ( with the possible exception of ca ) .",
    "this suggests that type ia supernovae began to contribute to pal 1 s host environment at a lower [ fe / h ] than for stars in the galaxy .",

    "1 s [ sc / fe ] remains clearly distinct from the dwarf galaxy stars .",
    "pal 1 s [ v / fe ] ratio is in good agreement with the dwarfs , with the exception of the cma stars , which may be due to hfs corrections .",
    "overall the pal 1 fe - peak elements show the best agreement with the galactic stars rather than the dwarf galaxy stars .",
    "variations in [ fe - peak / fe ] with metallicity have been suggested to be due to metallicity - dependent supernovae yields , e.g. metal - poor type ia supernovae will produce less mn than metal - rich ones @xcite , as seen in the sgr field stars . however , pal 1 s agreement with the galactic and dwarf galaxy stars at a similar metallicity suggests no significant dispersion in the type ia contributions .",
    "the more peculiar elements , cu and zn ( figure [ fig : cuznfedg ] ) , are in better agreement with the galactic stars and possibly cma , and are clearly distinct from the sgr and lmc stars .",
    "finally , pal 1 s neutron capture elements ( figures [ fig : ybalafedg ] , [ fig : ndeufedg ] , and [ fig : baybaeueualphafedg ] ) agree better with the dwarf galaxies than with the galactic stars . pal 1 s low [ y / fe ] and high [ ba / fe ] , [ la / fe ] , and",
    "[ ba / y ] ratios suggest that like the sgr dsph , pal 1 was enriched by metal - poor agb stars .",
    "( this effect is also seen in the [ la / y ] ratios of the sgr stars ; @xcite ) . with an excess of neutrons per fe atom in metal - poor agb stars , more",
    "heavy second - peak s - process elements such as ba and la can be created , leaving a deficit of first - peak elements like y @xcite .",
    "this further suggests that pal 1 has not been enriched by its own metal - rich agb stars , which is perhaps not surprising given its lack of evolved stars ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the gass field stars do not have high [ la / fe ] like pal 1 , suggesting that it does not have an excess of second - peak to first - peak s - process elements .",
    "the cma stars do seem to have high [ ba / fe ] and [ la / fe ] , and arguably have low [ y / fe ] , in agreement with pal 1 .",
    "pal 1 also has slightly higher [ eu / fe ] , [ nd / fe ] , and [ eu/@xmath4 ] ratios than galactic stars , in agreement with the lmc , sgr , and fornax .",
    "while the cma stars do show an excess of nd , they do not appear to have an excess of eu , and cma therefore has a normal value for [ eu/@xmath4 ] .",
    "this suggests that dwarf galaxies have an additional source of r - process elements compared to the galaxy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is further supported by pal 1 and the dwarf galaxies high [ eu/@xmath4 ] ratio ; the standard model suggests that massive type ii supernovae are responsible for dispersing the @xmath4-elements , while lower mass ( 8 - 10 m@xmath61 ) type ii supernovae are the sole site of r - process elements like eu . if the dwarf galaxies had similar conditions to the galaxy , then the [ eu/@xmath4 ] ratio should remain flat .    despite its high values for [ ba / fe ] and [ eu / fe ] , the [ ba / eu ] ratio in pal 1 agrees better with the galactic stars than with the dwarf galaxies , though the fornax dispersion and pal 12 do extend down to pal 1 s value . again",
    "cma s [ ba / eu ] values are in fair agreement with pal 1 .",
    "as discussed earlier , at solar metallicity ba is primarily an s - process element , while eu is primarily an r - process element @xcite .",
    "the ratio [ ba / eu ] should therefore provide an indication of the relative contributions of the s - process to the r - process . before the s - process begins to contribute ba",
    "is initially produced solely through the r - process ; as time goes on the s - process creates more ba but little eu , and [ ba / eu ] increases .",
    "the theoretical r - process  only lower limit for [ ba / eu ] is shown in figure [ fig : baybaeueualphafedg ] .",
    "pal 1 s slightly high ba and eu abundances lead to a [ ba / eu ] value that agrees with the classical prediction for a system that has had little contribution from the s - process",
    ". clearly this can not be the case : pal 1 s [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios show that type ia supernovae have contributed to the system , and therefore agb stars must have also contributed since the timescale for evolution of type ia supernovae and agb stars is thought to be similar in chemical evolution models ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the [ ba / y ] ratio further implies that metal - poor agb stars must have contributed to the system .",
    "thus , the high [ eu / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] together with the high [ eu/@xmath4 ] suggest that there is an extra source of r - process elements in the pal 1 system , beyond what is present for typical galactic stars .",
    "it is unclear where the additional r - process abundances come from ; some possibilities include shot noise ( i.e. simple inhomogeneous mixing of a nearby supernova with a progenitor in the 8 - 10 m@xmath61 range ) , an unusual star formation history that may have included an effectively truncated imf ( missing the most massive stars that contribute significantly to the @xmath4 elements ) , or even variable nucleosynthetic yields .",
    "however , each of these possibilities has other consequences for the chemical abundance ratios that are not clearly indicated in pal 1 .",
    "whatever the case , pal 1 has clearly not followed the `` classical '' chemical evolution models .    based on these chemical comparisons ,",
    "we conclude that pal 1 likely originated in a dwarf satellite that was later accreted by the milky way ( about 500 myr ago ; @xcite ) . though the light elements ( @xmath142 ) are arguably in agreement with galactic disk stars , the neutron capture elements are distinct enough for us to conclude that pal 1 does have an extragalactic origin .",
    "we now attempt to chemically link pal 1 to its host galaxy , as has been done with e.g. pal 12 @xcite and ter 7 @xcite .",
    "in particular we examine the chemical abundances of the cma overdensity , the gass , and the lmc intermediate - age clusters .    given the low [ la / fe ] abundance in the gass , it is not likely that pal 1 is a member of this stream .",
    "the few stars analyzed in the cma overdensity are more promising ( even if the stars analyzed so far in cma are more metal - rich ) : the general trends in the @xmath4-abundances , the odd - z elements na , al , cu , and zn , the iron - peak elements ( with the exception of sc and v possibly due to hfs corrections ) , and the neutron capture elements ( possibly with the exception of eu ) are in fair agreement . based on this analysis",
    "it is possible that pal 1 could be associated with this stream , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the slight differences between individual elements could be due to the choices of spectral lines and atomic data .",
    "however , it must be noted that none of these stars are guaranteed members of cma , as disk contamination is extremely likely @xcite . in particular",
    ", the star with an [ fe / h ] closest to pal 1 seems identical to the galactic disk stars , and may not be a true member of the stream .",
    "analyses of more stars in the cma overdensity , particularly in the metallicity range of pal 1 , would help establish potential membership .    a comparison with the lmc intermediate - age clusters must also be considered , as they are also young and metal - poor .",
    "in addition , there are several low - mass gcs that appear to be similar to pal 1 : in their sample of sixteen intermediate - age clusters , @xcite found five with no signs of multiple populations in their cmds , suggesting that they were not massive enough to retain gas for a second generation of stars ( @xcite ; see section [ subsec : cluster ] ) . though the na , al , cu , and zn abundances in these clusters are slightly different from pal 1 , the rest of the elements are in good agreement .",
    "pal 1 does not appear to have been accreted from the lmc ; however , it is possible that its formation mechanisms were similar to the intermediate - age lmc clusters , i.e. that pal 1 was accreted from a dwarf galaxy similar to the lmc .",
    "finally , with the exceptions of [ na / fe ] , [ al / fe ] , [ cu / fe ] , and [ zn / fe ] ( which are all higher in pal 1 ) , pal 1 agrees well with pal 12 and ter 7 in sgr .",
    "thus , regardless of its association with either the gass or cma , we conclude that pal 1 likely originated in a fairly massive dwarf satellite ( i.e. a satellite that had a mass somewhere between sgr and the lmc ) .",
    "detailed chemical abundances have been found for twenty one elements in four red giant stars in the unusual gc palomar 1 .",
    "our findings are summarized as follows :    * pal 1 is an outer halo , young ( @xmath62 gyr ) cluster whose age , metallicity , location , and structural parameters distinguish it from the standard galactic globular or open clusters .",
    "however , pal 1 does appear to be similar to the known extragalactic gcs and ocs that have been accreted during mergers ( i.e. from the sgr dsph ) .",
    "* pal 1 s young age and single stellar population suggest a resemblance to the low - mass intermediate - age lmc clusters .",
    "chemical abundances further suggest that pal 1 may have shared a similar formation history .",
    "* pal 1 shows several unusual chemical characteristics , including * * lower [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios than galactic stars of the same [ fe / h ] * * a lack of evidence for a na / o anticorrelation , though marginally high na is found * * similar [ fe - peak / fe ] ratios to galactic stars * * an excess of second - peak s - process neutron capture elements over first - peak elements * * low [ ba / eu ] and high [ eu/@xmath4 ] values that suggest pal 1 s host galaxy had an additional r - process site ( possibilities could be inhomogeneous mixing , an effectively truncated imf , i.e. one that is missing the most massive stars , or variable nucleosynthetic yields ) . * chemically , pal 1 does not behave like the typical galactic bulge / disk gcs or the old , metal - poor ocs .",
    "the closest agreement seems to be with the sgr clusters pal 12 and ter 7 and the lmc intermediate - age clusters ; however the na , al , cu , and zn abundances do not agree with the lmc or sgr clusters .",
    "* comparing the [ x / fe ] of the pal 1 stars to those of stars in known streams show that * * it is unlikely that pal 1 originated in the galactic anticenter stellar stream , given the differing [ la / fe ] ratios * * pal 1 may have originated in the canis major overdensity , if the [ x / fe ] ratios of the three possible cma stars are extrapolated to slightly more metal - poor stars .",

    "<S> detailed chemical abundances for twenty one elements are presented for four red giants in the anomalous outer halo globular cluster palomar 1 ( @xmath0 kpc , @xmath1 kpc ) using high - resolution ( @xmath2 ) spectra from the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) on the subaru telescope . </S>",
    "<S> pal 1 has long been considered unusual because of its low surface brightness , sparse red giant branch , young age , and its possible association with two extragalactic streams of stars  this paper shows that its chemistry further confirms its unusual nature . </S>",
    "<S> the mean metallicity of the four stars , @xmath3 = -0.60 \\pm 0.01 $ ] , is high for a globular cluster so far from the galactic center , but is low for a typical open cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios , though in agreement with the galactic stars within the @xmath5 errors , agree best with the lower values in dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> no signs of the na / o anticorrelation are detected in pal 1 , though na appears to be marginally high in all four stars . </S>",
    "<S> pal 1 s neutron capture elements are also unusual : its high [ ba / y ] ratio agrees best with dwarf galaxies , implying an excess of second - peak over first - peak s - process elements , while its [ eu/@xmath4 ] and [ ba / eu ] ratios show that pal 1 s contributions from the r - process must have differed in some way from normal galactic stars . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , pal 1 is chemically unusual , as well in its other properties . </S>",
    "<S> pal 1 shares some of its unusual abundance characteristics with the young clusters associated with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy remnant and the intermediate - age lmc clusters , and could be chemically associated with the canis majoris overdensity ; however it does not seem to be similar to the monoceros / galactic anticenter stellar stream . </S>"
