    "the agreement of the scaling behavior of the energy calculated using the utp with interaction strength when compared to these analytic results confirms the accuracy of the utp .",
    "in addition to the analytic approximations , we compare our dmc results with an independent study using the hard disk potential and the same number of particles in ref .",
    "@xcite , labeled gb . we note that their predicted energies are higher than those from our dmc calculations using the hard disk potential , and as dmc is a variational method this indicates that our trial wavefunction is likely more accurate than was available to the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , possibly due to our inclusion of a jastrow factor with variational parameters .",
    "having confirmed the accuracy of the utp we now examine its performance benefits .",
    "the local energy , @xmath151 , is a crucial quantity in dmc calculations @xcite .",
    "the stochastic error in a dmc calculation is proportional to the standard deviation @xmath152 in the local energy distribution , and therefore a smoother local energy will give rise to more accurate results for the same computation time .",
    "[ fig : fermi_gas_var ] shows the standard deviation of the local energy distribution of the trial wave function when using all of our pseudopotentials .",
    "both the utp and tm pseudopotentials benefit from their smoothness in obtaining a lower local energy standard deviation compared to the hard and soft disk potentials . for weak interactions the hard disk potential benefits from an additional jastrow factor term , equation  ( [ eq : jastrow2 ] ) , relative to the soft disk potential , whose height @xmath57 also diverges as @xmath153 .",
    "however for larger interactions the soft disk potential results in a smoother wavefunction than the hard disk potential and therefore has lower local energy variance .",
    "the variance in the local energies diverges for the hard and soft disk potentials for weak interactions , whereas it decays for the utp and tm pseudopotentials .",
    "the standard deviation for the tm pseudopotential is slightly lower than the utp at all interaction strengths , which is understood from the larger size of the potential for the utp in fig .",
    "[ fig : potentials ] compared to the tm pseudopotential .",
    "this behavior is similar to the 3d case reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the reduced variance in the local energy lowers the computational effort @xmath154 required for a dmc calculation , which scales as @xmath155 @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_gas_var ] we see that at intermediate interaction strength @xmath156 the variance of the local energy for the utp is 2.7 and 3.0 times lower than for the soft and hard disk potentials respectively , corresponding to a speedup of 7.5 and 9.1 .",
    "in addition to the lower local energy variance , our pseudopotentials offer an additional speedup .",
    "the dmc estimate of the energy must be extrapolated to zero timestep , and the larger the region of linear dependence of energy on timestep , the larger timestep can be used .",
    "this reduces computational effort even further , as @xmath157 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : timesteps ] we observe that the extent of the linear regime of the error in ground state energy with timestep differs between the pseudopotentials : it extends up to for the hard disk , up to for the soft disk , up to for the utp , and up to for the tm pseudopotential .",
    "this means that the maximum timestep for a calculation with the utp is two and four times larger than for the soft and hard disk potentials respectively . combining this with the reduced variance",
    "we therefore accomplish a total speedup of at least 15 times by using the utp instead of the hard and soft disks .    to summarize , we have demonstrated the importance of using a pseudopotential with scattering properties that accurately describe the contact interaction . for weak interactions",
    "we observe that a divergence in the variance in the local energy severely constrains the accuracy of dmc simulations with soft or hard disk potentials . at strong interactions",
    "these inaccurate potentials introduce a significant bias into the results , such that we were unable to attain the @xmath147 target accuracy in the ground state energy .",
    "however the utp delivers highly accurate results over the full range of interaction strengths and additionally offers 15 times better computational performance .",
    "we therefore recommend the utp as an accurate and efficacious tool for studying the contact interaction in 2d .",
    "we have developed a high - accuracy pseudopotential for the contact interaction in 2d , building on the work of ref .",
    "we have demonstrated that our ultratransferable pseudopotential provides accurate scattering phase shifts , accurate energies for two harmonically confined particles , and we have demonstrated its advantages in many - body simulations .",
    "the energies obtained with our utp are over 10 times more accurate in the repulsive branch of the interaction than is afforded by the hard and soft disk potentials used in recent studies .",
    "moreover , we have demonstrated that for many - body systems our pseudopotential delivers a speedup of at least 15 times in diffusion monte carlo computations , on top of the more accurate result .",
    "the performance and ease of construction of the pseudopotential suggests that it could be widely applicable across first - principles methods beyond quantum monte carlo .",
    "the pseudopotential formalism has already been used to study the coulomb @xcite and dipolar @xcite interactions .",
    "although in this work we have focused on using the pseudopotential to accurately capture the scattering properties of the contact interaction , our formalism allows the further improvement of modeling of quantum gases by calibrating the pseudopotentials to more accurately describe the scattering properties of the underlying feshbach resonance interaction . to next lowest order in scattering wavevector",
    ", this corresponds to including the effective range term essential for describing narrow feshbach resonances , which may exhibit exotic breached superfluidity @xcite , or other interactions with non - zero effective ranges , which are applicable in the study of nucleon reactions @xcite . rather than a description in terms of the scattering phase shift , the pseudopotentials",
    "could instead be calibrated to other scattering properties .",
    "for example , they could be calibrated to the cross - section for elastic scattering measured experimentally via the thermalization rate , or the inelastic loss coefficient , to capture the full physical interaction between particles @xcite .",
