    "although they are not yet high - temperature superconductors , understanding lightly doped antiferromagnets is a great challenge in condensed matter physics . a lot is known about hole- and electron - doped systems both from experiments and from studies of microscopic hubbard or @xmath8-@xmath9-type models @xcite .",
    "based on the work of haldane @xcite and of chakravarty , halperin , and nelson @xcite who described the low - energy magnon physics by a @xmath10-d @xmath11-invariant nonlinear @xmath12-model , several attempts have been made to include charge carriers in the effective theory @xcite .",
    "however , conflicting results have been obtained .",
    "for example , the various approaches differ in the fermion field content of the effective theory and in how various symmetries are realized on those fields . in particular ,",
    "it has not yet been established that any of the effective theories proposed so far indeed correctly describes the low - energy physics of the underlying microscopic systems in a quantitative manner .    in analogy to chiral perturbation theory for the pseudo - nambu - goldstone pions of qcd @xcite , the @xmath10-d @xmath11-invariant",
    "nonlinear @xmath12-model has been established as a systematic and quantitatively correct low - energy effective field theory in the pure magnon sector @xcite . in analogy",
    "to baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite  the effective theory for pions and nucleons  we have recently extended the pure magnon effective theory by including charge carriers @xcite .",
    "the effective theory provides a powerful theoretical framework in which the low - energy physics of magnons and charge carriers can be addressed in a systematic manner .",
    "the predictions of the effective theory are universal and apply to a large class of doped antiferromagnets .",
    "this is in contrast to calculations in microscopic models which usually suffer from uncontrolled approximations and are limited to just one underlying system .",
    "while some results obtained with the effective theory can be obtained directly from microscopic systems , the effective field theory treatment allows us to derive such results in a systematic and more transparent manner and it puts them on a solid theoretical basis . in order not to obscure the basic physics of magnons and charge carriers , the effective theory has been based on microscopic systems that share the symmetries of hubbard or @xmath8-@xmath9-type models .",
    "in particular , effects of impurities , long - range coulomb forces , anisotropies , or small couplings between different @xmath13 layers have so far been neglected , but can be added whenever this becomes desirable . before such effects have been included , one should be aware of the fact that the effective theory does not describe the actual materials in all details .",
    "still , for systems that share the symmetries of the hubbard or @xmath8-@xmath9 model , the effective theory makes predictions that are exact , order by order in a systematic low - energy expansion .",

    "the location of these pockets again has important effects on the electron dynamics , which turns out to be quite different from that of the holes .",
    "in particular , in contrast to hole - doped systems , in electron - doped antiferromagnets the magnon - mediated forces between two electrons depend on the total momentum @xmath3 of the pair . for @xmath4 the one - magnon exchange potential between two electrons at distance",
    "@xmath5 is proportional to @xmath6 , while in the hole case it has a @xmath7 dependence .",
    "the different locations of electron and hole pockets also affect the phase structure . while spiral phases are possible in the hole - doped case @xcite , they are absent in electron - doped cuprates @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the symmetries of charge carrier fields are summarized .",
    "based on this , the electron fields are identified and the hole fields are eliminated . the low - energy effective action for magnons and electrons is then constructed in a systematic manner .",

    "this is also illustrated in figure 7 , in which the energies @xmath165 and @xmath180 combine to form two overlapping parabolic dispersion relations .    as a result , eq.([etot ] ) is still valid even when the occupied circles overlap .",

    "let us also calculate the effect of the 4-fermion contact interactions on the energy density .",
    "we perform this calculation to first order of perturbation theory , assuming that the 4-fermion interactions are weak . depending on the underlying microscopic system such as the hubbard model , the 4-fermion couplings may or may not be small .",
    "we like to point out that , while the on - site coulomb repulsion responsible for antiferromagnetism is always large in the microscopic systems , the 4-fermion couplings in the effective theory may still be small . if they are large , the result of the perturbative calculation should not be trusted .",
    "the perturbation of the hamiltonian due to the leading 4-fermion contact term of eq.([lagrange ] ) is given by @xmath181 it should be noted that @xmath182 and @xmath183 again are fermion creation and annihilation operators ( and not grassmann numbers ) .",

    "the order parameter of the undoped antiferromagnet is the local staggered magnetization @xmath188 with @xmath189 being the length of the staggered magnetization vector . in a doped antiferromagnet",
    "the staggered magnetization receives additional contributions from the electrons such that @xmath190 \\vec e(x).\\ ] ] the low - energy parameter @xmath65 determines the reduction of the staggered magnetization upon doping .",
    "further contributions to @xmath191 which include derivatives or contain more than two fermion fields are of higher order and have thus been neglected . using @xmath192",
    "we then obtain @xmath193 i.e.  at leading order the staggered magnetization decreases linearly with increasing electron density .",
    "the higher - order terms that we have neglected will give rise to sub - leading corrections of @xmath194 .",
    "in analogy to the hole - doped case @xcite , we have constructed a systematic effective field theory for lightly electron - doped antiferromagnets .",
    "interestingly , the different locations of electron- and hole - pockets in the brillouin zone have important consequences for the dynamics .    in the hole - doped case ,",
    "the pockets are located at @xmath195 which gives rise to a flavor index that determines to which pocket a hole belongs . due to spontaneous symmetry breaking , holes and magnons are derivatively coupled .",
    "the leading magnon - hole coupling contains a single spatial derivative and is responsible for a variety of interesting effects .",
    "first , it leads to a @xmath7 potential between a pair of holes which gives rise to an infinite number of two - hole bound states @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in the hole - doped case , in the @xmath196 limit the symmetries give rise to an accidental galilean boost invariance .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to consider the bound state in its rest - frame .",
    "second , in the hole - doped systems , the single - derivative magnon - hole coupling gives rise to a spiral phase for intermediate values of @xmath76 .    in the electron - doped case discussed in this paper ,",
    "the momentum space pockets are located at @xmath1 and @xmath2 . due to antiferromagnetism",
    "these are actually two half - pockets which combine to a single electron - pocket .",
    "hence , in contrast to the hole - doped systems , electrons do not carry an additional flavor index .",
    "as in the hole - case , electrons and magnons are derivatively coupled . however , due to the different implementation of the symmetries , the leading magnon - electron coupling now contains two spatial derivatives . in other words , at low energies magnons are coupled to holes more strongly than to electrons . as a consequence , the one - magnon exchange potential between two electrons in their rest - frame decays as @xmath6 and is hence weaker at large distances than in the hole - case . still , magnon exchange is capable of binding electrons . as another consequence of symmetry considerations ,",
    "an accidental galilean boost invariance is absent in the electron - case .",
    "indeed , the one - magnon exchange potential depends on the total momentum @xmath3 of the electron - pair , and it is hence not sufficient to consider the system in its rest - frame .",
    "the momentum - dependent contribution to the potential is proportional to @xmath197 , which gives rise to a non - trivial structure of moving bound states . as another consequence of the weakness of the magnon - electron coupling , in contrast to the hole - doped case ,",
    "spiral phases are energetically unfavorable for electron - doped systems .",
    "while this is not a new result , we find it remarkable that it follows unambiguously from the very few basic assumptions of the systematic low - energy effective field theory , such as locality , symmetry , and unitarity .",
    "we like to point out that the systematic effective field theory approach is universally applicable to a large class of antiferromagnets .",
    "while it remains to be seen if the effective theory can also be applied to high - temperature superconductors , it makes unbiased , quantitative predictions for both lightly hole- and electron - doped cuprates and should be pursued further .",
