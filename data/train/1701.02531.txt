    "sunspots are regions of concentrated strong magnetic fields comprising of dark central region , umbra surrounded by a less darker region called the penumbra .",
    "penumbral microjets ( pmjs ) are one of the prominent fine - structure dynamical features observed in the sunspot at the chromospheric height . using the sot @xcite  h filter images , @xcite first reported that these micro - jets occur ubiquitously above penumbra .",
    "they have lengths of 1  to  4  mm and lifetimes of up to a minute .",
    "they generally move very fast and have apparent speeds over 100  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the magnetic field in the chromospheric penumbral region consists of a combination of spines ( more vertical field ) and interspines ( more horizontal field ) .",
    "@xcite found that pmjs generally originate near the bright structures in between two dark penumbral filaments and propagate upward along the direction of the spine .",
    "so , they proposed that pmjs could originate as a result of magnetic reconnection between the spine and interspine magnetic fields .        using the iris @xcite observations",
    ", @xcite found the presence of subarcsecond bright dots ( bds ) above sunspot penumbra in the tr .",
    "they appear ubiquitously and mostly have a lifetime less than few minutes .",
    "they sometimes appear slightly elongated along the penumbral filaments and also move along the filaments with speeds of 1040  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "they proposed that some of them could be due to impulsive reconnection in the tr and chromosphere at footpoints of coronal magnetic loops and others are probably due to falling plasma .",
    "it is still unclear how bds are formed and if they show any signatures in the lower and upper atmosphere .",
    "@xcite studied the multi - wavelength signatures of pmjs and found that pmjs show spatial offset from the chromosphere to tr in the direction of the pmj .",
    "hence , they proposed that pmjs may progressively heat up to tr temperature .",
    "@xcite could not find noticeable signature of normal pmjs in any atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) @xcite passbands , although a few strong and large pmjs show bd / bd - like signatures in the 1600    and high - resolution coronal imager ( hi - c ) 193    images .",
    "@xcite found that bds observed in hi - c are on average slower , dimmer , larger in size and longer lived than iris penumbral bds .",
    "they also found that most of the bds observed in hi - c 193    may correspond to tr .",
    "@xcite found that the locations of most of the penumbral bds show downflow .",
    "their statistical analysis shows that bds do not have consistent brightening response in the chromosphere .",
    "following @xcite , they also suggested that tr penumbral bds are manifestation of falling plasma from coronal heights along more vertical and dense magnetic loops or small - scale impulsive magnetic reconnection at tr or higher heights . @xcite and observed heating events which are associated with the strong downflows in the tr and proposed a similar scenario . @xcite",
    "have studied small transient brightening events in the penumbra and found that it show redshifts in the  1402.77    line , an inward motion towards the umbra in iris 1400    images and have a multi - thermal component .",
    "they proposed the triggering mechanism as magnetic reconnection at low coronal heights .",
    "a component of the plasma from the reconnection site may move downward and reach the tr , which is confirmed by the observed redshifts in the  1402.77    line and the inward motions as seen in the iris 1400    images .",
    "finally , it reaches the chromosphere and appears as ribbon - like brightening . in this work , while combining multi - wavelength observations covering chromosphere , tr / corona we try to find the source of the bds and their relation to pmjs .",
    "we use the data obtained from a coordinated observation taken on 19 march 2014 , using the hinode / sot ( hop-250 ) @xcite , iris ( iris-3840007453 ) @xcite and the aia @xcite on board the solar dynamics observatory .",
    "the coordinated observation between all the instruments was performed from 08:51  ut to 09:46  ut .",
    "we selected a fov of @xmath1x@xmath2 centered at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the fov is limited due to the sot observations .",
    "iris slit - jaw images ( sji ) centered at 2796   and 1400   are dominated by the  k and emission lines , respectively .",
    "the sot filter is dominated by  h line , which forms at the lower chromosphere where the temperature is below 10@xmath5 k. the iris 2796   images are dominated by the emission from a plasma at temperatures @xmath610,000 - 15,000 k and represent the middle chromosphere .",
    "the iris 1400   passband is sensitive to tr @xmath660,000 - 80,000 k. aia filtergram images centered at 304   ( sensitive to @xmath60.05  mk ) and 193   ( @xmath61.25  mk ) are dominated by and emission lines , respectively .",
    "sot  h data was taken with 0.3  sec exposure and 1.58  sec cadence .",
    "iris sji s were obtained with 4  sec exposure and a cadence of 10.5  sec .",
    "aia 304   and 193   observations were taken with 2 sec exposure and 12 sec cadence .",
    "aia data were then co - aligned and de - rotated to the start time ( 08:51  ut ) of observation to compensate for the solar rotation .",
    "the pixel size of sot , sji s and aia are @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we have interpolated sot and aia data in space and time to match the iris sji cadence ( 10.50 sec ) and spatial resolution ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the iris sjis and sot images were co - aligned using iris 2796   and sot  h images .",
    "the time difference between the sot and iris image is of the order of sub - seconds .",
    "after that iris and aia were co - aligned using iris 1400   and aia 1600   images @xcite .",
    "figure  [ sot_iris_aia ] shows the image of a sunspot , where the bottom rows ( g - k ) correspond to running difference images .",
    "the yellow contours show the location of bds in the sunspot penumbra .",
    "these contours are obtained from the 1400   image after subtracting the same image with a 8x8 pixel smoothing .",
    "evolution of two bds inside the box b1 and b2 ( as marked in 1400  ) are shown in the figure  [ ev_b1ab2 ] ( also in online movie ) .",
    "the bds inside the box b1 including box b11 , b12 and b13 are related to pmjs .",
    "the bd inside b2 is not related to any visible dynamics in the sot .",
    "figure  [ ev_b1ab2 ] depicts the temporal evolution of two bds .",
    "shows the evolution of the bd inside the b1 box in the figure  [ sot_iris_aia ] .",
    "panel a , c and e show the evolution as seen in the iris 1400  , sot  h and iris 2796  , whereas the b , d and f correspond to running difference images",
    ". the clear presence of a bd is seen in the in the 1400  .",
    "a jet like feature is also seen in the  h and 2796   images .",
    "similarly , show the evolution of the b2 region as marked in the figure  [ sot_iris_aia ] .",
    "here , we can clearly find the presence of a bd in the 1400   channel but no clear signature of intensity enhancement in the  h. we have identified several bds and performed a statistical analysis to compile the properties of these bds and their signatures in the other channels . at first , we identify manually an isolated bd and look for the time frame where it shows maximum intensity enhancement .",
    "we use that as our central frame and make a movie ( see animated figure of fig .",
    "[ ev_b1ab2 ] , covering a 5x5  mm region for a duration of 210 sec ) to follow the bds and their direction of propagation .",
    "the bds often show apparent movements along the bright filamentary structures roughly in the radial direction of the sunspot .        now to find the properties of the bds , we follow a similar method as used by @xcite .",
    "two examples of the analysis are shown in figure  [ xt_b1ab2 ]  &  .",
    "we have studied 180 penumbral bds and try to find if they have any signature in the sot  h and iris 2796   channels .",
    "we use the central image to compute the intensity enhancement , length and width of a bd , as shown in figure  [ xt_b1ab2 ]  .",
    "we plot the intensities along the green cut and red cut ( panel a ) .",
    "the green cut is placed along the radial direction and the red cut is perpendicular to it .",
    "the intensity values are shown by red and green diamond symbols . a fitted gaussian is also overplotted with the same color .",
    "the fwhm of the green profile provides an estimate of the length of the bd , whereas the red profile provides the width .",
    "percentage intensity enhancement is calculated from the peak intensity and the linear background of the fitted gaussian .",
    "the smallest between the two values ( green and red ) measures the intensity enhancement .",
    "we plot space - time ( xt ) diagram ( panel  c ) to study their temporal behavior and to measure their apparent speed .",
    "a 2@xmath11 intensity contour is drawn on the xt map .",
    "the inclined blue line is drawn inside the contour to measure the apparent velocity and lifetime of the bd .",
    "the starting time of the blue line is considered as the initiation of the bd .",
    "the long intensity strip at the center of the xt map is due to high intensity enhancement at that particular time frame .",
    "we follow a similar method for the  h and 2796   channels ( d and g ) .",
    "the intensity enhancement in these channels is only a few percent and very difficult to find the location of the intensity enhancement .",
    "so , we use the running difference images to place our green and red cut ( see e and h ) on the original images .         the xt map is produced after removing a smoothed background from each images .",
    "an elongated bright structure is seen in the xt plot .",
    "these have been conventionally referred as penumbral micro - jets ( pmjs ) by @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of these jets are very small .",
    "most of them appear as sudden brightening in the xt plot and hence it is very difficult to determine their direction of propagation and the speed . in this work",
    "we do not focus on the speed of these jets . using earlier convention",
    "we have assumed that these brightenings are propagating outward form the sunspot , though it is not clearly established from our analysis that the bright structures are moving outward from the sunspot .",
    "we use a 2@xmath11 intensity contour to find the location and extent of the pmj .",
    "the blue line is drawn along the direction of intensity enhancement .",
    "the starting time of the blue line is considered as the initiation and the length of the line is considered as the length of the pmj .",
    "we can clearly see that the bd appears before the pmj in this example .",
    "similarly , in figure  [ xt_b1ab2 ] , we study another bd .",
    "following same methodology we study the evolution of the bd .",
    "we could not find a clear signature of the bd in the  h though a faint signature is seen in the 2796   channel . in the following subsection",
    "a statistical study is performed to find out if there are two types bds present in our data .",
    "we analyze the properties of many bds and their signature in the other channels . out of the total 180 events ,",
    "90 are identified as having a correlated signature in the ca ii h and 2796   channels , while the other 90 do not .",
    "we have separated these two classes so as to find out if they have any significant differences in their physical properties .",
    "figure  [ stat_bd ] ( a)-(f ) show the distributions of the observed parameters .",
    "the red color in the histograms represent the bds which do not have a counterpart in the  h images whereas the blue represent the bds which are related to the  h pmjs .",
    "the mean value of each of the parameters for both the types are also printed .",
    "we find that the bds which are related to pmjs , generally , are longer and have higher intensity enhancements .",
    "they are also more elongated ( the ratio between length and width is higher ) .",
    "one of the distinguishable feature is that most of the bds which are related to pmjs show negative velocities ( drifts towards the center of the sunspot ) .",
    "we have also calculated a few physical parameters of pmjs .",
    "the position and length of each pmjs are measured in both the 2796   and  h channels .",
    "the starting point of the pmjs is considered as the location close to the center of the sunspot .",
    "the locations of the pmj as seen in the  h and 2796  are marked ( yellow arrows ) in the figures  [ pos]a , b respectively .",
    "the length of the arrow measures the length of the pmjs .",
    "the bds which are related to these pmjs are also shown by the small dots .",
    "red represents the dots which moves inward and blue represents those that move outward from the sunspot center .",
    "the pmjs as seen in 2796   generally show spatial offset from the  h pmjs along the pmjs direction ( outer penumbral side ) . in figure  [ pos]c",
    ", we show the location of the bds which are not related to any pmjs .",
    "figure  [ pos](d ) show the distribution of the length of the pmjs as seen in the 2796    and  h images .",
    "the pmjs in  h have similar value as reported by @xcite though they appear little longer in the 2796    images .",
    "figure  [ pos](e ) show the distribution of the length between the bds and the footpoint of the pmjs and figure  [ pos](f ) show the time delay between the appearance of the bds and pmjs .",
    "a negative value means bds appear earlier than the pmjs .",
    "we find that most of the bds appear before the pmjs .",
    "we have analyzed the properties of 180 bds as seen in the 1400   images above a sunspot . using our coordinated observation ,",
    "we have also positively identified pmjs in the sot  h and iris 2796    images .",
    "we find that 90 bds are related to pmjs whereas others are not .",
    "a detail analysis show that the bds which are related are generally longer and more elongated and have higher intensity enhancements .",
    "most of these bds show negative velocities ( moves inward direction ) and appear at top of the pmjs .",
    "these bds are found to be appearing before the generation of the pmjs .",
    "these results may indicate that bds could originate from a magnetic reconnection occurring at low coronal heights and/or due to falling plasma .",
    "a component of the plasma from the reconnection site may move downwards and reach the tr and show inward motion as seen in the iris 1400    images . finally , it reaches the chromosphere and appears as ribbon - like brightening ( pmj ) which could explain the time delay in the appearance of the pmjs and their short lifetime .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite proposed that this kind of small magnetic reconnection occurs in the low corona .",
    "this is in contrast to the reconnection model as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the progressive heating mechanism of the pmjs as proposed by @xcite also may not explain the inward motions of the bds , appearance of bds before pmjs and the longer lifetime of the bds .",
    "it is still unclear how the non - related bds originate .",
