    "helical dirac fermions , massless relativistic charged particles with spin locked to their linear momentum , are proposed to exist on the surface of three dimensional topological insulators ( tis)@xcite and later confirmed in experiments@xcite on samples like bi@xmath1se@xmath2 and bi@xmath3sb@xmath4 . for compounds such as hgte and bi@xmath1se@xmath2 , surfaces with a single dirac cone have been found@xcite .",
    "while the low energy spectrum is very similar to that of graphene , the difference in the microscopic origin of the phenomena points to subtle differences .",
    "for example , the presence of a single dirac cone in tis , as opposed to two doubly degenerate ones in graphene , leads to significant reduction in phase space at low energies .",
    "furthermore , the coupling of physical spin , rather than pseudospin ( related to sublattice symmetry ) , in tis suggests that the response in magnetic fields will be markedly different .",
    "the key property of the surface states of tis is the magnetoelectric effect .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of bulk carriers has made it hard to observe it in transport measurements@xcite .",
    "one way to overcome this is to identify unique signatures , in transport , of the surface states .",
    "in particular the anomalous dependence of transport coefficients on the gyromagnetic ratio ( g - factor ) can be exploited to this end .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the anomalous contribution can be enhanced by applying an in plane electric field@xcite . in this article",
    "we study the thermopower and magnetotransport properties of these surface dirac fermions in the presence of randomly distributed impurities .    in the conventional two dimensional electron gas under a quantizing magnetic field",
    ", the diagonal thermopower , @xmath5 , of the clean sample at low temperatures shows a series of peaks near the landau levels @xmath6 .",
    "the peak values are @xmath7 independent of magnetic field strength@xcite .",
    "one of our goals is to show how these universal features are modified in graphene and tis .    for electrons exhibiting a dirac spectrum , such as graphene",
    ", this height of @xmath5 is expected to vary as @xmath8 , as required by the berry phase effects leading to a @xmath9 integer shift in the landau level index@xcite .",
    "we verify this result for @xmath10 and discuss the singular behavior near @xmath11 .",
    "we use self consistent born approximation ( scba ) to consider the effect of short ranged , randomly distributed impurities on transport and magnetotransport@xcite of the dirac fermions and compute diagonal and off diagonal thermopower numerically .",
    "similar to the results in conventional 2d metals , the height of @xmath5 at low temperature does not have universal value after the inclusion of impurities@xcite .    we also show that for intermediate impurity strength , not considered in previous studies which have focused on the unitarity limit@xcite , the particle hole symmetry of the original dirac spectrum is broken under scba while for weak and strong impurity strength the particle hole symmetry is restored .",
    "another source of scattering in graphene is charged coulomb impurities and its effect on conductivity and thermopower , both within perturbation@xcite and scba@xcite , have been extensively studied .",
    "comparison to available data@xcite suggests that a single scattering mechanism can not account for all observed features@xcite .",
    "our formulation for tis , with the g - factor set to zero , is similar to the case of graphene .",
    "thus , in addition to exploring the difference in the transport properties induced by the spin orbit coupling , we can also compare our prediction with the available data .",
    "qualitative agreement with thermopower data is obtained for all but the zeroth landau level .",
    "the failure is related to the underestimation of the longitudinal conductivity .",
    "the important new feature in topological insulators , as compared to graphene , is the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in addition to orbital quantization , an external magnetic field couples to the momentum via its zeeman coupling with the spin .",
    "such an interaction reveals itself in novel signatures in transport unique to topological insulators .",
    "for example , the universal amplitudes in thermopower depend on the gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath0 ) , but no splitting of peaks occurs as the surface states are derived from a single dirac cone . while the dimensional coupling constant @xmath12 is quite small for @xmath13 ( of order @xmath14 ) to yield a measurable signature , we derive the expected behavior in a model system where @xmath15 is enhanced by an order of magnitude .",
    "the enhancement is achievable in principle by applying an inplane electric field@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ s2 ] we describe the general hamiltonian and t - matrix formulation used to perturbatively compute the effects of impurities . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we present our results , within linear response , for conductivity and the diagonal thermopower @xmath5 in the absence of magnetic fields . in sec .",

    "a hole / electron peak between @xmath11 and @xmath236 is observed instead .",

    "analytic results of thermopower in the clean limit , i.e. impurity strength @xmath156 , are given in both cases .",
    "in the case of zero magnetic field the thermopower obtained is still susceptible to impurity interaction and does not show universal feature . in the case of finite magnetic field",

    "we also vary the impurity potential and study its affect on transport . for moderate impurity strength @xmath26",
    "we find the particle hole symmetry is broken while for large or small @xmath26 the symmetry is restored in our perturbation formulation .    due to the lack of available data on thermopower measurement of the helical metal",
    ", we compare our thermopower results with experimental data on graphene .",
    "our computation is on the helical metal system which differs from graphene@xcite mainly in the zeeman effect .",
    "since the zeeman contribution is small for normal magnetic field strength ( due to @xmath237 ) in both graphene and helical metal samples such as hgte , our results are applicable to the case of graphene with short range , randomly positioned impurities modulo a numerical factor in conductivity due to valley and spin degeneracy in graphene .",
    "we find qualitative agreement between our numerical results of thermopower and experimental results in graphene , except for the @xmath5 near the zeroth landau level .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the enhanced diagonal conductivity nearby zeroth landau level .",
    "the enhancement in @xmath221 seems to decrease with increasing magnetic field@xcite .",
    "possible mechanism includes the metal to insulator transition on the zeroth landau level@xcite or electron hole puddles @xcite .",
    "transport measurements of graphene near the minimum conductivity in ref .   partly supports the latter mechanism but further study is needed to clarify this issue . whether similar behavior is reproduced in helical metals",
    "is an open question .",
    "the magneto - electric coupling , unique to topological insulators , leads to novel features in transport .",
    "the dependence of the thermopower on the zeeman coupling provides a diagnostic of the state . to amplify the expected behavior we have analyzed thermopower and nernst for materials with an artificially enhanced gyromagnetic ratio .",
