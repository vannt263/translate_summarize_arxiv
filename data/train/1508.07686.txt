    "for excited strange heavy mesons @xmath6 , pion and/or photon emissions are the dominant decay modes which determine their lifetimes @xcite . of these decay modes , the radiative decay , @xmath7 , and the only kinematically allowed strong decay , @xmath8 , which is the isospin - violating mode ,",
    "have been observed , and the branching ratio @xmath9 has been measured by the cleo @xcite and babar collaborations @xcite .",
    "the latter collaboration obtained @xmath10 , which was a significant improvement over the former one .",
    "this precise value provides an ideal occasion to test different theoretical estimations for the strong and electromagnetic interactions of strange heavy mesons .    in 1989 , it was realized that , in low - energy situations where the typical gluon momenta are small compared with the heavy quark mass @xmath11 , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) dynamics becomes independent of the flavor ( mass ) and spin of the heavy quark @xcite .",
    "these new spin and flavor symmetries combine to form an @xmath12 symmetry , called heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) , which is not manifest in the original qcd lagrangian .",
    "hqs allows us to factorize the complicated light quark and gluon dynamics from that of the heavy one , and thus provides a clearer physical picture in the study of heavy quark physics . beyond the symmetry limit",
    ", a heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) can be developed by systematically expanding the qcd lagrangian in powers of @xmath0 , with which hqs breaking effects can be studied order by order @xcite . although the development of hqet from qcd has simplified the analysis of heavy hadron physics , many properties of hadrons , for example , their decay constants and axial coupling constants , are still not calculable directly from qcd . to study these quantities , one unavoidably has to use phenomenological models to describe the structures of hadrons .",
    "these include the constituent quark model ( cqm ) @xcite , the mit bag model @xcite , the lattice qcd calculations @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , and the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) @xcite . in spite of the fact that the cqm and the mit bag models have been widely used , the results calculated from these two models are trustworthy only for processes involving small momentum transfers .",
    "the lfqm is a relativistic quark model with simple boost kinematics which allows us to describe physical processes with large momentum transfers .",
    "however , this model is not a fully lorentz covariant @xcite , and this defect limits its usefulness to matrix elements with space - like momentum transfers ( @xmath13 ) only .",
    "moreover , the lfqm is not capable of handling the so - called z - diagrams @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a covariant light - front model of heavy mesons has been suggested .",
    "however , the approach taken there is not systematic , and light - quark currents are not considered . to overcome the drawbacks mentioned above",
    ", a covariant field theoretical model has been proposed for the heavy meson bound state problem @xcite .",
    "this model is fully covariant and satisfies hqs ; at the same time , it retains the simplicity of the quark model picture .",
    "this theory allows us to formulate theoretical calculations in terms of the standard feynman diagrams .",
    "therefore , the lack of z - diagrams in the ordinary lfqm is no longer a problem . combining this model with hqet",
    ", we can systematically study various @xmath0 corrections to heavy meson properties in the framework of perturbative field theory .    in the other extreme , due to the relatively small light - quark masses @xmath14",
    ", the light - quark sector of the qcd lagrangian obeys an approximate @xmath15 chiral symmetry @xcite . due to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , there exist eight pseudoscalar bosons ( called goldstone bosons , which include three @xmath16 s , four @xmath17 s , and one @xmath18 ) , whose dynamics obeys the @xmath15 chiral symmetry . if we want to study the low - energy interactions of heavy hadrons and goldstone bosons , we need to build an effective theory that obeys both chiral and heavy quark symmetries .",
    "this was done in references @xcite , where chiral symmetry and hqs were synthesized in a single effective chiral lagrangian which described the strong interactions between heavy hadrons and goldstone bosons .",
    "the theory has since been extended to incorporate electromagnetic interactions as well @xcite . in principle , the effective chiral lagrangian provides an ideal framework in which to study the strong decay mode .",
    "however , symmetry considerations alone , in general , do not lead to quantitative predictions , unless further assumptions are made to extract the values of the various coupling constants appearing in the lagrangian .",
    "furthermore , the framework of an effective chiral lagrangian does not allow for a systematic discussion of hqs violating @xmath0 effects , which is important for a thorough understanding of heavy quark physics .",
    "in fact , in the heavy - light @xmath19 system , there are three different types of symmetry breaking mechanisms : ( 1 ) hqs breaking from @xmath0 corrections , ( 2 ) @xmath1 symmetry breaking due to strange quark mass @xmath20 , and ( 3 ) @xmath2 symmetry breaking due to the up - down quark mass difference @xmath21 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to systematically study these symmetry breaking effects in a covariant model for the strong and radiative decays of strange heavy mesons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the covariant model , which is based on hqet . some heavy meson properties in the heavy quark limit and @xmath0 corrections",
    "are considered .",
    "the numerical calculations and discussions are expressed in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the covariant model starts from hqet in the heavy quark limit @xmath22 and describes a heavy meson as a composite particle , consisting of a reduced heavy quark coupled with a brown muck of light degrees of freedom .",
    "it is formulated in an effective lagrangian approach , so that it is fully covariant , and we can use feynman diagrammatic techniques to evaluate various processes .      using the @xmath0 expansion to the heavy quark qcd lagrangian @xcite , the qcd lagrangian for heavy and light quarks plus gluons can be written as @xmath23 , where l_0&= &    l_m_q&=&_n=1^()^n|h_v i d _ ( -i v d)^n-1 i d_h_v , [ expand ] @xmath24 is orthogonal to the heavy quark velocity , @xmath25 is responsible for binding a heavy quark and a light quark in the heavy quark limit , and @xmath26 contains @xmath0 corrections to @xmath25 .",
    "the effective lagrangian we have constructed to describe the low - energy dynamics of pseudoscalar heavy mesons reads @xcite : l_=l+_v^(iv-2|)_v-|h_v i_5 q_v _ v + where @xmath27 represent the composite pseudoscalar heavy meson fields which appear only as external states , |_m_q m_m - m_q [ lambda ] is their residual mass in the heavy quark limit , q_v = g f(-iv ) q represents collectively the degrees of freedom in a heavy meson , where @xmath28 is a form factor whose presence is expected for an effective interaction resulting from the non - perturbative qcd dynamics , and @xmath29 is the normalization constant given by g^-2 = i f^2(vp ) .",
    "[ gno ] at this point , we note that @xmath30 is analogous to the meson wave function in the lfqm , and @xmath29 is the corresponding normalization constant . to explicitly evaluate @xmath29 and other physical quantities , we need to specify the structure function @xmath30 , which is unfortunately not calculable from first principles .",
    "nevertheless , from the constraints that @xmath28 does not depend on the heavy quark residual momentum and it forbids on - shell dissociation of the heavy meson into @xmath31 , a plausible form for @xmath28 is : f(vp ) = ( vp ) ( |-vp ) , [ ff ] where the function @xmath32 does not have a pole at @xmath33 .    within this framework ,",
    "hadronic matrix elements are calculated via standard feynman diagrams where heavy mesons always appear as external legs .",

    "all the other feynman rules are the same as in qcd and hqet .",
    "thus , if the power of @xmath38 in the wave function @xmath39 is less than @xmath40 , this model will work well .",
    "after building a covariant framework to describe heavy meson structures , we go on to evaluate some of the basic heavy meson properties .",
    "these include the decay constant , the @xmath0 corrections of the heavy meson mass , and the axial - vector and electromagnetic coupling constants of strange heavy mesons .",

    "<S> the value of the @xmath3 mixing vertex has some changes because of the renewed data . as compared with the other theoretical calculations and the experimental data , our radiative decay rates are much larger than those of the other theoretical methods , except for @xmath5pt ; however , our branching ratios are close to the experimental data .    1.4 cm </S>"
