    "after a long quest , the epoch of reionization has been discovered as a protracted period reaching from @xmath2 ( kogut et al . 2003 ; becker et al . 2001 ) .",
    "prior to @xmath0 , the universe was optically opaque , but galaxy formation was well underway . since it is impossible to study this ` grey age ' of the universe optically , observing the @xmath1 universe is the primary science driver for the near - ir - optimized ngst .",
    "however , well before ngst flies , great progress can be expected if radio and millimetre telescopes can be targeted on quasars observed within the reionization epoch .",
    "radio - loud targets allow absorption studies that can probe the evolving neutral and molecular content of the high-@xmath3 universe ( e.g. carilli , gnedin , & owen 2002 ) , and radio hi absorption is the _ only _ way of probing the neutral gas which goes on to form stars .",
    "we could begin these studies with current facilities ( e.g.  the gbt and gmrt ) , but we desperately need measurements of space density to influence the design of next - generation instruments like lofar and the ska . unfortunately , there are currently no known @xmath1 radio - loud objects .",
    "this is because such objects are rare  a tiny fraction ( @xmath4 per cent ) of the radio population .",
    "interest in pursuing them was dampened by the claim of a much sharper cut - off in their redshift distribution ( shaver et al .",
    "1996 ) than earlier work ( dunlop & peacock 1990 ) had suggested .",
    "jarvis & rawlings ( 2000 ) and jarvis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have re - examined all the evidence concerning this redshift cutoff , obtaining results strongly favouring a fairly gradual decline with redshift .",
    "jarvis & rawlings ( 2000 ) emphasized the care needed in sample selection and analysis . the survey should be selected at low frequency to avoid losing the highest-@xmath3 quasars because of the steepening of radio spectra at high rest - frame frequencies .",
    "the only low - frequency ( 325 mhz ) survey with the required depth and sky coverage is wenss / wish ( rengelink et al.1997 ; de breuck et al .",
    "2002 ) ; its sky coverage and the galactic plane forces us to the area shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) ( the upper declination limit of @xmath5 is due to consideration of the ukirt declination limit ) .",
    "analysis must account for distributions in the radio spectral shapes of the population as highlighted by jarvis et al .",
    "our latest data - constrained model has been the basis of simulations to test potential selection criteria for the fs population , yielding optimum flux density and spectral index cuts .",
    "adopting these cuts there are @xmath6 candidates in our ` quarter - sky ' survey of which @xmath7 per cent will be at @xmath8 .",
    "our work allows us to quantify uncertainties in extrapolating the number of @xmath1 radio quasars from @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear we should focus on fs rather than ss sources because :    * their more favourable @xmath10-correction and luminosity function [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] flattens their high-@xmath3 distribution .",
    "* at the highest @xmath3 they are mostly quasars [ fig .  1(b ) ] , so getting redshifts is relatively easy ( c.f .",
    "impossibly - faint high-@xmath3 ss radio galaxies ! ) .",
    "* they are compact , so nvss positions yield reliable identifications . * any relativistic beaming effects due to their probable orientation along our line - of - sight means we probe much further down the radio luminosity function , towards the bulk of the radio - loud quasar luminosity density ( e.g. willott et al . 2001 ) .",
    "there is a challenging , but tractable , sifting problem to eliminate both galaxies and quasars at @xmath11 .",
    "this is done in four steps .",
    "\\(i ) we have cross - correlated the radio sample with publicly available all - sky optical and near - ir imaging , i.e.  sdss , poss and 2mass , along with more general searches of known objects via the literature and ned . from this investigation",
    "we have optical ids for about 67% of the objects in the northern sample ( comprising quasars , low - redshift galaxies , bl lac objects etc . ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath12 objects have no detectable optical emission , typically to @xmath13 .",
    "\\(ii ) we have initiated deeper targeted observations in @xmath14band of the remaining @xmath15 northern sources with igi at the 2.7  m at mcdonald observatory .",
    "preliminary observations of @xmath16 sources down to @xmath17 ( depending on conditions ) has shown that of the remaining 1500 sources , approximately 60 - 70% are detected .",
    "these sources , generally extended objects which are presumably @xmath18 radio galaxies , are obviously not at @xmath8 , because like the @xmath0 quasars already known ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2003 ) , these must have zero flux below the redshifted lyman limit .",
    "\\(iii ) we use good - seeing near - ir imaging to find all the remaining quasars , and eliminate all the remaining galaxies .",
    "[ this works because , e.g.  fig .",
    "1(b ) , the quasar fraction in the fs population drops precipitously to lower redshifts ( @xmath19 ) : indeed most fs sources at the depth of our survey will be galaxies ( mckean et al .",
    "2000 ) ; 10 nights on ukirt have already been allocated . ] .",
    "\\(iv ) we take near - ir spectra and find the @xmath1 quasars .",
    "ukirt - uist has recently showed its capability in detecting quasar broad - emission lines in the highest redshift quasar known to date ( willott , mclure , & jarvis 2003 ) allowing an estimate of the black - hole mass in this quasar via the broad mgii emission line .",
    "lyman-@xmath20 is more than twice as bright as mgii in the composite sdss quasar spectrum and the huge drop blueward of lyman-@xmath20 due to absorption by neutral hydrogen is also a very strong signature .",
    "therefore , identification would be relatively easy in @xmath21  min exposures on the hobby - eberly telescope with its planned j - band extension to its low - resolution spectrograph and a huge amount of follow - up time will * not * be required .",
    "a survey of near - ir - selected , typically radio - quiet , @xmath1 quasars is to be pursued by the ukidss consortium using the ukirt ( warren 2002 ) .",
    "they expect to find @xmath22 examples from @xmath23 .",
    "we expect to find a similar number , despite the fact that only @xmath22% of quasars are radio - loud , because we cover 3-times the area , and go significantly deeper in the near - ir .",
    "because radio selection is unbiased by dust , spectroscopy / near - ir colours of our objects will help assess the effects of dust obscuration on the ukidss selection function . at such early epochs , little",
    "is currently known about the dust content of quasars and the consequent effect on their near - ir colours .",
    "we have outlined an efficient method to find radio - loud quasars within the epoch of reionization .",
    "when discovered these objects will allow us to probe intervening proto - galaxies and mini - haloes via absorption due to the hyperfine transition of hydrogen at 21  cm .",
    "this will provide crucial information regarding the build - up of the first galaxies as well as the quasar phenomena .",
