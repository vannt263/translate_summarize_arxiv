    "much of the evidence for this suggestion comes from often very good quality fitting of the @xmath0-functions to simulated or observed data combined with the appeal of the idea that the @xmath0-functions are the maximum distributions an appropriate entropy of presumably very broad applicability .",
    "this view point suggests that when dealing with systems that takes us beyond the realm of boltzmann - gibbs , the @xmath0-functions should be the generic distribution functions .",
    "accordingly we would expect @xmath0-functions describe the system whenever the choice of systems parameters leads to non - boltzmann - gibbs behavior .",

    "in order to understand better to which extend this attractive picture apply in reality , two of the authors together with c. tsallis investigated a little while ago a one - dimensional restricted random walk ( rrw ) model @xcite .",

    "we present firstly the analytic solution to the master equation for the rrw model and investigate the first return distribution .",
