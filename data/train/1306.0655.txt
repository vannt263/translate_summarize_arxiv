    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "meanwhile , the selected values of @xmath164 correspond to the cases with low , moderate , high and superhigh accretion rates .",
    "these solutions can be obtained by numerically solve the fundamental equations ( [ continuity ] ) , ( [ energy ] ) , ( [ radial - momentum ] ) , ( [ angular - momentum ] ) , ( [ vertical - eq ] ) , and ( [ bridging - formula ] ) with the numerical method described in section [ sec_num_meth ] .      in figure [ fig_struc ] , we show the structures of the sixteen solutions for comparing them with each other .",
    "there are six panels and they correspond with the profiles of density @xmath18 , temperature @xmath145 , radial velocity @xmath20 , electron degeneracy @xmath57 , optical depth of electron neutrino @xmath168 , and electron fraction @xmath169 .",
    "they reveal different spans of variation that @xmath18 increases by about @xmath170 orders of magnitude , @xmath145 increases by about @xmath171 orders of magnitude , and @xmath168 increases by about @xmath172 orders of magnitude from the outer to inner region , and , in the innermost region , @xmath18 reaches @xmath173 , @xmath145 reaches @xmath174 , and @xmath168 reaches @xmath175 , which are extremely dense , hot and neutrino - optically thick ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the difference between the effects of the accretion rate and the black hole spin is obvious .",
    "one can find that the profiles can be collected to four groups with the same color ( the same accretion rate ) .",
    "it implies the effect of accretion rate is global .",
    "meanwhile , the profiles with different line - styles ( different black hole spins ) in a colored group become more and more dispersive from outer to inner .",
    "it implies that the effect of black hole spin becomes remarkable only in the locations close to the black hole .",
    "there is a remarkable feature in the profiles of the radial velocity .",
    "they all tend to the light speed @xmath129 in the inner region and the radii satisfied @xmath176 ( the locations of the black hole horizon ) only determined by the black hole spin .",
    "it proofs that our model and the calculations are all consistent with the general relativity .",
    "the electron degeneracy is an important physical parameter that affects electron fraction , degeneracy pressure , and neutrino cooling @xcite .",
    "the profiles of @xmath57 , which represents the degree of electron degeneracy , in figure [ fig_struc ] is similar with the ones of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , there is a little difference between the profiles of @xmath169 in figure [ fig_struc ] and the previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our @xmath169 s can become larger than @xmath8 but can not in those previous works because of the different description of nse we used .",
    "our @xmath169 s all tend to @xmath177 at the outer boundary of the disk , which have a little different value @xmath178 in @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig_press ] , we show the contributions to the total pressure @xmath25 from the gas pressure of nucleons @xmath110 , radiation pressure of photons @xmath111 , degeneracy pressure of electrons @xmath112 and radiation pressure of neutrinos @xmath179 respectively .",
    "similar to the seeing in figure [ fig_struc ] , the effect of black hole spin is revealed by the dispersion of the profiles with different line - styles in a colored group .",
    "the more dispersion implies the more remarkable effects .",
    "one can see that the effects of black hole spins is still constrained in the inner region as seeing in figure [ fig_struc ] .",
    "however , a little detail revealed from figure [ fig_press ] should be mentioned here .",
    "the effects of black hole spins on the solutions with moderate ( @xmath180 ) and high ( @xmath181 ) accretion rates are more remarkable ( more dispersive ) than the solutions with low ( @xmath182 ) and superhigh ( @xmath183 ) accretion rates .",
    "the reasons are that the cooling of neutrino radiation in low accretion case is too weak to be sensitive to black hole spins only except for the solution with extremely spinning black hole , whereas the effect of black hole spin is damped by the superhigh accretion rate so that it is also insensitive to black hole spins in the case with superhigh accretion rate .",
    "focus on the profiles of @xmath184 and @xmath185 in figure [ fig_press ] , one can see that the contributions of @xmath110 exceed @xmath112 in some certain radii .",
    "the exceeding points only exist for the cases with high or extreme black hole spins in the solutions with low and moderate accretion rates , while they always exist in the solutions with high and superhigh accretion rates and their locations shift outwards for larger accretion rates .",
    "these are also due to the competitive relationship between the effects of the black hole spin and accretion rate on the neutrino cooling .    for the contributions of radiation pressure of neutrinos @xmath179",
    ", one can see that they are fully ignorable in outer region , which is always neutrino - optically thin , while they become notable and even exceed the photon radiation pressure in the inner region , which is neutrino - optically thick .    in figure [ fig_coolings",
    "] , we show the cooling rates normalized by the viscous heating rate @xmath186 .",
    "the photon coolings in our solutions are always much lower than the other coolings , so we ignore it in this figure .",
    "the profiles of our @xmath187 s are very similar to the ones in @xcite .",
    "@xmath188 in the outer region implies that the flow is advection dominated .",
    "the photodisintegration cooling causes the decrease of @xmath187 s even become negative in outer and middle regions .",
    "the neutrino cooling make @xmath187 s decrease to negative again in inner region .",
    "all of these behaviors are consistent with the relevant results of previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a special behavior of @xmath187 s and @xmath189 s that their values rapidly increase to much larger than unity near the inner edge of disks is due to the rapidly decrease of viscous heating @xmath186 in the fast inflowing flows .",
    "since we have considered the detailed nucleosynthesis in our model , we can obtain and trace the radial variation of more than 40 nucleons with our calculation . figure [ fig_nucleons ]",
    "shows the radial distributions of the mass fractions of seven major nucleons @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath3 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath4 and @xmath194 , which cover almost @xmath195 mass of flow .",
    "the mass fraction of @xmath4 dominates in the outer region for all the accretion rate . in the middle region",
    ", @xmath196 is dominant for all the accretion rate .",
    "free neutrons and protons are dominant via photodisintegration in the inner region with the hot and dense state .",
    "the size of the region dominated by free nucleons is determined by the accretion rate .",
    "the spin of black hole is also affected on the proportion of free protons and neutrons in the inner region .",
    "most of the free protons turn into the free neutrons due to the urca process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which causes the dominant free neutrons and the decrease of electron fraction .",
    "comparing with @xcite and @xcite , the more heavy nuclei appeared in the outer region of the disk , the more possible structure and component distribution have been described .",
    "it is an implication for the origin of heavy nuclei in grbs accounting for the detection of fe k@xmath26 x - ray lines and other emission lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can play an important role in understanding the nature of grbs , especially its central engine . the neutron - rich nse has been used in @xcite ( unfortunately , they did not show the distribution of heavy nuclei in the outer disk ) , in which electron fraction @xmath169 has been limited less than @xmath8 .",
    "the reasonable nse , we chose , is required that the range for @xmath169 is @xmath197 $ ] , which can certify the solutions naturally and reasonably . comparing with @xcite , kinds and distribution of elements are not different in the radial and vertical coordinates .",
    "@xmath106 dominates at the disk surface for lower accretion rate ( e.g. , @xmath198 @xmath1 ) , and @xmath4 dominates for larger accretion rate ( e.g. , @xmath199 @xmath1 ) , corresponding to @xmath169 around 0.49 and 0.47 , respectively .",
    "in addition , according to equation ( 29 ) , the profiles of @xmath169 in figure [ fig_struc ] can be indicated by figure [ fig_nucleons ] if we considered that the mass fraction approximately equals the number density .      in this paper , we concern the energetic estimation for boosting grb through the neutrino annihilation outside ndaf .",
    "therefore , we only concern the total annihilation luminosity but not the exact distribution of the annihilation energy and we calculate the neutrino trapping radius and the annihilation luminosity without taking account of the general relativistic effects on the neutrino trajectory to avoid the complexity in this calculation . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we list out the neutrino radiation luminosity @xmath200 , neutrino annihilation luminosity @xmath201 , efficiency of energy deposition @xmath202 , neutrino trapping radius @xmath123 , and the radius of marginally stable orbit @xmath124 of our sixteen solutions .",
    "the upper limit of neutrino luminosity reaches about @xmath203 , which is near the limit of the power of the kerr black hole , for the solution with @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "we notice that most of results about neutrino annihilation luminosity are higher than @xmath206 and thus are likely to be adequate for grbs",
    "@xcite even taking into account the effect of neutrino trapping , especially for the high accretion rate and rapidly spinning black hole .    comparing with the work of @xcite",
    ", @xmath201 is much smaller than theirs for the solutions with superhigh accretion rate ( @xmath183 ) since we consider the effects of neutrino trapping .",
    "in particular , they had @xmath207 for @xmath208 , @xmath183 , and @xmath209 for @xmath210 , @xmath183 , while we obtain more reasonable values @xmath211 , and @xmath212 , respectively .",
    "this implies that the influence of neutrino trapping can not be ignored especially for the superhigh accretion cases .",
    "@xcite fully considered the general relativistic effects on the neutrino trajectory in their annihilation calculation .",
    "they compared their results with @xcite .",
    "they stated that @xmath201 would be overestimated 10 times by the calculation without taking account general relativistic effects .",
    "thus , taking a conservative estimation , the 10 times lower @xmath201 listed in table [ tab1 ] can be regarded as reasonable approximated values . based on the results in table [ tab1 ] , we approximate the neutrino radiation luminosity , annihilation luminosity and neutrino trapping radius with three analytic formulae as functions of black hole spin and accretion rate , l_(erg  s^-1 ) & & 52.5 + 1.17a_*+1.17 , [ fit_lnu ] l_|(erg  s^-1 ) & & 49.5 + 2.45a_*+2.17 , [ fit_lnunu ] r_tr / r_g & & -0.92 + 2.42a_*+5.95 , [ fit_rtr ] where the negative value of @xmath123 predicted by equation ( 49 ) means there no trapping in the whole disk .",
    "in this paper , we calculated one - dimensional global solutions of ndafs , taking into account strict kerr metric , particular neutrino physics and precise nucleosynthesis processes , and discussed the structure and luminosity of ndafs .",
    "we find that the gas pressure of nucleons and neutrino cooling dominate in the inner region of the disk for large accretion rate , @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "the electron degeneracy has significant effects in ndafs and the electron fraction is about @xmath2 in the outer region . from the perspective of the mass fraction , free nucleons , @xmath3 , and @xmath4",
    "dominate in the inner , middle , and outer region , respectively .",
    "the influence of neutrino trapping on the annihilation is of importance for the superhigh accretion ( @xmath5 ) and most of the sixteen solutions have an adequate annihilation luminosity for grbs .",
    "the inner region of ndafs may be dynamically unstable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "time - dependent ndafs should be calculated replacing the steady solutions to verify the instability of the disk .",
    "time - dependent accretion disks around kerr black holes has been investigated in @xcite , which can be as the basis for the study of time - dependent ndaf model .",
    "jet emission is an essential qualification of grb events .",
    "some jet emission mechanisms have been discussed in literatures .",
    "basing the magnetic extraction of the rotational energy of a spinning black hole @xcite , @xcite and @xcite estimated the bz - luminosity from ndafs to budget the energy for jets and relevant grbs .",
    "recently , @xcite presented an alternative magnetohydrodynamic mechanism for the emission of episodic jets , which also can be used to power grbs . without magnetic field ,",
    "pair creation by neutrino annihilation outside ndafs @xcite , in fact , also has ability for the jet emission and it may possess an additional virtue on low baryonic contamination at the jet ejection point .",
    "our work in this paper belongs to the type of pair creation but we do not exploit this problem deeply due to avoiding the unnecessary complexity in the calculation of neutrino annihilation .",
    "thus , a further work of us is to fully relativistically calculate the neutrino annihilation and the neutrino trapping radius , and obtain the the spacial distribution of energy deposition for our disk model like the works of @xcite ( also see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even , it may be also attractive if we can combine the pair creation with the other magnetic mechanisms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which seem not conflict with each other .",
