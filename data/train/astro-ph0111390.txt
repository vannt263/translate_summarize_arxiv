    "measuring the comoving space density of the star formation rate ( sfr ) as a function of cosmic epoch has advanced rapidly over the last few years , it has set important constraints on our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution . since the major work of madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) data at @xmath14 @xcite and the lyman - break galaxy population at @xmath15 @xcite , many observational studies and detailed models have emerged to trace back the sfr history .",
    "the sfr density is usually derived from the mean luminosity density , that is @xmath16 , assuming galaxies follow a schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function with a characteristic luminosity , @xmath17 , a faint - end slope , @xmath0 , and a normalization density parameter , @xmath18 .",
    "the faint - end slope is found to be greater than @xmath19 , implying a high - space density of low - luminosity galaxies , but although they are very numerous , they contribute little to the mean luminosity density .",
    "however as the three schechter parameters are highly correlated , it is necessary to build the luminosity function over the largest possible range of luminosities . at first sight",
    "the sfr density appears a simple and useful tool to trace back the evolution of star formation and link it with the evolution of mass , but discrepancies between different measurements have led to controversy .",
    "uncertainties in the conversion factors from luminosity to star formation rate , coupled with the different survey selection criteria mean that the sfr history of the universe is still poorly determined , and thus hotly debated .",
    "the discrepancies are partly due to the difficulty in relating what we observe to the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of galaxies .",
    "each sfr indicator has pros and cons in the sense that they are more or less dependent on the star formation , and more or less affected by factors other than star formation .",
    "another difficulty is the small number of galaxies in some samples ; this leads to large statistical uncertainties , because they do not represent a fair sample of the galaxy population as a whole .",
    "large and deep galaxy surveys provide estimates of the continuum luminosity density in different rest - frame wavelength ranges from the far ultraviolet to the far infrared . as well as",
    "continuum luminosity density measurements , sfr indicators using line - emission measurements have also been studied , further complicating the picture but stimulating work for a better understanding of the physical star formation processes within galaxies .",
    "observationally speaking , it is generally accepted that the sfr density rises from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , but at higher redshifts it is still unclear whether the sfr density reaches a plateau , or decreases , or increases slowly .",
    "there has also been some controversy about the rise at @xmath14 ; lilly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found a steep rise of the 2800-  luminosity density proportional to @xmath22 , while cowie , songaila & barger ( 1999 ) argue for a shallow rise of the 2500-  luminosity density proportional to @xmath23 .    in this present study",
    ", we investigate the h@xmath0  @xmath16563 luminosity density evolution using data acquired at the eso - vlt with the isaac infrared spectro - imager ( cuby et al .",
    "2000 , moorwood et al .",
    "1999 ) mounted at the nasmyth focus of the first of the four 8.2 m vlt unit telescopes .",
    "we recall that h@xmath0 luminosities are excellent tracers of instantaneous star formation within galaxies since they are directly proportional to the ionizing uv stellar spectra at @xmath24   .",
    "it suffers from stellar absorption and dust attenuation , but dust affects h@xmath0 at a lower level than the uv , and can be mitigated by reddening correction .",
    "moreover new models ( see e.g. charlot & longhetti 2001 ) derive sfr estimates in a self - consistent way accounting for the depletion of heavy elements onto dust grains , for the absorption of ionizing photons by dust in regions , and for contamination of balmer emission by stellar absorption . with these corrections and with the help of several spectral lines , the sfr from h@xmath0 becomes compatible with the sfr using far - infrared estimators @xcite .",
    "furthermore , h@xmath0 is a particularly useful sfr indicator at high redshift since it is directly comparable to low redshift surveys , which makes it straightforward to probe evolution .",
    "we concentrate on h@xmath0 measurements of cfrs galaxies between @xmath25 using the data from tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) at @xmath26 , and new h@xmath0 data at @xmath27 taken with the isaac spectrograph .",
    "these data allow us to quantify for the first time the h@xmath0 luminosity function and density evolution up to @xmath21 within a single survey .",
    "in section  2 we present our data samples .",
    "section  3 details the isaac spectroscopic acquisition , reduction and flux measurements .",
    "section  4 discusses the reddening correction on our measurements .",
    "section  5 presents the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio and other properties of the samples .",
    "we estimate the sfr density for our samples in section  6 , and conclude with a discussion of our results in section  7 . throughout this paper , we use @xmath8  km  s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and @xmath10 mainly for ease of comparison with published results .",
    "our sample of galaxies is taken from the @xmath12-band - selected cfrs , of which 591 galaxies have reliable redshifts @xmath28 and apparent magnitudes @xmath29 , in five regions of the sky ( see le fvre et al .",
    "as described below , our sample is made of the low-@xmath30 sample of h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath26 observed in the five cfrs fields and of the high-@xmath30 sample of h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath31 observed in three cfrs fields .",
    "this offers the opportunity of direct measurements of evolution within a single survey with a well - controlled selection .",
    "moreover this study does not suffer from uncertainties in line identification as encounted by narrow - band filter surveys .",
    "the cfrs spectral range is 45008500   , thus the [ ] @xmath13727 line is observable for all galaxies with @xmath32 , and the h@xmath0 line is observable only for galaxies at @xmath33 .",
    "our low-@xmath30 sample consists of 110 out of the 138 cfrs galaxies to @xmath34 .",
    "they have h@xmath0-emission fluxes measured from the original cfrs spectra .",
    "this sample was analysed by tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) , who describe the sample in more detail . with new near infrared capabilities we can now measure h@xmath0 at higher redshifts , and we have focused on cfrs galaxies at @xmath35 . for our new observations",
    ", we used the isaac spectrograph in the short - wavelength mode ; this configuration enables us to span the wavelength range 0.92.5  @xmath36 m .",
    "the @xmath37- and @xmath38-band filters with an atmospheric transmission above 0.5 cover the wavelength range 0.981.35  @xmath36 m",
    ". thus h@xmath0 will be in this range for galaxies within the redshift interval 0.501.05 .",
    "the cfrs contains 323 galaxies in this interval .    for our high-@xmath30 sample",
    ", we selected our targets using the following two well - defined criteria chosen so that we could measure h@xmath0-emission fluxes as accurately as possible .",
    "the first criterion was aimed at maximizing the probability of detecting h@xmath0 in emission . in nearby samples , the [ ] and",
    "h@xmath0 emission lines are correlated , even though there is a large dispersion ( see e.g. kennicutt 1992 , tresse et al .",
    "thus we selected galaxies where the cfrs spectra show [ ] emission with observed equivalent width ew@xmath39   .",
    "there are 251 targets out of 323 with ew ( [ ] ) @xmath39   .",
    "the second criterion was to select galaxies with h@xmath0 redshifted away from strong oh night - sky emission lines .",
    "for each of the ew ( [ ] ) @xmath40    targets we cross - correlated the expected redshifted wavelength of h@xmath0 with a list of oh - sky lines , and rejected galaxies where h@xmath0 would be too close to a sky line . for the galaxy line - widths we assumed fwhm(h@xmath0 )",
    "@xmath41   , corresponding to a rotation speed of 600  km  s@xmath9 , and for the oh - sky lines we assumed fwhm  @xmath42   , corresponding to the instrumental resolution for our observing set - up .",
    "these fwhm are large enough so we could be fairly confident that the observed h@xmath0 will be in between the oh bands , even with the uncertainty from the redshift measurement .",
    "rejecting the galaxies at redshifts where h@xmath0 is likely to be affected by a sky line , leaves 84 targets .",
    "our spectroscopic observations were done in service mode during period-63 and period-64 with the isaac spectrograph at the eso - vlt .",
    "spectra were taken at medium resolution , and with the short - wavelength channel equipped with a 1024@xmath431024 hawaii rockwell array .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.147 arcsec per pixel .",
    "we opted for long slits of 2 arcsec width , ensuring that most of the light of the target was in the slit ( see the 5x5 arcsec@xmath44 postage stamps from hst data shown in fig .  1 of schade et al .",
    "this set - up gives a resolution of @xmath45 , and covers a wavelength range of 0.16  @xmath36 m in the @xmath37 filter , and 0.29  @xmath36 m in the @xmath38 filter .",
    "we chose six central wavelengths which are away from the strongest oh bands and cover the wavelength range for the expected positions of h@xmath0 for all the target galaxies .",
    "the central wavelengths are 1.02 and 1.06  @xmath36 m for the @xmath37 filter , 1.11 , 1.18 , 1.26 and 1.33  @xmath36 m for the @xmath38 filter . for each observation ,",
    "the appropriate central wavelength was selected according to the redshift of the target .",
    "since the observations were carried out in service mode , the choice of integration time had to be made before - hand .",
    "we set them by comparing to the commissioning data which were available at that time , and adjusting the time for each galaxy according to its [ ] flux and the spectral type .",
    "thus the individual integration times ( called dit ) were set to be either 600s , 900s or 1200s . during the observations",
    "the telescope was nodded between a and b positions , 20 arcsec apart along the slit .",
    "the total integration time was 2@xmath43dit , consisting of one sequence  ab .",
    "dark frames , flat - fields and ( xe+ar ) arc lamp spectra were taken with the same filter , central wavelength and slit width for each of the targets observed during the night . in total , 33 observation blocks ( ob ) were observed .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the target name , the exposure time and the filter used for each ob .",
    "we used the iraf / cl package for our data reduction .",
    "we first subtracted the dark image from the a , b and flat images .",
    "next we divided the a and b images by the flat response .",
    "the resulting a and b images were then subtracted from each other to form ( a@xmath46b ) and ( b@xmath46a ) images . at this stage ,",
    "the images have been corrected for the dark current , bias level and flat - field , and have been sky subtracted . to combine a and b data",
    ", we first apply a spatial offset to the ( b@xmath46a ) image , equal to the nod between the a and b positions so that the galaxy signal appears at the same position in each image",
    ". then we average the ( a@xmath46b ) image and the offset ( b@xmath46a ) image after rejecting 3@xmath47 discrepant pixels .",
    "this procedure removes most cosmic rays , sky residuals and bad pixels .",
    "then a 1d spectrum was extracted at the position of the emission line , and calibrated in wavelength using the arc lines .",
    "finally the 1d spectra were spectrophotometrically calibrated with a standard star observed with the same setup as the target . for most galaxies",
    "the standard star observations were taken during the same night . for 2 galaxies , standard stars from neighbouring nights were used . at the time of our observations , carefully flux calibrated standard star spectra covering the near infrared bands did not exist , and the only information we had for the standard stars was the spectral type and the magnitude in several pass bands . therefore to determine the spectral response function we compared the observed stellar spectra to spectra from the pickles ( 1998 ) stellar library of composite spectra . as a check on the reliability of the pickles flux calibration , we compared the spectra to the broad - band magnitudes .",
    "we found that the agreement between the spectral shape and the ubvrijhk magnitudes is excellent as shown for an example in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "[ tab1 ]     +     +     +     +     +     +     +     +      we measured the integrated fluxes and the corresponding 1@xmath47 errors using the package splot under iraf / cl , interactively marking two endpoints around the line to be measured .",
    "this method allows the accurate measurement of lines which are not well fit by simple gaussian profiles , including lines with asymmetric shapes . out of 33 observation blocks",
    ", we obtained 30 h@xmath0 flux measurements .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and the fluxes are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we detect no emission line in the remaining 3 observations ; for these either h@xmath0 is below our detection limit , or it falls on an oh line due to a large error in the redshift measurement .",
    "discrepancies between the redshifts measured from the original cfrs spectra and from ours are less than 0.003 , except for two cases ( 0.0095 and 0.0082 respectively for # 03.0984 and # 22.0779 , see fig",
    ".  [ fig3 ] ) for which the cfrs calibration appears less accurate . excluding these cases",
    ", the @xmath48 discrepancy is 0.0014 , i.e. 420  km  s@xmath9 , consistent with the redshift accuracy of 350550  km  s@xmath9 estimated in le fvre et al .",
    "the high - resolution of our spectra means that h@xmath0 is well separated from the [ ] @xmath496548 , 6583 lines which are detected in several spectra .",
    "since the slit is 2 arcsec wide , it covers most of the apparent size of galaxies at @xmath50 ( see the 5x5 arcsec@xmath44 postage stamps from hst data shown in fig .  1 of schade et al .",
    "thus we did not apply any aperture correction to our measurements .",
    "line luminosities are given in erg s@xmath9 by , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the integrated line flux in erg s@xmath9 @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the luminosity distance in mpc .",
    "in the case of h@xmath0 , the line fluxes vary from 5 to 82  10@xmath55 erg s@xmath9 @xmath53 , with an average flux of 22  10@xmath55 erg s@xmath9 @xmath53 .",
    "reddening is produced by interstellar extinction along the line of sight to each observed galaxy .",
    "interstellar extinction due to our galaxy is small ( a@xmath56 0.1 mag ) , because the cfrs fields are located at high galactic latitude ( @xmath57 @xmath58 45@xmath59 ) ; hence most of the reddening is intrinsic to the observed galaxy . for about two thirds of the galaxies ,",
    "the h@xmath60 lines observed in the cfrs spectra have too low signal - to - noise to be accurately measured , so we can not estimate a@xmath61 for every galaxy .",
    "thus we present our results using two approaches : ( a ) with no correction for reddening , ( b ) with a reddening correction derived from two observed balmer lines , and if not observed assuming an average correction a@xmath61 of 1 mag as found in several nearby samples ( e.g. for instance kennicutt 1992 , tresse & maddox 1998 ) .",
    "note that in all of these cases the estimates refer only to reddening that occurs after the emission of the balmer photons , and they do not account for any obscuration of lyman continuum photons before this .",
    "charlot et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest that the absorption of lyman continuum may introduce a further attenuation of @xmath62% .    for @xmath50 galaxies we assume a@xmath63 1 mag ( @xmath64 ; seaton 1979 ) , which corresponds to an extinction correction of @xmath65 .",
    "hence fluxes are dereddened as @xmath52(h@xmath0)10@xmath66 , and @xmath52([])10@xmath67 using the galactic extinction law from seaton  ( 1979 ) .",
    "we note that hammer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimated the @xmath68h@xmath69h@xmath70 ratio using high - resolution spectra of two of our @xmath50 targets ; the ratios are 2.18 for # 03.0570 and 2.98 for # 03.1349 .",
    "these ratios correspond to a@xmath61 of 0.15 and 2.44 mag respectively , or @xmath71 and 1.12 respectively , derived using @xmath72(h@xmath73/h@xmath60 )  =  0.468 for case b recombination with a density of 100 @xmath74 and a temperature of 10,000 k ( osterbrock 1989 ) , and applying seaton s law , @xmath52(h@xmath73/h@xmath60 )  =  @xmath72(h@xmath73/h@xmath60)10@xmath75 .",
    "these two galaxies are plotted as starred symbols in the figures . for the @xmath76 galaxies ,",
    "as described in tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) , for half of the sample , we derived @xmath77 using measured @xmath52(h@xmath0)/@xmath52(h@xmath60 ) ratios and the same prescription as earlier with @xmath52(h@xmath0/h@xmath60 )  =  @xmath72(h@xmath0/h@xmath60)10@xmath78 , ( @xmath72(h@xmath0/h@xmath60 )  =  2.86 ; osterbrock 1989 ) . for the remaining half we used a@xmath61",
    "=  1 mag .",
    "although we use an average reddening correction , the true a@xmath61 varies significantly from galaxy to galaxy . for instance , in our cfrs low-@xmath30 spectra where the h@xmath60 lines have sufficient signal - to - noise , we find values ranging from about 0 to 2 mag as shown in fig .",
    "variations in stellar absorption introduce some scatter in apparent reddening , but most of the scatter represents genuine differences in reddening .",
    "ideally h@xmath0 and h@xmath60 should be corrected for stellar absorption , but this is not possible with the cfrs spectra . for galaxies without high signal - to - noise spectra covering both h@xmath0 and h@xmath60 we can do no better than assume a constant a@xmath79 1 mag as found in several nearby samples .",
    "this applies to all , except two , of our high-@xmath30 galaxies , and half of our low-@xmath30 sample .",
    "although not ideal , this simple approximation should be correct on average , and allows us to examine some of the effects of reddening on our results .",
    "we note that fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that our measured a@xmath61 increases towards high h@xmath0 luminosities , and thus towards bright @xmath80-band luminosities ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "@xmath11-selected galaxy samples show a similar trend ( sullivan et al .",
    "2001 ) , as do samples using fir data ( for instance e.g. wang & heckman 1996 , hopkins et al .",
    "thus it is possible that our high-@xmath30 h@xmath0 sample would require a correction larger than 1 mag .",
    "the fact that high-@xmath30 cfrs galaxies exhibit more irregular / starbursting morphologies ( brinchmann et al .",
    "1998 ) may also argue for a larger correction .",
    "however comparison of our h@xmath0 results with our 2800-  data ( section 6.4 ) suggests that the average reddening correction can not be much larger .",
    "this strengthens our 1  mag assumption for @xmath12-band selected cfrs sample .",
    "we note also that h@xmath0 attenuations based on radio data are larger by @xmath81 mag on average than using balmer decrements ( see e.g. bell & kennicutt 2001 , caplan & deharveng 1986 ) .",
    "all of these uncertainties in reddening correction are small compared to the statistical uncertainty in our final luminosity density estimate .",
    "the cfrs @xmath12-band selection implies that intrinsically bright galaxies , ( m@xmath821 ) , are targeted at high redshift , i.e. with  @xmath83 mag at @xmath50 .",

    "this could simply be due to the lower sampling rate in the observed high-@xmath30 sample , but also the higher ew detection limit for the high-@xmath30 sample ( see section 5.1 ) biases against detecting galaxies with a red continuum and a weak h@xmath0 flux .      in other surveys where h@xmath0 could not be observed , the [ ] line has frequently been used to provide sfr estimates by making the assumption that the [ ] h@xmath0 ratio is constant and equal to that derived from local samples .",
    "these two lines are closely related since they both come from star formation activity in regions . however , [ ] depends also on the metal fraction present in the gas , and on the ionization parameter , which means that the observed scatter about the mean relation is large .",
    "for instance in the sapm sample ( tresse et al . 1999 ) and the kennicutt ( 1992 ) data , the scatter in the ew ratio is as large as 60 per cent .",

    "this allows direct comparison with sfrs derived from continuum luminosity densities where no such exclusion is done .",
    "also it avoids possible confusions from the fact that different criteria may be used to identify active galaxies in different samples . at @xmath119 ,",
    "the fraction of agn - like spectra can vary from few per cent to 40 per cent depending on the selection criteria .",
    "for example , it is 817 per cent in the cfrs low-@xmath30 sample ( tresse et al .",
    "1996 ) ; 8 per cent in the local ucm ( gallego et al . 1995 ) ; 1728 per cent in the 15r survey ( carter et al .",
    "detailed studies as for instance done by ho , filipenko & sargent ( 1997 ) find a fraction of 43 per cent in their blue - selected survey .",
    "@xmath11-selected samples contain almost no narrow - line agn ( contini et al . 2002 ) , this agrees with the common picture that active galaxies are more dusty than normal galaxies .",
    "if an active nucleus is present in the central region of a galaxy , then the h@xmath0 flux is not correlated directly to forming stars , but is a mixture from both the agn and sfr .",
    "this makes it difficult to separate the stellar from the agn contribution in the total luminosity density from optically - selected galaxy surveys .",
    "the sfr density diagrams derived from such surveys must depend on the fraction of agn - like galaxies , and on any global cosmic evolution in the nuclear activity of galaxies . in the ucm ,",
    "the 8 per cent of agn - like galaxies contribute to 15 per cent to the overall luminosity density ( pascual et al . 2001 ) .",
    "if this fraction stays about constant up to @xmath120 , then the h@xmath0-derived sfrs are contaminated by no more than 15 per cent agn light .",
    "this is an upper limit to the contamination , because excluding agn - like galaxies will exclude the light from present star formation as well as their agn contribution .      in fig .",

    "a shift in sfr density of a factor of 3.20 is necessary .",
    "this ratio corresponds to the dust correction to the near @xmath11 data , and implies @xmath127 mag for a simple dust - screen model ( pei 1992 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the l(2800)/l(h@xmath0 ) ratio of 3.1@xmath1280.4 10@xmath129 hz@xmath9 found by glazebrook et al .",

    "the charlot & longhetti ( 2001 ) model accounts for the absorption of ionizing photons by dust in regions and the contamination of h@xmath0 emission by stellar absorption . including these effects",
    "they find that sfr estimators derived from h@xmath0 , [ ] , @xmath11 , and far-@xmath134 fluxes give consistent results .",
    "this would imply that the cfrs-@xmath11 sfr densities should be increased by a factor 5 or 6 .",
    "our h@xmath0 luminosity density estimates confirm the steep rise in sfr density for @xmath135 , as found by lilly et al .",
    "since our results are based on independent h@xmath0 measurements , the steep rise is unlikely to be due to extrapolation of the cfrs data to the 2800-  luminosities as suggested by cowie et al .",
    "our measurements are inconsistent with the shallow rise of the 2500-   luminosity density , @xmath136 , found by cowie et al .",

    "this survey covers a very small area ( @xmath140 arcmin@xmath44 ) compared to the cfrs ( @xmath141 arcmin@xmath44 ) , and so must be subject to much larger uncertainties due do cosmic variance .",
    "thus we believe that the steeper rise in sfr is more likely to be correct .",
    "the exact slope of the rise also depends on which local value is taken .",

    "( 1998 ) finds a higher value using the h@xmath0 kiss survey .",

    "( 1999 ) , require strong evolution in the sfr density , which increases by a factor 12 from @xmath138 to @xmath145 .",
    "we have measured h@xmath0 in emission for 30 galaxies from the cfrs at @xmath146 using the isaac eso - vlt spectrograph .",
    "these data combined with those at @xmath26 ( tresse & maddox 1998 ) enabled us to derive measurements within a single survey with well - controled selection criteria , and with secure redshift measurements . our results are the following :    1 .   h@xmath0 and @xmath80-band luminosities are tightly correlated at high-@xmath30 as seen at low-@xmath30 by tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) .",
    "this strengthens the hypothesis of an universal imf .",
    "we demonstrate that the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio is luminosity dependent .",
    "bright galaxies have ratios larger by a factor  2 than faint galaxies .",
