    "quantum dot devices provide a well - controlled object for studying quantum many - body physics . in many respects ,",
    "such a device resembles an atom imbedded into a fermi sea of itinerant electrons .",
    "these electrons are provided by the leads attached to the dot .",
    "the orbital mixing in the case of quantum dot corresponds to the electron tunneling through the junctions connecting the dot with leads .",
    "voltage @xmath0 applied to a gate ",
    "an electrode coupled to the dot capacitively  allows one to control the number of electrons @xmath1 on the dot . almost at any gate voltage",
    "an electron must have a finite energy in order to overcome the on - dot coulomb repulsion and tunnel into the dot .",
    "therefore , the conductance of the device is suppressed at low temperatures ( coulomb blockade phenomenon@xcite ) .",
    "the exceptions are the points of charge degeneracy . at these points , two charge states of the dot",
    "have the same energy , and an electron can hop on and off the dot without paying an energy penalty .",
    "this results in a periodic peak structure in the dependence of the conductance @xmath2 on @xmath0 .",
    "away from the peaks , in the coulomb blockade valleys , the charge fluctuations are negligible , and the number of electrons @xmath1 is integer .    every time @xmath1 is tuned to an odd integer , the dot must carry a half - integer spin . in the simplest case ,",
    "the spin is @xmath3 , and is due to a single electron residing on the last occupied discrete level of the dot .",
    "thus , the quantum dot behaves as @xmath3 magnetic impurity imbedded into a tunneling barrier between two massive conductors .",
    "it is known@xcite since mid-60 s that the presence of such impurities leads to zero - bias anomalies in tunneling conductance@xcite , which are adequately explained@xcite in the context of the kondo effect@xcite .",
    "the advantage of the new experiments@xcite is in full control over the `` magnetic impurity '' responsible for the effect .",
    "for example , by varying the gate voltage , @xmath1 can be changed .",
    "kondo effect results in the increased low temperature conductance only in the odd-@xmath1 valleys .",
    "the even-@xmath1 valleys nominally correspond to the @xmath4 spin state ( non - magnetic impurity ) , and the conductance decreases with lowering the temperature .",
    "however , the enhancement of the low temperature conductance in the even-@xmath1 valleys has been observed recently in both vertical @xcite and lateral @xcite gaas quantum dots , and in transport through carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "unlike the real atoms , the energy separation between the discrete states in a quantum dot is fairly small .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 state of a dot with even number of electrons is less robust than the corresponding ground state of a real atom . because of",
    "the exchange interactions between electrons residing on the last doubly occupied level , one of the electrons is promoted to the next ( empty ) orbital state , and thus a triplet spin state of the dot is formed .",
    "apparently , dots studied in @xcite and @xcite were in a triplet state in the absence of magnetic field . on the other hand , experiments with carbon nanotubes @xcite indicate that in the absence of magnetic field the state with even number of electrons is a singlet .",
    "application of a magnetic field results in a spin transition in the ground state of a quantum dot @xcite or carbon nanotube @xcite . in the former case",
    "the zeeman effect is negligible because of the small @xmath5-factor in gaas ; magnetic field affects mostly the orbital states , making energy of the triplet state higher than that of the singlet . in the latter case , the zeeman contribution dominates and can exceed the level spacing , i.e. , the magnetic field induces the transition to a triplet state .",
    "electron tunneling between the dot and leads results in mixing of the components of the ground state .",
    "the mixing involves spin as well as orbital degrees of freedom and yields an enhancement of the low temperature conductance through the dot at the transition point .",
    "this enhancement can be viewed as a _ magnetic field  induced kondo effect _ @xcite .    in section  [ model ]",
    "a simple model capable of describing the singlet - triplet transition in coulomb blockade systems is introduced . in section  [ sw ]",
    "we derive an effective low energy hamiltonian and establish the fermi - liquid nature of its ground state .",
    "the hamiltonian is analyzed by means of renormalization group in sections  [ scaling]-[zeeman ] .",
    "generalizations of the model are discussed in appendices  [ e&n]-[staircase ] .",
    "section  [ transition ] is relevant for the experiments @xcite with vertical gaas quantum dots . in this case",
    "the zeeman energy is very small due to an anomalously small electronic @xmath5-factor in gaas .",
    "the low energy physics in this limit is described by a special version of a two - impurity kondo model @xcite .",
    "we show that at zero temperature the linear dc conductance is a monotonous function of a magnetic field , reaching the unitary limit @xmath6 at the triplet side of the singlet - triplet transition , and decreasing logarithmically at the singlet side .",
    "the kondo temperature on the triplet side of the transition falls off rapidly from @xmath7 at the transition point down to @xmath8 far away from the transition @xcite .",
    "the relations between @xmath9 , and the kondo temperature @xmath10 in the adjacent coulomb blockade valleys depend on the tunneling amplitudes between the dot and the leads and also on the intradot interactions . if the tunneling preserves the orbital symmetry , as it likely occurs in vertical quantum dots @xcite , then @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , at a finite temperature @xmath12 the kondo effect in @xmath13 valley of coulomb blockade can be observed only when the system is tuned to the singlet - triplet transition point @xcite .",
    "if the tunneling mixes the orbitals , the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath10 becomes less pronounced and vanishes if the mixing is strong , see appendix  [ mixing ] .",
    "the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath10 is almost independent on the degree of mixing but depends strongly on the intradot interactions , see appendices  [ e&n],[mixing ] .    in section  [ zeeman ]",
    "we discuss the zeeman splitting ",
    "driven transition @xcite , relevant for the transport experiments with carbon nanotubes @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the @xmath5-factor is close to its free - electron value , while the orbital effects are suppressed due to a small radius of the nanotube .",
    "the low energy physics in this case is described adequately by the single - channel anisotropic kondo model .",
    "tuning away from the transition points is equivalent to applying a finite magnetic field to the conventional kondo impurity .",
    "the dc conductance has a peak at the transition point at all values of @xmath14 , with the corresponding kondo temperature being of the same order as @xmath10 .",
    "finally , in section  [ flip ] we demonstrate that in a generic case the positions of the peaks of _ non - linear _ conductance are not symmetric with respect to the change of the bias polarity .",
    "this effect is weak and can be best seen in double - dot systems .",
    "we will consider a confined electron system which does not have special symmetries , and therefore the single particle levels in it are non - degenerate .",
    "in addition , we assume the electron - electron interaction to be relatively weak ( the gas parameter @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore , discussing the ground state , we concentrate on the transitions which involve only the lowest - spin states . in the case of _ even _ number of electrons @xmath1 on the dot , these are states with @xmath4 and @xmath16 . at a sufficiently large level spacing @xmath17 between the last occupied ( @xmath18 ) and the first empty orbital level ( @xmath19 ) , the ground state is a singlet at @xmath20 .",
    "finite magnetic field affects the orbital energies ; if it reduces the difference between the energies of the said orbital levels , a transition to a state with @xmath16 may occur , as illustrated at fig .",
    "[ crossings ] .",
    "such a transition involves rearrangement of two electrons between the levels @xmath21 . out of the six states involved ,",
    "three belong to a triplet @xmath16 , and three others are singlets ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the degeneracy of the triplet states is removed only by zeeman energy .",
    "the three singlet states , in general , are not degenerate with each other . to describe qualitatively the transition between a singlet and the triplet in the ground state , it is sufficient to consider the following hamiltonian : @xmath22 here",
    ", @xmath23 is the total number of electrons occupying the levels @xmath21 , operator @xmath24 is the corresponding total spin of the dot ( @xmath25 are the pauli matrices ) , and the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the exchange , charging , and zeeman energies respectively @xcite .",
    "we restrict our attention to the very middle of a coulomb blockade valley with an even number of electrons in the dot ( that is modelled by setting the dimensionless gate voltage @xmath29 to @xmath30 ) .",
    "we assume that the level spacing @xmath31 is tunable , _",
    "e.g. _ , by means of a magnetic field @xmath32 : @xmath33 .    the lowest energy singlet state and the three components of the competing triplet state can be labeled as @xmath34 in terms of the total spin @xmath35 and its @xmath36-projection @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the state with the two levels empty . from ( [ hdot ] ) ,",
    "the energies of these states satisfy @xmath40 if , for example , @xmath41 at @xmath20 , the ground state of the dot in the absence of the magnetic field is a singlet @xmath42 .",
    "finite field shifts the singlet and triplet states due to the orbital effect , and also leads to zeeman splitting of the components of the triplet .",
    "as @xmath32 is varied , the level crossings occur ( see fig .",
    "[ crossings ] ) .",
    "the first such crossing takes place at @xmath43 , for which @xmath44 at this point the two states , @xmath45 and @xmath42 , form a doubly degenerate ground state of the dot .",
    "= 6.5 cm    if leads are attached to the dot , the dot - lead tunneling results in the hybridization of the degenerate ( singlet and triplet ) states .",
    "the characteristic energy scale @xmath7 associated with the hybridization can be in different relations with the zeeman splitting at field @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath46 , then the zeeman splitting can be neglected , and at the @xmath43 point all _ four _ states ( [ basis ] ) can be considered as degenerate .",
    "this limit adequately describes a quantum dot formed in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the gaas - algaas interface , subject to a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "indeed , the orbital effect of a magnetic field is very strong in gaas due to a smallness of the effective mass , so that a relatively weak magnetic field @xmath47 suffices to induce the spin transition .",
    "in addition , the electronic @xmath5-factor in gaas is also small .",
    "both these factors contribute to the smallness of the zeeman energy @xmath48 compared to @xmath7 .",
    "this case is studied in details in section  [ transition ] .",
    "the opposite limit @xmath49 is realized in carbon nanotubes @xcite . in nanotubes , on the one hand , the effect of magnetic field on orbital motion is very weak due to their small diameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath5-factor is close to its free electron value @xmath50 , yielding an appreciable zeeman splitting even in a magnetic field of moderate strength .",
    "this limit of the theory is addressed in section  [ zeeman ] .    in order to study the transport problem",
    ", we need to introduce into the model the hamiltonian of the leads and a term that describes the tunneling .",
    "we choose them in the following form : @xmath51 here @xmath52 for the right / left lead , and @xmath53 for the two orbitals participating in the singlet - triplet transition ; @xmath54 labels states of the continuum spectrum in the leads , and @xmath55 is the spin index .",
    "the single - particle energies @xmath56 include the direct effect of the external magnetic field on the electrons in the leads .    in writing ( [ leads])-([ht ] ) , we had in mind the vertical dot device @xcite , where the potential creating lateral confinement of electrons most probably does not vary much over the thickness of the dot @xcite .",
    "therefore we have assumed that the electron orbital motion perpendicular to the axis of the device can be characterized by the same quantum number @xmath57 inside the dot and in the leads .",
    "presence of two orbital channels @xmath21 is important for the explanation of experiments @xcite , in which the orbital effect of the magnetic field dominates . in the case of large zeeman splitting , the problem effectively becomes a single - channel one @xcite , as we will see in section  [ zeeman ] .",
    "we will demonstrate the derivation of the effective low energy hamiltonian under a simplifying assumption @xcite @xmath58 it has been shown previously @xcite that , despite its simplicity , eq .",
    "( [ tunneling ] ) still allows to understand , at least qualitatively , the most interesting results of the experiments @xcite . some of the features not captured by ( [ tunneling ] ) will be discussed later on .",
    "the advantage of ( [ tunneling ] ) is that it allows us to perform a rotation in the r - l space @xcite @xmath59 after which the @xmath60 field decouples from the dot : @xmath61 the hamiltonian of the system then acquires a form @xmath62 where @xmath63 with @xmath64 given by eq .",

    "we can now simplify @xmath72 by integrating out the virtual transitions to the states with @xmath87 electrons on the dot .",

    "( [ response ] ) , the linear conductance is determined by the scattering properties of the @xmath66-particles in the vicinity of the fermi level .",

    "thus , not quite unexpectedly @xcite , the direct zeeman coupling of the magnetic field to the electrons in the leads has little influence on the properties of the system .",
    "there were several simplifying assumptions involved in the derivation of the effective hamiltonian ( [ model])-([hn ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we believe it provides an adequate description of the low temperature physics in the vicinity of the singlet - triplet transition .",

    ", the dot behaves like a composite two - spin impurity .",
    "obviously , it takes only two channels to screen such an impurity . by analogy with the multichannel kondo model @xcite one should expect that in the absence of special symmetry no more than two channels are coupled to the dot in the effective low energy hamiltonian .    in the above derivation of the effective two - channel hamiltonian we entirely ignored the multilevel structure of the dot and",
    "also adopted a simplified description of intradot coulomb interaction .",
    "the presence of many energy levels in the dot is important at the energies above the single particle level spacing @xmath31 , while the kondo physics emerges at the energy scale well below @xmath31 .",
    "these levels result merely in a renormalization of the parameters of the effective low energy hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "one only needs to consider this renormalization for deriving the relation between the parameters @xmath102 of the low energy hamiltonian ( [ hdot ] ) , ( [ leads ] ) and ( [ ht ] ) to the `` bare '' constants of the model defined in a wide @xmath103 band . on the other hand , using the effective low energy hamiltonian",
    ", one can calculate , in principle , the observable quantities such as conductance @xmath104 and other susceptibilities of the system at low temperatures ( @xmath105 ) , and establish the relations between them , which is our main goal .",

    "( [ hn ] ) , all three models turn out to be identical as far as one is interested in the low - temperature properties of the system .",
    "we will see in the next section that the three constants , @xmath98 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 of the exchange hamiltonian ( [ hn ] ) grow in the course of renormalization . at a sufficiently advanced stage of the renormalization group procedure , these constants significantly exceed their starting values .",
    "it turns out , see appendices  [ e&n ] and [ mixing ] , that at such a stage the hamiltonians ( [ hn1 ] ) and ( [ enmodel ] ) generate the same renormalization group ( rg ) flow as eq .",
