    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) of early - type galaxies is the empirical relation between the effective radius @xmath9 , stellar velocity dispersion within one effective radius @xmath10 , and the average surface brightness within one effective radius @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "traditionally , the offset in the fp is interpreted as the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath6 ) evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , under the assumption that early - type galaxies form a homologous family , and that all the evolution is caused by the change in luminosity . @xcite",
    "indeed suggests that this assumption is correct , finding that out to @xmath12 the slope of the fp does not change . by extending @xmath6 evolutionary studies to higher redshifts ,",
    "it is possible to put constraints on the formation epoch of massive galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath6 has been studied extensively out to @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the general consensus is that the evolution of the @xmath6 appears to evolve as @xmath14 . with recent studies showing that the first massive , quiescent galaxies were already in place when the universe was only @xmath153 gyr old ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the question arises of whether the fp already existed at this early epoch and how the @xmath6 evolved .    with the advent of new nir spectrographs , such as vlt - x - shooter and keck - mosfire",
    ", it is now possible to obtain rest - frame optical spectra of quiescent galaxies out to @xmath0 .",
    "for example , in @xcite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) we obtained stellar kinematic measurements for five massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath16 ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) . combined with high - resolution imaging and multi - wavelength catalogs ,",
    "these recently acquired kinematic measurements enable the extension of fp studies beyond @xmath13 .    in this letter",
    ", we explore the existence of an fp at @xmath0 , and use the fp to measure the evolution of the @xmath6 from @xmath0 to the present day for massive quiescent galaxies . in a parallel study , @xcite presented the mass fp evolution . throughout the letter",

    "we use the @xcite stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models and assume an exponentially declining star formation history , the @xcite dust attenuation law , and the @xcite stellar initial mass function . for galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ,",
    "stellar masses are from the mpa - jhu dr7 release which are based on @xcite .",
    "the photometry and thus also the stellar mass are corrected for missing flux using the best - fit srsic luminosity @xcite .",
    "effective radii and other structural parameters , such as srsic index and axis ratio , are determined using two - dimensional srsic fits with galfit @xcite .",
    "the effective radii are circularized , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "all rest - frame fluxes , including those for the sdss sample , are calculated using the photometric redshift code eazy ( v46 ; @xcite ) .",

    "absolute @xmath40-band magnitudes are calculated with @xmath42 , which we derive from the solar spectrum taken from the calspec database .",
    "we adopt a mass limit ( @xmath43 ) to homogenize the final sample .",
    "we note , however , that our sample remains relatively heterogeneous and in particular the higher redshift samples are biased toward the brightest galaxies ( see also section [ sec : bias ] ) .",
    "we furthermore use the @xmath44 versus @xmath45 rest - frame color selection criterion to remove star - forming galaxies from our sample ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "quiescent galaxies are selected to have @xmath46 .",
    "this criteria is slightly different from previous work , as we do not require that @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "the latter criteria remove post - starburst galaxies and very old galaxies , respectively .",
    "the fp is traditionally written as : @xmath49 with @xmath50 in kpc , @xmath51 in kms@xmath21 , and @xmath52 in @xmath39 . in this letter",
    ", we adopt the slope from @xcite , i.e. , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . while detailed studies on galaxies in the sdss have shown that the slope is steeper , i.e. , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 @xcite , we nonetheless adopt the @xcite values , for an easier comparison with previous high - redshift studies .",
    "we do not fit the slope ourselves at high redshift , as our sample is too small and biased at @xmath5 .",
    "however , we note that @xcite find the same slope of the fp at @xmath12 as @xcite .",
    "while the projection of the fp along the effective radius is most often shown , the projection along @xmath57 directly shows the evolution in the @xmath6 , which is thought to be the main driver in the evolution of the fp zero point .",
    "the top row in figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the following projection : @xmath58 with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "we determine the zero point @xmath62 using a least - square fit , using the @xmath63 function @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the zero point evolves rapidly with redshift : @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the top row in figure [ fig : fig1 ] suggests that the fp exists out to @xmath0 .",
    "however , to quantify the existence of an fp , we consider the scatter before and after the fp fit , i.e. , the rms scatter in @xmath57 versus the scatter in @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "for example , for galaxies in the sdss for which we know the fp exists , the scatter in @xmath57 is @xmath68 dex before the fit , while after the fit , we measure @xmath69dex . at @xmath70",
    "we find a decrease as well , from @xmath71 dex , before the fit , to @xmath72 after the fit .",
    "this hints at the existence of an fp at @xmath0 , although the scatter in dex is almost twice as high compared to @xmath2 .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to determine if the scatter could be due to measurement uncertainties alone .",
    "we find that scatter induced by observational errors is @xmath73dex at @xmath0 , resulting in an intrinsic scatter of @xmath74dex .",
    "compared to the fp scatter at @xmath2 , the intrinsic scatter at @xmath0 is still higher .",
    "the larger scatter could have been caused by the large range in age and the bias toward post - starburst galaxies .",
    "in order to explain the larger scatter in the fp of our high - redshift sample , we compare the rest - frame @xmath4 colors of our spectroscopic sample to a larger photometric and more complete galaxy sample .",
    "we use galaxies from the 3d - hst survey ( v4.1 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which were selected to be massive ( @xmath75 ) , non - star - forming according to their @xmath44 versus @xmath45 colors ( see section [ sec : data ] ) , and have a reduced @xmath76 for the best - fit stellar population model to their spectral energy distribution .",
    "rest - frame fluxes for the reference sample were derived with eazy , in a similar fashion as for the spectroscopic sample and are based on photometric redshifts .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) we show the comparison of the rest - frame @xmath4 color as a function of redshift .",
    "the reference sample is binned in redshift , with the median of each bin shown as a big gray circle .",
    "the dashed line shows the best fit of the color as a function of redshift : @xmath77 .",
    "there is very little difference between the reference and the spectroscopic sample at @xmath78 , while at @xmath5 the spectroscopic sample becomes increasingly bluer compared to the median of the reference sample . at @xmath79",
    "we furthermore see a large spread in colors , where some galaxies follow the median of the galaxy population , while other galaxies are offset by more than 0.5 mag .",
    "all spectroscopic samples are relatively blue at higher redshifts , as it is easier to obtain high signal - to - noise spectra for quiescent galaxies compared to the much fainter older quiescent galaxies . in order to estimate the effect of this bias , we use the color difference with the reference sample to calculate a @xmath6 correction for the individual galaxies in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "first , we measure the relative evolution of the @xmath6 from the fp as shown in the top panels of figure [ fig : fig1 ] , under the assumption that @xmath80 , and @xmath81 do not evolve with redshift : @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the fp zeropoint at redshift zero , while @xmath84 is determined from the residuals from the fp for each individual galaxy at redshift @xmath85 @xmath86 note that we have @xmath87 .",
    "next , we use the relation between the rest - frame @xmath4 color and the derived @xmath88 as shown in figure [ fig : fig2](b ) to derive the @xmath6 correction .",
    "there is a correlation between the color and @xmath6 , where the bluest galaxies have the lowest @xmath6 .",
    "this correlation is also predicted by sps models , on which we base our @xmath6 correction . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) we show a @xcite ( @xcite , ma11 ) solar metallicity model ( green line ) , with a truncated star formation history and constant star formation for the first 0.5-gyr .",
    "different ages in this model are indicated on the green line by the circle ( 0.3-gyr ) , diamond ( 1.0-gyr ) , and triangle ( 10-gyr ) .",
    "we approximate the ma11 model by a simple linear fit : @xmath89 ( dashed black line ) .",
    "we use this fit to estimate the @xmath6 correction .    as an example , we highlight the bluest galaxy in our sample , nmbs - cos-7447 at @xmath90 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) , the black arrow indicates the color offset to the @xmath91 color - redshift relation .",
    "the same galaxy has an extremely low @xmath6 as is clear from figure [ fig : fig2](b ) . here",
    "the vertical arrow is again the color offset of this galaxy , but the horizontal arrow now points toward the @xmath6 that the galaxy would have , if it would fall on the color - redshift relation from figure [ fig : fig2](a ) .",
    "the @xmath6 correction that we apply to this individual galaxy is therefore the length of the horizontal arrow .",
    "in other words , for each galaxy we lower the @xmath6 by 1.29 times the color offset , where the factor 1.29 comes from the linear fit to the ma11 model ( dashed line ) .",
    "we note , however , that a steeper @xmath6 versus color relation yields larger @xmath6 corrections , and thus impacts the @xmath6 evolution in section [ sec : mlevo ] .",
    "we show the corrected colors and @xmath6 for the entire sample in figure [ fig : fig2](c ) .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath4 color and @xmath6 of the spectroscopic sample is now similar to that of the reference sample .",
    "with the @xmath6 ( or @xmath67 ) correction applied , we can return to the fp which is shown in the bottom row of figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "as before , the dashed colored lines indicate the best - fit fp with the following zero points in each redshift bin : 0.30 , 0.53 , and 0.62 dex , from low to high redshift .",
    "note that the @xmath0 zero point is significantly lower than before the correction .",
    "the scatter around the fp is greatly reduced for all three redshift bins .",
    "in particular for the highest redshift bin , which had the largest spread in @xmath92 color , the scatter has decreased by almost a factor two .",
    "more quantitatively , the scatter after the fp fit is : @xmath93 , from low to high redshift , respectively .",
    "we note that the small scatter is most likely a lower limit , as we do not include the intrinsic color scatter in our analysis .",
    "in figure [ fig : fig3 ] we show the @xmath6 as derived from the fp offset relative to @xmath2 , as a function of redshift for all galaxies .",
    "we indicate the different zero points from figure [ fig : fig1 ] as dashed lines .",
    "the red solid line is a linear least - square fit to all data , which describes the evolution of the @xmath94 .",
    "here we have anchored the fit to the median of the @xmath2 sdss galaxies . when excluding sdss from the fit , the evolution is more rapid :  @xmath95 .",
    "the evolution is similar to a previous result by @xcite , who find that the @xmath96 in the rest - frame @xmath97 band . here",
    ", the effect of using a slightly bluer rest - frame filter makes very little difference , i.e. , our measured @xmath6 evolution in the rest - frame @xmath97 band is only slightly faster as compared to the @xmath40 band : @xmath98 .    for a fair comparison with previous studies",
    ", we also restrict the fit to @xmath99 , and find a slower evolution than other studies : @xmath100 .",
    "this suggests that the relatively fast evolution of the entire sample is mainly driven by galaxies at @xmath79 .",
    "this is furthermore evident from figure [ fig : fig3](a ) in which almost all @xmath79 galaxies fall below the best fit for the entire sample .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3](b ) shows the @xmath6 evolution with redshift , with the @xmath6 correction included .",
    "this time , we find a milder evolution in the @xmath6 than before : @xmath101 , shown by the red line .",
    "our corrected @xmath6 evolution is similar to previous studies by e.g. , @xcite ( @xmath102 ) , and @xcite ( @xmath103 ) , but slower than the evolution found by @xcite ( @xmath104 ) , and @xcite ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "if we would have used a steeper @xmath6 vs. color relation for the correction , ( e.g.,@xmath106 ) the @xmath6 evolution would be slower@xmath107 .",
    "we also show the single burst ma11 model from figure [ fig : fig2 ] , with a formation redshift of infinity . using the same ma11 model",
    ", we fit the average formation redshift of the biased sample ( figure [ fig : fig3](a ) ) , and estimate @xmath108 . for our corrected sample ( figure [ fig : fig3](b ) ) we estimate the apparent @xmath8 . the large difference highlights the strong selection bias in the sample . both estimates ignore the progenitor bias , which is very strong given the fact that the number density of massive galaxies changes by a factor of @xmath109 @xcite.therefore , the corrected @xmath110 should be regarded as an upper limit for a mass - complete sample that is not supplemented by newly quenched galaxies at later times .",
    "we note that we would find a lower @xmath110 if we were to include progenitor bias in our analysis , or if we would use an evolving mass limit in our sample - selection .",
    "a more detailed study of this effect would require a mass - complete spectroscopic sample .",
    "in section [ sec : bias ] we have corrected our sample for the bias toward young quiescent galaxies . in this correction",
    "we assume that all quiescent galaxies at a particular redshift have the same color and thus the same age .",
    "this assumption is an oversimplification , and the scatter in the fp is actually partly due to age variations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the age variations of quiescent galaxies may increase with redshift , as shown by @xcite .",
    "thus , it is very likely that the scatter in the fp will be induced by larger age variations at higher redshifts .    because we apply the same correction at all redshifts",
    ", we do show that the scatter in the fp due to variation in properties other than age ( e.g. , evolution in stellar mass , size , velocity dispersion , and metallicity ) is approximately constant over time .",
    "however , our @xmath6 evolution is not necessarily the @xmath6 evolution of progenitors and descendants of a fixed population , as the masses , sizes , and velocity dispersions of these galaxies likely evolve systematically with redshift . using a simple model",
    ", we can estimate the effect of structural evolution on the fp and @xmath6 evolution . given that mass evolves as @xmath111",
    "@xcite , we found that @xmath112 in @xcite .",
    "thus , if mass grows by a factor @xmath113 , the @xmath6 evolution ( from equations ( [ eq : deltaml ] ) and ( [ eq : czi ] ) ) including structural evolution can be written as follows : @xmath114 the bias in the @xmath6 evolution induced by structural evolution can therefore be approximated by @xmath115 . assuming a mass growth factor of 0.3  dex , we find that the offset in the @xmath6 due to structural evolution is small : @xmath116 .",
    "we note that if velocity dispersion does not evolve , this effect is larger : @xmath117 dex .",
    "in this letter , we have used stellar kinematic and structural measurements of massive quiescent galaxies ( @xmath118 ) out to @xmath0 to study the evolution of the rest - frame @xmath40-band fp . we utilize this empirical relation between the size , stellar velocity dispersion , and the surface brightness , to constrain the evolution of the @xmath6 .",
    "we find preliminary evidence for the existence of an fp out to @xmath0 , but with larger scatter as compared to the present - day fp for massive quiescent galaxies from the sdss .",
    "there is a rapid evolution of the fp zero point from @xmath2 to @xmath119 .",
    "furthermore , we find that the @xmath120 evolution for galaxies at @xmath79 is faster than for galaxies at @xmath99 .",
    "the larger scatter and fast evolution can be explained by the fact that our spectroscopic sample becomes increasingly bluer at high redshift compared to a mass complete sample of quiescent galaxies .",
    "we calculate the color difference between the galaxies and the mass complete sample , and estimate the systematic effect on the @xmath6 .    with this correction applied , the evolution of the @xmath6 , as derived from the fp , is slower : @xmath101",
    ". a simple model , ignoring progenitor bias , would imply a formation redshift of @xmath8 for a mass complete sample .",
    "the difference between the evolution of our observed sample and the underlying population , highlights the need for a more detailed study of a mass complete spectroscopic sample ."
