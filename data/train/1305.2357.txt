    "the topology of the pattern of contacts between individuals plays a fundamental role in determining the spreading patterns of epidemic processes @xcite .",
    "the first predictions of classical epidemiology @xcite were based on the homogeneous mixing hypothesis , assuming that all individuals have the same chance to interact with other individuals in the population .",
    "this assumption and the corresponding results were challenged by the empirical discovery that the contacts within populations are better described in terms of networks with a non - trivial structure @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies were devoted to understanding the impact of network structure on the properties of the spreading process .",
    "the main result obtained concerned the large susceptibility to epidemic spread shown by networks with a strongly heterogeneous connectivity pattern , as measured by a heavy - tailed degree distribution @xmath0 ( defined as the probability distribution of observing one individual connected to @xmath1 others ) with a a diverging second moment  @xcite .",
    "the original studies considered the interaction networks as static entities , in which connections are frozen or evolve at a time scale much longer than the one of the epidemic process .",
    "this static view of interaction networks hides however the fact that connections appear , disappear , or are rewired on various timescales , corresponding to the creation and termination of relations between pairs of individuals  @xcite .",
    "longitudinal data has traditionally been scarce in social network analysis , but , thanks to recent technological advances , researchers are now in a position to gather data describing the contacts in groups of individuals at several temporal and spatial scales and resolutions .",
    "the analysis of empirical data on several types of human interactions ( corresponding in particular to phone communications or physical proximity ) has unveiled the presence of complex temporal patterns in these systems @xcite . in particular , the heterogeneity and burstiness of the contact patterns are revealed by the study of the distribution of the durations of contacts between pairs of agents , the distribution of the total time in contact of pairs of agents , and the distribution of gap times between two consecutive interactions involving a common individual .",
    "all these distributions are indeed heavy - tailed ( often compatible with power - law behaviors ) , which corresponds to the burstiness of human interactions  @xcite .",
    "these findings have led to a large modeling effort @xcite and stimulated the study of the impact of a network s dynamics on the dynamical processes taking place on top of it .",
    "the processes studied in this context include synchronization  @xcite , percolation  @xcite , social consensus  @xcite , or diffusion  @xcite .",
    "epidemic - like processes have also been explored , both using realistic and toy models of propagation processes @xcite .",
    "the study of simple schematic spreading processes over temporal networks helps indeed expose several properties of their dynamical structure : dynamical processes can in this context be conceived as probing tools of the network s temporal structure @xcite .",
    "the study of spreading patterns on networks is naturally complemented by the formulation of vaccination strategies tailored to the specific topological ( and temporal ) properties of each network .",
    "optimal strategies shed light on how the role and importance of nodes depend on their properties , and can yield importance rankings of nodes . in the case of static networks ,",
    "this issue has been particularly stimulated by the fact that heterogeneous networks with a heavy - tailed degree distribution have a very large susceptibility to epidemic processes , as represented by a vanishingly small epidemic threshold .",
    "in such networks , the simplest strategy consisting in randomly immunizing a fraction of the nodes is ineffective .",
    "more complex strategies , in which nodes with the largest number of connections are immunized , turn out to be effective @xcite but rely on the global knowledge of the network s topology .",
    "this issue is solved by the so - called acquaintance immunization  @xcite , which prescribes the immunization of randomly chosen neighbors of randomly chosen individuals .",
    "few works have addressed the issue of the design of immunization strategies and their respective efficiency in the case of dynamical networks  @xcite . in particular , @xcite consider datasets describing the contacts occurring in a population during a time interval @xmath2 $ ] ; they define and study strategies that use information from the interval @xmath3 $ ] to decide which individuals should be immunized in order to limit the spread during the remaining time @xmath4 $ ] . specifically , the authors introduce two strategies , called _ weight _ and _ recent_. in the weight strategy , a fraction @xmath5 of nodes is selected at random : for each of these nodes , his / her most frequent contact in the interval @xmath3 $ ] is immunized .",
    "in the recent strategy , the last contact before @xmath6 of each of the randomly chosen individuals is immunized .",
    "both strategies are defined in the spirit of the acquaintance immunization , insofar as they select nodes using only partial ( local ) information on the network . using a large @xmath7 , @xcite",
    "show that these strategies perform better than random immunization and show that this is related to the temporal correlations of the dynamical networks .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate several immunization strategies in temporal networks , including the ones considered by @xcite , and address in particular the issue of the length @xmath6 of the `` training window '' , which is highly relevant in the context of real - time , specific tailored strategies .",
    "the scenario we have in mind is indeed the possibility to implement a real - time immunization strategy for an ongoing social event , in which the set of individuals to the immunized is determined by strategies based on preliminary measurements up to a given time @xmath6 .",
    "the immunization problem takes thus a two - fold perspective : the specific rules ( strategy ) to implement , and the interval of time over which preliminary data are collected .",
    "obviously , a very large @xmath6 will lead to more complete information , and a more satisfactory performance for most targeting strategies , but it incurs in the cost of a lengthy data collection . on the other hand",
    ", a short @xmath6 will be cost effective , but yield a smaller amount of information about the observed social dynamics .    in order to investigate the role of the training window length on the efficiency of several immunization strategies , we consider a simple snowball susceptible - infected ( si ) model of epidemic spreading or information diffusion  @xcite . in this model",
    ", individuals can be either in the susceptible ( s ) state , indicating that they have not been reached by the `` infection '' ( or information ) , or they can be in the infectious ( i ) state , meaning that they have been infected by the disease ( or that they have received the information ) and can further propagate it to other individuals .",
    "infected individuals do not recover , i.e. , once they transition to the infectious state they remain indefinitely in that state . despite its simplicity ,",
    "this model has indeed proven to provide interesting insights into the temporal structure and properties of temporal networks . here",
    "we focus on the dynamics of the si model over empirical time - varying social networks .",
    "the networks we consider describe time - resolved face - to - face contacts of individuals in different environments and were measured by the sociopatterns collaboration ( ` http://www.sociopatterns.org ` ) using wearable proximity sensors  @xcite .",
    "we consider the effect on the spread of an si model of the immunization of a fraction of nodes , chosen according to different strategies based on different amounts of information on the contact sequence .",
    "we find a saturation effect in the increase of the efficiency of strategies based on nodes characteristics when the length of the training window is increased .",
    "the efficiency of strategies that include an element of randomness and are based on temporally local information do not perform as well but are largely independent on the amount of information available .    the paper is organized as follows : we briefly describe the empirical data in sec .",

    "the datasets give access , for each pair of participating individuals , to the list of time intervals in which they were in face - to - face close proximity ( @xmath8 m ) , with a temporal resolution of @xmath9 seconds .    in this paper",
    ", we use temporal social networks measured in several different social contexts : the 2010 european semantic web conference ( `` eswc '' ) , a geriatric ward of a hospital in lyon ( `` hosp '' ) , the 2009 acm hypertext conference ( `` ht '' ) , and the 2009 congress of the socit francaise dhygine hospitalire ( `` sfhh '' ) .",
    "these data correspond therefore to the fast dynamics of human contacts over the scale of a few days .",
    "a more detailed description of the corresponding contexts and analyses of these datasets can be found in @xcite . in table",

    ".some properties of the sociopatterns datasets under consideration : number of different individuals engaged in interactions ( @xmath10 ) ; total duration of the contact sequence ( @xmath11 ) , measured in intervals of length @xmath12 sec . ; average degree @xmath13 ( number of different contacts ) and average strength @xmath14 ( total time spent in face - to - face interactions ) of the network of contacts aggregated over the whole sequence ; average number of interactions @xmath15 at each time step .

    "we simulate numerically the susceptible - infected ( si ) spreading dynamics on the above describe datasets of human face - to - face proximity .",
    "the process is initiated by a single infected individual ( `` seed '' ) . at each time step",
    ", each infected individual @xmath16 infects with probability @xmath17 the susceptible individuals @xmath18 with whom @xmath16 is in contact during that time step .",
    "the process stops either when all nodes are infected or at the end of the temporal sequence of contacts .",
    "different individuals have different contact patterns and _ a priori _ contribute differently to the spreading process . in order to quantify the spreading efficiency of a given node @xmath16",
    ", we proceed as follows : we consider @xmath16 as the seed of the si process , all other nodes being susceptible .",
    "we measure the half prevalence time , i.e. , the time @xmath19 needed to reach a fraction of infected nodes equal to @xmath20 of the population . since not all nodes appear simultaneously at @xmath21 of the contact sequence , we define the _ half - infection time _ of seed node @xmath16 as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the time at which node @xmath16 first appears in the contact sequence . the half - infection time @xmath24 can thus be seen as a measure of the spreading power of node @xmath16 : smaller @xmath24 values correspond to more efficient spreading patterns .",
    "we first focus on the deterministic case @xmath25 ( the effects of stochasticity , as given by @xmath26 , are explored in sec .",

    "we note that @xmath24 is quite heterogeneous , ranging from @xmath28 up to @xmath29 .",
    "as the time needed to reach a different fraction of the population , such as e.g. @xmath30 , leads to a similar heterogeneity . ]",
    "divided by the contact sequence duration @xmath11 for the various datasets.,width=321 ]    some nodes are therefore much more efficient spreaders than others .",
    "this implies that the immunization of different nodes could have very different impacts on the spreading process . to estimate this impact ,",
    "we define for each node @xmath16 the infection delay ratio @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the half - infection time obtained when node @xmath18 is the seed of the spreading process and node @xmath16 is immunized , and the ratio is averaged over all possible seeds @xmath34 and over different starting times for the si process ( the half - infection time being much smaller than the total duration of the contact sequence , @xmath35 ) . is not present during the time window in which the si process is simulated ; in this case , @xmath36 . ]",

    "figure [ fig : rank_tau ] displays a rank plot of @xmath31 for various datasets . as expected , the immunization of a single node does most often lead to a limited delay of the spreading dynamics .",
    "interestingly however , @xmath31 is broadly distributed and large values are also observed .     for various datasets.,width=321 ]",
    "the infection delay ratio of a single node @xmath16 , @xmath31 , can be generalized to the case of the immunization of any set of nodes @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "we measure the spreading slowing down obtained when immunizing the set @xmath39 through the infection delay ratio @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the half - infection times of node @xmath18 when all the nodes of set @xmath39 are immunized , and the average is performed over all possible seeds @xmath42 and different starting times for the si process .",
    "in addition to slowing down the propagation process , the immunization of certain individuals can also block the spreading paths towards other , non - immunized , individuals , limiting in this way the final number of infected individuals .",
    "we measure this effect through the _ average outbreak size ratio _",
    "@xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the number of infected individuals ( outbreak size ) for an si process with seed @xmath18 , with and without immunization of the set @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the ratio is averaged over all possible seeds @xmath42 and over different starting times of the si process .",
    "an immunization strategy is defined by the choice of the set @xmath39 of nodes to be immunized .",
    "we define here different strategies , and we compare their efficiencies in section [ sec : numerical - results ] by measuring @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "more precisely , for each contact sequence of duration @xmath11 we consider an initial temporal window @xmath48 $ ] over which various properties of nodes can be measured .",
    "a fraction @xmath5 of the nodes , chosen according to different possible rules , is then selected and immunized ( it forms the set @xmath39 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are computed by simulating the si process with and without immunization and averaging over starting seeds and times . for each selection rule ,",
    "the two relevant parameters are @xmath5 and @xmath49 .",
    "larger fractions @xmath5 are naturally expected to lead to larger @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "here we also consider the effect of @xmath6 , where a larger @xmath6 corresponds to a larger amount of information on the contact sequence . we investigate whether and how more information about the contact sequence yields a higher efficiency of the immunization strategy .",
    "we consider the following strategies ( or `` protocols '' ) :    * degree protocol .",
    "we immunize the @xmath50 individuals with the highest aggregated degree in @xmath48 $ ] @xcite ; the aggregated degree of an individual @xmath16 corresponds to the number of different other individuals with whom @xmath16 has been in contact during @xmath48 $ ] ; * betwennness centrality protocol .",
    "we immunize the @xmath51 individuals with the highest betweenness centrality measured on the aggregated network in @xmath48 $ ] @xcite ; * acquaintance protocol .",
    "we choose randomly an individual and immunize one of his contacts in @xmath3 $ ] , repeating the process until @xmath50 individuals are immunized @xcite ; * weight protocol .",
    "we choose randomly an individual and immunize his most frequent contact in @xmath3 $ ] , repeating for various elements until @xmath50 individuals are immunized @xcite ; * recent protocol .",
    "we choose randomly an individual and immunize his last contact in @xmath3 $ ] , repeating for various elements until @xmath50 individuals are immunized @xcite .    as a benchmark",
    ", we also consider the following two strategies :    * random protocol .",
    "we immunize @xmath50 individuals chosen randomly among all nodes ; * @xmath52-protocol .",
    "we immunize the first @xmath50 individuals with the highest @xmath31 , with @xmath31 calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) in the interval @xmath3 $ ] .    the * rn * strategy uses no information about the contact sequence and we use it as a worst case performance baseline .",
    "the * t * strategy makes use , through the quantity @xmath31 , of the entire information about the contact sequence as well as complete information about the average effect of node immunization on si processes taking place over the contact sequence .",
    "it could thus be expected to yield the best performance among all strategies .    the * a * , * w * ,",
    "* r * and * rn * strategies involve a random choice of individuals .",
    "in each of these cases , we average the results over @xmath53 independent runs ( each run corresponding to an independent choice of the individuals to immunize ) .",
    "we first study the role of the temporal window @xmath6 on the efficiency of the various immunization strategies . to this aim , we consider two values of the fraction of immunized individuals , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and compute the infection delay ratio @xmath52 as a function of @xmath6 for each immunization protocol , and for each dataset .",
    "the results , displayed in figs .  [ fig : delay_dt ] and [ fig : delay_dt_f02 ] , show that an increase in the amount of information available , as measured by an increase in @xmath6 , does not necessarily translate into an larger efficiency of the immunization , as quantified by the delay of the epidemic process .",
    "the @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 protocols have in all cases lower efficiencies that remain almost independent on @xmath49 . moreover , and in contrast with the results of @xcite on a different dataset , @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not perform better than @xmath56 . on the other hand , the immunization efficiency of the @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 protocols increases at small @xmath6 and reaches larger values for all the datasets",
    ". as expected , the * rn * protocol , which does not use any information , fares the worst . for @xmath54 ,",
    "all protocols yield an infection delay ratio that is largely independent from @xmath6 for large enough training windows @xmath62 . for @xmath55 , the increase of @xmath52",
    "is more gradual but tends to saturate for @xmath63 as well . in all cases ,",
    "a limited knowledge of the contact time series is therefore sufficient to estimate which nodes have to be immunized in order to delay the spreading dynamics , especially for small @xmath5 , i.e. , in case of limited resources .",
    "interestingly , in some cases , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 protocols lead to a larger delay of the spread than the @xmath61 protocol , despite the fact that the latter is designed to explicitly identify the nodes which yield the maximal ( individual ) infection delay ratio .",
    "this could be ascribed to correlations between the activity patterns of nodes , leading to a non - linear dependence on @xmath5 of the immunization efficiency ( in particular , the list of nodes to immunize is built using the list of degrees , betweenness centralities , and @xmath31 values computed on the original network , without recomputing the rankings each time a node is removed ) .",
    "figure [ fig : infect_dt ] reports the outbreak ratio @xmath64 as a function of the temporal window @xmath6 for different vaccination protocols .",
    "results similar to the case of the infection delay ratio are recovered : the reduction in outbreak size , as quantified by the average outbreak size ratio defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , reaches larger values for the degree , betweenness centrality and @xmath61 protocols than for the @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 protocols .",
    "we finally investigate the robustness of our results when the fraction of immunized individuals varies . to this aim , we use a fixed length @xmath65 for the training window and we plot the infection delay ratio @xmath66 and the average outbreak size ratio @xmath64 as a function of @xmath5 , respectively , in figs .",
    "[ fig : delay_f ] and [ fig : infect_f ] .",
    "the results show that the ranking of the strategies given by these two quantities is indeed robust with respect to variations in the fraction of immunized individuals .",
    "in particular , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 protocols perform much better than the @xmath57 and @xmath58 protocols for at least one of the efficiency indicators .",
    "real time - varying networks are characterized by the presence of bursty behavior and temporal correlations , which impact the unfolding of dynamical processes @xcite . for instance , if a contact between vertices @xmath16 and @xmath18 takes place only at the ( discrete ) times @xmath67 , it can not be used in the course of a dynamical processes at any time @xmath68 .",
    "a propagation process initiated at a given seed might therefore not be able to reach all the other nodes , but only those belonging to the seed s set of influence @xcite , i.e. , those that can be reached from the seed by a time respecting path .    in order to investigate the role of temporal correlations , we consider a reshuffled version of the data in which correlations between consecutive interaction among individuals are removed .",
    "to this aim , we consider the list of events @xmath69 describing a contact between @xmath16 and @xmath18 at time @xmath70 and reshuffle at random their time stamps to build a synthetic uncorrelated new contact sequence .",
    "we then apply the same immunization protocols to this uncorrelated temporal network .",
    "figure [ fig : delay_sran ] displays the corresponding results for the infection delay ratio @xmath66 computed for si spreading simulations performed on a randomized dataset ( similar results are obtained for the average outbreak size ratio @xmath64 ) .",
    "we have checked that our results hold across different realizations of the randomization procedure .",
    "the efficiency of the protocol is then largely independent of the training window length .",
    "as the contact sequence is random and uncorrelated , all temporal windows are statistically equivalent , and no new information is added by increasing @xmath6 : in particular , as nodes appear in the randomly reshuffled sequence with a constant probability that depends on their empirical activity , the ranking of nodes according for instance to their aggregated degree remains very stable as @xmath6 changes , so that a very small @xmath6 is enough to reach a stable such ranking .",
    "nevertheless , the efficiency ranking of the different protocols is unchanged : the degree , betweenness centrality , and @xmath61 protocols outperform the other immunization strategies . moreover , the efficiency levels reached are higher than for the original contact sequence : the correlations present in the data limit the immunization efficiency in the case of the present datasets .",
    "note that studies of the role of temporal correlations on the speeding or slowing down of spreading processes have led to contrasting results , as discussed by @xcite , possibly because of the different models and dataset properties considered .",
    "we also verify the robustness of our results using a probabilistic si process with @xmath71 .",
    "we consider the same immunization strategies and we compute the same quantities as in the case @xmath25 . given the probabilistic nature of the spreading process , we now average the above observables over @xmath53 realizations of the si process .",
    "figure [ fig : delay02 ] shows that our results hold in the case of a probabilistic epidemics spreading , although in this case the infection delay ratio @xmath66 presents a noisy behavior , due to the stochastic fluctuations originated in the probabilistic spreading dynamics .",
    "the average outbreak ratio @xmath64 , not shown , behaves in a very similar way .",
    "thus , also in this more realistic case with @xmath72 , a limited knowledge of the contact sequence is enough to identify which individuals to immunize .",
    "within the growing body of work concerning temporal networks , few studies have yet considered the issue of immunization strategies and of their efficiency . in general terms , the amount of information that can be extracted from the data at hand about the characteristics of the nodes and links is a crucial ingredient for the design of optimal immunization strategies . understanding how much information",
    "is needed in order to design good ( and even optimal ) strategies , and how the efficiency of the strategies depend on the information used , remain largely an open questions whose answer might depend on the precise dataset under investigation .",
    "we have here leveraged several datasets describing contact patterns between individuals in varied contexts , and performed simulations in order to measure the effect of different immunization strategies on simple si spreading processes .",
    "we have considered immunization strategies designed according to different principles , different ways of using information about the data , and different levels of randomness .",
    "strategies range from the completely random @xmath73 to the @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 strategies that include a random choice , to the fully deterministic @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 that are based on various node s characteristics .",
    "moreover , @xmath59 uses only local information while @xmath60 and @xmath61 rely on the global knowledge of the connection patterns .",
    "the strategies that are most efficient , as measured by the change in the velocity of the spread and by the final number of nodes infected , are the deterministic protocols , namely @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "strategies based on random choices , even when they are designed in order to try to immunize `` important '' nodes , are less efficient .",
    "we have moreover investigated how the performance of the various strategies depends on the time window on which the nodes characteristics are measured .",
    "a longer time window corresponds indeed a priori to an increase in the available information and hence to the possibility to better optimize the strategies .",
    "we have found , however , a clear saturation effect in the efficiency increase of the various strategies as the training window on which they are designed increases .",
    "this is particularly the case when the fraction of immunized nodes is small ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_dt ] ) , for which a small @xmath6 is enough to reach saturation , while the saturation is more gradual for larger fractions of immunized ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_dt_f02 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the strategies that involve a random component yield results that are largely independent on the amount of information considered .    in order to understand these results in more details , we have considered the evolution with time of the nodes properties .",
    "in particular , we compare the largest degree nodes in the fully aggregated network with the set of nodes @xmath74 , chosen by following the @xmath59 strategy on the training window @xmath3 $ ] . to this aim",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fhighestdegnode ] the median of the degrees , _ in the fully aggregated network _ , of the nodes of @xmath75 , as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the median rapidly reaches its final value , showing that , even for short @xmath6 , the set of immunized nodes @xmath76 has similar properties ( here the degree ) than what would be obtained by taking into account the whole dataset of length @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig : degotime ] moreover displays the evolution of the degree aggregated over the training window @xmath3 $ ] , as a function of @xmath77 , for several nodes .",
    "the fraction @xmath54 of nodes with the largest degree in the fully aggregated network are ranked among the most connected nodes already for small training windows @xmath6 . for @xmath55 ,",
    "the ranking fluctuates more and takes longer to stabilize .",
    "overall , while the precise ordering scheme of the nodes according to their degree is not entirely stable with respect to increasing values of @xmath6 , a coarse ordering is rather rapidly reached : the nodes that reach a large degree at the end of the dataset are rapidly ranked among the highest degree nodes , and the nodes that in the end have a low degree are as well rapidly categorized as such .",
    "this confirms the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : fhighestdegnode ] and explains why the @xmath59 strategy reaches its best efficiency even at short training windows for small @xmath5 , and with a more gradual saturation for larger fractions of immunized nodes .",
    "the fact that high degree nodes are identified early on in the information collection process comes here as a surprise : for a temporal network with poissonian events , all the information on the relative importance of links and nodes is present in the data as soon as the observation time is larger than the typical timescale of the dynamics ; this is however a priori not the case for the bursty dynamics observed in real - world temporal networks .",
    "various factors can explain the observed stability in the ranking of nodes .",
    "on the one hand , some nodes can possess some intrinsic properties giving them an important a priori position in the network ( for instance , nurses in a hospital , or senior scientists in a conference ) that ensure them a larger degree than other nodes even at short times .",
    "on the other hand , the stability of the ranking could in fact be only temporary , and due to the fact that nodes arriving earlier in the dataset have a larger probability to gather a large number of contacts . in this case , the observed stability of the ordering scheme could decrease for data collected on longer timescales .",
    "another reason for the saturation of the efficiency of the various strategies is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : degotimeslice ] , which displays the evolution of the degree of some nodes in the network aggregated on a temporal window @xmath78 $ ] versus @xmath79 .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the importance of different nodes varies strongly depending on the initial time chosen for aggregation , and even a node with a large degree in the network aggregated on @xmath3 $ ] can have temporarily a small degree in a subsequent time window .",
    "the strong variation in the degree of nodes at different times clearly limits the efficiency not only of immunization strategies based on information that is local in time , but even of strategies based on aggregated information .",
    "the main conclusion of our study is therefore twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "a limited amount of information on the contact patterns is sufficient to design relevant immunization strategies ; on the other hand , the strong variation in the contact patterns significantly limits the efficiency of any strategy based on importance ranking of nodes , even if such deterministic strategies still perform much better than the `` recent '' or `` weight '' protocols that are generalizations of the `` acquaintance '' strategy .",
    "moreover , strategies based on simple quantities such as the aggregated degree perform as well as , or better , than strategies based on more involved measures such as the infection delay ratio defined in sec .  [ sec : epid - models - numer ] .",
    "we also note that , contrarily to the case investigated by @xcite , the `` recent '' and `` weight '' strategies , which try to exploit the temporal structure of the data , do not perform clearly better than the simpler `` acquaintance '' strategy .",
    "such apparent discrepancy might have various causes .",
    "in particular , @xcite consider spreading processes starting exactly at @xmath80 while we average over different possible starting times .",
    "the datasets used are moreover of different nature ( @xcite indeed obtain contrasted results for different datasets ) and have different temporal resolutions .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the different datasets properties would be needed in order to fully understand this point , as discussed for instance by @xcite .",

    "<S> spreading processes represent a very efficient tool to investigate the structural properties of networks and the relative importance of their constituents , and have been widely used to this aim in static networks . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider simple disease spreading processes on empirical time - varying networks of contacts between individuals , and compare the effect of several immunization strategies on these processes . </S>",
    "<S> an immunization strategy is defined as the choice of a set of nodes ( individuals ) who can not catch nor transmit the disease . </S>",
    "<S> this choice is performed according to a certain ranking of the nodes of the contact network . </S>",
    "<S> we consider various ranking strategies , focusing in particular on the role of the training window during which the nodes properties are measured in the time - varying network : longer training windows correspond to a larger amount of information collected and could be expected to result in better performances of the immunization strategies . </S>",
    "<S> we find instead an unexpected saturation in the efficiency of strategies based on nodes characteristics when the length of the training window is increased , showing that a limited amount of information on the contact patterns is sufficient to design efficient immunization strategies . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is balanced by the large variations of the contact patterns , which strongly alter the importance of nodes from one period to the next and therefore significantly limit the efficiency of any strategy based on an importance ranking of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that the efficiency of strategies that include an element of randomness and are based on temporally local information do not perform as well but are largely independent on the amount of information available .    </S>",
