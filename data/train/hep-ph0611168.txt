    "inclusive semi - leptonic decays are the cleanest way to access the matrix elements of the ckm matrix . in order to achieve precision in the determination of the ckm parameters",
    "a reliable theoretical framework is needed in addition to precise data . from the off - diagonal ckm matrix elements only @xmath5 and @xmath3",
    "are known very precisely from direct measurements @xcite , and both determinations can be related to a clean theoretical treatment : while the theoretical machinery for the determination of @xmath5 from @xmath6 decays is chiral perturbation theory , the theoretical basis for the precision determination of @xmath3 is the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) .    the hqe @xcite has become a very reliable theoretical tool , in particular for semi - leptonic decays . at present , data on inclusive semi - leptonic decays @xmath7 are so precise that not only a determination of @xmath3 at the level of 2% accuracy is possible @xcite , but also a check of the consistency of the hqe can be performed by determining the parameters of the hqe in different ways @xcite .",
    "these parameters are the kinetic energy parameter @xmath8 and the chromo - magnetic moment @xmath9 at order @xmath10 and the darwin term @xmath11 and the spin - orbit term @xmath12 at order @xmath1 .",
    "we shall stick here with the kinetic scheme , the alternative @xmath13 scheme @xcite yields similar precision . using the moments of the hadronic invariant mass spectrum and the charged lepton energy spectrum these parameters",
    "can be consistently determined with an accuracy of about ten percent .    within the hqe the order of the moments",
    "is related to the order in the @xmath0 expansion @xcite .",
    "for example , the moments @xmath14 for the case of charmless semi - leptonic @xmath4 decays are determined by the contributions of the order @xmath15 .",
    "thus in order to exploit precise measurements of the lepton energy spectrum , i.e.  measurements of higher moments , it is mandatory to perform the theoretical calculation up to a sufficient order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the current theoretical state of the art which is used in the fits is already quite elaborate . at leading order ( which is the partonic rate ) the full @xmath16 and the partial @xmath17 result",
    "is known , while the @xmath10 and @xmath1 results are used at tree level .",
    "hence the leading uncertainties are the @xmath16 contributions at @xmath10 and the tree level contributions to order @xmath2 .    in the present paper",
    "we present a systematic way to perform the calculation of higher order terms in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "this approach is then used to perform the complete calculation of the @xmath2 terms for the semi - leptonic decay @xmath7 , keeping the charm mass to all orders . in the next section",
    "we shall outline our calculational method , which amounts to a systematization for the tree - level calculation of terms to some order @xmath15 .",
    "this method is then applied to the case of @xmath2 . in section  [ hqeparameters ]",
    "we identify and discuss the parameters appearing at @xmath2 , where we find in total five independent matrix elements , which , however , have a simple physical interpretation . in section  [ semilep ]",
    "we discuss the impact of these additional terms on the analysis of semi - leptonic decays .",
    "in this section we outline a method which allows us - at least in principle - to calculate the decay rates of semi - leptonic inclusive decays at any order in the @xmath0 expansion at tree level . the starting point for such",
    "a calculation is the hadronic tensor , which according to the optical theorem can be related to the discontinuity of a time - ordered product of currents across a cut .",
    "thus one starts with a correlator of two hadronic currents @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the left - handed current , @xmath21 the four velocity of the decaying b meson and @xmath22 the momentum transfer to the leptons .",
    "it is convenient to decompose this correlator into lorentz scalar structure functions according to @xmath23 where the scalar @xmath24 are only functions of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    using the optical theorem",
    "we obtain for the relevant imaginary parts a similar decomposition : @xmath27 and the hadronic tensor , needed for the transition amplitude , can be computed from @xmath28 by @xmath29 the differential decay rate is then obtained by contracting the hadronic tensor with the leptonic tensor @xmath30 , and one obtains @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the corresponding phase space element .    using the charged lepton energy @xmath33 , the leptonic invariant mass @xmath34 and the rescaled total lepton energy @xmath35 as independent variables one obtains the triple differential decay rate in terms of the scalar functions @xmath36 @xmath37     decays . ]",
    "the tree - level expansion in @xmath0 is most easily set up by studying the feynman diagram shown in fig .",
    "the double line denotes the propagator of a charm quark which is propagating in the background field of the soft gluons of the @xmath4 meson .",
    "after rescaling the @xmath38 quark momentum according to @xmath39 we write for the background field propagator @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the background gluon field",
    ".    the tree level ope for semi - leptonic processes is obtained by multiplying ( [ bgfprop ] ) by the appropriate dirac matrices for the left handed current ( [ sm_current ] ) . a calculation to order",
    "@xmath15 requires to expand this expression to @xmath43 order in the covariant derivative @xmath44 according to @xmath45 we note that this keeps track of the ordering of the covariant derivatives .",
    "the remaining task is to evaluate the forward matrix elements of operators of the from @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) carries the spinor indices @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the field @xmath48 is still the full qcd field , but redefined by a phase factor to remove the large piece of the @xmath38-quark momentum according to ( [ bquarkmom ] ) .",
    "this field satisfies the useful relations @xmath51 which follow from the equation of motion for the @xmath38 quark field . here",
    "@xmath52 are the projectors on the `` large '' and `` small '' components of a dirac spinor .",
    "note that this way of expanding will yield only matrix elements of local operators ; however , these matrix elements contain still a nontrivial mass dependence , which will be discussed in the following .",
    "the evaluation of these matrix elements is performed most conveniently in a recursive fashion .",
    "the starting point is always the matrix element of highest dimension , i.e. the one with the maximal number of covariant derivatives . for these matrix elements one may neglect all contributions of order @xmath0 relative to this matrix element ;",
    "in other words , this matrix element may be treated in the static limit .",
    "thus the first step is to consider the static limit of the forward matrix element of the highest dimensional operator , which has the form @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the generalization of the pauli matrices to the case @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the static limit of the @xmath4 meson state @xmath57 .",
    "the tensor structures @xmath58 and @xmath4 have to be related to a minimal set of fundamental matrix elements which are defined by contracting the indices in the various possible ways . in the following ,",
    "these matrix elements are called _ basic parameters _ for a certain order in @xmath0 .",
    "for example , at order @xmath1 these basic parameters are the darwin term @xmath59 and the spin - orbit term @xmath60 defined by @xmath61 while at order @xmath10 the basic parameters are the kinetic energy parameter @xmath62 and the chomomagnetic moment @xmath63 given by @xmath64    the hat above the quantitites means that we have defined these parameters in a covariant way .",
    "the definitions which have been recently used refer to the spatial components of the derivatives only and differ from the ones used here by higher - order terms in the @xmath65 expansion .",
    "the usual definitions of these quantities are given by @xmath66 where the spatial components are @xmath67 at @xmath2 the correction terms in the relations between the covariant and the usual definition do matter and are given in the next section .",
    "once the tensors @xmath58 and @xmath4 for the matrix elements of the highest order in the @xmath0 expansion have been expressed in terms of these fundamental parameters , one proceeds in a similar way with the matrix elements of dimension @xmath68 .",
    "however , now we have to take into account all possible dirac structures , such that @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the complete set of the sixteen dirac matrices . by using the fact that the relations ( [ use1]-[use5 ] ) connect different orders of the @xmath0 expansion we may express the tensor coefficients @xmath71 in terms of the basic parameters of the order @xmath72 and the ones of the order @xmath15 .",
    "this prescription defines a way to recursively compute the relevant matrix elements of the @xmath0 expansion up to order @xmath15 at tree level , starting from the operator of highest dimension .",
    "thus the leading matrix element of dimension three will then be expressed by this recursive method as a series in @xmath15 involving all the basic parameters up to this order .",
    "finally , the hadronic tensor is obtained from the trace formula @xmath73 where the tree level expansion of the background - field propagator ( [ bgfexpansion ] ) automatically yields the correct ordering of the covariant derivatives .",
    "note that this saves us from computing the one- and even more - gluon matrix elements which would be necessary to obtain the correct ordering of covariant derivatives in the standard computation .    in the follwing",
    "we explicitely perform this recursion to order @xmath2 , and we first identify the basic parameters for the order @xmath2 .",
    "at @xmath2 we have to deal with operators of dimension 7 , containing four covariant derivatives .",
    "we find in total five basic parameters at order @xmath2 , three of which are spin independent , while two are spin dependent .",
    "written in a covariant form we define the basic parameters of order @xmath2 to be @xmath74 which are real , since they are forward matrix elements of hermitean operators .    in order to obtain some intuition concerning the physical meaning of these parameters , we may relate them to some more intuitive quantities , which are @xmath75    the basic parameters defined in ( [ p1]-[p5 ] ) can be related to the intuitive quantities by and the intuitive quantities are not entirely unique .",
    "for example , @xmath76 could also be defined by the completely symmetrized combination of the covariant derivatives ] @xmath77 which also gives some information on the sign of the non - perturbative parameters .",
    "these parameters have to be determined independently from the lower - order parameters ; however , for a numerical estimate it is useful to note that some of these parameters can be estimated in naive factorization , such as @xmath78 while the two remaining matrix elements do not have a simple interpretation in naive factorization .",
    "based on the interpretation of the parameters @xmath79 in terms of physical quantities we define a `` guestimate '' for the basic parameters @xmath79 by @xmath80 where at least the sign of the contributions should be correctly reproduced .    in this way",
    "all the basic matrix elements up to order @xmath2 have been identified and the remaining task is to express any matrix element in terms of these basic quantities according to ( [ general ] ) . in appendix  [ me ] we list all the necessary general matrix elements up to dimension seven in terms of the basic parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath81 , @xmath60 and @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we may now consider the relation between the covariant definition of the basic parameters and the usual ones shown in ( [ mupiu]-[rholsu ] ) .",
    "this relation is given by @xmath83     \\\\",
    "\\hat\\mu_g^2   & = \\mu_g^2 - \\frac{1}{m_b } [ \\rho_d^3 + \\rho_{\\rm ls}^3 ]                                                -   \\frac{1}{4 m_b^2 } [ s_2 + s_3 + 4 s_5 ]    \\\\",
    "\\hat\\rho_d^3 & =    \\rho_d^3 \\vphantom{\\frac{s_1}{m_b } } \\\\      \\hat\\rho_{\\rm ls}^3   & = \\rho_{\\rm ls}^3 - \\frac{s_1}{m_b }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the remaining task is to evaluate the scalar components of the hadronic tensor at tree level using ( [ trace ] ) and the formulae from the appendix .",
    "we first compute the correlator ( [ tprod ] ) involving the time - ordered product . from the scalar components shown in ( [ stprod ] ) we need only @xmath84 ,",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 due to current conservation of the leptonic current .",
    "the resulting expressions up to order @xmath2 are tedious and are given in appendix  [ ti ]    taking the imaginary part to obtain the components of @xmath87 according to ( [ ot ] ) we use the relation @xmath88 from which we can obtain the triple differential rate up to @xmath2 at tree level using ( [ tdr ] ) .",
    "the resulting expressions of the double differential rate , the single differential rate and the total rate are quite lengthy and given completely in appendix  [ rates ] .",
    "the relevant quantities for the experimental analysis and the determination of @xmath3 are the moments of the lepton energy spectrum and the moments of the hadronic invariant mass spectrum . in order to get a quantitative idea of the effect of the @xmath2 terms we consider the @xmath2 to the moments , normalized to the partonic rate at tree level .",
    "thus we define @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the contribution of order @xmath2 .",
    "we first study the dependence of the @xmath91 contributions to the moments on the different non - perturbative parameters @xmath79 .",
    "we write the moments as @xmath92    .values of the coefficients @xmath93 with a weak dependence on @xmath94 .",
    "the values quoted are for @xmath95 gev . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the contribution to the total rate is very small ; using our estimates for the parameters @xmath79 we get @xmath96 resulting in a completely negligible shift of the central value of @xmath3 from the terms of the order @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we presented the complete result for the @xmath91 contributions to the semileptonic rate at tree level .",
    "although we have in total five new , non - perturbative parameters , we can use the known matrix elements to order @xmath97 to estimate the size of the contributions .",
    "it turns out that the size of the @xmath2 terms is `` normal '' , i.e. we do not see any abnormally large coefficients in the @xmath0 expansion , at least in this tree level calculation .",
    "the formulae collected in the appendix allow us to include now the @xmath91 contributions into the moment analyses of semi - leptonic decays .",
    "in particular , the fourth central moment in @xmath98 is dominated by the @xmath2 terms , so these terms are required for a sensible analysis of higher - order moments .",
    "the method suggested here allows in principle the calculation of arbitrarily high orders in the @xmath0 expansion at tree level .",
    "however , the limitation is the number of basic parameters , which is presumably growing factorially , leading to a factorially growing effort to express the general matrix elements through the basic parameters .    on the other hand , assuming that the @xmath99 terms also behave `` normally '' , the uncertainty from these contributions in the determination of @xmath3 will really be extremely small .",
    "the uncertainty currently assigned to the use of the hqe for the detemination of @xmath3 is about 1% ; a conservative estimate is to use the size of the last term calculated as the uncertainty means that the uncertainty in the @xmath3 determination due to hqe may be reduced to @xmath100 .",
