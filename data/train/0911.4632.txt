    "the standard model ( sm ) , when put in a more general context , is affected by the hierarchy problem , since within the sm the higgs boson gets a quadratically divergent contribution to its mass if the model is considered as an effective theory only valid up to some high energy scale .",
    "if one considers a situation in which physics is perturbative , precision electroweak physics indicates that the higgs mass can not be very large and that the effective cutoff is preferably heavier than @xmath0 tev  @xcite .",
    "this requires a fine tuning from the eventual scale of new physics to the electroweak scale .",
    "little higgs models are effective theories based on the non - linear sigma model structure where the higgs field is a nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb ) of a global symmetry which is spontaneously broken at some higher scale by an expectation value @xmath1 ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the higgs field acquires its mass through symmetry breaking at the electroweak scale and , protected by the approximate global symmetry , it remains light .",
    "the original little higgs models , however , are disfavoured by electroweak precision tests @xcite , which push the scale @xmath1 above few tev thus restoring the fine tuning problem . on the other hand , models with an extra parity ( called t - parity @xcite )",
    "are in agreement with present constraints while allowing a scale @xmath1 which is sufficiently light to be in the lhc range and solve the little hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "t - parity is also motivated by the fact that it offers a stable candidate for dark matter  @xcite .",
    "generic little higgs theories predict , at a scale of the order of 1 tev , new particles responsible for cancelling the standard model quadratic divergences at 1-loop : heavy weak gauge bosons , new heavy scalars , new fermions that are partners of the top quark and partners of the light fermions .",
    "these new particles are charged under the t - parity .",
    "in addition there are also t - odd doublet partners for every standard model fermionic doublets . as a typical example we consider the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) . in this work",
    ", we study the possibility of observing the t - odd heavy leptons in the single ( @xmath2 ) and pair production ( @xmath3 ) of heavy charged t - odd leptons at lhc .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the purely leptonic decay modes .",
    "the ( @xmath4 ) production , even though it may give rise to a four charged lepton channel , is less interesting because the smaller cross section , together with small leptonic branching ratios , renders the signal too feeble at the lhc .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section [ section:2 ] we discuss the main features of the model we have considered for our analysis and also our framework for event generation and detector simulations . in section [ section:3 ] we compute the production of single charged t - odd lepton in the channel @xmath5 . in section [ section:4 ]",
    "we discuss pair production of t - odd charged leptons . in section [ section:5 ]",
    "we discuss the pair production of t - odd neutral leptons .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ section:6 ] with the summary of the results .",
    "in the following , we briefly review the main features of the littlest higgs model with t - parity and in particular of the t - odd heavy fermions . the model is based on a @xmath6 global symmetry , of which a @xmath7 \\times [ su(2)_2\\times u(1)_2 ] $ ] subgroup is gauged .",
    "a discrete parity ( t - parity ) exchanges the two @xmath8 $ ] groups . at the scale @xmath1 ,",
    "the global symmetry is spontaneously broken down to a @xmath9 group resulting in 14 massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons and the gauged symmetry is reduced to its diagonal @xmath10 subgroup identified with the standard model gauge group .",
    "the lightest heavy gauge boson , @xmath11 , is the partner of the photon and is generally the lightest stable t - odd particle in the model .",
    "the implementation of t - parity in the fermion sector requires that each standard model fermion doublet is replaced by the fields @xmath12 @xcite , where each @xmath13 is a doublet under one @xmath14 and a singlet under the other .",
    "t - parity simply exchanges @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the t - even combination of @xmath13 is identified with the standard model fermion doublet while the other ( t - odd ) one is its heavy partner @xmath17 .",
    "mass terms for these t - odd heavy fermions are generated by yukawa interactions with additional t - odd @xmath18 singlet fermions . assuming a universal and flavour diagonal yukawa coupling @xmath19 , for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( the t - odd heavy partners of the standard model leptons ) , we have the following masses m_l_h = _ l f  , m__h = _ l f ( 1 - )  ; as the scale @xmath1 is typically of the order 500 gev or larger , it is clear that the t - odd heavy partners have nearly equal masses as they are only split by @xmath22 effects . with the simplifying assumption of universal and flavour diagonal yukawa couplings",
    "we therefore have only two free parameters : the new mass scale @xmath1 and the flavour independent yukawa coupling @xmath19 .",
    "we use in the following the feynman rules of mirror fermions in accordance with @xcite .",
    "these modifications in the couplings of t - odd fermions provide the correct result at the order @xmath22 for the cancellation of the divergences in z - penguin diagrams in various flavour changing decays .",
    "the yukawa coupling @xmath19 in general depends on flavour and this can in turn generate lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) in this class of models @xcite . for our analysis",
    "we will assume that @xmath19 is flavour blind and universal , hence it does not give rise to new sources of flavour violation .",
    "the cross - sections and branching ratios for t - odd lepton production and decays have been calculated with calchep v2.5.4 @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we have used the modified lht model file provided in @xcite . in the modified model file",
    "we included the changes in the feynman rules of mirror fermions in accordance with @xcite .",
    "the lhc cross - sections were calculated for the center of mass energy of 10 and 14 tev .",
    "we have used cteq6l pdfs ( parton distribution functions ) with qcd coupling scale set to @xmath23 .",
    "the event simulations always refer to the 14 tev case : the signal events were generated using calchep v2.5.4 and were interfaced to pythia 6.4.21 @xcite by les houches event interface ( lhe ) @xcite .",
    "the isr / fsr switches in pythia were kept on in the simulations . in order to make more realistic estimates",
    "we have further passed the events through the fast atlas detector simulator atlfast @xcite for realistic detector effects .",
    "atlfast identifies isolated leptons , b and @xmath24 jets .",
    "it also reconstructs missing energy .",
    "the jets in atlfast are reconstructed using a simple cone algorithm .",
    "the sm backgrounds , on- and off - shell w production and @xmath25 production , were generated using pythia 6.4.21 and were further processed through atlfast .",
    "the @xmath26 events were generated using madgraph @xcite and were interfaced to pythia 6.4.21 for isr / fsr effects via lhe .",
    "the events thus generated were further passed through atlfast .",
    "the input parameters of the lht model that are relevant for our analysis are the scale @xmath1 and the coupling @xmath19 .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : br31 ] , in the region @xmath27 , the branching ratios are : br(_h",
    "a_h ) = 1  , br(_h a_h ) = 1  . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the leptons became heavier than the gauge bosons @xmath29 and @xmath30 and other modes start opening up : when @xmath31 , the dominant decay modes become @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is known that in this range ( @xmath31 ) @xmath29 decays to @xmath34 with almost 100% branching ratio @xcite .",
    "we show the dependence of the t - odd lepton branching ratios on the symmetry breaking scale @xmath1 in figure [ fig : br1 ] for charged t - odd lepton ( @xmath35 ) and in figure [ fig : br2 ] for neutral t - odd lepton ( @xmath21 ) for some indicative values of @xmath19 .    -.3",
    "cm    -.3 cm",
    "in a reasonable range of parameters of the lht model , it is possible to produce a single charged t - odd lepton in association with the t - odd heavy neutrino at lhc .",
    "initially lhc is expected to run at low energy @xmath39 tev where it is expected to collect a small luminosity @xmath40 pb@xmath41 .",
    "this energy will be upgraded to @xmath42 tev with an expected integrated luminosity of the order @xmath43 pb@xmath41 , before reaching the design energy of 14 tev . in figure",
    "[ fig : cs1 ] we have shown the production cross - sections of @xmath2 for the center of mass energy of 10 and 14 tev . depending on the energy , it can exceed a picobarn in part of the @xmath44 parameter space .",
    "the decay chains depend on the parameter region : as discussed in the previous section , in the region @xmath27 the t - odd leptons decay directly in the heavy photon , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath31 the t - odd leptons decay mainly via heavy charged @xmath29 s , as in eqns ( [ eq : decay - chain ] ) .",
    "these two regions of parameter space give different signatures , therefore we will discuss them separately in next sub - sections .      in this region the t - odd leptons decay with 100% branching ratio to the heavy photon and the corresponding sm lepton .",
    "the heavy neutrinos , therefore , decay invisibly : this gives rise to the signature of a single isolated charged lepton with missing energy ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the dominant sm background for this signature comes from the on- and off - shell @xmath36 production :    * on - shell @xmath36 production , @xmath48 . * off ",
    "shell @xmath36 production @xmath49 with the @xmath36 going to leptons and the @xmath50 decaying invisibly via @xmath51 .",
    "this signature has been already analysed in @xcite .",
    "they argued that it may be possible to reduce the backgrounds by using high @xmath52 cuts and by using the transverse mass cuts .",
    "the transverse mass is defined as follows : m_t =  , [ eq : mt1 ] where @xmath53 is the angle between the transverse momentum of the lepton @xmath54 and the transverse component of missing energy .    in order to perform the analysis we impose the following _ pre - selection cuts _ :    * jet veto : we reject events having any resolved jet . by resolved jet we mean a jet that is visible in the detector . for this",
    "we veto an event having a jet with @xmath55 gev and rapidity @xmath56 . *",
    "exactly one charged lepton with @xmath57 gev and @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath54 and @xmath58 distributions after the _ preselection cuts _ for signal events are given in fig [ fig : tlep1 ] .",
    ".__results of the simulations for the signal @xmath47 .",
    "the numbers of events , after sequentially imposing the cuts mentioned in the text , are for an lhc luminosity @xmath59 fb@xmath41 .",
    "the most efficient cut is @xmath60 gev , for which we also give @xmath61 for different lhc luminosities .",
    "note that a cut at the same level on @xmath58 is practically ineffective as the two quantities are strongly correlated .",
    "harder cuts , for example @xmath62 gev , start affecting more the signal events , therefore reducing @xmath61 .",
    "_ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of our simulations are summarized in table [ table:4 ] . as in the trilepton case ,",
    "the small statistics requires very large integrated luminosities in order to observe this channel , even though the backgrounds are easily controlled .",
    "in this work we have discussed the phenomenology of t - parity odd heavy leptons at the lhc in the littlest higgs model as a sample of the corresponding phenomenology for typical little higgs models with t - parity .",
    "this type of models predicts a set of new t - odd fermions in addition to the heavy gauge bosons of the little higgs model . we have studied t - odd charged lepton single and pair production at the lhc and their purely leptonic decays .",
    "production of a pair of heavy neutrinos , when giving visible leptonic signatures , have a too feeble rate to be detected .",
    "those channels are very clean at the lhc due to the absence of jets which can rid of most of the qcd background . in the single charged channel ,",
    "the production cross - sections at lhc are large and can be more than a picobarn in part of the @xmath44 parameter space . for @xmath27 the heavy leptons decay only to the heavy photon @xmath11 and the corresponding standard model lepton .",
    "this yields the single lepton signature @xmath47 , which can be discovered at lhc over the background with an integrated luminosity of around 10 fb@xmath41 both for the 10 tev and the 14 tev centre of mass energy options . when @xmath28 the production cross - sections are typically small due to the larger mass of the heavy leptons , and decay modes involving the heavy @xmath29 and @xmath30 bosons open up .",
    "for @xmath63 this gives rise to a trilepton signature , however it is suppressed by small branching ration and therefore a high integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath41 is necessary for the observation of such channel .",
    "the process @xmath64 has a smaller production cross - section which is typically in the @xmath65 femtobarn region , however it is easier to detect over the backgrounds due to the presence of two opposite charge leptons in the final state . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the dilepton plus missing energy ( @xmath67 ) signal can be easily detected at lhc over the background , and an integrated luminosity of 1 to 3 fb@xmath41 is sufficient for the discovery .    in summary , for small values of the yukawa coupling @xmath68 ,",
    "the t - odd heavy leptons of t - parity little higgs models are easily detectable at the lhc due to the purely leptonic signatures .",
    "this provides is a new handle to test this type of models with a few spectacular channels that can be studied even in the early stage of the lhc running , with clear and visible signatures over the background . for larger yukawa couplings ,",
    "the purely leptonic signal is suppressed by branching ratios , therefore requiring very large integrated luminosities for the detection . in this case ,",
    "semi - leptonic decays may be interesting , however we leave their study to future work .",
