    "narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies are considered to be a special class of  normal \" seyfert 1 galaxies because of their peculiar properties that distinguish them from the latter class .",
    "they are characterized by their optical spectra having permitted lines that are narrower than those found in the normal seyfert 1 galaxies , e.g. , full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of h@xmath9 line is @xmath11 , relatively weak forbidden lines , @xmath12\\lambda5007}{h\\beta}<3 $ ] ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) , and strong fe  ii emission .",
    "nls1 galaxies also have distinctive soft x - ray properties as well .",
    "they show steep soft x - ray spectrum with little or no absorption above the galactic value ( grupe et al .",
    "they often show rapid and large amplitude as well as long - term x - ray variability ( boller et al .",
    "1993 ; brandt , pounds , & fink 1995 ; grupe et al .  1995a , b ) .",
    "in spite of the dominance of soft x - ray emission , soft x - ray luminosity of nls1 galaxies are similar to those of normal seyfert 1s .",
    "@xmath13 observations show that the hard x - ray ( @xmath14 ) continua of nls1s are also steeper than those of normal seyfert 1s with broader h@xmath9 fwhm ( brandt , mathur , & elvis 1997 ; leighly 1999b ) .",
    "nls1 galaxies also show more variability in hard x - rays than the normal seyfert 1s ( leighly , 1999a ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from far - infrared ( fir ) to x - rays of nls1 galaxies appears to be similar to that of broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "however , the uv luminosity of nls1 galaxies tends to be smaller than those of seyfert 1s ( rodriguez - pascual , mas - hesse , & santos - lle 1997 ) .",
    "optical spectroscopy of ultra - soft x - ray sources discovered with @xmath15 , and @xmath2 has been an efficient way to identify nls1 galaxies ( e.g , puchnarewicz et al .",

    "1998 ) . as part of our programme to optically identify and study in detail the counterparts of the ultra - soft sources in the catalogue of singh et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we have discovered a nls1 galaxy rx  j1236.9 + 2656 .",

    "the region of the sky containing the source , rx  j1236.9 + 2656 , was observed seven times with the @xmath2 ( truemper et al .",
    "1983 ) position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) during 19911993 and twice with the high resolution imager ( hri ) ( pfeffermann et al . 1987 ) in 1996 june  july .",
    "the exposure times were in the range @xmath28 for the pspc observations while the two hri observations were carried out with longer exposure times ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "the offset of the source from the field center was @xmath31 for each of the pspc and hri observations .",
    "the x - ray source , rx  j1236.9 + 2656 , was identified by overlaying the contours of high resolution x - ray images obtained from @xmath2 hri observations onto optical images obtained from the digital sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "no other x - ray source , within the angular spread comparable to the point spread function of @xmath2 hri , was seen in the overlays .",
    "therefore , x - ray emission from rx  j1236.9 + 2656 is not contaminated by emission from any other source .",
    "hri count rates for rx  j1236.9 + 2656 were obtained using a circle of radius @xmath32 for the source and an annulus of inner circle radius @xmath33 and width @xmath33 for background .",
    "the hri count rates thus estimated are ( @xmath34 and ( @xmath35 for the two observations . the spatial resolution with the pspc at an offset of @xmath36 is @xmath37 ( half power radius ) ( hasinger et al .",
    "therefore , pspc count rates for rx  j1236.9 + 2656 were obtained using a circle of radius @xmath38 for the source and 7 nearby circular regions of radii @xmath39 for background .",
    "the pspc count rates are ( @xmath40 , ( @xmath41 , ( @xmath42 , ( @xmath43 , ( @xmath44 , ( @xmath45 , and ( @xmath46 for the 7 pspc observations .    in order to investigate the time variability of soft x - ray emission from rx  j1236.9 + 2656 , we extracted light curves from the @xmath2 pspc observations using the same source and the background regions as described above and in the pspc energy band of 0.12.4 kev containing all the x - ray photons .",
    "the background subtractions were carried out after appropriately scaling the background light curves to have the same area as the source extraction area .",
    "the light curves of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 do not show short - term variability during the pspc observations .",
    "however , on a longer time scale of months to years , variability is clearly detected in the x - ray flux measurements plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the observed flux in the energy band @xmath47 , estimated from the best fit spectral model ( see below ) , increased by about a factor of 2 within @xmath1 .",
    "for analyzing the x - ray spectra of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 , we choose 3 pspc spectra corresponding to those observations for which the exposure times were greater than @xmath48 .",
    "these observations were carried out on 1991 december 15 , 1992 june 30 , and 1993 june 17 . photon energy spectra of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 were accumulated from their pspc observations using the same source and background regions as stated above .",
    "@xmath2 pspc pulse height data were appropriately re - grouped to improve the statistics .",
    "we used the xspec spectral analysis package to fit the data with spectral models .",
    "appropriate ancillary response file was used to account for the off - axis position of the source .",
    "an appropriate response matrix was used to define the energy response of the pspc .",
    "each of the 3 pspc spectra was first fitted with a redshifted power - law model absorbed by an intervening medium with absorption cross - sections as given by balucinska - church and mccammon ( 1992 ) and using the method of @xmath49-minimization . the photon index ( @xmath50 )",
    "was found to be very steep in all the cases .",
    "it was found that the absorbing column density in each case is similar within errors to the galactic value ( @xmath51 ) measured from 21-cm radio observations ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) along the direction of the source , indicating that all the x - ray absorption is due to matter in our own galaxy .",
    "therefore , we have fitted the power - law models to these spectra after fixing the neutral hydrogen column density to the galactic value . the best - fit minimum @xmath52 and the power - law index",
    "do not change significantly from those obtained while varying the .",
    "the photon indices obtained for fixed are , however , better constrained .",
    "the values for @xmath50 are @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for the spectra observed on 1991 dec 15 , 1992 june 30 , and 1993 june 17 , respectively , and are quite similar within the errors for all three spectra .",
    "the errors quoted , here and below , were calculated at the @xmath56 confidence level based on @xmath57 + 2.71 . in order to better constrain the model parameters ,",
    "we have fitted the above model to the three spectra jointly .",
    "the best - fit photon index is now @xmath58 . the observed flux , based on the best - fit model parameters , is estimated to be @xmath59 in the energy band of @xmath6 . in the same energy band",
    "the intrinsic soft x - ray luminosity , corrected for galactic absorption , of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 is calculated to be @xmath60 .",
    "we have also analyzed all the 7 pspc spectra jointly .",
    "the best - fit phton index is @xmath61 which is similar to that obtained for the 3 pspc observations above .",
    "thus , it is clear that all available pspc spectral data of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 are well represented by a power - law of photon index @xmath62 absorbed by the matter in our own galaxy .",
    "we have also fitted redshifted blackbody models , absorbed by an intervening medium , to the three pspc spectra ( exposure times @xmath63 3000  s ) of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 taken jointly as well as all the 7 data taken jointly .",
    "the absorbing column density derived from the model fit was lower than the galactic value in that direction , indicating that the blackbody is not a suitable model .",
    "we then fixed the absorbing column to the galactic value and carried out the joint fitting .",
    "the temperature thus obtained , @xmath64 , reflects the ultra - soft nature of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath2 hri flux of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 using the best - fit model parameters obtained from best - fit to all the 7 spectral data ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) .",
    "the observed hri fluxes are @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the energy band of @xmath69 for the two hri observations .",
    "the hri fluxes are about a factor of two higher than the values obtained from the pspc observations .",
    "low resolution optical spectroscopic observations of rx j1236.9 + 2656 were carried out at the 3.5 m telescope of the apache point observatory ( apo ) on the nights of 1995 april 25 , 30 and 2000 january 6 .",
    "the integrations ranged from 4 - 15 min , with the best spectrum obtained during the last observation .",
    "the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) was used in low resolution mode with a @xmath70 slit to obtain simultaneous blue and red spectra covering @xmath71 in the blue and @xmath72 in the red with a resolution of 14 .",
    "the optical spectra were reduced using routines available within the iraf software .",
    "this included correcting the images using bias and flat fields , extracting sky - subtracted one - dimensional spectra and calibrating the wavelengths from henear lamps and the fluxes from standard stars . in the spectrum of rx",
    "j1236.9 + 2656 , strong emission lines of balmer h@xmath10 , h@xmath9 , and the forbidden line [ o iii]@xmath73 are readily observed . using the peak wavelengths and the rest wavelengths of these lines ,",
    "a redshift of 0.225@xmath74 was derived from the 2000 january spectrum .",
    "the observed spectrum was then corrected for this redshift and is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum is @xmath75 measured from the dispersion in the continuum region @xmath76 .",
    "the continuum is observed to rise towards the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "apart from the emission lines mentioned above , we have also identified fe  ii emission between @xmath77 and a forbidden line of [ fe vii]@xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "we have fitted gaussian profiles to the strong emission lines using the profile fitting feature in the ` splot ' task within iraf . due to the poor resolution of the spectrum , it was not possible to deblend the h@xmath10 , and [ n ii]@xmath79 lines .",
    "a single gaussian profile is not well fitted to the core of the h@xmath10 line and the fwhm is overestimated because of the presence of [ n ii]@xmath79 lines .",
    "we also fitted a single gaussian to the h@xmath10 after excluding the wings . in this case , the fwhm can be considered as a lower limit .",
    "thus we derive the fwhm of the h@xmath10 line to be in the range of @xmath80 .",
    "the widths have been corrected for instrumental broadening by subtracting , in quadrature , the instrumental broadening ( fwhm = @xmath81 ) from the observed fwhm .",
    "the h@xmath10+[n ii ] flux is estimated to be @xmath82 by integrating the flux over the h@xmath10+[n ii ] profile .",
    "the profile of the balmer line h@xmath9 is well fitted by a lorentzian profile but poorly fitted with a gaussian .",
    "the fwhms of the best - fit lorentzian and gaussian profiles to the h@xmath9 line are @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the observed widths of h@xmath10 and h@xmath9 , and the presence of fe  ii , [ fe  vii ] emission are characteristic of nls1 galaxies .",
    "the flux of the h@xmath9 line is estimated to be @xmath85 .",
    "similarly the flux of the [ o iii]@xmath73 line is calculated to be @xmath86 .",
    "thus the ratio , @xmath12\\lambda5007}{h\\beta}$ ] is only @xmath87 .",
    "rx  j1236.9 + 2656 is luminous in soft x - rays , with a rest frame intrinsic luminosity @xmath88 , in the energy band of 0.12.0  kev .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies studied by rush et al .",
    "( 1996 ) span over 4 orders of magnitude in soft x - ray luminosity , from below @xmath89 to above @xmath90 in the energy band of 0.12.4  kev .",
    "thus , the x - ray luminosity of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 is similar to that of a seyfert 1 galaxy . assuming that the soft x - ray luminosity of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 is about @xmath91 of the bolometric luminosity , the lower limit to the mass of the central supermassive object or the eddington mass is @xmath92 .",
    "the galaxy rx  j1236.9 + 2656 shows long - term variability  a change in intensity by a factor of @xmath0 within @xmath1 , another characteristic of nls1 galaxies .",
    "short - term ( @xmath93 ) variability is not detected from rx  j1236.9 + 2656 due to poor signal - to - noise ratio of the @xmath2 data .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 is steeper ( @xmath94 ) than those of normal seyfert 1s [ @xmath95 ( @xmath56 range)@xmath96 , and similar to those of nls1 galaxies [ @xmath97 ( grupe et al .",
    "lack of intrinsic soft x - ray absorption over the galactic value in rx  j1236.9 + 2656 is similar to the results found in normal seyfert 1s and nls1 galaxies .",
    "the steeper power - law index and blackbody model fit to the pspc spectra of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 indicate an ultra - soft nature of this object .",
    "the derived temperature of the blackbody , @xmath98 , is similar to those found in nls1 galaxies ( brandt & boller 1998 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 appears to be typical of nls1 galaxies .",
    "the fwhm of the h@xmath9 line ( in the range of 11221392  km  s@xmath99 ) is narrower than those found in normal seyfert 1s and is similar to those found in nls1 galaxies ( fwhm@xmath100 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath12\\lambda5007}{h\\beta}$ ] ( @xmath87 ) for rx  j1236.9 + 2656 indicates that forbidden lines are weak , similar to that observed from nls1 galaxies ( @xmath12\\lambda5007}{h\\beta}<3.0 $ ] ) .",
    "an fe  ii multiplet between @xmath77 is also detected from rx  j1236.9 + 2656 . at blue wavelengths ,",
    "there is an indication of the presence of an fe  ii multiplet between @xmath101 although our observation did not cover the multiplet fully .",
    "thus the optical emission line parameters strongly suggest that rx  j1236.9 + 2656 is a nls1 galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the position of rx  j1236.9 + 2656 on the @xmath50h@xmath9 line width plane ( fig . 8 of boller et al .",
    "1996 ) is consistent with other nls1 galaxies .",
