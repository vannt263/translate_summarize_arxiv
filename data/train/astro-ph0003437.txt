    "it has been recognized , already a few years ago , that a self  consistent agn model for the xrb requires the combined fit of several observational constraints in addition to the xrb spectral intensity such as the number counts , the redshift and absorption distribution in different energy ranges , the average spectra and so on ( setti & woltjer 1989 ) .",
    "first attempts towards a ",
    "best fit \" solution relied on simplified assumptions for the agn spectral properties and for the evolution of their luminosity function ( madau , ghisellini & fabian 1994 ( mgf94 ) , comastri et al .",
    "1995 ( cszh95 ) , celotti et al .",
    "1995 ( cfgm95 ) ) .",
    "a three step approach has been followed to build the so  called baseline model : the first step is to assume a single average spectrum for the type 1 objects which is usually parameterized as a power law plus a reflection component from a face  on disk and a high  energy cut ",
    "off at a few hundreds of kev . a distribution of absorbing column densities for type 2 objects is then added in the second step .",
    "finally the template spectra are folded with an evolving xlf which , in the framework of unified models , does not depend on the amount of intrinsic obscuration .",
    "the number density and absorption distribution of obscured sources are then varied until a good fit is obtained .",
    "the baseline model led to a successful description of most of the observational data available before 1995 and to testable predictions for the average properties of the sources responsible for the bulk of the xrb .",
    "the increasing amount of data from soft and hard x  ray surveys combined with the study of nearby bright sources has been used to obtain a more detailed description of the agn x  ray spectra and absorption distribution .",
    "in addition , the optical identification of sizeable samples of faint agns discovered in the rosat , asca and bepposax surveys has shed new light on the evolution of the agn luminosity function opening the possibility to test in more detail the agn synthesis model predictions . as a consequence ,",
    "the modelling of the xrb has attracted renewed attention and several variations / improvements with respect to the baseline model have been proposed . however , despite the increasing efforts , a coherent self ",
    "consistent picture of  the \" xrb model has yet to be reached , as most of its ingredients have to be extrapolated well beyond the present limits . besides the interest in a best  fit model it is by now clear that the problem of the origin of the xrb is closely related to the evolution of accretion and obscuration in agn . as a consequence , the xrb spectrum should be considered as a useful tool towards a better understanding of the history of black hole formation and evolution in the universe ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) and the interplay between agn activity and star  formation ( franceschini et al .",
    "1999 ; fabian this volume ) .",
    "the low energy ( below 10 kev ) xrb spectrum has been measured with the imaging detectors onboard rosat , asca , and bepposax and a summary of the results is given in figure 1 together with a compilation of recent re  analysis of the heao1 a2 and a4 experiments data .",
    "the comparison between the different datasets in the overlapping @xmath0 18 kev energy range points to a systematic difference in the normalization of the xrb flux while the average spectrum is similar among all the observations .",
    "the largest deviation is of the order of @xmath0 40 % between the heao1 a2 and bepposax data ( see vecchi et al .",
    "1999 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "such a discrepancy could be due to residual , not fully understood , cross  calibration errors among the different detectors and/or to field  to  field fluctuations .",
    "these findings cast shadows on the intensity and the location of the xrb peak as measured by heao1 a2 ( @xmath0 43 kev @xmath1 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 at 30 kev ; gruber et al .",
    "indeed a simple extrapolation of the bepposax and heao1 a4 med best fit spectra imply that the xrb spectrum peaks at @xmath0 23 kev with a much higher intensity introducing an extra  degree of freedom in agn models parameter space . a new measurement of the 10100 kev spectrum would be extremely important .",
    "unfortunately such observations are not foreseen in the near future .",
    "as far as the model of the xrb is concerned , the most important parameters to deal with are a good estimate of the average continuum slope and of the absorption column density .",
    "the broad  band energy range exploited by bepposax turned out to be extremely useful to probe column densities as high as 10@xmath3 @xmath1 , to assess the strength of the reflection component which peaks around 2030 kev , and the shape of the low  energy soft  excess emission below @xmath0 1 kev .",
    "in addition asca observations of sizeable samples of relatively faint agns have allowed to probe the spectral properties of high  luminosity high ",
    "redshift objects .",
    "the most important new results emerging from these observations can be summarized as follows :    -1 cm    @xmath4 the fraction of heavily obscured ( 24 @xmath5 log @xmath6 @xmath5 25 ) and compton thick ( log @xmath7 25 ) sources in the local universe is much higher than previously thought ( risaliti , maiolino & salvati 1999 ) and a fraction as high as 50% of the seyfert 2 in the local universe could be obscured by these large column densities .",
    "@xmath4 soft excess emission is uncommon among bright seyfert 1 galaxies ( matt this volume ) and nearby quasars ( george et al .",
    "2000 ) and estimated to be present in less than @xmath0 30 % of agn .",
    "@xmath4 first observations of high redshift quasars suggest a flattening of the power law slope which can not be ascribed to the reflection component ( vignali et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "@xmath4 despite intensive searches for high luminosity highly absorbed objects ( the so  called type 2 quasars ) these sources appear to be elusive and only a few bona  fide examples have been reported in the literature ( i.e. barcons et al .",
    "1998 ; georgantopoulos et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the evolution of the agn xlf has been extensively studied mainly in the soft x ",
    "rays and usually parametrized with a pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model ( i.e. boyle et al 1994 ) . a major step forward in the determination of the soft xlf has been recently achieved by miyaji et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . combining the results of several rosat surveys it has been possible to explore the low - luminosity high - redshift tail of the xlf in much greater detail than before .",
    "the results favour a luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) as the best description of the available data . in agreement with previous studies ,",
    "x - ray selected agn undergo strong evolution up to a redshift @xmath8 = 1.52.0 and a levelling  off or a weak negative evolution up to @xmath9 45 .",
    "two parametric descriptions ( ldde1 and ldde2 ) encompassing the statistically acceptable fits to the soft xlf have been worked out by miyaji and collaborators .",
    "the integration of the ldde1 and ldde2 xlf up to @xmath10 5 accounts for about 60 % and 90 % of the soft xrb respectively .",
    "before discussing and comparing the various models , it is important to stress the strong coupling between the input spectral parameters and those describing the xlf evolution , which instead are often uncorrectly considered to be independent in the models . indeed",
    "the x  ray luminosities are usually computed converting count rates into fluxes assuming a single valued ( relatively steep ) slope .",
    "this procedure might easily lead to a wrong estimate of the intrinsic luminosity for a very hard absorbed spectrum or if the soft x  ray flux is due to a component not directly related to the obscured nucleus ( as in the case of a thermal spectrum from a starburst or scattered emission ) . according with the xrb baseline model ,",
    "absorbed agn become progressively more important towards faint fluxes and thus an additional spurious density evolution term can be introduced in the derivation of the xlf .",
    "it turns out that not only the evolution and the space density of obscured agn are highly uncertain , but also the common practice to consider the soft xlf as representative of the properties of type 1 objects is likely to contain major uncertainties especially when extrapolated to higher energies .",
    "unfortunately our present knowledge of the agn spectral and evolutive properties does not allow to disentangle the spectral and evolutionary parameters , leaving this ambiguity in all the xrb synthesis models .",
    "the baseline model ( cfr @xmath11 1 ) has been recently extended , taking into account some of the new observational findings described in @xmath112 , by several authors : gilli , risaliti & salvati 1999 ( grs99 ) ; miyaji , hasinger & schmidt 1999 ( mhs99 ) ; wilman & fabian 1999 ( wf99 ) ; pompilio , la franca & matt 2000 ( plm00 ) .",
    "a good agreement among the various models has been reached on the high energy cut  off in the input spectrum ( 300500 kev ) , which is basically fixed by the xrb shape above 40 kev ( comastri 1999 ) , and on the @xmath8 and @xmath12 values .",
    "grs99 and mhs99 adopted the ldde model for the evolution of the xlf and also introduced a cut  off in the luminosity distribution of absorbed agn for @xmath13 10@xmath14 erg s@xmath2 to cope with the lack of type 2 qso .",
    "the absorption distribution has been fixed according to the recent bepposax results only in the grs99 model . plm00 and wf99 both stressed that a proper treatement of the high energy spectrum of heavily obscured ( 24 @xmath5 log@xmath6 @xmath5 25 ) objects has important consequences for the modelling .",
    "in particular the evolution of the obscured to unobscured ratio as a function of redshift ( plm00 ) or the need of super  solar abundances to better fit the xrb peak at 30 kev ( wf99 ; but see @xmath11 2.1 ) have been invoked .         the expected contribution of agn to the 210 kev xrb",
    "is reported in table 2 as a function of flux .",
    "the model parameters are such to account for an intensity of @xmath0 7 @xmath15 10@xmath16 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 ( in between the asca and bepposax measurements ) at @xmath0 10@xmath17 cgs .",
    "the predictions are model dependent and should be considered as indicative .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that at the fluxes sampled by the foreseen chandra and xmm medium ",
    "deep surveys most of the xrb will be resolved allowing to unveil the nature of the sources making the bulk of its energy density .",
    "the most important challenge for xrb models will be the study of x  ray absorption and luminosity distribution for 210 kev fluxes @xmath5 10@xmath18 cgs , the search for heavily obscured agn which according to the predictions are expected to show up in a substantial fraction below @xmath5 10@xmath19 cgs ( cfr . fig .",
    "3 ) , and the optical  infrared follow  up of x  ray obscured sources ."
