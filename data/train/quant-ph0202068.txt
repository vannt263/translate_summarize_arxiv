    "a promising avenue of research in the attempt to build quantum computers uses large optical nonlinearities to create essential elements for quantum computation , such as quantum gates  @xcite . obtaining large ,",
    "noiseless nonlinearities is of course a fundamental goal in the field of nonlinear optics , and technological advances in recent years , for example in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed )  @xcite and the ability to access and study strongly coupled quantum systems , offer an exciting new era in this field .",
    "attempts to achieve large optical nonlinearities are generally plagued by a seemingly necessary trade - off between large absorption and the strength of nonlinearity : to obtain a strong nonlinearity one has to drive the atomic system close to resonance , triggering large absorption and therefore a strong source of noise .",
    "however , it is possible to reduce atomic absorption ( and hence spontaneous emission ) by utilizing quantum coherence effects in multilevel atoms .",
    "in particular , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite was employed by schmidt and imamolu  @xcite to devise a scheme involving four  level atoms which produces a large kerr nonlinearity with virtually no noise .",
    "it was then shown by imamolu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that if such a strong optical kerr nonlinearity is implemented in a cqed setting , then it is possible to realize the effect of _ photon blockade _ , in which the atom  cavity system effectively acts as a turnstile device for single photons .",
    "the physical explanation of this effect is simple .",
    "only the transition between the ground and first excited state of the nonlinear atom  cavity system is resonant with the driving field .",
    "higher states are detuned from resonance by an amount proportional to the strength of nonlinearity .",
    "tian and carmichael  @xcite have also predicted such an effect with a single two - level atom strongly coupled to the cavity mode .",
    "the proposal of schmidt and imamolu  @xcite , although very appealing in its use of eit to reduce decoherence , meets obstacles in the attempt for implementation in the many - atom cqed environment .",
    "it was shown that this particular realization of the photon blockade system is not ideal for demonstrating photon blockade , because of the strong linear dispersion of the medium  @xcite . in an attempt to avoid this difficulty , rebi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a model in which a single four  level atom is trapped in a high  finesse microcavity .",
    "it was shown that this system ( called the single - atom eit - kerr system ) can act as a near - ideal kerr optical nonlinearity .",
    "in such a strongly coupled system , the excitations can be labeled as polaritons , which are defined as mixtures of atom / cavity mode excitations . for weak to moderate",
    "driving , the eit ",
    "kerr system can be approximated by a two - state system , corresponding to the two lowest lying polariton eigenstates .",
    "the transitions to the next set of excited states ( the second manifold ) , obtained by introducing a second photon from the driving field into the cavity , are highly detuned from the bare  cavity resonance , and therefore can not be excited .",
    "hence , in effect , the weakly driven single  atom eit  kerr system acts as an ideal photon blockade device .    in a further work",
    "@xcite , a hamiltonian for the effective two - level system was derived using a polariton basis , and it was shown that such a hamiltonian can describe the spectral properties and energy splittings ( dynamic stark effect ) seen in the full model . furthermore , to explain the properties of the second order correlation function",
    ", it was shown that the effective two - level system has to be generalized to include two extra states in the first excitation manifold  @xcite .",
    "if more than one atom is introduced the situation becomes more complicated , since each additional atom introduces extra energy levels into the second manifold , some of which are connected to the lower levels via transitions which are resonant with the cavity mode .",
    "however , it was shown by werner and imamolu  @xcite that the introduction of an additional atomic detuning can be used to solve this problem ( see also the work of greentree _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    in  @xcite , a comparison of the eit ",
    "kerr scheme and the extended jaynes  cummings scheme ( i.e. the standard jaynes - cummings model  @xcite with the effects of losses included ) was made in terms of their effectiveness in producing photon blockade .",
    "kerr scheme exhibited a value of @xmath0 ( the second order correlation function at zero time delay ) of @xmath1 that of the corresponding jaynes ",
    "cummings scheme .",
    "this was attributed to destructive quantum interference between certain transition amplitudes . in particular , with a suitable choice of parameters , probability amplitudes for transitions from the first excited state ( in the first manifold ) to the two second manifold eigenstates closest to the cavity resonance",

    "this leads to enhanced antibunching of the photons leaving the cavity so that @xmath2 .",
    "we have remarked that the validity of these results depends on the assumption of weak driving .",
    "it is therefore of interest to explore how robust the photon blockade is as the driving field strength is increased .",

    ", it is the increasing ratio @xmath59 that really matters",
    ". the sharper transitions also occur at smaller values of @xmath56 . for a decreasing ratio @xmath59",
    ", @xmath0 approaches the behaviour of the extended jc model .",
    "we proceed to determine which eigenstates of the strongly coupled quantum system contribute significantly to its dynamics .",
    "the total density matrix of the system in the steady state can be written in most general terms as @xmath60 where @xmath8 , @xmath61 belong to the set of all possible states of the system in an arbitrary basis . the natural basis for the simulation is the one of bare states .",
    "the cavity mode subspace is truncated at 40 , making the size of @xmath62 equal to @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the transformation that diagonalizes hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , i.e. the full hamiltonian , with driving included .",
    "the density matrix can be transformed into a new basis as @xmath64 , and we can look for the nonzero elements of this matrix .",
    "diagonal elements of the matrix correspond to populations of the dressed states , while off - diagonal elements correspond to coherences between the dressed states .",
    "the results depend on the size of @xmath65 , i.e. we expect the number of non  zero elements to increase as @xmath65 is increased . for a large part of the @xmath65 range considered , however , the density matrix is dominated by elements corresponding to two particular states .",
    "figure  [ fig : denmat ] shows the nonzero matrix elements of density matrix @xmath66 .",
    "diagonal states are sorted in increasing order ; the state with largest negative detuning is at @xmath67 , while the state with largest positive detuning is at @xmath68 .",
    "states with the smallest detuning ( i.e. closest to the cavity resonance ) are at the centre of matrix , at positions 80 and 81 along the main diagonal .",
    "two diagonal elements dominate the matrix , and we identify these as being the populations of the stark - split states @xmath69 ( see appendix  [ sec : stark ] and  @xcite ) .",
    "stark - split states are therefore found at the positions 80 and 81 on the main diagonal of the density matrix . at positions 79 and 82",
    "are the two states from the second manifold ( two - photon excitations ) , closest to the resonance . at the positions 78 and 83",
    "are two remaining states from the first manifold ; at the positions 77 and 84 are two states from the third manifold ( three - photon excitations ) , closest to the resonance , and so on .",
    "the states we have just identified suffice to indicate the dynamics of the system .",
    "off - diagonal elements are coherences between the appropriate dressed states .    one striking feature can be noted immediately from fig .",
    "[ fig : denmat ] .",
    "namely , the first ` square ' of elements ( 4 elements on each side ) encircling the centre square ( stark states , @xmath70 ) remains much smaller than all of the other accessible states . in terms of dressed states , this means that the second manifold states remain unpopulated and the coherences between these and all the other states vanish as well .",
    "furthermore , as the driving increases , the states whose coherences with the stark states increase to a noticeable size are the third manifold states ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : denmat ] for @xmath71 ) .",
    "as the driving increases further , the remaining two first manifold states ( their populations and coherences with the stark states ) also start to contribute .",
    "so , contrary to expectations , the contribution to the dynamics of the states beyond the effective two - level system do not increase according to the smallness of their detunings from the bare cavity frequency .",
    "the two least ",
    "detuned second - manifold states are in fact essentially unpopulated .    from the above analysis of the density matrix elements",
    ", we can deduce the solution to the ` photon statistics puzzle ' of figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the strong photon antibunching at small @xmath17 is the consequence of the effective two - level system , and has been well understood .",
    "the sharp rise in @xmath0 with increasing @xmath17 can be attributed to the two - photon transitions needed to populate the third manifold states from the first manifold , and then decay back in cascade to the first manifold .",
    "these two - photon decays cause the sharp increase in the second order output field correlations .",
    "but , what causes the system to skip second manifold states ?",
    "again , the answer can be deduced from the density matrix .",
    "strong coherence between the first and third manifold states , together with the missing population in the second manifold states ( and vanishing coherences associated with these states ) uncovers the effect of eit - type quantum interference between the dressed states .",
    "this is not surprising , since the quantum interference between the transitions from first to second manifold have been already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these features are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : popcoh ] , where the relevant populations and coherences are shown . note that the combined population of the two inner second manifold states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : popcoh ] @xmath23 , solid line ) vanishes for a large interval of driving , since the value of @xmath72 is at the numerical precision value , and fluctuations are numerical , not physical in nature .",
    "these populations become nonzero at the value of driving strength at which @xmath0 of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( solid line ) peaks .",
    "these plots further justify the discussion of the preceeding paragraphs .",
    "we proceed with the development of an effective model with relatively few levels which nevertheless captures most of the important features of the dynamics .",
    "in the formulation of an effective model , we rely on the formalism developed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this formalism was very successful in the development of an effective two - level theory , and in explaining the fluorescence spectrum .",
    "now we extend the model and include a total of six dressed states in the effective model .",

    "[ fig : eff6 ]",
    ".    it should be noted , however , that the dressed states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff6 ] do not correspond exactly to the dressed states discussed in section  [ sec : densmat ] .",

    "both @xmath125 and @xmath126 are determined by the correlations in the intensity , so the departure from the coherent value of the correlation function can be assigned to the effects of squeezing and the effects of intensity correlations .     from the incoherent component of the intracavity field .",

    "the contributions from the incoherent component of the intracavity field are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : incoh ] . the squeezing and intensity correlation parts are shown separately .",
    "the antibunching for weak fields comes from the squeezed fluctuations , which reduce the contribution from the coherent scattering . as the driving increases , the squeezing decreases , but the variance in intensity fluctuations becomes negative , so the remaining antibunching comes from the sub - poissonian intensity fluctuations in the incoherent component of the field . for @xmath127 ,",
    "the squeezing contribution effectively vanishes , while @xmath20 and @xmath123 become positive , and antibunching disappears .",
    "strong bunching clearly originates in the super - poissonian intensity correlations , and the correlation function is dominated by @xmath123 .",
    "the presence of nonclassical effects in a driven atom - cavity system is a topic that has received much attention for many years .",
    "the system usually studied has been the canonical system of quantum optics  a single two - level atom confined in an optical cavity .",

    ", clemens and rice pay special attention to nonclassical effects known as ` undershoots ' and ` overshoots ' .",
    "these are related to the violation of inequalities that hold for classical correlations , in particular violations that occur not in the value of @xmath45 , but for certain time delays @xmath128 .",
    "the explanation for the undershoots has been given by carmichael _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in terms of quantum interference of probability amplitudes and collapse of the wavefunction .",
    "the requirements for the classicality of the field correlations can be derived from the cauchy - schwartz inequality ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , and expressed in terms of the second - order correlation function as @xmath129 values in excess of those allowed classically are called overshoots , while values below are called undershoots .",
    "overshoots have been observed recently by mielke _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    in this context , it is of interest to see if the overshoots and/or undershoots can be found in the single - atom eit - kerr system under consideration .",
    "photon antibunching , as an example of nonclassical photon statistics , has already been predicted  @xcite , and the effective two - level behaviour analyzed  @xcite . in the present article , we have shown how the effects of self - homodyning of squeezed dipole radiation yields photon antibunching in the low to moderate driving limit .",
    "we have also shown that quantum interference between the probability amplitudes contributes to both strong antibunching and strong bunching , for weak and strong driving fields , respectively . given this range of behaviours , we might therefore expect undershoots and overshoots to also occur in the single - atom eit - kerr system under suitable conditions .",

    "the interesting region is for those values of driving for which @xmath0 increases through 1 , the value for a coherent field .",
    "this is also the region in which the dynamics is well - described in terms of quantum interference and increased incidence of two - photon emissions .    ) . ]    not surprisingly , this is also the range of parameters where largest violations of the classical inequalities occur . since the increase in the value of @xmath0 is due to the purely quantum effect of interference between probability amplitudes , non - classical behaviour of the correlations",
    "can be expected .",
    "the explanation of these effects given by rice and carmichael  @xcite and carmichael _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , although in a different context , still holds . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : incoh ] , self - homodyning of squeezed dipole radiation with the driving field occurs in the eit - kerr system in a similar manner to that for a two - level atom .",
    "an alternative explanation in terms of quantum interference of the driving field with the atomic polarization after the collapse of the wave function upon a photon detection event offers even more insight .",
    "this is best understood in the context of quantum trajectory theory .    .",
    "]    this explanation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : traject ] , where single trajectory realizations for the intracavity field and photon number are plotted .",
    "we see that the collapses tend to occur in succession before the system returns to a ( quasi- ) steady state ( which for this region of parameters happens after time @xmath130 ) .",
    "once it returns into a steady state , a few rabi cycles pass before the next set of collapses occur .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is determined by the ratio of the number of jumps upwards to number of jumps downwards in photon number , where jump upwards suggests that the detection of a photon increases the probability of detecting a second photon immediately afterwards .",
    "naturally , at the value of driving where @xmath0 peaks ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) , collapses are almost exclusively upwards , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : addtraject ] . undershoots appear as the consequence of a change in sign that the amplitude undergoes at the collapse  @xcite .",
    "as the system returns towards its steady state the polarization becomes close in magnitude and opposite in sign to the driving field , producing a near - zero mean intracavity field , leading to the reduced detection probability for a second photon .    .",
    "]    the overshoots can also be explained in terms of the collapses of the wave function .",
    "the detection of the first photon , emitted from the steady state situation , collapses the wave function of the system .",
    "the subsequent time evolution as the system returns to the steady state determines the photon correlations . for weak driving field ,",
    "the probability for the second collapse to occur before the system returns to the steady state is extremely small , since it is proportional to the mean intracavity photon number . for stronger driving fields the probability for subsequent collapses increases , specifically due to the large correlations between first and third manifold states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : popcoh ] .",
    "therefore , the probability for a second photon detection after some time @xmath131 increases as well , causing the correlation function overshoot . in experiment ,",
    "such event pairs are the source of delayed coincidence counts .",
    "a third collapse is also likely to occur before the steady state is reached .",
    "however , the overshoot disappears ( or significantly decreases ) for all time delays @xmath132 after the first peak .",
    "this is expected , since the exact form of the wave function after the second collapse depends on the delay time between the second and third photon .",
    "averaging over all possible realizations washes out the nonclassical effects due to different possible evolutions following the second collapse .",
    "a stronger driving field causes more subsequent collapses to occur , and nonclassical correlations are completely washed out .",
    "we find that overshoots and undershoots vanish at driving strength @xmath133 .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the properties of the photon statistics of light emitted by a single atom intracavity eit - kerr system .",
    "it was found that the statistics change abruptly as the driving field strength increases .",
    "specifically , strong photon antibunching , dominant in the weak to moderate driving regimes , is replaced by a strong photon bunching in the output field for the stronger driving .",
    "we have identified the effect of quantum interference between the dressed states to be responsible for this sudden change , and presented an effective model explaining qualitative features of this behaviour .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed contributions from the incoherent scattering to the system dynamics and found that the strong photon antibunching can be explained in terms of the self - homodyning of the incoherent intracavity component with the coherent component for weak driving , and in terms of reduced intensity fluctuations for moderate driving strengths .",
    "strong bunching is the signature of super - poissonian intensity fluctuations",
    ".    finally , nonclassical behaviour of the correlation function was found , and the effects of undershoots and overshoots analyzed .",

    "in this appendix , we briefly review the effect of dynamic stark splitting of dressed states , fully elaborated upon in ref .  @xcite .",
    "dressed states of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h0 ] ) contain , among others , two states on exact cavity resonance , separated by energy @xmath134 .",
