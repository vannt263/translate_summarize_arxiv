    "the primary motivation for a next generation @xmath3 linear collider is the study of collisions at centre of mass energies beyond 200gev .",
    "however , by adding an auxiliary positron source , it may be possible to run with high luminosity ( @xmath4 ) and polarised beams at the peak of the  resonance @xcite . this luminosity would allow the accumulation of @xmath5 hadronic  decays in about 70 days running , opening up the possibility to repeat the electroweak measurements currently performed at lep and sld with much higher precision .",
    "a sample of @xmath5  decays represents a gain of about 100 over the lep1 data sample .",
    "however , with the beam polarisation and good b - tagging capability at a linear collider , the more relevant comparison is with sld , where the gain will be more like a factor of 2000 . with beam polarisation , the variable that is most sensitive to the effective weak mixing angle @xmath6 is @xmath0 , the left - right asymmetry in  decays . using @xmath0 , sld at slac",
    "was able to measure the weak mixing angle to a better accuracy than any single observable at lep with less than a tenth of the luminosity @xcite .",
    "although the present sld analysis technique is limited by the precision of the electron polarisation measurement , the availability of positron polarisation at a linear collider allows the polarisation to be measured from cross section asymmetries . using a scheme first proposed by a.  blondel for lep @xcite , external measurements",
    "are then only needed for polarisation differences .",
    "this large data sample would also contain about @xmath7 b hadrons , a large enough sample to study rare cp - violating b decays .",
    "the linear collider offers a number of advantages over other facilities : the beam polarisation allows a very good initial state tag from the b - quark forward - backward asymmetry , the data sample is larger than that from asymmetric @xmath8 b factories , whilst the environment is much cleaner than that at hadron colliders .",
    "competitive measurements of the angles of the ckm unitarity triangle may thus be possible .",
    "the precision attainable on such electroweak and cp - violation measurements is studied in this paper .",
    "the basic assumptions used are described in section  [ s : setup ] , followed by discussions of the lineshape parameters in section  [ s : lines ] and  in section  [ s : rb ] .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 , including the blondel scheme for the polarisation determination , is described in detail in section  [ s : alr ] , followed by @xmath1 in section  [ s : ab ] .",
    "the potential for measurement of the ckm unitarity triangle angles",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is investigated in detail in section  [ s : cp ] . finally , the conclusions are given in section  [ s : conc ] .",
    "the tesla linear collider should be able to deliver a luminosity of @xmath13 at the -pole with the aid of an auxiliary positron source @xcite . with this luminosity , the sample of @xmath5 hadronic  ( corresponding to @xmath14 ) assumed in this paper can be produced in about 70 days running  a small cost to the overall physics program of the collider .",
    "the detector , trigger and data acquisition must of course be able to cope with the trigger rate of 200hz from hadronic  decays .",
    "it will be assumed that the electron and positron beams can be polarised with polarisations of @xmath15% and @xmath16% .",
    "this corresponds to an equivalent polarisation of @xmath17 .",
    "additionally , the polarisation should be switchable randomly from train to train .",
    "the energies of both the electron and positron beams can be measured with a spectrometer similar to the one currently being installed in lep @xcite .",
    "fast energy scans should be possible , so that the spectrometer can be calibrated relative to @xmath18 from lep . with this scheme a precision of 1mev",
    "might be reached .",
    "it should be noted that the relevant parameter to correct the electroweak measurements is the difference @xmath19 , so that the error on @xmath18 does not enter when the spectrometer is calibrated relative to the  mass .",
    "the parameters that are measured at lep in the scan around the resonance are :    * the mass of the  @xmath20 * the width of the  @xmath21 * the hadronic peak cross section @xmath22 * the ratio of the hadronic and leptonic partial widths @xmath23    since @xmath18 is used to calibrate the spectrometer , its precision clearly can not be improved at tesla . with the large  data sample ,",
    "the error on @xmath24 is equal to the error on @xmath25 , so 1mev is within reach .",
    "the error on the hadronic peak cross section is dominated by uncertainties coming from the luminosity measurement , mainly from theory .",
    "it is possible that with the high luminosity available at tesla , processes with low cross section but small uncertainties like @xmath26 can be used , but here it will be assumed that no improvement on @xmath27 will be possible .",
    "the partial width ratio @xmath28 receives substantial contributions from systematic uncertainties due to the leptonic and hadronic event selection .",
    "the uncertainties from the leptonic event selection , especially for muons , are mainly of a statistical nature , so can be assumed to scale with the luminosity .",
    "the uncertainty on the hadronic event selection will be assumed to stay at the best value reached at lep ( 0.05% ) .",
    "a more careful study on this subject is in progress @xcite .",
    "the interesting physics parameters that can be derived from the lineshape parameters are    * the mass of the  @xmath20 * the strong coupling constant at the -mass @xmath29 * the radiative correction parameter normalising the strength of the -couplings to the fermions @xmath30 * the number of light neutrino species @xmath31    the possible improvements in these parameters are summarised in table [ tab : line ] .",
    "it can be seen that an interesting gain can be obtained for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is completely determined by @xmath27 , so no change is expected if the luminosity determination can not be improved .",
    ".possible improvements in the physics quantities derived from the -lineshape after high luminosity -running at tesla . for @xmath35 and @xmath36 is assumed . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the expected invariant mass spectra for @xmath37 and @xmath38 are shown in figure  [ f : b0pi0bg](c ) and  ( d ) .",
    "the background histograms are extrapolations from the small number of surviving  events , so their shapes are somewhat uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that a good understanding of the background shape will be necessary to measure the signal branching ratios , and this may be rather difficult to achieve .    in summary , the measurement of the branching ratios @xmath39 and @xmath40 would be an important contribution to the understanding of cp violation in b decays , since it can not be performed at hadron colliders . however , it looks rather difficult with the present detector and uncertainties in the level of background . to proceed",
    "further probably requires a more realistic calorimeter simulation and a more detailed study of the @xmath41 reconstruction and background rejection .",
    "the study of time dependent asymmetries in  decays provides a method of determining the ckm angle @xmath11 and the small angle @xmath12 ( which is the ` tilt ' of the second unitarity triangle formed from the relation @xmath45 ) .",
    "mesons are not produced at all in @xmath46 decays ( so are inaccessible to @xmath8 b factories unless they run at a higher resonance ) and are only produced in 10% of b decays at higher energies .",
    "the  mixing frequency  is also at least 25 times higher than that for  mesons , so requiring very good time resolution to see the oscillations and asymmetries . both of these factors make studies of  decays much more challenging experimentally than studies of decays .",
    "searches for  oscillations at lep , sld and the tevatron have so far been carried out mainly using semi - inclusive modes such as @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in these analyses ,",
    "the energy of the  ( which is necessary to calculate the decay proper time ) is estimated using reconstructed and missing energy .",
    "however , the limit on  is now @xmath51 @xcite , and measuring significantly higher frequencies can only be done with rare fully reconstructed decays .",
    "the decay chain @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , @xmath54 provides a suitable decay mode to measure or set a limit on , whilst the similar @xmath55 provides a way of measuring @xmath56 .",
    "these channels have been studied using the full geant simulation brahms .",
    "the decay chain was fully reconstructed , requiring two oppositely charged tracks to make a @xmath57 candidate with @xmath58gev , combined with another track to make a  candidate with @xmath59gev and a further opposite signed track to make a  candidate .",
    "the 3 tracks from the  were required to make a good vertex , as were the extrapolated track from the  and the @xmath60 from the .",
    "the latter vertex was used to define the  decay length .",
    "the  energy was additionally required to exceed 20gev , but no particle i d ( ) cuts were applied .",
    "the resulting mass distribution is shown in figure  [ f : bsrec](a ) , for @xmath52 signal events , and the same events reconstructed assuming the @xmath60 from the  decay to have the kaon mass .",
    "the latter distribution , which forms a ` reflection ' background for the reconstruction of @xmath61 is reasonably separated from the signal , without the need for particle i d .",
    "the signal mass resolution is about 8mev , without the application of any kinematic fit .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency for this selection is about 20% , but many of the losses occur in requiring good vertices , which may be improved with better tracking code . assuming @xmath62 ( by analogy with @xmath63 @xcite ) and @xmath64 @xcite gives a total of about 500 reconstructed events in @xmath5  decays .",
    "the proper time of each decay was reconstructed from the measured decay length ( between the reconstructed primary vertex and the intersection of the @xmath65 and @xmath60 tracks ) and reconstructed energy of each candidate .",
    "the energy resolution is extremely good ( 0.5% ) and the proper time resolution is dominated by the decay length reconstruction .",
    "this was simulated separately for each of the vertex detector options available in brahms  ccd vertex detectors surrounding 1 cm and 2 cm radius beampipes , and an aps vertex detector with a 2 cm beampipe .",
    "the resulting proper time resolutions are shown in figure  [ f : bsrec](b)(d ) , together with the resolutions obtained from a double gaussian fit to the distribution of reconstructed minus true proper time .",
    "the resolution clearly depends strongly on which vertex detector option is chosen .",
    "the sensitivity to  oscillations as a function of  can be quantified by means of the amplitude method @xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath66 of oscillations at each ` test ' value of  is measured , in a method analogous to fourier analysis .",
    "oscillations are excluded if the value @xmath67 is excluded by the measurement , whilst exclusion of @xmath68 is required to establish a signal .",
    "the significance of the analysis is then quantified by the inverse of the error on @xmath66 , @xmath69 , which must be at least 5 to claim a signal ( ` @xmath70 discovery ' ) , and at least @xmath71 to set a 95% confidence level exclusion .",
    "the expected error can be calculated approximately by : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of events in the sample ,  the signal purity , @xmath74 the mistag and @xmath75 the proper time resolution .",
    "the results of this calculation for @xmath76 and @xmath77 are shown in figure  [ f : dmslim ] for each of the vertex detector options .",
    "the background to the @xmath52 signal is expected to be combinatorial and very small , due to the very good mass resolution and two intermediate mass constraints ( @xmath57 and ) .",
    "hence values of  close to one are expected to be realistic , although this has not been studied with simulation . with @xmath77",
    ", it can be seen that  oscillations can be discovered between 20 and @xmath78 , depending on the vertex detector options .",
    "this is comparable with the reach of cdf and atlas , though slightly lower than the @xmath79 expected by lhc - b @xcite .",
    "the larger reach of lhc - b is due to the much higher numbers of reconstructed events30000 as opposed to 500 for the linear collider , though the proper time resolutions are similar and the tagging better at the linear collider .",
    "however , such high values of  should also be visible through their effects on the  width difference ( @xmath80 ) , and are currently disfavoured within the framework of the standard model .",
    "the decay @xmath55 can be used to measure the ckm angle @xmath56 .",
    "however , its branching ratio is expected to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than that for @xmath52 , so only around 50 reconstructed events are expected in @xmath5   decays  not enough to measure the 4 time dependent decay rates necessary for this analysis .",
    "lhc - b expects around 2500 events per year in this channel @xcite so the linear collider is clearly not competitive , even with the large statistical advantage in tagging power .",
    "the decay @xmath82 is the  analogue of the @xmath83 decay , and can be used to measure the ckm angle @xmath12 .",
    "this asymmetry is expected to be very small in the standard model , so a significant asymmetry would be a sign of new physics . however , as with the other  decay modes discussed above , the relatively small number of  mesons produced at the linear collider make it uncompetitive with lhc - b , and also with atlas and cms in this decay channel which is easy to trigger on .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath82 is similar to @xmath83 , and with a 30% reconstruction efficiency 700 events are expected in @xmath5 . atlas and lhc - b expect around 40000 events @xcite , so again the linear collider is at a severe statistical disadvantage .",
    "various other strategies , involving the decays of  and  mesons , have been proposed to extract or constrain @xmath11 .",
    "some of these have been studied for babar @xcite and lhc - b @xcite .",
    "one method is to use rare @xmath86 and @xmath87 decays , however the combined branching ratios are so small that only a few events per year are expected at babar , and a few tens of events at lhc - b . in @xmath5",
    "the linear collider should collect similar numbers to lhc - b , so if these analyses are possible at all , the linear collider should be able to make a useful contribution .",
    "however , these channels have not yet been studied in detail .",
    "another proposed method is to make use of flavour symmetries in @xmath88 and @xmath89 decays .",
    "the feasibility of reconstructing two body b decays has been discussed in section  [ s : alpha ] .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath90 has not yet been studied but should present no major problems . again , if this analysis is possible , the linear collider should be able to make a useful contribution",
    ". however , the measurement of @xmath91 is also required , and if the penguin decay @xmath92 is also important , the linear collider will be at a disadvantage in not having particle id  the mass resolution can not be used effectively in final states containing reconstructed @xmath41 .",
    "the possibilities for doing electroweak and cp violation physics using a sample of @xmath5 hadronic  decays collected at a linear collider  factory with polarised beams have been investigated .",
    "huge improvements in the measurements of the coupling parameters @xmath93 and @xmath1 will be possible .",
    "@xmath1 can be measured to a precision on @xmath94 and @xmath93 to a precision of @xmath95 , corresponding to an error in @xmath6 of @xmath96 . however , to make this measurement useful the hadronic cross section below the @xmath97 needs to be measured to about 1% precision , in order to calculate the running of the fine structure constant up to the  mass .",
    "if the higgs has already been found , a stringent test of the standard model will be possible , and if not the higgs mass can be predicted with 5% precision . some interesting predictions in other models , such as the mssm , can also be made @xcite .",
    "however , the  partial width measurements can not be improved very much due to systematic error limitations . for @xmath98",
    "a factor five may be possible , while for @xmath32 and @xmath33 only a factor two is possible .    for the cp violation studies , whilst no ` golden ' measurements have been found that can be performed better than at any other facility , many useful measurements can be made that are complementary , and of a competitive precision , to those at @xmath8 b factories , the tevatron and lhc .",
    "these measurements can be made with the standard linear collider detector optimised for high energy running , and do not require dedicated particle identification detectors .",
    "useful contributions can be made to the study of the ckm angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 in a variety of decay modes .",
    "however , the study of @xmath11 , which mainly requires  meson decays , does not appear to be competitive with the lhc , due to the much larger numbers of b decays produced at the latter machine .    in summary , with relatively little investment in time and money a large improvement in the electroweak precision observables",
    "can be achieved , and some competitive and complimentary cp violation measurements can be performed .",
    "the  factory option is thus an attractive supplement to the already rich linear collider physics program .",
