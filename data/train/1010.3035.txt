    "the large scale structure has long been a major source of information on cosmic evolution .",
    "the most frequently used statistics of the large scale structure , such as the two - point correlation function and the density power spectrum , and especially the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) signatures in the power spectrum have been widely used in tests of cosmological models and precisional measurements of cosmological parameters @xcite . however , these two - point statistics do not exhaust all of the information content about the large scale structure  at least not in the non - gaussian case .",
    "there are also some limitations on the application of these statistics .",
    "as the perturbations grow larger , their evolution becomes nonlinear , resulting in a distorted power spectrum and the emergence of gravity - induced non - gaussianity .",
    "this has a crucial influence in the extraction of the absolute bao scale : at @xmath1 where the first bao peak is located , the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum amounts to 2% to 5% differences between @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . accurately modeling",
    "the non - linear evolution is highly non - trivial , and practical application in actual model test / parameter determination also requires fast and easy - to - implement algorithm .",
    "although progresses have been made in more sophisticated perturbative expansion @xcite or reconstruction @xcite procedures to correct for the effect of non - linear evolution , a precise yet practical method to take into account of these effects has yet to be developed .",
    "other systematic effects , such as the clustering bias and the redshift distortion could also affect the outcome of the measurement . such effects may significantly limit the accuracy of cosmological tests for future redshift surveys , where the statistical error on the bao scale would be at the one percent level .",
    "an alternative approach to the correlation function and power spectrum is the topology of the iso - density contours , in particular the genus of these contours .",
    "this offers another way to characterize the statistical property of the large - scale structure , and is insensitive to the systematic effects discussed above , since the intrinsic topology does not change as the structures grow , at least not until the iso - density contours eventually break at shell crossing@xcite .",
    "this provides a robust statistic for cosmology .",
    "compared with the power spectrum , the genus changes only by 0.5% between @xmath3 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true when using the volume fraction for the threshold levels to identify the contours .",
    "according to the second order perturbation theory @xcite , there is no change in the genus at median density threshold due to the weakly nonlinear evolution , because the iso - density contours enclosing a given fraction of volume do not change as long as the gravitational evolution conserves the rank ordering of the density .",
    "similarly , a monotonic clustering bias does not result in any difference in the iso - density contours , and a continuous coordinate mapping into redshift space does not affect the genus statistics either . in @xmath4cdm model with general relativity ,",
    "the genus is conserved during the different epochs in the linear regime of evolution .",
    "therefore , by observing the genus curve at the different redshifts and smoothing scales , one can use it as a robust standard ruler for cosmological measurements @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the phenomenological consequences of alternative gravity theories .",
    "a number of such models , e.g. the @xmath0 theory @xcite and the dgp brane - world model @xcite , have been proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe . unlike the general relativity , where the growth of the density fluctuation is at the same rate on all scales during the linear evolution , the modified large - scale gravitational forces induced by extra scalar field can in general introduce new scale dependence in the growth of structure , and therefore distort the genus curve in a time - dependent way .",
    "this provides us a new tool to distinguish gr from its various alternatives .",
    "it probes the combined effects of background expansion and the growth of the structures , and therefore is able to break the degeneracy between the dark energy and modified gravity models from expansion data alone @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a measurement also has the advantage that it is insensitive to nonlinear systematics .",
    "this is particularly useful because for some modified gravity models , such as the ones invoking the chameleon @xcite mechanism or the vainshtein mechanisms @xcite , it is non - trivial to treat the effect of nonlinear evolution on the power spectrum , and a conservative treatment on nonlinearity may only yield fairly weak constraints on gravity models with even strong signatures @xcite .",
    "the genus , on the other hand , is almost conserved during much of the evolution , thus allowing us to avoid dealing with such problems in the nonlinear regime . instead , we may make the calculation in the linear regime , and expect it to be almost unchanged until very late into the nonlinear regime .",
    "below in sec.ii we briefly review the calculation of the genus density and the cosmological perturbation theory in the parametrised post - friedmann framework . in sec.iii",
    "we discuss how the genus density changes in the various modified gravity models .",
    "we forecast the prospects of observation with the future redshift surveys in sec .",
    "iv and conclude in sec . v. an estimate of statistical uncertainty of the genus measurement is given in the appendix .",
    "the genus density @xmath5 is given by the genus @xmath6 , i.e. ( the number of holes - number of isolated regions ) divided by the volume @xmath7 .",
    "smoothing the tracer distribution by a gaussian filter with scale @xmath8 , then the iso - density contours of smoothed field can be identified for a given variance - normalized density threshold @xmath9 or volume fraction .",
    "the genus curve , i.e. the genus per unit volume of the iso - density contours as a function of such threshold , could be measured .    in the particular case of gaussian fluctuations ,",
    "the genus curve can actually be calculated analytically @xcite : @xmath10 and the amplitude @xmath11 is related to the power spectrum by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the window function for smoothing .",
    "the threshold level @xmath14 is related to the volume fraction @xmath15 on the high - density side of the density contour surface via @xmath16    although the genus is related to the power spectrum in the gaussian random field case , its measurement is completely independent of the power spectrum measurement , but rather by means of the gauss - bonnet theorem@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath6 is related to the integration of the gauss curvature @xmath18 over the surface , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the principal radii of curvature at the integration point . in practice , after smoothing the galaxies samples or simulation data into continuous density field , one first makes a fine tessellation of the whole volume of the space with small polyhedrons , e.g. cubes or truncated octahedrons , the iso - density surfaces can then be approximated by the polyhedral surfaces . since the only nonzero contributions to the integrated curvature of the polyhedral surfaces are from the vertices and are equal to the angle deficits , the genus of the iso - density contour at @xmath21 can be obtained by the summation of the angle deficit over all vertices @xcite .",
    "in this way , the genus of the iso - density contours is measured independent of the two - point statistics such as the power spectrum or correlation function , though mathematically we know that they should be related by eq.([eqn : genus_a ] ) in the gaussian case .    as the structures grow",
    ", the fluctuations would become non - gaussian gradually , and the genus is no longer solely determined from the nonlinear power spectrum of the structure .",
    "however , the amplitude of the genus curve @xmath22 does not change too much in the weakly non - linear regime , because the genus is a topological indicator which is independent of simple growth of clustering without merger . a general correction to @xmath23 for the non - gaussian field",

    ", further investigation @xcite shows that the directly measured genus amplitude is better conserved than the shape of the power spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : genus_a ] ) .",
    "the insensitivity of the genus to the nonlinear structure formation is not an artifact of the smoothing procedure , but reflects the more fundamental nature of topological property of the random field .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , when the correct redshift - distance relationship @xmath36 is adopted , one would be using the same comoving volume @xmath37 and smoothing scale @xmath38 at different epochs . here",
    "@xmath39 is the angular diameter distance and @xmath40 is the hubble expansion rate .",
    "therefore the data at different redshifts actually enclose statistically almost the same amount of structures , and the amplitude of genus curve @xmath41 would be almost the same at different redshifts .",
    "this can also be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : genus_a ] ) , which shows that @xmath41 actually measure the slope of the power spectrum around the smoothing scale @xmath38 . since in the linear regime of gr",
    "only the growth rate of the structure , not the shape of it , evolves , @xmath41 would be conserved .",
    "however , if an incorrect @xmath36 due to an incorrect cosmology is adopted , both @xmath42 and @xmath38 would be mis - estimated . since the topology of the structure is not scale - free , the genus enclosed in a wrongly sized volume and smoothed with a wrong scale would lead to deviation from the actual one , in this case @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the adopted cosmology parameters while @xmath45 is the true cosmology .",
    "the smoothing scale @xmath38 for different cosmologies are related to each other by @xmath46 utilizing this effect , topology of the large scale structure can serve as a standard ruler in cosmology .    since the genus would be affected by modifying the density perturbation through eq .",
    "( [ eqn : genus_a ] ) , we now consider the evolution of density perturbations in modified gravity .",
    "a wide range of modified gravity theories which satisfy the basic requirement of being a metric theory where energy - momentum is covariantly conserved , can be studied in the so called parametrized post - friedmann ( ppf ) framework @xcite . for these theories , on superhorizon scales structure evolution",
    "must be compatible with background evolution , on intermediate scales the theory behaves as a scalar - tensor theory with a modified poisson equation , while on small scales , to pass stringent local tests , the additional scalar degree of freedom must be suppressed . the evolution of linear perturbations in theories which satisfy these conditions can be characterized by a few parameters . with the newtonian gauge temporal and spatial curvature scalar perturbation @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we introduce @xmath49 in the absence of anisotropic stress , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 for the gr case .",
