    "claims for the existence of black holes rest upon observational evidence combined with theoretical arguments . here",
    "i analyze whether the theoretical arguments , valid within general relativity ( gr ) , remain valid when gr is modified , for instance by adding other terms to the ricci scalar in the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "black holes have a long and interesting history@xcite .",
    "the realization of a schwarzschild singularity was taken as a serious possibility in 1930 , after the work of chandrasekhar .",
    "he proved that white dwarf stars of high enough mass ( and low enough temperature ) are unstable against gravitational collapse .",
    "as is known today those stars do not collapse directly to black holes but suffer a supernova explosion , a core remaining in the form of a neutron star which is believed to evolve towards a black hole if the mass is large .",
    "the idea of collapsing stars had a strong oposition on the part of leading astrophysicists of the time , in particular eddington who assumed that some effect , not yet known , would prevent the collapse .",
    "the next important date was 1939 when einstein , then in princeton , and oppenheimer in california wrote three important papers which i shall comment in the following .",
    "all three papers dealt with spherically symmetric bodies , which might be studied using standard coordinates with metric @xmath2 in these coordinates the gr  hydrostatic equilibrium equation is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is @xmath5 times the newton constant , @xmath6 the radial coordinate , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass density , the radial pressure and the transverse pressure , respectively .",
    "oppenheimer and volkoff ( ov)@xcite solved eq.@xmath9 with the assumption of local isotropy , that is @xmath10 , and the equation of state , @xmath11 appropriate for a fluid of free ( non - interacting ) neutrons .",
    "the result was an one - parameter family of equilibrium configurations where the total mass , @xmath12 increases with the central density until a maximum about @xmath13 solar masses ( the @xmath14 limit ) and then decreases .",
    "the relevant conclusion was that there are no equilibrium configurations of free neutrons with mass above the @xmath14 limit . later on it",
    "has been proved that for interacting neutrons a limit still exists although it is somewhat higher , about @xmath15 solar masses .",
    "thus the question was , what happens to the core of a white dwarf after a supernova explosion when the core has a mass above the @xmath16 limit ? .",
    "in order to answer this question oppenheimer and snyder@xcite studied the evolution of a spherical cloud of dust .",
    "the result was that whatever is the initial configuration the whole cloud collapses to a black hole .",
    "this suggests that any neutron star with a mass above the @xmath14 limit would suffer a collapse , qualitatively similar to the cloud of dust .",
    "later calculations have confirmed this assumption , which has lead to the current wisdom that all observed compact ( cold ) objects with mass above the @xmath14 limit are black holes@xcite .",
    "einstein@xcite studied a model of star consisting of a spherical distribution of particles each one moving in a circle around a central point .",
    "thus the matter in the star may be considered as a fluid with extreme local anisotropy , that is nil radial pressure , @xmath17 .",
    "if this is put in the hydrostatic equilibrium eq.@xmath9 we get @xmath18 which has a solution for any ( spherical ) density distribution .",
    "in fact , given any function @xmath19 we may get @xmath20 via the second eq.@xmath9 whence eq.@xmath21 gives @xmath22 actually those functions @xmath19 which lead to a pressure violating the constraint @xmath23 @xmath24 should be excluded because this would mean that some of the constituent particles move with a velocity greater than that of light , @xmath25 . on the other hand it is easy to prove that the solutions of eq.@xmath26 with @xmath27 @xmath19 are stable against homologous collapse , which may be represented by a family of configurations depending on a parameter @xmath28 such that @xmath29 that is we should consider a sequence of configurations fulfilling @xmath30 with decreasing values of @xmath31 it is obvious that the ratio @xmath32 will increase indefinitely for @xmath33",
    ". then the homologous collapse should stop before the constraint @xmath34 @xmath19 is violated . from this result einstein concluded that the existence of a limiting velocity , @xmath35 prevents the collapse to a schwarzschild singularity , and he even asserted that for any star model ( i. e. not necessarily fulfilling @xmath17 ) this would be the case@xcite .    as is well known today einstein was wrong , because in the real world particles interact with each other and the interactions tend to produce local isotropy .",
    "actually between local isotropy , @xmath10 , assumed by ov@xcite in their neutron star calculation and extremal local anisotropy , @xmath17 , as in einstein model , there are intermediate cases .",
    "indeed calculations have been performed which prove that for some amount of local anisotropy , @xmath36 , the @xmath14 limit may be surpassed in neutron stars@xcite .",
    "however it is easy to prove that stars in stable equilibrium should have local isotropy , which in particular shows that einstein 's star model is unstable .",
    "in fact , let us assume an equilibrium configuration with density distribution @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 being the radial and transverse pressures respectively .",
    "now , in the absence of external electric or magnetic fields a fluid of neutrons with given baryon number density , @xmath40 has the minimal energy density for an isotropic velocity distribution , that is @xmath41 as a consequence if we start with an equilibrium star configuration presenting local anisotropy and change it to another configuration with the same @xmath42 but local isotropy everywhere , then the energy density decreases at every point where previously @xmath43 in summary we pass from an equilibrium configuration with local anisotropy to another configuration , maybe out of equilibrium , with the same baryon number but a smaller total mass . consequently the equilibrium star configuration is not stable .",
    "many authors have been reluctant to accept the existence of a spacetime singularity in the line of eddington and einstein .",
    "there are good reasons for that .",
    "in fact according to @xmath44 the metric of spacetime is ruled by second order differential equations and therefore it is natural to ask that the metric coefficients are twice derivable everywhere , with no singularity .",
    "the current solution to the problem is to assume that the singularity which appears in classical @xmath44 may be cured by quantum effects .",
    "but the good solution would be that quantum effects could modify @xmath44 in such a way that stars never collapse . on this line",
    "there is a recent proposal of `` gravastars '' , that is stars with a core where the vacuum , with equation of state @xmath45 provides a strong repulsive pressure able to stop the collapse@xcite . in this paper",
    "i propose a more natural solution , namely that the correct gravitational theory is an extended gr , derived from a modified einstein - hilbert action @xcite , and that in such gravity theory stars never collapse .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide arguments suggesting that this possibility is worth to be seriously studied .",
    "the most popular stars in newtonian gravity are polytropes , that is stars consisting of a fluid with equation of state @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are constant .",
    "it is well known that polytropes are stable ( unstable ) if @xmath48 is greater ( smaller ) than @xmath49 .",
    "it is the case that the most important types of newtonian ( or slightly relativistic ) stars where gravitational collapse is currently assumed are ( massive cold ) white dwarfs and supermasive stars@xcite and both may be treated as close to polytropes with @xmath50 thus these stars are at the limit of stability and it is believed that they become unstable due to gr corrections .",
    "in fact for a slightly relativistic star eq.@xmath51 may be written , assuming local isotropy , that is @xmath10 , @xmath52 the main term in the right side correspond to the newtonian approximation and the remaining 3 terms are the @xmath44 corrections .",
    "it is easy to see that every gr correction contributes to increase the gravitational field with respect to the newtonian one , therefore inducing unstability towards collapse . in the following i",
    "show that corrections derived from @xmath53 gravity have precisely the opposite effect .",
    "@xmath54 gravity derives from the einstein - hilbert action @xmath55 where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar and @xmath56 is an arbitrary function or @xmath1 , which i shall assume twice derivable .",
    "the action eq.@xmath57 gives the field equation@xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the ricci ( stress - energy ) tensor .",
    "the divergence of eq.@xmath62 leads to @xmath63    for a static spherical body in the metric eq.@xmath64 only the component with @xmath65 of the tensor eq.@xmath66 gives a nontrivial result , that is ( for local isotropy @xmath10 ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 now let us assume that the deviation from gr is not large , that is the right side of eq.@xmath69 is in some sense small ( note that the left side equated to zero just gives the gr eq.@xmath70 then for a slightly relativistic star it is consistent to neglect the terms @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the right hand side and we get @xmath73 similarly we have , from einstein 's equation , @xmath74 where i have taken into account that @xmath75 for an almost newtonian star .",
    "but in addition we have @xmath76 the former inequality being a consequence of the fact that the density decreases with increasing radius and the latter is true for slightly relativistic stars where @xmath77 .",
    "thus we may neglect the term with @xmath78 whence , taking eq.@xmath79 into account eq.@xmath80 gives finally the following effective gravitational field    @xmath81    the relevant result is that the latter term , which is the correction derived from @xmath53 gravity , is always positive because @xmath82 and the inequality @xmath83 holds true for any viable @xmath53 theory@xcite . in conclusion",
    "any modification of gr via f(r ) theory tends to compensate for the unstability created by gr in slightly relativistic stars .",
    "whether this is enough to prevent the gravitational collapse of white dwarfs or supermassive stars may depend on the form and size of the function @xmath54 , but i will not pursue the study here . in summary , although i can not claim that @xmath53 theory always prevents the gravitational collapse of white dwarfs and supermassive stars , it is true that their collapse is not unavoidable in @xmath53 theory , at a difference with standard @xmath84",
    "our second example will be the case of neutron stars in quartic gravity , where the lagrangian @xmath85 of eq.@xmath86 is@xcite @xmath87 the gravity theory resulting from this choice is not viable for , at least , two reasons .",
    "firstly it contradicts solar system and terrestrial observations or experiments , which require @xmath88 and @xmath89 not greater than a few millimeters .",
    "secondly the weak field limit of the theory presents ghosts .",
    "the difficulties may be solved if we assume that the theory resting upon eqs.@xmath86 and @xmath90 is an approximation , valid for fields of the order of those appearing inside or near neutron stars , of a theory giving a negligible correction to gr for weak fields .",
    "for instance , we might assume that eq.@xmath90 is an approximation of the theory resting upon the lagrangian @xmath91 in particular if we choose @xmath92 km@xmath93 eq.@xmath94 becomes @xmath95 and the relative error due to the terms neglected in going from eq.@xmath96 to eq.@xmath97 is smaller than @xmath98 in both cases .",
    "i have taken into account that @xmath99 and that typical densities are @xmath100 kg / m@xmath101 in the solar system and @xmath102 kg / m@xmath101 in neutron stars .",
    "i conclude that , in this example , the correction to @xmath44 would be negligible for the solar system ( and even more so for the cosmology at present time ) , but quite important for neutron stars . in any case",
    "it is irrelevant for the purposes of this paper the question whether the theory is viable or not .",
    "indeed i do not pretend to study neutron stars with the `` correct '' gravity theory which is unknown , but to provide a counterexample to the conjecture that stable neutron stars can not exist with more than twice the baryon number of the sun .",
    "the counterexample proves that such a limit does not hold true in extended gravity theories .    in",
    "the following i report on the results obtained from the calculation of noninteracting neutron stars using the gravity theory defined in eq.@xmath103 the field equation is@xcite @xmath104   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}a\\left [   g_{\\mu \\nu } -\\nabla _ { \\sigma } \\nabla _ { \\nu } g_{\\mu } ^{\\sigma } -\\nabla _ { \\sigma } \\nabla _ { \\mu } g_{\\nu } ^{\\sigma } + g_{\\mu \\nu } \\right ] = kt_{\\mu \\nu } ,   \\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] written in terms of the einstein tensor @xmath105 rather then the ricci tensor @xmath60 .",
    "when the components of @xmath106 are written in terms of the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 of the metric and their derivatives@xcite we get a system of 3 independent fourth order differential equations ( one of the four components of the tensor eq.@xmath109 is not independent because in spherical symmetry @xmath110 the constraints that @xmath111 and @xmath108 are finite at the origin and go to zero at infinity fix all the initial or boundary conditions except one , so that the solution of the 3 ( coupled , nonlinear ) ordinary differential equations provides a one - parameter family depending of the central value of the component @xmath112 . for simplicity in the calculation",
    "i have used as equation of state the following @xmath113 which has the correct behaviour for a fluid of free neutrons both at high and low densities .",
    "the constant @xmath114 is so chosen that a general relativistic calculation gives the same result as the original oppenheimer and volkoff@xcite  for the maximum mass stable star ( see table 2 below ) .",
    "a relevant quantity is the baryon number of the star , @xmath115 , which may be calculated from the baryon number density @xmath116 via @xmath117 the number density @xmath118 may be related to the mass density and the pressure from the solution of the equation @xmath119 which follows from the first law of thermodynamics . inserting eq.@xmath120 here we get a differential equation which may be easily solved with the condition @xmath121 for @xmath122 , @xmath123 being the neutron mass .",

    "_ the meaning of all symbols is as in table 1 , but here the matter pressure and density equal @xmath127 times the appropriate components of einstein 's tensor .",
    "the most dramatic difference between the calculations within extended gravity and within gr is in the variation of the baryon number with the central density . in gr",
    "there is a maximum about @xmath140 times the baryon number of the sun for some central density , @xmath141 and after that it decreases with increasing @xmath142 ( which gives the ov limit for the baryon number ) . in our calculation with modified gravity @xmath115 increases monotonically with the central density , which suggets that there is no limit .",
    "of course for the extremely high densities which appear in _ table 1 _ the individual neutrons would not exist and a fluid of different particles would appear , but we have used the same equation of state ( of free neutrons ) throughout .",
    "it is unlikely that a change of the equation of state could produce a very different qualitative behaviour , taking into account that for high density the equation should have the form @xmath143 in any case .",
    "the binding energy is also dramatically different in both calculations .",
    "finally the gravitational surface redshift surpases @xmath144 whilst in gr it is always smaller than @xmath145 , which seems to agree better with observations@xcite .",
    "the comparison with observations is however not too relevant because the results do not take into account the interaction between neutrons .    if the `` correct '' gravity theory gives results qualitatively similar to those in _",

    "the essential conclusion of the paper is that the theoretical arguments supporting the existence of black holes , which rest upon standard gr , may be no longer valid in extended gravity theories . if it turns out that gr must be modified ( possibly by quantum effects ) , then it might be the case that the alledged observational evidence for black holes should be revised .",
