    "the need to understand quantum systems in real time in a quantum field theoretic setting arose from attempts to understand various early universe scenarios .",
    "these scenarios are based on the evolution of scalar fields either through their role as inflation fields or as topological defect forming fields .",
    "one would like to understand the quantum evolution of these fields rather than rely on unjustified treatments based on studying their classical evolution .",
    "the study of the `` slow rollover '' transition in an upside down harmonic approximation by guth and pi@xcite was the first attempt to understand whether classical approximations could be justified .",
    "however , one really needed to go beyond the harmonic approximation to address the nonlinear aspects of double well ( and mexican hat ) potentials .",
    "these non - linear aspects effect production of topological defects as well as the nature of the oscillation at the bottom of the well which causes reheating .",
    "our ultimate goal is to be able to describe accurately over relevant time periods the nonlinear aspects of quantum field theory evolutions .",
    "although in one - dimensional quantum mechanics , one can rely on a numerical solution of the schrdinger equation to understand the time evolution of the system accurately over long time periods , in field theory contexts the numerical solution of the functional schrdinger equation is presently beyond the reach of the largest computers .",
    "one important question is how to decrease the number of degrees of freedom in a manner consistent with certain physical requirements such as conservation of energy , preservation of positivity and boundedness of expectation values .",
    "although this is guaranteed in variational approximations , approximations based on various truncation schemes , whether perturbative or non - perturbative in nature often fail to preserve these physical requirements .",
    "for example , naive truncations of the coupled green functions equations beyond the truncation at the two - point function level lead to secular behavior ( unboundedness at late times ) .",
    "this is also true for the @xmath0 expansion which is derivable from an effective action .",
    "the second question is , after guaranteeing these properties , how accurately have we described the time evolution .",
    "the simplest truncations of the field theory have been based on gaussian variational methods@xcite , or the related leading order in large-@xmath5 approximation ( loln ) @xcite .",
    "these two approximations can be shown to be equivalent to a classical hamiltonian dynamics for the variational parameters ( or equivalently the green functions ) which leads to probability conservation at the quantum level so that the results always lead to conserved energy , and positive and bounded expectation values .",
    "unfortunately , hard scatterings which lead to thermalization are ignored so that important physics is left out .",
    "the approximation also is numerically inaccurate after a few oscillations in quantum mechanical applications , unless the anharmonic coupling constant @xmath6 divided by the number of fields @xmath5 in an @xmath1 model is quite small . in this paper",
    "we will be comparing our methods of going beyond mean field theory ( hartree or large-@xmath5 ) with exact numerical simulations of a quantum mechanical @xmath1 model . in this way",
    "we can see how accurate the approximations are as a function of @xmath5 as well as study numerically if the approximation maintains the various physical requirements we posit , such as boundedness and positive definiteness of expectation values .",
    "the reason for using this quantum mechanical model is that exact simulations can be done at _ all _ @xmath5 , so that accuracy of the method as a function of the parameter @xmath0 can be studied . by restricting ourselves to a quantum mechanics problem",
    "we unfortunately will not be able to study questions of thermalization .",
    "a complementary approach has been undertaken by aarts , bonini , and wetterich@xcite where they consider _ classical _ 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath7 field theory ( for @xmath8 ) .",
    "there one can look at some aspects of classical thermalization ( as long as one keeps a cutoff because of the raleigh - jeans divergence ) but one is restricted to low values of @xmath5 so one can not study the @xmath5 dependence of the result . also one can not study the _ quantum _ aspects of the problem . in the above paper ,",
    "aarts _ et.al .",
    "_  study a truncation of the green functions at the four - point level , which is known to lead to unboundedness and secularity in quantum mechanical ( as well as classical ) applications .",
    "it will be interesting in the future to apply the approximations we are using here to classical 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath7 to see if , and how well , they describe the thermalization .",
    "there are several ways of approaching the problem of thinning the degrees of freedom of the quantum field theory .",
    "one of the earliest was based on making a variational approximation to the functional schrdinger equation .",
    "the variational approach has the advantage of leading to a hamiltonian dynamical system for the variational parameters as well as to a density matrix which has positivity properties .",
    "energy conservation and positivity and boundedness of expectation values are automatically guaranteed .",
    "however , even for the simple problem of the quantum roll , the gaussian , or time dependent hartree approximation , studied by cooper , pi and stancioff@xcite , and improvements which are based on trial wave functions of the form of a polynomial times a gaussian@xcite , were found to be only accurate for relatively short time periods ( one or a few oscillations ) when compared to the exact numerical solution of the schrdinger equation . in quantum mechanics , except for exceptional situations , the wave function in multiwell situations gets very complicated very quickly and is not easily described by a small number of variational parameters .",
    "a second approach has been a direct @xmath0 expansion of the path integral in the schwinger - keldysh - bakshi - mahanthappa closed time path formalism@xcite . in this approach",
    "the connected green functions have the property that they start at order @xmath9 .",
    "thus if we retain only a certain order in the expansion , there is a truncation in the order of green functions retained .",
    "this approach was applied recently to the quantum roll problem@xcite and was found to suffer from the secularity problem  although the short time behavior of the result was improved by including @xmath0 corrections , an exact reexpansion in terms of @xmath0 leads to corrections in the green functions that are of the form @xmath10 and so the individual corrections become unbounded as well as non positive definite .",
    "in this approach , although energy is conserved , individual contributions are not positive definite and unphysical behavior is found .",
    "a third approach has been to consider the complete set of equal time green functions .",
    "these obey first order local equations in time , as in the schrdinger approach .",
    "this approach has been nicely systematized and an equation for the generating functional obtained by wetterich and collaborators in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "however , naive truncations of the equal time green function hierarchy again have the problem that although there is a conserved energy , one can not show that this truncation ( except at the two - point level ) corresponds to a positive definite probability so that expectation values are not necessarily bounded or positive definite .",
    "truncated at the two point function level , this approach is identical to the hartree approximation .",
    "however , simulations based on truncations assuming 6th order or 8th order 1-pi graphs , could be set to zero , were carried out for the @xmath1 @xmath11 th oscillator problem , and secularity was found for many choices of initial conditions@xcite .",
    "so we , as quantum field theorists , having entered the domain of nonequilibrium phenomena , are now beset with all the problems faced by our plasma and condensed matter brethren more than 40 years ago !    in both quantum and classical many - body systems , the dynamical equations are an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations which relate given ensemble averages , whether classical or quantum , to successively more complicated ones . to make the solution of this hierarchy possible , some truncation scheme is necessary .",
    "most naive truncation schemes which , for example , just truncate the hierarchy of coupled correlators at a particular order , do not preserve various physical properties required of the system  such as positivity of the spectral components of the green function and conservation of probability .",
    "a corollary of this is that in most perturbation schemes , secularity arises quickly with each term in the perturbation series , growing with higher powers of the time @xmath12 . in his seminal paper of 1961 ,",
    "robert kraichnan@xcite discussed in detail the key issues and obtained a partial solution to the problem by demanding that the approximations one should use should correspond to some physically realizable dynamical system .",
    "this would guarantee positivity and secularity would be avoided .",
    "the reason why variational approximations avoid these problems is exactly because they lead to a hamiltonian dynamical system for the variational parameters ( which are related to equal time correlation functions ) .",
    "he also discussed scenarios where particular classes of graphs , which contained the relevant dynamics , are summed and he suggested some physically motivated approximations which did not suffer from any diseases . in field",
    "theory one rarely has the parameter control to make such guesses , however some progress in qcd has been made by summing hard thermal loops@xcite , which already tells us some of the graphs that we want to include . in plasma physics ,",
    "one wants to make sure that the approximation to the dynamics is robust enough so that the photon propagator includes polarization effects , which give debye screening .",
    "this is related to the hard thermal loop summation in qcd .    to find resummation schemes that avoid the secularity problem we will rely on the experience of our many - body and plasma physics friends .",
    "to calculate the conductivity of a non - relativistic plasma , it is known what graphs are necessary to sum in order to get agreement with experimental results@xcite .",
    "basically the conductivity is found from the vertex function which must satisfy an integral equation which sums ladders of the debye screened photon propagator .",
    "the two approximations we will discuss here will differ on whether the equivalent of the debye screened photon propagator for the anharmonic oscillator is treated in lowest order in mean field theory , or is self - consistently determined . in studying the conductivity of a relativistic plasma",
    "the first approximation has the advantage of obeying the correct ward identities ( but violating energy conservation to order @xmath0 ) whereas the second preserves energy conservation but violates ward identities ( to order @xmath13 ) . here",
    "we are not studying qed , and the ward identities of the @xmath1 model for the quantum mechanics problem are much simpler than those of qed and energy conservation is a more important constraint on the accuracy of the answer .",
    "we will include both approximations here mainly because of the recent interest in the gauge invariant approximation for the relativistic plasma@xcite , and also because in truncations of schwinger - dyson equations , it is often too difficult to solve for the photon propagator self consistently , and so one is often forced to try the more drastic approximation of using the mean field propagator in the resummation scheme . by studying this approximation in a quantum mechanics problem we will see the shortcomings of such an approach .    in what follows",
    "we will discuss two approaches to obtaining the above two truncations of the exact schwinger - dyson equation and apply them to the problem of the quantum roll  the long time behavior of @xmath5 coupled anharmonic oscillators with `` radial '' symmetry in an @xmath5-dimensional space .",
    "this particular problem has been studied by us previously@xcite exactly and in the next to leading order in the large-@xmath5 approximation ( nloln ) and is interesting because exact numerical solutions can be found for arbitrary @xmath5 .",
    "what we found previously , is that for the parameter set studied ( @xmath14 ) , the next to leading order in large-@xmath5 contributions became unbounded for @xmath15 . for larger @xmath5 , where the approximation was physical",
    ", it had the failing that it was unable to track the spreading of the exact wave function which led to the envelope of the oscillations found for @xmath16 contracting at late times and then reexpanding .",
    "a related study of large-@xmath5 for quantum mechanics in the context of the equal time correlators by bettencourt and wetterich@xcite , also displayed growing modes for various initial conditions .",
    "the resummation presented here will allow one to track the contraction for some period , but at later times it also fails in that it leads to small oscillations about a fixed point value .",
    "in field theory settings , where one hopes that this approximation will lead to thermalization , optimistically this fixed point behavior will become physical and be related to thermal equilibration . whether this is true or not can be checked by studying this approximation for classical evolutions averaged over a distribution of initial conditions described by a an initial probability distribution in phase space .    in what follows we will present numerical solutions for the quantum roll problem for the @xmath1 model , and compare them to these two different approximations to the schwinger - dyson equations , which sum infinite numbers of leading order and next to leading order in @xmath0 graphs .",
    "our approach will be to introduce a composite `` field '' @xmath17 which is treated on equal footing to the field @xmath3 . by doing that , the schwinger - dyson equations for",
    "the theory will have the same topology as those of qed with @xmath3 playing the role of the electron and @xmath18 the role of the photon . at leading order in large @xmath5 in n - flavor qed ,",
    "one sums all the fermion loop vacuum polarization corrections to the photon propagator which gives the debye screening . here",
    "the bare photon propagator is replaced by a local interaction in the graphs for the @xmath18 propagator in loln .",
    "the next consideration , important for charged plasmas , is that to obtain reasonable agreement with experiments on the conductivity of the plasma , the vertex function must sum all the ladders with the debye screened propagator as the kernel in the integral equation . the two resummation schemes which we discuss in this paper both have this property .",
    "the approximation which we call the bare vertex approximation ( bva ) , uses the full green function for @xmath3 as well as the full green function for @xmath18 in a 2-pi hartree graph contribution to the effective action .",
    "this is in contrast to an earlier scheme for going beyond @xmath0@xcite using the 2-pi formalism which is based only on the @xmath3 green functions .",
    "the bva approximation sums an infinite geometric series of 2-pi graphs of the single field formalism .",
    "recent simulations in a toy 1 + 1 dimensional scalar field theory@xcite show that the approximation described in@xcite already has the ability to thermalize arbitrary initial conditions , so we are confident that the bva approximation will also have that feature when applied to a field theory problem .",
    "the bva can also be obtained by setting the full vertex function to unity in the schwinger - dyson equations for the one- and two - point functions with external sources hence the origin of its name .",
    "the second approximation we will study , which we call the dynamic debye screening approximation ( ddsa ) , makes the further assumption that the full @xmath18 propagator can be replaced by the lowest order in @xmath0 composite field propagator in all the integral equations .",
    "the main interest in the ddsa results from it being the lowest order resummation scheme that _ exactly _ preserves qed ward identities .",
    "both these approximations are free from the difficulties found in the perturbative @xmath0 expansion , which we display for comparison .",
    "we find that the bva is accurate at modest times @xmath19 oscillations when @xmath20 . at later times",
    "it settles down to oscillating about an unphysical fixed point .",
    "the ddsa approximation violates energy conservation at order @xmath0 and as a result becomes inaccurate after several oscillations . in spite of this , it is numerically more accurate for a longer period of time than the hartree approximation at small and modest values of @xmath5 .    it should be kept in mind that quantum mechanics and quantum field theory are very different .",
    "for example , in the quantum mechanics application discussed here , the graphs of the @xmath21 corrections do not correspond to interparticle collisions ( as they do in field theory ) since we are restricting ourselves to one - particle quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless quantum mechanical examples provide excellent test beds for key issues such as positivity violation , boundedness , and late time accuracy of the approximations .",
    "it is precisely these questions that we are hoping to understand in this paper .",
    "the classical lagrangian for the @xmath1 model of @xmath5 non - linear oscillators is given by : @xmath22 the schrdinger equation for this problem is given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a potential of the form @xmath25 for the quantum roll problem there is spherical symmetry .",
    "this means that we can assume a solution of the form @xmath26 , in which case the time dependent schrdinger equation for @xmath27 reduces to@xcite : @xmath28 with an effective one dimensional potential @xmath29 given by @xmath30 it is this equation that we will solve numerically to obtain exact numerical solutions as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath29 has a minimum at @xmath31 . in our simulations , we have fixed our mass scale @xmath32 , defined as the second derivative of @xmath29 at the minimum , to have a value of 2 , independent of @xmath5 .",
    "returning to the lagrangian formulation , it is useful for the purposes of obtaining a large-@xmath5 expansion to introduce scaled variables : @xmath33 then the lagrangian scales by a factor of @xmath5 : @xmath34 we use these scaled variables in this paper , so that the rescaled @xmath35",
