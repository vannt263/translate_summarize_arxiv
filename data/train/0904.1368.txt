    "one of the major goals of ultrarelativistic nuclear collision studies is to obtain information on the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "a promising approach is the investigation of hadron production .",
    "hadron yields measured in central heavy ion collisions can be described very well ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) within a hadro - chemical equilibrium model . in our approach @xcite ,",
    "the only parameters are the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath2 and the baryo - chemical potential @xmath3 ( and the fireball volume @xmath4 , in case yields rather than ratios of yields are fitted ) , characteristic for a given energy ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "focused on production of hadrons carrying light ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) quarks , these investigations led to temperature values which rise rather sharply from low energies on towards @xmath810 gev and reach afterwards a plateau near @xmath2=165 mev , while the baryochemical potential decreases smoothly as a function of energy .",
    "this limiting temperature behavior reminds of the hagedorn temperature @xcite and suggests a connection to the phase boundary .",
    "it was , indeed , argued @xcite that the quark - hadron phase transition drives the equilibration dynamically , at least for sps energies and above .",
    "recently , the results of ref .  @xcite strenghtened the interpretation that the phase boundary is reflected in features of the hadron yields in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "whether the chemical freeze - out curve for @xmath9160 mev traces the qcd phase boundary at large values of chemical potential is an open question .",
    "possibly , the chemical freeze - out in this regime is influenced by exotic new phases predicted in @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether this statistical behavior is a unique feature of high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions or whether it is also encountered in elementary collisions , where finite size effects will obscure a possible phase transition . in early analyses ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is indeed argued that hadron production in e@xmath0e@xmath1 and pp is thermal in nature .",
    "furthermore , such analyses of hadron multiplicities ( for recent results see @xcite and refs . therein )",
    "yield also temperature values in the range of 160 - 170 mev .",
    "consequently , alternative interpretations for the apparent statistical behavior were put forward . these include conjectures that the thermodynamical state is not reached by dynamical equilibration among constituents but rather is a generic fingerprint of hadronization @xcite , or is a feature of the excited qcd vacuum @xcite . in such approaches",
    "the relation between hadronization and the qcd phase transition is not easy to make explicit .",
    "recent results employing the gauge / string theory duality imply also a thermal behavior @xcite , but remain to be further understood .",
    "in our recent analysis of hadron production in e@xmath10e@xmath11 collisions @xcite we have demonstrated that such a direct connection between thermal descriptions of hadron production in e@xmath10e@xmath11 and relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions is much less convincing than thought before .",
    "we first note that any thermal description of hadron production in e@xmath10e@xmath11 collisions makes use , in addition to the thermal parameters @xmath2 , and @xmath4 , of a set of additional , non - thermal parameters such as the number of strange , charm , and bottom quark jets as well as an additional strangeness ( but not charm ! ) suppression factor @xmath12 . for details see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated @xcite that , in spite of the additional , non - thermal parameters , the quality of the fit of e@xmath10e@xmath11 data to statistical model calculations is significantly worse than that obtained in descriptions of central nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "this conclusion is reached also when the fit to the data is performed using the same set of particles as in the nucleus - nucleus case .",
    "these findings call an overall thermal origin of particle production in e@xmath10e@xmath11 collisions into question , despite the presence of statistical features .    in the present paper we explore in some detail the heavy - quark ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) sector , i.e. the production of the corresponding open and hidden flavor hadrons in e@xmath10e@xmath11 as well as pp , p@xmath15 and p - nucleus collisions .",
    "the emphasis of our investigations is to establish quantitatively similarities and differences in the production of such particles in elementary collisions compared to those observed in the nucleus - nucleus case . since the proposal @xcite that the j/@xmath16 meson production may be a smoking gun observable for the diagnosis of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions , intense research was focused on the topic , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "a recent summary is found in @xcite .",
    "because the mass of heavy quarks exceeds the transition temperature of the qcd phase transition by more than a factor of 5 , heavy flavor hadron production can not be described in a purely thermal approach .",
    "it was , however , realized in @xcite that charmonium and charmed hadron production can be well described by assuming that all charm quarks are produced in initial , hard collisions while charmed hadron and charmonium production takes place at the phase boundary with statistical weights calculated in a thermal approach .",
    "for a recent summary of this statistical hadronization approach see @xcite .    in this context",
    "it became clear that even complete j/@xmath16 melting in the qgp via debye screening as assumed in the original proposal of @xcite could lead to large j/@xmath16 yields due to production at the phase boundary .",
    "predictions using the corresponding statistical hadronization model ( shm ) , either in its `` minimal '' implementation @xcite or with additional assumptions @xcite proved quite successful when compared to data . in its application to charm quarks",
    ", the statistical model contains as input the charm production cross section , taken from pqcd calculations @xcite or from experiment ( see ref .  @xcite and ref .",
    "therein ) . in general , statistical production can only take place effectively if the charm quarks reach thermal ( but not necessarily chemical ) equilibrium .",
    "combination of charm quarks which are initially separated by a few fm ( corresponding to about 1 unit in rapidity ) into charmonia effectively implies deconfinement .    to establish the uniqueness of the j/@xmath16 probe for the diagnosis of a qgp in nucleus - nucleus collisions it becomes important to understand whether similar thermal features as observed in nucleus - nucleus collisions are also at work in heavy - flavor hadron production in elementary collisions .",
    "our paper is consequently organized as follows : we first briefly describe the model used to analyze particle production in elementary collisions .",
    "section 3 deals with experimental results on heavy flavor hadron production in e@xmath0e@xmath1 collisions and their analysis in terms of our statistical approach .",
    "the more complicated case of pp and p - nucleus collisions is treated in section 4 , with particular emphasis on hidden charm production . in the final section",
    "we summarize our findings and provide an assessment of charmonium production as a probe for qgp and the qcd phase boundary .",
    "for the study of hadron production in e@xmath0e@xmath1 collisions we employ the canonical statistical model described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . for the present study",
    ", we perform calculations for two cases : i ) a 2-jet initial state which carries the quantum numbers of the 5 flavors , with the relative abundance of the five flavors in one jet and corresponding antiflavor in the other jet taken form the measurements at the @xmath17 resonance quoted in @xcite .",
    "these relative abundances ( 17.6% for @xmath18 and @xmath19 and 21.6% for @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) are thus external input values , unrelated with the thermal model .",
    "ii ) a purely thermal ansatz , i.e. a 2-jet initial state characterized by vanishing quantum numbers in each jet .    for the case of hadron production in elementary hadronic collisions",
    "we employ the canonical realization of the thermal model @xcite . for the description of the relative production cross sections of heavy flavored hadrons , the energy dependence of",
    "the temperature parameter is the only model input , which is taken in a parametrized form from the fits of hadron abundancies in central nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite . for c.m .",
    "energies beyond 10 gev per nucleon pair in nucleus - nucleus collisions a limiting temperature @xmath23=164@xmath245 mev is reached .",
    "recent fits of hadron yields in pp collisions @xcite give very similar values , independent of anergy .",
    "the charm production cross section , which is an important model input parameter for the calculations of absolute yields @xcite , cancels out for the ratios considered in the present paper .",
    "the influence of the mass spectrum on particle production has been considered in @xcite .",
    "we note that , for the ratios considered here , such an effect cancels out in first order and has been neglected .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] we show a comparison of data @xcite and model prediction for charmed and bottom hadron yields in e@xmath0e@xmath1 annihilations at @xmath25=91 gev . for the model we have used the parameter set : @xmath2=170 mev , @xmath4=16 @xmath26 and @xmath12=0.66 , which represents the best fit of multiplicities of hadrons with lighter quarks @xcite .",
    "e@xmath1 collisions compared to the thermal model calculations for two cases : i ) the 5-flavor jet scheme ( thick lines ) and ii ) no ( net ) flavor jet scheme ( thin lines with diamonds ) . note , for case ii ) the factor 10@xmath27 used to scale the model calculations for bottom hadrons to fit in the plotting range .",
    "the data are from the compilation published by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite .",
    "the prompt j/@xmath16 measurement j/@xmath28 is from the l3 experiment @xcite . ]",
    "we first note that the calculation employing the 5-flavor scheme is in very good agreement with the data , as demonstrated by the good @xmath29 per degree of freedom between the model and the data ( excluding the @xmath30 and prompt j/@xmath16 ) of 21.7/16 ( 34/18 when including all species ) .",
    "this confirms the conclusion of ref .  @xcite . despite this overall agreement ,",
    "the exceptions are significant : the @xmath30 meson yield is underpredicted by the model by 17 orders of magnitude , while the prompt j/@xmath16 yield @xcite is underpredicted by almost 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "obviously , the production of quarkonia is expected to be strongly suppressed in the statistical model .",
    "the disagreement is a consequence of the separate hadronization of the @xmath13 and @xmath31 quarks .",
    "the measured prompt j/@xmath16 production in @xmath17 decays ( into hadrons ) is about 3@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the thermal model predicts a prompt yield for j/@xmath16 of 4.1@xmath33 ( 1.6@xmath34 for @xmath35 and 4.3@xmath34 for @xmath36 ) , identically for the two calculation schemes .",
    "the overall measured yields of charmonia are dominated by the feed down from bottom hadrons and the model agreement only reflects the agreement seen for the open bottom hadrons and their branching ratios to charmonia , properly considered in the model .",
    "the calculation employing a purely thermal ansatz underpredicts all the measurements by many oders of magnitude , while for the light quark sector the differences between calculations with a pure thermal model and with the 5-flavor quark - antiquark scheme were found to be small @xcite .",
    "the strangeness suppression factor , which for the present results only enters in the calculation of the yields of @xmath37 and @xmath38 mesons , appears to have no counterpart in the heavy quark sector .",
    "this reflects the fact that a negligible number of @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks are formed in the fragmentation process . in this case , the thermal weights describe the distribution of the initial quarks into heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "thermalization is not required in this process .",
    "a collisions @xcite are compared to statistical model calculations @xcite shown by the line ( band corresponding to @xmath245 mev errors in @xmath2 ) .",
    "the box is the average value of all the data points with the corresponding error . ]",
    "we now turn to elementary hadronic ( pp , p@xmath15 , @xmath39a and pa ) collisions .",
    "we note an important difference in this case compared to e@xmath0e@xmath1 collisions , namely that the feeding from bottom hadrons into charmed hadrons is small at presently available energies due to the much smaller bottom production cross sectione@xmath1 collisions . even at the lhc energies @xmath401/10 , while in 91 gev e+e- b(z@xmath41)/b(z@xmath42)=0.22/0.17 . ] .",
    "in particular , this applies also to charmonia , although at lhc about 20% of the j/@xmath16 yield is estimated to originate from b mesons decays .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show , as a function of energy , the model comparison to data for the relative production cross section of charged to neutral d mesons .",
    "the data are from the recent compilation of ref .",
    "@xcite . considering the relatively large experimental errors ,",
    "the agreement is good .",
    "this can be judged from the comparison to the average value @xcite of the data points ( 0.405@xmath240.030 , with a @xmath29/d.o.f . of 1.12 ) ,",
    "shown as well in fig .",
    "this production ratio is largely determined by feed - down from the d@xmath43 states ( see discussion in @xcite ) and the agreement reflects the good description within the model of the relative production of the d@xmath43 states .",
    "relative to @xmath44 .",
    "the data for pa collisions are from the compilation by maltoni et al .",
    "@xcite ; the points for elementary collisions are from the phenix experiment at rhic @xcite and from the cdf experiment at tevatron @xcite ( see text ) ; the data point for pb+pb collisions at the sps energy is from the na50 experiment @xcite .",

    "[ fig3 ] we show the model comparison to data for the relative production cross section of @xmath35 and @xmath44 charmonia .",
    "the measurements in pa and pp(@xmath15 ) collisions are above the model values by about a factor 4 ( corresponding to 10 experimental standard deviations ; the average value of the measurements is 0.137@xmath240.009 , with a @xmath29 per degree of freedom of 0.88 ) .",
    "the relative production cross sections of charmonium states , as are observed in all measurements in hadronic collisions can not be described in the thermal approach .",
    "the temperature needed to explain the data would be 300 mev , well above the hagedorn limiting temperature , which is about 200 mev .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the ( only currently existing ) measurement in central nucleus - nucleus collisions , performed at the sps by the na50 experiment @xcite , which is well described .",
    "we recall that it was in part the observation of this measurement @xcite that brought forward the idea of statistical production of charmed hadrons in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "we note that the pa data exhibit a constant @xmath45 production ratio as a function of energy . in the model ,",
    "the value is determined only by the temperature and this is reflected in the slight decrease of the ratio towards low energies .",
    "a constant value , also up to the lhc energies , is predicted beyond @xmath820 gev .",
    "a constant value is expected in the color evaporation model @xcite .",
    "the measurements reported in fig .  [ fig3 ] demonstrate that the relative production cross section @xmath35/@xmath44 is identical in pa and in pp(@xmath15 ) collisions , implying no visible influence of the cold nuclear medium .",
    "note that the ratio for the tevatron energy was derived from the cdf measurements of @xmath44 @xcite and @xmath35 @xcite and is for transverse momentum @xmath461.25 gev / c ( we have extrapolated the @xmath35 measurement from 2 gev / c down to 1.25 gev / c ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we confront the model with the data on @xmath47 production .",
    "the data are from a recent compilation by the hera - b collaboration @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath48 representing the fraction of @xmath44 mesons from radiative decays of @xmath49 states , is clearly far above the statistical model prediction .",
    "the average value of the measurements is 0.361@xmath240.015 , with a @xmath29/dof=1.21 .",
    "an average value of 0.25@xmath240.05 was recently determined in an analysis of low energy data @xcite , also well above the thermal value .",
    "the relative production of the @xmath36 and @xmath50 charmonia , @xmath51 , is consistent with the model , as can be judged from the average value of the measurements ( which is 0.674@xmath240.084 , with a @xmath29/dof=1.39 ) , included in fig .",
    "we note that the data , characterized by rather large errors , are compatible as well with the expectation based on spin statistics only , which is @xmath51=0.6 .     and @xmath52 bottomonia relative to @xmath30 in pp(@xmath53 ) collisions .",

    "the model is compared to the latest results for the fermilab fixed target experiment e866 @xcite and in the collider mode from the cdf experiment @xcite .",
    "the data significantly exceed the thermal model calculations , by about an order of magnitude for the @xmath55 ratio and by almost two orders of magnitude for @xmath56 .",
    "for a recent overview of the status of qcd models for hadroproduction of quarkonia see @xcite .",
    "we have confronted the statistical hadronization model with the most recent data on the production of open heavy flavor hadrons and quarkonia in e@xmath0e@xmath1 and in pp and p(@xmath39)-nucleus collisions . employing the parameters extracted from the analyses of light flavor hadron production",
    "the model describes well the fragmentation to open heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "in contrast , quarkonium production can not be described in this framework .",

    "the relative abundance of the five flavors , taken from the measurements at the @xmath17 resonance , are external input values unrelated with the thermal model .",
    "we note that , in contrast to the hadrons carrying strangeness , for which a strangeness suppression factor @xmath59 is the outcome of the fit for e@xmath0e@xmath1 as well as for pp collisions , charmed and bottom hadrons are described in e@xmath0e@xmath1 collisions without any other parameter .",
    "the strange quark , with its intermediate mass , which is comparable to @xmath2 , seems to have an interesting intermediate status in between the very light and the very heavy quarks . in the hadronization process ,",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks reach abundances consistent with a thermal ensemble for @xmath60165 mev . on the other side ,",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 quark production is determined by either pqcd ( in pp ) or electroweak ( in e@xmath0e@xmath1 ) processes and the thermal model only describes hadronization phase space .",
    "in contrast , there is a significant number of newly produced @xmath7 and @xmath61 quarks , but incomplete equilibration leads to @xmath59 implying that @xmath7 quark abundances are not thermal .",
    "remarkably , strangeness suppression is lifted for central nucleus - nucleus collisions , implying full equilibration .",

    ". the model will be most dramatically tested at the lhc energies , where data are expected within a year .",
    "if confirmed , statistical production of charmed ( and possibly also bottom ) hadrons , in particular of j/@xmath16 , will provide a crucial determination of the qcd phase boundary . whether the bottom quarks equilibrate in the qgp",
