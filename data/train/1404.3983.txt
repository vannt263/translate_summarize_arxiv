    "the main purpose of study using relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the lhc is to investigate the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "+ a good probe suited to study the qgp properties is heavy quarks , i. e. charm and beauty .",
    "these are produced in hard partonic scattering processes at the initial stage of the collision .",
    "therefore , they work as self - generated probes of the medium created in these experiments . +",
    "heavy quarks lose energy while traversing the medium and , in case of sufficient re - scattering , they may even participate in the collective expansion of the medium .",
    "proton - proton and p - pb collisions serve as references for pb - pb collisions , since an extended qgp phase is not expected to be produced in these collision systems .",
    "particularly , the comparison of measurements in p - pb with those from pb - pb collisions allows the separation between cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects and those due to the presence of an extended , hot , and dense medium .",

    "electron identification is performed using information of the energy loss @xmath3 in the time - projection - chamber ( tpc ) , the time - of - flight provided by the time of flight ( tof ) detector and the @xmath4 ratio measured with the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mass ] ( left panel ) , illustrates the electron selection using the tpc and the tof detectors .",
    "+ the inclusive electron sample contains not only electrons from heavy - flavour hadron decays but also from various background sources , where the dominant contribution is from dalitz decays of light mesons , mainly @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and from photon conversions in the detector material .",
    "these contributions are statistically subtracted from the electron sample using the two methods described in the following . in the first method",
    ", contributions from electron - positron pairs from photon conversions or dalitz decays were subtracted utilizing the fact that they have small invariant mass .",
