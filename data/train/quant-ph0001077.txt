    "feynman [ fy ] described how , in principle , a finite dimensional quantum mechanical system could be made to evolve so as to execute a sequence of @xmath0quantum gates . \" by a quantum gate , we mean one of the several rather standard unitary operators applied to a small ( usually 1 , 2 , or 3 ) number of tensor factors ( and the identity on the remaining factors ) within a larger tensor product of factors of bounded dimension , often taken to be @xmath1 .",
    "for example : not , controlled not , and controlled @xmath2phase is known to be a complete basis [ ki ] .",
    "lloyd [ l ] made the converse explicit .",
    "let @xmath3 be a poly - local hamiltonian , @xmath4 is a sum of @xmath5 polynomial(problem size ) terms @xmath6 , each the identity except for a constant number of tensor factors .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath3 exponentiates to @xmath7 which is well approximated by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the allowed ( operator norm ) discrepancy between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the poly - local assumption on @xmath3 is very natural for most real world quantum mechanical systems and is often summarized by the axiom : @xmath0physics is local .",
    "`` for example , in quantum field theory interactions tensors with more than four indices are generally not renormalizable . in more exotic contexts , such as , fractional quantum hall systems [ w ]",
    "topological models have been proposed for which the hamiltonian acting on internal degrees of freedom vanishes identically @xmath13 , yet after a topological event , such as a braiding @xmath14 is completed , the internal state is transformed by @xmath15 . for systems of this type ( called : a unitary topological modular functor ) a distinct argument was provided [ fkw ] that @xmath15 is poly - local . there seem to be few remaining candidates - perhaps quantum gravity - for a physical system having a finite dimensional state space whose evolution can not be well approximated by a poly - local transformation @xmath11 .",
    "this reinforces confidence in the quantum circuit model qcm [ ki ] , and motivates the examination of ( families of ) transformations having a poly - local description .",
    "any poly - local unitary transform is available as a @xmath0subroutine '' on a quantum computer , but it will not generally be a simple matter to recognize a transformation as lying in ( or efficiently approximated by ) that class .    while a simple volume argument shows that only a tiny fraction of the unitary group @xmath16 can be approximated ( up to phase ) by poly - local transformations , it is not known how to give concrete examples which can not be thus approximated .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of the fact that transcendental numbers are easily seen to predominate , but less easy to identify . to add to the puzzle , in most contexts",
    ", we will be free to add ancilli to create an inclusion @xmath17 , @xmath18 of one hilbert space into a larger one .",
    "it seems likely that there may be an operator @xmath19 which is not well approximated by poly - local operators but its extension @xmath20 is . in this",
    "regard , michael nielsen has pointed out ( private communication and chpt .",
    "6 [ cn ] ) that the exponential of any hamiltonian which is a sum of polynomially many product terms can , with the help of ancilli , be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer .",
    "there is no requirement on the individual product terms except that they be products , i.e. a tensors of operators each acting on one ( or up to log many ) qubit(s ) .    to appreciate the importance of a poly - local description",
    "consider the fft .",
    "the reader familiar with the fast fourier transform may be surprised that it has a virtue in the quantum context since it is already fast , @xmath21 , classically .",
    "but on this scale , we should think of the quantum version as poly@xmath22 in the sense that we may fourier transform in poly@xmath22 time a data vector @xmath23 ( held in superposition and previously computed in poly@xmath22 time ) into its discrete fourier transformation @xmath24 .",
    "the measurement phase of quantum computation samples the transform according to the density of its @xmath25norm squared . in a sense",
    ", this is the best we could hope for in poly - log time .",
    "we could never output the entire transform in less than @xmath26 time , instead sampling shows us its sharpest spikes . similarly with other transforms , a poly - local description allows us to sample , according to the @xmath25 norm , that transform applied to any rapidly computable function .",
    "a key step in the shor factoring algorithm is his description of the discrete fourier transform @xmath27 for the cyclic group of order @xmath28 , where @xmath28 is a large smooth number , as a poly - local transform ( the size parameter is @xmath29 so @xmath30 must be written as a composition of poly@xmath31 many gates ) .",
    "we construct another class of examples by showing that cyclic periodic near diagonal matrices are poly - local ( thm 1 ) .",
    "the construction is direct - no ancilla qubits are used . as an application , we prove ( corollary 1 ) that all the standard orthogonal discrete wavelet transforms , in particular the daubechies transforms @xmath32 [ d ] , are poly - local .",
    "i thank c. williams for pointing out that he and a. fijany previously obtained an explicit factoring of @xmath33 ( = haar ) and @xmath34 into quantum circuits [ aw ] .",
    "our alternative approach has the usual virtues and demerits of abstraction .",
    "some perspective into the limitations poly - locality imposes on the poly - time computational class of the qcm , bqp , can be achieved by adjoining .",
    "let @xmath35 be a @xmath0super - gate `` which can be called upon in addition to gates to transform the computational state @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath37 encodes the answer to a difficult ( or even undecidable ) problem @xmath38 , @xmath39 will be improbable strong : if @xmath40 is a function and @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 and @xmath37 is the linear extension of @xmath43 operating on @xmath44 , then we can compute @xmath45 by measuring the last qubit of @xmath46 .",
    "however , if we stipulate that @xmath37 is @xmath0locally - poly '' meaning that the @xmath47 entry of @xmath37 be computable in poly@xmath48 time , can the nonlocal structure of such @xmath37 by virtue of their size alone , extend qcm ?",
    "the following observation is evidence that the answer is @xmath0yes . \"    for each family of bijections @xmath49 which is computable in polynomial(n ) time there is a family of oracles @xmath37 with entries @xmath50 computable in poly@xmath51time so that @xmath52 can be computed by @xmath53 .",
    "simply set @xmath54 .",
    "write the bit string @xmath55 .",
    "then @xmath56 , so applying @xmath37 to @xmath57 and then measuring each qubit separately solves the inversion problem @xmath58 . thus , one - way functions disappear if we are permitted to adjoin locally - poly yet non - poly - local oracles .",
    "we have not succeeded in solving an @xmath59 complete problem with such an oracle .",
    "it is common in signal processing to encounter smoothing operators which when written as matrices are band diagonal .",
    "often mathematical reasons suggest wrapping the interval into a circle and considering cyclically banded matrices @xmath60 , @xmath61 unless @xmath62 .",
    "two additional conditions natural in signal processing are unitary , @xmath63 and cyclicity @xmath64 , addition of indices taken @xmath65 .",
    "all these conditions occur in [ p ] .",
    "we fix @xmath14 and @xmath66 and considering @xmath67 as parameter approaching infinity for studying the family of @xmath68 matrices @xmath69 . to summarize the @xmath69 are @xmath68 unitary matrices , @xmath70band diagonal _ in the cyclic sense _ , cyclic with period @xmath66 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore even among different @xmath69 , @xmath73 , we assume @xmath74 . if @xmath75 and @xmath76 , so the matrices look locally identical .",
    "purely for convenience , we also assume all @xmath67 are powers of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 some fixed constant and @xmath80 , this makes the fit with qubits effortless .",
    "a final technical assumption is necessary to efficiently approximate even a small @xmath81 , @xmath82 , from gates available in the qcm .",
    "it is sufficient here [ ki ] to require the entries @xmath83 are algebraic numbers .",
    "this prevents some difficult to obtain information being encoded in the entries themselves .",
    "the theorem below asserts that the family @xmath84 is poly - local in the strictest sense : no ancilla are introduced to stabilize the problem .",
    "let @xmath84 be as above , there is a polynomial @xmath85 so that for any @xmath10 there is an @xmath86 , @xmath87 close to @xmath69 in the operator norm , so that @xmath86 is a composition of @xmath88 gates in the qcm .",
    "it is sufficient to consider @xmath89 , for @xmath90 greater than any fixed number , so the reader may image @xmath69 , @xmath67 comfortably large . for some @xmath91 , some @xmath92 , we will modify @xmath93 to @xmath94 to a unitary @xmath95cyclic matrix which agrees with @xmath93 except @xmath96periodically for a small ( order @xmath14 ) slab of rows where @xmath94 agrees with the identity matrix and a small ( order @xmath14 ) transition region between the two types of rows .",
    "the construction of @xmath94 is very similar to the truncation process given in [ f , p ] so we will not give formulas here , but simple principles from which @xmath94 may be constructed .",
    "let @xmath97 be the vector subspace spaned by the rows of @xmath69 whose row index lies in @xmath98 ( we think of @xmath98 as an interval with integer end points on the circle consisting of @xmath99 ) .",
    "let @xmath100 be the subspace spanned by the basis vectors with indexes in @xmath101equivalently those rows of the identity @xmath102matrix .",
    "from the nonsingularity of unitary matrices we obtain :    whenever @xmath103 contains the @xmath70neighborhood of @xmath98 , @xmath104 and @xmath105    we apply the lemma several times below : consider an interval @xmath98 of @xmath106 rows and a larger interval @xmath103 of @xmath107 rows containing @xmath98 symmetrically .",
    "let @xmath108 and @xmath109 denote the intervals of length@xmath110 at containing the @xmath111 and @xmath112 end points of @xmath103 respectively .",
    "the rows @xmath113 of @xmath93 in the complement of @xmath98 together with the rows @xmath114 of the identity matrix in the interval @xmath103 span the entire space .",
    "let @xmath115 denote the rows of @xmath93 with indices in @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the gram - schmidt process applied to @xmath116 ( the gram - schmidt process requires an ordering ; work from the middle of the @xmath103 interval outward ) produces a hermitian- orthogonal frame @xmath117 for the space spanned by @xmath118 ( note : @xmath119 span the entire space ) .",
    "this process naturally leaves the central @xmath120 rows of @xmath114 unchanged , i.e. they remain standard basis vectors .",
    "the geometry of this process is pictured below .",
    ".1 in = 3.5 in    figure 2    .1 in    the frame @xmath117 consists of @xmath121 standard basis vectors together with @xmath122 vectors of length @xmath123",
    ". think of these @xmath124vector as mediating a transition from rows @xmath113 of @xmath93 to rows @xmath114 of the identity matrix .",
    "the truncation process preserves unitarity and band diagonality and the band width .",
    "@xmath125 is block diagonal consisting of @xmath126 identical blocks @xmath127 ( independent of n ) down the diagonal .",
    "thus , @xmath125 has a tensor decomposition @xmath128 .",
    "define @xmath129 . clearly",
    "the rows of @xmath130 agree with the identity matrix outside the @xmath131intervals and @xmath130 is @xmath70band diagonal .",
    "thus , @xmath130 can be written in a tensor product form as well : @xmath130 consists of identical blocks down the diagonal of size @xmath132 provided @xmath133 .",
    "thus , we may write @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a cyclic permutation matrix of @xmath136 . the permutation must arise since the blocks of @xmath137 are off - set from the blocks @xmath125 by a translation of @xmath138 .    because we assumed the entries of @xmath93 to be algebraic",
    "so are the entries of @xmath127 and @xmath137 .",
    "it is well - known that algebraic numbers can be efficiently computed using newton s method so that refining the numerical accuracy of an algebraic @xmath139 to up to a factor of @xmath140 requires only constant@xmath141 poly @xmath142 computational steps .",
    "now by a theorem of [ ki ] for approximating a unitary transformation in a fixed dimension as a product of gates , we find matrices @xmath143 and @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 using the operator norms , with @xmath143 and @xmath144 a product of poly @xmath147 elementary gates .    the cyclic permutation @xmath135 and its inverse @xmath148 are , of course , poly@xmath149 time computable classically . writing @xmath150 in an initial register and @xmath151 in an equal large ( size @xmath152 , @xmath89 ) register of ancilli a well - known sequence of operations effects the transformation : @xmath153 ( where @xmath111 denotes bit wise mod @xmath77 sum in the register ) .",
    "more directly , it is possible to build size @xmath154 circuits from @xmath0not , @xmath0controlled not , `` and @xmath0swap '' gates ( see section 2.4 [ aw ] . ) , which use no ancilli and implement addition of @xmath138 modulo @xmath67 . for example , a circuit implementing @xmath155 is shown below .",
    ".2 in    figure 3    .2 in    thus , all the 4 terms of an @xmath156approximation @xmath157 may be written as a product of poly @xmath158 many gates : @xmath159 .",
    "we define a discrete wavelet transform as the result of the [ m ] - applied to a band diagonal quadrature mirror filter .",
    "daubachies [ d ] original basis is recovered by choosing a quadrature mirror filter whose + have a maximal number of vanishing moments ( consistent with orthogonality relations ) .",
    "for example , the simplest daubachies wavelet daub@xmath161 is built from an orthogonal matrix(and mirror filter ) : @xmath162 satisfying moment conditions : @xmath163    first let us explain in algorithmic terms how the of an data ( column ) vector @xmath164 are computed starting from a filter @xmath93 as above ( compare [ p ] ) .",
    "the even components of @xmath165 are regarded as @xmath0smoothed `` and these are set aside for further processing .",
    "the odd components of @xmath165 are the finest scale wavelet coefficients .",
    "to continue processing apply the matrix identical in description to @xmath93 , but of half the size to the even output of @xmath166 . again set the even output aside : the odd output are the wavelet coefficients at the next - to - smallest scale",
    "now apply @xmath167 , etc ... the process must terminate when @xmath60 becomes so small that wrapping around of rows threatens unitarity .",
    "for daub@xmath161 the last @xmath60 will be a @xmath168 matrix .",
    "the wavelet coefficients of @xmath169 , usually written as @xmath169 integrated against a function @xmath170 , are the output of the final differencing ( proceeded , possible , by several smoothings ) .",
    "the @xmath0mother '' or @xmath0scaling \" coefficients will be the output of successive smoothings ( i.e. even rows ) . these are traditionally written as @xmath169 integrated against a function @xmath171 ; there will be two of these for daub@xmath172 .    the pyramid algorithm consist of only @xmath173 many applications of a filter matrix @xmath60 , obeying the hypotheses of the theorem , and some easily computed permutations needed to sort out the even from odd rows between applications of @xmath60 .",
    "thus from the theorem , we have an evident corollary , which should be compared with the constructions of [ aw ] and [ kl ] .",
    "consider a poly - time computable function of @xmath174 from the integers @xmath175 $ ] into a fixed basis of a vector space @xmath176 of dimension @xmath177 .",
    "the function @xmath174 is recorded by a vector @xmath178 . for any discrete ( algebraic ) wavelet",
    "transform @xmath179 applied to @xmath174 , there is a quantum circuit , without ancilla , of length poly@xmath180 which yields a state space vector @xmath181 which is within @xmath182 of the exact transform @xmath183 .",
    "the components of @xmath184 can be sampled by von neumann measurement according to the density @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 .",
    "the proceeding recipe , in so far as repeated smoothing is applied , sends a @xmath0dirac function \" @xmath188 toward a fixed point of the iteration @xmath189 .",
    "such a fixed function @xmath171 is called the scaling function of the filter @xmath60 .",
    "wavelet coefficients ( in the limit ) correspond to integrations against @xmath190 where @xmath191 .",
    "whereas , the fourier transform efficiently extracts information about periodicity ( hence its relevance to divisibility and factoring questions ) the wavelet transforms ( discrete or continuous ) extract qualitatively different information .",
    "it is less easy to say precisely what combinatorial structures wavelets are best suited to detecting , but the answer must relate to phenomenon with a certain amount of both spacial and frequency localization .",
    "some studies suggest fractal behaviors , hausdorff dimension , and the like are readily observed in wavelet bases .",
    "thinking democratically , one should not prefer either fourier or wavelet bases , but seek different problems which can be solved by sampling the density of one transform or the other .",
    "so far on the fourier side there is discrete log , factoring , and the abelian stabilizer problem [ s][ki ] - essentially similar applications of that transform , and no interesting quantum applications , yet known , for the wavelet transforms .",
    "both shors [ s ] use of the fourier transform and our treatment of wavelet transforms concerns the @xmath0vectorized \" transform : the function values of @xmath192 in shor s work and the values of @xmath174 mod@xmath193 in our corollary 1 are treated as independent basis vectors in an abstract vector space .",
    "the transforms do not treat similar function values similarly , but rather place each possible outcome of @xmath194 into a separate bin .",
    "thus , there is no notion of _ the continuum limit _ of these transforms as presently constituted and they should not be confused with their continuous relatives in signal processing .",
    "the property of a function @xmath174 on the integers having period @xmath177 is under arbitrary permutation ( or vectorization ) of the target .",
    "this fact is crucial to the efficacy of the fourier transform in shor s algorithm .",
    "it is more difficult to see what portion of the information captured by a wavelet transform is invariant under target permutation or vectorization .",
    "although it seems that a continuous - as opposed to vectorized - fourier transform is as useful for factoring , their may be other quantum applications for the continuous version . in the case of wavelets , it is more likely that continuous rather than vectorized transforms will be important . in the following paragraph , we explain how to use phase coding of states to build efficient continuous versions of any transform @xmath179 ( such as fourier or wavelet ) for which there is an efficient quantum circuit implementation of the vectorized version .",
    "let @xmath195\\longrightarrow [ 1 , \\dots , d]$ ] be a funtion and denote @xmath196 $ ] as the variable . for @xmath197",
    ", we may define @xmath198 if @xmath199 , and @xmath200 if @xmath201 . a @xmath0vectorized \" unitary transform obeys : @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the transform variable , and states are written without numerical normalization factors . if we pick @xmath204 and let @xmath205 , the set of complex numbers @xmath206 is a short discretized arc of a circle and is a rather good affine model for @xmath207 $ ] under the bijection @xmath208 .",
    "after linear rescaling the quasi - isometric distortion of b is @xmath209 ( a map @xmath210 between metric spaces is said to have quasi - isometric distortion @xmath211 for some @xmath212 iff : @xmath213 we will neglect this distortion and code the values of a bounded real function @xmath214 \\longrightarrow \\big [ 0 , \\frac{2 \\pi d}{d}\\big]$ ] into @xmath215 \\longrightarrow \\bigtriangleup$ ] , @xmath216 where @xmath217 rounds to the nearest element of the form @xmath218 .",
    "now a continuous version @xmath219 of @xmath179 applied to @xmath220 is given by the formula : @xmath221    note that there is a simple modification of a quantum circuit computing @xmath179 to one computing @xmath219 . instead of simply recording the qubit @xmath222 by adding @xmath223 to a @xmath224state register @xmath225 holding zero ,",
    "the trick is to initialize @xmath225 to the superposition : @xmath226 now adding @xmath223 to the above state simply changes its phase by a factor of @xmath227 .",
    "thus , the transform @xmath219 , possessing a natural continuum limit , can be sampled in the qcm with no more difficulty than the discrete version @xmath179 .",
    "if quantum computers are built , such continuous transforms would find application in signal processing . beyond these obvious applications ,",
    "it is interesting to wonder what algorithmic potential lies in these continuum transformations .",
