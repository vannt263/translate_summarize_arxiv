    "macrophase separation in a block copolymer melt is prevented by the chemical connectivity of the constituent blocks , which leads to microphase separated structures with @xmath3 , typically corresponding to structural periods @xmath4 @xcite . in a blend containing a block copolymer melt and one or more molten homopolymers ,",
    "microphase separation of the block copolymer can compete with macrophase separation of the homopolymers at low temperatures @xcite .    in a binary blend of a block copolymer and a homopolymer",
    ", the homopolymer swells the microphase separated structure formed by the copolymer , if the homopolymer chain length is less than or equal to that of the corresponding block @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "macrophase separation can occur for homopolymer chains longer than the corresponding block . in a ternary blend ,",
    "block copolymer added to a blend of homopolymers acts as a compatibilizer to prevent macrophase separation or reduce the lengthscale associated with the macrophase separated structure @xcite . a similar interplay between micro- and macro- phase separation",
    "has recently been explored experimentally for @xmath5 diblock copolymer blends by hashimoto and coworkers @xcite .",
    "recently , self - consistent field theory has been applied to examine the phase behavior of binary homopolymer / copolymer blends @xcite , blends of two homopolymers with block copolymer @xcite and binary blends of block copolymers @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting critical phenomena have been predicted for certain blends of copolymer with one or two homopolymers .",
    "the latter case was first studied using landau mean field theory , employing the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to lines of critical points corresponding to macrophase separation or microphase separation , mean field theory predicts that lifshitz points can occur at the boundary between disordered , uniformly ordered and periodically ordered phases @xcite .",
    "the wavenumber for microphase separation approaches zero continuously as the lifshitz point is approached @xcite .",
    "a lifshitz point was first observed experimentally in the phase diagram for blends of two polyolefin homopolymers and the corresponding diblock via small - angle neutron scattering by bates _",
    "however , subsequent work showed that composition fluctuations destroy the mean field lifshitz point and a microemulsion phase becomes stable @xcite .",
    "mean field theory can then be used to locate the region of microemulsion stability via the virtual lifshitz point .",
    "in contrast to these studies of copolymer / homopolymer blends and blends of ab diblocks , we are unaware of any experimental work on blends of an ab diblock with a bc diblock .",
    "this letter presents some predictions for these systems which should stimulate future experimental work .",
    "we employ the rpa , first applied to ab diblocks by leibler @xcite , to locate spinodal points for macro- or micro- phase separation , and to compute the wavenumber and eigenvector of the unstable mode .",
    "this approach is expected to be valid for long , weakly segregated , chains .",
    "generalization of the approach outlined here to allow for composition fluctuations and finite chain length should be straightforward , using methods developed for pure block copolymer melts @xcite .",

    "it is convenient to define the basis set @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a volume changing fluctuation and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are physical fluctuations in an incompressible system .",
    "the fluctuation @xmath25 corresponds to separating the @xmath9 and @xmath10 blocks from the @xmath26 block , and is primarily a microphase separation mode , since it is prohibited at @xmath27 by chain connectivity .",
    "the other mode,@xmath28 , corresponds to demixing the @xmath9 and @xmath10 blocks , and in the limit @xmath29 corresponds to demixing the blend .",

    "obviously the system is far richer ( and more complicated ) than that of simple diblocks . rather than systematically calculating phase diagrams ,",
    "we first discuss the nature of macro- and micro - phase separation , and then examine the character of the possible lifshitz points .",
    "in the @xmath0/@xmath0 limit ( @xmath47 ) macrophase separation can not occur ; while for large enough @xmath48 macrophase separation is possible .",

    "the microphase mode shows a minimum at finite @xmath40 , but remains positive .",
    "the instability of the macrophase mode can be easily understood , since an @xmath58 homopolymer melt requires @xmath59 for macrophase separation , and the corresponding @xmath58 diblock melt requires @xmath60 for microphase separation .",
    "hence pure microphase separation is more costly , and if the system can take advantage of some macrophase separation ( _ i.e. _ including some component of the eigenvector @xmath31 ) , it will do so .",

    "the asymmetry about @xmath64 is due to the distinct temperature dependence of the three @xmath18 parameters .",
    "generally the bimodal associated with the macrophase spinodal `` buries '' the microphase endpoint and we expect , with increasing @xmath18 , macrophase - macrophase coexistence , macrophase - microphase coexistence , and microphase - microphase coexistence . as the copolymers become more symmetric , the region of macrophase separation narrows , and the criticial point for macrophase separation coincides with the microphase endpoint at a copolymer volume fraction @xmath65 at a first order lifshitz point ( fig .",

    "( and the other microphase endpoint ) there is an infinitesimal amount of @xmath39 , and the majority of the instability is in the macrophase mode , @xmath31 .",
    "as the pure system is approached ( either @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) the fraction of @xmath39 increases but , interestingly , does not approach @xmath69 .",
    "this is due to the chemical asymmetry between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "as with a homopolymer blend , the critical composition @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 , yielding @xmath72 @xcite . at @xmath70 the critical point @xmath73 for macrophase separation is given by @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath75 macrophase separation occurs directly from the disordered state ; while for @xmath76 microphase separation at finite wavenumber @xmath57 occurs directly from the disordered state ( and the macrophase separation spinodal is `` buried '' ) .",
    "the limit @xmath2 defines a point at which the line of microphase separation transitions meets the spinodal for macrophase separation , determined by @xmath77 . by tuning the material parameters we can easily find a first order lifshitz point , where @xmath77 at the critical point , @xmath70 ; and a second order lifshitz point , at which @xmath78 at @xmath70 @xcite . in principle ,",
    "one may tune the material parameters further to find third ( @xmath79 ) , fourth ( @xmath80 ) , and fifth ( @xmath81 ) order lifshitz points .",

    "a third order lifshitz point can , in principle , then be found by adjusting @xmath83 so that @xmath79 ; and @xmath85 and @xmath86 could then be adjusted to find fourth and fifth order lifshitz points ( with @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively ) .",

    "[ fig : lif]a ) * a * and * c * are the lowest-@xmath18 features in their phase diagrams , and should be accessible directly from the disordered state .",
    "the lifshitz lines are shown both in the @xmath87 plane ( indicating where in the phase diagram to look ) , as well as in the @xmath88 plane , indicating the trajectory in architecture space .",

    "the nature of the spinodal diagram for * c * suggests that the macrophase separation window could indeed vanish at third order lifshitz point for certain values of the parameters .",
    "the higher - order lifshitz behavior is indicative of more than one length scale competing for stability , as would be expected for diblocks which each have a preferred lengthscale . for large @xmath16 ( and @xmath83 ) , the second order lifshitz lines remain stable and do not end .",
    "we have examined some aspects of phase separation in @xmath93 diblock copolymer blends . both macro- and",
    "micro - phase separation can occur , and microphase separation is a combination of the fundamental macrophase and microphase eigenmodes .",
    "we have demonstrated the possiblity of lifshitz points of first and second order , and our calculations ( limited at present by numerical precision ) suggest that lifshitz points of up to 5th order are , in principle , possible .",

    ". clearly , these calculations are illustrative of a rich phase behaviour which can be mapped by varying architecture and the three chi parameters .",
