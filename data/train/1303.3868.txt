    "consider a population of @xmath10 individuals , uniformly distributed in a two dimensional plane , with a single infected at the origin at the initial time . at the outbreak , it is sufficient to keep track of the positions of the infected , which will be marked as ` particles ' .",
    "the dynamics of the infected individuals is governed by the following stochastic rules . in a small time interval @xmath18 , each infected alternatively    0.2 cm    * ( i ) * recovers with probability @xmath19 .",
    "this corresponds to the death of a particle with rate @xmath4 .",
    "0.2 cm    * ( ii ) * infects , _ via local contact _ , a new susceptible individual from the background with probability @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to the birth of a new particle that can subsequently diffuse .",
    "the originally infected particle still remains infected , which means that the trajectory of the originally infected particle branches into two new trajectories .",
    "the rate @xmath21 replaces the rate @xmath17 in the sir or the galton - watson process mentioned before .    0.2 cm    * ( iii ) * diffuses with diffusion constant @xmath22 with probability @xmath23 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath24 of the particle get updated to the new values @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are independent gaussian white noises with zero mean and correlators @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ".    0.2 cm    the only dimensionless parameter in the model is the ratio @xmath31 , i.e , the basic reproduction number .",
    "consider now a particular history of the assembly of the trajectories of all the infected individuals up to time @xmath0 , starting from a single infected initially at the origin ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . for every realization of the process",
    ", we construct the associated convex hull @xmath32 . to visualize the convex hull , imagine stretching a rubber band so that it includes all the points of the set at time @xmath0 inside it and then releasing the rubber band .",
    "it shrinks and finally gets stuck",
    "when it touches some points of the set , so that it can not shrink any further .",
    "this final shape is precisely the convex hull associated to this set .    in this paper , we show that the mean perimeter @xmath33 and the mean area @xmath34 of the convex hull are ruled by two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that can be solved numerically for all @xmath0 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath0 can be determined analytically for the critical ( @xmath16 ) , subcritical ( @xmath15 ) and supercritical ( @xmath14 ) regimes . in particular , in the _ critical _ regime the mean perimeter _ saturates _ to a finite value as @xmath35 , while the mean area _ diverges logarithmically _ for large @xmath0 @xmath36 this prediction seems rather paradoxical at a first glance .",
    "how can the perimeter of a polygon be finite while its area is divergent ?",
    "the resolution to this paradox owes its origin precisely to statistical fluctuations .",
    "the results in eqs .",
    "[ [ mean_perimeter ] ] and  [ [ mean_area ] ] are true only on average .",
    "of course , for each sample , the convex hull has a finite perimeter and a finite area .",
    "however , as we later show , the probability distributions of these random variables have power - law tails at long time limits .",
    "for instance , while @xmath37 for large @xmath38 ( thus leading to a finite first moment ) , the area distribution behaves as @xmath39 for large @xmath40 .",
    "hence the mean area is divergent as @xmath35 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath41 , the evolution of the epidemic is controlled by a characteristic time @xmath42 , which scales like @xmath43 . for times @xmath44 the epidemic behaves as in the critical regime . in the _",
    "subcritical _ regime , for @xmath45 the quantities @xmath33 and @xmath46 rapidly saturate and the epidemic goes eventually to extinction .",
    "in contrast , in the _ supercritical _ regime ( which is the most relevant for virulent epidemics that spread fast ) , a new time - dependent behavior emerges when @xmath45 , since there exists a finite probability ( namely @xmath47 ) that epidemic never goes to extinction ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we later show that @xmath48 the ballistic growth of the convex hull stems from an underlying travelling front solution of the non - linear equation governing the convex hull behavior .",
    "indeed , the prefactor of the perimeter growth is proportional to the front velocity @xmath49 . as time increases , the susceptible population decreases due to the growth of the infected individuals : this depletion effect leads to a breakdown of the outbreak regime and to a slowing down of the epidemic propagation .",
    "characterizing the fluctuating geometry of @xmath32 is a formidable task even in absence of branching ( @xmath50 ) and death ( @xmath51 ) , i.e. , purely for diffusion process in two dimensions .",
    "major recent breakthroughs have nonetheless been obtained for diffusion processes  @xcite by a clever adaptation of the cauchy s integral geometric formulae for the perimeter and area of any closed convex curve in two dimensions .",
    "in fact , the problem of computing the mean perimeter and area of the convex hull of _ any generic two dimensional",

    "the frontier between the stationary asymptotic value @xmath47 ( stable ) and @xmath80 ( unstable ) moves forward with time at constant velocity , thus creating a travelling front at the right end , which separates the stationary value @xmath47 to the left of the front and @xmath80 to the right .",

    "<S> characterizing the spatial extent of epidemics at the outbreak stage is key to controlling the evolution of the disease . at the outbreak , the number of infected individuals is typically small , so that fluctuations around their average are important : then , it is commonly assumed that the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) mechanism can be described by a stochastic birth - death process of galton - watson type . </S>",
    "<S> the displacements of the infected individuals can be modelled by resorting to brownian motion , which is applicable when long - range movements and complex network interactions can be safely neglected , as in case of animal epidemics . in this context , the spatial extent of an epidemic can be assessed by computing the convex hull enclosing the infected individuals at a given time . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the exact evolution equations for the mean perimeter and the mean area of the convex hull , and compare them with monte carlo simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> odels of epidemics traditionally consider three classes of populations , namely , the susceptibles ( s ) , the infected ( i ) , and the recovered ( r ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the basis of the so - called sir model  @xcite , a _ fully connected mean - field _ model where the population sizes of the three species evolve with time @xmath0 via the coupled nonlinear equations : @xmath1 ; @xmath2 and @xmath3 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is the rate at which an infected individual recovers and @xmath5 denotes the rate at which it transmits the disease to a susceptible  @xcite . in the simplest version of these models , </S>",
    "<S> the recovered can not be infected again . </S>",
    "<S> these rate equations conserve the total population size @xmath6 , and one assumes that initially there is only one infected individual and the rest of the population is susceptible : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . of particular interest is the outbreak stage , i.e. , the early times of the epidemic process , when the susceptible population is much larger than the number of infected or recovered . during this regime , for large @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , the susceptible population hardly evolves and stays @xmath11 , so that nonlinear effects can be safely neglected and one can just monitor the evolution of the _ infected population alone _ : @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ultimate fate of the epidemics depends on the key dimensionless parameter @xmath13 , which is called the reproduction rate . if @xmath14 the epidemic explodes and invades a finite fraction of the population , if @xmath15 the epidemic goes to extinction , and in the critical case @xmath16 the infected population remains constant  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this basic deterministic sir has been generalized to a variety of both deterministic as well as stochastic models , whose distinct advantages and shortcomings are discussed at length in  @xcite . generally speaking , </S>",
    "<S> stochastic models are more suitable in presence of a small number of infected individuals , when fluctuations around the average may be relevant  @xcite . during the outbreak of epidemics , </S>",
    "<S> the infected population is typically small : in this regime , the evolution can be modeled by resorting to a stochastic birth - death branching process of the galton - watson type for the number of infected  @xcite , where each infected individual transmits the disease to another individual at rate @xmath17 and recovers at rate @xmath4 . the epidemic may become endemic for @xmath14 , becomes extinct for @xmath15 , whereas for @xmath16 fluctuations are typically long lived and completely control the time evolution of the infected population  @xcite .    how far in space </S>",
    "<S> can an epidemic spread ? </S>",
    "<S> branching processes alone are not sufficient to describe an outbreak , and spatial effects must necessarily be considered  @xcite . quantifying the geographical spread of an epidemic </S>",
    "<S> is closely related to the modelling of the population displacements . </S>",
    "<S> brownian motion is often considered as a paradigm for describing the migration of individuals , despite some well - known shortcomings : for instance , finite speed effects and preferential displacements are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , a number of recent studies have clearly shown that individuals geographically far apart can actually be closely related to each other through the so - called small - world connections , such as air traffic , public transportation and so on : then , the spread of epidemics among humans can not be realistically modelled without considering these complex networks of interconnections  @xcite . nonetheless , brownian </S>",
    "<S> motion provides a reasonable basis for studying disease propagation in animals and possibly in plants ( here , pathogen vectors are insects )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while theoretical models based on branching brownian motion have provided important insights on how the population size grows and fluctuates with time in a given domain  @xcite , another fundamental question is _ how the spatial extension of the infected population evolves with time_. assessing the geographical area travelled by a disease is key to the control of epidemics , and this is especially true at the outbreak , when confinement and vaccination could be most effective . </S>",
    "<S> one major challenge in this very practical field of disease control is how to quantify the area that needs to be quarantined during the outbreak . for animal epidemics , </S>",
    "<S> this issue has been investigated experimentally , for instance in the case of equine influenza  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most popular and widely used method for this consists in recording the set of positions of the infected animals and , at each time instant , construct a _ </S>",
    "<S> convex hull , i.e. , a minimum convex polygon _ surrounding the positions ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ; for a precise definition of the convex hull , see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the convex hull at time @xmath0 then provides a rough measure of the area over which the infections have spread up to time @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the convex hull method is also used to estimate the home range of animals , i.e. , the territory explored by a herd of animals during their daily search for food  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we model the outbreak of an epidemic as a galton - watson branching process in presence of brownian spatial diffusion . despite infection dynamics being relatively simple , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding convex hull is a rather complex function of the trajectories of the infected individuals up to time @xmath0 , whose statistical properties seem to be a formidable problem . </S>",
    "<S> our main goal is to characterize the time evolution of the convex hull associated to this process , in particular its mean perimeter and area .    </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we first describe precisely the model and summarize our main results . </S>",
    "<S> then , we provide a derivation of our analytical findings , supported by extensive numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with perspectives and discussions . </S>",
    "<S> some details of the computations are relegated to the supplementary material . </S>"
